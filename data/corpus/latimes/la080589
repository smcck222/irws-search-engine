Photo, PLIES DE RESISTANCE When the 65 members of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy 
get together each day, it's a combination of twists and turns, sweat and grace. 
And although it is called a class, you won't find books or desks, but toe shoes 
and leg warmers. The visiting Soviet dancers spend an hour each day with this 
routine. Then at night, it's on to one of their seven performances at the 
Pantages Theatre. The current tour is the first time in two decades that 
members of this internationally famed Academy have been seen in the United 
States. The dancers of this troupe are the future stars of the Soviet dance 
world and are the upper echelon of the Academy's rigorous eight-year program. 
Featured is Los Angeles native Michael Shannon, top, the first and only 
American member in recent memory who has been admitted to study with the 
Academy. The graceful legs at left belong to Galina Stepanyenko. Tatiana 
Doronina, above, performs exercises with class. GARY FRIEDMAN / Los Angeles

BRADLEY TO HOLD SUMMIT ON HIS LEGAL EXPENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has summoned a select group of longtime advisers and expert 
fund-raisers for a Saturday morning summit at the mayoral mansion to discuss, 
among other things, how to pay the mounting legal bills generated by the 
biggest crisis of his political career. 
</P>
<P>
A top Bradley aide acknowledged Thursday that the mayor had called the rare 
meeting in Hancock Park and that the agenda would center on how to raise money 
for the newly formed Bradley Officeholder Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to confirm reports circulating through City Hall that the committee is 
simply a thinly disguised legal defense fund, Bradley's in-house lawyer, Mark 
Fabiani, would say only: "I think the possibility of using part of the 
officeholder account funds for legal services will be discussed on Saturday, as 
well as the means of raising funds." 
</P>
<P>
During the last four months, at least six public agencies have initiated 
inquiries into Bradley's personal stock dealings and whether he used his 
official position to steer taxpayer money to business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has employed three prestigious law firms to represent him in the 
inquiries -- experts in securities law, trial work and political strategy. 
Fabiani declined to say how much the defense team has billed the mayor, calling 
such information a "private matter." 
</P>
<P>
But one veteran supporter who is knowledgeable about attorney fees said: "I 
would guess that his legal fees are astronomical. They probably are already in 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the guest list, it appears that the five-term mayor has decided to 
tap his substantial pool of political alliances to see him through a 
controversy that he has for the most part endured alone and that has tarnished 
his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Among those invited to Getty House are advisers who in previous terms helped 
make Bradley one of the nation's most influential Democratic politicians. Some 
clearly were under the impression that they were being called upon for their 
judgment, not their money. Those contacted Thursday evening said they had not 
been told specifically of the meeting's purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Dan Garcia, formerly Bradley's head of the city Planning Commission, 
said he was told simply that it is going to be "a meeting of supporters of the 
mayor. I have no idea what it is about." 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Nikolas Patsaouras, a Bradley-appointed zoning commissioner and 
prominent Democratic Party fund-raiser, said the message he got from the 
mayor's office indicated only that a few people were being brought together for 
a "briefing on the present situation." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a genius to figure out what the present situation is," he said 
with a sense of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others on List 
</P>
<P>
The entire guest list could not be determined by late Thursday. But a few of 
the others said to be on it include former public works Commissioner Maureen 
Kindel, a lobbyist who is one of Bradley's closest advisers; Recreation and 
Parks Commissioner Dick Riordan, a developer with key links to the business 
community; Joseph Cerrell, a veteran political consultant; airport Commissioner 
Johnnie L. Cochran, a politically connected attorney, and longtime fund-raiser 
Bruce Corwin, treasurer of the new committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley Officeholder Committee was formed July 19 -- the day before an 
explosive city audit was made public, leading to an extraordinary week of 
public hearings by a City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
In the report and in public testimony it was revealed that someone in the city 
treasurer's office had "whited out" a notation that indicated a $2-million 
deposit in Far East National Bank had been made "per the mayor." Bradley had 
been a paid adviser to the bank. It was also disclosed that the document was 
doctored to create the false impression that a required competitive bidding 
procedure had been followed. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani, the mayor's counsel, said the committee can spend the funds not only 
on legal bills but on "any expenses" the mayor has incurred "in connection with 
his public service." Under the law, they cannot be used to pay off campaign 
debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such committees are a new phenomenon in the city and have "sort of slipped 
through" without any public scrutiny, said Walter Zelman, executive director of 
California Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hahn's Opinion Sought 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said he is concerned about their legality and has asked City Atty. James 
K. Hahn for an opinion. The mayor's office noted Thursday that Hahn himself has 
such a committee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bradley has missed a mid-July deadline set by the California Fair 
Political Practices Commission to provide greater detail in his 1984 through 
1988 financial disclosure statements, FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC notified Bradley on June 23 that he had 20 days to revise the 
statements, which contain errors and omissions. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Glenn F. Bunting, Rich Connell and Frederick M. Muir 
contributed to this story.

AL MARTINEZ: BLOOD AND GLAMOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a media event of magnificent proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Ali MacGraw was there and Cathy Lee Crosby and Lou Ferrigno and Yako Smirnoff. 
</P>
<P>
Strobe lights blinked like diamonds on the Riviera, boxing writers stood on 
chairs to shout questions, and television sports anchors jockeyed for position 
with the skill of blooded yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Marilyn Monroe married Joe DiMaggio has there been such a mix of 
sweat and glamour on the celebrity circuit. 
</P>
<P>
I am speaking of Tuesday night's Mike Tyson Beverly Hills Press Conference 
&amp; Cocktail Party. 
</P>
<P>
Wait, don't leave. 
</P>
<P>
This is a new Champeen of the World we're talking about. Not the guy accused of 
knocking Robin Givens around, or grabbing that woman's behind in a bar or 
slapping a parking lot attendant in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
This is a sweet kid with a new attitude who is full of . . . well . . . as 
fight promoter Don King put it, "positiveness." 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be no more untoward incidents," King boomed from the head table of a 
room jammed with 150 reporters, photographers and television cameramen. His 
trademark wild-Afro-punk hairdo bristled with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a seven-figure deal here. The Japanese have reached out 
and touched a great, great star." 
</P>
<P>
The Champ nodded and smiled. His gold teeth flashed in the muted overhead 
light. Red Buttons shouted "Hooray!" 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the press conference in the Beverly Hills Hotel was to announce 
that Tyson is going to make Toyota commercials for release in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his problems in the United States, namely the aforementioned Robin 
Givens affair, the commercials will not be shown in this country until the 
positiveness of the Champ's new image effectively sweetens the negativeness of 
his old image. 
</P>
<P>
If he can refrain from punching or grabbing anyone outside the ring for a 
decent period of time, no doubt Tyson's ebullient persona will also grace 
American television screens as Toyota's chief huckster. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was explained to us by Don King who, in fact, dominated the 
proceedings. Tyson uttered perhaps 138 words during the hour, not counting "I 
dunno" and "uh huh," which may, at that, constitute a major part of his 
vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But then, I guess, grunts and mumbles are sufficient when your life consists of 
pounding people into the twilight zone. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's longest comment of the evening came when a woman television reporter, 
frustrated with his silence, asked, "Don't you talk?" 
</P>
<P>
The Champ responded with, "You're a pretty woman. I was lookin' to see if you 
was wearing a wedding ring." 
</P>
<P>
In less positive times he'd have no doubt thrown her over his shoulder and 
hauled her to his cave. 
</P>
<P>
During all of this, two television screens played tapes of Tyson's victories 
over 37 opponents, often freezing frame on the sprawled figure of a vanquished 
boxer staring at, but not seeing, the ceiling, or of another flying backward 
through the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
This is what the sports writers were there for, not Toyota and not 
positiveness, but the Champ's ability, as King put it, to "knock people down." 
</P>
<P>
I was at the press conference on the off-chance he might at least punch out a 
celebrity. I came away disappointed . . . positively. 
</P>
<P>
"This young man in sartorial splendor," the promoter said, "is a legend in his 
own time." 
</P>
<P>
The sartorial splendor of which King spoke included Tyson's white blazer and a 
tie that might have been purchased in a Las Vegas gift shop, but then working 
journalists are not known for their haute couture either. 
</P>
<P>
With some exception, media dress of the evening consisted of faded jeans and 
sport shirts, a state of dishabille that made even Tyson look good. 
</P>
<P>
The session's piece de resistance was King's announcement that the Champ's next 
opponent would be someone named Michael Dokes, who will no doubt also be beaten 
bloody in the name of, for lack of a better term, sport. 
</P>
<P>
When the press conference was over, wide double doors were thrust wide open and 
the Cocktail Party Phase of the festivities began in a large adjoining room, 
wherein most of the celebrities had already gathered. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of this was to send the photographers crashing forward like 
wildebeests in the Masai Mara, carrying me by sheer inertia to a position 
nose-to-nose with the Champ. Well, actually, nose to chest. 
</P>
<P>
I felt compelled to ask a question, so I said, "Will you jump? You know, like 
others in the Toyota commercials?" 
</P>
<P>
"I dunno," Tyson said thoughtfully. "I really dunno." 
</P>
<P>
Then he had his picture taken with Ali MacGraw, and I stood there pondering the 
uneasy synonymity of blood and glamour, and wondering at the consequence of 
their union.

A FASCINATION WITH ROCK-CLIMBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After his eight-day ascent of Yosemite's El Capitan, paraplegic Mark Wellman 
said he made the climb just because it was something he wanted to do. If it 
inspired other handicapped people, so much the better. As for his climbing 
partner, Mike Corbett was not overly concerned with his athlete's image. When 
Corbett was asked to recall his scariest moment, the pack-a-day smoker said it 
was when his carton of cigarettes almost fell off a ledge. Two thousand feet up 
El Capitan is not the place for nicotine withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide attention the climb received is just one manifestation of a 
growing fascination with rock-climbing in this country. Thousands of young men 
and women are establishing incredibly difficult new climbing routes in places 
like Smith Rocks in Oregon, Vedauwoo in Wyoming, the New River Gorge of West 
Virginia and even throughout the South. One of the nation's top woman climbers 
lives in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
For years, traditionalists claimed that publicity and competition were at odds 
with the notion that a virtuous mountain experience was two or three rumpled 
companions toiling up a remote virgin peak unknown to anyone. The only 
notoriety might come months later with a cryptic note in a climbing journal. 
But today, even the American Alpine Club supports climbing contests. A second 
annual international climbing meet will be held on an artificial climbing wall 
at Snowbird in Utah this summer. There will be television coverage, of course. 
If the truth were known, there always has been some form of competition: 
Climbers in the old days tried to keep their plans secret so they could beat 
their rivals to a coveted first ascent. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the hoopla is nothing compared to what it has been in Europe for 
decades. If it were, there also would have been intense television coverage of 
the weeklong Paul Piana-Todd Skinner ascent of the Salathe Wall on the same 
side of El Capitan last summer. They did what the best climbers had tried and 
failed to do for more than a decade: make the first free ascent of perhaps the 
best and most sustained rock climb in the world. This means they climbed the 
3,500-foot route without using their ropes and climbing gear except to hold 
them in the event of a fall. When the Salathe was first done during a 9 1/2-day 
stretch in 1961, Royal Robbins, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost could surmount many 
hundreds of feet of vertical and overhanging wall only by standing in nylon 
loops clipped to pitons hammered successively higher into cracks in the 
Yosemite granite. Piana and Skinner did pitch after pitch of sustained free 
climbing at levels of difficulty that were not believed possible in 1961. 
</P>

Another hot climber, Peter Croft, has done six classic Yosemite routes in a 
single day -- routes that required a cumulative 10 days by the accomplished 
climbers who made the first ascents in the 1950s and 1960s. Croft did them 
alone without a rope for protection against falls. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for such achievements. They include the evolution of 
quality lightweight climbing gear, shoes with super sticky rubber, access to 
good rock for long stretches of time, diets, training and specialization in 
certain types of climbs. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate frontier of climbing, however, is the frontier of the mind. The 
Piana-Skinner climb was stunning, but they had the advantage of several weeks 
of practice on the route in advance, working out the moves needed to overcome 
many of the hardest obstacles. When Robbins, Pratt and Frost first climbed the 
Salathe, no one had been there before. 
</P>
<P>
The unknown always has been a central element in climbing. As a specialized 
branch of mountaineering, competitive rock-climbing has evolved into a 
technical sport stripped of mystery and adventure. Some might think the same of 
Wellman's climb of El Capitan as he hauled himself by brute arm strength up a 
route that had been climbed many times before. But what a frontier of the mind 
Wellman had to cross first.

BOON FOR WILD RIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With barely a ripple compared to past save-the-river battles, California has 
added two streams to the state wild and scenic river system and protected a 
third from being plugged with any dams. These are the first additions to the 
state system since it was created in 1972 to protect the Eel, the Trinity and 
the Klamath rivers on the state's north coast. 
</P>
<P>
Newly protected under legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher 
(D-Palo Alto) are 10 miles of the East Carson River in Alpine County, 38 miles 
of the West Walker in Mono County -- both along the eastern Sierra -- and 53 
miles of the McCloud River and its tributaries in Siskiyou and Shasta counties 
in Northern California. While the McCloud was not accorded complete wild and 
scenic status, it is protected from dam construction. Landowners along the 
McCloud opposed full state protection because of a fear it would lead to 
federal wild-river designation and potential land condemnation, although that 
has not been federal practice. But even the ban on dams on this fine trout 
stream is a major achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The Sher bill did not sail through the Legislature without any challenge, 
although the measure passed the Assembly on a vote of 60 to 0 and the Senate 21 
to 1. The state Resources Agency had wanted a provision to allow a 12-year 
study period for possible dams on the East Fork of the Carson. There long has 
been discussion in Nevada of a structure that would back up a reservoir into 
California and flood a stretch that is popular with rafters. But the study 
provision was removed from the bill after Alpine County supervisors decided a 
free-flowing river was more important to their recreation and tourism 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was the outgrowth of a two-year Resources Agency study mandated by the 
Legislature. The agency supported the legislation even though the Nevada dam 
provision was deleted, and Gov. George Deukmejian signed the measure into law. 
The legislation is one of the most important environmental initiatives to come 
from the state Administration, and was a pleasant surprise to environmental 
groups. Both the governor and Legislature deserve credit for this welcome and 
significant contribution to California's limited inventory of wild and free 
rivers.

HUD SCANDALS AND SAM PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headline of your July 13 editorial about the HUD scandal, "Plugging Up the 
Loot Holes," prompted the following afterthought to the recent exchange of 
letters on the difference between liberals and conservatives: 
</P>
<P>
If liberals want to use conservatives' money to help people, it is obvious that 
conservatives want to use the people's money to help themselves! 
</P>
<P>
I salute the editor who dreamed up the term "loot holes." It describes 
perfectly the hypocrisy of the empty conservative ideology that puts profits 
before people, and symbolism over substance.

U.S. ANTI-SATELLITE PROGRAM: 'SPACE IS PART OF OUR SECURITY'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I totally go along with Rowny's idea that "We are entering an era in which 
space will be looked on as a medium rather than a barrier to man's progress. . 
. . " We don't need the B-2, we should cut aid to foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
If we could build two space-based platforms, we can accomplish the mission of 
both foreign aid and the B-2.

U.S. ANTI-SATELLITE PROGRAM: 'SPACE IS PART OF OUR SECURITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest, amusement, and dismay the column by Edward L. Rowny, 
"Space Is Part of Our Security" (Op-Ed Page, July 18). Interest, because Edward 
Rowny has been a Reagan-Bush Administration arms control adviser for many 
years; amusement over the tortured syntax and logic of his article; dismay that 
he is, indeed, our government's arms control adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The meat of Rowny's article is that without an anti-satellite program, the 
United States and our allies will be at the mercy of the Soviets, who, while 
complaining about our military space program, are the owners of the "world's 
only operational anti-satellite (ASAT) system." I believe it was last month 
that the Soviets' "operational ASAT facility" was opened to American observers, 
who were amazed and embarrassed at the primitive capabilities exhibited there. 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, an ASAT is not a defense against an ASAT, as Rowny seems to 
think, any more than a bullet is a defense against a bullet. The way American 
military satellites are protected from Soviet countermeasures is to harden them 
against radiation and provide them with means to detect and defend against 
attempts to blind the sensitive sensors on them. Ultimately, however, what 
protects our satellites is the consequences of making such a hostile gesture as 
to attack them. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing an ASAT is truly good for is a surprise, massive, first strike 
against the enemy's entire surveillance and early-warning system. If such an 
attack were ever launched, retaliation against the attacker's satellites would 
be absurd; we would have much more pressing matters to attend to here on the 
surface of the Earth, like kissing our world goodby. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that we should develop an ASAT as a sort of analog to the development 
of our naval forces in the last century to assure freedom of the high seas is 
specious reasoning. A closer analogy would be this century's tragic development 
of first airborne and then space-borne nuclear delivery systems, which have 
assured nothing but the stillbirth of rational arms control policies.

I see from the column by Rowny that one of the land mines left behind by 
President Reagan's Richard Perle and his "Pentagon Mafia" has just gone off. 
Again the target is the ABM treaty and the cause is Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
Rowny's claim that we need defenses in space has been proved tendentious, not 
to say disingenuous, frequently enough to make one wonder about his sincerity. 
The fact is that we would be more vulnerable in space conflict than the 
Soviets, who, for one thing, are less dependent on satellites for command and 
control than we, not to mention the whole fabric of our working society. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the space cadets of Reagan's Administration may claim, there is no 
defense for our satellites against the myriad projectiles that the Soviets 
could launch against them. 
</P>
<P>
Rowny's record in his eight years in the Reagan Administration is sharply 
outlined in the most valuable book we have on the subject: Strobe Talbott's 
"Deadly Gambits" (Vintage Books, N.Y., 1985). That record is a sorry one. 
</P>
<P>
Rowny originated the now completely discredited phrase, "window of 
vulnerability" (p. 220). He is cited as " . . . Notorious for changing his mind 
-- and for letting (former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard) Perle change 
it" (p. 295). And: "The director of the arms control and disarmament agency and 
the chief U.S. arms-control negotiator (Rowny) had come to symbolize the 
ineptitude and deviousness that many critics . . . associated with the 
Administration arms-control policies as a whole" (p. 299). 
</P>
<P>
There are many more of his footprints on the history of those frustrating 
years. We don't need any more of Rowny's obstructions to understanding and 
agreement.

U.S. RESPONSE TO MIDEAST TERRORISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are all outraged and frustrated over the latest barbaric act committed by an 
Iranian-controlled fundamentalist terrorist group in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent tragic, brutal execution of Higgins and the obscene threats to 
murder additional innocent Western hostages once again underscore the real 
obstacles to progress and peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
As Americans we are affected only occasionally by acts of barbarism and 
terrorism; the people of Israel live in the very midst of a culture of violence 
and war and endure it on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
As a nation that is regularly subjected to acts of terrorism, Israel has the 
right to defend itself. It would be a great injustice indeed if, in our 
frustration over our current inability to deal directly with the barbaric 
behavior of the Hezbollah, we were to strike out at our closest ally or remain 
silent while certain of our leaders unjustly criticize its actions.

'COMMOTION ALONG WITH THE DEVOTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take exception to a statement that "prayers to the saints came about through 
adjustments for cultures who worshiped many lesser gods before getting through 
to the great God." This statement is inaccurate because the early church 
fathers believed, as Catholic Christians continue to believe, that the saints 
in heaven and the saints on earth are members of a Communion of Saints and Body 
of Christ, and therefore can pray for each other. 
</P>
<P>
Asking a saint in heaven for prayers is no different than asking a 
friend/prayer partner on earth for prayers. Both are requests for secondary 
intercessions which are commended by Scripture. They are consistent with the 
primary intercessory role of Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5). 
</P>
<P>
Singleton apparently believes (as many Protestants do) that secondary 
intercessory prayers are limited to those on earth. That limitation has no 
scriptural basis and constitutes an "adjustment" of the faith passed on to us 
by the early church fathers.

STATE WARNS L.A. OF DUMPING FINES; 
</P>
<P>
$1,000-A-DAY THREAT IS LATEST ROUND IN GROWING FIGHT OVER LOPEZ CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State solid waste officials threatened Friday to fine the city of Los Angeles 
$1,000 a day unless operations are cut back at the city's Lopez Canyon 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The California Waste Management Board's orders escalated the growing conflict 
over alleged violations at the landfill. City officials said they will fight 
the orders in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The state wants to restrict the amount of daily dumping and reduce the 
long-term capacity of the landfill. If the city obeys the orders, said Edward 
J. Avila, president of the city Board of Public Works, the dump will be filled 
and shut down in about a year, heightening Los Angeles' trash crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The dump above Lake View Terrace receives two-thirds of the city's household 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State 'Unreasonable' 
</P>
<P>
"We will go to court to protect Lopez Canyon Landfill," Avila said. "What's 
incredible is that the state has chosen to attack the city's only landfill and 
is being totally unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Christopher M. Westoff said he will seek a temporary 
restraining order in Los Angeles Superior Court to halt the immediate effect of 
the state's orders. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said they intend to counter with a request for the court to 
force Los Angeles to abide by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The state's action was spurred by Los Angeles County's refusal to carry out 
earlier state orders to reduce intake at the landfill and limit the area in 
which trash can be dumped. The county Department of Health Services enforces 
state laws at Lopez Canyon, but refused to impose limits that would force the 
city to use county landfills, which are also filling rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The central issue is whether Lopez Canyon is bound by a restrictive 1978 state 
permit that limits trash intake to 400 trucks a day, caps the height of the 
landfill at 1,725 feet and confines dumping to 140 acres of the 392-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The state says the 1978 permit is valid. 
</P>
<P>
The city, however, says a less stringent, 1983 engineering report filed with 
the state had amended the permit. That report, which reflects current landfill 
operations, allows up to 600 trucks a day, a 1,740-foot height and a wider 
dumping area. 
</P>
<P>
The dump takes in about 4,000 tons of trash a day. The state orders would 
reduce that to about 3,100 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Permit Application 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to enforce the state orders, the county allowed city officials to 
operate under the 1983 permit as long as they applied to the state for a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped the county would enforce the orders," said Chris Peck, spokesman 
for the state Waste Management Board. "Our position is that the state is 
ultimately responsible for enforcing the permit." 
</P>
<P>
The city filed suit last month to settle the dispute. A Sept. 26 hearing date 
has been set. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the state is acting in bad faith because this matter is 
already before the court," Westoff said, adding that he believes the city is on 
firm legal grounds because it is abiding by the county order and has applied 
for a new permit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, both city and county officials argue that the state orders are not 
valid because they were issued by executive staff members of the waste board 
and not by a vote of its nine members. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said board regulations allow the executive staff to issue such orders. 
</P>
<P>
Lake View Terrace residents, who have long complained of noise, odors, blowing 
trash and heavy truck traffic in their hillside neighborhoods, expressed anger 
at the city's refusal to abide by state orders. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a waste of energy and taxpayers' money for the city to fight this," said 
Dennis Ghiatis, of the Kagel Canyon Civic Assn. "The time and money can be 
better spent solving the problems."

WOO WANTS TO SEE PLANS BEFORE BLOCK IS RAZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo has called for an environmental impact 
report on a Ventura Boulevard shopping center project that he said could create 
an "out-of-scale development" in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter released Friday by homeowner groups, Woo asked Building and Safety 
Director Warren O'Brien to order the center's applicant, Jacky Gamiel of Jama 
Enterprises, to address the effects of the development being planned for the 
13600 block of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The request came just two weeks after Los Angeles officials denied Gamiel's 
application for a permit to tear down stores on the block, including the former 
home of Scene of the Crime, a popular mystery bookstore. Woo said the 
demolition permit would be withheld indefinitely until the developer revealed 
specifics about the project. 
</P>
<P>
Gamiel evicted the Scene of the Crime and other tenants of the 46-year-old row 
of one-story storefronts this year. Only one tenant remains -- the restaurant 
Mary's Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Woo told O'Brien in the letter that he understood the project would total up to 
100,000 square feet in a "very sensitive area of Sherman Oaks." He said a 
project of that size could have a negative effect on traffic, air quality and 
the neighboring residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of out-of-scale development which might harm the community is 
very real," Woo wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Jama attorney Benjamin M. Reznik criticized Woo's request. "How can he be 
demanding an environmental impact report on a project he knows nothing about?" 
he said. "The only thing we've asked the city for so far is to demolish the 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said there were no specific plans, he added that the project under 
consideration is about 80,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said he had written the city Building and Safety Department asking for a 
demolition permit or "a written explanation on why it's being denied." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Sherman Oaks have said they plan to ask Los Angeles officials to 
award landmark status to the 1940s-era storefronts. Such a designation would 
stall the proposed development.

A LEGAL RIDDLE: CAN ACTOR WIN HIS $9-MILLION BATSUIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holy mirror image! Ex-Batman Adam West isn't doing battle with super-villains 
these days. He's fighting another Batman. 
</P>
<P>
West, who portrayed the Caped Crusader in the campy 1960s TV series, is asking 
for more than $9 million in damages from a group of advertising agencies that 
filmed television commercials with a non-West Batman. 
</P>
<P>
West claimed that the other Batman used West's "likeness, personality, voice 
and mannerisms" in a way that would make viewers believe they were watching 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for West and the agencies appeared before Burbank Superior Court 
Judge Stephen O'Neil Friday. O'Neil denied a motion from the agencies' attorney 
to dismiss the case and ordered the two sides to appear for trial on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small victory for Adam West on his way to trial," said one of his 
attorneys, Barbara Silcott. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials depict the Batman and Robin characters shopping during the 
Christmas season at Zayre's, a chain of discount stores, Silcott said. 
</P>
<P>
West's lawsuit, which was filed in August, 1988, claimed that the commercials 
had been shown numerous times in the United States since 1984 and that his 
"reputation as an actor" had been damaged. The suit alleged that West had 
endorsed several products and that his endorsement added credibility to the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"They just hired a person to imitate him because they didn't want to pay for 
the real thing," said Robert Winckler, another attorney for West. "They just 
can't hire someone to look alike or sound alike." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defendants Named 
</P>
<P>
The suit named Ian Leech and Associates, a Los Angeles firm; Ingalls, Quinn and 
Johnson, a Boston, Mass., firm and BBDO New York as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony E. Liebig, an attorney for the firms, said the agencies purchased the 
rights to the Batman character from DC Comics, who originated the crime 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>

SIMI'S HONORED POLICE ARE 2-, 4-LEGGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley is home of the Toughest Cop Alive and the Best Police Dog and 
Police Dog Handler in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The titles were earned in Vancouver, Canada, by three members of the Simi 
Valley Police Department at the World Police and Fire Games, a competition held 
every other year. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Bender, a 12-year veteran of the department, retained his 1987 
title as Toughest Cop Alive by winning 6,667 points out of 8,000 in a 
competition that included a three-mile run, 20-foot rope climb and 100-meter 
swim. Bender, 34, outscored 166 other officers and firefighters while 
competing, at his request, in the most difficult category -- men under 29. 
</P>
<P>
William Sterling Johnson, 45, and his police dog Atlas worked as a team to win 
a gold medal in the police canine competition, in which the dog jumped over 
such obstacles as a five-foot chain-link fence and detected in which of five 
boxes a suspect was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been a Simi Valley police officer for 18 years and Atlas, one of 
two dogs in the department, has been on the force for about three years. They 
scored 291.75 out of a possible 300 points.

GREEN VALLEY FIRE CONTAINED AFTER CHARRING 500 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brush fire that scorched more than 500 acres and briefly threatened 460 
houses in the remote community of Green Valley was contained Friday night, and 
a few separate, smaller fires of suspicious origin were quickly extinguished 
nearby, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fire started about 11:30 a.m. near San Francisquito Canyon Road and 
Spunky Canyon Road, within half a mile of the origin of a fire that burned 
2,250 acres and destroyed one home and two barns in June, authorities said. 
Like the earlier fire, Friday's blaze was apparently caused by man. 
Investigators found a book of matches at the spot where the fire started, said 
Bruce Bundick, U.S. Forest Service spokesman. But the exact cause of the fire 
remained under investigation, Bundick said. 
</P>
<P>
A firefighter was taken by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital 
in Valencia after he broke a leg battling the blaze on a steep hillside, Fire 
Capt. James Jeffries said. There were no other reported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
150 Yards From Houses 
</P>
<P>
No residents were evacuated, although some packed their valuables and left, 
authorities said. The fire came within 150 yards of several houses. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Sargent, who owns a house on Calle Maleza just north of the fire's edge, 
praised firefighters for keeping the flames at a distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the fire coming over the hill from the west," he said, as the blackened 
hillside behind him continued to smolder. "I strung out the garden hose, but 
you don't really need it when you've got so many firefighters to help you." 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was one of at least five fires -- all of suspicious origin -- 
reported in the Santa Clarita Valley area within a four-hour period Friday, 
Jeffries said. All started near roadsides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like somebody was just driving around and lighting them all," 
Jeffries said. "That's about how long it would take them to get from one to 
another." No suspects were in custody Friday evening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the smaller brush fires, which started about 1:20 p.m. near the Antelope 
Valley Freeway and Escondido Canyon Road south of Agua Dulce, burned less than 
two acres and was contained in one hour, Jeffries said. Half an hour later, 
another fire was quickly extinguished after it burned an acre at Avenue S and 
the Antelope Valley Freeway south of Palmdale, Jeffries said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burned 13 Acres 
</P>
<P>
Two additional brush fires -- one at Sierra Highway and San Fernando Road and 
the other on the grounds of a defunct alcoholism rehabilitation center in Santa 
Clarita -- started shortly after 3 p.m. and burned 13 acres, Jeffries said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. Scott E. Franklin said 450 firefighters battling the Green Valley 
fire were aided by favorable wind conditions that pushed the fire southeast 
along the shaded north side of a mountain range and kept it from moving north 
toward houses. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin said firefighters were especially lucky because drought conditions and 
the dying of old brush have created an extreme fire hazard in Southern 
California this summer. Brush moisture content in the area, normally between 
75% and 80% at this time of year, is only 60% -- the level normal for October, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got by the bullet this afternoon," Franklin said. "We were very concerned 
we were going to get spot fires across the fire break because the fire column 
shot so high."

PILOT INJURED IN PLANE CRASH DURING LANDING NEAR LANCASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private plane crashed while trying to make an emergency landing at General 
William J. Fox Airfield north of Lancaster on Friday, injuring the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Donald E. Simanski, 49, who suffered a head cut and a back injury, was in 
serious condition at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, 
where he was taken by helicopter about 20 minutes after his plane crashed just 
west of Sierra Highway near Avenue D-8. 
</P>
<P>
Simanski, a Lancaster resident flying a twin-engine Piper Apache, radioed the 
control tower at the airfield shortly before 12:40 p.m. and reported that he 
was losing power and would attempt an emergency landing, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Simanski attempted one landing approach, then told tower personnel he would 
have to try again, Sgt. Ron Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a low pass but did not land," Shreves said. "He said his left engine 
was out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plane Lost Power 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the plane lost power and altitude as it headed east, apparently 
preparing to turn into the wind and attempt another landing approach to the 
airfield about five miles to the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind just flipped him over," said Jim Deppe, who watched the incident from 
a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Anthony Matranga, said he was the first to reach the wreckage 
of the plane, which skidded across the field and through a barbed wire fence 
before stopping on its shattered nose and left wing. Simanski's head was 
bleeding, but he was conscious and able to talk, Matranga said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people who saw the crash or its aftermath helped pull Simanski from the 
cockpit before a sheriff's helicopter arrived, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation 
Safety Board and the airport said they had not yet determined the pilot's 
origin point and destination.

AGUA DULCE WOMAN ATTACKED BY BULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agua Dulce woman was gored in the chest and stomped by a bull Friday 
morning, leaving her with broken ribs and a bruised lung, the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred while Marge Seager, 40, was feeding a Holstein bull that 
she keeps on the grounds of her residence in the 35400 block of Anthony Road, 
Sgt. Mike Handley said. 
</P>
<P>
The bull apparently became enraged and charged at Seager, he said. It then ran 
off to another part of the compound, Handley said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was in serious condition Friday night in the intensive care unit at 
Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, he said.

ASTRO PITCHER GETS OFF SCOTT FREE IN EYES OF HERSHISER, DODGERS

What does The Times have against bike racing? 
</P>
<P>
There has been minor coverage of a few local events, some wire-service stories 
on international races and attention paid to Greg LeMond's Tour de France 
victory. But during this period The Times has carried three in-depth 
cycling-related stories: on Barbara Buchan's lawsuit against the U.S. Cycling 
Federation; on Cindy Olavarri's problems with steroids, and Randy Harvey's 
follow-up piece on Greg LeMond -- featuring the rumor that his last pro team 
sponsor wanted him to take a banned drug. 
</P>
<P>
That is too much scandal for the small substance The Times prints about bike 
racing.

If the Raiders leave (which I hope they don't), blame it on the Coliseum. That 
is the worst place to watch a football game. With the "Olympic" track and one 
end zone being about 100 yards away from the playing field, the crowd is 
totally removed from the game.

Why pay to go in a stadium when you can't even see the game?

If Hershiser never complained before, why now?

Is it because he's not on top of his game?

IRREGULARITIES IN OFFICIATING COST HARPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've noticed in the past years certain irregularities in the officials' 
decisions at Saugus race track but none so blatantly flaunted and so criminal 
as the one July 22 involving Will Harper. Harper drove a beautiful 100-lap 
race! He led for 92 laps until he was turned down on by another driver he was 
lapping. His car spun into the infield, he recovered fast enough to slide into 
second place and did not disturb any continuity in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
He was yellow flagged when it was obvious he could continue racing and possibly 
recapture first place, while during the previous races and during the same race 
other cars were allowed to sit in the infield for two laps or bring out a 
yellow flag and return to their previous position in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
I was especially upset to see this type of unsportsmanlike conduct by the 
officials. We've looked at many other poor decisions in the past and considered 
it a possible error in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot call this an error in judgment! This was so deliberate, I've been 
unable to sleep until I wrote this letter to someone who has the ability to 
publicly voice my outrage. 
</P>
<P>
I feel it's time some fans start objecting to this type of conduct.

DIGEST: HILLMAN EARNS A TRYOUT WITH JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Hillman of Glendale was one of seven Southern California Professional 
Basketball League players selected by the Utah Jazz this week to participate in 
the team's preseason camp, which begins in October in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman, a Hoover High graduate, was playing baseball for the Modesto A's, an 
Oakland Athletics affiliate in the Class-A California League, before he was 
placed on the temporary inactive list to pursue a basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to play basketball over baseball. It's been my goal," said 
Hillman, who added that he has not informed the Athletics of his decision to 
give up baseball this season. 
</P>
<P>
"(Making the cut) feels all right, but it's not going to do any good unless I 
make the team. I would have been disappointed if I wasn't asked back, but the 
goal isn't done yet." 
</P>
<P>
Despite redshirting his sophomore season, Hillman, 6-foot-3, averaged 6.4 
points a game in four years at Indiana. He also had a .310 career batting 
average in three seasons on the school's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
At Hoover, he shattered all the school's scoring records, averaging 41.3 points 
a game his senior season -- then the third-best average in Southern Section 
history -- and finishing with 2,213 career points. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Chieffo of Granada Hills shot a two-over-par 73 Friday to finish in sole 
possession of 11th place in the 23rd Pacific Coast Golf Assn. Amateur 
Championship at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Chieffo finished 14 strokes behind Texan Randy Sonnier, of who shot a 
three-under 68 to finish at 285 on the 6,808-yard South Course. Bryan Pemberton 
of Dublin, Calif., who plays at USC, and Robert Gomez of Las Vegas finished in 
a tie for second with 72-hole totals of 287. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Stankowski of Oxnard, second after the first round, shot a 78 to finish at 
302. Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys carded a 76 and finished at 303. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrious Phillips and Tony Davis, both of whom graduated from Antelope Valley 
High in June, have made oral commitments to play basketball at Antelope Valley 
College this season. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, a 5-11 guard, averaged a team-high 16 points a game last season and 
was named to the All-Golden League team. Davis, also an all-league selection, 
averaged 12 points and 10 rebounds at forward. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lorna Sawyer and Theresa Toliver said that they will play 
volleyball for the Marauders. Sawyer, a setter-outside hitter, was named team 
MVP at Antelope Valley High last season. Toliver, a middle blocker, was named 
Desert High MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gallien of Woodland Hills coached a six-member Southern California 
boys' junior tennis team to a national title Wednesday in the Intersectional 
National Championships in Columbus, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California defeated Florida, 4-3, in the final. The winning team, 
which included Stanford-bound Kenny Pedroza of Ventura High, was not seeded 
among the top five squads. Southern California advanced to the final by 
defeating the New England states, third-seeded Texas and the three-time 
champion South team, which was seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
Gallien, 28, is the men's co-coach at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Wright, formerly of Cal State Northridge, caught two passes for 22 yards 
in his professional football debut and former Poly High star Craig Ellis caught 
two touchdown passes to help the Edmonton Eskimos to a 22-21 win over the 
Toronto Argonauts in a Canadian Football League game Thursday night in 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first official game in two years for Wright, 25, who earned 
All-Western Football Conference honors with the Matadors in 1987. Wright was 
declared academically ineligible at CSUN two weeks before the start of the 
1988.

WORLD BASKETBALL LEAGUE PROVIDES PLAYERS A POSSIBLE SHORTCUT TO NBA

Fields of corn sag in the summer sizzle. A gray-white haze hangs over groves of 
pine trees like smoke in a tavern. A man shoveling asphalt into the cracked 
road leading to Anna Maria College 10 miles northwest of Worcester is enveloped 
in steam. 
</P>
<P>
The only noise at the center of this bucolic campus comes from an occasional 
car. But in the distance a faint, repetitive sound is heard. As one draws 
closer to the Fuller Activities Center, it becomes louder. 
</P>
<P>
Balls are bouncing and men are laughing. These boys of summer are playing a 
winter game. The Worcester Counts, one of five professional teams in the World 
Basketball League, are at work. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people today are thinking of going to the beach or of something cool," 
center Kevin McDuffie says. "For me, there's no place better than a hot gym." 
</P>
<P>
Each Count is counting on earning an opportunity to play in the NBA. Eight WBL 
players, including the Celtics' Kevin Gamble of the Illinois Express, were in 
the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
Even though some players may be short in inches -- WBL players can be no taller 
than 6-feet, 4 7/8 inches -- all have great expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best competitive summer basketball around," says Delray Brooks, 
the shooting guard on Providence College's 1987 Final Four team. "I'm confident 
I'll be going to an NBA camp." 
</P>
<P>
Former Purdue sharpshooter Troy Lewis says, "I could be playing street ball. 
But you can get into bad habits there. You take a bad shot, but you don't 
really care. You can't do that here. The only negative thing here is that some 
guys have to play out of position, like a shooting guard playing down low." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Gatlin smiles and points to his blue cap with "NBA" printed on it. "For 
me, trying to get to the NBA, this league is great," he says. "I'm 6-4 and 
played shooting guard at Maryland. I'm doing the same here." 
</P>
<P>
Gatlin watches a teammate's shot bounce off the rim and positions himself near 
the foul line. He receives a pass and leads a 3-on-2 break. 
</P>
<P>
"Outlet pass, go, go go," Counts Coach John Clark yells. He knows fast-break 
points will be essential if the Counts are to defeat the Youngstown (Ohio) 
Pride in back-to-back games at the Worcester Centrum. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Morgan, a beefy 6-4 center, needs two towels to wipe perspiration from 
his bare upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of practice, the Counts have two lines of players shooting 
beyond the three-point international and WBL stripe of 20 feet, 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The lineups are impressive. They include Gatlin, Brooks, Lewis and John 
Williams, the second all-time scorer at Indiana State behind Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Each side is encouraging its players and heckling the others. Laughter echoes 
in the home of the Anna Maria Amcats. 
</P>
<P>
When assistant coach Norm Van Lier, a former NBA player, sinks a shot, the game 
of 20 is over. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty? I thought it was 21?," Gatlin says. 
</P>
<P>
Van Lier flashes an impish smile and says: "No, no, it was only 20." 
</P>
<P>
Numbers. The WBL and the Counts are always in search of the right numbers. 
</P>
<P>
When the league was formed last year, it instituted its novel height 
requirement. This -- along with such rules as the first team to score seven 
points in overtime wins and no player can foul out -- accentuates a 
fast-breaking, high-scoring offense. 
</P>
<P>
The league has had some interesting tales of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an accounting firm, like the Academy Awards, that certifies that all 
players are under 6-5," WBL Commissioner Steven Ehrhart says. "Last year there 
was some question whether Anthony Jones, who was 6-7 at Georgetown and Nevada 
Las Vegas, was too tall. We went in and measured him (all measurements are done 
without sneakers with players on their backs), and he made it. . . . As far as 
measuring goes, no bent knees or crimped up necks are allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Another player who inched into the league was McDuffie. At Northeastern, he was 
listed as 6-8. But in the WBL, he's 6-4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a psych job in college. You know, having the other team think you're 
taller," he says. "I was ready for the measurement here because I got a haircut 
-- an extra low one." 
</P>
<P>
McDuffie's head is cleanshaven. 
</P>
<P>
State of the league and the Counts: Even with the WBL featuring such fine 
former college players as David Henderson (Duke), Keith Smart (Indiana) and 
Alfrederick Hughes (Loyola-Chicago), Ehrhart says pro basketball is a "tough 
summer sell." He says each WBL team is losing several hundred thousands of 
dollars a year and that such losses are expected in the league's development 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Each team's annual budget is $750,000 to $1 million. The other teams, besides 
Worcester and Youngstown, are Calgary, Las Vegas and Springfield, Ill. Players' 
salaries average between $12,000 and $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The WBL's 44-game regular season started May 10 and will conclude Aug. 25. The 
top four teams will compete in the "Four on the Floor" championship playoffs 
Aug. 27-Sept. 3 in Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
Five playoff games will be televised by SportsChannel America, which has helped 
sustain the league with a three-year, $2.1 million contract signed this year 
for 23 regular-season telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
The WBL is the only North American pro league that plays European foes, with 
the games counting in regular-season standings. Club teams from the Soviet 
Union, Greece, Italy, Holland, Finland and Norway are grouped as the 
Internationals in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrhart says the WBL will continue to operate next year. But he won't say which 
teams will return or emerge. He talks of expansion and of the day when the WBL 
will be playing home and away games in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The Counts, who drew a season-high 7,054 for their home opener against 
Youngstown on May 10, are averaging about 1,200 in the 13,800-seat Centrum. 
</P>
<P>
A banner draped over the Centrum's center court scorer's table says: "The World 
Is Coming To Worcester -- Count On It." 
</P>
<P>
But only 1,324 showed up for the Counts' recent game against the Pride. 
Assistant General Manager JoEllen Clark says the club's break-even point is 
2,500 to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Counts, who average 109 points, are thankful no NBA scouts are watching 
after scoring a season-low 11 in the first quarter. Most scouts are at their 
rookie camps. NBA scouts occasionally watch Counts games. The Celtics lead all 
NBA teams with eight appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly are some interesting players in the WBL," says Celtics scout 
Rick Weitzman, who has seen four Counts games. "We got one in Kevin Gamble. 
It's up-tempo, wide-open basketball. But you're not going to find any power 
forwards or centers there. You're pretty limited to it being a guards' league." 
</P>
<P>
The Counts' guards do not shine during the first three quarters. Neither do any 
of the other Counts. They are missing too many shots, not boxing out and 
playing defense occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such taped timeout songs as "Twist And Shout" and "We Will Rock You" 
reverberating in the arena, foot-stomping fans can't motivate the Counts. The 
Pride leads, 82-61, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But the Counts rally with Gatlin sinking three three-point shots and Brooks 
two, cutting the deficit to 101-96 with less than three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The spurt is short-lived. The Pride survives 18 fourth-quarter points from 
Gatlin to win, 115-102. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who finished with a team-high 29 points, including a club-record nine 
three-point baskets, slumps on a locker-room chair. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot-around tomorrow at 11," Van Lier says. 
</P>
<P>
The Counts shower and dress. There will be another game against the Pride in 21 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
They straggle from their locker room and down a dim corridor. Gatlin opens a 
side door, straightens his NBA cap and strides into the balmy night.

THE HELMS AMENDMENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a member of the creative community and as president of the American Society 
of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), I am deeply concerned about 
congressional actions that would bar federal funds to art deemed obscene, 
indecent or offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Government funding through the National Endowment for the Arts has worked -- it 
has encouraged creativity. I had a first-hand view of this process when I 
served on the NEA music panel during its early years. Government dictation of 
standards for deciding which artworks are acceptable for public funding was 
unimaginable then, as it should be now.

THE HELMS AMENDMENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms that would ban National Arts Endowment 
funding for "indecent or offensive works" has to be one of the most despicable 
pieces of legislation ever ("Arts Supporters Fear Amendment as Censorship 
Step," July 28, and "Senate Votes to Ban Funds for 'Obscene' Artworks," July 
27). 
</P>
<P>
It would mean that much controversial art would never see the light of day. We 
would be left with museums full of still lifes, Norman Rockwell paintings and, 
undoubtedly, plenty of U.S. flags. 
</P>
<P>
Even if this amendment (approved by the Senate July 26 and pending discussion 
in a conference with the House) is watered down or later nullified by the 
court, rest assured that Helms &amp; Co. will still have done its work. How 
many museums will decide not to book that challenging new artist or that 
potentially controversial work? 
</P>
<P>
I am ashamed of my own generation, which once was so vocal in support of 
political and artistic expression and dissent.

FACES . . .: HUMOR IS HIS WEAPON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Mel Gibson and Danny Glover get top billing in "Lethal Weapon 2," Joe 
Pesci is stealing scenes as Leo Getz, an excitable little accountant who has 
laundered a fortune in narcotics money. Each time Getz prefaces a remark with 
"OK, OK, OK" -- as if to rev himself up -- it generates more laughs. The 
crowd-pleasing turn is causing Oscar talk, and seems certain to boost Pesci's 
up-and-down career. 
</P>
<P>
"Some scripts are coming in, especially comedies," Pesci said from New York, 
where he's co-starring with Robert De Niro in director Martin Scorsese's gritty 
gangster drama, "Good Fellas" (formerly "Wiseguys"). "Before, I was only being 
offered 'Raging Bull'-type characters (meaning heavily dramatic). I guess 
'Lethal Weapon' shows a broader me." 
</P>
<P>
The problem now, he said, is that producers want to pigeonhole him another way 
-- broad, slapstick parts. "They're sending the wrong comedy scripts." He'd 
much prefer to find the humorous elements of a character within a dramatic 
framework. "We're looking at a lot of things and hoping a good thing will come 
along. Not like the last time -- the wrong things." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with the actor's struggle in the late '70s, Pesci quit and was 
managing a restaurant in the Bronx when De Niro and Scorsese caught him in a 
small film called "Death Collector." Scorsese cast Pesci in "Raging Bull" 
(1980) as the combative brother of boxer Jake LaMotta (De Niro's character) -- 
and Pesci was Oscar-nominated for best supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination was "nice," he said, but he made the mistake of "letting myself 
get all wrapped up in it." When Timothy Hutton won for "Ordinary People," the 
bubble burst. "The other four (nominees) are forgotten so quickly," Pesci 
recalled painfully. "It's very hard. Some things you don't know if it hurts or 
helps." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in "Eureka" for director Nicolas Roeg, "Easy Money" with Rodney 
Dangerfield, "I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can" with Jill Clayburgh, among others. 
But most were unpopular. He barely paid the bills, and at one point went almost 
two years without a job. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the success of "Lethal Weapon 2," he's back in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do interviews on 'Raging Bull,' " he said. "I don't like to put my 
kisser up front. (But) this time I did a lot more interviews and helped promote 
the movie. They like that in Hollywood. We'll see if it makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
He put People magazine "on hold," however -- the weekly wanted to photograph 
him at home with his family and "talk about personal stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," Pesci said. "We'll leave that to the superstar types." JOHN 
M. WILSON

VOYEURS' CONCEIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hats off to the infantile conceit of the dirty-minded voyeurs who think women 
nurse babies in restaurants for the sake of entertainment (Saturday Letters, 
July 15)! Because these misogynists have so little concern for the children of 
our society, we will probably suffer many more generations just like them. 
</P>
<P>
Women don't need to be ashamed of their breasts because some men can't get 
their brains out of their underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Many cathedrals have statues depicting the Madonna nursing the infant Christ. 
I'm sure this is pure exhibitionism on the part of the Mother of God.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS: OSBOURNE AS THE HUNCHBACK OF IRVINE MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Putting Ozzy Osbourne in front of a theater full of teen-agers is like putting 
Quasimodo in charge of Romper Room. But far from recoiling in horror, the tots 
go delirious with glee. 
</P>
<P>
Osbourne's show at Irvine Meadows on Thursday was both engaging and pathetic. 
Engaging because of the energy and single-mindedness with which the heavy-metal 
gnome set about giving 10,000 or more kids a good time. Pathetic because of the 
British singer's obvious need to have that approval -- a need that sidetracked 
his 90-minute set and deprived it of meaning and focus as he carried on 
constantly as cheerleader and rabble-rouser. 
</P>
<P>
Like Quasimodo, Osbourne at his best has cried out memorably for sanctuary, in 
songs that express horror at the threat of nuclear war, or confess Osbourne's 
own sense of inner confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Osbourne played some of those songs during his set, including "Iron Man," 
"Paranoid," and "War Pigs," three enduring grunge-rock songs from his Black 
Sabbath days. The problem was that but none of them meant a thing -- at least 
not as Osbourne presented them Thursday. Taking off shoes and socks and tossing 
them into the crowd may be endearing, but what did it have to do with "War 
Pigs"? That was the pattern throughout the show: Ham it up, be Ozzy. Don't 
worry if the story gets lost or ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The music had force, with former Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler and drummer 
Randy Castillo providing a driving foundation and guitarist Zakk Wylde doing a 
Ted Nugent gonzo-rock imitation. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed White Lion's set could have used a lot more roar from singer Mike 
Tramp, an extremely limited vocalist whose husky but bodiless voice seemed 
incapable of sustaining a note. Vito Bratta, a flashy, talented guitarist, gave 
the 50-minute set its bite. 
</P>
<P>
Vixen, an all-female band, turned in an opening set that was energetic, 
unpretentious and well-played, although it stuck firmly to unimaginative 
pop-metal formulas. MIKE BOEHM

POP MUSIC REVIEWS: UNEVEN VIBRATION FROM REGGAE TRIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Jah is the strength of my life." That regulation-issue reggae lyric took on an 
added dimension during Israel Vibration's hour-plus performance before a packed 
house at the Music Machine on Thursday. The vocal trio, Jamaican-born but now 
New York-based, were childhood polio victims -- Cecil Spence and Lacelle Bulgin 
used arm braces and Albert Craig a cane to support themselves on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The three singers democratically split lead vocals, but the constant shifting 
of position at the center mike slowed the pace. The Roots Radics band provided 
powerful backing, as well as persistent feedback that frequently obscured the 
harmony vocals. While the music kept the audience locked in a slow, steady sway 
throughout the set, Israel Vibration's performance only occasionaly rose above 
the level of proficient reggae grooving. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Chaplin was more successful during his 30-minute opening set. He's one 
of the few artists working in the rap/sing deejay style who eschews "slackness" 
(sexually boastful lyrics), and he had some of the grainy, gritty quality of 
the late Peter Tosh. His forceful stage presence made that maddening deejay 
habit of suddenly interrupting and then re-starting a song halfway palatable.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS: 'QUIET STORM' HAS SOME GENUINE THUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Quiet Storm" radio format might be better termed "Lingering Morning Haze" 
for its presentation of overly synthetic, emotion-bleached music. The "Quiet 
Storm" tour that brought singers Phyllis Hyman and Cherrelle and the 
fusion-based Pieces of a Dream band to Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Thursday 
certainly had some of those qualities, but it also featured some genuine 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces of a Dream opened with its predictably bland fusion-funk. They then 
backed Cherrelle through a four-song set, highlighted by "Crazy (For Loving 
You)" and the hit "Everything I Miss at Home," which displayed both a nimble, 
octave-swooping voice, and an absence of the emotional weathering necessary to 
make her notes felt. 
</P>
<P>
Even when singing barefoot, as she did Thursday, the 6-foot-1 headliner Hyman 
is a statuesque presence on stage. Her voice is easily the match of her image, 
steering a smooth but never slick course between R&amp;B burner and jazz 
stylist. Though sometimes a bit too reserved, Hyman pulled out the stops on the 
hit "Living All Alone" (which included a whistling solo), "Meet Me on the Moon" 
and the Philly soul ballad "What Ever Happened to Our Love."

SOLOISTS DOMINATE FESTIVAL CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Strawberry Creek Music Festival, in full swing at Pepperdine University, 
offered one of conductor Yehuda Gilad's specialties Thursday night in Smothers 
Theatre: a terrific early-18th-Century grab-bag program, served up by a Baroque 
orchestra and featuring some dazzling solo playing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Baroque Biggies, Bach, Handel and Vivaldi, there were works by 
Pietro Baldassare and Jan Dismas Zelenka. 
</P>
<P>
Gilad and forces began in polished mid-season stride with Handel's "Agrippina" 
Overture. Gerard Reuter executed the solo oboe recitativo in perfect imitation 
of the sensitivity and emotional eloquence of the human voice. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare's Sonata No. 1 in F for Cornetto, Strings and Continuo, became a 
tour de force through trumpeter Anthony Plog's impeccable breath control, 
refined dynamics and flawless runs. 
</P>
<P>
Zelenka was represented by his Five Capriccios (1729). Richard Todd strove 
valiantly with its daunting writing for horn, and with self-critical honesty 
resisted taking a bow because he fell short of his mark. 
</P>
<P>
Soloist Kenneth Munday's technical abandon and secure musicality made an 
excellent case for Vivaldi's snappy, demanding A-minor bassoon concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Bach's "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 1 began, as it does often, with the 
challenging harmonies and syncopated horn rhythms of the opening Allegro 
sounding like bobbles. 
</P>
<P>
But thereafter, Gilad's buoyant direction, the precision and clarity of string 
playing and the superbly executed sextet in the Menuetto (with Todd redeeming 
himself) carried the performance on a consistently high level. BRUCE BURROUGHS

WRITER MAY ALTER QUOTES, COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major First Amendment decision, a federal appeals court ruled Friday that 
a journalist may deliberately alter quotations provided that the fabricated 
quotations reflect the essence of what a public figure said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena upheld a lower 
court dismissal of a libel suit filed by writer-psychoanalyst Jeffrey M. Masson 
against author Janet Malcolm and her publishers, The New Yorker and Alfred A. 
Knopf. The suit asserted that the magazine articles, subsequently reprinted in 
book form by Knopf, misquoted Masson and made him appear unscholarly, 
irresponsible, vain and lacking integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from two December, 1983, New Yorker articles Malcolm wrote 
about how Masson was fired from his position as projects director of the 
Sigmund Freud Archives. The articles were largely based on 40 hours of 
Malcolm's tape-recorded interviews with Masson. 
</P>
<P>
At issue were at least a dozen quotations attributed to Masson, including one 
in which he was purported to have described himself as an "intellectual 
gigolo." He said he never made the statement. 
</P>
<P>
The majority opinion, written by Judge Arthur Alarcon, said Masson had failed 
to show that Malcolm and her publishers had acted with actual malice, even 
though she deliberately altered quotes, because she believed that the quotes 
reflected the essence of statements Masson made to her. Judge Cynthia Holcomb 
Hall joined in Alarcon's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
As a public figure, Masson had to show both that the statements in question 
were false and that Malcolm had acted with actual malice, a standard enunciated 
by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of New York Times vs. Sullivan in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Majority Opinion 
</P>
<P>
The majority opinion held that malice could not be inferred from the evidence 
of deliberately altered quotations if the fabricated quotations are either 
"rational interpretations" of ambiguous remarks made by a public figure or do 
not "alter the substantive content" of unambiguous remarks made by a public 
figure. The majority opinion acknowledged that "it is uncontroverted that 
Malcolm fictionalized certain quotations and attributed them to Masson." 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon distinguished between Malcolm's altering of quotations and a writer's 
use of statements attributed to an individual that are "wholly the product of 
the author's imagination." He cited a case where this happened in an article 
about Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Alex Kozinski issued a lengthy and ringing dissent. "While courts have a 
grave responsibility under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the 
press, the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a 
concomitant of a free press." 
</P>
<P>
He quoted a number of journalism textbooks and statements from authorities in 
the field on the vice of creating or doctoring quotes, in particular because 
quotes are considered more authoritative than paraphrases from a writer. 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski concluded his opinion by stating: "Truth is a journalist's stock in 
trade. To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said 
is to assert the right to lie in print. To have that assertion made by The New 
Yorker, widely acknowledged as the flagship publication when it comes to truth 
and accuracy, debases the journalistic profession as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
But Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment lawyer who has frequently 
represented the New York Times, applauded the decision. "I think the majority 
rightfully protects Malcolm's speech even though people could differ as to 
whether it was proper to put certain things in quotes or compress what Masson 
said in order to make it easier to read," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important ruling because the law has been in a state of some confusion 
as to what inferences, if any, may be drawn from the use of quotations which 
approximate but are not exact copies of what was said," Abrams said. "The 
court's ruling today affords considerable protection to a journalist as long as 
she has not engaged in a wholesale fabrication." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significance 'Limited' 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Karst, a UCLA law professor who is a constitutional law specialist, 
called the case "doctrinally interesting" after a summary of the decision and 
several key passages were read to him. "The New York Times rules require that a 
plaintiff prove falsity and malice. . . . It sounds (like) . . . the majority 
here is tying those two issues together and saying if it isn't very false it 
can't be malicious." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said "the significance of this for journalists may be very limited. 
I would think most journalists want to use accurate quotations and would try 
hard to do that. If there were transcripts, most journalists would want to use 
the transcripts." 
</P>
<P>
Masson attacked the decision in a telephone interview from his home in Berkeley 
and said he would appeal to the Supreme Court. "If this becomes the law of the 
land -- that quotation marks do not guarantee the accuracy of what is contained 
between them -- it plays havoc with the whole profession of journalism," said 
Masson, 48. He said he recently signed a contract to write his autobiography, 
"The Making and Unmaking of an Analyst." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm did not return calls placed to her summer home in Massachusetts. One of 
her lawyers, Neil Shapiro, a libel specialist with Cooper, White &amp; Cooper 
in San Francisco, said he was pleased with the outcome. "Although the quotes 
(in question) were not verbatim, I'm delighted that the court looked through 
that technicality and saw it was the substance of what (Masson) said." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling comes amid a heated controversy in the journalistic community 
surrounding two articles Malcolm wrote in The New Yorker last March which 
asserted that "every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to 
notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is 
a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, 
gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm's critics have noted that she did not disclose in the articles that she 
herself had been sued for libel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clash Described 
</P>
<P>
In the articles that were the subject of Friday's decision, Malcolm described 
the clash between Masson and the archive's board members, principally Dr. Kurt 
Eissler and Dr. Anna Freud, over Sigmund Freud's abandonment of his "seduction 
theory" -- a hypothesis that assumed certain mental illnesses were generated by 
sexual abuse during childhood. Masson asserted that Freud discarded the theory 
to placate colleagues and further his career. 
</P>
<P>
Masson's contentions, published in his book "The Assault on Truth: Freud's 
Suppression of the Seduction Theory," which came out just months after 
Malcolm's articles, earned him the enmity of most traditional psychoanalysts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit centered on a dozen quotes that Masson asserted were altered or never 
uttered. One of the most controversial passages is a quote Malcolm attributes 
to Masson referring to himself as an "intellectual gigolo" while telling her 
about his discussions with Eissler and Anna Freud. 
</P>
<P>
"They loved to hear from me what creeps and dolts analysts are," the passage 
said. "I was like an intellectual gigolo -- you get your pleasure from him, but 
you don't take him out in public." 
</P>
<P>
The opinion noted that this quote is not to be found in Malcolm's tape-recorded 
interviews. The quote does appear in a typed version of handwritten notes 
Malcolm said she made while interviewing Masson in New York. Malcolm testified 
that she lost the originals. 
</P>
<P>
Masson asserted that the quote and the typed notes were fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
In one taped interview, Masson actually said that Eissler and Anna Freud "felt, 
in a sense, I was a private asset but a public liability. They liked me when I 
was alone in their living room and I could talk and chat and tell them the 
truth about things and they would tell me. But that I was, in a sense, much too 
junior within the hierarchy of analysis, for these important training analysts 
to be caught dead with me." 
</P>
<P>
The majority opinion said that the term "intellectual gigolo" is not 
defamatory. And Judge Alarcon wrote that "while it may be true that Masson did 
not use the words 'intellectual gigolo,' Malcolm's interpretation did not alter 
the substantive content of Masson's description of himself as a 'private asset 
but a public liability' to Eissler and Anna Freud. 
</P>
<P>
"The district court did not err in determining that Masson did not prove by 
clear and convincing evidence that Malcolm acted with malice in attributing the 
words 'intellectual gigolo' to Masson." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kozinski took sharp exception to this analysis. "For an academic to refer 
to himself as an intellectual gigolo is such a devastating admission of 
professional dishonesty that a jury could well conclude that it is libelous. . 
. . I fail to see how the term can fairly be derived from Masson's actual 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm's story said the conversation occurred while she and Masson were having 
lunch at Chez Panisse, a Berkeley restaurant. "Malcolm now admits that the 
statement was made at a different time and place, while Masson was visiting her 
in New York," Kozinski said.

TINKERS WITH DIPLOMACY, DEFENSE;

CONGRESS DETERMINEDLY MEDDLES IN POLICY-MAKING

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever former President Ronald Reagan accused Congress of tinkering too much 
with national security policy, his antagonists on Capitol Hill always had a 
ready answer: They were forced to do it because the President never consulted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But now that relations between the White House and Congress have entered a new 
era of cooperation and consultation under President Bush, it appears that 
Reagan's complaint may have been justified after all. 
</P>
<P>
In the final weeks before Congress' monthlong August recess, members of the 
House and Senate once again engaged in their annual ritual of trying to 
legislate the jots and tittles of American foreign and defense policy -- 
everything from overall nuclear strategy to the smallest personnel policies. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) sees these latest efforts at micromanagement as a 
bad faith response by Congress to the pledge of cooperation that Bush made in 
his inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
To Boren, it proves that his colleagues are more interested in seeking 
sensational headlines than assisting in the development of a coherent foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to me that the Administration is seeking to do its part, and I am 
disappointed that we, as an institution, have failed to live up to our 
responsibility to work in a responsible way, a non-sensational way" to resolve 
concerns through consultation, Boren told his colleagues in a recent floor 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Congress' unflagging passion for fiddling with the details of foreign and 
defense policy has been most apparent in the Senate, which during the last 
three weeks has made numerous adjustments in the legislation authorizing 
spending for the State Department and the Pentagon for fiscal 1990. In all, the 
Senate considered 83 amendments to the defense bill and 78 amendments to the 
State Department measure. 
</P>
<P>
Some amendments challenged the fundamental principles behind the Bush 
Administration's policy. On the defense bill, for example, some senators called 
into question Bush's decision to fund the development of new strategic nuclear 
weapons at the expense of many less costly conventional weapons and of domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower-Level Issues 
</P>
<P>
But most of the Senate amendments focused on issues that are usually decided 
not in the Oval Office but at the lower levels of the bureaucracy -- issues 
such as a $100,000 contribution to the Ukrainian Famine Commission or Coast 
Guard policy for apprehending drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
If fact, many amendments call for actions that are not even within the power of 
the U.S. government to carry out. One such amendment, proposed by Sen. Connie 
Mack (R-Fla.), called for a plebiscite in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Quite frequently, opponents of these amendments urge their colleagues to vote 
against them on grounds that they represent unwarranted micromanagement of 
foreign policy. However, even some senators who make this argument are later 
accused of micromanaging government policy themselves. 
</P>
<P>
During consideration of the State Department bill, for example, Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N. C.) railed against micromanagement when Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) proposed an amendment designed to prevent a recurrence of the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Helms later offered a proposal to halt negotiations with Palestine 
Liberation Organization leaders, he was accused by Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) of doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
One of the favorite tactics of congressional micromanagers is to require the 
bureaucracy to provide Congress with a report on any matter of concern. As a 
result, according to a study conducted by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), the 
government must now submit an estimated 5,000 reports a year to Congress on 
everything from arms control to morale in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Boschwitz said that the proliferation of these reports proves that "Congress 
has become a micromanager that can't manage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waste of Money Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Is there really a need for the secretary of defense to report biennially to 
Congress on special pay for health professionals?" Boschwitz asked. "These 
kinds of reports do not improve our management of the Pentagon. They only waste 
money and distract us from our more important responsibilities of oversight." 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Defense Department annually devotes 370 man-years to 
producing more than 600 reports required by Congress. And the House-passed 
defense spending bill for fiscal 1990 calls for an additional 215 reports from 
the Pentagon next year -- a 32% increase over the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Boschwitz sought to eliminate all Pentagon reporting requirements in the 
defense spending bill, which cleared the House on Wednesday, but his amendment 
was ruled out of order. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reagan often complained bitterly about congressional micromanagement 
during his eight years in office, leaders of the Democratic-controlled Congress 
usually dismissed his lament as nothing more than partisan sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Team Fights Meddling 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, however, the bipartisan team of Boren and Sen. John C. 
Danforth (R-Mo.) has made it a personal mission to reduce congressional 
tinkering in national security policy by speaking out on the issue whenever an 
opportunity has arisen. 
</P>
<P>
Boren and Danforth thought they had finally made some progress earlier this 
year when Bush, after pledging cooperation with Congress in his inaugural 
address, established a formal mechanism to provide for consultation on all 
matters of national security. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders as well as ranking members of the House and Senate 
committees on foreign relations, armed services and intelligence now meet 
regularly with the President to discuss important decisions facing the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But the two senators now realize that that effort has changed nothing. Members 
of Congress still believe -- as Boren puts it -- "that, at least for 10 minutes 
on the Senate floor, they should act as secretary of state of the United States 
or perhaps try to act on behalf of the President of the United States in making 
foreign policy for this country." 
</P>
<P>
Boren, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, contends that the Senate's 
habit of meddling with foreign policy not only usurps the prerogative of the 
President to conduct diplomacy but sends a confusing signal to U.S. allies and 
enemies alike. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing diminishes the influence of this country more than our failure to 
speak to the rest of the world with a single voice," Boren said. "Nothing is 
more damaging when we are dealing with sensitive international issues than to 
have amateur hour on the floor of the United States Senate in which each and 
every one of us decide to weigh in on sensitive issues that have been 
delicately balanced and negotiated between our country and other nations." 
</P>
<P>
And how do Boren and Danforth hope to deal with the problem now? A report, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate earlier this week voted for a Boren-Danforth amendment to the 
defense spending bill that requires the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in 
consultation with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, to issue a report by 
Dec. 31 on "the appropriate relationship between the legislative and the 
executive branches with respect to the formulation of United States foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>

UTILITIES WIN EXTENSION ON SMOG DEADLINE

<P>
In a major victory for electric utilities, regional air quality officials voted 
Friday to give the industry 10 years to slash smog-creating emissions. The 
decision ends a longstanding dispute that had threatened to cripple a sweeping 
clean-air plan for the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District vote to impose a 1999 deadline 
was hailed by the Southern California Edison Co., which had earlier threatened 
possible legal action if a stricter emissions deadline were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a poor alternative (with) some board members choosing to go 
along with what Southern California Edison would like," said director Sabrina 
Schiller, who wanted an earlier deadline for retrofiting equipment with new 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nineteen ninety-nine is giving away the store as far as I am concerned," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's decision, which came after nearly eight hours of testimony and debate, 
repudiated a board panel's decision to make companies comply with the new rule 
by 1996. Even that deadline had been a compromise of an earlier schedule that 
called for compliance by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The board's 7-3 vote came at a time when the air quality board is under fire 
for being too hard on industry. In fact, the state Air Resources Board, which 
must approve the 20-year clean-air plan, recently delayed a vote on the 
sweeping proposal because of grumbling by industry. 
</P>
<P>
Mike M. Hertel, Edison's environmental affairs manager, said Friday's decision 
shows that the district can be "fair" to business. 
</P>
<P>
The standards adopted Friday, calling for a nearly two-thirds reduction in 
emissions, are similar to those included in earlier proposals. Nitrogen oxide 
emissions from the basin's electric power generators will be cut from 44.4 tons 
a day to 15 tons. The plants now generate 4.3% of the total emissions of 
nitrogen oxide, which can cause lung damage, premature death, obscured 
visibility and a brown haze. 
</P>
<P>
The district estimated the cost to utilities and other power generators at $682 
million, a fraction of the amount claimed by the companies and utilities. The 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for instance, said the new rules 
will cost it $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials predicted that they will raise rates 2% or nearly $1 on 
monthly residential bills to cover their costs. The DWP estimated rate hikes of 
7% to 10% or up to $4 a month, while utilities in Pasadena, Glendale and 
Burbank forecast increases of up to 15% or $4 a month. Most of the hikes will 
probably not take effect until closer to the 1999 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the earlier emissions deadlines said they would give utilities too 
little time to build new boilers that not only could meet the pollution 
requirements but also save energy and money in the long run. Instead, they 
argued, the firms would have to hurriedly put controls on outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Director Larry Berg, who favors stricter deadlines, seized on that argument in 
aiming for a stronger rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not interested in supporting a rule that is going to put equipment on 
equipment that shouldn't be in the basin," Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
So he proposed that companies willing to build new systems be given until 1999 
to comply, whereas those planning only to retrofit meet the earlier 1996 
deadline. The board narrowly defeated his motion. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and DWP officials had argued that customers would have faced power 
outages under the 1996 deadline, even though they admitted that technically, 
they could meet it. Edison officials say they plan mostly to retrofit their 
equipment, while the DWP plans to completely rebuild about half its boilers. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Abramowitz, program director for the Coalition for Clean Air, said the 
board's vote showed "they can't stand up to big business." He predicted that it 
would add "fuel" to discussions by environmentalists of putting their own 
clean-air plan on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for the 1999 deadline were members Stephen Albright, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, S. Roy Wilson, Robert Hammock, Carole Beswick, Leo 
King and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against it were Schiller, Berg and Henry Wedaa, the board panel that has 
pushed for the tighter deadline. Directors A. Norton Younglove and Orange 
County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder were absent.

IRAN OFFERS HELP IN HOSTAGE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
RAFSANJANI SAYS U.S. MUST SWAY ISRAEL AND AVOID MILITARY MOVES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Making a direct offer to Washington, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said 
Friday that he is ready to help resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon and 
cautioned that American military might is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, speaking at a Tehran University prayer service, also demanded that 
the Bush Administration pressure Israel to free a Lebanese Shiite Muslim 
clergyman whose abduction eight days ago sparked the current tensions. 
</P>
<P>
But the emphasis of Rafsanjani's remarks appeared designed to cool a situation 
that has led to U.S. Navy deployments in the Mideast, although the White House 
has largely played down its military options this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reasonable Solutions' 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions, the freeing of 
the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions," he told his 
university audience in the Iranian capital. The speech, broadcast on Tehran 
radio, was monitored here in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's military moves appeared a top concern of the new president, 
speaking at his first Friday prayer session since being inaugurated Thursday as 
revolutionary Iran's fourth president and as the political successor to the 
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems," 
the 55-year-old clergyman-politician declared. "Come, let us approach the 
problem reasonably." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We too will help solve the problems there, so the people of the 
region can live in peace and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Early today, official Algiers Radio reported that progress in the hostage 
crisis was made in Beirut on Friday in talks in which Khaled Hasnawi, Algeria's 
ambassador to Lebanon, was involved, according to a dispatch from Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
The Algerian broadcast said that Hasnawi met with U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding 
and with Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the Shiite Hezbollah 
(Party of God) organization, in talks involving all hostages, whether 
"Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress Reported 
</P>
<P>
"Progress in this mediation was accomplished Friday," Algiers Radio said 
without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iran is regarded as the key outside influence, for both ill and 
good, in the hostage crisis in Lebanon. The militant Shiite groups that this 
week announced the execution of one American hostage, Marine Lt. Col. William 
R. Higgins, and threatened the life of a second, Joseph J. Cicippio, are 
factions of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, nurtured by Khomeini's Iran since the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But national security analysts in Washington have told The Times that Iranian 
authorities also played a role in persuading the captors of Cicippio to suspend 
his execution. They said that key Hezbollah leaders were summoned to Syria on 
Thursday and told at a meeting at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus to spare the 
American's life. Hours later, Cicippio's captors said they were "freezing" 
plans for his execution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Arrogant U.S. Policy 
</P>
<P>
Although Rafsanjani's remarks indicated a willingness to talk with -- or even 
deal with -- the country still known in Iran as the "Great Satan," he sharply 
criticized what he called the arrogance of American policy in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"How stupid you are. . . ," he said of the government in Washington. "You have 
been to Lebanon once, and you saw how the Lebanese kicked you out." This was an 
apparent reference to the U.S. peacekeeping force that was withdrawn after a 
truck bomb was driven into a Marine barracks in October, 1983, killing 241 
American servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Now a civil war is "raining shells on Lebanon," he said. "What can your fleet 
do to top that? Is there any place in Lebanon not hit by a shell already?" 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president, faced with rebuilding an economy ravaged by an 
eight-year war with neighboring Iraq, appeared to straddle the fence of Middle 
East politics: opening the door a bit on the hostage crisis while firmly 
supporting Lebanese Shiites in their struggle against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said, "If the arrogant world is interested, the way to solve (this) 
is to tell Israel to release Sheik (Abdel Karim) Obeid," the abducted 
clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Washington) responds by saying that Obeid's abduction has nothing to do 
with us and that we cannot put pressure on Israel, this isn't acceptable to 
us," he concluded, indicating that the fate of Obeid may be tied to that of the 
14 Western hostages held in Lebanon, including eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani has repeatedly offered to help obtain the release of U.S. hostages 
in Lebanon if Washington helps free three Iranians believed by Tehran to be 
held by right-wing Lebanese militias. He did not mention this condition Friday, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
In suspending the execution Thursday night, Cicippio's captor, the 
Revolutionary Justice Organization, demanded the release of Obeid and a number 
of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held by the Israelis. The group's 
communique, delivered to news agencies in Beirut, did not specifically tie the 
release of Obeid to the threatened killing of Cicippio, however. The former 
acting comptroller of American University of Beirut has been held hostage for 
nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, another Hezbollah faction, the Organization of the Oppressed on 
Earth, announced it had hanged Higgins, who had been held captive for more than 
17 months. Its demand also had been the release of Obeid, whom the Israelis say 
was a key Hezbollah leader in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Cicippio's captors said they would give Red Cross representatives a list of the 
prisoners whom they want released along with Obeid. Red Cross officials in 
Beirut said Friday that they were prepared to transmit the lists to Israeli 
authorities but that they had received nothing yet. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, meanwhile, officials said they felt the current crisis was easing. 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed hope that the Muslim militants would 
provide specifics of their demands and consulted with other top Israeli 
officials on a response to the Revolutionary Justice Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Cicippio's captors demanded Obeid's freedom and that of other prisoners held by 
Israel but did not suggest a prisoner swap. The Israelis have a standing offer 
to exchange Obeid and a number of Lebanese prisoners for three Israeli soldiers 
held in Lebanon and the foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to prepare a list of prisoners," Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan 
Haber said. "We do too." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross or some other mediator apparently would handle the details, at 
least initially. In Beirut, a Hezbollah leader, Sheik Naim Qassem, told 
Associated Press that there had been no direct or indirect contacts with the 
Israelis.

SEVASTOPOL ROLLS OUT RED CARPET FOR U.S. SAILORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SEVASTOPOL, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Famed for its tenacity in two historic sieges, this Soviet port succumbed 
instantly Friday to the smiles and enthusiasm of 600 American sailors who 
arrived on the first U.S. warships ever to call here. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been like this all the time, it would have been magnificent," said 
retired blacksmith Yuri D. Vlasov who, with his daughter and granddaughter, was 
among thousands of Soviet citizens who waved, whistled and threw gifts to 
crewmen as the cruiser Thomas S. Gates and the frigate Kauffman were warped 
into their berths. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've seen real live Americans," said Sergei Basalayev, 
a vacationer from western Siberia who caught one of the white hats the 
Americans tossed into the excited crowd. "They're just like us, except maybe a 
little less inhibited." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Official Program 
</P>
<P>
The American ships arrived Friday on a five-day visit as part of an official 
Soviet-American military contacts program that began last year. Three Soviet 
warships called at Norfolk, Va., last month as part of the same program. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this is not the last visit," Soviet Vice Adm. Vitaly P. Larionov 
told his American counterpart, Vice Adm. R. Paul Ilg, as he boarded the Gates 
for the official welcome. "I hope our relations will improve with each day, and 
the commanders of our ships will lay their courses to each other's harbors in 
the name of good will." 
</P>
<P>
The Gates and a shore battery exchanged 21-gun salutes as the ships steamed 
into the busy harbor, headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, under the 
escort of two Soviet guided missile vessels. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Americans lined the rails of their ships in silence, under orders 
to remain at attention while Soviet personnel on nearby ships and the civilian 
crowds waved and cheered. Finally, as the Gates was tying up, the order came to 
stand down. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey guys!" one of the Americans shouted, "the word from the bridge is, if 
you're not busy, wave your hats." 
</P>
<P>
One American, followed by dozens of others, flung his hat into the appreciative 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Davai! Davai!" the Russians shouted. "Come on! Come on!" 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet teen-ager leaped from the pier into the murky water to retrieve 
several hats that had fallen short of the mark. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Soviets showered the ships with coins, souvenir lapel pins, 
cigarettes, candy and flowers. Women shouted at the Americans to buy ice cream 
with the money. 
</P>
<P>
As they disembarked for a few hours of liberty, the Americans were mobbed. They 
posed for photographs, signed autographs and traded souvenirs of a visit both 
sides are likely to remember for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had so many people pay so much attention to me before," said Steve 
Danskine of Roseburg, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans set out in twos and threes to explore the city, they found 
scores of willing young Soviet escorts, apparently eager to meet them and 
perhaps share the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first U.S. naval visit to any Soviet port since May, 1975, during 
a period of Soviet-American detente. That visit was to Leningrad, long an open 
city for foreign travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Sevastopol has been closed to foreigners, and since 1984, even 
Soviet citizens have needed special permission to visit here. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Adm. Ilg told a news conference that his ships had been propelled "by 
winds of change that are blowing through your country." 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Mikhail N. Khronopulo, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, agreed, saying 
that "it would have been hard to imagine this kind of situation even two years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Sevastopol, a pleasant city of about 400,000 people, is a natural harbor 
surrounded by hills. In the Crimean War of 1854-56 with England, France and 
Turkey, it fell after a siege of nearly a year. In World War II, it was 
captured by German troops after a siege of eight months. 
</P>
<P>
The American sailors said they had been given almost no special security 
instructions, and what instructions they were given appeared to bear this out. 
More space was devoted to warning them of the potential pitfalls of dealing 
with the media than in contacting Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
They were warned against black-market dealings and reminded that, even more 
than in other circumstances, they were representing the good name of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Robert Sutton, the Gates' commanding officer, reportedly told his men 
that "one of the worst things about American culture is 'boom boxes' (large 
portable radios)," and he ordered the men not to use them either on board ship 
or ashore. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warships are to be open to public tours for three hours a day starting 
today. Crewmen are to serve hot dogs and soft drinks to the thousands of Soviet 
guests expected. 
</P>
<P>
Some areas of the ships, including their command and control centers, would be 
off limits, according to U.S. officers. Ilg said in reply to a reporter's 
question that the ships would adhere to standing U.S. policy of neither 
confirming nor denying the presence or absence of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Americans' time ashore will be devoted to taking part, in organized 
groups, in activities planned by their Soviet hosts. These were to include 
visits to a local winery, a state farm, museum concerts and a youth camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans were loaded down with souvenirs to give to the Soviet people they 
meet, but within hours many had exhausted their supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to find a Russian sailor and trade him for his hat," said Charles 
Johnston, a communications specialist from Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The Sevastopol visit has special meaning for Command Master Chief Bobby Scott, 
the highest-ranking enlisted man on the Gates. Scott, a native of Memphis, will 
celebrate 37 years in the Navy today, and he intends to re-enlist for a final 
three years while here. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to do it in the Soviet Union is something to talk about," Scott 
said. "I've got seven grandchildren, and I want to see Russia, so I can tell 
them about it."

The Senate Ethics Committee announced Friday it began a second-stage 
investigation of Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) after finding he may have 
violated laws or Senate rules with a book-publishing contract and in soliciting 
appearances to avoid paying for personal travel. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the committee said it had hired Washington attorney Robert S. 
Bennett to conduct a "preliminary inquiry" into allegations against the 
Minnesota Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger, in a statement, said: "We are cooperating fully with the Ethics 
Committee on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "As a former member of this committee, I respect this process and want 
to see it work as efficiently and as quickly as possible. I am hopeful the 
committee can wrap this up quickly."

GINGRICH BLAMES 'ENRAGED' DEMOCRATS FOR ALLEGATIONS

Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) defended himself Friday against growing allegations 
of House rules violations, saying that the charges come from "enraged" 
Democrats led by "an almost irrational" Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, the House minority whip, told a television interviewer that Democrats 
have vowed revenge since he spurred the ethics case that led to the resignation 
of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are people who are enraged that I insisted on investigating Jim 
Wright, and I think, frankly, they will try to do virtually anything to try to 
prove that you can't stand up to that kind of power and get away with it," he 
said on ABC's "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander already has filed a complaint against Gingrich with the House Ethics 
Committee and said Thursday he is preparing to amend the charge to include as 
many as 200 additional rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich dismissed the threat Friday, saying: "I think in terms of the 
substance of the charges, what you have is an almost irrational Democrat in 
Bill Alexander who is wandering around wildly saying things. I'm comfortable 
that after the Ethics Committee has investigated it that they are going to say 
that there's nothing to the charges."

SEX PROBES TO TARGET 3 LAWMAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
REPS. BATES, LUKENS, SAVAGE FACE INQUIRIES BY ETHICS COMMITTEE

The House Ethics Committee announced Friday that it will conduct preliminary 
inquiries into allegations of sexual misconduct against three congressmen, Rep. 
Jim Bates (D-San Diego), Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens (R-Ohio) and Rep. Gus 
Savage (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Thursday at a closed meeting of the panel, which declined 
further comment on the three investigations. The 12-member committee acted 
after reviewing complaints that were filed against the lawmakers by former 
aides or other members of the House. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the House, a preliminary inquiry is the first step in 
investigating ethics cases involving a member of Congress. If the panel finds 
there is a "reason to believe" that a lawmaker has acted improperly, it can 
then decide to open a formal investigation, similar to a trial. Based on 
recommendations made by the panel, a lawmaker could face disciplinary action by 
the House, including expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, 48, was accused last year by two former aides of sexually harassing 
female members of his staff and forcing them to perform campaign-related tasks 
on office time. The aides said that Bates embraced them and engaged in other 
objectionable activity. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, the four-term congressman denied the allegations and 
said: "The complaint's almost a year old, so I'm looking forward to finally 
getting it cleared up. I don't feel the allegations are accurate. It's 
unfortunate that I've never been given a copy of the specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"That forces you to kind of go into this thing blind. How can you make a 
specific response if you don't know the specific complaint? I'd like to talk to 
whoever wrote these rules sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said that he intends "to cooperate fully with the committee" but that he 
was unsure whether he would respond through written or oral testimony. He said 
he has been told that the preliminary investigation may be completed by early 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really surprised the committee's going to look at it, given the 
climate in Washington these days," he said. "I'm just eager to get it behind 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Bates, who last year admitted to "kidding around and flirting" with female 
staffers in ways that he conceded were "sometimes inappropriate and 
unprofessional," reiterated Friday that he believes his conduct "never 
approached the level" of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The examples of alleged sexual harassment detailed in news stories last fall 
include charges that Bates requested daily hugs from female staffers, during 
which he often patted their buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, he allegedly asked one aide whether she would sleep with him 
if they were stranded on a desert island, and he allegedly embarrassed another 
female employee when, in full view of his office staff, he wrapped his legs 
around her extended leg and began to sway back and forth, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling today is what it was when this first came out -- that a lot of this 
was just joking around that got taken the wrong way or exaggerated," Bates said 
Friday. "I'm sorry it happened. But to call it sexual harassment . . . is 
blowing it way out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Lukens, 58, was convicted in Ohio on misdemeanor charges of contributing to the 
unruliness of a minor. On June 30 he was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 
fined $1,000. Although Lukens is appealing his sentence, the House Republican 
caucus filed the complaint, based on charges that he had sex with the 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Through a press spokesman, Lukens on Friday denied any wrongdoing and said he 
welcomed the opportunity to provide additional information about the 
teen-ager's credibility that had been ruled inadmissible during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
In the Savage case, three House Democrats filed a complaint against the 
Illinois Democrat last month after a Peace Corps volunteer said he fondled her 
while he was traveling on congressional business in Zaire last March. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, the woman said she accompanied Savage and other 
individuals on a tour of area nightclubs after a dinner at the U.S. 
ambassador's residence. As she sat in the back of a limousine, the congressman 
fondled her repeatedly and demanded that she have sex with him, despite her 
strong protests, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also is expected to look into allegations that Savage, during a 1986 
congressional trip to China, canceled a series of business meetings and 
traveled instead to South Korea and Hong Kong for sightseeing and to shop for 
tailored suits. Savage, 63, was unavailable for comment Friday, but he has 
angrily denied the Peace Corps worker's charges and told reporters two weeks 
ago: "I did nothing, that's what I did. This lie was leaked by the State 
Department for political reasons."

Most Venezuelans doubt that authorities will find those guilty of stealing 
billions of dollars in a government corruption scandal, according to a poll 
published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The survey said 59% of 1,000 respondents nationwide believe a judicial probe 
will fail to uncover the people responsible for cheating a now-defunct 
government department set up in 1983 to sell dollars to Venezuelan importers at 
a discount. Many think cover-ups are hindering the investigation.

An estimated $30 billion passed through the Office of Differential Exchange 
Rate Controls -- known by its Spanish acronym Recadi -- and up to $8 billion of 
it has not been accounted for, according to government sources.

Schools and universities closed down in Panama on Friday for at least three 
days after the death of a student in a clash with Panamanian riot police.

<P>
The Education Ministry said public and private schools will be closed until 
further notice, and classes were suspended at universities for three days. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old student died of gunshot wounds in the chest Thursday when riot 
police charged dozens of demonstrators protesting against calls for new 
elections.

Opposition leaders, citing a stalemate in talks with the government on Panama's 
three-month-old political crisis, called Friday for a national referendum to 
let voters decide how to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government announced it had closed schools in three 
cities in the wake of Thursday's fatal shooting of a 24-year-old student during 
an anti-government protest at the University of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, members of Panama's Defense Forces opened fire on the 
student demonstrators, killing Luis Gonzales and wounding at least six others. 
</P>
<P>
The students were protesting an Organization of American States proposal to end 
Panama's political turmoil by holding a plebiscite Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The students and opposition parties insist that elections May 7, which their 
candidate Guillermo Endara won overwhelmingly, should be declared valid. The 
government of Manuel A. Noriega annulled the vote, claiming fraud. 
</P>
<P>
An Education Ministry statement said public and private schools were being 
closed nationwide "until further notice . . . for the safety of students, to 
preserve the peace of mind of their families and peace throughout the community 
in general." 
</P>
<P>
University officials in a statement Friday accused the Defense Forces of acting 
"brutally against unarmed students."

Winding up the first session of the Soviet Union's new Parliament, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday criticized a fledgling opposition 
group and called for action to combat the country's rising crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader told the 542-member Supreme Soviet that its first 40-day 
session had coincided with a particularly difficult period for his perestroika 
reform effort. But he denied that there was any reason for panic, saying that 
recent events had shown that problems should be settled through "dialogue 
between the authorities and working people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wave of Violence 
</P>
<P>
"The country has not had a single calm day throughout the past 1 1/2 months," 
Gorbachev declared, referring to ethnic violence in many parts of the country 
followed by miners' strikes in western Siberia and the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, which was elected by the 2,250-member Congress of People's 
Deputies to operate as a legislature, has been learning during its inaugural 
session how to flex its political muscle. Over the past few weeks, deputies 
have rejected nine candidates for ministerial office, overruled the Defense 
Ministry on exempting students from military service and passed a spate of 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who called for new political institutions as a way of giving impetus 
to his economic reforms, also expressed satisfaction with the results of the 
first parliamentary session. But he acknowledged that the body suffered from 
poor organization, too much talk, and a lack of "political culture." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader also criticized radical and progressive deputies who have 
formed a parliamentary faction known as the Inter-Regional Deputies' Group in 
order to push for faster reform. He condemned what he called "provocative 
appeals" made at mass meetings by some members of the group, which includes 
former Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N. Yeltsin and human rights 
campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov. 
</P>
<P>
At Gorbachev's urging, the Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled to resume in late 
September, passed a resolution calling for "extraordinary measures in the 
critical battle against crime," including an unspecified increase in the 
Interior Ministry's 300,000 troops.

India on Friday offered to withdraw 1,500 troops a week if the largest Tamil 
guerrilla group observes a cease-fire, government sources here said. 
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to enforce a July, 1987, peace 
accord aimed at ending ethnic strife in the Indian Ocean republic, where the 
government is dominated by the Sinhalese majority. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry sources said the Indian offer came Friday before 
the two sides ended a weeklong talk in New Delhi aimed at finding ways to make 
India withdraw its troops. Indian government officials in New Delhi were not 
available for comment on the proposal. India has said that a hasty withdrawal 
could cause even more bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sri Lankan police said a strike called Friday by Sinhalese 
radicals to protest 150 deaths during protests last week disrupted normal life 
in the island nation but reported no incidents of violence.

DON'T LET RACE FORCE SPLIT, BLACK CATHOLICS ARE URGED

<P>
Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York urged black Roman Catholics on Friday not 
to let racial differences force them from the church, saying separatist leaders 
are straying from its message of inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"The church cannot be exclusive, whether it's exclusively white, exclusively 
black, exclusively yellow," O'Connor said. "We are all one in the body of 
Christ." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor spoke to about 250 people attending a four-day conference of black 
Catholics, where a primary topic is expected to be the splinter congregation 
formed recently by a black Washington priest who mixes Roman Catholic liturgy 
with African and black American religious traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Of the priest, the Rev. George Stallings, O'Connor would say only that he is 
"praying for everybody involved" and is leaving Stallings' fate up to local 
church authorities. The church has suspended him from performing sanctioned 
Masses and other sacraments but has not moved to excommunicate him. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he did not foresee a mass defection by black Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, whose theme is "Creating a Spirit of African-American 
Leadership," centers on ways to eliminate racism in the church and bring more 
blacks into top church positions. 
</P>
<P>
One such black, Archbishop Eugene Marino of Atlanta, said he was saddened at 
the schism highlighted by Stallings' break, but he pointed to himself as 
evidence that blacks can attain power within the hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of us intend to stay in the church and bring about change, and a 
lessening of racism," said Marino, the first black archbishop in the United 
States. But Marino said Stallings might accomplish some good with his boldness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has shown the leadership of the church that there are these 
concerns," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
Some black Catholics have called for a new rite centering on African and black 
American religious traditions, but Marino said that would only distance blacks 
from a worldwide Catholic mainstream that has held Mass in essentially the same 
manner for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Stallings' church, the Imani Temple, said Thursday the priest 
had no plans to attend the conference, held by the National Office for Black 
Catholics and the National Black Lay Catholic Conference. The groups represent 
more than 1 million black Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor stressed that leaders of black Catholics or of any other ethnic group 
must not try to teach their own version of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
The cardinal admitted that church leadership could do more to expunge racism 
from its congregations.

MEASLES ON RISE NATIONWIDE; CHICAGO WORST HIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sound trucks are moving through the streets of some of Chicago's poorest 
neighborhoods nightly warning parents that their children are being threatened 
by a potential killer -- measles. 
</P>
<P>
In public housing projects, a small army of nurses go door-to-door every day 
offering free immunizations against the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's health commissioner asked clergymen to warn their congregations of 
the spreading disease and to urge them to inoculate their children. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings are also being broadcast on English- and Spanish-language radio and 
television stations and are being distributed in 150,000 leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest mobilization to combat a public health problem here in at 
least a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worst Since 1980 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more cases of measles have been reported this year than in any year 
since 1980, according to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
Currently the worst outbreak of the disease is centered in metropolitan 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
So far more than 800 cases of measles, most of them among preschool children, 
have been confirmed here. More than 1,000 cases have been documented in the 
entire metropolitan area, according to health officials and four deaths, two of 
them in the city, have been blamed on measles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything under the sun to stop it," said Richard Krieg, 
Chicago's acting health commissioner. "We have taken extraordinary measures." 
</P>
<P>
"Once an outbreak gets started it's hard to control," said Fred Wilt, 
administrator of the Houston Public Health Department's immunization program. 
"It's like a fire. It will go whichever way the wind blows." 
</P>
<P>
The disease, a communicable virus, is characterized primarily by small red 
spots on the skin. It occurs most frequently in children. 
</P>
<P>
Houston and the state of California, along with Chicago, account for almost 
half of the cases recorded this year by federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Among Chicago's extraordinary measures are easy-to-get, free vaccinations. 
Seven centers have been opened to give shots and booths are being set up at 
some weekend neighborhood festivals. Vaccine has been sent to 75 private health 
and community service facilities with the understanding they will not charge 
for shots. Off-duty nurses have been stationed in hospital emergency rooms to 
provide inoculations. 
</P>
<P>
All Chicago police and firemen have been offered vaccine and all emergency room 
physicians have been ordered by the health department to be immunized. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago health officials are concentrating their education and inoculation 
campaign in low income black and Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to see lower immunization rates among people that are economically 
deprived in the inner city," said Jim Mize, a public health adviser with the 
Centers for Disease Control. "Vaccination rates are often less among those 
groups than among suburbanites." 
</P>
<P>
Since the first of the year 90 outbreaks have been recorded in 36 states. At 
least 20 deaths nationwide have been blamed on the disease this year. So far 
the Centers for Disease Control has logged 8,227 cases nationwide, a 371% 
increase over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago health officials have traced the outbreak to Bradley University in 
Peoria where several students came down with the disease just before their 
Easter break. Students returning to Chicago homes for the holiday vacation were 
believed to have brought the measles with them, Krieg said. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, the scene of the nation's other major outbreak this year, 1,286 
cases were have been reported since last October. However in July there were 
only 16 new cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much on the downhill side and have been that way since April," 
said Houston's Wilt. 
</P>
<P>
In California there have been 1,848 cases of measles so far this year according 
to the Centers for Disease Control. A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Health 
Services said that through July 1 there were 664 reported measles cases of 
which 405 have been confirmed. "It's near epidemic," she said.

President Bush announced Friday he is forming a seven-member commission to 
investigate air terrorism, with particular emphasis on the bombing last 
December of Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in an executive order, said the Commission on Aviation Security and 
Terrorism will study the adequacy of security procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission also shall review options for handling terrorist acts involving 
aviation," Bush's order said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will be composed of seven members appointed by the President -- 
including two senators and two members of the House. The chairman of the group 
is to be picked by the President from among the members. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also will study the issue of public notification of bomb threats, the 
order said. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement that 
"ongoing, intensive investigations into all aspects of the destruction of Pan 
Am Flight 103 will not be affected by the commission's work. Rather, the 
commission will focus on the need for additional measures to improve aviation 
security." 
</P>
<P>
The move was applauded by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) who had worked with Bush in forming the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
"Every American has grieved for the victims of Flight 103 and shared the grief 
of their families. Although the headlines of the tragedy have faded, questions 
still linger," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"They involve basic factual questions such as what kind of aviation security 
measures may be necessary under what conditions? What kind of warnings should 
be given to the traveling public? Where, exactly, responsibility should lie 
between airports, airlines, the federal government and foreign governments in 
seeking to protect the security of Americans traveling abroad," Mitchell's 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole called Bush's move "a good initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Flight 103, a Boeing 747, exploded above Lockerbie, Scotland, when a bomb went 
off on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.

Three people who chained themselves to a cage at Marion County's Humane Society 
for 3 1/2 hours to protest an order to kill their dog for biting a pedestrian 
won at least a temporary reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
The dog, a small black dachshund-terrier mix named Blue Two, will not be put to 
death before Monday, the Humane Society said Thursday. That would give the 
protesters time to appeal in Marion County Circuit Court. 
</P>

State law requires that a dog be put to death if it is found to have bitten and 
injured or killed a person without provocation.

Former House Speaker Jim Wright was spending almost $100,000 a month on lawyers 
to defend himself against ethics charges that consumed his final three months 
in office, his campaign finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's campaign finance reports, filed this week with the Federal Election 
Commission, show that from March until May, he spent $282,000 to pay his 
lawyers from Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Evans, a Washington firm. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Wright paid $78,734 to the firm, his records show. That would bring 
the total to $360,734 from October through May. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Wright announced in May that he would abandon his defense and 
resign, his supporters launched a fund-raising effort to cover legal bills said 
at the time to be approaching $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The supporters, who included Reps. Charles Wilson, J. J. Pickle, Jack Brooks 
and Martin Frost, all Democrats from Texas, helped organize a fund-raising 
event in Austin to finance Wright's legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
That money was to be placed in a legal defense fund, which would have had to 
disclose its finances next year if Wright had stayed in office. However, under 
House rules, his departure means that no such public disclosure of the fund is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not return telephone calls Friday to discuss the fund. 
</P>
<P>
He relinquished the Speaker's gavel and left the House in June.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly said here Friday 
that Exxon should not abandon its efforts to clean up the nation's largest oil 
spill until the job is done. 
</P>
<P>
In the most forceful language he has yet employed, Reilly said that despite 
Exxon's claims that the cleanup will be completed by Sept. 15 it was "quite 
clear this job is not going to be done this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, in response to a question, said Exxon should be held to its original 
pledge not to quit until the cleanup was complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Exxon ought to be here next year. I'll say that right now," Reilly 
said as he stepped off a float plane onto one of the most heavily oiled islands 
in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Take It Step by Step' 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly not the task of one summer and probably even not a couple of 
years. But we'll take it step by step," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Reilly said that Exxon's response so far to the nation's largest 
oil spill has been "positive" and that "we expect them to continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Reilly's remarks come at a time of lingering confusion over Exxon's future 
cleanup plans, and on the same day that the U.S. Coast Guard reported that 
1,355 miles of Alaskan shoreline -- nearly twice the earlier estimate -- had 
been affected by the March 24 oil spill of 11 million gallons from the tanker 
Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Friday, Otto Harrison, general manager of Exxon's cleanup 
effort, told a hearing in Anchorage that the company would make no commitments 
to fund more oil removal efforts next year, according to a United Press 
International report. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has came under fire in Congress and from Alaskan officials after the 
disclosure of a July 19 company memo written by Harrison that said there were 
no guarantees the cleanup would be resumed next spring after winter storms 
subside. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in testimony before a Senate committee, Exxon President William D. 
Stevens appeared to retreat from that position, calling the memo's wording 
unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said the company would comply with any "reasonable" request from the 
U.S. Coast Guard, which is overseeing the federal government's response to the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many viewed the testimony as giving the oil company breathing room 
not to return. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon also issued a statement July 28 quoting from a statement by Lawrence G. 
Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp., at Exxon's May 18 annual shareholders meeting: 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to complete the job by mid-September, and milestones have 
been established to measure our progress. In any event, we will return to the 
area in the spring of 1990 to reinspect the area, to assure that the job has 
been properly done, and if not, to put it right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toll of Beaches 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said Friday that less than a third of the 1,355 miles of 
beaches have been treated by Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon reported late last month that it would spend $1.28 billion on the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Exxon's decision to quit for the winter because of adverse weather 
conditions came under fire again from Alaska officials. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Environmental Commissioner Dennis Kelso, in testimony before the Alaska 
Oil Spill Commission meeting in Anchorage, said the decision called into 
question the industry's ability to deal with a spill during winter. 
</P>
<P>
"If it really is Exxon's position that an effective response cannot be safely 
maintained during the winter months, then what does that say about the 
transport of oil in Prince William Sound or in other parts of the Alaskan 
environment during those same months?" Kelso asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visits Two Islands 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Reilly, in his first inspection of Prince William 
Sound since the cleanup mobilization, visited Knight and Green islands, which 
were among the hardest hit by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said that he was encouraged by the cleanup progress and by preliminary 
results which show that applying fertilizers on the oiled beaches accelerates 
the breakdown of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly declined, however, to comment at length on a controversial proposal to 
use a chemical dispersant on or near beaches to break up the oil. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, eight environmental organizations urged Reilly to forbid the use 
of the dispersant, known as Corexit 9580, because of its potential toxicity to 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it seriously," Reilly said. He said toxicological tests would be 
completed by Aug. 10. "There's time for a decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly also met with Exxon officials here, as well as local, state and federal 
officials. Later, he was scheduled to fly to Cordova, a fishing community hard 
hit by the loss of the salmon season. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, who is scheduled to fly Sunday to Mexico City for preparations for the 
summit between the U.S. and Mexico, said he will report his Alaskan findings to 
President Bush.

ARCO CONFIRMS MAJOR NEW OIL FIND NEAR PRUDHOE BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. said Friday that test wells on the North Slope of Alaska 
have confirmed the existence of another major oil field there, which the 
company called one of the largest domestic finds in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Arco estimated that the find in Alaska's Point McIntyre field had recoverable 
reserves of about 300 million barrels of oil -- enough to add five months of 
production from Alaska at current rates of about 2 million barrels per day, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The find is especially important to California, which relies on Alaskan oil for 
about 40% of its supply. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms that there are still a few major fields to be found in the 
frontier areas of the United States," said Harry Quarls, an analyst with Booz, 
Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said the field was an important find but would not significantly 
diminish the country's increasing reliance on foreign oil. "It's nice, but it 
doesn't fundamentally change your energy balance," said James Sweeney, a 
professor at Stanford University specializing in energy economics and policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impetus for Exploration 
</P>
<P>
The Arco find adds impetus to increase exploration for oil in Alaska to replace 
rapidly dwindling reserves, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials believe much more oil remains to be placed into production 
in Alaska and have been pushing to open drilling in the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge, under which government officials estimate there may be as much 
as 9.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. 
</P>
<P>
But it also raised the concerns of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unwise at this point to start producing from new fields in Alaska until 
we have at a minimum absorbed the lessons of Exxon Valdez, which we have not 
even begun to do in terms of tanker safety," said James Thornton, a lawyer with 
the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Three hundred million barrels of oil is a reasonable amount of oil, but it's 
trivial compared to the amount that could be saved through energy conservation, 
particularly through energy efficient automobiles," Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparable Fields 
</P>
<P>
The Arco field compares with the last major find in Alaska, the Endicott Field 
in 1978, which had about 350 million barrels of recoverable reserves, said 
Susan Andrews, an Arco spokeswoman in Alaska. The last major discovery in the 
Lower 48 states was the Point Pedernales Field off the shores of Lompoc, 
Calif., in 1982, which had reserves of about 343 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
The new oil field was confirmed by a test well that resulted in a rate of flow 
as high as 5,400 barrels a day, Arco said. 
</P>
<P>
The well was the third drilled into the field and was about 2 1/2 miles east of 
the first well, which was drilled in 1988 and yielded a flow rate of 2,500 
barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
A second well showed rates as high as 5,350 barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
"With testing completed on these two delineation wells, we have confirmed the 
presence of a high quality reservoir with good porosity and permeability," said 
Jerry Dees, vice president of exploration for Arco Alaska Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slower Production Rate 
</P>
<P>
Many single wells in Alaska produce about 2,500 barrels a day, but the average 
well in the United States currently yields about 13.5 barrels a day because 
many of the fields in Texas and other states are mature. 
</P>
<P>
The field is two miles from Prudhoe Bay. Arco shares as much as a 40% interest 
in it with Exxon Corp. and BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., a unit of British 
Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
Arco will drill more test wells to further define the field. Production would 
not begin at the field until at least the mid-1990s, said Arco spokesman Al 
Greenstein in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the amount of recoverable reserves from current Alaska fields 
vary. But officials estimate that the remaining recoverable reserves from the 
current Prudhoe Bay field at about 5 billion barrels and from the nearby 
Kuparuk field about 1.6 billion to 2 billion barrels, down from about 10 
billion to 12 billion at the beginning of production. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews estimated that there was at least 20 years of production remaining from 
Prudhoe Bay. "While it has reached its peak, there are still many years of 
production left." 
</P>
<P>
Another 15 billion to 20 billion barrels may lie in the so-called West Sak 
field, but the amount of recoverable oil may be far less because of the 
difficulty of extracting it.

DEPUTIES SEARCH FOR MISSING TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies appealed to the public Friday to help find a missing 
17-year-old San Bernardino youth who has the mental and emotional development 
of an 11-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Erick Scott Appel has been missing since July 12. Investigators said he is 
schizophrenic and may experience hallucinations without medication. 
</P>
<P>
"Erick is extremely trusting, vulnerable and susceptible. He is like a 10- or 
11-year-old kid in a lot of ways," said Vince Appel, the youth's father. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Appel, his stepmother, said the teen-ager looks and speaks normally but 
tells fanciful, farfetched stories. He blinks his eyes hard when nervous, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth is 6 feet, 1 inch tall, weighs approximately 130 pounds and has blue 
eyes and brown hair in a crew cut. He was last seen riding his purple and white 
BMX bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino Sheriff's Detective David Heard said investigators do not 
believe the missing teen-ager ran away.

2 WILDFIRES BURNING OUT OF CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO COUNTY BLAZE FORCES CLOSURE OF OBSERVATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An 11,000-acre wildfire continued to rage out of control in San Diego County 
Friday night and firefighters in Los Angeles County responded to a new blaze 
that had threatened homes in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The fire near Mt. Palomar in San Diego County was reported 60% contained, but 
U.S. Forest Service officials said temperatures in the 90s, low humidity, heavy 
brush and the steep terrain of the Cleveland National Forest were hampering the 
efforts of nearly 2,000 Forest Service, state Division of Forestry and military 
firefighters to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Few fire roads penetrate the mountainous area where the fire has burned for a 
week, and fire crews had to be airlifted by helicopter or march in on foot to 
reach some of the hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 of the firefighters were deployed around homes and the observatory 
atop Mt. Palomar, where astronomers closed the big dome last Saturday to 
protect the 200-inch mirror of one of the world's largest telescopes from 
drifting ash. On Thursday, the rest of the complex was closed. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service Capt. Jim Van Meter said the deployment at Mt. Palomar was 
largely precautionary. The flames were at one point about two miles away but 
turned in another direction late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to panic people, because there's no reason to panic," Van Meter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred visitors were evacuated from camps on the flanks of the 
mountain, but officials said none of the camp structures appeared to be in 
immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, a fast-moving blaze burned at least 500 acres and for 
several hours threatened about 400 homes in the community of Green Valley, 
about 50 miles north of Los Angeles in the Angeles National Forest. At one 
point, flames burned to within 100 yards of some of the homes before being 
beaten back. 
</P>
<P>
About 350 county firefighters and 100 Forest Service personnel were moved in to 
battle the fire, which broke out at about 11:15 a.m. near San Francisquito 
Canyon Road, about a mile south of town. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Soto, a county fire investigator, said the fire was about 50% contained by 
nightfall and appeared to be burning away from the community.

JOHN OGDON, 52; CONCERT PIANIST AND COMPOSER

<P>
John Ogdon, a concert pianist and composer known for his work on behalf of 
modern music who had been making a comeback after suffering a mental breakdown, 
died Tuesday at age 52, his agents said. 
</P>
<P>
Manygate Management said Ogdon died peacefully after going into a coma after 
his admission to London's Charing Cross Hospital on Monday for 
bronchopneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Before the time in the late 1960s that the schizophrenia that ran in his family 
sharply limited his career, Ogdon had developed a vast repertoire of classic 
and modern music and composed chamber music, a symphony and a piano concerto. 
</P>
<P>
A golden future seemed assured when, at 25, Ogdon shared top place with Soviet 
pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy in the piano section of the 1962 Moscow Tchaikovsky 
International Competition for young musicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acclaimed by Audience 
</P>
<P>
After Ogdon played the Liszt No. 1 Piano Concerto and the Tchaikovsky No. 1 
Piano Concerto, the audience rose and demanded that he be awarded first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Ogdon and Ashkenazy became friends. In 1966, Ashkenazy performed a new work by 
Ogdon at the Cheltenham Festival in England. Ogdon toured the Soviet Union 
several times and traveled throughout Europe, the United States, Canada and the 
Far East. 
</P>
<P>
After his breakdown, Ogdon's hair turned white, he became obese and he spent 
time in a mental hospital. This year the British Broadcasting Corp. presented a 
television program called "Virtuoso," describing his crippling bouts of mental 
illness. It was based on a book his wife had written about her husband's 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
But Ogdon began a comeback in 1981, and in the last 12 months he recorded the 
complete piano works of Sergei Rachmaninoff, several albums of popular piano 
pieces and Kaikhosru Sorabji's "Opus Clavcicembalisticum."

BRADSHAW'S BITTER FEELINGS TOWARD STEELERS RUN DEEP 
</P>

<P>
Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremonies have become a love feast for Pittsburgh 
Steelers fans who have seen members of their cherished Super Bowl teams 
enshrined for the last three years. But sadness and tension will be felt here 
today, when quarterback Terry Bradshaw takes his place beside defensive tackle 
Joe Greene and linebacker Jack Ham. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw ended his stormy, 14-year career on a bitter note. And he has had 
virtually no contact with former teammates, Coach Chuck Noll or team owner Dan 
Rooney since a controversial elbow injury ended his career in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that the critical remarks Bradshaw, now a CBS announcer, made on the air 
about Noll last season -- calling him a "jerk" and suggesting the game had 
passed him by. 
</P>
<P>
The thousands of Steelers fans who made the three-hour drive to these 
ceremonies may not know whether to embrace or boo their prodigal quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Terry felt betrayed and rejected by the Steelers," said former center 
Ray Mansfield. 
</P>
<P>
Though Bradshaw and Noll -- and in fact Bradshaw and the Steelers fans -- often 
wrangled over his play and his public statements, the falling out became 
complete when surgery the team did not authorize failed to repair Bradshaw's 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt like he had really done something for them, and they had turned their 
backs on him," said Mansfield. "He ended up walking away bitter." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw has language in his contract as an analyst for CBS that states he is 
not required to do Steelers games. 
</P>
<P>
The wounds are so deep that Rooney's telephone calls to Bradshaw to 
congratulate him on his selection to the Hall of Fame went unreturned. 
</P>
<P>
And Bradshaw has acknowledged that Noll did not call him, either. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't care," Bradshaw told USA Today. "He did not respond to interview 
requests from a Pittsburgh paper. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all right. I couldn't handle it if he did call. It would be too 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, if someone locked us in a room, I really think we could settle 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw has hinted his Hall of Fame speech, and his upcoming book, "Looking 
Deep," makes some effort at reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time to select a presenter for the ceremonies, he chose 
broadcast partner Verne Lundquist instead of anyone from his playing career. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw has said that had Steelers founder Art Rooney not died a year ago, he 
would have asked the elder Rooney to do the honors. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mr. Rooney died, that was Terry's last tie to the Steelers," said 
Bradshaw's wife, Charla. He did not attend The Chief's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"When Terry is finished with anything, he puts it behind him," said his wife. 
The two live in Roanoke, Tex., with daughters Rachel, 2, and Erin, five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, too, acknowledged he has no wish to relive the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't that close to any of my teammates. I didn't find anyone to become a 
best friend. We don't stay in touch. They're all over the country, but I do not 
want to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're around, I love it," said Bradshaw, who shares enshrinement honors 
with former teammate Mel Blount, one-time Green Bay Packers defensive back 
Willie Wood and Oakland Raiders lineman Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"But once you're through with something, bury it and move on to something else. 
You can't live in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those words must be lost on Steelers fans, who are here today to do just that.

As quickly as France's Nathalie Tauziat turned the match over to Robin White of 
Del Mar on a double fault, it came bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not actually bouncing. It was more like flying past her on a double fault 
on match point that landed beyond the service line. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Tauziat went on to win the third-set tie-breaker and defeat White, 
4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (10-8), Friday in the quarterfinals of the Great American Bank 
tennis tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Tauziat into the semifinals tonight at 6:30 against No. 2 
Zina Garrison of Houston. Garrison eliminated the last San Diego player in the 
field, Gretchen Magers, 6-4, 7-5, in a quarterfinal Friday night in front of 
3,784.

Top-ranked Steffi Graf will play in the afternoon semifinal today at 12:30 
against compatriot Bettina Bunge of West Germany. Bunge, coming back from knee 
and foot surgery in her first singles competition since November 1987, defeated 
last year's finalist, Ann Grossman, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4, in an afternoon 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Tauziat was another frustrating end for White, who has dropped six 
of her seven three-set matches this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be disappointed in the way I played, only in the outcome," White said. 
"I played the way I wanted to. I went for it, especially at the end. I didn't 
play safe by any means." 
</P>
<P>
That was no truer than on her failed match point. 
</P>
<P>
Tauziat, ranked 26th in the world, gave White the chance to serve for the match 
when she double-faulted with the decisive tie-breaker tied at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
White was one point away from the semifinals, but she let it slip away with a 
hurried double-fault that evened it at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have taken 15 extra seconds and really thought about it," White said. 
"At that point, you just get your serve in. I don't care how you get it in, you 
get your serve in, and I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The mistake gave Tauziat another chance. She forced White to hold off two match 
points before advancing when White's return of service carried two inches long 
to give Tauziat the tie-breaker, 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
"I double-faulted at a very bad moment," Tauziat said. "But I was really tired 
at the end of the match. In this tie-breaker, it is 50-50. If you win, you are 
lucky, and that is it. You need a chance sometimes, and today I had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"She made a big double-fault, and after that, she was upset about it. You could 
see after that she was finished." 
</P>
<P>
White entered the tournament having lost eight of her 11 matches this year, 
dropping her ranking to No. 76, its lowest since she cracked the top 100 in 
early 1985 on her way to No. 15 two years later. 
</P>
<P>
The streak, she said, caused her to flirt with idea of retirement at age 25 
after five years on the tour. The frustration built to a point that she 
threatened to tip an umpire out of the chair during a tournament in Newport, 
R.I., two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
White said it took a recent visit to her parent's home in San Jose to renew her 
spirits. The result was her first quarterfinal appearance in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to retire; you say those things when things are going bad," 
White said. "I had a nice visit with my family. They told me 'Don't worry about 
the past few months. Just go out and play and have fun.' It was nice to get a 
little encouragement like that." 
</P>
<P>
Magers enjoyed a different kind of hometown cheer. Unlike her second-round 
victory the night before, when she found herself playing the heavy to 
15-year-old crowd darling Angelica Gavaldon of Coronado, Magers had much of her 
adopted hometown behind her in the match against Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
Magers, who moved to San Diego from San Antonio, Tex., last year, did her best 
to reward them. She battled Garrison, the sixth-ranked player in the world, to 
the end. But both sets ended with Garrison breaking Magers. 
</P>
<P>
Magers was on the verge of sending the match to a third set when she won three 
consecutive games to tie the second set at 5-5 and then had Garrison down three 
break points in the next game. But Garrison served five consecutive points to 
win the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just waiting for her to make a mistake," Magers said. "I hit all her 
returns back, but I just hit them low at her feet. I didn't do anything with 
the second shot. She came up with some good deep volleys. That just shows her 
experience, and why she is No. 6, and I am No. (36)." 
</P>
<P>
The final game ended after Magers fought off two match points from love-40 
before Garrison forced her to hit a backhand into the net at 30-40. 
</P>
<P>
"Zina just hit a couple of really good shots at perfect times," Magers said. 
"The score was good, and it was close, but I was disappointed that I did not 
take advantage of the opportunities she gave me. Unbelievable opportunities. 
But I didn't make the right shot at the right time."

A SWING IN MOMENTUM; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER OPENING THE YEAR IN A SLUMP, RYAN MCGUIRE REDISCOVERED HIS BATTING STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ryan McGuire's baseball cap looks like it has been tied to the trailer hitch of 
a pickup truck and dragged across the Bonneville Salt Flats. It is so peppered 
with salt that brine shrimp could live in it for weeks. It is so petrified from 
sweat that the Woodland Hills West first baseman probably doesn't need a 
batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the American Legion level, though, ballplayers are a superstitious lot. 
And since McGuire is batting .416 with five homers and 30 runs batted in and 
his team is in the state playoffs, which open today in Yountville, he'd 
probably go three weeks without a bath if it meant a few more hits. 
</P>
<P>
"This hat's working pretty good right now," McGuire said in reference to its 
less-than-decorous appearance. "And I don't want to change that." 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, he does change it. When practicing, McGuire wears a brand-new 
team cap. Its colors are still royal blue and white, a definite change from his 
game chapeau, which is a royal mess. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, McGuire's hat couture would have received little attention. But 
after the way his junior season at El Camino Real High began, McGuire probably 
washed everything he owned after each at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, McGuire rolled up the kind of accolades that, for most players, 
would have made an expand-o-matic headband almost mandatory. After batting .397 
McGuire, a 6-foot-2, 190-pound left-hander, was selected to the All-City 
Section 4-A Division team and named the state's sophomore player of the year by 
Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
The college recruiting letters poured in and the attention was magnified. At 
age 16, McGuire was more popular than white-out at City Hall. As a warm-up for 
his junior year, certain to be an improvement over the 1988 season, McGuire 
batted .444 with 22 RBIs while playing for West last summer. This kid was 
hotter than a Rob Lowe home video. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire and El Camino Real, however, took a collective header last spring. 
McGuire started with a one-for-15 skein and the team stumbled to a 1-7 record. 
For the first time since he began playing baseball as a 9-year-old, McGuire 
found himself wondering what had gone wrong. This season, it seemed, reaching 
for the stars left his head in the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to hit well over .400 and do a bunch of other things offensively," he 
said. "Setting my expectations so high, as soon as I started playing poorly, I 
started cussing myself and it snowballed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pressing and wasn't getting the pitches I wanted to hit. And since we 
weren't winning, I was pressing to try to win games." 
</P>
<P>
Got that? No impressing, just depressing. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole team was hurtin' and we weren't playing good ball," he said. "It was 
the worst time of my life. It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
A one-for-15 skid may not seem that terrible, but at the high school level, 
where a season consists of approximately 60 at-bats, it can leave a guy hurtin' 
for certain. McGuire, for instance, finished at .294 (15 for 51) after hitting 
.389 in his final 36 at-bats. Had he managed one more base hit, just one little 
flare here or there, he would have finished at .314. Almost as bad as the slump 
was the advice with which he was inundated. Virtually everyone he came in 
contact with had suggestions on how to end the drought. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone and their mother said something," he said. "Anyone that had ever seen 
baseball on TV had something to say." 
</P>
<P>
Later on, McGuire picked up the pace, batting .417 over the final weeks, but he 
finished with just nine RBIs. So, after being tabbed as one of the best 
prospects in Southern California, he wasn't even among the best on his team: 
six El Camino Real regulars had higher averages and four drove in more runs. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire fared better as a starting pitcher -- he was 4-2 with a 3.60 earned-run 
average -- but that may have further diluted his concentration. This summer, he 
has pitched in four of West's 30 games, all in short relief. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up as a junior and I think he felt he had to take the whole team into 
his own hands," said West outfielder Jason Cohen, who has played alongside 
McGuire for the past two seasons at El Camino Real. "He felt it was his full 
responsibility to carry us. He thought he had to hit .500, that he was expected 
to be All-City and throw a no-hitter every game. The pressure built up to where 
it really affected his hitting." 
</P>
<P>
After their 1-7 start, the Conquistadores won eight games in a row -- including 
a pair of wins over highly regarded San Fernando -- and advanced to the 
playoffs where they lost in the first round to Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the late-season run left McGuire and his teammates, many of whom also play 
for Woodland Hills West, eager to begin Legion ball. There were some 
misconceptions that needed to be straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of confidence going into American Legion," McGuire said. "We had 
won at the end of the season and now was a chance to start over and show that 
we could have done better -- should have done better -- than our record 
showed." 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West (27-3), which plays Fullerton in a first-round game this 
morning at 9:30, has won 11 games in a row and 21 of its past 22. To be sure, 
McGuire's rebirth at the plate has been a key in the winning streak. That's a 
key, not the key. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guys who are hitting about what Ryan is hitting, and one's 
hitting better than Ryan," Woodland Hills West Coach Gary Gibson said. "If he 
oh-fers on the day, some other kid picks up the slack. It does take a lot of 
pressure off him." 
</P>
<P>
Winning tends to boost the confidence level as well. El Camino Real's combined 
record for the past two seasons is 17-19. Woodland Hills West, only the second 
District 20 team since 1976 to advance to the state playoffs, is 49-7 over the 
same span. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we ever won anything," McGuire said. "Most of us are 
ecstatic. Right now, we know we're going to Yountville, and it seems like 
someone is joking with us." 
</P>
<P>
Some are bound to think that, with the attendant publicity McGuire received 
after his sophomore season, he might have suffered from maximal cranial 
syndrome. The symptoms? Swelling of the noggin, inflation of the ego and a 
semi-permanent squinting of the eyes from reading news clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, to a degree, that his expectations were what the papers read them to 
be," Gibson said. "That puts a lot of pressure on a 16-year-old kid, to try to 
live up to those expectations. It doesn't help to get that overwhelming press 
at times." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire insists, however, that the slump was attributable solely to the 
pressure he placed on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was my head swelling or thinking I was better than I was, I 
think it was more that I had unrealistic expectations for myself," he said. "I 
felt that I had to do more than I really had to do, that I had to be a 
left-handed power first baseman. That's just not me." 
</P>
<P>
And lately, by design or not, he has not played like one. Certainly, the 
offensive explosiveness is there, but in contrast to the hitting habits of 
nearly every other high school player with above-average power, McGuire has 
stopped pulling the ball. Almost completely. 
</P>
<P>
In the four-game District 20 playoffs, McGuire, who bats left, hit two home 
runs to left field. By the time West opened play in the Area 6 playoffs last 
weekend, teams were using a Ted Williams shift -- the center fielder was in the 
alley in left-center and the second baseman was shading McGuire up the middle. 
Nevertheless, the location of McGuire's playoff hits reads like a military 
cadence: Left, left, left, right, left. 
</P>
<P>
A well-known major league scout, in fact, remarked to Gibson after an Area 6 
game that McGuire's inability to pull the ball is raising some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"Being left-handed and facing mostly right-handed pitchers, they will try to 
pitch him outside if they can," Gibson said. "It's a mistake on their part, 
because he can drill that pitch. But he will have to learn to turn more quickly 
on the ball. Later in his career, he'll see more velocity (from pitchers) and 
he may not get those opposite-field hits he's getting now -- they may be foul 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire still hits for power -- not many 17-year-olds can hit 380-foot line 
drives the other way -- but he insists that trying to pull the ball under these 
circumstances would be self-defeating. If pitchers pull their punches by 
tossing him off-speed stuff on the outside corner, McGuire says he's happy to 
settle for a gapper to left-center. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they threw to me in the two tournaments, with fastballs and breaking 
balls, I'm fighting myself and I'm fighting them if I try to pull those 
pitches," McGuire said. "Believe me, it's tough to sit there and try to hit it 
into their shift, but it's tougher to try to hit around it." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, marks a shift of sorts for McGuire too. Last year, he might 
have tried to pull similar offerings. 
</P>
<P>
"The slump was awful to go through, but I understand a lot more about myself 
because of it," he said. "Now, if I go one-for-four or oh-for-four, I don't 
come back to the dugout and spike my helmet and throw my bat. 
</P>
<P>
"Having that poor season was a real learning experience."

MACEWEN SWIMS BACK TO NATIONALS THREE YEARS AFTER HER DEBUT AT 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dante can't teach Shauna MacEwen anything about purgatory. She could write her 
own book about it after waiting three long years between her first appearance 
in the U. S. Senior National swim meet as a 14-year-old and her second, this 
summer as a 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
MacEwen's idea of the paradisio has long been a return to the national meet, 
and she finally fulfilled her quest by making a national cut July 14 at the Los 
Angeles Invitational with a time of 8 minutes, 54.32 seconds in the 800-meter 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
MacEwen, who lives in Westlake Village, swam the 800-meter freestyle in the 
nationals Friday at the USC Olympic Pool and finished 14th, earning three 
points for her Thousand Oaks-based Daland United Swim Team. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting here was the big deal," MacEwen said. "Anything I did was icing on the 
cake." 
</P>
<P>
MacEwen swam an 8:57.24 and finished a strong third in her early afternoon 
heat. Janet Evans won the 800 with an 8:22.11 in the evening heat, which 
included the eight top-seeded swimmers entering the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be top 16, so that kind of makes up for being a little off on 
time," said MacEwen, whose time was a full second slower than the personal 
record she set at age 14. "It's a lot of fun to be here, but it's also 
stressful." 
</P>
<P>
MacEwen had begun to wonder if she would ever again compete in the senior 
nationals. When her swimming career went into limbo for three years, her 
spirits did the limbo, dropping down every time she failed to make a cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen 100 girls do great at 14 and never do it again," said MacEwen, who 
will be a senior at Westlake High. "That was my big fear, that I had peaked at 
14. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I didn't make it, I cried. When I didn't make it again, I cried 
but not as much. The third time I didn't cry. I'd almost gotten used to not 
making it." 
</P>
<P>
As MacEwen grew older, her perspective on swimming changed, and it affected her 
performance in the pool for better and worse. Learning that there was life 
outside the lane dividers helped her deal with her disappointments, but she 
also lost the single-mindedness that drove her as a 14-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't put in the huge amount of work we did five or six years ago," said 
Ingrid Daland, MacEwen's coach. "When you're 14, you're full of enthusiasm. You 
have no social life. You just do it. . . . Then she got more into the high 
school scene, and all her friends are not into swimming, and it makes it really 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
MacEwen's time in swimming purgatory was lengthened by the sin of forgetting 
how she had initially excelled. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer after eighth grade was the best summer I've ever had in my life," 
MacEwen said. "I thought the world was mine. I thought I could work out when I 
wanted to, do what I wanted to, and it took a few months to realize it wouldn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to make her senior national cuts and intimidated by her initial 
experience at that level, MacEwen retreated to junior national swimming. She 
dominated there, winning the 400-meter freestyle in the 1986 nationals and the 
200 and 800 in the 1987 meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm this little 14-year-old, my first time there, and boy did it scare me," 
MacEwen said of her first senior national experience. "Right around the middle 
of that three-year period where I got stuck, it was almost more comfortable to 
be at junior nationals and at the top of junior nationals rather than at the 
bottom of senior nationals." 
</P>
<P>
MacEwen showed signs of breaking out of her swimming lethargy in the Southern 
Section meet this year when she placed third in the 500-yard free and fifth in 
the 200 free. Her top-16 finish in the nationals should catch recruiters' eyes 
as she enters her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"Freshman year, Texas was the place I had to go," MacEwen said. "All I know now 
is that when I go to college I want it to be a Division I school, and I want to 
swim four years. Now that I'm on the right track after three years of going 
nowhere, four years doesn't seem that much."

ROBERT HILBURN: A ROCKY START FOR DEACON BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rule No. 1 for a highly touted British band making its local debut: However 
ecstatic the crowds were back home, don't come on stage here expecting -- or, 
even worse, trying to force -- immediate frenzy. It's better to underplay than 
overplay. 
</P>
<P>
Rule No. 2: Don't chide folks seated at the rear tables for not getting up and 
dancing midway through the show. You're just pointing out that the music itself 
hasn't been sufficiently stirring to make those people want to leave their 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Deacon Blue lead singer Ricky Ross ought to paste the rules on his next U.S. 
tour itinerary. By breaking both of them Thursday night at the Roxy, he got his 
highly touted Scottish rock band's first local appearance off to a decidedly 
clumsy start. 
</P>
<P>
Ross rushed on stage shortly after 10 with the anxious energy of a man about to 
yell "Fire!" 
</P>
<P>
As the rest of the six-piece group got settled, he paced back and forth, 
striking a few Springsteen-ish rock-hero poses before lunging at the microphone 
and singing Buddy Holly's old hit "Not Fade Away" with the urgency of someone 
who thought he had just seen the new "future of rock 'n' roll" -- in the 
mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to create an immediate explosion -- a connection with the greats 
in rock history -- and it may have worked some nights back on the campaign 
trail in Britain. But it just seemed awkward and even a touch embarrassing this 
night. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't a room filled with devoted followers, but mostly curious onlookers 
who must have felt they were part of some video shoot. There was such a sense 
of exaggerated emotion in Ross' manner that he seemed to be acting out some 
triumphant concert moment for, say, the upcoming "Eddie and the Cruisers II." 
Ross -- with his boyish, clean-cut appearance -- even resembled "Eddie's" 
Michael Pare. You kept waiting for someone to yell "Cut." 
</P>
<P>
If all this helped keep it from being a night to remember, there were moments 
in the final half of the 90-minute show -- after Ross loosened up -- that 
suggested Deacon Blue is a band worth watching. Ross, who put the band together 
in 1985, shares the rock-as-inspiration sensibilities of such figures as 
Springsteen and U2's Bono Hewson, and he writes appealing, compact songs. He 
also showed late in the show that he could relate to an audience on a more 
convincing and intimate level. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' tunes on Deacon Blue's first album, "Raintown," carry an especially 
strong sense of detail and emotion. While the lyrics on the new "When the World 
Knows Your Name" sometimes lack definition, the music itself is brighter -- a 
touch of post-Motown snap and the Celtic soul of Van Morrison. There are some 
imaginative touches in the arrangements, including the way Lorraine McIntosh's 
vocals interlock with Ross'. 
</P>
<P>
The Roxy show was part of a brief, introductory U.S. tour. If Ross can learn to 
be more personal and less of a role player next time around, the band could 
well be quite special. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's show was opened by Toad the Wet Sprocket, a promising young Santa 
Barbara band (lead singer Glen Phillips is just 18) with a strong R.E.M. 
instrumental shading. While the quartet's arrangements tend to be somewhat 
colorless and a little flat, there is an interesting blend of youthful idealism 
and wary pessimism in Phillips' frequently imaginative lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
THE STONES' SHOWS: According to Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones -- who will be 
at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Oct. 21 with Guns N' Roses and Living 
Colour -- have rehearsed 45 to 50 songs for their upcoming tour, but are now 
concentrating on about 30 for the show, which he estimates will run about two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is you can't play a high-energy show for more than two hours," he 
said by phone this week from Washington, Conn., where the band has been 
rehearsing for the group's first U.S. tour in eight years. "You can go three 
hours if you play a lower-energy show and take some rests and throw in a few 
long ballads. We're aiming for more energy this time and two hours is about the 
max for that." 
</P>
<P>
Jagger said that he never doubted the Stones would eventually tour again, 
despite his break from the band to record two solo albums and play brief solo 
tours in Japan and Australia. Those moves were bitterly criticized by Stones 
guitarist Keith Richards, who followed with his own solo album and U.S. solo 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed very much the solo tour, especially Australia because there were 
more shows than in Japan and I got my teeth into it," Jagger said. "But I 
always thought we would do this tour this year. The only question I had was 
whether we could get the record done in time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the new record is a great improvement over 'Dirty Work,' " Jagger 
added, comparing "Steel Wheels" (due in stores Aug. 29) to its 1986 
predecessor. "That album had a couple of nice things in it but, on reflection, 
not a lot of depth. This one has a lot more variation musically and lyrically."

ARTS COUNCIL BLASTS ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP

Members of the National Endowment for the Arts' advisory council Friday 
condemned the political controversy besetting the agency as a harbinger of an 
era of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"History has proven that the freedom to create can only be healthy for a 
country," said Sally Brayley Bliss, a North Carolina dance authority and 
council member. "If there is censorship, this can lead to the end of 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Added Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los 
Angeles: "The worst fallout of all of this is that we all start to edit 
ourselves because we think someone else will think unkindly of us." 
</P>
<P>
The 24-member, presidentially appointed National Council on the Arts met at 
what was originally scheduled as a routine session to discuss operations of the 
national endowment's programs. But a series of events that have shaken the 
endowment in the last few weeks altered the character of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Involved are two related recent actions in Congress: House of Representatives 
sanctions against the endowment that bar two prominent arts institutions from 
receiving federal funds for five years in a dispute over allegedly indecent 
artwork funded by the agency, and last week's Senate amendment to an endowment 
funding bill by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) that would prohibit federal funding 
of any artwork judged "obscene," "indecent" or likely to offend religious 
sensibilities. Both the Senate and House would provide $171.4 million for the 
arts endowment next year. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy -- precipitated by the endowment's role in funding an exhibit 
that included an image of a crucifix immersed in urine by photographer Andres 
Serrano and another traveling show of work of the late photographer Robert 
Mapplethorpe -- has developed into the worst crisis for the endowment since it 
was formed almost 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Mapplethorpe images, which are currently being shown to large crowds at the 
Washington Project for the Arts, includes some pictures of a homoerotic or 
sadomasochistic nature. The agencies affected by the blacklist provisions of 
the House bill are the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in 
Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University 
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment's acting chairman, Hugh Southern, acknowledged that the recent 
developments had focused new and critical attention on the way the agency 
parcels out its money to arts projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We are what we grant," Southern told the council, in urging that a 
reevaluation of the NEA's grant-making process, which actually began a year 
ago, be actively pursued. 
</P>
<P>
Southern said the recent congressional criticism of the endowment's grant 
making challenges the agency to "be able to say, here it is. It's sound. You 
can believe it. You can trust it." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the two-day meeting that began Friday is scheduled to include a 
session on planning for the agency's quarter-century anniversary -- a 
celebration that could be clouded if a House-Senate conference committee 
scheduled to meet just after Labor Day preserves either or both of the 
restrictive provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, meanwhile, arts advocates were struggling Friday to 
counteract the second of two state measures under consideration by the 
legislature in Raleigh that would enact state penalties against the center. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the state House of Representatives moved to cut off state funding 
from the center for its role in the controversy -- specifically its selection 
of the photograph entitled "Piss Christ" that was included in the 
endowment-funded Awards in the Visual Arts program last year. 
</P>
<P>
Arts agencies negotiated a compromise in which that measure was apparently 
neutralized. On Tuesday, however, the North Carolina Senate, acting on a 
proposal by conservatives, approved a version of the Helms language that would 
bar any state funds from being given to arts projects that "denigrate" 
religious beliefs. The provision was introduced without warning in the 
appropriations committee. 
</P>
<P>
The North Carolina Arts Council and Arts Advocates, a private group, were 
optimistic Thursday that the latest development could be neutralized in a state 
house-senate conference committee, but lobbyists for arts groups said that the 
result would not be clear for at least several days. 
</P>
<P>
National Endowment sources familiar with delicate negotiations now under way in 
the Congress also were optimistic that the two bills could be thwarted in 
conference-committee bargaining. The endowment has warned that they "would have 
a chilling impact on artistic expression" and on the willingness of arts 
organizations to involve themselves with work "deemed to be at all 
controversial or out of the mainstream."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NO CHEERS FOR SAM AND DIANE

<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, after months of advance promotion and mounting suspense, Sam Donaldson 
and Diane Sawyer were appearing on the screen together. There they were in 
glowing neon, bigger and brighter than news itself. There they were, the 
multimillion-dollar man and woman, as the media titled them. There they were, 
"two of the world's most formidable journalists," as ABC titled them. There 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
Not being very formidable. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson and Ronald Reagan got better information from each other shouted over 
the roar of chopper blades than America got Thursday night from the premiere of 
ABC's "PrimeTime Live" news program. Maybe if we all cupped our ears. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The hour had a narrow target audience: viewers who had been hermetically sealed 
underground and unable to watch a newscast or pick up a newspaper for the last 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
You can admire a program's ambition to be incisively topical in contrast to the 
soft, gumminess of NBC's "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," which premiered the 
night before. But bring something new to the table, at least. Instead, 
Thursday's ABC entree was live, all right -- live, warmed-over "World News 
Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Just why "PrimeTime Live" chose to begin life by interviewing Thomas Root -- 
the much-reported-on figure who survived his private plane going into the sea 
only to face questions about his gunshot wound and business dealings -- is as 
baffling as Root himself. Sawyer asked the questions that others had asked and, 
in a real coup, got the same answers. 
</P>
<P>
Did Root shoot himself intentionally? No. Did he have shady business dealings? 
No. Was he involved in drugs? No. Suddenly the screen filled with a copy of a 
bounced check Root allegedly had written two days before the incident. Well? 
Root wouldn't discuss his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Already, new and exciting "PrimeTime Live" was thick with must and deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
Root did complain that while other, bigger news stories come and go, "I linger 
on. There's no reason for it." So bothered was he by the attention that he 
agreed to be interviewed on "PrimeTime Live." 
</P>
<P>
Next, "PrimeTime Live" weighed in with its own coverage of the on-going hostage 
story, checking in with Secretary of State James Baker in Washington, the 
show's correspondent Chris Wallace in Israel and ABC News correspondent and 
former hostage Charles Glass in the studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
The din of sameness reached a deafening level when a studio audience/town 
meeting segment disintegrated into another of those 
What-would-you-do-about-the-hostages-if-you-were-President? choruses that have 
been dominating radio and TV talk shows all week. 
</P>
<P>
There was also this nitty-gritty from former CIA director Stansfield Turner and 
former Deputy Secretary of Defense Noel Koch: Their own military plans to 
rescue the American hostages. Like everyone else, they agreed that getting 
rescuers in without killing the hostages in the process would be almost 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd have to get in that room before that guard heard them coming. . . ," 
Donaldson added later. For this they're paying him a salary? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no. ABC is paying Donaldson and Sawyer the moon -- less for their 
journalism than for their personalities, hoping that together and in the right 
surroundings they can create TV magic. On paper, yes. 
</P>
<P>
Covering the White House for ABC for so many years made the capable, aggressive 
Donaldson not only the most recognizable and, in some eyes, most contemptible 
network correspondent ever, but also an institution whose celebrity often 
eclipsed the stories he covered. What better match for the rough-edged "beast" 
than the soft-edged "beauty"? Sawyer's intelligence, good looks and old-money 
polish were regularly displayed on the popular CBS series "60 Minutes," making 
her one of the hottest commodities in TV news. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers are often attracted to news programs for personalities. So perhaps the 
mere sights and sounds of Donaldson-Sawyer alone will suffice. Perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson and Sawyer added their voices Thursday to the multitudes complaining 
about inadequate U.S. ground intelligence in areas of the Middle East where 
American hostages are thought to be held. 
</P>
<P>
But what about something much easier to attain -- advance intelligence by 
"PrimeTime Live" about its interview subjects, enabling it to anticipate the 
duds? 
</P>
<P>
"Dud" is a charitable description of what transpired via satellite Thursday 
between Sawyer and Roseanne Barr, who had written an article in the New York 
Times earlier in the week complaining about constant media attention. 
</P>
<P>
"PrimeTime Live" is topical and on top of the news, right? So you'd think that 
Sawyer would have asked Barr to comment on the fact that both the actress and 
her hit ABC comedy series "Roseanne" were snubbed in the Emmy nominations 
announced that very morning. Sawyer didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Barr necessarily would have responded. It was that kind of interview. 
Sawyer would have had an easier time extracting teeth from a yak. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the drawback of "live" interviews, which are far more dangerous than they 
are exciting. If the interview dies, so does the interviewer, and the show. 
Perhaps that's why Barbara Walters -- who got much more from her session with 
Barr a few months ago -- interviews on tape. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer did get a few words -- on tape -- from Nora Ephron, screenwriter for the 
over-covered movie "When Harry Met Sally. . . ." Why do yet another piece on 
this movie? Because of all the chat "we've heard at luncheons and dinners" 
about the possibility of men and women being just friends, said Sawyer. Would 
those be luncheons and dinners in Peoria? 
</P>
<P>
"Two of the world's most formidable journalists" did manage to squeeze in a lot 
of promotion -- of that evening's "Nightline" and of the next episode of 
"PrimeTime Live." That one would be real good, Sawyer and Donaldson promised.

CAN THE CIRCUS STILL COMPETE WITH TV, MOVIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blame it on big-budget, thriller-killer movies a la "Batman" or "Indiana 
Jones," or reality-based tabloid TV, with its re-created moments of 
death-defying accidents and murder. Or lay it to the emotion-numbing, stark 
reality of daily hostage headlines in every newspaper in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, the circus just doesn't quite provide the thrill quotient it 
once did, if you're fortysomething. 
</P>
<P>
The 119th edition of Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey's "Greatest Show on 
Earth" (a registered trademark) remains spangled and spectacular in its own way 
and a bargain at $8 a head. Even the worst seats at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena, where America's preeminent traveling circus is currently making its 
annual 11-day stand, afford a terrific view of acrobats and clowns, bosomy 
showgirls and dancing bears. 
</P>
<P>
But how does a trapeze artist's "legendary triple somersault" or a lion tamer's 
"dazzling defiance of danger" compete with Michael Keaton's drubbing of the 
Joker or Harrison Ford's rout of the entire Third Reich? How do run-of-the-mill 
dwarfs and giants compete with Geraldo's panels of hermaphrodites and hookers? 
And how do the hanging Arnosi Duo compete with the apparent hanging of Marine 
Lt. Col. William Higgins on the nightly news? 
</P>
<P>
Keeping pace with the main events and the sideshows offered up on the tube or 
the neighborhood cineplex is a tough, losing battle at best these days, 
particularly in the jaded eyes of adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Ringling Brothers -- or, rather, the marketing, sales and development staff 
of the multimillion-dollar, Washington, D.C.-based corporation that the circus 
has become -- can thank the children of the world for keeping them in business. 
It's the kiddies who still drag their moms and dads to the bleachers and pump 
them for cotton candy money. Even though the Dumbo days of pure big-top magic 
30 years ago have given way to a slick, all-too-plastic environment in 
less-romantic venues such as basketball arenas, the pre-puberty crowd hasn't 
been turned off completely by the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
Yet. 
</P>
<P>
The circus remains an introductory course in mesmerizing medieval morality 
plays for tots. The younger the years, the wider the eyes when live lions march 
out of their cages and snarl at the crowd. In all three rings for 2 1/2 hours a 
show, the opportunities for good to overcome evil and for life to defeat death 
pop up nonstop before their unblinking faces. The ringmaster's superlatives 
still carry currency. The parade of wrinkled, prehistoric elephants still 
boggles their minds. 
</P>
<P>
On opening night Wednesday, two young critics offered up these observations 
following the first hour of high-wire walking and tiger taming: 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the acrobats best because they were daring and debonair," said 
9-year-old Kimber Thompson of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Her 10-year-old companion, Kate Michelle of Long Beach, was partial to the 
Flying Lunas, who swung through the air with the greatest of ease, losing their 
grip from time to time but, fortunately, landing in a net two stories beneath 
their trapeze swings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're exciting and thrilling," she said in clipped, self-assured tones 
during intermission. Moments later, they both raced off to a clown kiosk where 
kids can get their faces painted and their parents can have Polaroid pictures 
shot of them for $6 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Children believe the purple alliteration that spews from the microphone at 
center ring (" . . . death-defying display while executing spectacular stunts 
with awesome power, precision and poise. . . ."). And children don't scoff when 
an aging animal tamer with the unlikely name of Gunther Gebel-Williams is 
touted as "the greatest living circus legend of our time." 
</P>
<P>
Looking like an albino Moammar Kadafi, Gebel-Williams is this year's chief 
calling card for the circus. This is his last year on tour with the spectacle, 
and the live band even plays an original composition dedicated to 
Gebel-Williams at the close of the show. He's a circus man, sings the 
ringmaster in a voice reminiscent of Bert Parks' paeon to Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, the 54-year-old veteran is a circus man. Whether the hype accorded 
him throughout the performance is warranted, Gebel-Williams seems to have paid 
his dues. According to the "Gunther Gebel-Williams Farewell Tour Special 
Collector's Edition" of the $5 circus program, he has spent the past 20 years 
getting "smashed, trampled, bitten, slashed and clawed by fighting cats. His 
body is covered with over 500 stitches. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Where the stitches all are is open to speculation. His well-muscled and 
apparently unscarred arms, chest and legs are exposed at one time or another 
during the cat taming and elephant parade portions of the show. As one 
avuncular vendor selling Gunther Gebel-Williams pennants, T-shirts, 
commemorative mugs, baseball caps, souvenir pens, buttons and watches said at 
the close of the show, "I should look so good when I'm his age." 
</P>
<P>
But Gebel-Williams is also, quite correctly, symbolic of the very reason that 
the circus keeps drawing the crowds of kids year after year, despite the 
debatable wonders of television and movies in this age of entertainment 
one-upsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
As he tap danced on the back of an elephant during the finale, Gebel-Williams 
dropped his deadly serious lion tamer's expression for a moment and grinned 
wide enough to be seen from Loge 25, on the far side of the Sports Arena. The 
kid critics, back from the clown kiosk with white pancake makeup smeared from 
chin to brow, and red tipping each of their noses, grinned back. Then they both 
stood up, as did dozens of youngsters all over the arena, and did a little 
dance of triumph along with Gebel-Williams. 
</P>
<P>
A death-defying dance. 
</P>
<P>
Without stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Without scars. 
</P>
<P>
Without risk. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the thrills that adults have forsaken for the fantasy of the 
network "Circus of the Stars," the production values of "Ghostbusters II" or 
the ugly reality of the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
Death-defying stunts and mind-blowing gymnastics may be better, cheaper and 
more accessible on the tube or at the local theater, but in the end they don't 
match the aura of the circus, up close and personal . . . especially if you're 
10 years old.

PUNK ROCK HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed reading "Kids of the Black Hole" (about the history of the Orange 
County punk rock movement, July 23). I'm faxing copies to my L.A. and San 
Francisco friends who don't believe me when I tell them that Orange County 
wasn't always on the fringe of absolute cultural vacuity, in which it now seems 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
Circa 1981, we had similar Black Holes around Newport at which the Vandals, the 
Crowd and others were showcased on numerous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Though I have some hideous specific memories collected from the wreckage, as a 
whole I look back on those days very fondly. For one thing, hardly anything 
compares to the fantastic exuberance of letting loose a raging libido, not to 
mention the special camaraderie you get from communally hating those 
optimistic, hard-working, productive types. We had more fun than the F. Scott 
Fitzgeralds. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can't go on so uncontrollably and still earn a living. But I'm 
glad at least someone is making an effort to contribute something of value to 
the O.C. scene. These bands, by way of their history and poetry, have much to 
offer.

<P>
Steve Flowers of Chino Hills had known 17-year-old Tony Ramirez since Tony was 
a toddler. They had never been very fond of each other, Flowers recalls, and 
their relationship wasn't enhanced when he married Tony's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Tony admits he was cutting classes and had an attitude as long as the 91 
Freeway. And Flowers remembers that in his new role as stepfather he was 
getting rubbed the wrong way too often. 
</P>
<P>
One day last year, though, Flowers took Tony bowling. To the delight of both, 
Tony discovered an unusual penchant for knocking over pins. They began to bowl 
together regularly, becoming so accomplished a duo, in fact, that they entered 
the 1988 Avco Family Bowling Tournament, winning the finals for Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, held annually for the last 14 years, pairs children with a 
parent or grandparent in an attempt by Avco Financial Services and, before 
them, by the Bowling Proprietor's Assn. of America, to foster family 
togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
Regional winners receive a $500 college scholarship and a free trip to 
Washington to compete in the nationals. National winners can win scholarships 
up to $5,000 per age division. 
</P>
<P>
In October, however, Flowers' right leg, hip and right arm were severely 
disabled by rheumatism. Undaunted, the pain-ridden Flowers hobbled onto the 
lanes and began to train himself to bowl left-handed. Anything to keep Tony 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Flowers and Ramirez placed second in the state finals. Moreover, it 
was Tony who carried the two of them. 
</P>
<P>
The family that plays together, as growing numbers of Americans have 
discovered, stays together. At a time when the traditional nuclear family -- 
those with the mother at home, the father at work, the children at school and 
no domestic help or live-in relatives to count on -- has become an endangered 
species, this realization appears to have sparked a modest renaissance 
throughout the country in organized family recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Many American families, of course, continue to seek recreation on their own. 
Camping, fishing and other outdoor pursuits remain staples of the American 
recreative scene. And in some areas, city parks and recreation departments 
offer organized family-type activities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Jackie Tatum, assistant general manager for the Valley region, 
points out a plethora of recreative alternatives for families, which include 
softball, baseball and soccer teams in which parents participate as coaches and 
team mothers; equestrian centers such as the one at Griffith Park, and numerous 
Mommy &amp; Me programs for women with children between 18 months and 2 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Activities 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and nationally, however, there has been a pronounced paucity of 
organized leisure activities structured for the entire family. Jim Hadaway, 
general manager of recreation and parks for the city of Los Angeles, notes that 
his department has preferred to invest in such family-supportive activities as 
preschools, day care and latchkey programs rather than, say, softball leagues 
in which every member of the family, whatever their skill level, can play. 
</P>
<P>
Yet after decades of segregating leisure activities by age, sex and skill 
level, a few recreation providers in both the private and public sectors are 
packaging such pursuits as bowling, tennis and Volkssporting -- a German 
variety of non-competitive pastimes that translate as "People Sports" -- to 
involve every member of the family. 
</P>
<P>
They are doing so in the growing conviction that family play opens the lines of 
communication within this much-beleaguered institution, and salves the rifts 
and fissures all families -- no matter how they are structured -- accrue as a 
matter of course in today's world. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Lamke is chairman of the department of recreation at San Diego State 
University and director of the Institute for Leisure Behavior in San Diego. He 
believes that the proliferation of specialized leisure pursuits in America that 
occurred after World War II -- freeing mom to play tennis while dad golfed, 
junior pitched for a Little League team and sis pirouetted at dance class -- 
was nothing less than a social disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"During the mid- to late-'70s in particular," Lamke noted, "it became important 
for each individual to become self-actualized. Everyone found a little niche 
and explored it. Everyone became a member of the 'me' generation. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, kids were consequently deprived of good role models. Without 
any lasting interaction with their folks, they lacked direction, guidance and 
the skills they needed to take care of themselves. The result was a lot of 
teen-age problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unhealthy Situation 
</P>
<P>
If this situation proved unhealthy for the traditional family structure, it 
wreaked havoc upon those in which contact between family members had already 
been minimized or undermined by divorce or the demands of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere has this been more evident than in Canada, where one-third of all 
marriages end in divorce; where families, which average 3.2 persons, are 
smaller than anywhere in the world, and where only 20% of them fit the 
traditional mold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Program 
</P>
<P>
Recreation experts such as Jack Harper, a faculty member of the Physical 
Education and Recreation Studies at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, 
responded by developing a national program aimed at generating awareness as to 
the desirability of organized recreational activities for the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
Although the effects of his "Together is Better" program have yet to be 
assessed objectively, Harper says he believes he can discern in his country a 
departure among public recreation providers from male-oriented, skill-intensive 
recreational programming toward a more generalized and inclusive family format. 
</P>
<P>
Public recreation agencies in Canada, he says, have begun supporting such 
leisure pursuits as block parties by dispatching mobile vans with tug-of-war 
ropes and other game equipment. Back-yard camping has also become popular, with 
public parks signing out tents and other camping equipment free of charge for 
the weekend. Swimming and skating lessons are being provided to people 
regardless of age or sex. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in the United States, two nationally organized, regularly scheduled 
family sporting opportunities have been developed through corporate 
sponsorship: the Avco Family Bowling Tournament and the Equitable Family Tennis 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Avco, which target their loans to families, believed 
supporting family sports to be a good business investment, although there is 
some talk that they may turn the tournament back to the Bowling Proprietors 
Assn. after this year, according to Richard Steinbaugh, executive director of 
the association, who says the tournament will continue no matter who sponsors 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motivations behind this sponsorship, though, these bowling and 
tennis activities do seem to be getting families out of their sometimes 
debilitating ruts. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Tomasello, a 40-year-old textile sales rep from Sherman Oaks, gets his 
14-year-old daughter, Nicole, on the weekends. During the week, Nicole lives 
with her mother in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father-Daughter Game 
</P>
<P>
Tomasello spends much of his own leisure time playing tennis, and Nicole 
belonged to an Orange County team until last year, when she gave up the game to 
follow other interests. But with high school looming in September, Nicole 
decided she wanted to make the school tennis team. Getting her on the courts to 
practice, however, proved no mean feat, said Tomasello, who thought that 
committing her to play the Equitable in June would do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
The Equitable, sponsored by the Equitable Life Assurance Society for the last 
15 years, is touted as the world's largest amateur tennis tournament. Involving 
more than 175,000 participants annually, it pits family doubles teams against 
each other in mother/daughter, mother/son, father/daughter, father/son, 
husband/wife and brother/sister constellations. Local play began in May and 
June at about 240 tennis clubs throughout the country, and the regional winners 
compete at the U.S. Open in New York during September. 
</P>
<P>
Kristine Heinberg of Agoura Hills never needed an excuse to get out on the 
courts. Though only 9 years old, she's ranked No. 1 in the girls 12s division 
in Ventura County. She has not yet played tournaments within the United States 
Tennis Assn., and thus qualifies to play the Equitable Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Kristine has been hitting regularly with her father, 39-year-old Craig 
Heinberg, a tennis instructor, since she was 6, while her 6-year-old brother, 
Ryan, trains with his mother, Diane. Tennis, Craig says, is very much a family 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans would rather avoid stressful competition. For those, there are 
less aggressive alternatives. Among them, "volksmarching," sponsored by the 
American Volkssport Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volkssports Take Hold 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-'70s, when it was first imported from Germany by servicemen and 
their families, volkssporting has become increasingly popular as a 
non-competitive family pastime. 
</P>
<P>
While volkssporting in Europe includes non-competitive walking, swimming and 
cross-country skiing, Southlanders appear interested mainly in the pedestrian 
pursuit volksmarching. 
</P>
<P>
It's a cross between a sightseeing outing and a race, explains Stephen Stone, 
26, a word processor in Hollywood who has helped form volksmarching clubs in 
Southern California and, in 1987, established the Hollywood Star Trekkers. 
</P>
<P>
Events are planned along routes of scenic or historic interest. Volksmarchers 
are required to complete the march, which averages between 6 and 12 miles, 
within a generously proscribed time period (rambles last between 3 and 6 hours, 
but there are no winners or losers). 
</P>
<P>
Participants, who include babies in strollers and the elderly, are encouraged 
to take their time, talk to each other and rest frequently. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 15 clubs in Southern California that host between them an 
average of three outings a month. Stone estimates the existence of about 600 
hard-core volksmarchers in the Southland and perhaps several thousand 
taggers-along. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the no-hassle feeling of just walking along," he says. "In a world 
where people don't sit around the dinner table talking like they used to, 
volksmarching gives you a chance to communicate and exercise concurrently. And 
you get to see parts of the area you never would by car." 
</P>
<P>
Lamke believes that as volksmarching and other family leisure pursuits continue 
to attract greater numbers of Americans, as corporations continue to sponsor 
family-friendly activities and as country clubs host parent-child tennis and 
golf tournaments, public recreation providers in the United States will find 
themselves responding with programs of their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classes in the Works 
</P>
<P>
In some municipalities, this process has already begun in earnest. Katherine 
Chappelear, superintendent of recreation for the Department of Parks and 
Recreation in Sunnyvale, Calif., says her office has introduced programs 
emphasizing intergenerational activities -- parent/child swim classes, play 
exploration classes and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Most municipalities, however, have not explored the possibility, for instance, 
of altering the structure of softball teams so that kids and parents can 
actually play together in leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've seen so far in this country is just a start," Lamke said. "We have 
a long way to go, and I think it's going to take policy directives issued by 
governmental agencies for us to do the concept of family play justice." 
</P>
<P>

GET YOUR KICKS AT NISEI WEEK KARATE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the possible exception of the Green Berets, virtually all martial artists 
trace their origins back into millennial mists where monks, most likely 
Buddhist, endeavored to teach their flocks how to defend themselves against the 
depredations of marauders. 
</P>
<P>
Karate is no exception. Leaving aside frenetic movie versions of the art and 
what California-based shihan (master teacher) Tsutomu Oshima calls 
"shopping-center karate," this particular physical endeavor was conceived about 
1,400 years ago in China, refined on the island of Okinawa, introduced to Japan 
in 1922 by shihan Gichin Funakoshi and exported to the United States in the 
mid-1950s by Oshima, one of the last disciples to have studied directly under 
Funakoshi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karate Exhibition 
</P>
<P>
Oshima -- whose Caltech Karate Club was arguably the first in America, will be 
present tonight at the 33rd annual Nisei Week Karate Exhibition in Los Angeles, 
claimed to be the oldest and largest such tournament in the United States. 
Attracting teams from around the country, the free exhibition (6-8 p.m. at the 
Nishi Hongwanji gym, 815 E. 1st St. in Little Tokyo) will include kihon (basic 
blocks, punches, kicks and stances), kata (series of prearranged forms and 
movements simulating combat situations) and kumite, the actual competition. 
</P>
<P>
As much as the evening promises a spectacle of action commingled with the grace 
of the sport/art, the underlying philosophy of karate will be a subtext to what 
sometimes seems to be ritualized mayhem. Attainment of the prized "black belt" 
for physical proficiency is, Oshima says, only a beginning. The ultimate object 
of true karate practice is perfection of oneself through perfection of the art. 
Karate, reads the brochure announcing the L.A. tourney, "develops composure, 
deeper insight into one's mental capabilities and more confidence," not to 
slight the ability to knock an unwary attacker into next week. 
</P>
<P>
Self-discipline is paramount: "Our own opponent is ourselves," Oshima says. "We 
have to cut out our ego first." Easier said than done, and not all that easy, 
either, to put into words: "It's like trying to teach what hot and cold is," 
says Oshima: "You have to experience it, feel it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Perfection of Character' 
</P>
<P>
First-time spectators at tonight's tournament may find the concept difficult to 
grasp -- rooting for a particular contestant or team is quintessentially 
American -- but tournament spokesman James Uyeda, while stressing the physical 
benefits of karate to both old and young, men and women, reminds neophytes to 
consider the words of Okinawan Funakoshi, modern karate's first great teacher: 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate aim of the art of karate," said Funakoshi, "lies not in victory 
or defeat but in the perfection of the characters of its participants." 
</P>
<P>
For further information, call (213) 839-5170. 
</P>
<P>
(Meanwhile, an international karate championship will be held today and Sunday 
at the Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd. The program includes 
kata, kumite and demonstrations of Oriental weapons. Today 8 a.m.-10 p.m., 
Sunday 8:30 a.m.-10:30 p.m., finals at 7 p.m. Admission $15-$20; children 11 
and under half price; tickets valid both days. Call (213) 436-3661 or (818)

L.A. PUTS THE BARD TO WORK ON URBAN ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER W. FREY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cowboy spouting Shakespeare in the heart of downtown Los Angeles is a sight 
sure to capture the attention of even the most jaded city dweller. 
</P>
<P>
And when you expand the scope to include a stage built to look like the 
California Gold Rush country in the 1840s and add Western guitar and harmonica 
music and a bluegrass band, the Bard himself might be hard-pressed to recognize 
his "As You Like It." Yet, here it is again, the Shakespeare Festival/L.A. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Is Price of Admission 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its being an entertaining outing, the festival, now in its fourth 
year, exhibits a strong interest in community involvement. Admission to the 
show is by donation of canned goods for the homeless, and people attending the 
performances have shown great generosity. Last year, contributions totaled in 
excess of $10,000 in cash and kind. Joining in the philanthropic aspect of the 
event, Vons grocery chain matches the contributions, all of which go to the 
Salvation Army's Harbor Light Mission for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Like Kevin Kelly, the play's director, artistic director Ben Donenberg is from 
New York and is a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music. He grew up with 
the tradition of summertime Shakespeare performances in Central Park, and felt 
the lack of the cultural tradition when he moved to Los Angeles. With the help 
of Citicorp/Citibank, the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and Mrs. 
Ira Gershwin, Donenberg was able to stage the first Shakespeare Festival/L.A. 
in 1986, presenting "Twelfth Night" in Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
"The festival has really begun to root itself in the community," Donenberg 
says. "Many of the major corporations with downtown offices help out, and their 
generosity has allowed us to begin a 'Shakespeare' outreach program in which we 
take Shakespeare puppet shows into schools for fourth- and fifth-grade 
students. With programs like this, the festival is now becoming a year-round 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The updated version of "As You Like It" will be presented at three locations in 
the Southland this month, beginning with performances at Citicorp Plaza 
downtown today and Sunday at 4 p.m. It will be repeated on Friday (a supper 
performance) and next weekend at the Plaza. Then it will move, courtesy of 
County Supervisor Ed Edelman's enthusiasm, to the John Anson Ford Theatre on 
Aug. 18, 19 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
The final weekend of the season will be Aug. 26-27 in the Rainbow Lagoon area 
adjacent to the Long Beach Convention Center, where it will be presented as a 
companion piece to the Long Beach Renaissance Faire, a yearly event that 
benefits the Traveler's Aid Society. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing with this festival is to, as Shakespeare put it, hold a 
mirror up to nature," Donenberg says of the "As You Like It" production. "And 
when you hold Shakespeare up to Los Angeles, his original story line about 
people fleeing the social and moral decay of the French Imperial court in the 
1600s reflects instead the restless immigrant population of New York City in 
the 1840s fleeing to wide-open Western spaces and the lure of gold. The setting 
is new, but anywhere you put him, Shakespeare is still Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
While the setting has been changed and the music updated, devotees of the 
Bard's work should be aware that the organizers knew better than to tamper with 
his dialogue. The performance runs about 2 hours and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Donenberg says no special preparations are necessary, but those wishing to 
better acquaint themselves with the play might benefit from reading one of the 
condensed versions (such as Cliff's Notes), available in bookstores. He does 
advise early reservations when possible (there are only 200 seats available at 
the Citicorp Plaza location and 1,100 at the John Anson Ford Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
 Performances today and Sunday at 4 p.m. Friday's performance is at 6 p.m., and 
on Aug. 12-13 at 4 p.m. Citicorp Plaza is at 7th and Figueroa streets. 
Performances at the John Anson Ford Theatre at 8 p.m. on Aug. 18, 19 and 20; at 
the Rainbow Lagoon adjacent to the Long Beach Convention Center at 8:15 p.m. 
Aug. 26-27. For information and reservations, call (213) 489-1121.

DEPLETED RAMS, 49ERS KICK OFF SEASON IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Considering the task at hand, maybe 5,600 miles isn't far enough from home for 
George Seifert, who makes his pro head coaching debut tonight (Sunday, Japan 
time) when the San Francisco 49ers face the Rams in American Bowl '89 at the 
Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
As it was soon discovered this week, not even crossing the international 
dateline helps. Eager to show the world they've done their homework on a 
strange game that certainly is not baseball, the Japanese were curious to know, 
foremost, what it felt like to replace a legend. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert might have referred them to the new emperor. Instead, he worked his way 
deftly through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we start in this profession, we all tend to live with it," Seifert said 
of handling pressure. "Whether as a head coach, or assistant coaches and 
obviously, the players. That becomes a way of life to us." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Bill Walsh, who coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl 
titles in the 1980s, no longer even hovers in the front office, having recently 
accepted a broadcasting position with NBC. Only the memories of a genius and 
his sweaters remain. 
</P>
<P>
Undramatically, tonight's game should prove little, other than to see how well 
Seifert handles the pregame interviews and sideline headset. The game itself is 
pure ceremony, marking the third consecutive season the Rams will play five 
exhibition games instead of the customary four. It's the second overseas 
exhibition in two years for the 49ers, who faced the Miami Dolphins in London 
last summer. All for the betterment of humanity, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry on the field has long been heated, but what about these owners, 
Edward DeBartolo Jr. and Georgia Frontiere, who have been duking it out in the 
game of international diplomacy? 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo is already challenging Frontiere to a game next year in Milan, Italy. 
Although the Ram owner is interested, she concedes that she may need some time 
to think it over. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the owners have asked coaches Seifert and the Rams' John Robinson to 
put something interesting together for their hosts, which is easier said than 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could be missing seven offensive starters because of injury or 
holdout. Tailback Greg Bell, tight end Damone Johnson and guard Duval Love are 
back on the mainland, poring over negotiating strategies. Flanker-tight end 
Pete Holohan is out with a bad knee, and left guard Tom Newberry and wide 
receiver Aaron Cox have hamstring pulls. Receivers Henry Ellard and Ron Brown 
are doubtful with back and hamstring problems, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
So how can a game live up to its billing? 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling their expectations of the game are very high," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said of the Japanese. "I think all we can do is play as 
aggressive and hard as we can and hopefully win." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson will do his best to squeeze two quarters out of his starting 
quarterback. No one said show business was easy. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a cultural show for the Japanese people," Robinson said. 
"But we don't want to embarrass ourselves. We have mixed goals. We'd like to 
play a lot of people and we'd like to have some rhythm. I think you worry about 
the first game, you know, getting the snap from center." 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, the Rams' offense will be equally matched by the 49er defense, 
which is missing cornerbacks Don Griffin and Tim McKyer, end Larry Roberts, 
linebacker Charles Haley and strong safety Jeff Fuller, all of whom are 
negotiating contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Go out and have a hot dog when we have the ball," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana, Super Bowl hero, will start at quarterback for the 49ers and no 
doubt draw the most attention. His legend stretches across the Pacific and was 
further enhanced by Robinson at an opening-night news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"In Joe Montana, you will see one of the great players ever to play this game," 
Robinson said. "He certainly has been the best quarterback to play in my time 
in the NFL, and I think he will go down in history as perhaps the best 
quarterback of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Does Joe dare throw an incompletion? And what of the transition from Walsh to 
Seifert, a nine-year 49er assistant and the team's defensive coordinator since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference isn't as great as everyone believes," Montana said. "George has 
been in this organization and has been the major reason for our winning. 
Everybody knows what he can do and respects him. For us, it doesn't seem like 
that much of a change. I think there's a little transition in the beginning, 
but practices are going along as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game starts at 7, PDT, and will be televised locally by ESPN and 
KTTV-Fox, Channel 11. . . . The team charter departs immediately after the game 
and arrives home at noon Sunday. The Rams will move their training camp to Cal 
State Fullerton Monday. . . . With Damone Johnson and Pete Holohan out, rookie 
free agent Richard Ashe from Humboldt State gets the start at tight end. . . . 
Gaston Green will start at tailback and split time there with Robert Delpino. 
Buford McGee will start at fullback. . . . On defense, inside linebacker Fred 
Strickland is out with a knee injury and will be replaced by Richard Brown. . . 
. This is the second NFL game to be played in Tokyo. The St. Louis Cardinals 
defeated the San Diego Chargers, 20-10, here on Aug. 16, 1976. . . . The Rams 
are on the road again next week, facing the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium 
Saturday night. The team opens the home exhibition season at Anaheim Stadium 
Aug. 21 against Phoenix.

SHERK WEATHERS STORM AS ONLY WOMAN IN GOLF EVENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Moments after Cathy Sherk strode off the 18th green at Lookout Point Country 
Club here in southern Ontario Friday, a howling rain poured down and a mighty 
wind began to blow. 
</P>
<P>
It was as if someone had called upstairs for a display of symbols, after a week 
of heavy symbolism. Sherk had been the symbol of women competing against men 
and was at the center of a national media barrage, having become the first 
woman to qualify and play in a men's professional golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
And although Sherk, who played for five years on the Ladies Professional Golf 
Assn. tour, was cheerily handling the attention, there were certainly dark 
clouds hovering over her golf game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't as embarrassed today as I was yesterday," Sherk said Friday, after 
finishing with a round of 81 in the $100,000 Ontario Open, playing, of course, 
from the men's tees. It might have been nine over par, but it still represented 
a tremendous improvement over her 91 of the previous day, a round that included 
five double bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a tough week for Sherk, who lives in Toronto, especially with the 
eyes of Canada upon her. Sherk earned the right to play here after shooting a 
72 in a qualifying tournament in nearby Port Colborne. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has been ballyhooed -- incorrectly -- as the first woman to 
play in a PGA-sanctioned event. The Ontario Open is not a PGA event, it is an 
event on the Canadian Tour, and it is not specified as a men's event, although 
no women had ever played in it. 
</P>
<P>
Sherk, 39, is the first woman to have qualified for an open event, but she is 
not the first to play in one. Babe Zaharias played in the 1938 Los Angeles 
Open, shooting 84-81 from the men's tees but missing the cut at Griffith Park. 
She had been declared a pro after endorsing a line of sporting goods and she 
entered the tournament because there was no such thing as a women's pro 
tournament then. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1985, Kathy Whitworth and Mickey Wright played in the Legends 
tournament on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1986, Tracey Kibsey, a club pro from Winnipeg, became the first woman to 
play in a Canadian provincial open. But Kibsey did not have to qualify for the 
Manitoba Open because there wasn't a full field that year. She played in the 
first two rounds, shooting a 76 and then a 71, missing the cut by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Sherk was not that close. Her two-round total of 172 was well above Friday's 
149 cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
Her disastrous first day was something from which she could not recover. Was 
she nervous? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I haven't eaten in three days," she said. "I slept last night but I 
don't think I've slept for three nights before, either. My stomach has been in 
knots. I tell you, I don't know how I teed it up. I don't even remember 
yesterday morning." 
</P>
<P>
That may be for the best. This course, about 90 miles southeast of Toronto and 
eight miles west of Niagara Falls, is enough to knot anyone's stomach. The 
first hole drops 164 feet from tee to green. Several fairways snake through 
narrow canyons in what is known geographically as the Niagara Escarpment. A 
downhill ski run was once operated alongside the 10th fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was humbled by a great golf course," Sherk said after Thursday's round. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's weather made it worse, what with winds gusting to 40 m.p.h. and 
intermittent thundershowers. 
</P>
<P>
Sherk took it all with good humor. Tall and husky, she briskly walked the hilly 
course, smoking and chatting, while trailed by a ragtag gallery that grew as 
the day wore on. Making it more homey was Sherk's 14-year-old son, Chris, who 
was her caddy. 
</P>
<P>
Sherk's partners in the threesome -- Jeff Boismier and Brian Hanson -- lent 
strong moral support, even while getting overshadowed by a lesser player. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped me to focus," Boismier said. "I really enjoyed playing with Cathy. 
She deserved to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Boismier and Hanson had talked to Sherk Friday morning before they teed off and 
told her to forget Thursday's round and relax. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant a lot to me," she said. "They have been really supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Sherk might have received some support simply because she's from this area -- 
she used to be a member at Lookout Point -- and she's not trying to rock the 
boat. She said this tournament is special because it's at Lookout Point and 
because there was a special ceremony for club professional Gordon McInnis, who 
has been her coach for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was certainly not trying to be smart or make a point by qualifying," she 
said. "I talked to a lot of people because I was very nervous about doing this 
thing. I didn't know if it was right or what. It was definitely not a women's 
lib movement thing at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sherk's reception here is starkly different from what Kibsey got in 1986. 
Kibsey, an assistant pro at St. Boniface Golf Club in Winnipeg, said Friday 
that she has nothing but bad memories from her experience at barrier-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were not happy with my entering the event," she said in a 
phone interview. "They said they thought I was being a little facetious." 
</P>
<P>
Kibsey said she entered because there were not many options for professional 
women golfers in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she felt snubbed at the tournament, Kibsey said: "Let's put it this 
way. If I hadn't been in the tournament, it would have been OK by them. They 
put up with me. No one went out of his way to make me feel welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Sherk wants no part of that action. She has been accommodating with reporters, 
and there have been many, but she doesn't care to be singled out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the only person at this tournament," she said. "I wish everyone would 
also pay attention to the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
Sherk, who turned pro at 29 after winning the World, Canadian and U.S. amateur 
titles, still retains her LPGA card but is non-exempt, which means she must 
qualify for each tournament in which she plays. When she was playing regularly, 
from 1979 to 1984, her husband and son traveled with her. 
</P>
<P>
"We took Chris with us when he was 4 years old," she said. "We got a trailer 
and a truck and off we went to tour the countryside for a year. We found every 
zoo and every park from Los Angeles to New York City. It was a great experience 
for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sherk says, she plays only a few LPGA events a year. By allowing her to 
play here, the tournament organizers have used "a liberal interpretation of 
what an Open is," said Bob Beauchemin, the commissioner of the Canadian Tour, 
which governs both male and female professional golfers in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a loophole there, and each event can put its own conditions on 
entry," he said from Toronto. "I have mixed feelings on it. There are a lot of 
people interested in Cathy playing and that inadvertently helps expansion of 
the game. On the flip side, I cannot imagine a woman playing in the PGA." 
</P>
<P>
Sherk, who has tried to make this clear again and again, has no interest in 
playing on a men's tour. She simply wanted to play at this course. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many expectations of doing well in this tournament," she said. 
"I knew that if I played lights out, I'd be in at 150. I know these guys are 
fantastic. There's no way I had even an expectation of making the cut unless I 
just put two rounds together that were just dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
There were no explosions from Sherk here, but, apparently, that's the way she 
wanted it.

A FALSE START FORCES JAGER OUT AS BIONDI WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympian Matt Biondi and a depleted field of challengers left the starting 
blocks for the 50-meter freestyle Friday night to a chorus of boos -- a first 
for Biondi after all his years of international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the standing-room-only crowd of 2,500 attending the Phillips 66/U.S. 
Swimming Long Course National Championships at USC were expressing their 
disappointment because the meet's premier event was altered when Tom Jager was 
disqualified for a false start. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, swimming in his first major meet since winning seven medals in the 1988 
Olympic Games, was disappointed, too. After winning the national title in the 
50, Biondi said: "I've never felt so empty about a victory. I think I felt the 
same way most of the people felt. 
</P>
<P>
"When the race was over, I think there were about four people clapping. 
Everybody else was sitting there thinking, 'We got robbed.' This was not what I 
came here for." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi came here to swim against Jager, the one swimmer who has beaten him 
often at this distance. 
</P>
<P>
He came to revitalize their rivalry. He and Jager -- the silver medalist at 
Seoul -- have been trying to attract attention to their sport, and they finally 
had drummed up interest. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were on their feet and cheering when the swimmers walked onto the 
deck, but silent for the start. Then, as the eight swimmers left the blocks, 
the starter beeped, signaling a false start. 
</P>
<P>
There were groans as the swimmers made their way back to the blocks. But the 
groans became shouts of protest when referee Annalise Eggert walked down the 
line behind the swimmers, passed Jager, and then turned around and came back to 
tab him as the one who was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
While Jager argued, the crowd broke into a chant: "Let him swim! Let him swim! 
Let him swim." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like that," Biondi said. "I thought we were going to 
have anarchy. It was obvious that everyone wanted him to be there. But these 
things happen in sport. We're all human. We can all make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Eggert might have made a mistake. A TV replay showed that if anyone went early, 
it was Steve Crocker, in Lane 5. Jager was in Lane 4. 
</P>
<P>
Crocker said he didn't go early. He believes he just had a wonderful start. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi suggested that swimming officials should consider using the instant 
replay as does the National Football League when a call comes into question. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who said he has not been disqualified for a false start in at least 12 
years, did nothing unusual on his start. And when Jager reviewed the videotape, 
he thought everyone was still. The rule states there can be no movement. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Jager spoke with reporters, he had cooled considerably. Jay 
Fitzgerald, coach of Jager's Santa Clara Swim Team, had stopped him in the 
hallway to suggest using restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Jager is a competitor who relies heavily on his psyche. This time, all that 
pent-up energy was initially unleashed in the direction of Eggert. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably should apologize for some of the things I said," Jager said. "I was 
pretty keyed up. I'm not proud of the things I said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't take back anything about the way they've got to learn to start 
the race. They have eight big guys up there about to make a decision by 
hundredths of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Jager said that he didn't expect to be disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"She passed me up and I didn't really think about it, but when she started 
coming back, everyone had to be scared. She was just as scared as anyone. . . . 
Once she made a decision, more than anything, she didn't want to back down from 
her original decision." 
</P>
<P>
On the restart, Todd Pace was disqualified for a false start. 
</P>
<P>
The six swimmers left were cautious during the third start. Still, Biondi was 
pleased with his winning time of 22.36 seconds -- not bad considering that he 
had started serious training only six weeks ago, after leaving the national 
water polo team. The time was a pool record, but it fell short of his 
22.14-second swim in Seoul, which broke Jager's world record and earned the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Crocker was second in 22.47. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Biondi nor Jager will represent the United States in the 50 at the Pan 
Pacific Games. Biondi has scheduling conflicts and will not attend. And now 
Jager isn't qualified to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Jager will, however, swim the 50 in the preliminary heats in Tokyo in what the 
swimmers call their "money swim." If he doesn't keep himself ranked in the top 
six in the world, he loses training money. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't break the world record," Biondi told him. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. There will be other high-profile matchups of the world's best 
sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
As Biondi reminded everyone: "We have a special event here, probably the most 
exciting event in swimming. Tom and I have one of the best rivalries in all 
sports. Anything can happen on any day." 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, nothing happens, as was the case in the national final. And 
heavyweight boxing fans thought they got robbed when the last Mike Tyson fight 
was called after 93 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jager returned later in the evening to anchor the men's 400-meter medley relay 
for Santa Clara, which was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Longhorn Aquatics ran away with team honors, winning both the men's and women's 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The men's high-point winner was Dave Wharton of USC and Team Foxcatcher. 
Wharton added the men's 200-meter individual medley title Friday night to 
finish ahead of Dan Jorgensen of USC and the Blue Fins Swim Club. Dan was more 
than 11 seconds behind his brother, Lars, in the men's 1,500-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans of the Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team won her fourth national title 
of the meet and broke the pool record that Tiffany Cohen set during the 1984 
Olympic Games, taking the women's 800-meter freestyle in 8:22.11. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds the world record of 8:17.12, a mark she set early in 1988 before 
winning the gold medal in the event.

OLD FACE, NEW CAP CAN'T SLOW DOWN DAVIS, ANGELS 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time the Angels faced Jerry Reuss, the veteran left-hander held them 
to four hits in a Chicago White Sox victory five days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night in Milwaukee's County Stadium, Reuss was in a different uniform, 
and the Angel hitters, notably Chili Davis, treated him with considerably less 
respect. Davis belted a pair of two-run home runs, and Wally Joyner hit another 
homer as the Angels won their third game in a row, 6-2, before 27,596. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who arrived here at 6 a.m., CDT, after a late-night flight from 
Seattle, dispelled fears of another loss to the much-traveled 40-year-old 
pitcher by scoring five times in the first three innings. Starter Chuck Finley 
and reliever Willie Fraser then kept the Brewers at bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Things change," Manager Doug Rader said. "I said all along the key to hitting 
off Jerry is to lay off the cut fastball inside. Overall, our hitters did 
adjust well." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has five consecutive multiple-hit games and six home runs with 16 
RBIs in his last 14 games, said he didn't make any adjustments. He said he is 
simply riding a hot streak and trying not to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't try to analyze it," he said. "Actually, I wish I could analyze it and 
bottle it up, then every time I needed it, I could go back to that bottle." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who increased their major leagues-leading homer total to 109, 
probably wish they could keep some of their power on the shelf for later use. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said he was glad to get a few runs in a hurry this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland had won, 5-3, and it was posted up there on the board," he said. "If 
you let this team linger close, they're explosive enough to come back and beat 
you. We wanted to score early." 
</P>
<P>
Davis wasn't the only one glad to see the Angels get some runs in a hurry. 
Finley, who improved to 13-7, equaling the most victories by an Angel pitcher 
last season, has been nursing a sore spot next to the fingernail of his left 
middle finger. And he figured he wasn't going to be around for the end. He gave 
up three hits and two runs in the five innings and also walked five. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pride myself on going five innings," he said, "but I wanted to get the 
five and let someone else have it. The way this team is swinging the bat, you 
don't want to walk away from a win. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those nights when you thank God for the offense and get out. I 
guess it's a new kind of hit-and-run." 
</P>
<P>
Rader turned the ball over to Fraser, who picked up his first save of the 
season by holding the Brewers to a pair of singles in the final four innings. 
</P>
<P>
After pitching in the mid-80-degree heat and near 100% humidity, Fraser managed 
a weary smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave just about everything I had left to (final batter) Jimmy Gantner," he 
said. "If he didn't hit that ground ball, I might have been in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers were the ones in trouble from the outset, due primarily to former 
Angel Gus Polidor. 
</P>
<P>
The first two times the Brewer shortstop touched the ball, he threw it five 
feet the head of first baseman Greg Brock. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the first inning, Johhny Ray hit a grounder that Polidor 
fielded and fired past Brock as Ray went to second base. Davis then hit his 
first homer, a drive to center. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Lance Parrish led off with a single to center field. 
Claudell Washington hit a nubber back to Reuss, who threw to Polidor to force 
Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Polidor somehow managed to come up with a live-action instant replay of his 
first throw, and Washington ended up on second. Dick Schofield followed with a 
double down the left-field line, and the Angels had a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Ray's single to left in the third, Davis made the score 5-0 R with his 
17th homer of the season, lining a shot into the bleachers in left. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who yielded a walk in each of the first four innings, finally paid the 
price in the fourth. He walked Brock, and then Joey Meyer got the first Brewer 
hit of the game, a 415-foot home run to center. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't hurt to throw the fastball, but the curve and the forkball both roll 
off that finger, and it was burning," said Finley, who first realized he had 
the injury when he woke up with a throbbing finger Sunday night after his last 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"I was starting to change my mechanics because of it and I was all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said he doesn't think the injury will force him to miss a start because 
it had been improving before Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the abbreviated night's sleep left him feeling a little like the 
morning of "one of those off-season golf tournaments when you party until 4 and 
then get up for a 7 a.m. tee time." 
</P>
<P>
If that was the case, he still shot a nice round. But there was nothing below 
par about his performance or that of the Angels, who have won 13 of their last 
17 games. 
</P>
<P>
They rebounded from a seven-game losing streak in mid-July to win seven in a 
row. And after losing three consecutive games last week, they have reeled off 
three victories. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we're where we're at," Davis said. "You can't be a winning team 
when you lose more games than you win." 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe he does need some sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
There's been a lot of talk about the Angels' pitching and power, but Kirk 
McCaskill thinks that Manager Doug Rader has had as much to do with the Angels' 
winning ways as any player. "A lot of it is a direct result of the manager," he 
said. "We're very lucky to have Doug. I read the stories about his problems 
(dealing with players) in Texas and I find it hard to believe. He knows how to 
handle us, personally and as a team. He's the best thing that's ever happened 
to the Angels." McCaskill, comparing Rader to former Angel Manager Gene Mauch, 
said Mauch "managed by intimidation" and Rader is "a people manager." "Both 
styles work, but who would you rather work for?" McCaskill asked. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White, who had played in every game this season but one, sat out No. 2 
Friday night because of a sinus and throat infection. Trainer Ned Bergert said 
White is taking antibiotics. White said he was available for service if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
After two days off, the slumping Brian Downing was back in the lineup Friday 
night. Downing, who had not missed consecutive games since Aug. 21-22 of 1987, 
was batting leadoff, but the switch in the order didn't help. He was hitless in 
four at-bats with three strikeouts and has four hits in his last 40 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bill Schroeder, whose daughter, Lindsey, remains in a suburban 
Milwaukee hospital with an ear infection, spent Friday with his family. "He 
went straight to the hospital as soon as we landed this morning (at 6 a.m.)," 
Rader said. "He called me and said she was doing a little better and said he'd 
be here by game time."

MANDATORY TITLE DEFENSE WON'T UPSET TYSON'S TIMETABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Earl Gustkey

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few things were left unsaid during Don King's monologue Thursday night at the 
Beverly Hills Hotel, where he filled in the names on Mike Tyson's boxing 
calendar and lauded a Japanese automaker for signing the heavyweight champion 
to make commercials. 
</P>
<P>
King, Tyson's promoter, said Tyson's next five opponents, in probable order, 
would be Michael Dokes, Buster Douglas, Razor Ruddock, George Foreman and 
Evander Holyfield. He also said Tyson would be paid in "seven figures" by the 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
What he didn't say was that the arrangement was set up by Tyson's now-estranged 
manager, Bill Cayton. 
</P>
<P>
Also left unsaid was that Tyson has a mandatory defense of his World Boxing 
Assn. championship coming up, a defense that must be signed for by Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The WBA "requires" its champions to fight the top-ranked contenders within one 
year. The WBA's No. 1 challenger is Holyfield. So what happens if Tyson fights 
Dokes, No. 10, and Buster Douglas, No. 8, instead? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, no sweat. Remember, this is pro boxing, folks. Because nearly everyone in 
the business considers the ratings a joke anyway -- for example, the World 
Boxing Council does not rank Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation 
champion, among the world's top 30 middleweights. 
</P>
<P>
All King has to do is make one phone call and, presto! Mandatory defense 
postponed. Indefinitely. When you control the heavyweight champion, hearts and 
minds follow. 
</P>
<P>
Also left unsaid: King wants to promote Tyson-Holyfield by himself, not with 
Dan Duva, who is Holyfield's promoter. He is hoping that Holyfield and his 
manager, Ken Sanders, will tire of waiting for the big fight and leave Duva for 
King. 
</P>
<P>
All this is yet another argument for the creation of a strong boxing 
commission, one that would yank this kind of manipulative power from the hands 
of promoters. 
</P>
<P>
In a perfect world, a champion fights the No. 1 guy or he's stripped of his 
championship, period. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, both King and Duva eventually might regret not putting this one 
together as quickly as possible. Jim Jacobs, Tyson's late co-manager, once 
talked about timing in moving a fighter into big-money fights. 
</P>
<P>
"In pro boxing, the idea is to maximize your opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you know your fighter is ready for that career-making fight that you've 
been moving him toward, then you get him that fight as soon as you can get it. 
Remember, strange things happen. Someone could get run over by a bus." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Mastro, longtime Southland boxing statistician, has accused promoter Don 
Chargin and the Forum of promoting main events with fighters bearing phony 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The fighters in question, Santos Moreno and Sergio Perez, both are from Mexico. 
They lost to Los Angeles area boxers Hector Lopez and Paul Gonzales on the same 
day, July 31. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll offer $500 to anyone who can produce evidence that Santos Moreno had a 
47-17 record when he fought Lopez and I'll offer $500 to anyone who presents 
proof that Sergio Perez was 19-9-1 when he fought Gonzales," Mastro said. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I can't find a Sergio Perez anywhere in my records. It hurts me, to 
see phony records issued by promoters and to see the press use them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mastro for years has kept records of Southland boxers. So does Dean Lohuis, who 
charts the careers of about 2,500 pro boxers. He disputes Mastro's claims. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that with some Mexican fighters, it's hard to verify records, but 
just because Dick Mastro misses some results is no reason to throw the word 
phony around. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got results for 56 Moreno fights, and 19 of them were held in the U.S. 
This one is not difficult. He's a legitimate, 10-round main-event fighter. 
There are two Santos Morenos in my records, and Dick might be confusing him 
with the Santos Moreno who did lose a lot of fights."

Rob Lynch of the California Athletic Commission said Mexican boxers are 
required to present a Mexican boxing license with a certified record of recent 
bouts attached to it when signing for a California fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Both those guys seemed to have their paper work in order, both had their 
pictures on their licenses, and we had no reason to question their 
backgrounds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one in Reno seems worried about the Texas judge who granted a temporary 
restraining order to halt the Michael Nunn-Iran Barkley middleweight fight Aug. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Al Boulden, a former trainer for Barkely, is seeking $47,000 he says Barkley 
owes him, plus $50,000 he would earn for the Nunn fight. State District judge 
Jack O'Neill granted the order Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of things happen in boxing all the time," said Dan Goossen, Nunn's 
manager. "The worst thing that happens is that the fight goes on and Barkley's 
purse is frozen, until he solves his problem with this guy."

Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
How is it possible that Frankie Duarte qualifies for a WBC super-bantamweight 
title fight against Daniel Zaragoza at the Forum Aug. 31? Duarte has as much 
business in a championship fight as Richard Simmons. Duarte is ranked 16th 
among WBC bantamweights, which is a gift. He's also 35. In his most recent 
fights, he has struggled to beat three club fighters, whose records are 
25-21-1, 18-13-3 and 9-10-1. For shame, Jerry Buss! 
</P>
<P>
Remember the dreaded Dutchman, Rogelio Tuur? He's the featherweight who iced 
America's Kelcie Banks with one right hand at the Seoul Olympics. He made his 
pro debut at Madison Square Garden recently and scored a first-round knockout.

GRETZKY IS ON ROAD TO EVERYWHERE; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS' STAR STILL FACING SPLIT-LOYALTY SCENES IN EDMONTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since last he skated for the Kings, Wayne Gretzky has been to Europe, where he 
invested in a horse; to New York, where he was host of "Saturday Night Live;" 
to Toronto, where he was honored as the most valuable player in the National 
Hockey League; to Las Vegas, where he attended the Victor Awards; home to 
Ontario, for his charity softball game; back to Los Angeles, where he played 
host to a couple of vacationing Edmonton Oilers; to Victoria, Canada, for 
another charity appearance, and back to Los Angeles where, Friday, he started 
his day as a KIIS-FM guest disc jockey alongside Rick Dees. 
</P>
<P>
From there, it was on to the Forum to talk with a small group of reporters 
about last summer's trade from the Oilers to the Kings, a trade that ranks 
among the biggest in the history of sport and is still being felt -- throughout 
the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky calls it a trade that "definitely helped hockey." 
</P>
<P>
It definitely helped hockey in Los Angeles. But it didn't do much for Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Edmonton would have traded me to L.A. if they had thought I 
would come back to haunt them," Gretzky said Friday. "In that, I think I was 
underestimated as a hockey player. They didn't think L.A. could compete the way 
we did." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky remembers the weeks before the trade as "an emotional time . . . a hard 
time . . . a fun time." 
</P>
<P>
And it led into an emotional, hard, fun hockey season. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is hoping that this season will be a little easier, with less emphasis 
on his change of allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
But before he skates for the Kings again, he has another of those emotional 
scenes to face in Edmonton where, on Aug. 27, he will attend the unveiling of a 
bronze statue of himself outside the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It's a statue of Gretzky in an Edmonton Oiler uniform holding the Stanley Cup 
over his head. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky struggles with these split-loyalty scenes. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he said that the exhibition game in Edmonton Sept. 22 might be one 
that he sits out. 
</P>
<P>
According to NHL rules, players can appear in only eight exhibitions and the 
Kings have 11. That means the fans in three cities are going to be sorely 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The trade has had a profound effect on the Kings' training camp and exhibition 
schedule. According to King Vice President Roy Mlakar, camp and the exhibition 
season used to cost the Kings more than $250,000. Now, they will make almost $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the months of January and February entertaining offers from promoters 
throughout North America who wanted a game," Mlakar said. "It's big business 
now. I tried to put the games in big buildings. In Milwaukee, they have already 
sold 17,000 tickets at an average price of $20. . . . The promoter in Cleveland 
has already sold 10,000 tickets at an average price of $25. We anticipate a 
sellout in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if we sell out every game." 
</P>
<P>
It also will be no surprise if the Kings open the regular season with a string 
of sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
At some point early in the season, Gretzky will break the all-time scoring 
record set by his longtime idol, Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 points. Gretzky 
is only 14 points away from that. 
</P>
<P>
The record will mean that the focus will stay on Gretzky for a while, even 
though he's hoping for a little break sometime soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a hectic, tough year last year because it was a new 
thing for everybody," Gretzky said. " . . . Obviously it will be a lot easier 
for me this year. It's not as new. The excitement will have died down a lot." 
</P>
<P>
But the excitement over the scoring record? 
</P>
<P>
"That's the fun part of the game," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Glenn Healy, a free agent with compensation, is not likely to be back 
with the Kings next season. He is expected to sign with another team, possibly 
the New Jersey Devils, early next week. . . . John Tonelli, the only other King 
whose contract is still unsettled, is expected to reach an agreement with the 
team soon.

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. has informed the University of Arizona 
that it has not reached a decision regarding the eligibility of Chris Mills, 
former Fairfax High School star who transferred from Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Council, meeting in San Diego, told the university that it was 
referring the matter to the Infractions Committee for review later this month. 
Arizona officials sent the NCAA an appeal in late July asking that Mills, a 
6-foot-7 swingman, be declared eligible for the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, a key figure in the NCAA's recent investigation of Kentucky, was 
declared ineligible at Kentucky earlier this year after the NCAA had levied 
sanctions against the Wildcats. The NCAA found that Dwane Casey, former 
Kentucky assistant coach, had sent $1,000 to Mills' father, Claud, during the 
recruiting of Chris Mills.

NEWSWIRE: LAKERS SIGN DREW; LAMP TO JOIN ITALIAN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers gained one guard and lost another Friday when they signed former 
Clipper Larry Drew to a multiyear contract and veteran Jeff Lamp signed to play 
with the Reyer team of Venice, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Drew, 31, is a 6-foot-2 free agent who averaged 23 points and five assists with 
Pesaro Scavollini of the Italian League last season. He is an eight-year 
National Basketball Assn. veteran who played his last two seasons in the NBA 
with the Clippers, averaging 10.3 points and 5.2 assists in 74 games in 
1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased to welcome Larry back to the NBA and feel he will be a 
valuable member of our team," General Manager Jerry West said. "He is a 
talented, experienced player who can play either guard position and should give 
us more versatility." 
</P>
<P>
Lamp, 30, appeared in 37 regular-season games for the Lakers last season and 
averaged 1.6 points. This will be his second season in Italy. He also played 
with Rimini in 1986-87 before signing with the Lakers.

HALL OF FAME GAME;

SHELL, THREE OTHER SUPER BOWL STARS WILL BE INDUCTED TODAY

Four men, 12 Super Bowl rings. 
</P>
<P>
That alone illustrates the formidable talent being inducted into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got representatives of the best teams of the 1960s and the 1970s," said 
Terry Bradshaw, the former Pittsburgh quarterback who enters the hall with 
teammate Mel Blount. Each owns an unprecedented four Super Bowl rings from the 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
"It speaks well for what athletes are taught. You're told to win and then 
you're judged on how much you win," Bradshaw said. "It's not personal 
accomplishments or statistics. America loves winners." 
</P>
<P>
Also entering the hall are tackle Art Shell of the Oakland and Los Angeles 
Raiders and safety Willie Wood of the Green Bay Packers, each of whom has two 
championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
As for the exhibition game that accompanies induction ceremonies, Washington's 
Doug Williams won't play at all, and Buffalo's Jim Kelly will see only limited 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 34, has been in traction for a back injury but will not need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
In Williams' place, Washington Coach Joe Gibbs will use Mark Rypien and Stan 
Humphries. Veteran Bill Kenney, signed as a free agent, also is expected to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to play their first game in Redskin uniforms are running backs Gerald 
Riggs and Earnest Byner. Riggs, formerly with the Atlanta Falcons, and Byner, a 
starter with the Cleveland Browns, were obtained in draft-day trades. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo Coach Marv Levy will give Kelly, Frank Reich, Stan Gelbaugh and Gale 
Gilbert playing time at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills will be without Pro Bowl defensive end Bruce Smith, who is nursing a 
thigh injury. Three other Bills remain out of camp in contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are coming off a 12-4 season that took them to the AFC Championship 
game, while the Redskins were 7-9.

WEEKEND RACING AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
METTEE SEEKS AN ENCORE IN SAN DIEGO HANDICAP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Mettee has an impossible act to follow. The only other time the 
31-year-old trainer had anything to do with the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar, 
he was involved with Bates Motel, who made a shambles of the 1983 running of 
the 1 1/16-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mettee will try to return to the winner's circle after the $132,450 San 
Diego Handicap with Hot Operator, a 4-year-old bay colt who has yet to win a 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 16, the son of Well 
Decorated finished second, beating favored Ruhlmann in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Rahy, the Bel Air winner, ran the mile in 1:33 to beat Hot Operator by 10 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure Hot Operator paid much attention to Rahy," Mettee said at his Del 
Mar office Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"My colt came from pretty far back, and by the time he was making his move for 
second, Rahy was long gone. Hot Operator may have even thought he won the race, 
if horses actually think in those terms." 
</P>
<P>
Hot Operator began his career with four straight seconds, then broke his maiden 
at Del Mar last Sept. 5. Since then, the colt has won three races and placed in 
two stakes, while finishing worse than third only once in 12 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd describe him as a very athletic horse, with good, sound legs and a pretty 
good temperament -- for a colt," said Mettee. 
</P>
<P>
Mettee learned his trade as John Gosden's assistant trainer for eight years. 
When Gosden returned to his native England to train for Sheikh Mohammed al 
Maktoum at the end of 1988, Mettee went into business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The low-key, unassuming Baltimore native retained several of Gosden's best 
horses and top clients, among them Herbert Allen, who bought Hot Operator at a 
Florida auction in 1987 for $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I can recall, Allen has never seen the horse run," Mettee said. 
"He's not the type of owner who needs to know how a horse worked, or if he 
cleaned up his feed. But he's always interested in their well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I call his office in New York I'm told he's tied up. When I leave my 
name they ask me to wait, then he comes right to the phone. Apparently I'm on 
the right list." 
</P>
<P>
Only five horses have been entered in the San Diego, and none live up to the 
quality of such recent winners as Cutlass Reality, Skywalker and Super Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One, from the Charlie Whittingham stable, will carry top weight of 120 
pounds, but the horse Mettee fears most is the Argentine 5-year-old Monte 
Simon, trained by Neil Drysdale and leased by Drysdale's wife, Inger. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field includes Mi Preferido, who is looking for his first 
victory since the San Fernando Stakes Jan. 15, and Splendor Catch, who has won 
three of his last four races on turf but none on dirt since November of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Hawkster and Notorious Pleasure sitting it out, Sunday's $110,200 La Jolla 
Handicap has the look of a runoff for third-best local grass 3-year-old. 
Exemplary Leader, winner of the slower Oceanside Stakes division on opening 
day, will be joined by stablemate Broke the Mold. Double Found, Trebizond, 
Tenacious Tom, Tokatee and Art Work all have a chance, but the wild card is 
River Master, an improving son of His Majesty from Charlie Whittingham's barn. 
. . . Rick Mettee reports that Annoconnor came out of her disappointing fourth 
in the Palomar Handicap July 29 in need of a rest. The 5-year-old mare will be 
out until the fall.

L.A. CITY TEAM TRIES TO BREAK 2-GAME LOSING STREAK

The San Diego Section's high school all-star football team will try to gain its 
third consecutive victory over the Los Angeles City Section tonight at 7:30 in 
the third Hall of Champions football game at Torrey Pines High School. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles hopes to regain the dominance it enjoyed before the game was 
discontinued in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, San Diego edged Los Angeles on a last-second, 39-yard field goal by 
Torrey Pines' Tim Walker, 17-14. In 1987, when the series was resumed, San 
Diego took a 19-0 lead but needed a 49-yard touchdown pass from Maurice Jackson 
of Madison to Johnny Ace of Valhalla with less than three minutes left to win, 
26-19. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, coached by Brad Ratcliff of University High and Tom Hernandez of 
San Fernando, has a quick backfield. Dorsey's Wilson Bryant, the state 
400-meter champion who will attend the University of Washington, will join 
Washington's Takim Brown, Crenshaw's Shon Ellerbe and Banning's Keith Mims in 
the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Banning, the Los Angeles City 4-A runner-up, has seven players on the 38-man 
roster: Mims, defensive backs Eric Williams and Paul Montgomery, receiver 
Johnny Lawrence and linemen Andy Gonzalez, Paul Ordonez and Bryan Proby. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, which defeated Banning for the 4-A title, 55-7, has three players -- 
linebackers Peter Hunt and Todd Auvaa and defensive back Greg Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Foster, who led Dorsey to its best season in nearly a decade, will split 
quarterback duties with Kennedy's Tony Smets. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego will rely on passing, coaches Rik Haines of Torrey Pines and Dick 
Haines of Vista said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Cree Morris and receiver Jake Nyberg, who will attend San Diego 
State, were effective at Orange Glen last fall. While guiding the Patriots to 
the San Diego 3-A championship game, Nyberg led the state in receiving with 93 
catches for 1,456 yards. Morris was third in the state with 3,212 yards 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego also will be led by Southwest receiver Will Tate and Torrey Pines 
quarterback John Lynch.

FIRST TEST TO DIRECTLY FIND AIDS VIRUS APPROVED

<P>
The first lab test that can directly detect the AIDS virus has been approved by 
the federal government, the test manufacturer announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The new test directly detects a minimum of one of the virus' antigens or 
proteins, whereas other tests search for antibodies, which do not appear until 
somewhat later. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration gave Abbott Laboratories the go-ahead to 
market the test after several medical journals published studies showing that 
it could help doctors diagnose the human immunodeficiency virus and forecast 
how the disease will progress in a given patient. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell by tracking the levels of the antigen how seriously the disease 
is going to progress," said Catherine Babington, spokeswoman for Abbott. Also, 
"it allows us to track the effectiveness of various treatments for AIDS," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Detection of Infection 
</P>
<P>
Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., the New 
England Journal of Medicine, the British journal Lancet and the British Medical 
Journal has shown that the HIV antigen sometimes can be detected before 
antibodies form. Those detected with the antigen often have acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or other forms of immune deficiency, and detecting the 
antigen helps in treating those infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Antigens are toxic particles and part of the virus. When the virus strikes, the 
body's immune system produces antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
"HIV antigens can appear temporarily as early as two weeks after infection, 
whereas antibodies are first detectable within six to 10 weeks," said Dr. 
Harold Kessler, director of the HIV treatment program at Chicago's Rush 
Presbyterian Medical Center.

NUCLEUS GROUP OF 10 NAMED TO FACULTY AT CAL STATE SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first 10 faculty members at the new state university in San Marcos were 
named Friday by President Bill Stacy, a core group of academicians who will 
define the university's scholastic mission and, from the outset, brand it with 
at least two areas of speciality. 
</P>
<P>
One of the incoming professors has established a research center on 
gerontology, which he will relocate to San Marcos, and another is developing a 
library of Spanish-language literature for children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
The charter faculty members were enlisted from such places as Stanford 
University, the University of Illinois, Pomona College, the University of 
California at Irvine, and from three campuses within the California State 
University system: Chico, Fresno and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The founding faculty also represent a San Diego flavor of sorts. One of Stacy's 
hires, Isabel Schon, a professor of reading education and library science at 
Arizona State University, maintains a home in La Jolla. Another, Patricia 
Worden, who is chairman of the department of psychology at Cal State Fullerton, 
earned her Ph.D from UC San Diego and lives in Del Mar with her husband, 
attorney Dwight Worden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'As Good as Any' 
</P>
<P>
"This group is as good as any faculty nucleus that could be found in the 
nation," said Stacy. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 were culled from more than 1,270 applicants from around the country who 
sought the tenured faculty positions at the new university, which will field 
its first classes in 13 months in temporary classrooms until the campus' first 
permanent structures are completed by the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The new faculty members will begin work in San Marcos in early September, and 
be paid from $60,000 to $64,000 a year -- the upper limit for professors in the 
CSU system. They are: 
</P>
<P>
* Therese Baker, director of the urban studies program at De Paul University 
before moving eight months ago to Stanford, where she is assistant to the vice 
provost. Baker has a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
* Larry Cohen, a professor in an endowed chair in biology at Pomona College 
near Los Angeles and a specialist in genetic engineering who also has taught at 
Rutgers University and UCLA, where he earned his doctorate in biology. 
</P>
<P>
* Joan Gunderson, a professor of colonial and American history at St. Olaf 
College in Minnesota, where she is also the director of women's studies. She 
earned her doctorate in history from Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
* Bernard Hinton, a professor of organizational behavior and management at Cal 
State Chico and a former professor at Indiana University. Hinton got his 
doctorate in management from Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
* William Liu, now a distinguished professor and director of the Asian-American 
Research Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He earned his 
doctorate in sociology from Florida State University and is establishing a 
research center in Hong Kong on the aging of the Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
* Newton Marguiles, a former dean and now a professor of management at UC 
Irvine's graduate school of management. He got his doctorate in engineering 
management from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
* Kenneth Brooks Reid, chairman of the department of mathematics at Louisiana 
State University, who also has taught at The Johns Hopkins University. He got 
his doctorate in mathematics from the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
* Isabel Schon, professor of reading education and library science at Arizona 
State University, who earned a doctorate in elementary education and reading 
from the University of Colorado and who wants to establish the Spanish-language 
library in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
* Kenneth Seib, chairman of the department of English at Cal State Fresno, who 
was a Fulbright professor of American literature at universities in West 
Germany and Norway. He got his doctorate in English from the University of 
Pittsburgh and did post-doctorate work at UC San Diego in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
* Patricia Worden, now chairman of the department of psychology at Cal State 
Fullerton. She earned her doctorate in experimental psychology from UC San 
Diego, where she had a postdoctoral fellowship at its Center for Human 
Information Processing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stacy said Friday, he hired Dorothy Lloyd, a professor of 
education at San Francisco State University, to serve as a consultant to him on 
curriculum development in education. Lloyd had not originally applied during 
the search process for the core faculty and was specifically recruited by Stacy 
for the job. She earned her doctorate in education at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Stacy hired Marian Reid, the former associate director of the 
Louisiana State University Library, as interim director of the new university's 
library. 
</P>
<P>
Of the dozen hired by Stacy to help develop the university's curriculum and 
scholastic reputation, six are women and three are members of ethnic 
minorities: a Chinese, a Latino and a black. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy said he hopes to hire, within days, two more core faculty members with 
specialities in education -- one from the University of South Carolina and one 
from UC Riverside. Both are women, and one is black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As Good as a UC Faculty 
</P>
<P>
Stacy said he also is looking to hire consultants in specific areas of science, 
engineering and the fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
"This group is better than I had hoped for," Stacy said of his first dozen. 
"We've pulled together faculty who are not only typical of the best professors 
in a system like ours, but are as good as a UC faculty where the focus is on 
research and professional degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Between them, they've written nearly 150 scholarly books, literally hundreds 
of juried or refereed journal articles and hundreds of scholarly presentations 
to national conferences. They've held nearly 50 editorships of major journals 
and represent 80 terms of leadership in learned societies." 
</P>
<P>
Those professors who could be reached Friday for comment echoed the sentiment 
offered by Baker, reached at her office at Stanford: 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous opportunity to start a new university. There aren't many 
chances like this." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that, with proper planning, Cal State San Marcos should be able to 
develop a curriculum most appropriate for the community and California's 
changing demographics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at a major institution -- Stanford -- that is having to refashion itself 
in several ways to address concerns about how effectively it is serving 
minority students. But San Marcos can start from the beginning in recognizing 
it will have a large number of minority students. We can build a curriculum and 
a faculty to address those issues right from the start," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is also interested in how higher education can better address the 
specific challenges presented by women and older students as well as whether 
universities should prepare students in liberal arts or for specific careers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Issues 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kinds of central issues that will be critical as we establish 
the new university," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Schon called her appointment to the new university "the most exciting thing in 
my life, although there's always apprehension when you start something new." 
</P>
<P>
Schon said she plans to continue a project she started at Arizona State to 
develop what may become the world's largest collection of Spanish-language 
literature for young readers. It is to be made available as references, 
research or possibly for lending. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as two years ago, children could not check out books from the 
children's section at the National Public Library in Mexico City," she said. 
"School libraries in Mexico are non-existent, and most children cannot afford 
to buy their own books." 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos collection, she suggested, will be made available to teachers, 
parents, researchers and other librarians who, in turn, can then order specific 
copies of what they like from the publishers. The books would not only be 
valuable to Spanish-speaking readers, but of use to the English-speaking who 
are learning to speak and read Spanish and are searching for reading material 
other than Spanish-language magazines and textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Cohen was on a genetic engineering research trip to the Netherlands and 
could not be reached Friday for comment. But his wife, Eleanor, who served on 
the Claremont City Council for 10 years -- two as its mayor -- and who is on 
the faculty of UCLA's public policy program, said she is ready to move to San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already in escrow on a home in Vista," she said. "We used to live in 
Pacific Beach years ago, and it's exciting to be moving back to the county. The 
place has grown."

HE WAS IN A PICKLE, AND JOAN KROC HELPED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not every day that somebody gets a present in the mail from Joan Kroc, and 
it's probably the first time that San Diego's best-known philanthropist has 
sent a 5-gallon jar of pickles to somebody she doesn't even know. 
</P>
<P>
But when Joseph Ditler, 37, arrived at his doorstep in Coronado Friday 
afternoon, he found a jar of pickles as big as a small child. It had a red 
ribbon affixed to it, and, of course, a note from "Joan." Kroc's late husband 
was founder and chairman of the board of McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry you're in a pickle about McDonald's pickle policy . . . ," the note 
began, as sympathetic as a Krocian overture to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So how did this all come about? 
</P>
<P>
Ditler, a free-lance boating writer, is a self-described pickle-holic. As a 
child, he said, the only gesture that saved him from self-induced death by 
starvation was getting to smother his hamburgers with pickles. He hated the 
taste of everything but pickles. If you are what you eat, Ditler was, and to 
some extent still is, a blond, blue-eyed pickle. 
</P>
<P>
So, for years, Ditler took to ordering Big Macs at McDonald's restaurants 
around the world. In a variety of languages, he would ask for 12 
</P>
<P>
to 20 extra pickles in the Netherlands, the Caribbean, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
It was more than once that Ditler would look over the counter and announce in 
Spanish with a picklish smile: 
</P>
<P>
"Quiero un pepinillo!" 
</P>
<P>
Translation: "I want a pickle." He would point to the meat of his burger and 
explain that a dozen would "adequately" kill the taste and leave him counting 
his McBlessings. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, Ditler strolled into the McDonald's at 1135 Palm Ave. in 
Imperial Beach. He asked for extra pickles. The manager said no, Ditler said, 
adding sourly that it wasn't the first time. The three that come with a Big Mac 
were just not enough. 
</P>
<P>
So, he sat down and wrote Joan Kroc a letter, appealing to her instincts as a 
peacemaker while trying to sweeten his poison-pickle mood. He mailed the letter 
and, a couple of weeks later, got an answer from Kroc's office. He was asked to 
call a phone number in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
He did so, and that's when he got the dillicious word from a Kroc associate to 
get ready for a nifty surprise. Having read about and admired the famous woman, 
Ditler confessed to cranking up the fantasies. What would the prize be? A 
pickle-colored Porsche? A night on the town with Bip Roberts? A lifetime supply 
of free McDLTs? 
</P>
<P>
No, just pickles. Lots and lots of pickles. 
</P>
<P>
Ditler said the jar contains 6,300 pickles with an expiration date of January, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I'll finish them by then," he said worriedly. "But my wife is 
pregnant, and you know how pregnant women are always craving pickles. So maybe 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
At the McDonald's in Imperial Beach, second assistant manager Debra King had 
apparently heard of Ditler. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything. . . . I can't make any comment at all," she said 
tersely, referring the caller to an office in Chicago, where everyone had left 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Ditler had actually hoped for a "carte blanche" letter from Kroc that he could 
show to any McDonald's employee who might try to muscle their own version of 
the just-say-no philosophy. In her reply, Kroc noted that she is "not involved 
in the operation or management of the McDonald's Corporation," although she is 
on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
So, he would just have to settle for his heart's desire -- more pickles than a 
pickle lover can handle. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc's response on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Kroc has no comment," said an annoyed Chuck Gelman, an executive with the 
Padres, who was delegated the task of speaking for Kroc -- who owns the team -- 
on the pickle issue. "She didn't do this for publicity. She did this for a 
McDonald's customer. She was just trying to make him happy."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BATMAN IN TELEVISION SERIES FILES LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holy mirror image. Former Batman Adam West isn't doing battle with 
supervillains these days. He's fighting another Batman. 
</P>
<P>
West, who portrayed the Caped Crusader in the camp 1960s TV series, is asking 
for more than $9 million in damages from a group of advertising agencies that 
filmed television commercials with a non-West Batman. 
</P>
<P>
West claimed that the other Batman used West's "likeness, personality, voice 
and mannerisms" in a way that would make viewers believe they were watching 
West instead of an imposter. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for West and the agencies appeared before Burbank Superior Court 
Judge Stephen O'Neil on Friday. O'Neil denied a motion from the agencies' 
attorney to dismiss the case and ordered the two sides to appear for trial in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials depict the Batman and Robin characters shopping during the 
Christmas season at Zayer's, a chain of discount stores, Silcott said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second Mediterranean fruit fly has been found in the Silver Lake area, but 
there are no plans to begin aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion, county 
agricultural officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Crews have put up additional traps that they will be check daily, Agricultural 
Commissioner Leon Spaugy said. They also will be sampling home-grown fruit in 
the area for the presence of larvae. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Medfly was trapped Wednesday, 13 days and about 1 1/2 miles from the 
Elysian Park area where the first fly was discovered, Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we get engrossed in a costly eradication project, we want to be certain 
we have an infestation," he said. "If we do pick up additional flies or find 
the presence of larvae, that would change the situation dramatically."

SETTLEMENT WITH DUBOSE'S WIDOW TO COST CITY $218,833 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An out-of-court settlement between the city of San Diego and the widow of a 
Southeast San Diego man slain by police will cost the city $218,833, according 
to documents released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, Mary Dubose, 53, will receive a $20,000 payment and 
$1,200 a month for the rest of her life from an annuity purchased for her by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Tommie Dubose, 56, was shot to death March 12, 1988, during a 
nighttime raid staged by officers who charged into the Dubose home while 
executing a search warrant. While Dubose struggled with one officer, another 
shot him five times. Four of the bullets hit Dubose in the back. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office did not charge Officer Carlos Garcia in the 
case, ruling that he reasonably believed that Dubose had wrested control of the 
other officer's gun. But, in April, 1988, Mary Dubose filed a $15-million claim 
against the city, contending that the shooting of her husband was unnecessary 
and inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. John Witt revealed the terms of the out-of-court settlement Tuesday 
after the City Council approved the deal in closed session. However, Witt 
refused to give the total cost to the city, citing an agreement among the two 
sides and a federal magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
Witt also said that, under an obscure Internal Revenue Service provision, Mary 
Dubose will not have to pay taxes on the money if she is kept ignorant of the 
cost of the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
According to information published on an agenda for next Monday's council 
meeting, the annuity will cost the city $153,833. The city also will pay 
$45,000 in attorney's fees to Mary Dubose's lawyer, James Randall, and the 
$20,000 lump sum to Mary Dubose. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to take a final vote on the settlement in open session 
Monday.

MORE PREGNANT WOMEN DONATING OWN BLOOD; 
</P>
<P>
FEARS OF DISEASES FROM TRANSFUSIONS INCREASES PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As she entered the final month of her pregnancy, Ilene Tindall was well aware 
of the horror stories about hospital patients contracting infectious diseases 
from tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
Like a growing number of pregnant women, Tindall decided that, in the event she 
or her newborn child needed blood during or after delivery, she would feel 
safest knowing that it came from an unquestionable source: herself. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with her obstetrician about the risks involved, Tindall 
readily joined the expanding ranks of pregnant women who, concerned over the 
quality of community blood banks' supply, decide to store their own blood for 
possible use during delivery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Way I Have Peace' 
</P>
<P>
"This blood will be 100% safe," Tindall said shortly before technicians from 
the North County Blood Bank drew her blood at Pomerado Hospital this week. 
"This way, I have peace of mind about the quality of blood." 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of contracting diseases such as AIDS or hepatitis from donors at 
community blood banks, hundreds -- and maybe thousands -- of pregnant women are 
making the same decision as Tindall. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987, member blood banks of the Arlington, Va.-based American Assn. of 
Blood Banks drew 282,856 units of self-donated blood from people facing a 
variety of medical procedures -- more than double the 124,454 units of 
self-donated blood drawn the year before. 
</P>
<P>
That dramatic increase in self-donated blood, blood bankers say, is 
attributable largely to increasing concerns that community blood supplies may 
be tainted by infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the rising interest in so-called "autologous" donations among 
pregnant women, the blood banking community has not yet developed firm 
guidelines on how -- or even whether -- some pregnant mothers should donate 
their own blood. 
</P>
<P>
Because of caution among obstetricians and blood banks about changing past 
practices, autologous blood donations by pregnant women remain "relatively 
rare," according to Dr. Rebecca Flack, assistant medical director of the San 
Diego Blood Bank, which stores blood donated by pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Encouraging 
</P>
<P>
"We do draw blood if they know they're probably going to need it," Flack said. 
"And no one would argue that the safest blood transfusion for both mother and 
fetus is blood that comes from Mom." 
</P>
<P>
Research conducted so far strongly suggests that it is safe for pregnant women 
to donate their own blood for future use, according to Tindall's obstetrician, 
Vivian Ellis, who is on staff at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ellis describes such donations as being compatible with her 
"conservative approach to labor and delivery," the issue of whether pregnant 
women should donate blood is actively debated within the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
A recent blood bank association publication includes sections titled "Should 
Pregnant Patients Be Autologous Blood Donors?" and "Unanswered Questions 
Regarding Safety and Effectiveness" of self-donations by pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that it should not become a commonplace procedure," said Merlin 
Sayers, medical director of the Puget Sound Blood Center in Seattle. "Under 
some (blood banks), it has become a routine procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors worry that the risks faced by pregnant women who donate blood 
outweigh "the risks she's trying to avoid," Sayers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Problems 
</P>
<P>
For example, pregnant women and fetuses might face special problems on the 
"very rare occasions" when donors faint or experience lowered blood pressure or 
a dramatically slowed pulse, Sayers explained. 
</P>
<P>
"While those are very innocuous events for a healthy adult, we (cannot yet) . . 
. say those are innocuous for a woman who is a few weeks away from delivery, or 
for the fetus," Sayers said. 
</P>
<P>
Tindall, whose first child was born nearly two years ago through a Caesarean 
section, opted for an autologous donation because her second child is to be 
delivered by a vaginal birth. She made the decision after discussing the 
possibility with her husband and obstetrician Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis advised Tindall to consider an autologous donation because complications 
can occur when a woman chooses a vaginal birth after a Caesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
But, even though Ellis strongly supported the autologous donation -- as she 
routinely does for mothers who face some risk during delivery -- Tindall 
realized that such donations are not the norm. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister (in Wisconsin) is an OB nurse in delivery, and she had never heard 
of" pregnant women donating blood to be used should a complication arise during 
delivery, Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drawn in Third Trimester 
</P>
<P>
For obstetricians, "the first requirement is a healthy mom and baby," Ellis 
said. The blood usually is drawn during the third trimester because it can be 
stored without freezing -- and delivered immediately should a transfusion 
become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women now account for about 40% of all autologous blood drawn by the 
Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank in Boston, according to Linda Chambers, 
associate medical director of the bank, which has conducted research into 
autologous donations by pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
Interest is high among pregnant women "because they tend to be highly motivated 
and most are acutely aware of any risk to them and their family," Chambers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Israel's blood bank has safely drawn enough blood from healthy, pregnant 
women to erase fears that the procedure is dangerous, Chambers said. 
Consequently, the Boston hospital no longer does in-depth monitoring while 
drawing the blood. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Blood Bank conducts in-depth interviews with pregnant women to 
determine if they and their fetuses are healthy. Nurses with acute-care 
training draw the blood. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have drawn blood, the people have done fine," said Victor DePratti, 
medical director of the San Diego Blood Bank. "They don't necessarily require 
monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the North County Blood Bank routinely subjects mothers and fetuses 
to extensive observation before, during and after the donation is drawn. During 
Tindall's procedure, technicians used an electronic device to monitor her 
heartbeat while a second monitor tracked the fetal heartbeat. That monitoring 
added $25 to the blood bank's typical $94 charge for self-donation. 
</P>
<P>
To Sayers, the different monitoring practices underscore the need for caution. 
</P>
<P>
"That simply emphasizes that we don't have enough experience," Sayers said. "If 
we had enough experience, I don't think you'd see such widely divergent" 
monitoring procedures.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE CLINIC CLOSES PROGRAM FOR TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of steep cuts in state family planning money, the South Bay Free 
Clinic closed its 10-year-old Teen Advocate program Friday. Its peer counselors 
gave school presentations on pregnancy prevention and counseling on such 
problems as drug abuse, suicide and communicating with parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Hermosa Beach-based program, which the clinic said reached 7,000 students a 
year, has received $45,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, the clinic asked the South Bay Hospital District for 
$226,600 over two years to continue family planning medical services, including 
family planning, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy 
counseling and physical examinations. None of the money would be used for Teen 
Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
The free clinic, which has sites in Manhattan Beach and Gardena as well as a 
mental health program in Redondo Beach, expects to lose as much as $350,000 in 
family planning and matching grant money as a result of Gov. George 
Deukmejian's two-thirds cut in the state family planning budget in July, said 
Craig A. Vincent-Jones, the clinic's development officer.

INDIANS GATHER FOR REBURIAL RITUAL ON SITE WHERE HALL WAS TO HAVE RISEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dump truck backed up to the edge of the pitted lot, just a few feet away 
from the neat square holes dug by archeologists this spring. From a distance, 
Msgr. I. Brent Eagen watched the truck disgorge another load of earth, one of 
the 30 such loads it carried Friday up to Mission San Diego de Alcala. 
</P>
<P>
The earth will soon cover caisson holes originally dug for the parish hall that 
was to be built on the site. The human remains and mission ruins whose 
discovery ultimately scuttled the project will be buried beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
Eagen's signature Thursday on an agreement with local Indians scrapped his 
decade-old plans for the site. On Friday, Kumeyaay Indians hastily prepared for 
a reburial ceremony that will consecrate part of the lot as an Indian cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indians Arrive at Mission 
</P>
<P>
Descendants of Mission Indians from all over San Diego County have been asked 
to take part in a burial ritual that began Friday and was to continue all night 
and into this morning, said Kumeyaay leader Ron Christman. Kumeyaay Indians 
began arriving at the mission Friday morning to help put up cooking tents and 
the traditional ramada -- a temporary structure over the graves that symbolizes 
a church. 
</P>
<P>
Eagen, until recently accused by the Kumeyaay of gross disrespect for their 
dead, said he will conduct Catholic services to complement the Indian ceremony 
as called for in the agreement between the diocese and Indian representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The detailed document also specifies when the Indians may hold the services, 
how long they may stay, the height of the wooden cross the Indians plan to 
erect in the cemetery, and the type of soil the mission must supply to the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The pact "demonstrates our commitment to our friends in the Indian community 
and our sensitivity to their concerns," Eagen said in a press release. "We pray 
that today's agreement will remind all of us how much we mean to one another." 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement deals largely with the eastern one-third of the site 
designated as an Indian cemetery, ruins and bones on the rest of the site will 
be buried and sodded as well, Eagen said Friday. Preserving the exposed ruins 
as an exhibit would place too much of a burden on the mission and parish, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That plan drew an immediate protest from City Councilwoman Judy McCarty, an 
outspoken preservationist. "I hope that (the diocese) will one day come to 
realize the site's significance," McCarty said. "I was very hopeful that the 
area could be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty acknowledged that the mission can legally proceed with its plans, but 
said she hopes a public hearing Monday before the City Council will show the 
site's importance. "We owe it to the people of San Diego to put the facts on 
the record," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differing With Preservationists 
</P>
<P>
Although the mission has settled its dispute with the Indians, it still differs 
with historical preservationists on their proper role in mission planning. 
</P>
<P>
The preservationists have called for a new master plan for the mission, one 
developed in concert with preservation experts. "The mission has to come into 
1989 and acknowledge that it is necessary to include outside interests" in the 
planning process, said preservationist activist Joy Massa. 
</P>
<P>
But mission spokesman William Finley disagreed. "Certainly, we are now more 
aware of outside concerns," he said. "But the bottom line is that the church is 
still the landowner here." 
</P>
<P>
Eagen said the mission drew up its own master plan in the 1970s and does not 
need a new one. 
</P>
<P>
The issue could resurface when or if the diocese finds a new site for the 
meeting hall project. On Friday, Eagen identified a recently purchased 3 acres 
immediately north of the mission compound as the primary alternative site. He 
said a site should be selected by October.

MCMARTIN DEFENDANT CAUTIONED; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE SAYS HE'LL FINE OR JAIL PEGGY BUCKEY IF SHE TALKS TO JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge threatened Peggy McMartin Buckey on Friday with fines or jail time if 
she continues to talk to jurors, after he received a report from a deputy 
district attorney about her conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin Pre-School defendant was seen talking to a juror -- although 
apparently not a McMartin juror -- late Thursday, only a day after her comments 
in an elevator, overheard by a juror in a murder case being tried in a 
neighboring courtroom, led to the dismissal of that juror. The jury, which had 
been deliberating the fate of accused murderer Harvey Rader for two weeks, was 
ordered to begin anew with an alternate juror. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders said Buckey's garrulousness is "getting 
out of hand" and ordered her to remain in an office he has provided for the 
defense or to be accompanied by her attorney throughout the court day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differing Accounts 
</P>
<P>
The two sides gave differing accounts of the latest conversation, which will be 
the subject of a hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's lawyer, Dean Gits, told reporters that "the nature of Peggy is to be 
friendly." He said the only conversations she can recall within the past two 
days were brief exchanges with a woman who complimented her on her earrings and 
with a young man who sat down on the bench next to her and asked how things 
were going. Gits said he does not know if she was aware that either was a 
juror. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors said Deputy Dist. Atty. Reid Rose reported that he watched 
Buckey engage a juror in conversation for more than five minutes as they walked 
through the building and down the stairs toward the parking lot. The woman, who 
walked with a cane, was wearing a juror's badge but had not yet been picked for 
a jury. The subject of the conversation was allegedly Buckey's concern about 
the woman's health, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin said she is concerned that Buckey is attempting 
to project the image of "a nice person" in front of McMartin jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done," Pounders told the attorneys and Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting worse," he said. "This is all within the last few days we've had 
this problem repeated, constantly, and usually involving Mrs. Buckey." He said 
that after recent events he would have thought that "she would run like the 
devil was pursuing her" if anyone approached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Money Damages or Jail Time' 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said he will "impose sanctions" if he finds at the Monday hearing that 
his orders have been violated. "That means money damages or jail time. That's 
how serious it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have extra jurors to lose. It becomes absolutely critical to the 
completion of this case that the participants in this trial not have 
communications in front of any jurors anywhere, both to protect this trial and 
other trials." 
</P>
<P>
Both the defense and prosecution briefly questioned Buckey's son, Ray, who has 
been testifying in his own defense for 10 days, before he stepped down from the 
witness stand. Outside the courtroom, he held his mother as she sobbed, 
apparently upset at the dressing down she had received from Pounders.

<P>
The wounding of a Point Loma man armed with a shotgun in May by a San Diego 
police officer answering a domestic disturbance call was legally justified, the 
district attorney's office announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was either shoot or be shot," said a report issued by District Atty. Edwin 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Nels S. Peterson, was shot in the right shoulder May 19 by Officer Anthony 
Castellini at a house in the 4400 block of Greene Street, police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's wife had called police to report that her husband was acting abusive 
and was possibly on drugs, police said. After police arrived, Peterson ran to 
an upstairs room and came out with a 12-gauge shotgun, which he pointed in 
Castellini's direction, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Castellini fired once from his 9-millimeter pistol, Robinson said. A blood test 
revealed that Peterson had methamphetamine and amphetamine in his system, 
according to Miller. Peterson is being held in County Jail downtown on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, Robinson said.

<P>
Numerous requests for a mistrial in David Lucas' trial were unsuccessfully made 
by his attorneys -- outside the presence of the public and the jury -- during 
the jury's deliberations in the penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of some of the secret hearings conducted with Lucas' attorneys, 
prosecutors and San Diego Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes were released to 
the public late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the transcript, defense attorneys Steve Feldman and Alex Landon 
asked for a mistrial after the jury foreman sent in a note on July 18 stating 
"it is the feeling of the jury that a unanimous decision is not possible." 
</P>
<P>
Since the jury had only deliberated about five hours on whether Lucas should be 
executed or receive a life sentence without the possibility of parole, Hammes 
ordered the jury to resume its discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The jury returned a death verdict Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 34, of Spring Valley, was convicted June 21 of three throat-slashing 
murders in the Nov. 20, 1984, slaying of Anne Swanke, 22, of San Carlos and the 
May 4, 1979, killings of Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and her 3-year-old son, Colin, in 
their Normal Heights home. 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not release any transcripts or notes relating to the mysterious 
dismissal of one male juror during the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the jurors were whited out on the transcripts, except for the jury 
foreman. The transcripts were made available as the result of a legal action 
brought against the judge by the San Diego Union and Tribune.

The judge in the fraud trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter said Friday that he is 
"beginning to agree" with defense attorneys who believe they are entitled to 
see all the statements made by convicted swindler J. David (Jerry) Dominelli. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam set a special hearing for Monday afternoon, 
at which attorneys on both sides will present arguments concerning the release 
of several depositions Dominelli gave to FBI officials in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo told Gilliam she will object to the defense 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Since before the trial began in late March, Hunter's attorneys have been 
objecting to prosecutors' unwillingness to turn over documents, including 
Dominelli's statements. Although federal prosecutors have released to the 
defense several documents related to interviews with Dominelli, they have 
resisted handing over other statements. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Dominelli, who is not on the prosecution witness list, made 
statements that both incriminate and exonerate Hunter in terms of her knowledge 
of the giant J. David Ponzi scheme. However, the documents have never been 
released, and attorneys on both sides are prevented from commenting because of 
a sweeping gag order put in place by Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is facing a 234-count indictment in federal court, which alleges that 
she played an active role J. David &amp; Co., which defrauded about 1,200 
people out of as much as $90 million. Defense attorneys are trying to show that 
Hunter was blinded by her love for Dominelli and unaware of his illegal 
activities.

2 ORANGE COUNTY MEN CONVICTED IN $23-MILLION FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guilty verdicts against two Orange County men charged in a $23-million fraud 
scheme involving phony equipment-leasing transactions were unsealed Friday in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts against Robert P. Bernfeld, 37, of Huntington Beach and John N. 
Griffith, 39, of Santa Ana were sealed while the jury deliberated on a third 
defendant, Georgianna Carson, 41, of Huntington Beach. But U.S. District Judge 
William J. Rea, saying that one of the jurors had to return to her job, 
declared a mistrial in Carson's case and unsealed the other verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
A jury deadlocked in April on two other defendants charged in the case, 
including Kimball Richards, son of a former state senator. A new trial is set 
for Richards in October, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Leon W. Weidman. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the defendants arranged phony transactions in which Bernfeld's 
Riviera Capital Corp. pretended to buy audio equipment, including gear for rock 
concerts and recording studios, from a company run by another defendant. 
Riviera leased the "equipment" to Richard's Consolidated Allied Cos. and then 
sold the worthless leases to different financial institutions.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House voted 257 to 160 to keep the Stealth bomber program alive next fiscal 
year, but on a much leaner budget than President Bush wants and under 
congressional quality controls seen as excessive by many advocates of the 
futuristic warplane. The amendment was added to the $305-billion defense 
authorization bill for fiscal 1990 that later was sent to conference with the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to elude enemy radar and reach targets deep within Soviet territory, 
the nuclear-equipped Stealth, or B-2, would become the new air leg of America's 
air-land-sea triad strategy for deterring nuclear war with the Soviets. Each 
plane would cost upwards of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment calls for Congress to appropriate $3.7 billion for Stealth 
research and production next year rather than the $4.7 billion sought by the 
Pentagon, permits only two planes to be built next year rather than the five 
the Administration wants assembled and imposes performance standards on the 
unproven Stealth technology. But the amendment puts production on hold until 
the Administration devises and Congress accepts a scaled-back version of the 
Air Force's present plan to build 132 planes at a cost of $70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

Rail-Based MX 
</P>
<P>
The House adopted, 224 to 197, an amendment to strip the 1990 defense bill of 
money for transferring MX missiles from stationary silos to moving railroad 
cars. The rail deployment of U.S. missiles is slated for completion early next 
decade unless a new arms control pact with the Soviet Union rules it out. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment deleted about $500 million in procurement funding while leaving 
about $600 million in the bill for continuing research and development of the 
rail garrison plan. House members later stripped the bill of all of its funding 
for America's other next-generation missile system, the truck-borne Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to slow development of the rail-based MX missile 
system.

SDI Funding 
</P>
<P>
By a 248-175 vote, the House lowered funding for the proposed Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) anti-missile shield by $700 million next fiscal year. That 
reduction combined with an earlier cut in the House Armed Services Committee 
pared President Bush's fiscal 1990 request for SDI from $4.8 billion to $3.1 
billion. The research and development money is contained in the 1990 military 
spending bill (see previous votes).

YOUNG WHEELCHAIR CAMPERS GET A TASTE OF COMPETITION AT SDSU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARICARMEN EROLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to sports, most disabled children stay on the sidelines. But the 
45 children attending the third annual Junior Wheelchair Sports Camp at San 
Diego State University this week are getting a taste of competition. 
</P>
<P>
The children, ages 5 through 18, are instructed by counselors, also in 
wheelchairs, who are expert in tennis, swimming, track and field, archery and 
basketball. The camp was made possible this year with the help of the La Mesa 
and San Diego fire departments, which contributed volunteers and funds; the 
Easter Seal Society of San Diego and the Lions Club. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the firefighters participating this year are returning volunteers, and 
when they found out that the grant that funded the past two camps had run out, 
they organized donations and money-raising events. Other organizations donated 
the food that is served every day to the campers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positive Role Models 
</P>
<P>
But another key contribution comes from the people who volunteer to help run 
the camp and assist children during lunch and when they change clothes to 
participate in the sports, said Marla Knox, a camp coordinator and recreation 
leader with the Disabled Services Program of the San Diego Park and Recreation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong camp provides not only physical conditioning for the children, but 
positive role models as well: the people who have succeeded in life even though 
they are in wheelchairs, said Rick Draney, a counselor at the camp who suffered 
a spinal-cord injury eight years ago in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
The campers, most of them from San Diego, are transported by buses donated by 
Sharp Rehabilitation Hospital. Each day until 4 p.m., they participate in at 
least four activities in one-hour intervals. 
</P>
<P>
A positive attitude is emphasized during the week, and counselors encourage the 
children to take part in every sport, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Can Be Givers' 
</P>
<P>
Mark Shepherd, the camp's basketball instructor, was a police officer in 
Northern California until he was injured three years ago and paralyzed from the 
waist down. He said the camp allows for social interaction among the campers 
and a feeling of equality, which disabled children usually miss out on at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with kids like these lets me know there is something I can give back" 
to society, Shepherd said. "Most people think (disabled people) are takers, but 
we can be givers, and we are able to take care of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Draney, who has been a counselor and director in other camps for disabled 
children for six years, said the children at the camp are able to find out what 
they can do instead of being told what they can't. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to see their horizons, their vision, 
expanded, to see them dream a little more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Gilbert, a 15-year-old camper who has spina bifida, said what he enjoys 
most about the camp is the freedom to participate in different sports. 
</P>
<P>
Luke Ture, 11, suffered a spinal-cord injury when he was 2 years old in a car 
accident in Germany, and he said he sees the 10 instructors and counselors as 
good role models for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"You are getting role models for what you would like to do from people who are 
very successful," he said.

PROPOSED DURING CONTRACT TALKS;

<P>
COX CABLE OFFERED TO PAY TO TAPE COUNCIL MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cox Cable offered to fund weekly videotaping of Monday City Council sessions 
when the company was negotiating a controversial extension of the company's 
franchise with the city, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was made in June, when the council trimmed from its fiscal 1990 
budget the $72,000 for taping council sessions broadcast over Cox and 
Southwestern cable systems, City Manager John Lockwood said Friday. Taping was 
done by the San Diego County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood said he didn't tell the council about Cox's offer because the city and 
the company were involved in sensitive negotiations that would have extended 
Cox's franchise by 20 years, to 2029. Instead, Lockwood said, he only told 
council members that the city had received an offer to fund taping of the 
council sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood and a Cox official said the two deals were unconnected. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want that to be construed as some carrot they were dangling," 
Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McRann, vice president and general manager for Cox, said, "A lot of people 
would like to link the two, but they're totally unlinked." 
</P>
<P>
However, an aide to Councilman Bruce Henderson said Friday that the undisclosed 
deal "gives the appearance that some type of an arrangement was reached" to 
keep the council members on television in return for accepting an unfavorable 
franchise agreement with Cox. The aide, who asked not to be named, said the 
deal "is inappropriate at a time when we're in negotiations" with Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood responded that "people ought to become familiar with the facts before 
they make public comment." 
</P>
<P>
The franchise negotiations collapsed at a July 24 council meeting, when McRann 
expressed concern about taking over responsibility for an arcane tax assessed 
by the county. Henderson's office maintained that Cox withdrew after 15 months 
of negotiations because Henderson exposed the franchise deal as a poor 
agreement for the city. Cox's current contract expires in 2209. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to vote on Cox's videotape offer Monday. If the offer 
is approved, Cox will take over responsibility for videotaping council sessions 
Sept. 11, McRann said. He said that the project would cost Cox about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
In other budget matters, the council is also scheduled to vote Monday on a 
proposal to restore Sunday hours at branch libraries in Otay Mesa, North Park 
and Mira Mesa by spending $38,000 from its reserve fund.

Staubach Writes Bush About Eastern: Pro football Hall of Famer Roger Staubach 
has expressed concern to President Bush about the Eastern Airlines strike and 
bankruptcy reorganization, saying continued sales of Eastern assets could bring 
the airline's eventual demise. In a letter to Bush dated Aug. 1, the former 
Dallas Cowboys quarterback asked that a meeting be set up as soon as possible 
between representatives of the Eastern pilots union and Roger Porter, Bush's 
domestic policy adviser. Staubach wrote that his interest in the Eastern 
situation stemmed from his personal relationships with many striking Eastern 
pilots. Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said he had no comment on 
Staubach's letter or on speculation that the former football player might get 
involved in making a buyout offer for the company.

U.S. CAR PRICES WILL REMAIN STABLE, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. car sales are likely to grow by less than 1% a year through the year 2000 
and prices should remain steady, leading to heated competition for buyers, 
according to a University of Michigan study released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Delphi V forecast also found that auto industry officials do not expect 
cars of the 1990s to be as technologically advanced as they had predicted in 
earlier studies. 
</P>
<P>
The biennial report by the university's Center for the Study of Automotive 
Transportation said the domestic market will remain mature through the next 
decade, with more products offered to a relatively fixed set of customers. 
</P>
<P>
The Delphi forecast, based on questionnaires sent to about 750 executives, 
automotive engineers, consultants and others associated with the industry, 
predicted that passenger car sales in the decade will grow by less than 1% a 
year from 10.1 million in 1990 to 10.9 million in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, prices are likely to remain stable. A typical $14,000 car 
today will cost $15,000 in 1995 and $15,900 in the year 2000. The typical 
$15,000 import model will rise to $17,000 in 10 years, the survey estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The key elements that will mark competition in the next decade are quality, 
cost and product innovation, the study said. "Both world-class cost and quality 
are considered as just entrance tickets to the international competition of the 
future," the forecast noted. 
</P>
<P>
It said the intensity of competition will accelerate and the winning companies 
will be those able to develop strong relationships with their customers. The 
forecast predicted that auto makers will have to think increasingly in terms of 
quality for the life of their products, not just until the warranty runs out. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, at least one-third of Delphi participants thought plastic could 
replace steel by 1995 in key body parts such as hoods, fenders and rear panels. 
This year, 20% of respondents or fewer thought plastic would be used in 
important parts of the auto body. 
</P>
<P>
In another area, the new study predicted that collision warning systems are the 
most likely safety feature to be incorporated in cars during the next decade. 
Other expected safety improvements include improved exterior and interior crash 
protection, anti-lock brake systems and radar brakes. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that many industry officials believe that the percentage of 
foreign parts on cars built by the Big Three U.S. auto makers will rise if no 
domestic content legislation is passed. 
</P>
<P>
Estimating that 21% of parts on U.S. cars are now foreign built, the study 
predicted that the figure will rise to 26% by 1995 and 30% by 2000. More parts 
will be produced in Mexico and South America, while fewer parts will be 
imported from Japan, the study said.

Gas Firm Seeks Pipeline Expansion: El Paso Natural Gas Co. said it has filed an 
application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expand its 
interstate pipeline system by up to 600 million cubic feet a day at a cost of 
$201 million. The company said the expansion is needed to meet present and 
future natural gas needs in its principal market area of California. It said 
the California Public Utilities Commission is looking into the need for new 
interstate pipeline capacity within the state and also the need for increased 
service levels to existing gas users. The company said the incremental 
throughput resulting from the proposed system expansion will reduce the average 
cost of transportation for all present and future customers.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: WHY SOME MORTGAGE RATES AREN'T DOWN 
</P>

QUESTION: I have an adjustable-rate mortgage tied to the 11th District cost of 
funds. Recently I have been reading about the drop in interest rates by the big 
lenders, supposedly causing a corresponding drop in adjustable mortgage rates. 
However, the 11th District cost of funds has not been declining. Can you 
explain why? -- R. B. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are not the only homeowner wondering about this matter these days. 
Since the early 1980s, when adjustable-rate mortgages became common, the 
otherwise esoteric 11th District cost of funds index has come under a lot of 
scrutiny whenever interest rates have dropped and the index hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
To understand why this is possible, you have to understand what the index is 
and how it operates. The index is the weighted average cost of all funds 
deposited into savings institutions in the 11th District of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank, a territory that covers California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Among the funds tracked are those in savings, checking and money market 
accounts, certificates of deposit and other bank instruments. The interest 
rates on all these accounts are averaged to determine the index, a figure that 
represents the interest rate, or "cost of funds," that the savings institutions 
actually had to pay their customers to attract the money they now have 
available to lend. 
</P>
<P>
The district computes the index rate monthly and publishes the figure for a 
particular month on the final working day of the following month. The rate for 
June, 1989, announced last Monday, was 8.923%. Adjustable-rate mortgages 
typically run about two to three points higher than the index, a difference 
designed to cover the lenders' overhead costs and profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
Because the index includes both long- and short-term borrowings, it is 
considered far less volatile than other measures of the cost of money. For 
example, an analysis prepared for Great Western Savings shows that in August, 
1981, when the prime rate nearly reached 21%, the interest rates being paid on 
12-month Treasury bills exceeded 16%. But the 11th District index reached only 
12.029%. 
</P>
<P>
However, just as the 11th District index rises more slowly than other indexes, 
it falls more slowly as well. Lenders estimate that it typically lags from two 
to three months behind the one-year interest rates being paid to purchasers of 
12-month U.S. Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
Rates on 12-month Treasury bills have gradually been falling since April, as 
have other key interest rates, most notably the prime rate. (This latter rate 
is the interest that banks charge their largest and most credit-worthy 
customers.) However, over the same time span, the 11th District cost of funds 
index has risen. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because late last year and during the first four months of this year, 
interest rates were rising, and the 11th District index is just now catching up 
with that earlier rise. Lenders say the 11th District cost of funds index 
should begin to drop over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The current 11th District rate is available on a taped telephone message to 
California callers at (800) 824-6560. A brochure on the subject is available 
from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Communications Department, 
P.O. Box 7948, San Francisco, Calif. 94120.

Finding Value in 'Worthless' Stocks 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you please comment on stock certificates that are known to have no value 
except as antiques or collectibles? I am specifically thinking about the 
certificates of such companies as Dusenberg and Durant, two former auto makers 
that have long since gone out of business. Are their stock certificates worth 
anything to collectors? -- W. E. D. 
</P>
<P>
A: In a word: yes. 
</P>
<P>
Our advisers say interest in old stock certificates is gradually increasing 
among collectors who believe that these documents have both a historical and an 
aesthetic value. Europeans are said to be among the primary buyers of the old 
certificates at this time, but some brokers predict that the hobby could become 
as popular as stamp collecting. 
</P>
<P>
The actual price that these certificates command on the market is quite another 
matter, but getting a quote should not be terribly difficult. Our advisers say 
several reputable dealers can tell you what they would be willing to pay for 
the certificates. When seeking a quote, you should send a photocopy of the 
certificates along with your name, address and a stamped, self-addressed 
envelope for a reply. Never, ever, send the actual certificates. You may never 
see them again. 
</P>
<P>
Among the brokers dealing in antique stock certificates are R. M. Smythe &amp; 
Co., 24 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004, and George LaBarre Galleries, P.O. Box 
746, Hollis, N.H. 03051. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Does a Pension Reduce Social Security Checks? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I receive monthly payments from a private pension fund. Am I entitled to 
benefits from my husband's Social Security account as well? My pension exceeds 
what I would get on his account. I've asked several different people about this 
and have received several different answers. It's all too confusing for my poor 
addled brain! -- T. S. 
</P>
<P>
A: This is really quite a simple matter, and the answer is sure not to boggle. 
</P>
<P>
Your private pension, whatever its amount, has absolutely nothing whatsoever to 
do with your eligibility to collect Social Security on your husband's account. 
What counts is whether you are eligible as a wage earner to collect Social 
Security on your own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
If you did not contribute to Social Security and are not entitled to collect 
anything on your own account, then you would be eligible to draw on your 
husband's benefits as a spouse (or widow). 
</P>
<P>
If you are entitled to your own Social Security, then your ability to collect 
on your husband's account is limited. In this case, you would be able to draw 
spousal benefits on your husband's account only if your own benefits were less 
than half the benefits to which he is entitled. Social Security regulations 
limit you to picking whichever benefit account gives you the larger payment. 
But you may not draw on both accounts. 
</P>
<P>
See, it's not all that confusing.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: SOME TIPS TO REDUCE FUTURES TRADING RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this week's indictments of 46 Chicago commodities traders have you scared 
about futures markets, you're not alone. Even without the scandal, it is risky 
territory. At least four of five individual investors who dabble in futures 
lose money -- and that's assuming their trades are handled properly, as is the 
case most of the time, since most brokers are honest. 
</P>
<P>
This week's developments show that even some of the most sophisticated 
professionals don't know when they are being cheated by illicit trades. Victims 
of some of the indicted broker-traders actually thought they were getting good 
"fills," or prices at which their trades were executed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, however, they may have been victims of "front running" -- in which a 
broker-trader illegally trades for his personal account first, profiting from 
the price movement that will result from the customer order. In other cases, 
brokers were alleged to have skimmed customer funds, kept more profitable 
trades for themselves or committed other transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
But if you still want to include futures as part of your investment strategy -- 
knowing that you can earn far more than in stocks, bonds or real estate if you 
make the right moves -- the Chicago probe provides some insights into how to 
reduce your chances of getting taken: 
</P>
<P>
* Know with whom you are dealing. Although it is no guarantee that you won't 
get hurt, deal with reputable firms. Make sure that your broker is registered 
with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is a member of the National 
Futures Assn., an industry watchdog group. To do that, contact the NFA at (800) 
621-3570, or 200 W. Madison St., Suite 1600, Chicago, Ill. 60606. Soon the NFA 
might also have records on whether your broker has ever been disciplined by any 
of the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep vigilant. Monitor your trades like a hawk. Keep good notes. Review your 
confirmation statements carefully. "Don't lose touch with your money," says 
Robert K. Wilmouth, president of the NFA. 
</P>
<P>
* Complain vigorously. If you suspect bad trades, call your broker immediately 
and gripe loudly. Don't expect anyone else to be vigilant for you. "I wonder 
how much the big brokerage firms watch every trade," says Robert N. Gordon, 
president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York trading house that uses 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
If your complaint is serious and corrective action hasn't been taken, consider 
complaining to the exchanges or to the NFA. They offer arbitration procedures 
for investors. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also handles 
complaints. The NFA acts as a clearing house for information on grievances. To 
complain or find out more about arbitration, contact the NFA. 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of "market orders." Some longtime investors avoid making so-called 
market orders, the type that require the floor broker to execute at the best 
possible price at the time the order hits the trading pits. Those orders are 
most vulnerable to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
To see that your market orders are satisfactorily executed, you must monitor a 
computer showing the exact price movements at the time of your order, says 
Almer Orr III, president of A. O. Management Corp., a Pittsburgh firm that 
manages commodity investments. Otherwise you may never know whether you've been 
shortchanged, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're leaving your destiny in someone else's hand, you're open for the 
type of (fraud) that goes on," Orr says. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Orr says, be wary about placing orders to be executed at the open or 
close of trading. Those also are vulnerable to abuses such as front running or 
prearranged trading between collaborating brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Orr suggests, stick largely to "limit orders" in which you specify 
the exact price you want for your trade. There are drawbacks to these orders 
too, however. If the market moves too fast, and thus away from the price you 
specified, your order may not be executed unless you specify a new limit order. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider professional management. If you can't monitor the markets 
constantly, then you probably have no business trading futures on your own. 
Instead, consider hiring a professional commodity manager or invest in a 
private or public commodity pool or fund. They are like mutual funds in that 
they invest in futures and are professionally managed. Their professional 
managers are in a better position to make sure you don't get cheated. 
</P>
<P>
Public commodity funds are run as limited partnerships and require initial 
investments of as little as $3,000, says Leon Rose, publisher of Managed 
Account Reports, a Columbia, Md., newsletter that tracks these funds. Privately 
run commodity pools also qualify as limited partners but require a bit more as 
an initial investment -- say, $5,000 to $10,000, he says. Having your own 
manager may require at least $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some public funds have performed quite well, with some gaining more than 100% 
annually in recent years. On average they have posted gains in four of the past 
five years, Rose says. But individual funds can lose big amounts. 
</P>
<P>
They key is finding a fund manager with a good long-term record in both good 
and bad markets. Several firms monitor commodity pools and funds. One of the 
best known is Managed Account Reports. Write them at 5513 Twin Knolls Road, 
Columbia, Md. 21045, for a free sample.

GIFT FOR THE KID WHO HAS EVERYTHING: A CREDIT CARD

A bank dedicated to young customers is offering what it says is the first 
credit card for children. 
</P>
<P>
Young Americans Bank introduced the credit cards at a party marking the 
institution's second anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Like most credit cards, these have restrictions. Youngsters must talk a parent 
or other adult into co-signing and guaranteeing payment on their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Although cardholders must be at least 12 years old and cannot exceed a $100 
credit limit, the bank will consider increasing credit limits and lowering age 
requirements for particularly credit-worthy children, said Leanne Cadman, who 
heads the bank's loan department. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the MasterCards, issued by United Bank of Denver, are just like 
mom's and dad's. Monthly statements will tell kids they can make a minimum 
monthly payment or pay off the whole balance. Interest will accrue on the 
balance at the annual rate of 18.8%, Cadman said. 
</P>
<P>
Young Americans Bank, a full-service, state-chartered and federally insured 
bank, already offers checking accounts for children 12 or older. In its two 
years of service, it has signed up 10,000 depositors. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them they need to use credit cards with care and not to abuse them," 
Cadman said. "And of course, we impress on them that whatever you charge you 
have to pay back." 
</P>
<P>
The bank was founded two years ago by Denver cable-TV executive Bill Daniels.

When this week's games began in Seattle, the Angels led the major leagues in 
team home runs with 98. That's an average of .95 dingers per game and projects 
to a season total of 154. While that would be a 25% improvement over last 
year's 124, it would not be close to the Angels' season record, 189, hit in 
their first season in old Wrigley Field. Nor would it threaten the team season 
high since they have been playing in Anaheim Stadium, 186, hit in 1982, when 
Reggie Jackson set the team individual season record of 39. Here's a look at 
the tables

The visiting teams to Anaheim Stadium have had their fair share of home runs in 
the ballpark. The Detroit Tigers are the most prolific home-run-hitting 
visitors, knocking out 143 since the stadium opened in 1966. The Seattle 
Mariners, on the other hand, have hit a mere 51 homers in their 12 completed 
seasons.

Park Chul Un, South Korea's first state minister for political affairs, on 
Friday disputed a network report that he secretly visited North Korea twice 
during June. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to the report," Park told reporters when asked to comment on 
a news report by Munhwa Broadcasting Corp. Television. "Somebody is inventing 
and propagating the story." 
</P>
<P>
Munhwa said in its main evening newscast Thursday that Park first visited North 
Korea around June 4 accompanied by a fellow legislator of the ruling Democratic 
Justice Party and working-level officials, and returned home after a five-day 
stay. South Korea bans visits to North Korea.

PACKARD OPPOSES TWO COUNTY SITES STUDIED FOR AIRPORT

A congressman who sits on a powerful House aviation panel said Friday that he 
strongly opposes two Orange County sites recommended for a new regional 
airport. A third primary site is in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) said potential airport sites in Cleveland 
National Forest east of San Juan Capistrano and at Camp Pendleton, both in 
Packard's 43rd Congressional District, "are unacceptable to me, and I will 
fight them." 
</P>
<P>
He voiced equally strong objections to two secondary sites in Cristianitos 
Canyon near San Clemente and Palomar Airport in San Diego County -- also in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply are not anxious at all to have an airport sited in either the 
populated area, or the future populated area of Orange County," Packard said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said the only primary site listed that seems acceptable is soon-to-be-closed 
Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Packard sits on the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee, which oversees the Federal Aviation Administration 
and which would have to approve federal money used in construction of a new 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope (the site selection committee) will read some writing on the wall 
there," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential sites were recommended earlier this month by the staff of the 
Airport Site Coalition, a private group sanctioned by the Orange County Board 
of Supervisors and aided by professional planning consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is assisting preparations for a new air passenger airport that 
would relieve the severe overcrowding at John Wayne Airport, nestled between 
Costa Mesa and Irvine, and northeast of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he has had preliminary talks with Rep. George E. Brown Jr. 
(D-Colton), whose district includes Norton Air Force Base, about the idea of 
putting a new airport there. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is inquiring about what the constituents feel about whether a 
commercial airport could replace some of that economic and job loss" caused by 
the Air Force's decision to close the base, Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Building a new airport at the proposed site in the Cleveland National Forest, 
at Potrero Los Pinos, "would have a very serious impact on the environment," 
Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Camp Pendleton location "is totally out of the question," he added, because 
"it would literally destroy Camp Pendleton as a training base. We simply cannot 
permit that."

POLICE PRAISE THEM BUT COPTER POOLS HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON

When a Costa Mesa police helicopter whirs over the city by day, it is called 
Eagle I. When it takes to the skies at night, its moniker becomes Eagle III. 
</P>
<P>
Until two years ago, the night shift copter was known as Eagle II. But that 
name conjures up bitter memories for the crew members who fly the machines in 
Orange County. The name Eagle II was retired in memory of the three men who 
died when a Costa Mesa police helicopter collided in the air with a Newport 
Beach police chopper in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although the name change provides a ready reminder of the hazards of police 
helicopter work, police departments in the county have been undaunted in 
pressing forward to start or expand aerial patrols: 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Ana increased the helicopter coverage it receives on a contract basis 
from Costa Mesa Police as of last Sunday. Instead of flying three times a week, 
the patrols, formerly made three times a week, are now made nightly. Duty is 
rotated among three Santa Ana officers to accompany the Costa Mesa police 
pilots as observers. 
</P>
<P>
* The Brea Police Department has for the last three months been studying the 
feasibility of starting its own helicopter patrol. 
</P>
<P>
* Some police departments are planning to beef up or modernize their helicopter 
fleets. Costa Mesa plans to add another four-seat helicopter with some of the 
money it receives from its contract with Santa Ana. Newport Beach police plan 
to replace an older copter with money realized from the sale of assets seized 
from drug dealers. And Huntington Beach -- which 20 years ago was the first 
Orange County police agency with helicopter service -- ordered two new advanced 
helicopters that will be available in two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12 Available 
</P>
<P>
All told, there are 12 police helicopters available for duty among five law 
enforcement agencies in Orange County. All but two -- the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department copters known as Duke I and Duke II -- are used in cities 
in the northern section of the county. There have been years of talk about the 
advantages of creating helicopter pools for routine patrols, but a Huntington 
Beach police captain who has studied the issue said such an arrangement appears 
years away because of questions about how it would be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, however, has taken the first step. The contract by which Costa Mesa 
will receive as much as $200,000 a year allows Santa Ana to have police 
helicopter patrols that use its own officers as observers -- at a fraction of 
what it would cost to buy helicopters and train its own crew. (Newport Beach, 
for example, spends $490,000 a year on its helicopters, and that figure does 
not take into account the crew members' salaries.) New turbine-powered machines 
can cost up to $700,000, police helicopter officials said, and, of course, the 
maintenance, fuel and associated training would be extra. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters said the agreement with Costa Mesa proved 
successful during a yearlong test of patrols on Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried it on a test basis for three days a week," Walters said. "We 
evaluated it closely and found it very beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Sgt. Bill Bechtel, who helps supervise his department's helicopter 
operations, said the the money will be applied to the purchase of another 
McDonnell Douglas 500E, the black-and-white sedan of the skies. Having another 
copter will help reduce "down" time because of maintenance, he said, and it 
could also mean that two helicopters could be in the air at once serving both 
Costa Mesa and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the patrol area will not affect response time significantly, Bechtel 
added, contending that the copters would still be able to get to just about any 
spot in five minutes or less. 
</P>
<P>
In what also could become a law-enforcement trend, Newport Beach is planning to 
pay the $600,000 price for a new helicopter with funds obtained from the sale 
of assets seized from drug dealers, Newport Beach Officer Bob Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in local police departments say the machines have proved their worth 
time and again and that new uses for them are being found all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel said the Costa Mesa one answers more than 400 radio calls for 
assistance a month and was directly responsible for 174 arrests made in the 
12-month period ended July 31. (Figures for drunk drivers are not included in 
this tally.) 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police say their copters are especially useful in spotting 
traffic violations. Should an officer in a helicopter suspect that a particular 
motorist has run a red light, for example, he can direct an officer in a patrol 
car below to stop the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
700 Tickets a Year 
</P>
<P>
"We write 700 tickets a year," boasted Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Jeff King. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopter officials shy away, however, from drawing direct comparisons to the 
productivity of helicopter versus ground units. "It's kind of hard to compare 
the effect of something that can't do comparable functions," Oakley of Newport 
Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, finding people hiding at night is something police helicopters 
are specially equipped for -- there are the spotlights and the infrared scopes 
in the cockpit. The infrared is especially helpful; with it, officers can tell 
which cars in a parking lot were driven most recently because the device can 
detect heat from the engines. 
</P>
<P>
The infrared equipment's abilities have even astonished other officers, Bechtel 
said. In one recent case, he said, he was directing ground officers to an auto 
theft suspect whom they thought was lying in a field that had been thoroughly 
searched, eluding even the noses of police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
On the infrared scope, however, the suspect "glowed like a light bulb" on the 
monitoring screen. The officers on the ground were incredulous, though, until 
the helicopter beamed its light on the suspect. That, Bechtel said, sent the 
suspect scampering off into a nearby auto mall; the officers chased him and 
eventually were able to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Helicopter officials said the noise from low-flying police helicopters 
sometimes brings complaints from residents, but King said people usually are 
more understanding when they are told why the helicopter was there. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the police agencies have taken steps to control noise. Shortly after 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department began using them, the copters' tail 
rotors were replaced with quieter blades, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their usefulness, agencies have hesitated to pool their helicopter 
patrols because of financial and logistical concerns. Although the five 
agencies routinely answer emergency calls from neighboring police departments 
that do not have helicopters, Santa Ana is the only department to pay for the 
use of another city's whirlybird. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach bases its copter on Gothard Street in a rural area, but each 
of the other agencies operates out of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Capt. Merle Schneblin, who recently completed a report on the 
pooling issue as part of a management study course, said that agencies refuse 
to come to terms with the idea of consolidating resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Response 
</P>
<P>
Schneblin said he found "a lot of feelings for it, a lot of feelings against 
it" when he recently brought police officials together to discuss the issue. He 
predicted that officials will not seriously consider it, however, until a 
serious budget crunch or a disaster proves the wisdom of having areawide copter 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably going to take some catastrophe . . . to force the issue," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Chief Jim Cook said that his department might be interested 
in a joint helicopter agency but that it has no plans to start its own service. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very expensive. . . . I think they are very good programs, but they 
are not on our list of priorities in the future," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton Police Capt. Richard Kvancz said that his department has 
informally been discussing the possibility of adding a helicopter for years, 
even joining in a joint agency of cities in the area. But he also expressed 
concern about the expense. "It's very expensive, not only the initial costs but 
the maintenance and additional training."

SAN CLEMENTE PREPARES FOR POSSIBLE WATER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a continuing water shortage despite voluntary conservation efforts, 
San Clemente is preparing for possible mandatory water rationing if the city 
reservoir drops much farther, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has directed its staff to draft an emergency water-rationing 
ordinance to be invoked if the city's situation worsens. Just what restrictions 
would be imposed have yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think we'll have to resort to anything so drastic (as water 
rationing) right now, but we're being prepared," said Mayor Brian J. Rice. 
"We're still urging people to save water voluntarily, and we hope the situation 
will remedy itself." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the emergency ordinance will probably be presented to the City 
Council in early September. But he said no firm decision had been made as to 
how serious the shortage would have to become before water rationing would be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
In early July, city officials learned that its sole reservoir was slipping 
considerably below comfortable levels. Greg Morehead, city utilities manager, 
said he checked and found that water use for the summer months this year was 
unexpectedly running 10% above last summer's level. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said the basic problem was that the Tri-Cities Reservoir, which serves 
San Clemente, only has one intake pipe. Plenty of water is available from the 
state's Northern California aqueduct and the Colorado River, but the pipe 
cannot refill the reservoir as quickly as residential use is draining it, 
Morehead said. 
</P>
<P>
The city three weeks ago began urging residents to voluntarily cut back on 
water use. Chris McKeage, city water superintendent, said Friday that voluntary 
conservation had helped, but definitely had not solved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The water level in the reservoir is going down slower now, but we're not out 
of the woods yet," McKeage said. "If we were to have a hot spell, I'm afraid 
the water level would be dropping even further. The voluntary cutback is 
helping, but we've still got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said that for a "comfortable" supply level, the Tri-Cities Reservoir 
off Calle Agua in northwest San Clemente should be at 30 feet. The reservoir 
level is now at 26 feet, Morehead said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it goes below 25 feet, then I'm very worried," he added. He said that he 
would recommend mandatory water rationing "at somewhere between a level of 22 
and 25 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said increased water use this summer was due to a combination of 
things: "new residents, warm weather, new planting of slopes late in the year, 
soil compaction (for new development) and things like street cleaning." 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates in San Clemente have charged that the city's water 
shortage stems from "unrestricted growth" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Brouillette, president of San Clementeans for Managed Growth, said the 
water shortage "reflects all the growth that the city has been allowing while 
not considering how the growth will hurt our water supplies." 
</P>
<P>
Rice countered that he believes the city government is conscientiously trying 
to manage growth and keep service levels unimpaired. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir will get a second water intake pipe in 1991, Rice said. Until 
then, he said, the city may face more temporary water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"My big worry right now is about next summer, the summer of 1990," he said.

POLICE SEEK HELP IN FINDING MISSING, ILL TEEN-AGE BOY

<P>
Police appealed to the public Friday to help find a 17-year-old schizophrenic 
with the mental and emotional development of an 11-year-old who has been 
missing since July 12. 
</P>
<P>
Erick Scott Appel of San Bernardino becomes nervous and may experience auditory 
or visual hallucinations without medication. 
</P>
<P>
"Erick is extremely trusting, vulnerable and susceptible. He is like a 10- or 
11-year-old kid in a lot of ways," said his father, Vince Appel. "I have a 
feeling he might have gotten in a car. 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt pain I didn't know a person could feel," he said of his son's 
disappearance. "I feel like a big hypodermic needle is in my heart. . . . I 
feel like someone is using him and he can't get away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Press Conference 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Orange at a news conference sponsored by the Adam 
Walsh Child Resource Center, investigators said they do not believe Erick ran 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"He always called somebody," San Bernardino Sheriff's Detective David Heard 
said. In addition, Erick left his boom-box radio, which he carried everywhere, 
at home because he was going on job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Heard said that while there is no specific evidence indicating foul play, the 
circumstances surrounding Erick's disappearance are worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Appel, his stepmother, said Erick appears normal and speaks normally, 
but that he tells fanciful, farfetched stories. He blinks his eyes deeply when 
nervous, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Erick is 6 feet, 1 inch tall, weighs about 130 pounds, has blue eyes and brown, 
crew-cut hair. He was last seen riding his purple and white BMX bicycle on E 
Street in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about Erick's whereabouts should contact Detective 
Heard at (714) 387-3500 or Gary Whaley of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center 
in Westminster at (714) 898-4802.

GROUP NEEDS $12,000 BY AUG. 15; 
</P>
<P>
SHOW TO BE STAGED TO KEEP TEACHER 
</P>

The Fountain Valley High School Vocal Music Foundation, which is trying to 
raise $28,000 to save the job of the school's music teacher, will hold a 
benefit show and champagne reception Aug. 12 at the B'nai Tzedek Temple in 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The musical performance will be the last chance for the group to raise the 
money they must hand over to the Huntington Beach Union High School District, 
which says it will keep music teacher Ted Reid only if the parents come up with 
$12,000 by Aug. 15 to pay for Reid's first-semester salary. The balance, 
$14,000, will be due at an unspecified time in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, who has been at the school three years, was one of 32 teachers who were 
told they will not be rehired in the fall because of the district's declining 
enrollment. In two years, officials say, enrollment at the district's six high 
schools has decreased by 2,200. While school enrollment overall in Orange 
County is increasing rapidly, expensive housing costs in some coastal 
communities and other areas have kept out younger families with children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Started Campaign 
</P>
<P>
But parents of Reid's students say they believe so strongly in the music 
program and in his ability to teach their children an appreciation and 
knowledge of music that they started the campaign to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
Reid was teaching three classes of music, as well as two classes of English, 
and was director of the school's three award-winning choirs. If the foundation 
raises $28,000, the district has agreed to keep Reid on as a part-time music 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The parents' group had raised about $6,000, along with pledges for other 
unspecified amounts of money, and this week received another $1,000 in 
donations after news stories about their effort, said Pat Harney, one of the 
parents leading the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest donation so far has been $500 from a Newport Beach lawyer who 
called Harney this week after reading about their effort. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it made him see how important music had been to him, so he's sending 
us a check for $500," Harney said. "But we still have so far to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Our time line is so short," she said. "We're just going everywhere and asking 
everyone for help." 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the benefit is $10. For more information contact Harney at (714) 
963-3778.

<P>
ROBBERS TAKE WING WITH 4 BIRDS IN HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Polly, it seems, is worth a lot of crackers. 
</P>
<P>
When two men walked into a Buena Park pet store this week expressing an 
interest in conures, a small member of the parrot family, store clerks soon 
found out that the men were after more than birdseed. 
</P>
<P>
As employees Gabriel Sanchez, 19, and Jaime Huerta, 18, answered questions 
about the exotic birds, the men brandished guns and ordered them to take the 
four tame conures out of two glass cages and put them in a box. They then fled 
with the four birds, valued at $1,188, a $100 bird cage and about $300 from the 
store's register, police said. They were last seen driving south on Beach 
Boulevard in a four-door, maroon Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery has left employees and detectives aflutter. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd expect this to happen in a liquor store," said Sanchez, who felt a gun 
pressed against his back during the robbery Monday at Pet Inc., 5300 Beach 
Blvd. "But a pet store?" 
</P>
<P>
Police on Friday said they hope the birds' squawking would catch someone's 
attention and lead police to them. They even hope that the birds, able to 
mimmick human voices, would reveal clues about their captors. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, police have no leads, said Buena Park police spokesman Richard 
McMillen. 
</P>
<P>
The missing birds, all native to South America but bred domestically, include a 
bright orange sun conure valued at $475, a green and gray dusky conure valued 
at $275, a green and peach peach-front conure fetching $249 and a green and 
black Nanday conure valued at $189, store employees said. 
</P>
<P>
Police speculate that the exotic birds, which weigh about seven ounces each and 
measure a foot long, will be sold or kept as pets, McMillen said. They can live 
to be 50 years old on a diet of seeds, fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's a trendy thing to have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The store, which opened in June, had the birds for just two weeks before the 
robbery, said clerk Karen Werner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just hoping whoever has them will take care of them," she said. "I've 
heard horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the robbers didn't just wing it. 
</P>
<P>
They visited the store earlier, he said, and told the clerks they wanted a 
Nanday conure as a gift for a wife. The men said they would return to buy the 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they came back to rob the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt something on my back, and he said, 'OK guys, put all the birds in a box 
real slowly,' " Sanchez said. As one robber held the pair at gunpoint and 
forced the clerks to put money in paper bags, the other ran out to get a car 
ready, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the robbers appeared concerned for their feathered loot. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to be really interested in them," Sanchez said, holding one of 
three birds the store replaced. "Even while they were holding us up, they asked 
what the birds eat. They wanted to make sure there was enough birdseed in the 
cage." 
</P>
<P>
The robbers were 5 feet 8 to 5 feet 9, average weights, 25 to 35 years old with 
dark brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
The species stolen from the pet store is one of the easiest to acquire and 
least expensive parrots available, said Larry Farrington, a U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service special agent. 
</P>
<P>
"The robbery would have made more sense if it would have been a more exotic 
bird," Farrington said. "For a commercial species like that, it sounds odd to 
me that they're going through the trouble." 
</P>

Once tamed, these small parrots enjoy the company of people. They also like 
each other. Conures tend to squawk a lot, so Buena Park detectives are hoping 
neighbors will be able to report the birds. These parrots can also mimick 
voices, so they might be able to pick up expressions from their captors.

NEW STEPS FOR DANCING WATERS; 
</P>
<P>
FOUNTAIN SHOW AT HOTEL IS NOW PURE DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lights dim, the music swells, and the booming voice of an announcer washes 
over hundreds of people assembled before a pool of water in a corner of the 
Disneyland Hotel grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rubin's eyes are on the water, not the people, as he listens for the 
opening strains of the theme music from "Steamboat Willie," the 1928 cartoon 
that introduced Mickey Mouse to America. Hands dancing across a beat-up-looking 
control box, Rubin pushes the buttons and pulls the levers that bring 16 
fountains to life, their spray bouncing up and down to match the tooting of the 
steamboat music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being an entertainer," said Rubin, who has "played" the Dancing 
Waters for 10 years. "I take a lot of pride in the show." 
</P>
<P>
The popular free show has been performed nearly every night, weather 
permitting, since the production opened 19 years ago. But this summer, the 
waters are dancing to a new beat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disney Bought It Back 
</P>
<P>
Familiar tunes from Broadway, classical composers and the pop music world have 
been left behind for a new show featuring all-Disney music and characters. The 
change came 18 months after the Walt Disney Co. bought the Disneyland Hotel, 
which had been owned by the Wrather Corp., according to Tony Peluso, director 
of entertainment for Disney properties. 
</P>
<P>
The new show, officials said, has been enthusiastically received by the summer 
crowds, particularly children, who crowd to the edge of the water show and 
extend their small arms to try to touch the mist from the fountains. 
</P>
<P>
"Oooh, that's pretty," declared a towheaded toddler sitting on his father's 
shoulders as the show began. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Rogers, a visitor from Oklahoma who had seen the old Dancing Waters 
show, said she prefers the new version. "I like the characters and it seems 
like they put in more fountains." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-minute show traces the history of Disney productions through music and a 
narration, moving from cartoons to movies to television. Though "The Mickey 
Mouse Club" theme song draws the largest sing-along response from the audience, 
Dancing Waters creator Michael A. Berkus said the music from the movie 
"Fantasia" is the most challenging for the show's operators. 
</P>
<P>
"The swaying of the fountains is very difficult to do," said Berkus, who 
learned to "play" the waters at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. "There's an 
art to playing it. It has to be taught." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 6 'Conductors' 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just six people have played the waters at the hotel since 1970, Berkus 
added, and the operators are often asked if they are musicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs to Stay Ahead 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a musician," Rubin said, "but if I were, I'd have to be an offbeat 
musician because I have to be about a half-second ahead of the beat." 
</P>
<P>
The show's operators work at stage left, where control panels for the 
fountains, spotlights and a fiber-optic wall are located. Behind the 
control-panel area is a small room that houses the music on reel-to-reel tape 
and other maintenance equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Dancing Waters show area was designed by Berkus, and includes a 
semicircular pool measuring 80 by 40 feet in front of the 16 water jets housed 
in a separate shallow pool. The fountains are backlighted by spotlights that 
can create water colors from baby blue to fire engine red. Behind the water is 
a wall of fiber-optic panels that flash to the beat of the music; Disney 
cartoon characters that light up during the show are perched atop the wall. 
</P>
<P>
In designing the show, Berkus said he envisions himself as a conductor and each 
fountain as a musical instrument. "My goal is to make people believe they are 
seeing music," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he translated the lyrical music of "Fantasia" into graceful 
fountains that arch and wave, while a gunshot in the Davy Crockett theme song 
is punctuated with one burst from a single fountain that shoots water 40 feet 
into the air. The "Electrical Parade" music features the light board, its 
panels flashing patterns of red, green, pink and blue. 
</P>
<P>
The Dancing Waters show shut down for about two weeks to prepare for the new 
production. The operators rehearsed six hours a day for eight days to music 
blaring from a boom box sitting on the cement staging area. 
</P>
<P>
Berkus is delighted to explain the machinery behind Dancing Waters, much of 
which is far from new. The control panel for the fountains was built in Germany 
in 1948, and part of the fountain area has been powered by a $6 motor from an 
Erector set since 1970, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always believed that if it works, don't fix it," said Berkus, who also 
owns an Anaheim market firm but has a car with license plates reading "H20 
SHOW." 
</P>
<P>
The original show cost about $500,000 to build and design, and Disney poured 
another $120,000 into the new production, Berkus said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fiber-optic wall and lighting system are semi-automated, Berkus is 
reluctant to turn the fountains over to a computer. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, how would we know when to automate when the show changes in 
subtle ways all the time?" Berkus mused. "At what point would we decide it was 
perfect?" 
</P>
<P>
The Dancing Waters operators agree. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always learning," Dave Hill said. "This way, we can still try something 
new, so the show gets better with age." 
</P>

CHAPMAN NAMES BOYD ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fortunes of Chapman College's financially troubled athletic department seem 
to rest more and more with Bob Boyd, who was hired Friday as the school's 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who was named the Panthers' basketball coach in March, has been the 
interim athletic director since May. He replaced Walt Bowman, who resigned in 
March and is now an associate athletic director at Cal State Fullerton and the 
executive director of the Titan Athletic Foundation, a fund-raising group. 
</P>
<P>
After conducting an informal search during the past four months, Jim Doti, 
Chapman's acting president, met with Boyd this week and offered him the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very fortunate to have Bob Boyd," Doti said. "He knows a lot of people. 
He's highly regarded and has roots in this community. The reputation he has 
established will serve us well." 
</P>
<P>
And "well" would mean increased contributions for the Chapman Athletic 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, 59, inherits a department that has been streamlined to consolidate its 
financial resources. Last January, the school dropped six sports and reduced 
the number of scholarships that will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Only baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball and women's volleyball are 
currently scholarship sports. And none of those sports will offer the maximum 
of 12 scholarships allowed in Division II programs by the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd' said his main goal will be to restore the scholarships to the NCAA 
maximum in all sports, saying it is essential that the school return to full 
scholarships if Chapman is to be competitive with the other schools in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to at least give each coach a fighting chance," Boyd said. "I feel the 
athletic director is responsible to his staff to give them the opportunity to 
win. As it is right now, it's quite a challenge for our teams to be competitive 
in the CCAA." 
</P>
<P>
The men's basketball team will have 10 players on scholarship next season, some 
of whom will have partial scholarships. The other sports may also divide their 
scholarship money to accommodate more athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said that a scholarship at Chapman is worth $15,630 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Chapman College has decided that those are, 'hard dollars,' " Boyd said. "They 
are not paper scholarships. The money has to be raised." 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman Athletic Fund covers approximately 20% of the athletic department's 
scholarship needs, Doti said. To meet Boyd's goal of full scholarships for 
every sport, the athletic fund would have to cover all costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is that, in four years, we'll be at the point where community support 
funds all our scholarships," Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who has a three-year contract worth about $60,000 a year, said he will 
not be in charge of fund raising, as Bowman was in the past. Boyd said his 
duties will be to coach basketball, recruit and take care of administrative 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
Don Anderson, who was hired as an associate athletic director in July, will 
head the athletic fund drive. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has worked with Boyd at Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) and at 
USC. Anderson was the sports information director at both schools while Boyd 
was the basketball coach. Boyd also was an associate athletic director at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great respect for Don's talent," Boyd said. "Before coming to 
Chapman, he had a sports marketing company that was quite successful." 
</P>
<P>
School officials are hopeful that Boyd will be a catalyst that helps the 
athletic department move forward financially. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Boyd is the focal-point of our department," Doti said.

Teen-ager Brandie Burton rallied from four holes down on the front nine to win 
1-up over Cathy Mockett, 21, of Newport Beach in a semifinal match of the U.S. 
Women's Amateur golf championship Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, 17, of Rialto, will meet Vicki Goetze, 16, of Hull, Ga., in today's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Goetze rolled in four birdies on her way to a 5-and-3 victory over former U.S. 
Amateur champion Carol Semple Thompson, of Sewickley, Pa, who did not win a 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-hole final is a rematch of last week's U.S. Girls' Junior semifinal in 
which Burton beat Goetze, 1-up, by making par on the last three holes. 
</P>
<P>
Burton went on to win the championship, setting up a chance to become the first 
player to win both events in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnne Gunderson Carner came the closest to winning both titles. In 1956 she 
won the Girls' Junior and finished second in the Women's Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
Burton started the day by losing four of the first seven holes to Mockett 
before knocking a three-iron within three feet and sinking the putt for an 
eagle 3 on the eighth hole. 
</P>
<P>
Burton pulled even with a birdie on the 15th and won with a 12-foot birdie putt 
on the par-3 17th. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Fiori shot a four-under-par 67 to take a two-stroke lead in the second round 
of the Federal Express St. Jude golf tournament at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Fiori, who shot an opening-round 65, was at 10-under-par 132, two strokes in 
front of Jim Gallagher, Bob Gilder and Billy Ray Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Tewell, who shot a course-record 63 Thursday, soared to a 75 and was six 
shots behind Fiori. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel made long birdie putts on the final two holes for a 66 and a 
one-stroke lead over Rosie Jones in the first round of the LPGA Greater 
Washington Open at Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, winless on the LPGA tour since 1985, had five birdies, including a 
45-foot putt on No. 17 and a 25-footer from off the fringe on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also had a bogey-free round over the 6,250-yard Bethesda Country Club 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Missy McGeorge was third after shooting a 68. Therese Hession birdied two of 
the last three holes for a 69. Leading money-winner Betsy King shot a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a bogey on the 18th hole, Gene Littler shot a five-under-par 67 for the 
first-round lead in the U.S. West Showdown Senior PGA Tour event at Jeremy 
Ranch, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass and Lou Graham were tied for second place at 68.

YALE LAW REVIEW MOVES STEP AWAY FROM 'TRADITIONAL DULLNESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY DORSEY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prevailing traditions at the Yale Law Journal have always lent its pages an air 
of academic monasticism, the appropriate stylelessness for sophisticated 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
With the July issue, however, the discerning eye will see a distinct change. Of 
course, the language retains the same clanging formality, and, between covers, 
the unillustrated pages remain as gray as headstones. But the footnotes? 
</P>
<P>
Your honor, we offer evidence of a creeping interest in life outside the 
cloister: 
</P>
<P>
(3) "L.A. Law" (NBC television broadcast, Jan. 12, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
(12) supra note 3, see Stark, "Perry Mason Meets Sonny Crockett." 
</P>
<P>
(19) S. Turow, "Presumed Innocent" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
(35) B. Berger &amp; R. Martinez, "What to Do With a Dead Lawyer" (1988, 
cartoons); "Skid Marks: Common Jokes About Lawyers" (Michael Rafferty ed. 
1988). 
</P>
<P>
Ed Swaine, formerly an editor of the Harvard Lampoon, admits to aiding and 
abetting in crimes against tradition. When he became this year's editor in 
chief of the journal, he envisioned a hologram on the cover, a pop-up in the 
center spread, a crossword puzzle, courtroom cartoons, and a bibliography of 
films and television shows about the profession. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a restrained, overtly serious version of his madcap fancies. But 
Swaine and his editors have produced a journal that they believe befits the top 
shelf of any lawyer's bathroom collection (costs prohibited it from having a 
leather binding, said Swaine, whose ambition once was to produce the journal's 
first coffee-table edition). 
</P>
<P>
Vol. 98, No. 8, is all about law and popular culture, and its premise is 
simple: "Many law professors experience vertigo when they open the doors and 
look outside appellate courtrooms," writes Prof. Stewart Macaulay of the 
University of Wisconsin in the introductory essay. "The functioning American 
legal system involves much that many law professors want to deny. If we 
mustered our courage and lifted our eyes from the pages of appellate reports 
and books written by famous dead Europeans, what might we see? Large areas of 
life are subject to private police, private rule-making and the sanctions 
generated by long-term continuing relationships." 
</P>
<P>
There is, essentially, as much to be discovered about the law and lawyers by 
watching television as by combing Supreme Court dicta. 
</P>
<P>
Thus: A freewheeling symposium on "The Depiction of Law in 'The Bonfire of the 
Vanities,' " "Taking 'L.A. Law' More Seriously," "An L.A. Lawyer Replies," 
"Law, Lawyers and Popular Culture." 
</P>
<P>
"It still looks like a law review," said Swaine, now an attorney with the 
solicitor general's office in Washington. "It has footnotes. The topics are 
written by legal scholars, and they don't betray a respect for legal 
scholarship. It would attempt to accomplish minor shifts in three areas: the 
conduct of law reviews themselves, the subject matter for legal academics and a 
refocus of attention outside the ivory towers. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't represent a sea change in attitude. But it may give vent to the 
ever-present spirit of subversiveness," Swaine said. 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of subversiveness has its own tradition at the law school, whose 
journal boasts 4,000 subscribers -- second only in circulation to the Harvard 
Journal of Law and Public Policy -- among university-based law reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Trend-watchers might wonder whether there is a subtle shift in the paradigm of 
law review editors nationwide. In 1987, for instance, the University of Miami 
Law Review printed "Perry Mason Meets Sonny Crockett: The History of Lawyers 
and the Police as Television Heroes." And in the past decade, the University of 
Pennsylvania Law Review published a parody on "The Common Law Origins of the 
Infield Fly Rule." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the editors are circumspect when confronted with the central 
question: "Is the Yale Law Journal Loosening Up?" 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it depends on what you mean by loosening up," replied Larry Garvin, 
the journal's managing editor, who also works in Washington for a private firm. 
"From the issues that we published before this, the answer would really have to 
be, probably, no. That's a qualified no. 
</P>
<P>
"Law journals seem to me to be moving a step or two away from their traditional 
dullness. Let me retract that word -- their traditional form. Dullness is a 
matter of taste." 
</P>
<P>
"Most have a comments section with shorter pieces, with fewer footnotes and 
more snappily written pieces and often addressing subjects of current interest. 
And I think that, generally, law journals will be moving in that direction -- 
shorter articles and fewer footnotes." 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it comes because of the way law journals work. The students, after 
all, have to check every blasted footnote, and this is not one of the most 
pleasant jobs in editing. This is also unusual as far as scholarship goes. I 
don't know why in law we have especially high standards and can't trust the 
people who write for us. . . . Boy, am I getting myself in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gutsy effort, the journal remains heavy with traditional 
hair-raisers: "Temporality and the Cultural Legitimation of Law," "Law as 
Microaggression" and "Lawyers and Legal Consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Swaine, however, takes his attempt at devoting an issue to popular culture with 
traditional Yalie aplomb, and refuses to admit he fell short of his goal. "It's 
not something for which we are temperamentally suited," he said, "and we don't 
have the skills necessary to carry off the kind of cultural criticism that this 
may demand. It was not my ambition to lead a revolution from within. Top-down 
revolutions are not very successful." 
</P>
<P>
"Skid Marks: Common Jokes About Lawyers," the Rafferty book that the Yale Law 
Journal uses in its July issue, it is a compendium of gags and jokes collected 
from friends and solicitations from advertisements in two California 
newspapers. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the difference between a dead skunk and a dead lawyer in the 
middle of the road? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are skid marks before the skunk. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you call 2,000 lawyers chained together at the bottom of the sea? 
</P>
<P>
A: A good beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do medical laboratories now use lawyers instead of rats? 
</P>
<P>
A: They breed faster, are less likable and do things that rats won't do. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the difference between a lawyer and a rooster, or a porcupine and 
two lawyers in a Porsche? 
</P>
<P>
A: (Issues of obscenity prohibit this question from being answered in this 
space.)

A CHAMPION FOR THE AGED; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY DIRECTOR SOLVES INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS, FIGHTS FOR LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voice on the other end of the line was a cry for help -- from a desperate, 
frightened, 75-year-old man trapped in a financial and bureaucratic maze. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife had lived for years in their comfortably middle-class Orange 
County home. Now he was alone. He had put his wife, incapacitated by illness, 
into a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Then another disaster struck: The $1,800-a-month cost of the long-term care 
wasn't covered by their Medicare or private insurance. And he was going broke, 
their life savings in danger of vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, told by other senior citizens that the Area Agency on Aging might be 
able to help, he called that office, Orange County's official coordinator of 
senior citizen programs. 
</P>
<P>
And he found a sympathetic ear. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, agency director Peggy Weatherspoon, who took the call herself, 
remembers the man's financial plight as the kind that could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new state law, the couple could divide their assets. The husband was 
protected from becoming impoverished, while the wife's share could be used to 
pay nursing bills until she dropped to the poverty level and became eligible 
for Medi-Cal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, this case, was "a real heartbreaker," Weatherspoon says, one that 
typifies the approach the Area Agency on Aging takes in all its cases. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply: "We try to give them help, of course, and if we can't, we try to 
find someone who can. You never turn your back on the people. You never hang up 
on them. You listen. You care. You go to bat for them. We're there as their 
friends -- and their voices to the rest of society." 
</P>
<P>
As director of the Area Agency on Aging the past eight years, Weatherspoon, 41, 
is at the cutting edge of senior programs and activism in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, by its directly administered or contracted services, reaches up to 
33,000 seniors a year through programs involving hot meals, shared housing, 
senior day care, transportation and independent living. The projects are 
considered models by state officials and others in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 And Weatherspoon, known for her advocacy, enthusiasm and administrative tact, 
is highly regarded by leaders in the county's senior community, including the 
agency's own Senior Citizens Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
Since she entered the field 13 years ago as a graduate student in USC's 
nationally respected Andrus School of Gerontology, she has witnessed dramatic 
expansion in militant senior organizations, social research on aging and the 
elderly, and the nationwide network of 670 federally sponsored Area Agencies on 
Aging. 
</P>
<P>
Demographic realities are one obvious reason. Americans are living longer, and 
the post-World War II baby boom generation, now in their 30s and 40s, will be 
confronting their own old age. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon cites the latest nationwide projections by a team of USC and 
National Institute of Aging researchers: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1985 the average life expectancy was 71.2 for men and 78.2 for women. By 
2040 the predicted averages are 85.9 for men and 91.6 for women. 
</P>
<P>
* Also by 2040, the 65-and-older population will be 87 million, triple the 
current total. Seniors may then compose 20% to 25% of the overall U.S. 
population; the 1980 figure was 11.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County statistics are just as striking, Weatherspoon says. The 
60-and-over population is now 325,125, or 14.3% of the total county population; 
the 1980 figure was 221,584, or 11.5%. The projections by the year 2020: 
767,465, or 25.2%. 
</P>
<P>
This will mean, Weatherspoon says, a new kind of population phenomenon in 
America -- "one that runs counter to all those myths about 'old age' and the 
youth mentality that still dominates our society." 
</P>
<P>
A sweeping retooling of American society, she says, will be in order to meet 
new demands in housing, employment, consumer and leisure needs of the vast 
"healthly, fully active" senior population. 
</P>
<P>
But the rising political clout of seniors, she adds, will also be required to 
press for a "massive regrouping of public and private resources" to meet 
long-term care needs -- whether in facilities or in the home -- of chronically 
ill seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if the past few decades have reflected America's baby boom era, she says, 
then the next few decades will be marked by yet another trend -- the senior 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that Weatherspoon, herself a baby boomer, had started out with the 
common stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with the old myths, that being old always meant being decrepit and 
doomed to a dead-end existence," says Weatherspoon, who was born in Tulare, one 
of five children in a San Joaquin Valley farming family. 
</P>
<P>
"I only saw the down side of aging, like seeing older people in restaurants 
being spoon-fed. I was horrified that this was the way all of us would end up. 
It never occurred to me that there was this other side -- the quality of life, 
dignity and vitality that older people can enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Then Weatherspoon, a psychology major at Cal State Dominquez Hills, was shaken 
by an incident that was to change her life personally and professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone in the (college) office was looking at this magazine cartoon -- 
mocking an elderly couple trying to have sex in bed," she says. "Everyone began 
to snicker -- including me. 
</P>
<P>
"But this other office worker, a woman in her 60s, burst into tears. She said, 
'Why do you young people think this is so damn funny!' " 
</P>
<P>
Deeply moved, Weatherspoon, who had been thinking of entering the child 
psychology field, from then on focused on studying the elderly, even writing a 
class paper on their sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
It was her field work as a USC graduate intern -- including a project that took 
her to the senior hotels in the MacArthur Park area of Los Angeles -- that most 
changed her attitudes. "I met seniors who lived in tiny rooms with just a bed 
and a hot plate -- people who were alone and suffering from physical and social 
hardships. But they still had a passion for life, were still proud of their 
independence. They were not people to feel sorry for." 
</P>
<P>
She became an Orange County gerontologist in 1976 and then a mental health 
specialist on alcohol abuse -- before being hired in 1980 to direct the 
county's Area Agency on Aging. Today, in her $58,000-a-year post, she oversees 
30 staff aides and 24 contracted private providers. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon says the agency, currently a $9-million operation supported mostly 
by federal money as well as state, county and private funds, offers programs 
that emphasize reaching the "economically and socially needy" -- such as the 
impoverished, the "home-bound fragile" and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Senior Citizens Information and Referral Office, the agency's telephone 
service in the county complex at 1300 S. Grand Ave. in Santa Ana, handles up to 
1,200 calls a month, chiefly for information on medical assistance, bus 
services, affordable housing and home-maker aides. (Information office: (714) 
567-7500, central county; (714) 220-0366, west, and (714) 768-5615, south.) 
</P>
<P>
Other services directly administered by the agency include coordinating 15 
"shared housing" programs, which have placed nearly 900 applicants this year; a 
"case management" program in which a team of professional aides monitors meals, 
doctor visits and related functions for 200 "highly fragile" seniors, and an 
ombudsman service to handle referrals and complaints about nursing homes and 
other long-term-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's largest program is the hot-meal service contracted with three 
private organizations -- including the widely known Feedback Foundation -- 
providing up to 6,000 meals a day at senior centers and for shut-in residents. 
Other contracted services include bus transportation, senior day-care centers, 
employment referrals and legal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Contract organizations and other leaders in the senior community maintain that 
agency-affiliated programs are among the best in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran senior advocates like Shirley Cohen, who directs the Feedback 
Foundation, credit this in part to "a supportive countywide network," including 
the County Board of Supervisors, which governs the Area Agency on Aging, and 
the agency's Senior Citizens Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon also gets her share of the credit. "She's a very effective 
communicator and director," Cohen says. "She has the empathy (for seniors) and 
professional background. She gets along with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
H. Ross Miller, the advisory council's vice president, whose ties with the 
county agency date back to its founding in 1974, puts it this way: "Peggy's an 
outstanding, very warm kind of person. We're lucky to have her. And she really 
goes out and fights for seniors." 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon, Weatherspoon was between meetings in the day's round. She had 
returned the evening before from another trip to Sacramento to press for new 
senior-related legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, her thoughts were on the latest battles: the pursuit of more 
government financing for new or expanded programs and the lobbying for federal 
long-term-care insurance that would cover the overwhelming costs of nursing and 
similar facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The fight goes on, too, she says, to shatter old myths. "People still think 
most seniors are senile and completely helpless. The truth is that only 5% are 
senile -- and about 20% are after age 85." She turned to a window sill, where 
she keeps her photographic mementos. Next to a snapshot of her husband, Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon, is a photo of her with her 
advocacy idol, Claude Pepper, the late Florida congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Pepper, who died in May at age 88 after being hospitalized for treatment of 
cancer, was the most celebrated legislative champion of senior citizen causes, 
including attempts to expand Medicare coverage to include long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
"Claude Pepper was a perfect role model for all of us," Weatherspoon says, "the 
personification of a senior who had not lost his dignity or mental vitality, 
who maintained his quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
And Pepper, whom she met when he visited Orange County in 1984, was a special 
inspiration to her as an advocate, she says softly. "To me, he was a fighter."

<P>
In a room filled with toys, games, dolls and kids, the intravenous machines 
were an ever-present reminder that the matter at hand was serious. 
</P>
<P>
But the message Wednesday in the cancer ward at Childrens Hospital of Orange 
County was one of optimism and cheer, not of gloomy prognoses for the assembled 
children, ages 2 to 11, with cancer or blood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The guest of honor was Jason Gaes, an 11-year-old Minnesota boy who told nine 
other young cancer patients and some of their relatives about his own 
successful battle with cancer -- a rare form that doctors told him five years 
ago could kill him within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dying, Jason has hit the kiddie lecture circuit as the result of the 
book he wrote, "My Book for Kids With Cansur." He was inspired to write it, he 
said, because a book his teacher had given him about a boy's cancer ended with 
the child dying. 
</P>
<P>
Jason wanted something with a happier ending, so he put down his thoughts about 
it in a yellow notebook, which he showed to his parents. They promptly set it 
down on top of the refrigerator before getting around to reading it that night. 
</P>
<P>
When they did, said his mother, Geralyn, who joined Jason at Childrens 
Hospital, they were stunned by the poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
A sample from the book, published by Melius &amp; Peterson Publishing Inc. of 
Aberdeen, S.D.: "Sometimes keymotharupy makes you sick and you throw up. 
Sometimes you looz your hair from it, but you can wear hats if it bothers you. 
Mostly kids don't care when your bald. And if they laff or make fun there not 
very good friends anyway. Some kids think its cool." 
</P>
<P>
The publishers decided to leave the book in the original form in which Jason 
wrote it, misspellings and all, to maintain its authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the youngsters who met Jason at Childrens Hospital were too young 
to understand his message, others were not. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Johnson, 11, of Trabuco Canyon, wanted to know what kind of chemotherapy 
Jason had undergone. When Jason's mother identified the five treatments with 
their complex medical names, Jeremy nodded knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
Jason, who looked at times during the session like an 11-year-old who would 
rather be outside playing, yielded most of the speaking chores to his mother. 
But he told the youngsters, "Even though doctors might say you're not doing 
well, you've got to keep on trying to beat it." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he plans to become a doctor specializing in child cancer so he can 
tell patients that he once knew what it was like "being the only bald kid in 
the whole town." 
</P>
<P>
If he does become a doctor, he may have to look no further than his own book 
for bedside manner. Another excerpt: "When your bald you dont have to worry 
about getting shampoo in your eyes when your sick from a treetment you get to 
stay home from school and when your done having cansur you get to have a big 
party. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple bad parts about having cansur too. There's blood tests. I 
got used to those so I could go in by myself but if your scared of blood tests 
have your Mom or Dad cover your eyes. If you can't see the needle it doesn't 
hurt as much as if your sister pinches you. And you don't cry everytime you get 
pinched do you?" 
</P>
<P>
Jason's mother, who said family members have crisscrossed the country the last 
couple years from their Worthington, Minn., home to visit hospitals, said, 
"Public awareness about cancer is very negative." 
</P>
<P>
With other illnesses or accidents, she said, the word victim is usually 
reserved for people who die. But people with cancer are often referred to as 
victims, she said. The publicity surrounding Jason's touring, she said, is an 
opportunity to let people know about "the tremendous strides being made in 
treatment and research. If they need any proof of that, it's Jason. If anyone 
should have died, it was him. He was full of it." 
</P>
<P>
First diagnosed in 1984, Jason had five tumors -- in his mouth, stomach, left 
eye and kidneys. He underwent treatment for two years and has been pronounced 
free of the disease, according to information provided by the family. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Jason is aware of cancer's deadly potential. Jason, who will be a 
sixth-grader this year and is one of four Gaes children, included this passage 
near the end of the book: 
</P>
<P>
"My mother said when me and Tim (his twin brother) was babys in her stumick we 
liked it in there so good the dr had to give my Mom a shot to make us come out. 
But now that I'm outside I wouldn't never want to go back. She says going to 
heaven is probly like that. Once we get there we won't want to come back here. 
</P>
<P>
"We'r just scared about going to heaven because we never been there. You can 
see your Grandpa again and pretty soon your Mom will be there too." 
</P>
<P>
The Gaes family's visit to Orange County was sponsored by the Ronald McDonald 
House, a home away from home for young cancer patients. The facility, now under 
construction, is scheduled to open next year on a site a few blocks from 
Childrens Hospital.

DISCOVERY: RED CAR MUSEUM: SEAL BEACH'S BIG 'RED CAR'

<P>
To view the most extensive collection of memorabilia from Seal Beach's past, 
one need only step aboard a restored Pacific Electric Railway "red car." The 
unique Red Car Museum houses photographs, clothing, shells and other items 
collected over the years that detail the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
The "red cars" themselves are an important part of Seal Beach's development. 
When the Pacific Electric Railway reached Bay City (now Seal Beach) in 1904, 
those who lived in the inland parts of Orange County could begin to visit the 
coastal areas by rail. Although the seaside route would eventually extend from 
Long Beach to Newport Beach, it was the lure of Seal Beach's "Fun Zone" -- an 
amusement area complete with Ferris wheel and other rides -- that brought 
thousands of sightseers from throughout the area flocking to the city via the 
"red cars." 
</P>
<P>
One of the cars was purchased by the Seal Beach Historical Society in 1976 and 
placed where it now sits in Heritage Square, according to Barbara Rountree, 
president of the Seal Beach Historical Society. Originally a "tower" (work car) 
that serviced the Pacific Electric Railway lines, Car No. 1734 opened as a 
museum in 1981 after a lengthy restoration by local volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Items on view in the museum include a collection of shells found on Seal Beach, 
some dating back 45 years, Indian artifacts discovered on Marina Hill, and more 
than 1,000 photographs of historical interest dating from 1888 to 1960. There 
is also a rare collection of photographs, books and magazines from and about 
the Pacific Electric Railway. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to be very local in what we gather," Rountree said. "We realized 
that if we ourselves did not collect things (from Seal Beach's history), no one 
would." 
</P>
<P>
The historical society is currently going through 30 boxes of writings and 
items to be used to put together an oral history of Seal Beach. When finished, 
it will be housed in the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Hours:The museum is open to the public from 1 to 5 p.m. the second and fourth 
Saturdays of each month. It is also open by appointment to any interested 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Address: Heritage Square, Electric Avenue and Main Street, Seal Beach
