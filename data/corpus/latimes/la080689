THE BODY'S MEMORY BY JEAN STEWART (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.95; 272 PP.)

"I remember the moment I discovered, at age 10 in 1957, that not everyone in 
America had freedom of choice when it came to such commonplace acts as riding 
buses and trains. (My parents had just bought their first television set and I, 
awed, sat glued to the screen for weeks.) I knew that such things were 
possible, that freedom could be taken away, having pored through Anne Frank's 
diary. But that was Germany, and history. It seemed unimaginable that some 
Americans were made to ride separate buses, attend separate schools and 
churches, sit in separate sections way in the back of the movie theaters, and 
enter through separate doors. A special kind of anger, a receptivity, was born 
in me then." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker is Kate, a teacher in her 30s who lives on Long Island, the 
protagonist of Jean Stewart's "A Body's Memory." She is a bright, independent 
woman who now -- 20 years after first learning of the civil rights movement -- 
has herself become the target of discrimination. Race, however, is not the 
issue; she is discriminated against for a different reason, because she is 
recently disabled, dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with insurmountable steps and curbs, narrow doorways, broken 
elevators, inquisitive stares and pitying looks that establish her as separate, 
Kate understands what it means to be denied access to the world, to be set 
apart, to be deemed unemployable and lose a much-needed job, to have to accept 
public welfare, to be different and experience a particular kind of isolating 
loneliness because of that difference. Each day that one lives with any kind of 
discrimination, she comes to see, is a day turned into a battle against anger 
and despair and numbing self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Page after page of this book chronicles that battle in its various forms and 
stages. In a preface, Stewart stresses that this book is a work of fiction 
related "only obliquely" to events in her own life. Clearly that oblique slice 
of the story is a big one. The novel rings terribly true and is all the more 
affecting for it. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the characters in "The Body's Memory" are disabled, and it does become 
a very specific topic, presenting a character with a singular -- albeit 
terribly important -- crisis, and though the emphasis occasionally threatens to 
maroon the story on a single track, the author ultimately succeeds in writing 
about many things endemic to that crisis -- friendships, for instance, and 
courage, and self-discovery, in very strong and confident prose. It is a first 
novel, and like many first novels, the story of a rite of passage. 
</P>
<P>
The novel unfolds through journal entries and letters and opens with Kate in 
the hospital, facing surgery for the second time. A cancerous tumor has 
reappeared on her hip: 
</P>
<P>
"Cancer . . . I say it often . . . though my friends tiptoe around the word. . 
. . I say it and listen to its reverberations. I roll it around my mouth like a 
grape, to taste it, let it burst upon my senses." 
</P>
<P>
The surgery destroys muscle and bone, leaving her unable to walk unassisted. 
Initially Kate refuses to consider a wheelchair. A wheelchair seems the final 
humiliation. Forearm crutches, however, aren't much better. The metal bands 
encircling her arms pinch her flesh, and the attempt to walk with them leaves 
her exhausted and in constant pain until the wheelchair begins to look like a 
more endurable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to live alone, Kate refuses offers to move in with friends and 
begins the long, arduous process of adapting to her disability. "Nighttime is 
particularly confusing," she writes to a friend. "When sunlight scatters from 
the rooms, and my leg is dizzy with pain from trying to pretend it can do 
anything, and I crawl between the sheets and the vastly empty bed unfurls 
around me, I feel that other darkness encroaching on the sturdy, safe daytime 
world. It's hard not to panic, then. . . . I do seem to be proving what I set 
out to prove: that I can live alone. The question begins to reshape itself: At 
what price?" 
</P>
<P>
The price, as it turns out, is high. Disability takes its toll in many eroding 
ways. Kate loses her job, her lover, her sense of herself as attractive and 
capable. "Men seem particularly bemused by the sight of me," she writes, "as if 
they expect disabled women to be asexual." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes her very sanity seems endangered as Kate goes through the cycle of 
illness, anger, acceptance, adaptation. She endures radiation treatments, a 
word that recalls the bomb shelters and air raid drills of the '50s. In fact, 
her world has gone slightly mad. Panic, grief, despair cannot be dismissed by 
Kate or her friends Ellen, Peter, Jeremy and Beth, much as they try to help 
her. In a climactic and horrifying scene, Kate's new lover, Carl, informs her 
that he's tired of carrying her upstairs to his bedroom and having to act the 
part of a nurse. Her reaction is to throw her wheelchair down a flight of 
stairs, and then herself, only to be brutally sexually assaulted even as she is 
lying face down with broken bones from the fall. What can happen to this woman? 
a reader might ask. What can she find for herself, and how will she find it? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that she can get angry enough to dissolve the self-pity blocking 
her path. She can seek the company of other disabled people, people who will 
understand her emotional status, and she can assert herself in many ordinary 
situations, just as her civil rights predecessors did. Kate undergoes a 
transformation from victim to activist, from an angry, suffering woman to a 
crusader working on behalf of all people's understanding. It's a thoroughly 
credible development, and it gives the novel a fine resolved ending, even if 
the reader does get the telegraphed and slightly sentimentalized sense that it 
was the only possible ending. 
</P>
<P>
The novel concludes on a particularly strong note with a description of Kate 
confronting the sea, at the same beach where she once attempted suicide with 
pills. She now crawls into the brine like some prehistoric sea beast making its 
return journey, in order to take one of her now-frequent and long solo swims, 
and recalls an earlier incident. 
</P>
<P>
"She was swimming out toward open sea one day when she came upon a small 
fishing boat. In it sat a lone Greek who stared down, open-mouthed. He turned 
and peered in all directions, looking for her boat, but his was the only one in 
sight. At last recovering speech, careful not to offend, he ventured, polite, 
his voice thickly Greek: 'Are you . . . drowning?' 
</P>
<P>
"Kate smiled up at him. 'No. I'm swimming,' she said." Here is the evidence of 
the triumph so notable in this work.

SALVAGING THE SOCIALIST DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIALISM PRESENT &amp; FUTURE BY MICHAEL HARRINGTON (ARCADE PUBLISHING: 
$19.95; 320 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead and Mead is the author of "Mortal Splendor: The American 
Empire in Transition" (Houghton Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cold War is over, and the winner is . . . Sweden. "Socialism: Present &amp; 
Future" is the book that tells you why. 
</P>
<P>
As Eastern Europe emerges from the shadows of communism, its peoples are 
rushing to embrace the economic system now firmly entrenched in most of the 
democratic nations of Europe. The Poles, the Hungarians, the Czechs and their 
neighbors want to combine the economic dynamism of American capitalism with the 
meager but durable social security that has been the one achievement of 
socialism Soviet-style. The middle way between these two extremes? Democratic 
socialism as practiced in Western Europe: Sweden, indeed, but other countries 
as well, including Germany, France and even Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The trend is not spreading to Eastern Europe alone. In Asia, the Chinese people 
are attempting to reach this fusion system from a government well to its left, 
and the South Koreans and the Filipinos are trying to reach it from the right. 
Japan may be the most striking case of all. In "Japan, Inc.," government 
authority over private enterprise has been, by American standards, unsettlingly 
socialist and outrageously successful. Now, with the victory of declared 
socialists at the Japanese polls, that country is clearly taking a further step 
toward the international center. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show that Americans, too, want this mixed economy. We want more and 
better health care, better government services for the aged, the infirm and the 
homeless. We want cleaner air, longer vacations, better schools and more child 
care -- but we don't want to lose our economic or personal freedom to get them. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington was a lifelong student of the tradition of democratic 
socialism and, as chairperson of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), 
was a member of the Socialist International on a par with such European figures 
as Willy Brandt and Francois Mitterrand. In "Socialism: Present &amp; Future," 
the crowning achievement of a distinguished career, Harrington moves between 
the theoretical and the political aspects of this middle way to create a book 
of startling insight. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist theory is a complicated subject, one that does not endear itself to 
American readers. It mostly concerns people with strange names in far-off 
countries arguing about such gripping topics as the epistemological 
underpinnings of the Hegelian dialectic and the political implications of 
Bismarck's social insurance legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to follow Harrington's pellucid 
narration. This is a book about socialism for people who think that Gramsci is 
a kind of hot antipasto, and that Rosa Luxemburg is the name of a town. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a book that will cause pain to dogmatists of every stripe. 
Harrington has no patience for the cult-like orthodoxy found among so many 
schools of political economy. Like John Kenneth Galbraith, whose ironic, 
elegant prose finds echoes here, Harrington delights in pricking the 
self-esteem of the smugly dogmatic. The free-market theorist who despises all 
forms of state interference and the dogmatic socialist who wants to nationalize 
everything in sight will find little to like in this book. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington does not bother with cheap shots in his book; he takes on big 
questions and big thinkers. His attack on Lenin's version of Marxism is tough 
and penetrating, and Marx himself comes in for extensive reappraisal. While 
hailing Marx's humane and democratic ideals, Harrington argues that Marx was 
mistaken to believe that he had discovered a "scientific socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Marx believed -- passionately -- that he had purged socialism of the naive and 
unrealistic elements found in the work of men like Fourier, Robert Owens and 
Saint-Simone. These thinkers had all envisioned future utopias in which the 
lion would lie down with the lamb, physical and mental labor would be shared by 
all members of the community, crabgrass would no longer grow, and the rivers of 
the world would run with lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
Marx tried to get rid of what he saw as sentimental claptrap and to base 
socialist politics on objective laws of historical development. The result may 
have been a more realistic political program, but Harrington believes Marx was 
wrong to try to divorce socialism from the utopian dream, much less to think he 
had succeeded in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong to try, because the idealistic dreams of the utopian socialists 
represent values not to be forgotten; the barbarity of Stalinism shows what can 
happen when socialists murder their dreams. Marx was wrong to think he had 
succeeded because, for all his hard-nosed scientism, he was a dreamer whose 
faith in a better future motivated him and his disciples. 
</P>
<P>
John Lennon, then, more closely epitomizes Harrington's vision of the ideal 
socialist dreamer than Vladimir Lenin; "Imagine" is a better anthem for the 
movement Harrington has in mind than "The Internationale," the traditional 
socialist anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Though the socialist dream is alive and well in Sweden, problems remain, 
Harrington says. For two generations, Swedish socialists and their counterparts 
in Germany, France and elsewhere in Europe have been quietly assembling and 
fitting together the pieces of a way of life more humane but no less free than 
anything our long-suffering species has seen to date. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all is not well in the world of democratic socialism. 
</P>
<P>
The ossified bureaucracies of the welfare state and the unproductive behemoths 
into which many nationalized industries have turned have led to recent attacks 
on the democratic socialist movement. From the right come the Thatcherites, 
claiming that nationalizations are inherently inefficient, and that welfare 
corrupts donor and recipient. From the nontraditional left come movements like 
feminism and "Green" environmentalism with acerbic and often trenchant 
criticisms of the socialist tradition. 
</P>
<P>
As Harrington considers the future of democratic socialism, he acknowledges the 
substantial accuracy of these critiques. The socialism of the 21st Century, he 
believes, will be more open to markets, sensitive to feminist and other 
minority concerns, and allied with the ecology movement. 
</P>
<P>
Americans will feel that this "Socialism of the 21st Century" sounds like the 
Rainbow Coalition -- and they will have a point. But for Harrington, the 
Rainbow Coalition is more a rough draft than a blueprint. Harrington belongs to 
a rare breed -- the American political intellectual. Mass movements and 
charismatic leaders -- even when they come from his own side of the political 
spectrum -- do not so much make him nervous as they bring out the teacher in 
him. Movements of protest and for social change need a grounding in history and 
political theory. 
</P>
<P>
This is where Harrington believes that the broad and quarrelsome stream of 
socialist intellectual tradition has its place. American social reformers 
should know more than they often do about the history of political experiments 
in other countries. They sorely lack the seasoning and hands-on experience that 
participation in government has given to generations of European socialists and 
may soon give the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
In "Socialism: Present &amp; Future," Harrington has produced a book that gives 
American readers the best available guide to this rich and complex tradition. 
Every American concerned about the direction of our country should read this 
book -- and so, too, should everyone interested in the political trends that 
shape the politics of our most important allies. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, this is a book about hope. Hope for a better tomorrow, hope 
for the peaceful resolution of international conflict, hope that the human 
spirit can rise above petty fears and squabbles to fulfill its age-old dreams. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a personal statement. Harrington began this book on the day he 
received a diagnosis of cancer; last week, word came of his death. It is 
typical of Harrington that, faced with a crisis of this magnitude, he would 
produce an optimistic book of social theory; typical, too, that the effort 
under such circumstances would bring such magnificent results.

<P>
Over the course of five years, the hard-boiled NBC police series "Hunter" has 
softened its rough edges and steadily risen in the Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Last season "Hunter" often landed among Nielsen's Top 15 shows. When the series 
returns for a new season in September, its fans can expect to see further 
fine-tuning. That's when Fred Dryer, who portrays homicide detective Rick 
Hunter, and his partner Lawrence Kubik will become executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
Dryer, whose co-star Stepfanie Kramer plays Sgt. Dee Dee McCall, plans to 
reduce the number of car chases and fights in favor of more character 
development and stories that will focus on the "human condition." 
</P>
<P>
No changes in the supporting cast or time slot, however. Charles Hallahan will 
be back as police captain Charles Devane, with Garrett Morris serving as 
Hunter's informant Sporty James each Saturday at 10 p.m.

WHO WHISPERED NEAR ME BY KILLARNEY CLARY (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $14.95; 
66 PP.; 0-374-28983-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ian Gregson, Gregson, a British poet, is a winner of the Gregory Award. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Killarney Clary is in her mid-30s and has lived all her life in Pasadena. This 
is her first collection. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Whispered Near Me" is like a journal in the sense that it moves from 
accounts of small daily experiences to meditations and memories. It's written 
in dense, mostly short passages of prose poetry. 
</P>
<P>
In its allusions to the journal idiom it's reminiscent of those poems by Frank 
O'Hara that are self-consciously framed by a time and place (as in "The Day 
Lady Died": "It is 12:20 in New York a Friday/ . . . it is 1959"). Though she 
doesn't give the datelines as O'Hara does she's just as interested as he was in 
a diaristic voice and particularity. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of writing gives a vivid sense of place so that just as O'Hara's 
poems evoke New York, Clary's evoke Southern California. In this way the book 
constantly arouses that feeling, which accompanies having lived in a place a 
long time, of constantly encountering previous selves scattered across the 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It's the interaction between time and self and place that the journal idiom is 
especially good at suggesting. The sense that days are where we live, that 
moment-by-moment our minds move between introspection and interpreting our 
surroundings, and that as these moments accumulate we change. 
</P>
<P>
For O'Hara the journal analogy is joined by the telephone analogy. In his joke 
manifesto "Personism," he says that he was once writing a poem to someone he 
loved and that "while I was writing it I was realizing that if I wanted to I 
could use the telephone instead of writing the poem." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Clary's poems, too, made me think I'd picked up the phone and caught a 
stranger in mid-flow -- they have that sense of mysterious context, narrative 
undercurrent, unexplained names. 
</P>
<P>
It's partly this sense of something torn from context that makes "Who Whispered 
Near Me" a modernist work. If it's a diary, then crucial pages are missing; if 
a phone call, it's only intermittently audible. 
</P>
<P>
This gives it the fragmentariness of modernism -- the lack of the beginning, 
middle and end we expect from realism and a deliberate refusal of the realist 
sense that we occupy similar worlds, that a consensus can be created between 
writer and reader. The fragmentariness suggests that our experience comes to us 
in a baffling order and that other people's minds are alien places. 
</P>
<P>
So Clary makes a reference to the telephone analogy -- the poem as phone call 
to a loved one -- to suggest how the poet's words can get scrambled on the 
line: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm irritable on the phone, feel I'm supposed to entertain you, but I've had a 
stupid day and my only thought is full of complaint. You're tired, and the 
delay on the long-distance line causes us to interrupt each other and to say 
with a harsh edge, "I can't hear you; I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But Clary's fragmentariness produces more meaning, not less. The suppressing of 
narrative (and even syntactical) links, and the switching around of narrative 
sequence, produce revealing juxtapositions and a vivid abruptness -- the sense 
of an idea or image emerging with disconcerting suddenness: 
</P>
<P>
 The girls in the office are afraid of Lynn's ghost. She'd been there, alive, 
working at her desk last week. I was only angry. A cough like a dog that won't 
be shut out. Her body, finally. Be a ghost at least, Lynn, not so far away -- 
heaven or nowhere -- not so different. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Because this passage is presented without a defining context, "A cough like a 
dog that won't be shut out" could have a narrative meaning -- perhaps one of 
Lynn's symptoms was a recurrent cough. Equally, though, it could be a simile 
referring back to the poet's anger and forward to Lynn's body. The anger is an 
internal irritant, like a cough, or something instinctive that won't be turned 
away, like a dog. Lynn's body is now a ghost returning as an internal 
disturbance, like a cough, or a homesick creature, like a dog. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, "not so different" could be a parallel plea to "not so far 
away" -- a plea to Lynn not to leave altogether -- or it could be suggesting 
that heaven is nowhere, that it doesn't exist -- so don't try to go there. 
</P>
<P>
There's more, though, to Clary than modernism. 
</P>
<P>
She's clearly connected to that tradition in women's poetry that's been coming 
more clearly into focus in the last 20 years. This is a matter of distinct 
preoccupations, and a differently inflected language, from the male tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's connected to an explicit allegiance to feminine precursors, and 
sometimes, as in Clary's case, to a feminine rereading of the male tradition. 
She sounds, occasionally, like a late 20th-Century female Whitman. Moreover, 
one of the central concerns of the book is an exploration of Clary's 
relationships with her sister, her mother, female childhood friends, female 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
And Clary has another tradition behind her, more surprising than either 
modernism or feminism. "Who Whispered Near Me" sometimes seems to echo the 
journals of Emerson and Thoreau, and like their journals, it is in a sense 
addressed to God -- though she is less convinced than them that He exists. Some 
of her poems-as-phone-calls are attempted prayers ("I want a solution. So, 
'God,' I pray, 'finish this one unwavering note, at any cost, song or silence' 
."). 
</P>
<P>
But like Gerard Manley Hopkins she worries that her prayers are "dead letters": 
"And when I don't pray, I whine, 'Why should I send a letter to my friend who 
won't answer?'."

RESONATING BODIES BY LYNNE ALEXANDER (ATHENEUM: $18.95; 230 PP.; 0-698-12039-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Eric Larsen, Larsen's novel, An American Memory, will appear in paper this 
fall from Anchor Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynne Alexander, herself once a professional harpsichordist, has taken two 
characters (a talking cello and an aging English musician at the end of his 
long career), given them alternating chapters in which to tell the stories of 
their lives, and has thereby created something very like a piece of music 
itself in this wonderfully skilled, delightfully ambitious, and quietly moving 
novel (Alexander's second, following the widely praised "Safe Houses." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Jordan is the musician, an internationally acclaimed baroque 
revivalist now 72 years old, troubled by ill health, and still tormented by his 
recent decision to retire from performing ("For the first time in his life, he 
had taken a safe, slow tempo in the Bach D Major. It was his cue to leave"). As 
the novel takes place, the uneasy Nicholas sits in the audience in the Salon 
d'Apollon at Versailles, listening to a concert in which his protege and chosen 
successor performs -- doing so on the instrument that he has given her, the 
very instrument that he himself has possessed, performed on, and lived with for 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
And what an instrument it is -- or she is -- speaking to Nicholas as the 
concert proceeds, and listening to his thoughts in return. She's not really a 
cello at all, but, as she tells us, "I am Rose, Viola da Gamba, of the family 
Viols, noble in size and shape. Like the cello, I am held between the legs: da 
gamba. Unlike the cello, however, which often has a metal tail on which it 
leans (causing unsightly damage to wooden floors), I rest on nothing but the 
inner calves, and to these I transmit my full sonority." 
</P>
<P>
Rose's story alone (hold the miracle of her voice for later) is a thing 
beguiling. It's a story unobtrusively told by Alexander -- from Rose's 
beginning in 1670 in the Paris workshop of Christophe Bernard. He created her, 
the most lovely of the seven-string viols, as a wedding gift for his wife; she, 
however, died in childbirth before Rose's completion. Beautiful, modest, 
touched from the start by love and by her awareness of mortality, Rose made her 
way through the next two centuries, had a piece composed in her honor (the lost 
"Apotheosis of the Bernard Viol"), was played by the loathsome and 
puritanically repressed Cornelius Graswinkel, was painted by Vermeer and owned 
by the pudgy and passionless Roger North in England. She found her way to the 
French court where she was played at Versailles by the brilliant Marin Marais, 
later by the demonic genius Antoine Forqueray -- all of this (and more) in a 
life's journey that was to see her barely survive the fiery cataclysm of the 
French Revolution, find her (out of fashion) moldering first in a museum and 
then in a pawn shop in Paris. Her discovery there by Arnold Dolmetsch would 
lead at last (after still more confusion, adulteration, and abuse) to her being 
bought at an auction in London by one Harry Jordan for his passionately 
desiring 12-year-old son Nicholas. 
</P>

And who was this strange, only child of odd parents (his father was to 
disappear forever soon after buying the viol), with his single-minded passion 
to have, and play, Rose? He was, to put it plainly, her lover and savior, as 
she was his. His love for her ("his Rose, who . . . responded to the lightest 
touch. How he loved her, her smooth surface, the hollow depths of her, the 
delicate contours of her body") was equal only to hers for him ("Mount me, hold 
me, string me, tune me") -- and between the two of them, these resonating 
bodies would be created, again and again, through great passion, the wonder of 
enormous beauty, not to mention huge renown and material success ("Imagine," 
says Rose at one point, "Forqueray at the top of the hit parade"). 
</P>
<P>
And what is the real question the novel takes up? Alexander's graceful 
learnedness, subtlety, and range -- as well as her humor and shrewdly 
penetrating eye -- allow questions galore to come up, but at the heart of it 
all lies a tale about the human cost of the life lived for beauty. The past of 
Nicholas Jordan, after all -- as he realizes while sitting uneasily in that 
concert at Versailles -- was in many ways a lost and even a destructive one in 
his half-century devotion to Rose. "He had put mother, father, students, 
lovers, wife and child second to her in his affections. . . . He . . . had cut 
himself off from human intercourse in order to become one with her." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the novel, of course, lies in Nicholas Jordan's effort to make a 
meaningful peace with the long trail of failure and success that now lies 
behind him -- and with the death he knows to be approaching. But what raises 
this story toweringly above the commonplace is the unmatchable character of the 
wonderful Rose, who offers counsel, perception, wisdom, and corrective advice 
throughout, and whose unflappable and enchanting voice will be a high treasure 
for lovers both of music and of words. Nicholas will die, while Rose will go 
on, played by others, and yet even so she can still give comfort for what has 
been, and can advise Nicholas to "Be grateful for the adventure and say 
goodbye." "I am uniqueness and beauty personified in an age of uniformity and 
ugliness," she reminds him, and, in words that can thrill as meaningfully and 
deeply as any others in this unpretentiously profound and quietly daring 
masterpiece of intelligent, thinking fiction: "Close your eyes and let me 
caress you for the last time. Listen to my voice, which resembles the human in 
all its inflexions . . .; clean and piercing in the treble, caressing in the 
tenor, ravishing and golden in the bass."

A STRANGER IN THE HEARTLAND; 
</P>
<P>
BIRD, KANSAS BY TONY PARKER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 368 PP.; 0-394-55794-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Kaufmann, Kaufmann lived for several years in an Iowa town even 
smaller than Bird, Kan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The logic that animates the idea that an outlander could see American culture 
with greater acuity than the inhabitants themselves is the same logic that 
drives those locked in the grim dance called marriage to seek counseling. The 
designated stranger, whether counselor or culture critic, has the advantage of 
fresh eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The America that Robert Frank saw through his viewfinder in the 1950s, for 
example, was so different from the sanitized version made popular during the 
Eisenhower years as to open up a new (photographic) universe. Frank made the 
familiar strange, and the strange seem familiar. Not for nothing did Jack 
Kerouac exclaim of Frank, "The man has eyes!" 
</P>
<P>
Today, things are different. Images of American culture proliferate throughout 
much of the world and have conspired with various other forces to create an 
America that's part myth, part fact. Exactly which part is real and which is 
not confuses everyone, the inhabitants themselves in particular. 
</P>
<P>
So it is that foreigners come to report on some aspect of the United States can 
arrive disadvantaged enough by preconceptions of America that their vision is 
blurred. Which brings us to Tony Parker's "Bird, Kansas." 
</P>
<P>
"Bird, Kansas" is an oral history of a small Midwestern town built from 
extensive interviews. That the book was tape-recorded is too obvious -- Parker 
should have taken more care to hide the seams. It gives everything an air of 
realism to go with rough cuts and raw speech, but do we really want to be 
reminded how ungrammatical most speech is? For safety's sake, the names of the 
town and its residents have been camouflaged. 
</P>
<P>
The book's purpose, says Parker, is to offer "a more realistic impression of 
everyday America than the one conveyed by 'Dallas,' 'Dynasty,' 'The Colbys' and 
'Miami Vice.' " That's not asking much, is it? 
</P>
<P>
Our initial view of Bird is through the windshield of the county sheriff's car. 
He says things such as: "So now this here's Main Street, we usually say just 
Main. Might not be exactly Maple Street, Los Angeles, but we like it well 
enough: Least the prices aren't so high." There's a conspicuous "Mayberry, 
RFD," factor at work here; it's easy to imagine Parker smirking. (Now what was 
that about escaping from TV America?) 
</P>
<P>
"Bird, Kansas" ends with the chapter, "Land of the Free and Home of the Brave." 
It's a flag-waving opportunity, bloated with comments such as the one from a 
guy who thinks that those who don't believe " 'My country right or wrong' . . . 
can't call theirselves real Americans and they shouldn't be allowed to." 
</P>
<P>
And this, from a beautician: "Sure America throws its weight around: Because it 
has a right to." It's patriotism in caricature, and it's an easy target, but 
jingoistic spouting off is not typical of everyday life in a small town. That 
"Bird, Kansas" begins and ends locked in an embrace with stereotype is 
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so what about those legendary small-town values? One of Parker's subjects, 
back for a hometown visit, explains: "Yesterday, I left my purse in Gover's 
(grocery), and when I got home I said to my Pa I should call them. He said, 
'You don't need, they've already called to say they've got it for you safe.' " 
It didn't even have my address here in it, but everyone knew I was Pa's 
daughter so this was where I'd be." 
</P>
<P>
Of course. Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery of types Parker exhibits is rich and representative. There is the 
failed farmer, the high school student living in dread of nuclear holocaust, a 
jailbird, the town bum, a librarian, the grocery store manager, a lawyer, and 
even a black woman who blurts out: "I hate all white people." 
</P>
<P>
Too many of the people Parker talked with spend too much time explaining their 
Americanness -- the kind of thing that any American reader will take for 
granted -- to Parker. Parker also has an annoying habit of using contractions 
in a way I've never heard in this part of the country. (The police chief says, 
"I've three full-time men . . ."?) Maybe it's different in Kansas? 
</P>
<P>
But there are times when "Bird, Kansas" sings. In the case of Lucille Richmond, 
who never quite got her life right, the song is country &amp; Western, sad and 
elemental. Parker catches her looking back: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think maybe I didn't love either of those men enough, you know: 
Maybe that was it. With either of them if they'd asked to marry them, I'd have 
gone with them any place in the world. But it could have been I never made my 
feelings to them sufficiently clear, and they couldn't find the courage to ask 
me in case I turned them down. Sometimes I think that." 
</P>
<P>
A Bird automobile dealer who came up the hard way remembers his unhappy 
childhood, recalls his usually absent father: "I saw him once drunk in the town 
one day: I still have this picture in my mind of him standing there on the 
sidewalk, swaying from one side to the other like this, look at me like he kind 
of recognized me from some place. But he didn't say he did, just went on 
standing and swaying there while I went right on by." 
</P>
<P>
You'd expect a book like "Bird, Kansas" to make the small-town/small-mind 
connection (it does, many times) and to put those small-town values on parade, 
but maybe you wouldn't anticipate occasional self-conscious play with 
stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
In a chapter devoted to stay-at-home wives, for example, a woman called Irene 
Finney tells Parker of a day she was in the town's grocery store with several 
other housewives "all getting our provisions for the week. And I suddenly 
thought, 'Oh my God, we're just like those Stepford wives.' Only not as good 
looking. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I mean what do we do all day? We look after our homes and our families, 
two mornings a week we're all girls together at Dorothy's, we join our 
sororities, we bake cakes and make cookies, we have our charity activities, at 
weekends we go out to the Reservoir. But what do we do? We follow a pattern, we 
do what everyone else does. And that's our life." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't that what most of us do, follow a pattern? A book such as "Bird, 
Kansas," which on the one hand has taken vows to present the typical, but on 
the other hand would like to present something more scintillating than, say, 
the excitement of a CPA's day or what, exactly, a Sheetrock specialist does 
each minute, is caught in a bind. 
</P>
<P>
And the subjects can't help. After all, they have just met the interviewer, 
Parker, and they'd like to say something to impress him, and to distinguish 
themselves from the masses. That Parker is British only complicates things: 
Many Birdites reveal a kind of cultural insecurity in the face of his queries. 
This will no doubt comfort the Europeans at whom this book appears to be aimed. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Parker isn't a good interviewer -- what appears in "Bird, Kansas" 
testifies to his skills. It's just that there's something wrong with the spin 
on his material; he hears America singing, he just doesn't seem to notice all 
singers' flats and sharps. 
</P>
<P>
If "Bird, Kansas" tells us anything, it is that everyday life in a small town 
isn't nearly as reducible as you'd think, that outsiders pretty much never get 
"in," that everyone says that he or she shouldn't complain but almost always 
does, that everyone has his or her own story but that story seems already to 
have been someone else's novel, play, movie, or song.

BLAMING ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Friedman's "From Beirut to Jerusalem" (Book Review, July 16) displays a 
degree of intellectual dishonesty that is appalling to read from a reporter who 
is credited with much expertise in dealing with a subject as complex and 
argumentative as the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
What Friedman fails to make abundantly clear is the PLO's desire to create a 
"state within a state" in Lebanon and to establish international terrorist 
camps throughout that country, and the great indifference of the West to the 
suffering and decimation of the Lebanese Christian population due to PLO-Syrian 
occupation. Friedman tends to gloss over this fact, but when the Israeli army 
advanced north toward Beirut, the Christian and Shiite villages along the way 
greeted the Israeli soldiers with the traditional welcoming custom of bread and 
salt, in scenes reminiscent of American soldiers being joyously greeted in 
Belgium and Holland during the Liberation March in 1944. Maybe Friedman, 
hunkered down in his apartment during the siege of Beirut, was unable to 
witness this, but there is plenty of documentation around to verify it if he 
wanted to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman also writes: "I took Sabra and Chatilla as a blot on Israel and the 
Jewish people." C'mon, Friedman, get real. Those vengeful Falangists who 
marched into the camps following the death of Bashir Gemayel could not have 
charity and forgiveness on their minds after seven years of fratricidal civil 
war. The only blame that can be placed on Israel, or Gen. Sharon, for that 
matter for the massacre (and yes, it was a massacre) is the failure to grasp 
the deep-rooted anger and hatred that the Christians of Lebanon felt toward 
their Muslim neighbors. It may be of interest to note here that Israeli 
attitudes toward the Phalange cooled perceptively after Sabra and Chatilla. 
</P>
<P>
In placing considerable blame on Israeli leaders such as Begin, Sharon, and 
yes, Meir Kahane, and glossing over the excesses of Arafat and the Islamic 
fundamentalists, Friedman's book falls well short of a good, balanced overview 
of why the Middle East is what it is.

Everyone laughed when Fox Broadcasting started a fourth television network. 
Nobody laughed at its first attempts at comedy, however. "Mr. President" made 
"Mr. Belvedere" look like "Mister Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President" was just one of the forgettable Fox flops. Does anyone remember 
"Boys Will Be Boys," "Karen's Song," "Women in Prison," "Down and Out in 
Beverly Hills" or "The New Adventures of Beans Baxter"? You have to have a 
masochistic streak to remember shows like those. 
</P>
<P>
But through trial and error, Fox found a nook. It has attracted a bubbling 
youthful audience with shows such as "Married . . . With Children" and "21 Jump 
Street" and for the new fall season, it will capitalize on that target group. 
</P>
<P>
Fox doesn't have as many stations as the big three networks do, nor reach as 
high a percentage of the viewing nation. By adding Monday night programming to 
its schedule, Fox increases its output to only three nights a week. But the 
demographic desirability of the Fox viewership can't be denied. 
</P>
<P>
On recent Sunday nights, Fox has come in third, not fourth, among the networks, 
beating ABC. One reason is that the lazy established networks continue to treat 
summer as a toxic dump site, programming almost nothing but ratty reruns, 
handing their audience over to whoever wants it. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Fox wants it. A new Fox show, the "Candid Camera" rip-off "Totally 
Hidden Video," earned horrible reviews and threats of a lawsuit from "Candid 
Camera" creator Allen Funt. But it also earned the highest ratings of any Fox 
premiere ever. 
</P>
<P>
Among Fox shows for fall are a few with possibilities. "Alien Nation," 
premiering Monday, Sept. 18, is based on the entertaining semi-hit movie of the 
same name, a fanciful cop saga set in Los Angeles of 1995 (the movie took place 
in 1991). The city is host to an all-new ethnic minority: Newcomers, who 
arrived on a wayward space ship from another planet and are trying now to find 
a place in the melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers love to slurp sour milk right out of the carton. They don't have wavy 
hair so much as wavy heads. 
</P>
<P>
The two main characters are buddy cops -- one human, the other an alien. The 
human is a surly, loutish loud-mouth and the alien a sweet-tempered, sensitive 
soul. Hey, it sounds like Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer of ABC's "PrimeTime 
Live"! 
</P>
<P>
Getting a jump on the new fall season, which officially starts Sept. 17, Fox 
will premiere the sitcom "Open House" on Sunday, Aug. 27. This new show grew 
out of an old one: "Duet," a so-so comedy, now canceled, whose most winning 
character was Linda Phillips, a snide snob played with scintillating sizzle by 
Alison LaPlaca. 
</P>
<P>
To judge from the pilot episode, however, the producers don't realize LaPlaca's 
appeal. They have made this another of those gabby ensemble comedies in which a 
gallery of characters each come forward to get a laugh (or not) and then 
recede. LaPlaca doesn't get enough lines, enough attention or enough closeups. 
</P>
<P>
Brooding youths have been a key ingredient of Fox's success. Young viewers seem 
to love the sullen, self-important mini-cops of "21 Jump Street." So Fox has 
spun off another series from that: "Booker," starring the swarthy and beefy 
Richard Grieco as yet another maverick, renegade flatfoot. 
</P>
<P>
"Booker" premieres Sunday, Sept. 24, displacing "21 Jump Street" which moves to 
Monday nights on Sept. 18. And Fox has more brooding youths waiting in the 
wings. Francis Ford Coppola will produce six episodes of "The Outsiders," based 
on his movie version of an S. E. Hinton novel. This fits right into Fox's 
teens-in-jeans formula. 
</P>
<P>
"Outsiders" is one of the backup shows that Fox has on tap in case other shows 
bomb out. The other backups include "The Simpsons," a daft half-hour animated 
sitcom based on characters that have appeared in little blackouts on Fox's 
"Tracey Ullman Show." 
</P>
<P>
"Ullman" and "It's Garry Shandling's Show," which air on Fox Sunday nights, are 
classy and clever productions. For the most part, though, Fox has found success 
by aiming low. "Married . . . With Children" is the smutty-minded sitcom that 
inspired video vigilante Terry Rakolta's cleanup campaign. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fox, though, only one advertiser pulled only one ad from "Married" 
after all the fuss, and the ratings actually went up. Clearly, Fox Broadcasting 
is not going to go broke overestimating the intelligence of the American 
people. But then, that's not the way the other three networks made their 
fortunes, either.

"Who Killed Vincent Chin?" was a very well done but disturbing documentary. A 
better title for it would have been "Why Vincent Chin Was Killed," as it 
brought out that racial prejudice is still very strong and rampant in our 
society, and was a motivating factor behind the killing. The only question I 
have is: How can someone who robs a bank get a 15-year sentence, while another 
who stalks and savagely beats a person to death with a baseball bat only gets 
three years probation? 
</P>
<P>
No wonder people get frustrated by our criminal justice system, as it seems 
like those who are rich or who have had no prior criminal record can literally 
get away with murder. Thanks goodness for public television, as it seems they 
are about the only ones who are willing to show programs such as "Chin."

Re: Elizabeth Becker's review of Susan Fromberg Schaeffer's "Buffalo Afternoon" 
(Book Review, June 11), Where were Richard Eder, Carolyn See or Charles 
Champlin when we needed them? What does Becker, an expert on the Vietnam War, 
know about the art of fiction writing? Has she ever read Schaeffer's previous 
works, such as "Anya," "Love," or "Madness of a Seduced Woman"? Has she ever 
written a novel? 
</P>
<P>
Becker seemed overly concerned about the author's inaccuracies regarding facts 
of the war and the author's inability to give the right answers to the problems 
the war created. As a fiction wrier, this shouldn't be Schaeffer's 
responsibility. She is an artist painting the landscape the way she sees it. 
She is allowed that freedom. Schaeffer, a fine writer, deserves better.

FICTION IN BRIEF: THE COST OF LIVING BY CHRISTOPHER ZENOWICH (HARPER &amp; ROW: 
$17.95; 267 PP.)

What would happen if an MBA wrote a novel? As "The Cost of Living" opens, Bob 
and Irene are scouring the countryside around Ann Arbor, Mich., in a company 
car -- a Caprice Classic -- looking for an apartment. Bob has just taken a 
highly demanding job as a district inventory coordinator (DIC) with a chain of 
discount drug stores; Irene needs some months to "dull out" before beginning a 
law school stint to which she intends to devote her entire being. They settle 
on a town for the compelling reason that it is the home of Kwik Kake, a snack 
they used to eat in college to satisfy the "munchies." At this point, the 
reader is not sure how seriously to take all this. The number of K's in the 
munchy food seems to indicate a parody of consumerism . . . but it's not clear. 
Expect no definite answers from Christopher Zenowich. It cannot be said, 
however, that this is a bad novel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cost of Living" takes us through the first months of Bob's job. We get 
details we never expect in a novel: the contents of business textbooks, for 
example, such as "Store Layout as a Function of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs." 
Soon Bob begins to travel his district and make out reports, struggling with 
the fact that his recommendations will mean unemployment for store managers who 
underperform. As Bob discovers his genius for marketing, home office takes a 
greater interest in him, and his relationship with Irene becomes more distant. 
</P>
<P>
Bob finds it difficult to explain to Irene what happens during those long days 
on the job for the same reason that novels aren't written about jobs like this. 
When Irene presses Bob for details, he routinely answers: "Oh, you know, the 
same old stuff. It couldn't possibly interest you." The fact is that Zenowich 
manages to make descriptions of the meetings, the petty triumphs, the paper 
work well done, the consumer-tricking strategies, absolutely gripping. It 
brings up all kinds of questions about what novels should do: Why shouldn't 
fiction talk about what many of us do in the daily grind? Bob and Irene are far 
from shallow; they are intelligent young people who are coming to grips with 
the great questions of growing up. Somehow, however, "The Cost of Living" 
remains a well-executed curiosity. Just as perhaps one novel can be written 
about high-energy physics, one can be written about high-level management 
training seminars, but one wouldn't want the style to take over the genre.

Split into two equal and utterly different halves, Judith Ortiz Cofer's novel 
concerns the break in tradition that defines the first generation of a Puerto 
Rican family in New York. The narrator of the novel, Marisol, was born in the 
family's native village, Salud, but was brought to the mainland as a baby. In 
the first half of the novel, she tells the mythic tales of the Puerto Rican 
village where her father and her wild uncle Guzman grew up together. Cofer is a 
poet -- this is her first novel -- and in her descriptions of the small town, 
her eye for detail brings alive the stifling and magical world of village life: 
the seething hostilities carried over decades, the power of wives, the privacy 
that people manage to maintain even in crowded shacks. A pious brand of 
Catholicism puts the priest nominally at the center of village life. But 
spirits are also a serious force to be contended with; cleansing and protecting 
rituals are practiced daily, and the dead are as much a part of the village as 
the living. Mama Cielo, mother of Guzman and Marisol's mother Ramona, receives 
a rocking chair as an inheritance from her mother-in-law, but "not trusting her 
motives even in death, Mama Cielo had always kept the rocker out on the porch."

From childhood on, Guzman is called "the devil's child" because of his 
uncontrollable, wayward habits. Although his mother's favorite, he brings her 
nothing but grief. At 15, he flouts all of Salud's conventions by running off 
to live with La Cabra, a village outcast who is consulted in secret for love 
potions but is openly scorned as the lost woman of the village. Guzman and his 
best friend, Rafael, make plans to escape the village. For poor Puerto Ricans 
who have never traveled beyond the nearby market town, the other place in the 
world is Nueva York, "la tierra de nieve" -- the land of snow. 
</P>
<P>
In the telling of these stories, Marisol is all but absent, surfacing only 
occasionally in the identification of characters as "my uncle" or "my father's 
family." The second half of the novel consists of Marisol's life in El 
Building, a tenement in New Jersey where Rafael has brought his wife and baby. 
Rafael is in the Navy and determined to become Americanized. On his rare visits 
to his family, he speaks only English to his children and rarely reminisces 
about his childhood. Marisol's knowledge of Puerto Rico comes mainly through 
tales told by her mother of her wild brother Guzman, who has not been heard 
from in years but continues to be the main topic in letters from Mama Cielo 
back in Salud. When Guzman suddenly surfaces at El Building, Marisol finally 
confronts a part of her family's past. 
</P>
<P>
Cofer's narrative is a bit jerky, occasionally repeating itself, as if many 
sketches had been strung together. But many of the passages are beautiful, 
particularly the scenes where Guzman wanders Salud at night, taking leave of 
the village he plans to abandon forever. The lasting impression from Cofer's 
novel is the gulf that separates poverty-stricken life on the island and the 
trapped, tenement life on the Mainland. Although all the immigrants say they 
will return to Puerto Rico one day, funerals are the only thing that draw them 
back. For the rest, their desire to return to the village only with all the 
outward signs of success -- a big car, lots of money -- keep them as 
inextricably bound to the life of El Building as they were in the native 
village.

CHINA JOURNAL 1889-1990: AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY FAMILY DURING THE BOXER 
REBELLION WITH THE LETTERS AND DIARIES OF EVA JANE PRICE AND HER FAMILY;

By John Espey, Espey, the son of Presbyterian missionaries to China, was born 
in Shanghai and has written three books of reminiscencesMinor Heresies, Tales 
Out of School and The Other Cityabout his Chinese boyhood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When my mother, an unmarried woman of 22, arrived in Shanghai in 1904, the 
memory of the Boxer Rebellion and its martyrs was still green. During her first 
month of teaching at Miss Jewell's School in the International Settlement, she 
was wakened one night to what she thought was the sound of gunfire, and running 
out into the hall of the dormitory was met by some other teachers, one of whom 
exclaimed, "The Boxers!" A few moments later a servant appeared to reassure 
them, saying that it was only firecrackers in a street procession. Nothing so 
dramatic as this ever happened to me during my boyhood, but those who had been 
under siege and had survived were still looked on with awe, and the (possibly 
inaccurate) number of martyrs -- 242 -- was easy to remember for its symmetry. 
Growing up in Chinese territory, I knew that many Chinese still sympathized 
with the Boxers in their effort to get rid of the foreigners and, being 
somewhat Chinese myself, I understood that feeling, though I had sense enough 
not to express it to my Presbyterian father. 
</P>
<P>
In his foreword to this remarkably full record of one missionary family's 
experience in China, Harrison Salisbury notes that approval of the Boxers still 
survives in China and aptly draws a parallel between the events of the 
rebellion and the essence of Greek tragedy. With the missionary's concern for 
the saving of immortal souls set against pride of a totally different cultural 
inheritance, disaster was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Prices were not quite the typical mission family. They heard the call a 
little late in life, went to Oberlin College, as devout Congregationalists, to 
prepare themselves for carrying out their duty, and arrived finally in an 
inland station. Eva Jane Price wrote lively letters home; her husband, Charlie, 
rather dull, formal ones. With the birth of children they became, like most 
Protestant mission families, doubly vulnerable, torn between carrying out what 
they saw as their divinely appointed duty and their human feeling as loving 
parents. Some of the most moving passages of these letters -- rescued by Eva's 
grandnieces from a wicker basket that had been passed from generation to 
generation -- are Eva's assurances to her family and herself that she and 
Charlie are grateful to God for taking their two young sons to himself so early 
in their lives. Beneath these sincere assurances of faith, one feels the aching 
arms and heart of a loving mother, who now has special reasons to cherish their 
third child, a daughter, remaining with them to the end. 
</P>
<P>
But not everything is tragic here. Indeed, through Eva's eyes we get a vivid, 
often humorous, picture of what it was like to live in a remote mission station 
in China in those years, struggling to learn a tonal language without gender, 
number, or tense. Like most American families in China, the Prices maintained a 
non-Chinese household and style of living. "Home" remained across the ocean, 
and this record is broken by a furlough period in America. By this time, at 
least one reader had so closely identified with the Prices that he felt like 
crying out against their return, knowing how truly reluctant Eva was to go, 
though understanding her sense of duty, and knowing as well what lay ahead for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But return they must, and their final days make engrossing reading, involving 
all the suspense of a popular thriller, with a sympathetic Chinese official 
doing his best to protect them, their efforts to escape to the coast coming 
close to success, only to be. . . . But the record and letters themselves must 
be read to get a full sense of who Eva and Charlie Price were and what they 
believed in and what they meant to China and China to them. And with the book 
read, this reviewer found it sobering to consider that millions of the Earth's 
inhabitants continue to believe in one or another revealed religion as truth 
apart from the culture that fostered it and, like the members of the mission 
movement, are willing to die for it.

This collection of anecdotes and fond reminiscences is ideal for readers who 
regard Paris in the '20s as the apex of 20th-Century literature and glamour. A 
popular bartender, Charters served as de facto confidant to many literary and 
artistic figures -- who drank on a scale that seems staggering by today's 
health-conscious standards. (Even the ones he describes as "moderate drinkers" 
appear to have treated their livers as sparring partners.) 
</P>
<P>
Because he uses so much slang, Charters' ingenuous prose seems terribly dated. 
"The gayest parties" no longer means what it did when the book was first 
published in 1934, and his patronizing attitudes toward women, blacks and 
homosexuals seem hopelessly antiquated, if not offensive. But anyone who 
daydreams of Parisian cafes, c. 1925, can indulge his fantasies with these 
tales of Hemingway, Ford Maddox Ford, Sylvia Beach et al.

By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
Nabokov's second novel, a sardonic tale of adultery and attempted murder, lacks 
the shimmering, multilayered reality and interlingual wordplay of "Ada" and 
"Pale Fire." The three central characters -- an unscrupulous, opportunistic 
young man; his sensual, scheming aunt and her wealthy, expansive husband -- 
suggest rough drafts for the complex personalities who inhabit Nabokov's later 
works. Although more conventional in language and structure than the author's 
acknowledged masterpieces, "King, Queen, Knave" is far more entertaining than 
many contemporary novels and retains the witty charm that led Nabokov to 
describe it as "this bright brute."

<TEXT>
<P>
Edward R. Murrow's dispatches from London at the beginning of World War II 
remain models of concision, 50 years after he delivered them over CBS radio. He 
summarizes the "hard news" of diplomatic crises and parliamentary debates 
clearly, but is at his best reporting the human side of the struggle. He talks 
to people in air-raid shelters during the Blitz, watches firemen battle 
incendiary bombs, praises the unassuming courage of "Cherry Brandy," the Dutch 
prime minister-in-exile and captures the mood of the city in a few pithy 
sentences. Unlike the inane "sound bites" of contemporary network news, the 
ideas in these incisive reports are distilled, rather than diluted. 
</P>
<P>
Also available in the "Witness to War" series, marking the 50th anniversary of 
the outbreak of World War II, is "Orwell: The War Commentaries," edited by W. 
J. West (Schocken: $8.95). During the early '40s, George Orwell wrote a series 
of weekly essays on the conflict "as seen through Eastern eyes" -- for Indian 
announcers to read over the BBC to counter Axis propaganda in British India. 
(Transcriptions of sample broadcasts by the collaborator William Joyce, usually 
referred to as "Lord Haw-Haw," are included in an appendix.) 
</P>
<P>
Longer, drier and more detailed, Orwell's essays lacks the terse immediacy of 
Murrow's reports. But his participation in this duplicitous war of words 
provides an intriguing background to the newspeak disinformation campaigns in 
"1984."

EXTERIORS: LOFTS IN SUBURBIA; 
</P>
<P>
A SANTA MONICA-BASED ARCHITECTURAL FIRM SAW A NEED -- AND FILLED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WEBB, Michael Webb writes on architecture and design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
INNOVATIVE ARCHITECTURE ALWAYS provokes dissent. Leading Parisians hated the 
Eiffel Tower when it was new, and critics panned the first designs for 
Rockefeller Center. So it was no surprise that the neighbors were up in arms 
when two young Australian architects -- Hank Koning and Julie Eizenberg -- 
proposed a pair of stark towers for a picture-perfect street in the Hollywood 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the buildings remain controversial, but a close look reveals 
how ingeniously the Santa Monica-based firm of Koning Eizenberg Architecture 
accommodated special needs on a steep, narrow site. Koning and Eizenberg had 
discovered that there was an unsatisfied demand for what they called "suburban 
lofts" -- flexible open spaces that working couples could use as home-studios 
if they didn't want to live in a commercial zone. Each tower is three 
20-square-foot rooms stacked above a double garage. The small base reduced the 
cost of excavation and allowed the towers to be set well apart and aligned with 
the converging boundaries of the pie-shaped lot, creating a dramatic 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen, bathroom and storage areas of each tower extend to the hillside 
behind. These two-story structures with gently bowed roof lines project out at 
angles that are calculated to give all rooms natural light without having views 
of the neighbors. An architect and interior designer work out of one tower, a 
theater producer and a movie director share the other, and both have put their 
spaces to inventive use. 
</P>
<P>
The street facades are still raw, but within a few years they should be 
submerged in a riot of honeysuckle, passion vines and bougainvillea to the 
height of the steel mesh balconies. In fact, half the houses nearby are white 
stucco cubes, but flowering trees make them as acceptable as the red-tiled 
Spanish cottages. The architects have picked up on other local features. The 
sheer profile of their towers echoes that of a 1920s landmark, a free-standing 
elevator shaft called High Tower, which serves a cluster of hillside homes just 
a block away. The steps that climb steeply from the street to sheltered patios 
at the top of the site recall other pedestrian ways in the neighborhood, such 
as Alta Loma Terrace. Even the deer still come down to feed.

WINE: RARE BUT WELL DONE; 
</P>
<P>
CHARBONOS BY INGLENOOK ARE NEITHER COMMON NOR COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DIVERSITY IS always welcomed by wine lovers seeking to expand their taste 
horizons. After all, they don't want to drink only Chardonnays or Cabernets. 
One interesting wine, especially attractive because it is rare, is Inglenook 
Charbono. It's a red wine with an intriguing bouquet. But what makes it even 
better is that it is available for less than $12 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The rare cuttings of Charbono -- which, researchers speculate, Inglenook 
founder Gustave Niebaum brought from Piedmont in the northern Italian wine 
country in the late 1800s -- occupy 40 acres at Inglenook. That acreage makes 
up about 85% of the total Charbono planting in California. 
</P>
<P>
Inglenook, a Scottish word meaning a warm and cozy corner, was the name Niebaum 
gave to California's first architectural landmark winery in the Napa Valley. 
Niebaum, a wealthy, young Finnish sea captain, ran his winery as tightly as he 
might have run his ship. To create a constant shipshape sense of order, he had 
the aisles between the rows of grapevines swept daily. Magazine and newspaper 
articles, even books, were written about Niebaum's unusual management style. 
</P>
<P>
Not much seemed to fluster Niebaum. In fact, the late John Daniel Jr., 
Niebaum's grandnephew, once told me a story about his great-uncle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1880s, a visitor turned into the grand driveway to the winery in his 
horse-drawn, two-wheeled gig. The visitor asked Niebaum, who happened to be 
walking by on an inspection tour, "What's going on here? A winery?" 
</P>
<P>
Niebaum nodded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see it." 
</P>
<P>
So Niebaum climbed aboard and gave the stranger a tour. 
</P>
<P>
When the tour was over, the visitor handed Niebaum a dollar tip and, with a 
sweep of his hand, indicated the apparent expanse of the winery. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's doing all this?" the tourist asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A foreigner called Niebaum," the host responded calmly. Niebaum pocketed the 
dollar and waved the stranger on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Inglenook opened (and reopened in 1933 after the repeal of 
Prohibition), it has been considered an outstanding Napa Valley winery, 
dedicated to the finest wine-making procedures. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Jamie Daniel Morningstar, a granddaughter of Daniel and 
Inglenook's resident chef, toured the country promoting Inglenook Charbono. Six 
vintages -- 1984, 1983, 1981, 1980, 1979 and 1977 -- were featured at the 
seven-course dinners she presented. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wine that works with food. It likes bold flavors," she said. Indeed, 
the wine stands up to strong flavors, with rare harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The '84, '83 and '81 are still available and at modest prices. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Charbono, with a silky finesse, costs about $11.50. The 1984 has a 
youthful liveliness and vim that suggests that it can use cellar aging. But the 
softer, leaner 1983 is of an earthy, intriguing balance. It is drinkable now. 
Both are about $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
At Inglenook, visitors can view Niebaum's tasting room, which was fashioned 
after a captain's shipboard compartment, and maybe even catch a glimpse of 
Jamie Morningstar. But you won't have to tip her if she shows you around.

LOOKS: SAFETY FIRST;

PUBLIC OPINION IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON COSMETICS TESTING

For those concerned that their beauty products may be causing unnecessary pain 
and suffering to animals used in product safety tests, there is good news. In 
response to pressure from consumers and animal-rights groups, increasing 
numbers of makeup and fragrance manufacturers are using alternative test 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, Revlon Inc. and Avon Products have become the first 
major cosmetics corporations in the nation to stop using animals in tests. 
Revlon also announced that it will no longer deal with suppliers who test on 
animals, a commitment Avon has not yet made. 
</P>
<P>
Cruelty-free products, as they are often called, were once distributed only by 
mail-order, health food stores and a few drug stores, but with the 
announcements by these major corporations, the products are now widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"People take this issue very seriously. We have received a number of letters 
from consumers who use Giorgio products but wanted confirmation in writing that 
we don't test on animals, and we were able to do that," says Jacqueline Cohen, 
vice president of corporate communications for Giorgio, a division of Avon in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Bills limiting the use of animals for cosmetics and household products testing 
are pending in Congress and in several state legislatures. U.S. Rep. Barbara 
Boxer (D-Greenbrae) recently introduced legislation that would require the 
government to investigate alternatives and encourage manufacturers to replace 
any outdated testing methods used involving animals. 
</P>
<P>
In California, a bill that would ban the Draize Eye Irritancy Test was recently 
defeated. The 44-year-old test requires placing substances used in products 
such as mascara and eyeliner into the eyes of rabbits, while reactions are 
observed and recorded for up to three weeks. Supporters of the bill claim that 
the test is not only inhumane but also outdated and unreliable. The bill is 
scheduled to be reconsidered in January. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Hazard, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Doris Day Animal 
League, says, "Non-animal safety tests have been developed that are more 
reliable, quicker and more economical than the old methods -- and that's the 
message we are trying to get across to legislators." Some firms, including 
Avon, have switched to Eytex, an in vitro test using synthetic proteins to 
duplicate those in the human corneas. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FDA doesn't require any form of safety testing for cosmetics, a 
product that is not tested must say so on the label. "The animal testing is 
only done to protect companies from liability lawsuits," says Beverly McGrath, 
a member of the board of directors of the Ventura County Humane Society and the 
originator, along with Dorothy Done, of the California bill . But Elaine Kite, 
of the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrance Assn., an industry organization, 
disagrees: "All CTFA members want to protect consumers. They want animal 
testing to be available because certain tests simply cannot be replaced at this 
time." Rachel Perry, a Chatsworth cosmetics manufacturer who has sold 
non-animal-tested products for more than a decade, views the decisions by 
Revlon and Avon as significant. "It's about time the big companies joined us. 
Every single day, the letters pour in from people who want cruelty-free 
products. Public opinion is finally having an impact." 
</P>

League, 111 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Suite 200, Washington D.C. 20001.

FRESH CHEESES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOME KINDS OF cheese get better as they get older, hitting their peak after 
they've been aged for a few years. Other cheeses, however, are at their best 
when they're made, then begin to wane almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Mozzarella falls into the latter category. So does rich-tasting ricotta. 
Mascarpone, the soft, creamy and slightly tangy Italian version of cream 
cheese, is another cheese that is never better than in the first moments of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
At the grocery store, your chances of getting freshly made cheeses are pretty 
slim. But that doesn't mean you have to settle for old cheese. The Mozzarella 
Co., a Texas outfit, carefully packs its cheeses into Styrofoam coolers the day 
they are made, adds an icepack and ships them by overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
Postage is expensive (2 to 4 pounds, for example, is $15) -- you'd have to need 
a lot of cheese to make ordering it worth your while. Still, if you were having 
a party and planning on serving an appetizer of mozzarella with tomatoes and 
basil, or a simple mascarpone dip, or you need a lot of ricotta for a 
cheesecake or lasagna, this cheese would surely be a hit. The mozzarella is 
tangy and soft ($7.50 a pound), the ricotta ($3) is absolutely fresh and 
delightful, and the mascarpone ($7.50) is addictive. The company also makes a 
wide range of other cheeses, including a fromage blanc made from cow's ($4) or 
goat's ($9.50) milk, various goat cheeses and caciotta ($7), a semi-soft, 
mellow wheel cheese. As an introduction, try the Classic Italian Sampler -- two 
pounds of mozarella, and a pound each of ricotta and mascarpone -- for $42.50 
(includes shipping). The company ships Monday through Thursday for delivery the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
 For a product list of fresh cheeses, write to The Mozzarella Co., 2944 Elm 
St., Dallas, Tex. 75226; or telephone (214) 741-4072.

G'DAY AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an Australian, "G'bye California, G'day Australia" (by Sean Mitchell, June 
25) made me painfully aware of a few of the things I love and miss about 
Australia: fresh air, intense colors, unurbanized beaches, the slower, 
easy-going pace and the unique spirit of the land. 
</P>
<P>
However, I also love the United States, and California in particular, for some 
of the very things that Australia seems to have less of -- energy, 
entrepreneurial vision and tumultuous variety. Here is a country that seems to 
encompass everything. After about four and a half years here, it seems 
pointless to try to decide which is the better country to live in. Like any 
place, each country lacks something simply by having something different to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the important aspect of living outside Australia is trying to transcend 
the petty side of nationalism and patriotism and opening up to the subtleties 
of different cultures.

MARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Selling Mars," by Kathryn Phillips (June 25): Louis Friedman's 
response to the argument that the moon, not Mars, should be the next goal of 
our manned space program -- that the moon "bores the public" -- points out the 
inherent risk of his focusing solely on a trip to Mars. What's to keep the same 
public boredom from settling over a Mars mission? Witness the Apollo era: 
Despite the fact that it included some of the most dramatic moments in the 
history of mankind, it faded to an obscure close after the initial goal -- 
traveling to the moon -- had been met and the public's attention moved on to 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
Were it not for the space race, Apollo could have been structured as a series 
of challenges that linked together to form an ongoing plan for the future. Each 
element could have left behind an infrastructure of launch vehicles, orbital 
platforms, industrial facilities and scientific outposts that could remain 
useful and continue to grow once the symbolic "goal" had been met. 
</P>
<P>
We shouldn't repeat the same mistake. Let's go to Mars, but let's make sure we 
leave something behind for when we return.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the article on immigration to Australia the persons interviewed did not 
represent all major Australian cities and states, so I can understand the 
writer's omission of Tasmania as a place where Americans have found a new home. 
However, the failure to include Tasmania, probably the most beautiful and 
geographically varied of Australia's states, on the map of the country is 
inexcusable.

'GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE IN MOVIES IS DOING MAJOR DAMAGE...' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheila Benson's July 23 article is right in saying that popular movies this 
summer are bloodier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The gratuitous violence in movies is doing major damage, because it is surely 
related to the high rates of murder and other acts of violence in America, as 
almost every psychological study on the subject now indicates.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The graphically violent movie "Batman" instilled in me a sense of evil. I was 
depressed, not by its content so much as that fact that this hugely popular 
movie has become such a symbol for both adults and youths. 
</P>
<P>
Why aren't we making T-shirts, key chains, etc., that praise the virtues of the 
movie "Field of Dreams" instead? 
</P>
<P>
Do yourself and your family a favor -- go see "Field of Dreams." And buy your 
kids a Superman comic book.

FIXER-UPPER ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning "Fixer-Upper Art," by Suzanne Muchnic, July 23: article 
</P>
<P>
The fact that many modern art works are falling apart gives new meaning to the 
"Temporary Contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
In the real world, when something falls apart, you go get your money back from 
the maker. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that conservator Sharon Blank is also used to fixing Barbie dolls 
and Tupperware. Caveat emptor.

Benson's article seems to underestimate the film audience. I don't see any

acceptable norm.

Try comparing the carnage in the 1967 James Bond film "You Only Live Twice" 
(shown on television here last Sunday) to the latest film; "License to Kill" 
doesn't even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two years ago the Bond movie included two people eaten alive by piranha, 
myriad stabbings, shootings and poisonings, a pitched battle with a body count 
in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Protest all you like against the current upswing in movie violence (like Sheila 
Benson in her July 23 article, I too found the Joker's art-museum rampage in 
"Batman" highly objectionable), but leave "Licence to Kill" out of it; as these 
things go, it's kids stuff.

JAPANESE SCREENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE JAPANESE HOUSE has few walls in the Western sense of the word. Of the four 
sides that enclose most rooms, usually only one wall is stationary, and, as far 
as possible, all space dividers are movable. The fourth wall is generally open 
to a garden or filled with panels of wooden frames covered with translucent 
paper, called shoji. In the past this word described all types of screens, 
literally meaning "things which separate, cover, determine the limit of a 
certain place, or screen the view." 
</P>
<P>
There were two main types: sliding fusuma screens and portable folding byobu 
screens. In English, both are called "screens," and there is some confusion. 
Folding screens served both functional and decorative purposes. They were used 
to divide a room or to provide suitable decoration for a special event, and 
they were used outdoors to create an enclosed space during festive occasions. 
They were usually composed of six panels and were often paired. Two-, four-, 
eight- and 10-panel screens were also made but were less common. Predominant 
themes were taken from nature: Brilliantly colored flowers and birds are 
common, often painted on a gold background. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of folding screens dates back to the 8th Century. Inspiration 
came from China, but it was not long before the Japanese overtook their 
teachers. Folding screens with lavish paintings became an essential part of 
almost every Japanese house. These were set off to great advantage, since the 
usual Japanese room is empty of furniture: no curtains, no hangings, decorative 
objects limited to one or two pieces. Natural wood, pale straw and reed tatami 
mats provide a neutral background against which a single colorful folding 
screen stands out dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of the durability of paper screens lies in the strength of handmade 
papers composed of vegetable fibers. Several layers of such paper are stretched 
over the panels of a light, wooden framework. The actual painting surface is 
pasted on at the very end of the process; the artist did not usually paint 
directly on the screen. Instead, he or she used separate sheets of paper, which 
were painted on the floor. Later the sheets were attached to the screen by a 
professional mounter. 
</P>
<P>
Even today the city of Kyoto has miles of painted walls, sliding doors and 
folding screens from the Momoyama (1573-1614) and Edo (1615-1867) periods. 
Prices for folding screens available in the United States can be high. Recently 
a pair of 16th-Century screens by Unkoku Togan were sold at auction for 
$430,000. Nevertheless, striking examples can be found for a few thousand 
dollars. 
</P>

Japanese Antiques in Hancock Park; McMullen's Japanese Antiques in Los Angeles;

GETTING THE WORD

<TEXT>
<P>
BACK IN THE 1950s, when Bishop Fulton J. Sheen was beating the pants off TV 
comedian Milton Berle in the TV ratings wars, Berle complained that it wasn't a 
fair contest because Sheen had better writers: "Matthew, Mark, Luke and John." 
Nowadays, Berle wouldn't have that excuse -- not if he had Wordworker, the 
Accelerated New Testament, in his personal computer. Wordworker isn't just the 
New Testament on a floppy disk. It's a screaming data base, which is to say 
it's so fast that the program practically jumps out of the screen at you. The 
word window gives a list of 6,063 different words, arranged alphabetically with 
their frequency of occurrence. God, it turns out, occurs 1,354 times, father 
352, Satan 36, Caesar 21 and Gethsemane twice. 
</P>
<P>
Searches are instantaneous. And the text with accompanying chapter and verse 
appears in a window on the right of the screen while the list of search words 
appears on the left. It's possible to search for individual words, lists of 
words or words in a sequence ("Verily, I say unto you," for instance, appears 
102 times.) 
</P>
<P>
When you find the desired chapter and verse, you can export the pertinent

For additional commentary, Wordworker also cross-references the usage of each

<P>
There's something intriguing (though still a bit shocking) about having the 
Bible on a data base. Out of curiosity, you find yourself looking up every 
reference to wine, blasphemy or adultery. Or comparing Matthew's account of the 
birth of Christ to that of Luke. Men of the cloth have long known that even the 
devil can quote Scripture to his purpose. Now with Wordworker, so can anyone 
with a personal computer.

A TRIP TO THE zoo is a favorite outing, but weekends often bring capacity 
crowds. Parents who have elbowed their way in for a glimpse of the chimps once 
too often will probably like to know that there are several Southern California 
colleges where animals are regularly on view -- usually without the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Because Moorpark College in Moorpark offers courses for would-be zookeepers and 
animal trainers, the college keeps more than 350 exotic animals on campus. 
Although the stalls are not open to the public, people are welcome to observe 
the animals from a walk that encircles the compound. Animals in residence 
include tigers, lions, wolves, coyotes, water buffalo and ocelots. There is 
also a petting zoo with goats, sheep, rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as a 
weekly animal show at the wildlife theater. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona maintains barns that house sheep, pigs and cattle, as well as 
the stables of its renowned Kellogg Arabian horses -- all of which can be 
visited. During the school year there is also a monthly horse show at the 
state-of-the-art Arabian Horse Center, a tradition that dates back 63 years to 
founder and breakfast cereal magnate W. K. Kellogg. The show includes jumping, 
vaulting (gymnastics on horseback), trick horses and costumed riders. 
</P>
<P>
Time was when most youngsters either lived on a farm or knew someone who did. 
Today's urban and suburban kids can get a idea of agricultural life from a 
visit to the Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills. This working farm is home 
to chickens, horses, sheep, pigs and cattle. Because these are farm animals, 
not pets, children are able to observe but not touch the animals. The walking 
tour of the farm lasts about 2 hours (no strollers; backpacks OK). The Pierce 
College Farm is also the site of an annual rodeo each May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College Exotic Animal Compound in Moorpark: Weekly animal show on 
Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is $2 adults, $1 for children. The petting zoo is 
open from 10 a.m to 2:30 p.m. daily; admission 50 cents. No reservations 
needed, but larger groups can make arrangements for special shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona: The barns and stables are open from 8 a.m. to 4 
p.m. daily; no charge. Families can tour the barns unescorted; larger groups 
must make an appointment for a guided tour. Horse shows are held October to 
June on the first Sunday of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills: Public tours each at 10 a.m. on 
Saturday; tours are 50 cents per person. Reservations required. No tours in 
August. School groups can tour Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. during the 
school year.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS hardly as well known for its wine-making as are the more 
high-profile grape-producing portions of the state. But as Vance Corum, 
formerly direct marketing specialist for the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, says, "Many people continue to think a wine is not good until the 
media tells them so. What makes a wine good are your taste buds, and what is 
good wine to you may well be made by a winery that isn't able to get visible. 
There are wineries in Central and Southern California that are focused on 
making wine, not on publicity campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Whether your quest is for wine in good taste, wine that tastes good, both if 
possible or just a pleasant afternoon in the country, Southern California 
wineries offer all of the above with a minimum of travel. 
</P>
<P>
The scenic Temecula Valley is both a viticulturist's paradise and a mecca for 
wine shoppers. Located between Los Angeles and San Diego, the 11 wineries of 
Temecula offer tasting, touring, shopping and picnicking. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested wineries to visit in the Temecula area include The Callaway Vineyard 
and Winery, which has tours on the hour, 25-minute sit-down tastings and offers 
dinner with its wine maker four times a year. Baily Vineyard and Winery invites 
you to picnic in their hillside grape arbor after an informal tour of the 
facility. Cilurzo Vineyard and Winery offers tours, tasting and the use of 
their lakeside barbecue area. The Maurice Carrie Winery has a children's 
playground as an extra-added attraction. At John Culbertson Winery, visitors 
will find a bistro featuring California cuisine and a champagne bar. 
</P>
<P>
Champagne lovers are also welcome at Maison Deutz, where the bubbly is their 
only product. Located in Arroyo Grande on the way to San Luis Obispo, this 
American offspring of the famous French parent company is worth a trip up the 
central coast and offers champagne and hors d'oeuvres from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
daily. Tours are given by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of wineries to visit elsewhere in Southern California 
including Ferrara Winery, with self-guided tours, and Thomas Jaeger Winery, 
both in Escondido. Bernardo Winery in San Diego also has several shops 
including a goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Ahern Winery in San Fernando is open for tours and tasting weekends by 
appointment only. San Antonio Winery in Los Angeles offers tours, tasting, a 
restaurant and entertainment. Hank Donatoni, the proprietor of Donatoni Winery 
in Inglewood, is a commercial airline pilot-wine maker. He requests that 
visitors phone ahead to make reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Leeward Winery in Ventura is open daily for free sipping and informal guided 
tours. Santa Barbara Winery in Santa Barbara offers guided tours, and crackers 
are served at tastings.

The Denver Symphony Orchestra ended its 1988-89 season on a low note. Financial 
problems forced the Symphony Assn. Orchestra Board to cancel the final two 
months, and it was felt that the upcoming season would be wiped out altogether. 
But thanks to a recent survival plan that includes concessions from creditors 
to write off $3.2 million of the symphony's $4-million debt, cutting the season 
by half and reducing the musicians' salaries, the orchestra is back in 
business. "Although we regret the need to shorten the season, we feel this is 
the financially prudent way to proceed," said John Low, board chairman. Still, 
there are other obstacles. City Council members have said they would oppose any 
debt forgiveness on the $700,000 owed to the city for back rent for Boettcher 
Hall. Cited as reasons for the symphony's problems are Denver's 10% seat tax, a 
too frequent turnover in management and a cash flow of $600,000 a month 
required to run the symphony.

 -- Not to be outdone by those moms who make enough food to feed the entire 
neighborhood, the residents of Seymour, Wis., threw a 5,520-pound hamburger 
patty on the grill and satisfied the appetites of about 10,000 people in hopes 
of gaining glory in the Guinness Book of World Records. It was no job for your 
average back yard barbecue chef; about 50 cooks fried up the giant burger on a 
specially designed grill 21 feet in diameter as a tribute to Charles (Hamburger 
Charlie) Nagreen, who -- according to local legend -- mashed a meatball and 
made the world's first hamburger in 1885. According to Guinness, the burger of 
record weighed 5,005 pounds, 13.8 ounces and was cooked in South Africa.

 -- Twins Anna Marie and Mary Beth Heinz of Kansas City, Mo., were set to have 
their bone marrow transplants for a rare blood disease. But when the 
5-year-olds' insurance company went bankrupt, hope turned to despair. The 
University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha canceled the operations and said 
it would cost $130,000 for each transplant. A state insurance association 
offered to provide $100,000 for each child. Consequently, their father, Dan, 
has been seeking to raise at least $60,000 for the operations. To compound the 
family's ordeal, Dan lost his job as a meat cutter and has been working two 
jobs, delivering newspapers and hauling trash, to pay the insurance premiums. 
"Basically, he's been working 16-hour days for five years," said Andy 
Willoughby, the girls' uncle. "In all that time, I don't think he's taken more 
than five days off." A fund set up by radio station KCNW in Kansas City has 
raised about $23,000 so far. JAMES MARNELL

PORTUGAL FORGETS EMPIRE AND PLAYS CATCH-UP WITH MODERN EUROPE

LISBON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisbon, a charming but dilapidated coastal city of seven hills, looks more like 
a teeming Third World metropolis than the modern European capital that it is. 
</P>
<P>
There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, the well-used park 
benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men work on the black-and-white 
tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart through honking, fume-spewing traffic. The 
people look sturdy, and not particularly fashion-minded. 
</P>
<P>
This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on the southwestern fringe of 
Europe, has to go to achieve its goal of catching up with its neighbors. Now an 
overheating economy is further imperiling that ambition. 
</P>
<P>
A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the small country's 
ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992. That's when the 
12-nation European Community, which Portugal joined in 1986, becomes one 
barrier-free marketplace of 320 million consumers. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attention eastward to the 
rest of Europe after hundreds of years of looking across the Atlantic and into 
Africa and India. 
</P>
<P>
The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman and Moorish conquerors, 
perhaps have come to terms with the loss of the globe-circling empire that 
their famous explorers discovered five centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxed mingling of black, 
brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in the curry in Portuguese food, in 
the easy command of English in this Portuguese-speaking country. 
</P>
<P>
After painful recession, austerity and more than 25% inflation in 1983 and 
1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamic economies. Gross domestic 
product has grown 4.5% a year on average for three years, and is projected to 
continue at 3.5%. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6%. 
</P>
<P>
A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debt to $16 billion, 
down from 80.4% of GDP in 1985 to 40.7%. 
</P>
<P>
But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcing unpopular 
measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's center-right Social Democrats, 
who won an unprecedented majority in Parliament in the June, 1987, general 
election, have lost support in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
A poll recently published in O Jornal showed the Social Democrats down to 41% 
nearly halfway through their four-year term from just under 50% in the 
election. The clean-cut, 49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation 
for being abrasive and overly self-confident. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36% from 22.3%, and 
Socialist President Mario Soares, a legendary, consummate politician, has 
become increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the first Portuguese leader 
to survive a full four-year term since the 1974 Revolution of the Carnations, 
which ended 48 years of authoritarian rule, mostly under rightist dictator 
Antonio Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficient and competitive 
economy, a more creative and enterprising society, a freer, more modern 
country, without being perturbed by those who would like Portugal to turn back 
to the past," the prime minister said in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workers, who are 
resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulp processing, fearing 
these will replace traditional olive trees and threaten farm jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March, when local people trying to 
dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed with national guardsmen. 
</P>
<P>
In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of Portuguese Industry, said, 
"Now people tend to criticize the government a lot and the mood is a very 
critical one." 
</P>
<P>
Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo, "I think we 
have a certain situation of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
You hear it on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, "Many people are unhappy 
because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. The cost of living is very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody is negative. 
</P>
<P>
Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, "There are more jobs. 
There is less poverty in particular than in the other days." 
</P>
<P>
Inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 12.3%, more than twice the 
government's 6% target for this year, while the trade balance went into the red 
last year, giving it a $5.9-billion gap. 
</P>
<P>
Strong consumption and investment are to blame. Recent political stability has 
unleashed long pent-up demand. 
</P>
<P>
To cool the economy, the government in April instituted 11 financial measures 
that raised interest rates -- now at nearly 15% -- reduced banks' liquidity and 
restricted the availability of credit, particularly in the booming car-sales 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Although some measures were widely regarded as necessary, they were attacked as 
late and misdirected. They have underscored the government's tendency to 
intervene while simultaneously championing free-market policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, it is the private sector that is suffering," said Luis Campos e Cunha, 
an economics professor at Lisbon's New University. "They should be thinking of 
squeezing public expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequent policy changes 
and voluminous red tape. Taxes are complex and labor laws restrictive. There 
are periodic public sector strikes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Investors 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, foreign investors, seeking a foothold in the Common Market ahead 
of 1992 and attracted by Portugal's low wages, invested $496 million in the 
year ended October, up significantly from $166 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nicholas Racich, administrator of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.'s 
Portuguese operations, "You have to keep plugging away." 
</P>
<P>
But the millions of dollars of EC financial aid that have flowed into Portugal 
have proved a mixed blessing. Although it has enabled much-needed improvements 
to transport and communications to begin, EC demands for Portuguese matching 
funds have worsened the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The government is implementing far-reaching economic reforms, including 
restructuring the capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
The third-tier Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges, not yet fully recovered from 
the stock market crash, are being modernized and combined into a national 
bourse. In late April, the government launched an ambitious privatization 
program with the sale of a 49% stake in Unicer, the state-owned brewer. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to create the confidence, confidence on various levels, not just in 
the market but also in the financial institutions," said Rui Ambrosio Tribolet, 
the Lisbon Stock Exchange's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
But another problem is that Portugal's progress is expected to widen social 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone for Himself' 
</P>
<P>
Said Cavalheira Antunes: "The idea of social solidarity is regressing and the 
idea of everyone for himself is coming out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts. 
</P>
<P>
At about $3,700, its per capita GDP is Europe's lowest. It has the worst 
literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal imports 80% of its energy and, surprisingly, half its food, even 
though one-fifth of the population works in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The country is extremely dependent on tourism. Each year, Portugal's population 
more than doubles as tourists flock in, mostly to the southern Algarve coast. 
</P>
<P>
Other big industries tend to be traditional: textiles, footwear, cork, forestry 
products, fishing, wine and ceramics. Shipbuilding and repair, and construction 
also are important. 
</P>
<P>
The experts say 1992 poses two possible scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
If it's lucky and smart, Portugal could become Europe's California by 
concentrating on exotic produce, high technology, light manufacturing and 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
If it is not, foreigners might buy up Portugal's choice assets, leaving it 
flooded with imports and producing the low-tech, low-profit goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese, who are mostly Catholic, conservative and family minded, have a 
reputation for being resilient in adversity and flexible in the face of change. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Portugal prides itself on successfully absorbing about 700,000 
Portuguese retornados and African immigrants who fled to the country in the 
mid-1970s after Portugal gave up its African colonies of Angola, Mozambique and 
Guinea-Bissau. 
</P>
<P>
Optimistic about the outlook is the industry confederation's Lacerda, who said: 
"I think we are not going to miss the opportunity of 1992."

YOU CAN TEACH A COW NEW TRICKS, SUCH AS HOW TO AVOID POISON PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MALCOLM RITTER, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal researchers have developed an unusual strategy for a serious problem 
among some ranchers: they have taught cows to avoid eating poisonous plants. 
</P>
<P>
Heifers were trained to snub a tasty but toxic plant called the tall larkspur 
while grazing, and they remembered the lesson the next season. 
</P>
<P>
The tall larkspur may kill more than 2,000 cows a year on high-altitude summer 
pastures in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming, said range 
scientist Michael Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
If some remaining obstacles can be overcome, the cow training "is very 
feasible" for ranchers with a persistent larkspur problem, which can kill up to 
10% of a herd, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The approach may also work with other problem plants like locoweed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs, of the federal Agricultural Research Service's Poisonous Plant Research 
Laboratory in Logan, Utah, spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the 
research at the Third International Symposium on Poisonous Plants, which 
concluded Saturday in Logan. 
</P>
<P>
Cows relish the flowering plant, which resembles the garden delphinium, said 
study co-author John D. Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers build fences or spray herbicides to fight the problem, both expensive 
strategies, or they may give up the chance to graze cattle on lush grass and 
other nutritious plants in larkspur-infested pasture, Ralphs said. 
</P>
<P>
The new work is designed to make cattle associate the taste of tall larkspur 
with feeling ill. After eating small, safe doses of larkspur, cattle were made 
to feel nauseous by infusion of a chemical through a tube to their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs said the training made five 1-year-old heifers avoid the plant when 
turned loose in a small rangeland plot. When they returned the year after 
training, the aversion persisted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yielding to Temptation 
</P>
<P>
But when they were allowed to mingle with untrained cattle that ate larkspur, 
the trained cows started eating it too. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently if they observe another animal eating it, they're tempted to try 
it," Olsen said. 'And if they eat it then without any ill consequence, then the 
taste aversion is lost, or at least reduced." 
</P>
<P>
To overcome this peer pressure, an additional procedure was tried with five 
pairs of cattle. One member of each pair was trained, and then the two were 
offered small doses of larkspur. When the trained animal started eating, it got 
another dose of the nausea-inducing chemical. 
</P>
<P>
"They must learn that even though my neighbor does, I must avoid it," Ralphs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The training did not work once animals went to the pasture. But it did take 
hold once cattle returned to the experimental pen. 
</P>
<P>
The animals may have been vulnerable to peer pressure in the field because it 
was their first encounter with the pasture, Ralphs said. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, researchers plan to see if cows already familiar with the pasture 
can be trained to resist the peer pressure there. Another approach may be to 
train young cows and keep them separate from larkspur-eating cattle for a year 
or so until their feeding patterns are set, Ralphs said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists still must find a way to make the training procedure practical for 
ranches, he said. Ranchers might train only cows they were adding to their 
herds. 
</P>
<P>
Jack L. Albright, a cattle behavior expert at Purdue University, said in an 
interview that the overall approach makes sense to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It just needs more work," he said.

For the last 10 years, capuchin monkeys, chosen for their small size and 
ability to perform simple tasks, have been working as helping hands for 
disabled people. But a Boston-based organization that matches monkeys with 
handicapped people is losing its government financing this year and now must 
turn to corporations and individuals for donations to continue the work. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Foster's life changed forever one rainy day 14 years ago while driving 
to an auto parts store. He was traveling no more than 30 m.p.h. when he lost 
control of his car and hit a tree. 
</P>
<P>
His spinal cord was irreparably bruised and Foster woke up in his hospital bed 
a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
After several years in rehabilitation, Foster moved into a one-bedroom 
apartment. He was alone and nearly helpless all day, except for an hour or so 
in the morning and evening when a personal attendant came to bathe and feed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Call Changed His Life 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after watching a television show about the possible use of monkeys to 
aid quadriplegics, Foster made a phone call that changed his life again. 
</P>
<P>
He got in touch with Mary Jo Willard, a former research assistant to 
behaviorist B.F. Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
Willard, now the director of the Boston-based organization Helping Hands: 
Simian Aides for the Disabled, first thought of matching monkeys with the 
handicapped after visiting a quadriplegic in the hospital and discovering how 
many small tasks he was unable to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, Foster, now 32, was made a guinea pig in Willard's fledgling 
program. He was matched with a capuchin monkey named Hellion, who was trained 
on the job and often lived up to her name. After several rocky years, Foster 
and Hellion are now such a team that Foster's mother refers to the monkey as 
her "granddaughter." 
</P>
<P>
"She can work for me, she's a friend and she's good at breaking down the 
barriers between people in wheelchairs and people walking around," Foster says. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, capuchin monkeys, chosen for their small size and ability to 
perform simple tasks, have been placed with 15 quadriplegics around the 
country. The monkeys are bred at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"She's instant help," says Mitch Kaufman, 34, of Portland, Ore., who has a 
6-year-old monkey, Peepers. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, who was injured in a car accident on his 30th birthday, says Peepers 
does most of the tasks he once had to wait hours for attendants to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just let her loose," he says. "And she's sort of like a friend but 
really funny. She's somebody there that wasn't there before. She kind of fills 
up a space." 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to provide more than just technical help for the 
handicapped. The monkeys placed with quadriplegics often become like family, 
allowing quadriplegics to care for someone else instead of always being the 
victims, Willard says. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of their lives is so enriched," says Willard, who financed the 
program herself for the first two years while working a part-time job. "It's 
wonderful to see such severely disabled people get so happy and excited about 
something." 
</P>
<P>
'Helping Hands" also involves foster homes around the country where young 
monkeys live for their first several years to grow accustomed to a home 
environment. They are then returned to Boston for training and placement. More 
than 80 young monkeys are currently with foster families, but the waiting list 
for monkeys numbers in the hundreds, Willard says. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Feller of Silverton, Ore., has taken care of Kris, a nearly 4-year-old 
monkey, for three years. She and her family are preparing to return Kris to 
Boston within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll be real traumatic," Feller says. "They become such a part of 
your life. But we knew it was short term. That's why you raise them, knowing 
they will eventually leave to help quadriplegics. It's like raising guide dogs. 
You have to think in that way or else you mourn and weep when they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Willard's idea, which later became a favorite topic for television talk shows 
and news magazines and even the inspiration for the horror movie 
"Monkeyshines," almost never came to fruition. She was turned down by 38 
agencies over two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was enormously discouraging," Willard says. "People just thought it would 
fail and they would be embarrassed by it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Press Stirred Interest 
</P>
<P>
Willard was about to give up when a reporter for a medical journal spotted a 
paper she had written about her program. The journal ran a story on the program 
and other press coverage followed. Soon, Willard says, the agencies that had 
rejected the idea saw it as more viable. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the difference the monkeys have made in the lives of the severely 
handicapped has been enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Foster remembers well what it was like before Hellion moved into his neat, 
one-bedroom apartment in a complex for the elderly in Watertown, just outside 
Boston. He has no mobility below his upper shoulders and uses a mouth stick to 
operate his motorized wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Hellion feeds Foster snacks left by an attendant and dials a speaker phone for 
him. He also knows how to turn on the television, stereo and VCR. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that if a door shut behind me, I couldn't open it up and I'd be 
stuck there all day," Foster says. "If I dropped my mouth stick, I wouldn't be 
able to move from that spot until my attendant came in at night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program to Lose Funding 
</P>
<P>
The program, which has been financed by the Veterans Administration, loses its 
funding this year. Recently, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced 
legislation that would allow service-connected quadriplegic veterans to receive 
a monkey, much the same way they are now entitled to devices like wheelchairs 
and page-turners from the government. 
</P>
<P>
Willard and program director Judy Zazula hope the program will receive enough 
sponsorship from companies like animal food manufacturer Purina Mills and 
individual donations to continue. At present, the program receives $300,000 in 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Zazula, 33, has worked with Willard from the start of the program and directs 
the training of the monkeys. She works 12-hour days at the Boston training 
center where she spends long hours in a wheelchair simulating tasks for the 
monkeys. Currently, there are 18 monkeys being trained at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Zazula is so devoted to her charges that Hellion, Foster's monkey, was the 
"flower primate" at her wedding last summer.

U.S. COURT DISMISSES LIBEL SUIT AGAINST THE NEW YORKER

Journalists can make up quotes by a public figure as long as they are 
reasonable interpretations of what the speaker actually said, a federal appeals 
court ruled Friday in a libel suit by the former director of the Freud 
Archives. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate a 
suit by Jeffrey Masson, who claimed that writer Janet Malcolm fabricated 
numerous statements she attributed to him in a New Yorker magazine article and 
a book. 
</P>
<P>
The purported quotes, which were not in the transcripts of Malcolm's 
tape-recorded interviews of Masson, included Masson's description of himself as 
an "intellectual gigolo," his statement that after Sigmund Freud, Masson would 
be viewed as "the greatest analyst who ever lived," and a statement that he 
would have turned the Freud house into "a place of sex, women, fun." 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that Masson never said any of those things, they were reasonable 
interpretations of taped statements he actually made, said the court majority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rational Interpretations' 
</P>
<P>
In a libel suit by a public figure, who must prove that harmful statements were 
deliberately or recklessly false, quotations can be fabricated if they are 
"rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks" or "do not alter the 
substantive content of unambiguous remarks," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Alex Kozinski dissented, arguing there was evidence Malcolm deliberately 
doctored quotes to make them more bombastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is a journalist's stock in trade," said Kozinski. "To invoke the right 
to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to 
lie in print." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dozen Quotes 
</P>
<P>
In challenging the integrity of the article, the suit focused on about a dozen 
quotes that Masson said were altered or never uttered. In one instance, he is 
quoted as referring to himself as an "intellectual gigolo," in talking about 
his conversations with Eissler and Anna Freud. 
</P>
<P>
The passage read: "They loved to hear from me what creeps and dolts analysts 
are. I was like an intellectual gigolo -- you get your pleasure from him, but 
you don't take him out in public." 
</P>
<P>
The court noted that the taped interview of this conversation went thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"(Eissler and Anna Freud) felt, in a sense, I (Masson) was a private asset but 
a public liability. They liked me when I was alone in their living room and I 
could talk and chat and tell them the truth about things and they would tell 
me. But that I was, in a sense, much too junior within the hierarchy of 
analysis, for these important training analysts to be caught dead with me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Non-Defamatory Term 
</P>
<P>
The court held that malice could not be inferred from the purported fabrication 
because Malcolm's use of the term "intellectual gigolo" was non-defamatory and 
"a rational interpretation of (these) . . . comments." 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski argued that under the majority ruling a person can be misquoted to 
sound stupid, arrogant, evil or insincere and be denied a legal remedy. 
</P>
<P>
"While courts have a grave responsibility under the First Amendment to 
safeguard freedom of the press, the right to deliberately alter quotations is 
not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press. Neither the authorities on 
which the majority relies nor the applicable First Amendment principles suggest 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski said The New Yorker was widely acknowledged as the flagship 
publication when it comes to truth and accuracy and that to invoke the right to 
distort a conversation in print "debases the journalistic profession as a 
whole." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired From Post 
</P>
<P>
Masson, a Berkeley resident, was fired in 1981 as director of the Freud 
Archives. In 1984, he wrote a book saying Freud, the founder of modern 
psychoanalysis, had abandoned his "seduction theory" -- blaming personality 
disorders on childhood sexual abuse -- in order to advance his career. 
</P>
<P>
Masson's suit against the New Yorker, Malcolm and the publisher of her 1984 
book "In the Freud Archives" contends that Malcolm maliciously distorted his 
views by misquoting him. Friday's ruling upholds a 1987 ruling by U.S. District 
Judge Eugene Lynch that dismissed the suit without a trial.

Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) defended himself Friday against growing allegations 
of House rules violations, saying the charges come from "enraged" Democrats led 
by "an almost irrational" Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, the combative assistant House Republican leader, said on ABC's "Good 
Morning America" that Democrats have vowed revenge since he spurred the ethics 
case that led to the June resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are people who are enraged that I insisted on investigating Jim 
Wright and I think, frankly, they will try to do virtually anything to try to 
prove that you can't stand up to that kind of power and get away with it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander already has filed a complaint against Gingrich with the House ethics 
committee and said Thursday he is preparing to amend the charge to include as 
many as 200 additional rules violations.

'NEVER TURNED AWAY FROM THE FARM'; 
</P>
<P>
HE LEFT LAND BUT STILL CALLS IT HOME 
</P>

SHAWNEE MISSION, Kan. -- At 40, Bill Hoch has been gone from his family's dairy 
farm half of his life, but he says he carries its early lessons with him every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
He believes many of his generation left rural life behind because they were 
profoundly influenced by the global images that reached them through mass 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden we started seeing things from around the nation, around the 
world, even from the moon. For our parents that was the stuff of which 
daydreams were made, not reality -- but for us it could become reality. 
</P>
<P>
"The mid-to-late '60s created an enormous, almost magnetic pull on people like 
myself, pulling us away from small-town, rural life. The attraction was 
political, social, artistic, but it all crested on the wave of the 
communications revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Hoch remembers growing up on the farm near Emporia and delivering milk to small 
towns and country schools that have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at rural life and how it's changed in the last 20 years, it's 
easy to get depressed," he said. "I find it destructive and regrettable that so 
much has disappeared, because beyond the economic impact, the loss has created 
a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of this suburb, Hoch regularly enjoys the concerts, plays and 
sporting events Kansas City offers, "and I'd be reluctant to give that up. I 
enjoy the amenities of a city." He needs a metropolitan market for his 
communications business. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Ellen, visit Emporia frequently. His hometown, 100 miles 
southwest of Kansas City, has grown from 15,000 residents when he lived there 
to about 30,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an enormous sense of stability in knowing my family still lives on 
that same 100 acres we've owned for the better part of a century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoch's pony, Rusty, died only a few years ago at the age of 35 and was lovingly 
buried in his corral near the old family home. The pull of the place, where 
coming home for Christmas is expected, remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be dozens of trucks and cars coming and going every hour to the 
dairy. Now, Mom and Dad go to town once a day, and that's the only dust churned 
up in the driveway. Even town has changed. It used to be 10 miles away. Now 
it's grown so much it's only three or four miles to the outskirts." 
</P>
<P>
Hoch is grateful for the values he gained from spending his first 20 years on 
the farm. He says those years are the foundation upon which he has built his 
urban life. 
</P>
<P>
"I never turned away from the farm, I just physically left. I wrestled with the 
choices. On the one hand there were dependable, stable values and a very 
predictable way of life. On the other . . . the excitement and challenge of the 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"I never intended to stay away. I always thought I would go back. I still think 
that."

ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION IN KASHMIR;

OVERPOPULATION TURNS LAKE INTO SEWER

<P>
The water laps gently against the side of punt-like boats as they glide over 
the shadow-dappled waters. The sunset plays against the trees lining the far 
shore and the mountains rising above, still snowcapped despite the summer's 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Children laugh. Fathers smile as mothers lean back against boat cushions, 
enjoying a respite from the oven that is the Indian plains in summer. 
</P>
<P>
Kashmir and the fabled lakes of its capital, Srinagar, have been a lure for 
centuries. Mogul princes praised the serene waters and majestic mountains here. 
British merchant princes and the generals who built the empire also came. 
Forbidden from owning land by the maharajah, they built houseboats that were 
like floating castles on the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1922 I used to visit my customers in a boat," said Mohammad, a Kashmiri 
resident and a craftsman of delicately painted papier-mache objects. "It was so 
beautiful, so clear. I could see right to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, when Dal Lake was really a lake -- no motorboats, no swimming 
boats, no pollution -- when there was just you and a small boat and privacy, 
people used to bring their friends with a small kitchen boat to serve," 
Mohammad recalled. "The singers would come to sing the praises of the beauty of 
the lake and the gardens, and, oh, the people were just carried away. Their 
heads would sway with the music, and they would draw happily on their hookahs." 
</P>
<P>
It takes the memory and sensitivity of such a master artisan to shake the 
reverie of contemporary visitors to Kashmir's lakes, to remind people that 
today's beauties pale beside those of just a few decades ago, to warn that what 
once was is rapidly disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Dal Lake is vanishing, its shoreline shrinking with the ravages of 
overpopulation and careless abuse of Kashmir's abundant natural beauty. Weeds 
choke its bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"Within living memory, open water in the lake is down from 14 square miles to 
nine square miles," said an expert who has studied Kashmir's lakes. 
</P>
<P>
He said tons of silt flow annually into the lake from denuded hillsides that 
straddle feeder streams. The refuse of 1,400 houseboats attacks the lake's 
ecological balance, but this is only a small villain compared to the 25 million 
gallons of raw sewage that are believed to flow into the waters daily. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961 Srinagar had a population of 285,000. By 1987, it was 850,000. The 
refuse of the trebled numbers is choking the lake that gives them economic 
sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Kashmir and its lakes is a microcosm of what is happening in much 
of the rest of India as a population that is expected to reach 1 billion by the 
year 2000 takes its toll on the finite resources of the country. 
</P>
<P>
India is replete with stories of environmental destruction. Vast forests have 
disappeared within a space of one or two generations. Waters that once were 
pure now are cesspools. Deserts have spread as the grasses and trees that once 
held them in check are cut away. 
</P>
<P>
"In my area of eastern Uttar Pradesh, near the Himalayan foothills, there used 
to be great forests, but the timber mafia is taking it all away," a prominent 
politician said recently. "Nobody can challenge them. Police have old World War 
II rifles. They have modern weapons. Who can challenge them?" 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, villagers or environmentalists band together to try to save a 
forest or a river. Occasionally an honest government official will resist the 
proffered bribes, and often the accompanying threats, to enforce laws 
protecting woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the destruction goes on unchecked. The Kashmirian 
government, worried that the lake that brings in so many tourists may be dying, 
is trying to encourage help from New Delhi and international aid to do 
something about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Answers seem simple. More sewer systems and proper water supplies are needed 
here, as in much of India's burgeoning urban areas. But building sewers and 
laying water lines in congested lanes amid haphazardly constructed buildings 
are either impossible or enormously expensive. Governments wrangle over who 
will foot the bill.

HUD HELPS THE RICH TO TEE OFF AT COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
$27-MILLION LOAN USED IN BUILDING LINKS, CLUBHOUSE AT UPSCALE RETIREMENT 
COMMUNITY IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles builder used a $27-million loan insured by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development to build a golf course and help finance a lavish 
clubhouse for a private, gated retirement community in Oceanside, HUD records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
New homes in the development, called Leisure Village Ocean Hills, are selling 
for as much as $329,000 and feature individual back-yard fountains and hot 
tubs. Residents zip around the 400-acre complex in golf carts and gather at the 
multimillion-dollar clubhouse, where two-story, carved wooden doors lead to an 
auditorium with a parquet dance floor, a banquet kitchen, lapidary shop, 
woodworking shop, Nautilus exercise studio, darkroom, billiard club and 
wood-paneled "Wall Street Room," complete with high-backed leather chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure Village, developed by Leisure Technology Inc. of Los Angeles, was 
approved by HUD in 1981 and dedicated in a 1984 ceremony hosted by Alexander M. 
Haig Jr., who joined Leisure Technology's board of directors in 1983 after he 
stepped down as U. S. secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Have Any Misgivings' 
</P>
<P>
"At the time we did it, we didn't have any misgivings," said Charles J. Wilson, 
manager of HUD's San Diego office. "But, looking back at it in retrospect, it 
probably is elaborate." 
</P>
<P>
The funding for Leisure Village was obtained under Title X, a much-criticized 
loan-insurance program discontinued in June by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. Kemp 
said it was "riddled with abuses," had suffered enormous losses and had failed 
to benefit the needy. The program guaranteed $500 million in loans over the 
past 16 years, and losses so far total $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Because Leisure Village has been financially sound -- "one of the most 
successful (HUD) projects in the country," according to Wilson -- it has caused 
no losses for HUD. But neither has it provided any benefit for the poor. Only a 
few of the duplex homes that went on sale beginning in 1984 at prices starting 
at about $100,000 were within reach of those with moderate incomes. In fact, 
according to a Leisure Technology official, most buyers required no mortgage 
arrangements. They paid cash. 
</P>
<P>
While allegations of influence peddling in HUD deals have been widespread in 
recent months, there was no indication that such was the case with Leisure 
Village. Haig became associated with the company after the $27-million loan was 
approved, and officials say it was the only HUD project the company ever 
arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Title X was established to provide loan guarantees for developers of vacant 
land who, in exchange, were supposed to set aside a percentage of housing units 
for low- and moderate-income families. But HUD officials concede that the 
set-asides were more of a suggestion than a requirement, and Leisure Village is 
a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for Leisure Village began in earnest in 1981, when officials of the firm, 
then based in Newport Beach, decided to exercise their $9-million option to buy 
400 acres in North San Diego County. They wanted to finance the construction of 
a retirement community on the site with the help of a HUD-insured mortgage, 
according to Joseph A. Gallagher III, president of the firm's Southern 
California division. 
</P>
<P>
Unsure of how to proceed, Leisure Technology 
</P>
<P>
officials approached DRG Funding Corp., a mortgage lending firm that was known 
to have expertise in dealing with Title X projects, Gallagher said. DRG 
arranged the $27-million loan with an interest rate of 17.5% at a time when a 
similar loan without HUD insurance would have been made at a 21% interest rate, 
Gallagher said. An additional advantage was that it was a 10-year loan, rather 
than the normal 18-month construction loan, Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Powerful Incentive 
</P>
<P>
For DRG, as well as other lenders, there was a powerful incentive: The federal 
government assumed all the risk in the event that the borrower defaulted. The 
security offered by the federal insurance was to prove critical to DRG in later 
years, as many of the firm's HUD-backed loans -- possibly as much as $500 
million worth -- fell into default in another HUD insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
HUD has since canceled DRG's right to issue HUD-insured mortgages, and a 
federal grand jury is investigating allegations of fraud, theft and money 
laundering involving DRG. HUD officials say privately that Leisure Village may 
have been DRG's most financially sound HUD-related venture. 
</P>
<P>
Documents show that DRG received a "financing fee" of $541,422 for making the 
loan. That figure was in addition to the 17.5% interest it charged. 
</P>
<P>
When Leisure Technology and DRG made their initial proposal to HUD's San Diego 
office in 1980, they planned to build about 1,900 duplex units in an area of 
rolling hills about 7 miles from the coast in Oceanside. Prices were expected 
to range from $80,000 to $125,000, according to HUD documents. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also outline the proposal for the 18-hole golf course, clubhouse 
and other recreational facilities, including a swimming pool and tennis, boccie 
ball and shuffleboard courts. The amenities of the development's Ocean Hills 
Country Club are not open to the public, and are available only to residents of 
the high-security complex. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was the first Title X project in San Diego County, local HUD 
officials were unfamiliar with the specifics of the program and consulted a HUD 
manual containing guidelines for such developments, Wilson, the San Diego 
manager, said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
The handbook reads: "A swimming pool, golf course, clubhouse, tennis court and 
marina are examples of recreation facilities which may be included in a Title X 
land development." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Shot Up 
</P>
<P>
"I remember in my own mind thinking, 'A golf course. Why would the department 
do this?' " Wilson said. But, because the proposal appeared to meet all the 
criteria for Title X insurance, it was approved by the San Diego office and 
forwarded to HUD headquarters in Washington, where it received the final 
go-ahead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the loan, the $27 million was to be used only for grading 
and improving the land and constructing the development's common buildings. 
Leisure Technology was to obtain private financing to construct the homes. 
Wilson said there was little his office could do about the price of the units, 
since there were no specific requirements in the loan agreement about what the 
builder could charge. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-square-foot units, the development's cheapest, were to cost $80,000, 
but quickly shot up to $95,000 before any were sold, Gallagher said. The more 
expensive ones sold for $135,000, and the average price was $115,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company was forced to raise the prices because the previous owner of the 
land defaulted on an agreement to build a $5-million stretch of road needed to 
reach the development, Gallagher said. The cost had to be absorbed by Leisure 
Technology, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the following year, prices rose an additional 10% to 15%, he said, and the 
size of the houses was increased to meet consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
"In all our discussions at the time (of the loan application), low income was 
never a consideration," Gallagher said, adding that the company considered the 
$95,000 units "affordable." 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem an inappropriate use of federal insurance," he said. "It made 
HUD a lot of money (in insurance premiums). . . . I know that some developments 
didn't work, but that seemed to be more because they were in the wrong 
location. I don't think the concept was flawed, but people didn't do what they 
were supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economically Sound Move 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said the HUD loan did not finance all of the complex's considerable 
amenities and that Leisure Technology spent about $1.4 million on improvements 
for the 27,000-square-foot clubhouse after using about $1.6 million from the 
HUD-insured loan. Also, he said, the company paid for construction of the back 
nine holes of the 18-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the golf course turned out to be an economically sound move, he 
said, because it provided the company with an inexpensive on-site area in which 
it could dispose of tons of rock excavated at the housing sites. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure Technology paid off the loan in January, so HUD is no longer involved 
in the project, according to John Kilduff, the firm's executive vice president 
and chief financial officer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure Technology, a developer of retirement communities in New Jersey, New 
York, Florida, Illinois and California, has grown rapidly over the past decade 
and two months ago announced it had reached a $1-billion agreement to build 
retirement communities with a Japanese firm. 
</P>
<P>
At the Oceanside complex, the company has moved away from duplexes and is now 
building detached, single-family homes that are sold to upper-middle-income 
buyers, many of them from the Los Angeles area who have developed substantial 
equity in their homes, Kilduff said. 
</P>
<P>
The "San Remo," described as a "private villa" in the development's Village of 
Hydra, is the top-of-the-line model and sells for $329,990. It features three 
bedrooms, a master bath suite, two full guest baths, a powder room, "a 
magnificent oversized living room with walk-in wet bar" and a two-car garage, 
according to a sales brochure. 
</P>
<P>
The full range of facilities of the Ocean Hills Country Club comes with the 
package, the brochure says. And, it notes, "Prices Are Subject to Change 
Without Notice."

Instructor Melanie Dean stood in a UC San Diego laboratory before more than 20 
giddy, bright-eyed students, trying to illustrate the basics of geology: 
namely, how to identify minerals. Then she showed them her key instructional 
tool -- an object that would demonstrate, easily and quickly, the makeup of a 
rock or gem. Their eyes never left the object. 
</P>
<P>
How captivating a chocolate-chip cookie can be. 
</P>
<P>
"Notice how this ties in with your cupcake sediments," Dean, a vivacious 
educator, told the students as they lined up to get the equipment -- including 
two cookies each -- for their minerals experiment. "There are more samples than 
you could ever test. Have fun." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turning the Tables 
</P>
<P>
Dean was teaching "chocolate-chip geology" to an unusual audience -- San Diego 
elementary school teachers, who were more than willing to spend a summer day 
this week on the other side of the desk. 
</P>
<P>
The "students" are participants in UCSD's Science Teacher Institute, a 
pioneering academic effort that is giving 100 elementary school teachers a 
science background and lessons on how to pass on the knowledge to their 
students and fellow educators. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, funded by almost $1 million from the National Science 
Foundation, actually is a three-year science course. Participating teachers 
from throughout San Diego County last summer studied life sciences, with an 
emphasis on nutrition. This summer they are studying the natural sciences, 
including astronomy, geology, meteorology and oceanography, with an emphasis on 
ecology. Next year, the physical sciences, with emphasis on technology, will be 
examined. Eight Saturday seminars during each school year cap off the program. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher-students each morning attend graduate-level courses, taught by UCSD 
science professors. Three afternoons a week, they learn how to convey that 
knowledge in a way that elementary schoolchildren can understand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Booming Business 
</P>
<P>
Teaching teachers how to better teach science is a booming business in San 
Diego. At San Diego State University, 117 teachers from grades four through 
eight from around the nation have almost completed a three-week training 
session in physics. 
</P>
<P>
The program, dubbed "Operation Physics," trains 
</P>
<P>
teams of three members, usually an elementary school teacher, high school 
physics teacher and college professor or administrator from the same area, to 
serve as "workshop leaders" in their home cities and states. Last summer's 
class of 108 has given science-teaching workshops to 12,000 teachers 
nationwide, said Fred Goldberg, a professor of natural science and physics at 
SDSU and a co-director of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"With Operation Physics, we train the trainers of the teachers," Goldberg said. 
"A lot of national reports have indicated a great need to provide appropriate 
training and learning experiences for the teachers of these grades. I think 
there's a recognition among teachers as well as their supervisors that 
something must be done to address that need." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Physics also is funded by the National Science Foundation, which has 
allocated more than $1.6 million for it through 1991. At least four states -- 
Michigan, Indiana, South Carolina and Connecticut -- have already localized the 
project, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Current of Enthusiasm' 
</P>
<P>
"What we have done here is to provide a national-level training program that 
seems to be very successful. There's been a real current of enthusiasm that's 
been developed as a result of this," he said. "The program has got a tremendous 
trickle-down effect." 
</P>
<P>
The NSF is so pleased with the success of Operation Physics and the institute 
at UCSD that it has awarded another $91,000 to establish identical programs at 
five other sites in California. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, in fact, administrators and scientists from UC Berkeley, UC 
Davis, Stanford, Caltech, USC and other schools will meet at UCSD to study the 
Science Teacher Institute and plan projects of their own, said institute 
director Dean. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of such teacher-training programs, of course, is to improve students' 
knowledge of the sciences, administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
It's a timely ambition: In the fall of 1990, the state, which tests young 
students' aptitudes in reading, math and social studies, will begin testing 
third- and fourth-graders in science as well. Because students' test scores 
reflect their teachers' performance in the classroom, elementary school 
educators -- many of whom have been reluctant or afraid to teach science -- 
will be compelled to put more emphasis on science, said Dean. 
</P>
<P>
"When administrators and parents see how bad those (science) scores are, 
they'll flip," said Sharon Taylor, a spokeswoman for USCD. "We're getting in 
gear to answer the need that is going to be evident in a year or so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Translating the Information 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday at UCSD, Dean used a few small tools and beakers to demonstrate 
how minerals can be identified, then showed the teachers how to conduct a 
similar activity with chocolate-chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's giving us a background in science -- a real foundation -- so we can take 
the concepts and simplify it to a level at which our kids can understand it. 
Here, we're the kids. We're doing what (our students) will be doing," said Pam 
Kelly, a third-grade teacher at W.D. Hall Elementary in El Cajon, as she and 
her partner dissected a cookie and examined its contents. Later, the two would 
repeat the process with a crumbled piece of rock. 
</P>
<P>
"What's exciting to me is that we're learning the information and it's bringing 
out our creativity," Kelly continued, munching on the remnants of her 
experiment. "Once you've got an idea in your head, you see all different kinds 
of possibilities for conveying that. Best of all, you find yourself pulling 
away from the book." 
</P>
<P>
An earlier lesson this summer used iced cupcakes to illustrate sediment layers. 
Next week, the class will study the rock layers of the earth's crust by looking 
at peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
In a lab down the hall, other teacher-students used plaster of Paris, paint and 
Styrofoam to demonstrate earthquake waves and faults. Participants have gone 
behind-the-scenes at Sea World and the zoo; next week, they'll take a field 
trip to Mt. Soledad to study rock formations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visual Activities 
</P>
<P>
"These activities are so visual. Kids can relate to things like cookies and 
activities outside the classroom," said Karen Hedrick, who teaches 
second-graders at Bird Rock Elementary in La Jolla. "They make you much more 
motivated to do them with your children." 
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to convey what they've learned not only to their 
students, but to their colleagues as well. Many will teach the information 
during in-service periods; others will serve as their school's science-teaching 
resource. Educators participating in Operation Physics are expected to spend at 
least 72 hours training other instructors in the teaching of physics. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are getting more than a science education and free snacks for 
their participation in the institute, program administrators say. When they 
complete the three-year program, they will have earned 30 units of credit 
toward a master's degree in education, National Science Teachers Assn. 
certification in elementary school science, almost $2,500 in stipends and free 
science textbooks and materials, including dozens of activities to be used in 
the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"When the kid gets turned on in the classroom, the teacher gets turned on. But 
that won't happen unless the teacher is prepared," said Dean. "We're trying to 
provide all the pieces of the puzzle." 
</P>

PARADISE VALLEY NEIGHBORS RAISING A STINK ABOUT JAPANESE CATTLEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the dry, brown hills of Paradise Valley near the Riverside County line, a 
clash of cultures is shaping up between Japanese cattle raisers and their rural 
American neighbors. The thousand or so black cattle in Paradise Valley pens are 
the forerunners of the 100,000 head a year that American First Beef, an 
Escondido-based enterprise owned by Japanese investors, plans to fatten, 
slaughter and ship to Japan. The aim is to capture a chunk of the Japanese beef 
market when import restrictions and heavy tariffs on beef imports are lifted in 
April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
To residents of the isolated valley, the advent of a massive cattle feedlot 
within sight and smell of their homes has caused concern and defensive action. 
Their complaints to elected and regulatory officials have triggered new laws 
aimed at restricting the company's operations, and brought threats of a hefty 
$300,000 fine and other sanctions against the foreign firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggestions on Harassment 
</P>
<P>
A sign posted in the nearby Sunshine Summit country store urges residents to 
continue to fight the interlopers. It offers suggestions on how to legally 
harass the company and evict it from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
One violent incident in the range war has already been recorded: Windows in the 
company's ranch house were shot out. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Paradise Valley residents complaining about the feedlot fear that the 
clustering of thousands of cattle in pens will bring noise, dust and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Winne, general manager of American First Beef, said they are judging by 
American standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who live close to livestock because of the tiny size of their 
island nation, have developed husbandry methods that virtually remove those 
negative effects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 16 or so investors in this 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-American venture are established cattle and hog raisers in Japan. The 
Japanese had no desire to move their lucrative industry to the United States, 
or anywhere else for that matter. But, when the trade barriers come down in 
1991, under terms of a trade agreement between the two nations, Japan's 
home-grown, high-priced beef will run into fierce competition from the cheaper 
imports from Australia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
So Japanese cattlemen are coming to America, where they can mass-produce and 
thus sell prime beef at a fraction of the cost of doing so in their land-poor 
homeland. They bring with them centuries of sanitation techniques and cattle 
management knowledge that permit them to raise cattle in confinement without 
the smells, flies and noise associated with most American feedlots, company 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
American First Beef purchased the 38-acre ranch north of Warner Springs in 1987 
and has since been conducting its compact cattle-feeding with precision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Became Alarmed 
</P>
<P>
The 50 or so residents of Butterfield Oaks, a tree-shaded mobile home park 
about three city blocks from the Japanese venture, were understandably 
concerned as they watched the construction of the cattle feedlot. Spurred by 
rumors that the company was planning to bring in as many as 14,000 head, 
Butterfield Oaks residents and villagers from nearby Sunshine Summit joined to 
oppose the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Winne grew up in the Imperial Valley, where the smells of cattle feedlots are 
familiar. He can understand the neighbors' prejudice against living next to a 
herd of close-packed cattle. But, he said, the Japanese do things differently. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, he invited any doubting residents to the operation -- to 
sniff and snoop and to demonstrate that the Japanese methods can turn a 
malodorous feedlot into a good neighbor. Few have accepted his invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Winne buys cattle from area ranchers, aiming for black (the Japanese like 
black), short-legged (because they have no need to walk for more than a few 
paces), full-bodied (the better to grow beef on) steers and heifers. He places 
them in airy, sun-shaded enclosures surrounded by feed and water 
around-the-clock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pampered Cattle 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, ranch workers trained in "gentling" procedures line up the herd 
and pat and pet them. Pampered cattle produce prime beef, Winne believes. 
Stress can darken the meat, he said, just as excessive exercise can toughen it. 
Gentling, which is little more than petting and soothing, is one of the secrets 
that the Japanese use to produce high-quality beef. It is also the only one 
Winne cares to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd be doing a thing like that," he acknowledged. "But I have 
to admit that it works." 
</P>
<P>
Special feed, meticulous management and the know-how of centuries of Japanese 
cattle-breeding lore have produced a product suitable for the Japanese palate 
in this barren Paradise Valley feedlot. It bests the famous Kobe beef of 
southern Japan and rivals the meat of wagyu cattle, the top prime grade of 
Japanese beef, Winne said. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of the ranch's ability to transplant its Japanese methods to America came 
recently when prime cuts from its Paradise Valley herd fetched $117 a pound on 
the Tokyo restaurant market. The company's goal is to reduce that price to 
about $12 a pound for its American-grown beef. The lower cost, investors 
predict, will cause the demand for beef to mushroom on the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Winne concedes that there has been a clash or two within the company as each 
culture acclimates to the other. There are Japanese, Vietnamese and Mexican 
workers, many of whom do not speak English or any other tongue common to all. 
Winne speaks none of those languages, but he has learned to get his point 
across. 
</P>
<P>
The company will succeed by blending American technology and Japanese 
quality-control techniques, he said. Its problems will occur if there is a lack 
of communication. 
</P>
<P>
He is less adept at bridging the communication gap with the ranch's Paradise 
Valley neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping Close Scrutiny 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by complaints from the neighbors, state and local officials have taken 
a close and critical look at the cattle-feeding operation. Staff from the 
county Air Pollution Control District and the state Regional Water Quality 
Control Board have become frequent visitors to inspect the feedlot and to issue 
citations, warnings and advice. 
</P>
<P>
Water board staffers recommended that a $300,000 fine be imposed on the company 
-- a $10,000-a-day fine for failing to obtain a federal waste-discharge permit 
before starting operations last August. More daily fines will be levied until 
the company conforms, said Ladin Delaney, executive director of the agency. 
American First Beef also faces several pollution control citations for dust 
caused by the movement of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a delegation of Paradise Valley residents complained to the County 
Board of Supervisors that the feedlot was being expanded, despite county 
restrictions. Their representative on the board, John MacDonald, has said that 
perhaps it is time to seek a cease-and-desist order against American First 
Beef, a move that could put the feedlot out of business. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald opposes the feedlot because it has riled his constituents and because 
it appears to have slipped through the cracks of county zoning and land-use 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
He reacted by sponsoring emergency legislation that put a moratorium on any 
increase in the number of cattle now on the feedlot. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance pertains only to beef cattle feedlots, exempting hogs, 
sheep, goats, dairy cattle and other large animal operations. A proposed 
permanent ordinance would cover hog and beef cattle feedlots but would still 
affect only American First Beef. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said he has no quarrel with Winne or his Japanese bosses but contends 
that the Paradise Valley feedlot is in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of open territory in that area along (Highways) 76 and 79, so 
they don't have to put those cows near people," the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not my personal ambition to shut them down," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racial Conflict Denied 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said there are no racial overtones in the controversy, just concern 
about the effect of an uncontrolled feedlot near homes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a matter of Japanese versus Americans," MacDonald said. "That has 
nothing to do with it, as far as I'm concerned. If it had been Joe Blow Farmer 
running that feedlot, we would have acted no differently." 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald concedes that American First Beef purchased its property legally and 
set up its feedlot within the county's existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
But MacDonald argues that the proposed county legislation to govern cattle 
feedlots used to be on the books until 1979, when "it fell through the cracks" 
because there were no feedlots operating in the county. Now that Amercian First 
Beef has started a feedlot, regulations on the size of such operations should 
be reinstituted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winne and American First Beef attorney Michael Pines contend that any 
legislation to restrict or close the feedlot represents a taking of property, 
or what attorneys call inverse condemnation. And that goes double for 
legislation that applies only to American First Beef, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Larkin, a state brands inspector and a frequent visitor to the feedlot, 
where she checks on the condition and ownership of arriving and departing 
cattle, can't understand what all the commotion is about. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more flies in my back yard than they do at their feedlot. And, as many 
times as I've been out there, I've never detected an offensive odor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The American First Beef feedlot is a plus for local cattlemen, Larkin said, 
because it opens up another local market for beef cattle, most of which are 
shipped to Riverside or Los Angeles to market, or to the Imperial Valley for 
fattening, she said. Operating a well-run feedlot "in a place so dry that even 
the jack rabbits have to carry canteens" is quite an achievement, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Compromise 
</P>
<P>
Winne, 42, would like to reach a compromise that would allow American First 
Beef to continue its Paradise Valley feedlot with reasonable limits on the 
number of cattle. Barring that approach, he said, he may run for supervisorial 
office against MacDonald on the next go-around because "agricultural interests 
in this county deserve a voice in government." 
</P>
<P>
John Braly, spokesman for the California Cattlemen's Assn., can only shrug when 
asked why Winne and American First Beef are running into so much opposition in 
San Diego County. Other cattle operations around the state -- in Gonzales, 
Corning, Fresno and elsewhere -- have been acquired by Japanese interests, he 
said, "and the people welcomed them in." 
</P>
<P>
Both state and national cattlemen's groups back the foreign investment from 
Japan "because it helps open up the growing Pacific Rim market," Braly said. He 
knows of no other place in the state where the Japanese have run into such 
local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Regional Water Quality Control Board complaints against American First Beef are 
now the subject of closed-door talks among Winne, company lawyers, water board 
staff and state Asst. Atty. Gen. Jerry Blair. The group is attempting to sort 
out the tangle of directives that have rained down on the feedlot. 
</P>
<P>
The regional agency's chief, Ladin Delaney, said the Japanese firm is facing 
stiff fines because it failed to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination System permit before opening the feedlot a year ago. Winne responds 
that he complied with county requirements when he began the feedlot and was 
assured at that time that no other governmental permits were required. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney remains unconvinced that the firm was ignorant of the law and stressed 
that he is not about to let the company get away with "such a flagrant 
violation" without a sizable penalty. Perhaps, he said, there may be some 
reduction in the $300,000 penalty based on the responsiveness of the cattle 
firm to comply with state and federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no response within the next few weeks, Delaney said, he is prepared 
to turn the matter over to the state attorney general with orders to seek an 
injunction and shut the feedlot down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Water board spokesman David Barker said his agency maintains that American 
First Beef has taken no precautions against discharging waste from its 
property, endangering potable water supplies, including Temecula Creek and Vail 
Lake, which is the water source for fast-growing Rancho California. 
</P>
<P>
Also at risk, according to the water board, are nearby wells, including the one 
serving Butterfield Oaks, which show high readings of nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
Winne disputes the agency's reports, denying that any discharges leave the 
ranch property except for manure that is hauled away and sold to local ranchers 
for fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
As for pollution of the Butterfield Oaks water well, Winne said: "It's a lot 
more likely that their own septic lines right next to the well are the cause. 
Our well is fine." 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be singling us out, trying to force us out of business," Winne 
said of the local regulatory agencies. "That just isn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese investors in American First Beef already have spent $7 million to 
$8 million in their effort to transplant operations to San Diego County, he 
said, "and this is a life-and-death matter for them."

HOT SUMMER DAYS BLOW LIFE INTO THE MAGIC OF BUBBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2-year-old's eyes grew practically as big as the shimmering bubble being 
blown inches from his nose. 
</P>
<P>
As the bubble floated free, the toddler, unable to contain his excitement 
another second, reached out and shattered the gossamer sphere, then danced with 
glee. 
</P>
<P>
"Bubbles are sort of magic," said Mark Dorfman, the bubble blower, who runs 
structured play sessions in Orange County for babies and preschoolers. "It's 
all based on science, but the kids just know they have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
People are forever blowing bubbles, but toy manufacturers say there is a bubble 
season: the long, hot days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Out West, your season is longer. In Minnesota, it's a short season," said 
Myron B. Shure, chairman of the board of Strombecker Corp. of Chicago, which 
makes Tootsie toys, Wonder Bubbles and Mr. Bubble, the biggest line of bubble 
soap and toys in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bubble wands, bubble hoops, bubble trumpets, a "Swiss army bubble knife" ("for 
emergencies," according to Dorfman), bubble snakes, bubble pipes, bubble bears 
(with a wand that pops up when the bear's belly is squeezed, cutting down on 
bubble soap drips), toy lawn mowers that blow bubbles -- all line toy-store 
shelves for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best time of year," said artist Michael Marks, who uses bubbles as an 
art form. He exhibits bubbles and giant balloons for children at museums and 
libraries. The La Habra Children's Museum hopes to host a Marks bubble exhibit, 
a museum official said. 
</P>
<P>
Other bubble exhibits featuring respected scientists and bubble enthusiasts 
have been held at San Francisco's Exploratorium and at the Franklin Institute 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Shure said bubble soap -- sometimes as cheap at 30 cents a bottle -- is the 
biggest-selling toy, if you count bottles instead of dollars. He said his firm 
sells 50 million bottles a year, "and if you figure how many bubbles you get to 
a bottle, we're talking about billions and billions of bubbles." 
</P>
<P>
Why such enduring popularity for an object made of soap and air and so 
transitory that it seldom lasts a minute? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Brief Love Affair' 
</P>
<P>
"Bubbles are one of the few things in life that we are allowed to break," said 
Tom Noddy, known as The Bubble Guy and author of the book "Tom Noddy's Bubble 
Magic." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have a long life. So it's a brief love affair," conceded Luke 
Knowles, sales manager of Small World Toys of Beverly Hills, an importer of 
European toys. "A bubble is born and you enjoy it. It's the anticipation: How 
big will it get, how high will it go? It allows adults to be kids, and it 
allows kids to enjoy being kids." 
</P>
<P>
Marks encourages children to forgo the commercial toys and to invent their own 
bubble wands. A bent coat hanger, the pull tabs from beverage cans or a 
six-pack holder can be "better than anything you can buy in the store." 
</P>
<P>
A simple straw is a great bubble blower, Dorfman said. Or a coat hanger wrapped 
with yarn. Or a string passed through two straws, then tied to form a rectangle 
when the straws are held apart. You can even blow a bubble just using your 
fingers formed into a circle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scientists Fascinated 
</P>
<P>
But bubbles are not just child's play. Scientists have been fascinated by them 
for years, and bubbles pose mathematical questions that still go unanswered, 
Noddy said. 
</P>
<P>
A bubble is born, he explained, because mixing soap and water molecules 
increases the distance between the water molecules, reducing the surface 
tension and allowing the solution to stretch into a film. When air is steadily 
blown into the film, it stretches until the film closes itself off into a 
bubble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Evaporation Enemy 
</P>
<P>
The biggest enemy of soap bubbles is evaporation, which can make the bubble 
wall even thinner, causing it to burst. Consequently, bubbles work best in 
humid weather. "Bubbles are not so great in the desert," Shure said. 
</P>
<P>
Touching anything dry -- a finger, a piece of dust -- means the end of a 
bubble. To handle bubbles requires hands and equipment thoroughly doused with 
soap solution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflected Light 
</P>
<P>
A bubble's iridescent hues come from two sets of reflected light waves -- one 
bouncing off the outside of the bubble, another off the inside, said Gary 
Chanan, a UC Irvine physics professor. The colors result when the two sets of 
light waves collide or "interfere," he said. Different thicknesses of the soap 
bubble causes different light-wave interference and therefore different colors, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recipes for soap solution vary. Commercial solution is quite light, making thin 
walls so bubbles will float. Bigger bubbles require thicker, sturdier walls. 
Enthusiasts often add glycerin as a thickening agent, and some claim that aging 
the solution overnight improves it. 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman, who often mixes his own solution, recommends a simple recipe: one 
large bottle of baby shampoo (the tearless kind), one tablespoon of glycerin 
and 2 tablespoons of water. 
</P>
<P>
Marks mixes his own solution because he needs 40 gallons per exhibit, enough to 
pour into the inflatable wading pools he uses in his shows. "You should see the 
looks I get when I go into the store and spend $100 on soap solution." 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman said he has learned to respect the power of the simple bubble. Toward 
the end of each play session, tots flock to him, drawn by the pied-piper allure 
of bubbles filling the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Bubbles," he said, "are serious things."

IMPORT PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to register an objection to the San Diego city plan to accept a 
$12-million bid for telephone equipment from a Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
Why should taxpayers contribute to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan just to 
save a few dollars? 
</P>
<P>
On another page of The Times, an article stated that Japan and other Pacific 
Rim countries are being charged with "dumping" telephone products in this 
country by the U.S. government.

COMING CLEAN, NOT WITHOUT SCORN, ABOUT HOUSEWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AGNES HERMAN, Agnes Herman is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were fired last week. My husband says that it was his fault; I believe that 
we were both to blame. When the cleaning company boss called me, she said, "We 
cannot work together so we have taken you off our service." It was not the 
first time our household help fired us. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, when I pointed out dusty corners and cobwebs on the lintels to 
our weekly housekeeper, she replied, "I can't work for you. If I am to be that 
thorough for you, everyone will expect the same service." She was trying to 
balance six jobs each week and to please six different bosses. My complaints 
had thrown her off balance. 
</P>
<P>
I switched gears, eventually, from a self-employed housekeeper to a cleaning 
service staffed by experienced women, bonded and trained. 
</P>
<P>
First, we toured the house, new and clean, orderly and uncluttered, no 
children, no pets. We reached agreement: once every two weeks, two women would 
thoroughly clean our home. The cost was high. The list was long: shutters 
dusted, carpets vacuumed, mirrors polished, tile floor scrubbed, bathrooms 
sanitized. (I never found out what that meant. Perhaps, the small triangular 
fold on the toilet paper rolls discouraged germs.) 
</P>
<P>
Windows would be washed on the inside, never on the outside; the furniture 
would be vacuumed, but, as I discovered, never moved; the bed would be made, 
but the carpet beneath it was a DMZ. I signed a contract and agreed to a 
24-hour cancellation policy, just like the dentist and the Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note at this point that I hate housework. It is a necessary 
evil, because I hate dirt more. Thus, when two resolute women took over our 
home on alternate Tuesdays, I was relieved. I trusted them; they walked in and 
I walked out. 
</P>
<P>
They must have thought that they had found an easy mark. When I returned an 
hour and a half later, they were gone. They were not on roller skates but they 
certainly must have sped around this house. Almost 1,700 square feet, 
thoroughly (!) cleaned in 90 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, it was a miracle. The carpet looked brand new, the kitchen 
floor shone, the roly-poly bugs in the sliding door tracks were gone. The 
mirrors sparkled. Or did they? One was smeared, then another, each reflecting 
the trail of an oily rag. The talcum that settles on everything in the bathroom 
was still on the moldings. Behind the bedroom night table, the tissue I had 
dropped and failed to pick up remained. 
</P>
<P>
So we did a talk-around with the boss, then a walk-around with the employees. 
Sweetness and light; promises, promises: "Thank you for telling us; we need to 
know how best to please you." Poppycock! Employee/employer conversation: make 
nice and she will go off shopping again. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't I fire them immediately? Good question. Over the years, I have fired 
employees. "You are clearly not enjoying your work, so why waste your time. 
Maybe I can help you find a more satisfactory slot." I fired a baby-sitter when 
I found the kids' piggy bank getting lighter after each "sitting." Another 
time, another sitter, we walked into the baby's room and were nearly overcome 
by the odor of whiskey. We attempted to fire that woman on the spot, but she 
was out cold. I knew I would have to do it in the morning, and I did. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of starting again, training new people, is almost as distasteful to 
me as discovering a spider web clinging to a lamp. So this time, we tried a 
masculine approach. 
</P>
<P>
My husband did the walk-around and pointed out dust and dirt they had 
overlooked. Speedy and her partner responded with serious looks and silence, 
which we assumed was acquiescence. Wrong. When they were bonded, the small 
print must have read, "Agree, do not argue, we'll shoot it down later." It was 
the day after they had left us, promising to be "more thorough" that the call 
came: "We are taking you off our service." Unlike what I used to say to my 
volunteers, there was no offer to help me look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
So, while my husband pushes the vacuum (it takes him two hours to do all the 
carpet thoroughly) and I dust the shutters and all of the ledges, I try to 
understand it. Neither of us was ever trained for housework. In grammar school, 
there was something called "homemaking," where we baked cupcakes, learned about 
weights and measures and the importance of scrubbing the sink when we were 
done. That is all I remember. 
</P>
<P>
Today, my kitchen sink is usually spotless. I can still smell the cupcakes, too 
much vanilla, and I recall the stained cookbook. But, that is all. Perhaps my 
mother thought that keeping house would come natural to me; she was wrong. 
Perhaps, too, my homemaking teacher thought I would notice and emulate her 
sparkling, dust-free kitchen, cleaned no doubt by the janitorial staff after 
school ended. 
</P>
<P>
I have done no research on homemaking, but I do know that there are people who 
enjoy keeping houses tidy and spotless, and it really does not matter whether 
it is mine, yours or their own. They love that work. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after that woman fired us six years ago, I discovered Kathleen, a 
delightful and intelligent person with a keen sense of humor. For five years, 
she kept our house glowing. Kathleen never counted hours; instead, she counted 
us as friends and we reciprocated, enthusiastically. If she overlooked 
something, she usually found it before we did. She stayed until she finished, 
whether we were at home or not. She was not bonded and she never folded the 
last sheet of toilet tissue into a tiny triangle. But she did do one terrible 
thing: she moved to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
I believe now, sadly, that a "cleaning service" is that and that alone. I have 
no right to expect it to have a heart, like Kathleen. 
</P>
<P>
There are 23 commercial cleaning services in inland North County. I cannot 
speak about all of them, obviously, but I am skittish about having a parade of 
unfeeling strangers run through my house and stamp it "cleaned," without having 
stopped to find out where they are and who we are. I am naive enough to 
continue believing that, if one is willing to roll up sleeves, soil hands and 
work hard, one should also care. 
</P>
<P>
Our house is our home, with its own aesthetics and with an ambiance that 
reflects us and our way of life. Like yours, our house has its own personality. 
I fear that every house probably looks alike to the cleaning service people. If 
it is Tuesday, it is Lake San Marcos. I would be pleased if, instead, the 
mental message would be, if it is Tuesday, it is the Hermans. 
</P>
<P>
Until we find someone who will care about us and our home, who will say, as 
Kathleen used to: "How are you both feeling today -- how are your children?" my 
husband and I will keep house. We are, thank God, able-bodied. Now I must run; 
it is my turn to scrub the kitchen floor.

REFLECTIONS: 'I WOULD ALWAYS GAZE OUT OVER THE HORIZON AND IMAGINE MYSELF 
FLOATING OFF IN A BALLOON.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Terry Rather, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Kimball says he sells magic. Kimball, a 42-year-old Del Mar resident, 
offers people the chance to glide in a hot-air balloon. The tranquility that 
often accompanies ballooning, he says, gives it an almost mystical aura. In the 
late 1970s, Kimball and a few of his high-school buddies got the notion to sell 
hot-air balloon rides. The result, Napa Valley Balloons, was a blossoming 
success. In 1982, Kimball moved to Del Mar where he started a sister company, A 
Beautiful Morning. When he's not running the business, Kimball competes against 
other balloonists. He recently won the California State Championships. He was 
seeded third for the national championships in Baton Rouge, La., which began 
Saturday. Kimball was interviewed at his A Beautiful Morning office by Times 
staff writer Terry Rather and photographed by Bruce K. Huff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All my life I have been interested in aviation. I can remember as a child in 
school not wanting to be in school. I would always gaze out over the horizon 
and imagine myself floating off in a balloon. It's amazing how that has 
manifested itself. It's almost like it was meant to happen. 
</P>
<P>
I originally got into sail planing when I was 19. I really didn't think I'd be 
interested in any other form of aviation; sail planing is so pure, so clean. 
Then I took a balloon ride when I was 29. I literally went out the next day and 
bought one, I loved it so much. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it was the uniqueness of ballooning that attracted me to it. Six of 
us bought a balloon as a group and did it as a sports club. We all contributed 
to the funds to buy the aircraft and support it and pay for all its 
replacements and repair. Next thing you know, Napa Valley started growing up as 
a tourist center. So we'd be out there flying, and, every time we'd land, we'd 
have all these tourists coming up to us, saying, "How can we get a ride?" 
</P>
<P>
So, after about a year and a half of sport flying around the Napa Valley, we 
decided to start advertising around for balloon rides. It immediately caught on 
and took off like wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
Together with three of my high school partners, we put together one of the 
first rides businesses in the country. We incorporated, went big time and 
bought a whole fleet of balloons. Now, it has evolved into one of largest rides 
companies in the world. 
</P>
<P>
I came down here in 1981 and started A Beautiful Morning -- in Del Mar on my 
own. It's been prospering ever since. 
</P>
<P>
I figured, if I'm going to spend my time, then I might as well spend it doing 
something I love doing. That's one thing about time: No matter how much money 
you have or spend, you can't buy your time back. So you might as well do 
something you love doing. 
</P>
<P>
Ballooning brings happiness to people. Everybody who comes through my office 
and goes flying with us, well, you can see when they leave the reward in their 
faces. It's rewarding dealing with people on a positive level every day. 
</P>
<P>
I always explain to people that I want them to experience it because it is such 
an outrageous experience. I can't explain it. It's because there's no 
sensation. It's almost as though you're watching it on television. You're 
moving with the air. 
</P>
<P>
I get people who have a fear of heights, who start getting weak at the knees 
just from climbing a ladder, every day. No matter how high you are, whenever 
you look down, you just don't get that feeling. There's no way to explain it. 
It's just the serenity and peacefulness of floating on the wind that takes away 
all fear. 
</P>
<P>
I love anything that has to do with aviation, and I love sharing it with people 
and watching their enthusiasm. It's all magic. 
</P>
<P>
Ballooning is now so popular. Last year, both companies flew over 12,000 
passengers. You can go outside now on any Saturday or Sunday, and you'll see 25 
to 30 balloons in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for me now is creating new and different marketplaces. I'm 
working on two- and three-day expeditions, where I would take people on wild 
adventures like flying across the Sierras or across Mt. Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
Ballooning is a great sport and a great industry. I hope to be able to take it 
on to another level.

MANHATTAN BEACH TO LET PUBLIC DECIDE WHAT ART TO KEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS AGUILAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a $20,500 budget, Manhattan Beach is confronting an age-old dilemma: 
sponsoring public art that the public actually likes. 
</P>
<P>
The city is on the verge of installing pieces by five artists under its 
15-month-old public arts program. Officials describe it as their most ambitious 
project. Up until now, the public art program has stuck mainly to tours and 
lectures and showcasing local artists, once even sponsoring a sand castle 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
But this project, which will loan art to the city, involves seven artists and 
curators, some with up-and-coming reputations in the international art scene. 
One artist, a sculptor, has sold in the $100,000 range. Officials are proud 
that the city will be able to run the project on a modest budget. 
</P>
<P>
"This project is without precedent in Manhattan Beach," said Cultural Arts 
Commission Chairperson Paula Benard. " . . . We feel art is important and we 
want to educate the public." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the artists and city officials recognize the inherent risk in 
public art: it generates controversy because you cannot predict the public's 
reaction to art. "But we think we have ways to deal with that, if it arises," 
said Benard. 
</P>
<P>
Their method is to let the public decide which pieces the city buys. Unless 
residents express approval for the works, they will go back to the artists 
after an 18- to 24-month loan period. Benard's panel is deciding how that 
referendum would be run. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the public art program have tried to ensure that the artists 
would create pieces that are compatible with Manhattan Beach and with the sites 
where the works will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Co-curator Peter Frank said: "The city made it very clear that they wanted the 
pieces to be an honest reflection of the community. The pieces are subtle and 
witty and fit into their situations very well. They truly reflect that 
(Manhattan Beach) has a small-town family environment with a youthful spirit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Display Will Be Late 
</P>
<P>
Despite the good intentions and the planning, there are glitches. The most 
obvious one is that the pieces will go on display late. There is disagreement 
about who is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Installation was to begin two weeks ago, but that was the week Public Art 
Administrator Katya Williamson abruptly quit. The target date for the opening 
is now in early September. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the delay was caused by several artists not having their pieces 
ready, and not by Williamson's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, who have been promised that they will receive $2,000 each for the 
loan of their works, say they had problems with the city and still have not 
signed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest surprise to residents may be in artist Kenneth Capps' 
attitude toward Manhattan Beach. It is not very favorable, he said, and that is 
reflected in his work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Visual Puzzle 
</P>
<P>
The works and their artists are: 
</P>
<P>
"Rebus" by Michael Davis and Susan Groetsch. 
</P>
<P>
A rebus is a puzzle that uses pictures and phrases to create a longer word or 
sentence. This one, which will be placed along Manhattan Beach Boulevard, has 
three parts. In the residential section at Aviation Boulevard: a silhouette of 
a man. In the business section at Sepulveda: a silhouette of a hat. In the 
stretch where the street meets the Pacific: the word TAN. 
</P>
<P>
MAN . . . HAT . . . TAN. 
</P>
<P>
The city commissioned Davis to do the piece. Davis, along with his wife, a 
graphic artist, came up with the idea during a brainstorming session in their 
kitchen. "This one presented itself like an apple falling out of a tree," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Groetsch agreed. "They told us to try to think of something that reflects 
Manhattan Beach and this does. Literally." 
</P>
<P>
Capp's work, which is untitled, is four posts that will be set in Polliwog 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The steel poles, which are topped by something that could be a lighting 
fixture, will be placed in different areas of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they are poles ranging from 12 feet to 15 feet. The tops have 
various forms, but really they have no practical function," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The point to a lot of my work is to force people to think about the absurdity 
of symbols they cherish. I think a few people (in Manhattan Beach) could use 
that lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Capps said the "negative energy" he picked up in Manhattan Beach and from its 
residents is reflected in his art. 
</P>
<P>
"That park is very awkward. It's got too much in there. It's like some one 
said, 'Oh, we need this and we need that and now we need art.' And the poles, 
their shapes, can emit this false sense of power and importance. But if you 
think about it, people don't need all that stuff in there." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Isermann's work will decorate the children's section of the county library 
on Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Isermann will bring bright colors, flowers and bean bags to the 25-foot-square 
space. The centerpiece is a steel mobile, 15 feet in diameter, with 20 dangling 
flower shapes. There will also be five kaleidoscope-like designs on wood 
panels. The final touch will be 15 bean bags, regular size. Yellow, orange, 
turquoise and red are the dominant colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope and Innocence 
</P>
<P>
"I think my works were chosen because they wanted a 
love-and-hope-and-innocence-type aura there," Isermann said. "That relates to 
children very well." 
</P>
<P>
"Serpent" and "Dumbbells" by Ann Preston, will be placed at the 20th Street 
Alcove. 
</P>
<P>
Preston's cast-bronze serpent head will jut from a wall along a staircase that 
leads to the beach. The pair of dumbbells will be secured to a nearby bench. 
The pieces are small. The dumbbells, the larger of the pieces, are 15 inches in 
length. 
</P>
<P>
Art critics have noted that Preston's smooth and softly curved sculptures have 
sexual allusions. Preston, who is vacationing in the South Pacific, was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But former Public Arts Administrator Katya Williamson said that the pieces in 
the context of the Manhattan Beach site create a "whimsical effect," not a 
sexual one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Gentle Surprise 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before her resignation, Williamson said the pieces will give 
people a "gentle surprise. Hopefully, they will decide it enhances the 
environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Enhancing the environment is what the public art program is all about, those 
involved in the project say. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us feel that art is truly an essential of life . . . that Manhattan 
Beach will be a better place to live if we can educate the public about art." 
said Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
She said the program's biggest accomplishment so far has been the revamping of 
the city's annual Festival of the Arts so it includes student art work and a 
juried contest for South Bay artists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They've Been Exhibited 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming art-on-loan project is clearly on a different level. The artists 
involved have had their works exhibited in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, 
Japan and Europe. Only Davis is based in South Bay, living and working in San 
Pedro. Isermann and Preston are based in Santa Monica and Capps in Carlsbad. 
Davis has sold work in the $100,000-price range. 
</P>
<P>
The two curators hired by the city, Bonnie Clearwater and Peter Frank, have 
worked on dozens of shows and for major art foundations. The curators, whose 
job was to select the artists and the sites, were paid about $600 each. 
</P>
<P>
With $8,000 set to go to the artists, the remainder of the $20,500 approved by 
the City Council was budgeted for appraisals, insurance, administrative and 
installation costs. Should the residents decide to buy any of the work, the 
city will negotiate a price with the artist. 
</P>
<P>
Said co-curator Clearwater: "I know very little of their other events, but 
clearly one of the signals this project sends out is that Manhattan Beach is an 
up-and-coming community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Plopped Down' 
</P>
<P>
Frank agreed. "Both Bonnie and I tend to avoid public art programs. In fact, 
this is my first, because so much of it is what I call plop art. It's just 
plopped down with no consideration of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Clearwater: "They had a very modest budget for this, but what makes this a 
good program was that it is well thought out and focused." 
</P>
<P>
But clearly there were mistakes. Officials and the artists said they 
underestimated the red tape involved in the project and set an unrealistic 
starting date. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members said that Williamson clashed with her supervisor, Ed Montan, 
assistant director of parks and recreation, over the administration of the 
program, and that eventually led to her resignation. Montan and Williamson last 
week declined to comment on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interim Administrator 
</P>
<P>
Montan, meanwhile, is the interim administrator of the public arts program 
while the city searches for a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the artists -- Davis, Isermann and Capps -- complained they were kept 
in the dark. After visiting the city early in the year to see the sites where 
their work would be installed, they had very little contact with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, I wondered if the project was still on," Isermann said, noting that 
he has received fewer than five phone calls since January to discuss the 
contract, the work, the appraisal or its results. Isermann and Capps 
acknowledge that they did not make a point of calling the city to get answers 
to their questions. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Kenneth Capps. In a project where officials took measures to 
avoid public outcry, Capps is an unexpected wild card. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raise Eyebrows 
</P>
<P>
He expects his work and words to raise eyebrows, he said. "If there isn't 
controversy I would consider it a failure. My job is to get as many people to 
question and think as possible. And some people in Manhattan Beach should wake 
up to this false identity they're getting. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in Inglewood for a while in the '60s and Manhattan was a funky 
beach town with a lot of interesting characters. When I went back to Manhattan 
Beach to look at the park, I was appalled. Now all I see is white sharks in 
tennis shoes with nothing to do but sip coffee in cafes and go shopping in 
quaint little tourist shops. What kind of life is that?" 
</P>
<P>
Counters Mayor Patricia Collins: "We've gotten knocks of becoming 'yuppified' 
before. All I can tell you is the people who move into town are no different 
from us old-timers." Collins has lived in Manhattan Beach for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They are active in civic and church organizations and they care about their 
families," she said. "They just have more money."

A trader on the Chicago Board of Trade was found hanged Friday in his west 
suburban Chicago home just two days after 46 other traders on Chicago's two 
commodities markets were indicted for cheating customers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sorvillo, 45, was pronounced dead at 2 a.m., Du Page County Coroner 
Richard Gallinger said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Sorvillo was among the 100 traders expected to be 
indicted in the next phase of the FBI's Operation Sourmash, a 2 1/2-year 
undercover investigation that led to racketeering, mail fraud and conspiracy 
indictments against traders in the board's soybean and bond pits and the 
Japanese yen and Swiss franc pits at the Chicago Mercantile exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Sorvillo was not among the 46 traders indicted last week. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Sorvillo's body was found by a friend about 1 a.m. Police said 
there were no signs of foul play.

CREWS LOSE, REGAIN GROUND IN BLAZE NEAR PALOMAR MOUNTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weary firefighters lost and then regained ground Saturday to the week-old fire 
that has been burning near Palomar Mountain when gusty winds pushed the flames 
northeast, into the reaches of Cutca Valley and away from the Palomar 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service officials said the fire gained the upper hand for several 
hours, frustrating the efforts of 2,062 firefighters who have been battling the 
stubborn blaze around-the-clock in the Cleveland National Forest. But on 
Saturday night, Forest Service spokeswoman Rosalinda Ewen said the fire had 
burned more than 15,100 acres and was 65% contained. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, officials said the fire had suddenly overwhelmed fire crews 
and declared the blaze only 40% contained. Containment had been estimated at 
58% on Friday. However, late Saturday night Forest Service spokesmen issued 
their first optimistic prediction in a week, and said they expect to have the 
fire under control by 8 p.m. Monday. The cost of fighting the fire has been put 
at $4.4 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a frustrating job. The terrain is very steep with very heavy brush, where 
firefighters and equipment can't reach," said fire official Audrey Hagan. "The 
erratic winds shifted the fire, and we had some blowouts on the east flank, in 
Cutca Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rough terrain and unpredictable winds, firefighters were 
also hampered by 96-degree temperatures and 18% humidity. But, Ewen said that 
Palomar Observatory and Eagle Crag Sanctuary, which is home to endangered 
golden and bald eagles, are no longer in the fire's path. 
</P>
<P>
The new area where the fire was burning is so rough that fire crews had to be 
lifted in and out by helicopters. Firefighters were seemingly reacting to the 
whim of the gusty winds, which propelled the fire from ridge to ridge and into 
the rocky, brush-covered ravines that lie in between. 
</P>
<P>
But the fire's sudden shift in direction also proved to be a blessing for 
firefighters. Ewen said that fire officials were able to issue optimistic 
predictions for final containment because the blaze mostly traveled north from 
Palomar Observatory, into areas that burned in the Aguanga fire of 1985 and the 
16,000 acre Palomar fire of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much left to burn in those areas," Ewen said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began last Saturday south of Vail Lake in Riverside County, was 
sparked by a ricocheting bullet fired by a target shooter.

NEW SAFETY STEPS AT COUNTY'S AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report in the July 18 edition of The Times stated that Orange County's 
airport (John Wayne) ranks seventh in midair near-misses of aircraft. However, 
that terrifying fact was dismissed by one member of the Orange County Airport 
Assn. with the statement that John Wayne was the fifth-busiest airport. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of why we have the "fifth-busiest airport" would open a few eyes 
and put the "fifth busiest" into a completely different perspective. Orange 
County is the fifth busiest because of general aviation (G.A.), and not because 
of commercial aviation, with which most people associate progressive airports. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by airport authorities, in 1988 John Wayne 
Airport had about 533,000 takeoffs and landings. Over 444,000 of these 
operations were due to tiny G.A. planes. In the same time period, Los Angeles 
International had about 623,000 operations, with only 24,000 attributed to G.A. 
aircraft. The comparison is almost humorous. If we are going to rename John 
Wayne airport, then calling it "Orange County General Aviation Airport" might 
be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of mixing the small, single-engine G.A. aircraft with the large 
commercial jet aircraft in flight patterns has been well demonstrated by recent 
crashes resulting in hundreds of dead and millions of dollars in property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly appalling when it is remembered that G.A. operations are 
primarily conducted for fun and sport. It's too bad G.A. flyers aren't on the 
ground to be forced to listen to their own noise as they fly over. 
</P>
<P>
Most major airports in the nation have taken steps to eliminate, or at least 
severely curtail, G.A. operations. It is about time Orange County grows up and 
takes the same steps.

RICH AND POOR ALIKE DESERVE HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is proud of all the surveys that show how economically sound it 
has become and what a wonderful and desirable place it is to live and work. 
</P>
<P>
But the report published last Tuesday in the American Journal of Medicine 
detailing the serious shortcomings of health care for the poor in Orange County 
is no cause for pride. Nor can it be dismissed as something affecting only a 
few people. 
</P>
<P>
The figures and findings are cause for concern in any community, but more so in 
ours because it is so prosperous -- just too well off to simply ignore the 17% 
of the county's population living in households with incomes below the national 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
The study of northern Orange County residents done by UC Irvine researchers for 
St. Jude Hospital found that 37% of the poor who were surveyed lack medical 
insurance and consequently fail to get the basic medical care that other 
residents with money or insurance take for granted. The proportion is far above 
the national average of 27%. One of the scientific study's principal authors, 
Dr. F. Allen Hubbell, concluded that "the indigent care system in Orange County 
is in a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first warning about a care system whose deterioration is of 
vital concern to all residents, not just to the poor and the uninsured. The 
lack of regular medical care puts an added strain on emergency rooms, which 
could force some hospitals to curtail or end those services, creating a 
shortage felt by rich and poor alike. 
</P>
<P>
The financial plight of the UCI Medical Center is well known, and in recent 
budget hearings before the County Board of Supervisors, health-care experts and 
doctors warned that the county's emergency-care system is near collapse and 
that the ability of the medical community to continue to offer care is near the 
breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
The state and federal governments are shortchanging the county, but county 
officials are also shortchanging residents. Despite the county's prosperity and 
all the increases in local tax revenues from rising property values, county 
officials spend less per capita for indigent medical care than do all but two 
of the state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
And the portion of the county budget for welfare and health-care payments to 
the poor has dropped in the past 11 years from 32% to just 19%. In addition, 
funding for health-care programs grew only 16% during the past two years, while 
budgets have grown as much as 228%. 
</P>
<P>
The health-care crisis is a national problem, but that doesn't mean that more 
can't be done locally. The UCI researchers didn't just diagnose the county's 
health-care ills. They also prescribed treatments, recommending more accessible 
health care -- especially prenatal care -- and more educational programs 
emphasizing preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
St. Jude Hospital responded by leasing a van to take medical services into 
areas whose residents do not receive adequate care. It also has started an 
education program and plans to support several health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Others should also respond. County and state officials cannot just cluck about 
survey reports and go on doing nothing, hiding behind the oft-repeated and 
convenient excuse that there isn't enough money. 
</P>
<P>
Some things -- such as health care -- must be provided, and the funds must be 
found. Medical care must be available for all, not just for people with money 
or insurance. The reports on the deteriorating health- and emergency-care 
system in Orange County provide disturbing documentation that when it comes to 
the health of the less affluent, there is far too little curing -- or caring.

21ST-CENTURY IDEAS FOR TRANSPORTATION NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Caltrans Embarks Upon the Road to Tomorrow" (July 24): 
</P>
<P>
More freeways, another lane on our freeways, encouraging more cars on existing 
freeways achieved with new technologies have not and will not solve our 
"transportation dilemma," so aptly described by Tom Nielsen, vice chairman of 
the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
This "freeway gridlock thinking" will add hundreds of millions of dollars to 
the cost of building freeways (what a misnomer), and increase the pollution of 
our already sickly, graying atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it about time we commence to break out of this "gridlock automobile-bound 
thinking" and start contemplating in rational terms transportation alternatives 
for moving people? 
</P>
<P>
Engineering studies show that in many areas of Orange County, including the 5, 
405 and 55 freeways, to provide for the anticipated growth by 1993-95 will 
require 16 to 20 or more lanes in each direction if we think solely in terms of 
the automobile. We must think in 21st-Century terms of "transporting people," 
and refuse to continue to be so influenced and dominated by the automobile 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, for example, under the theme of the "Pulse of Change," is achieving a 
rapidly evolving transportation system, including its high-speed surface 
transport train that has magnetic flotation linear motor propulsion with no 
wheels and is virtually pollution free. 
</P>
<P>
A recent speech by Gov. George Deukmejian has alerted us to the fact that 
billions of dollars are being wasted here in California each year as a result 
of our inadequate and antiquated transportation systems. The freeways and 
parkways of America are among the man-made wonders of the world. However, like 
the pyramids of Egypt, they are rapidly becoming archaic. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than continuing with Caltrans' myopic approach, which is offering more 
of the same congestion and seriously adding to the pollution, many citizens 
say, "Let's put the 'Buckminster Fullers' to work to revive our transportation 
systems to lead us into the 21st Century!" Let's continue to work, not in 
defense and war efforts, but rather work together to improve the quality of 
life for all of us and share with the world practical concepts for moving 
people.

WORKING HOURS OF MEDICAL RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for the interns and resident physicians at UCI (Medical Center) 
who are finally standing up for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
I've worked with obstetrical residents for over 10 years and have watched their 
health and marriages deteriorate during their four years of working over 100 
hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do these physicians in training suffer, but so do the patients under 
their care. Residents care for all patients, not just the indigent or 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
The general public would benefit by knowing how long their doctors have been on 
duty. Patients should simply refuse to be cared for by physicians who have been 
working for longer than 24 hours. For safety reasons, commercial airline pilots 
have a limit on the number of hours they can fly, but there is no limit on the 
hours that a resident can work. After already working a day and a half, a 
physician can perform open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Residency is for learning, not a rite of passage into the medical profession. 
Let's all wake up.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS' OK OF 25% BOOST IN THEIR SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm not amused by the recent 25% pay raise, and recommendation to fix 
subsequent raises to judicial pay scales, unanimously adopted by the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Like many, many taxpayers, I find the pay hikes totally out of line considering 
the pernicious financial condition Orange County is experiencing. Moreover, 
given what I consider to be less than exemplary performances by board members, 
I find the pay increase extraordinarily insulting. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Stanton, defending the hike for alleged lack of opposition, was 
quoted in The Times: "When there are 2.3 million people in the county, the 
percentage (of complaints about the pay hike) was very small." Well, 
supervisors didn't listen last year when hundreds of taxpayers came before the 
board with 40,000 signed letters from Orange County residents and visitors who 
oppose the desecration of Laguna Canyon by the Irvine Co.'s planned housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, I must suggest that the supervisors go out and buy themselves 
hearing aids with their new-found wealth.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS' OK OF 25% BOOST IN THEIR SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to the 25% salary increase that was passed by the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors for themselves. My reaction was more of 
disappointment than shock. My area is represented by Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
and I consider him to be the best-qualified member of the board. I fail to 
understand his motivation in supporting this motion. 
</P>
<P>
The comment attributed to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton regarding the lack of a 
sufficient opposition at the meeting, implied by default that the board had 
received a strong vote of confidence from the general public. I believe this 
could be considered political hyperbole. A merit increase in salaries could be 
justified on the standard of performance. However, in reviewing the problems 
that continue to exist in our county, I do not believe a 25% increase in salary 
is justified. Perhaps the rate of increase should be related to the average 
percentage increase for county employees in general. 
</P>
<P>
The reference that the supervisors' salaries should be similar to salaries paid 
to judges also lacks logic. A current article in the Los Angeles Daily Journal 
regarding the private sector business of judicial arbitration and its effect on 
luring judges from the courts to become employees in that field also cited 
movements by certain members of the Legislature and the judiciary to increase 
the salaries of municipal and superior judges from the $80,000 range to a 
$100,000 area. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, following the supervisors' reasoning process, perhaps their salaries 
should be $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the supervisors want to depend on the comparison to judges, other 
additional factors will be required as to experience, education and passing a 
state test on the knowledge and ethics of being a member of the County Board of 
Supervisors. If this were the case, we might end up with only one supervisor 
remaining on our present board.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS' OK OF 25% BOOST IN THEIR SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Wednesday, July 26, 1989, the Orange County Board of Supervisors unanimously 
voted to grant themselves a salary increase which will provide for 
approximately a 25% raise in salary over the next 11 months. In addition, the 
board action would tie future salary increases to those received by Municipal 
Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
As the president of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, I am very 
interested in salary increases approved for other groups of county employees. 
It is a rare case, indeed, when I view employees being granted a salary 
increase in excess of that received by deputy sheriffs as appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The salary increase for supervisors, however, is long overdue. And its amount, 
in my view, is insufficient. Over 300 members of the county work force receive 
salaries higher than the members of the Board of Supervisors. Not one of those 
employees faces a level of responsibility even approaching that shouldered by 
members of the board. The board members also put in far in excess of an 
eight-hour day or a 40-hour week. They certainly put in many more hours than 
any Municipal Court judge I'm acquainted with, and I'm acquainted with many of 
our Orange County jurists. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing supervisors' salaries to Board of Supervisors members in other 
California counties is also misleading. The office of supervisor is a part-time 
position in other than a very few of the major California counties. 
</P>
<P>
The media tend to give the supervisors almost all the blame for not solving 
almost insoluble problems and very little credit for all the good things we 
enjoy in Orange County. We are fortunate to have the highly qualified, 
dedicated individuals who currently serve on the Board of Supervisors. They, 
and their predecessors, have long worked for a salary that did not begin to 
adequately compensate them for the requirements and demands of their office. 
They should be commended for biting the bullet and taking these needed steps to 
ensure that future members of the board will be compensated at a level more 
closely commensurate to their duties.

HARRIS HAS RIGHT LOOK FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
HE BEATS DODGERS FOR FIRST VICTORY IN HIS NEW ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't matter whether Greg Harris is wearing a Giorgio Armani or his brown 
pinstripe baseball uniform. The teasing and taunts occur daily. 
</P>
<P>
Just once, his Padre teammates say, they'd like to find one hair out of place. 
Or some dirt under his fingernails. Even an unshaved face would do. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the guy," Padre infielder Tim Flannery said, laughing. "Does he look 
like a baseball player?" 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a 25-year-old bachelor who seems to have just stepped out of GQ, 
ignores the ridicule and insults, passing it aside as jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
And if Harris keeps pitching the way he did Saturday in the Padres' 4-2 victory 
over the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, don't be surprised if you find the whole 
darn pitching staff standing in front of the mirror before each game. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, in just his fourth start of the season since leaving the bullpen, 
pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings, allowing four hits in front of 38,421. 
Frustrating the Dodgers with an assortment of curves and fastballs, Harris 
(4-6) allowed just five fly balls to the outfield and only two baserunners to 
second before tiring in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a contrast to his previous three starts since he took over for 
starter Eric Show, who underwent back surgery last week. The Padres lost them 
all and were outscored, 15-4. Harris allowed 11 earned runs in 17 2/3 innings 
for a 5.60 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a must-win situation today, but at this point in the 
season, it was a big win," Harris said. "I know I have to pick it up for us to 
get back in this thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need Eric on the team. I wish he could pitch tomorrow. But he can't. 
And I've got to bust my butt to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Harris afterward explained to reporters how vital it was for him to get 
untracked if the Padres are to have a shot in the division race. He told them 
how he could care less whether he's a starter or reliever, but with Show out 
for the season, he feels he could contribute more as a starter. He tried to 
tell reporters all of this, but constantly he was interrupted by teammates 
trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them how long you combed your hair today, Greg." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you really comb your hair before you take a shower?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them about the time you blow-dried your hair with your baseball cap on?" 
</P>
<P>
These are things inquiring minds want to know, right? 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who indeed does comb his hair before taking the field, refused to 
answer any of the others on the grounds that they could incriminate him. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment, no comment," Harris said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, who doesn't care if his players look like Ton 
Selleck or Tom Lasorda, said the only problem with Harris starting is that it 
creates a void in the bullpen. Mark Grant must assume Harris' role as the setup 
man for Mark Davis, which is fine, McKeon said. But this leaves him him with a 
trio of question marks -- Dave Leiper, Pat Clements and Fred Toliver -- to fill 
Grant's vacated job, a choice that obviously leaves him distressed. But as with 
Friday's upcoming doubleheader, for which McKeon said he has no idea who will 
start, these are times when he can't worry about scrambling roles. 
</P>
<P>
"You really look at our ballclub, and say, 'Where the hell does he fit in with 
Show out?' " McKeon said. "Ideally, you'd like to keep him where was before, in 
the set-up role. Now, he pitches once for you every five days instead of three 
times every five games. But what are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
McKeon is having a similar but more pleasant problem with his starting lineup 
each day. Carmelo Martinez, who has spent more useless time sitting around 
these past two months than the Exxon Valdez, is forcing his way into the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, starting for the fourth consecutive game since May 28-June 4, went 
three for three with two doubles and is hitting .588 (10 for 17) with five RBIs 
since rejoining the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
His play forced first baseman Jack Clark out of the lineup Saturday, but it 
could eventually lead to center fielder Marvell Wynne being benched. McKeon is 
contemplating moving right fielder Tony Gwynn to center, Martinez to first and 
Clark to right. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack's talked to me about it," Gwynn said, "and said don't be surprised if he 
puts me there. I can play center, and whatever it takes this year to help our 
chances to get to the playoffs, I'll do." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Wynne who sent the Padres on their way Saturday in the fourth, 
hitting a three-and-two fastball into the right-field seats. It was his first 
homer since July 5, some 84 at-bats ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James, starting in left after missing the past three games with a 
hip-flexor injury, provided a comfortable 3-0 lead with his two-run homer in 
the sixth. But it was the Padres' final run in the seventh that had those in 
the Padre dugout high-fiving everyone in sight. 
</P>
<P>
With Martinez on first and one out, Benito Santiago singled to center. Center 
fielder Franklin Stubbs kicked the ball, started to pick it up and kicked it 
again. Martinez kept running, and when third-base Coach Sandy Alomar waved him 
home, there was Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia standing in his way at home 
awaiting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The relay from Alfredo Griffin was high, but that didn't stop Martinez from 
throwing a forearm into Scioscia's ribs before stepping onto home plate and 
into an ecstatic dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going crazy when that happened," Gwynn said. "We were slapping guys on 
the back, slapping high-fives, just going nuts. You do that kind of stuff when 
you're playing the Dodgers. The first thing you think about when Scioscia's 
standing there is contact. You don't worry about taking home plate, you're 
thinking about knocking Scioscia down." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers did not score until the ninth, ending bullpen stopper Mark Davis' 
scoreless streak of 19 consecutive innings, but he still wound up with his 
career-high 29th save, which leads the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
It also provided the Padres (55-55) with their eighth victory in the past 11 
games, and enabled them to creep within six games of the second-place Houston 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
What a way to wipe out the memories of the previous night, particularly for 
Gwynn, who was ejected Friday night by rookie umpire Jerry Layne for just the 
third time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Too frustrated to even talk Friday after the Padres' 6-3 defeat, afraid of what 
he just might say, Gwynn arrived to the ballpark Saturday acting almost as if 
the incident had never happened. He dressed, asked McKeon if he could take out 
the lineup card and spent the rest of the morning visiting with a group of 
inner-city kids at Dodger Stadium and standing in the sun for 45 minutes 
signing about 300 autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great day, isn't it?" Gwynn said, strolling into the clubhouse. "I just 
feel good because I'm playing. Sitting there and watching the game on TV last 
night was no fun." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon granted Gwynn's request of bringing out the lineup card with one 
condition: "Don't get your . . . thrown out." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn laughed. Who, me? 
</P>
<P>
True to his word, Gwynn simply ran to home plate with the lineup card, said 
good afternoon to the crew, and ran back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my say last night, he had his say," Gwynn said, "I don't hold any 
grudges. In my own mind, I was right, but there are decisions you're not going 
to agree with. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation, the umpire thought I was showing me up and he had the right 
to throw me out. 
</P>
<P>
"I just lost it last night. I'm not perfect. I'm a human being. I've got an 
attitude problem just like everyone else. I can drop some choice words on 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Gwynn mused, at least he got some national air time. Harris was denied 
his Saturday when NBC canceled their original plans and instead telecast the 
Giants-Astros game. 
</P>
<P>
Gee, just when Harris' hair was combed and everything. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although Manager Jack McKeon said he did not know who his starters would be 
Friday night in the doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves, Padre pitching 
Coach Pat Dobson said that the likely candidates are Dennis Rasmussen and Bruce 
Hurst. Rasmussen would be starting on his regular turn, and Hurst would be 
pitching on three days rest. Don Schulze would then pitch on three days rest 
Saturday. . . . Padre bullpen stopper Mark Davis has been successful in his 
past 11 save opportunities. . . . Dodger outfielder Mickey Hatcher suffered a 
strained left hamstring Friday night when he chased two kids through his 
neighborhood after they broke a window in his home. He finally caught one of 
the kids and called the police. Hatcher says that all he wants is for the kids 
to pay for the window. "I was a kid once, too," Hatcher said, "so I know what 
it's like to do stupid things."

GRAF PUSHED, BUT NOT VERY FAR; 
</P>
<P>
SHE BEATS BUNGE, 6-1, 6-2, WILL MEET GARRISON IN FINAL

<P>
A glance at the score would seem to show that top-ranked Steffi Graf had an 
easy time Saturday against Bettina Bunge in their semifinal match of the Great 
American Bank tennis tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe she did. The 6-1, 6-2 victory over her West German compatriot seems 
remarkably similar to Graf's first three victories in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But something was different. Maybe it was that it lasted 62 minutes, 20 minutes 
more than her previous Graf's tournament match average. Or that Bunge was able 
to extend Graf to a 22-point fifth game in the second set before being broken. 
Or that Bunge won one more game than Graf's first three opponents combined. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was simply that Graf's dominance has made everyone change the 
standard for a competitive match. 
</P>
<P>
It is to the point where Bunge merely winning a point against Graf had the 
sellout crowd of 4,400 cheering, and Bunge celebrating to herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Every point you have to fight so hard, it tires you a little bit," Bunge said. 
"You're so happy when you win one." 
</P>
<P>
Graf has lost just five games in four matches in advancing to the final today 
at 1 p.m. against second-seeded Zina Garrison, who defeated No. 6 Nathalie 
Tauziat of France, 6-1, 7-5, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Even by Graf standards, that is impressive. Never had she lost so few games in 
playing four matches to reach a tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they held such a lopsided series in this city, a court declared 
it illegal and awarded New Zealand the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Graf put a signature touch on her latest conquest by closing the match with 
consecutive aces. 
</P>
<P>
"She was serving like (Ivan) Lendl," Bunge said. "I am sure a lot of the men 
couldn't return them." 
</P>
<P>
It was not the only time she froze Bunge. At least a half-dozen times, she did 
not take a step toward a Graf winner. Other times she came in for a volley only 
to watch Graf's return go fly past her before she got much past the service 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them, the ball was so fast, you don't have a chance," Bunge said. "If 
you hit the ball a bit too short, a little bit defensive, you get punished 
right away. You are not going to get away with getting the ball in and hoping 
she will miss." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the score, Bunge did take some consolation from her performance. The 
match was only her fourth in singles competition since November 1987. Knee and 
foot surgeries forced her to take a 20-month layoff. She began her comeback 
this week with Graf-like victories over No. 5 Lori McNeil (6-2, 6-0) and Jo 
Durie (6-1, 6-1) before a tough, three-set quarterfinal victory Friday over 
last year's San Diego runner-up, Ann Grossman (2-6, 7-5, 6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Her comeback will continue this week at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles 
tournament at the Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the match, my knee was really sore," Bunge said. "I was pretty worried 
about it, but in the match I didn't really feel it at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I was quite pleased. . . . I hadn't played a (big) 
match like that in years, even before I stopped in 1987." 
</P>
<P>
The layoff had Graf wondering how competitively Bunge would play. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't know what to expect because I hadn't seen her play (in so 
long)," Graf said. "But I know she has the touch, and I know she knows how to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, both players are well acquainted with each other. Bunge, 26, recalls 
seeing Graf for first time in 1981 when she was ranked in the top 10 and Graf 
was a junior player. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a training camp in Germany when Claudia (Kohde-Kilsch) and I were 
big stars," Bunge said. "(Steffi) was 12 years old, a skinny girl. She was so 
good. God, she was already so good." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Bunge lost to her at Wimbledon in their first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"She was 13 or 14 (actually just turned 15)," Bunge said. "I wasn't upset 
because I knew she was exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
Their previous most recent match had been a 6-1, 6-1 Graf victory in Los 
Angeles in 1987. This was their fifth career meeting; Bunge has yet to win a 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Graf allowed Bunge only two points off her serve in the first set. At one point 
over the first and second sets, Graf scored 16 consecutive points on serve. 
</P>
<P>
Bunge toughened as the match continued. Her persistence showed, but was not 
rewarded, in fifth game of the second set, when she played Graf 22 points 
before being broken. Bunge won 10 points in the game, as many as she won in the 
entire first set. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I was little too careful, and I got punished with some 
blistering returns," Bunge said. "I was trying to at least prove to her that I 
could give her a good match, that (every match) is not totally boring for her." 
</P>
<P>
Graf might expect an even better match from Garrison, who actually owns a 
three-set victory over her, although it was four years ago in their first 
meeting. The last time they played, in the final of an indoor tournament in 
Washington in February, Graf won 6-1, 7-5. It was her fourth consecutive 
victory over the world's sixth-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
The close second set followed a first set in which Graf won the first 20 points 
to lead, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
The final will be Garrison's fifth in 12 tournaments this year. She is coming 
off her second title of the year -- a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Pam Shriver in 
Newport, R.I., two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison said her strategy today will be simple, the risks high. 
</P>
<P>
"I have got to get more first serves in, a lot more than I've been getting in," 
Garrison said. "And on her second serve, I'll have to attack, no matter what. 
If I get passed 99 times, I've got to let her pass me. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Steffi is you have to go out there and say, 'I'm going to be 
aggressive.' You know she is going to be aggressive. You're not going to be 
given many opportunities, and when you do you have to take advantage of it."

DALLAS GREEN RESPONDS FORCEFULLY TO GEORGE STEINBRENNER'S CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM BRADY, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dallas Green on Thursday responded to criticism from owner George Steinbrenner 
with the most forceful rebuttal from a New York Yankees manager since Gene 
Michael's "fire me" challenge in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
With subtle sarcasm, Green refuted Steinbrenner's second-guessing and clearly 
implied the owner has a novice understanding of baseball. He even ridiculed the 
owner, saying: "The statement that 'Manager' George made about the game is a 
very logical second-guess. And hindsight being 20-20, that's why managers go 
gray ... It's always easier to (criticize) from above." 
</P>
<P>
Green seemed unafraid of a public confrontation with the owner and seemed to 
challenge him to it. "What better forum than New York City?" he said. "When and 
where. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the point (Steinbrenner was trying to make)," he said. "You have 
to shunt it and shut it off." 
</P>
<P>
The owner offered his opinions after the Yankees' doubleheader split with the 
Minnesota Twins on Wednesday night. He called a reporter in the Yankee Stadium 
press box and, unsolicited, complained about the performance of the Yankees' 
coaching staff and two moves Green made during the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's first public disagreement with his first-year manager involved 
Green's positioning of his outfielders with the Yankees ahead, 7-6, in the 
ninth inning of the first game. Green had them play back to prevent an 
extra-base hit. Although power-hitting Kent Hrbek did drop a two-out hit into 
shallow left field and reach third on Brian Harper's hard double over third 
base, Dave Righetti was able to get the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"In 15 years, I've never seen outfielders play with their backs to the wall as 
they were doing in the first game," Steinbrenner said. "It almost cost us when 
they got two hits in front of the fielders (actually one)." 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, with the game tied at 3 in the ninth inning, the Yankees 
loaded the bases with none out. They squandered the opportunity when 
left-handed-hitting Hal Morris struck out against left-hander Dave West, Don 
Mattingly hit a short fly to left off West with the Twins' outfield playing 
shallow, and Steve Balboni bounced into a force play against Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
"A manager has to find a way to score a run in a situation like that," 
Steinbrenner said. "Why not send up (Randy) Velarde to hit for Morris? Then if 
they bring in Reardon, at least you have Mattingly batting against a 
right-hander." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the owner's second-guessing, Green questioned Steinbrenner's 
knowledge of baseball. "I've known a lot of owners who can talk the lingo (of 
baseball)," he said. "Once in a while, you have to sit down and talk logical 
baseball sense, common sense. That doesn't happen much here." 
</P>
<P>
After the games, Steinbrenner told the New York Daily News, "From what I saw 
tonight, the manager and the coaches are going to have to do a better job for 
us to win." He was unavailable for comment Thursday night.

THERE AREN'T ENOUGH GOOD PITCHERS FOR ONE MAJOR LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Give us this day our daily baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Would someone kindly explain what's happened to pitching on the major-league 
level? Four months into the season and after more than a hundred games had been 
played, just one of the 28 pitchers scheduled to start Tuesday's games had won 
at least 10 games (Kansas City's Bret Saberhagen). Listen to the records of 
some of the guys getting starts: McWilliams (2-10), Young (2-8), Rawley (4-8). 
</P>
<P>
Time was when even the dregs of the leagues had a terrific pitcher or two. Ned 
Garver, for instance, was 20-12 with the St. Louis Browns (52-102) of 1951 and, 
the same season, Murray Dickson went 20-16 with the Pittsburgh Pirates (64-90). 
</P>
<P>
And they're talking about starting eight to 12 teams in a new league? Maybe 
they plan on letting guys hit the ball out of their hand. 
</P>
<P>
Some things you might not have known or forgotten about Hall of Famer Carl 
Yastrzesmki: He smacked 26 consecutive hits in high school ... he was signed 
out of his freshman year at Notre Dame as an infielder, but 45 errors at 
Raleigh in the Carolina League that summer prompted the move to the outfield 
... during 23 seasons, he was placed on the disabled list just once. 
</P>
<P>
Forget all the business of the Pete Rose case being heard in a federal or state 
court. The only place for it is the front steps of the Hall of Fame in 
Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
When the bedraggled Birds return to 33rd Street to host the Texas Rangers 
Friday night, fans will be greeted by a ballot soliciting their opinion 
concerning the greatest moment in baseball history. A panel of 20 sportswriters 
selected the 20 entries to be voted upon in the search, which is underwritten 
by MasterCard. If the Bobby Thomson "shot heard 'round the world" in 1951 
doesn't prevail, something's rotten in the ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
The DH rule was supposed to lead to more complete games in the American League, 
eh? Listen to these totals after 104 games: the White Sox (4), Orioles and 
Mariners (6), Yankees (8) and Brewers (9). Each of the last two years Sandy 
Koufax pitched, he completed 27 games. Juan Marichal completed 30 of 38 games 
started one year. Even Jim "Save My ERA" Palmer completed 20 or so several 
times. We won't even mention Iron Man McGinnity's numbers. 
</P>
<P>
While it's true Dwight Evans has had a fine career playing for the Red Sox -- 
359 home runs, seven Gold Gloves, etc. -- he says his proudest accomplishment 
is that he's been driving for 18 years in the Boston area and has never been 
involved in even a minor fender-bender. This puts Joe DiMaggio's 56-game 
hitting streak to shame, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
In this day and age, when nearly every anniversary of an event in the game is 
celebrated, no matter how obscure, it boggles the senses to learn that the 
100th anniversary of Brooklyn's first championship, the American Association 
title in 1889, will pass almost unnoticed. Back then, with no American League, 
the AA victor used to challenge the National League champion. The New York 
Giants just did nip the Dodgers in a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
During Hall of Fame weekend, Robin Roberts told a story about how he got word 
that he was going to pitch the final and deciding game against the Dodgers with 
the two teams tied for first place. An hour before the game, Manager Eddie 
Sawyer came over to Roberts and said, "Good luck today," to the right-hander 
who would be making his third start in five days. A couple of years before, the 
Red Sox were going into a one-game playoff against the Cleveland Indians and 
Manager Joe McCarthy asked for a volunteer to pitch. By the simple act of 
raising his hand, Denny Galehouse (8-8) got the assignment and Boston got 
hammered. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows what a great baseball park Wrigley Field is as it celebrates 
its 75th anniversary. But no less a great than quarterback Sid Luckman of the 
Chicago Bears says, "Wrigley was the best place in the league to play football. 
I wish they had stadiums like it today." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the days when the Red Sox used to abdicate the pennant race by the 
middle of May, one of the features of games at Fenway Park was when the infield 
was dragged smooth after five innings. The guys dragging the mat were easily 
two of the oldest men in New England and, sometimes, they took an hour to 
complete their appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for dragging infields was hatched 40 years ago in the Pacific Coast 
League when a concessionaire for the Hollywood Stars was looking for a way to 
boost sales. The infield manicure job provided a 10-minute break in the action, 
giving fans plenty of time for a refreshment break. 
</P>
<P>
Add concessions: It's a proven fact that no matter how bad the weather or how 
menacing the forecast, they will not call a game in Chicago's Comiskey Park 
until all the hot dogs have been sold. "Can't rewarm 'em and sell 'em the next 
day," Bill Veeck once explained. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers will remember Buddy Hassett. He was a first baseman who played for 
the Dodgers and Braves in the National League and the Yankees in the American 
for seven years before heading off to World War II. He hit for a pretty good 
average (.292), never struck out, stole some bases, was a good pinch-hitter and 
was a classy first baseman. Back from the war, Hassett waited and waited for 
someone to call offering a job. No team did. Must have had either dumb general 
managers or lousy phone service back then. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, Jesse Gonder's name came up in a conversation the other day.

BLYLEVEN IS BACK ON HIS GAME

<P>
Bert Blyleven of the California Angels has turned around a pitching career that 
seemed ready to fade to black last season when he lost an American League high 
17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, getting a fresh start with the California Angels at age 38, is 11-2 
with a 2.31 earned run average after pitching his 58th career shutout -- a 7-0, 
six-hit victory over the Seattle Mariners Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very fortunate to win a lot of ball games," Blyleven said. "It's 
just been consistency over the years. That's all it takes." 
</P>
<P>
In his 20th major league season, Blyleven hasn't lost since May 20. He's 7-0 
with six no decisions in his last 13 starts, including two shutouts. He has 
three shutouts for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven was consistent in Minnesota last season -- consistently poor. He was 
10-17 with a 5.43 ERA, the worst ERA of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven said he was bothered all season by a sore right thumb. The Twins 
thought he was finished. He asked to be traded to the Angels and Minnesota 
accommodated him. 
</P>
<P>
He signed a one-year, $1.1 million contract with California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really want to dwell on different years," Blyleven said. "It's a 
different year. I'm on a new ball club. I'm just thankful we're in the race." 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the Angels weren't supposed to even be close to the defending 
American League champion Oakland Athletics in the West this year. But the 
Angels woke up Thursday morning just a half game behind the Athletics after 
leading the division for 23 days before giving up first place with an 8-1 loss 
to the Mariners Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good ballclub," Blyleven said. "We've worked hard to get to where 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven halted a three-game Angels losing skid. He says he enjoys the pressure 
of pitching in big games. He halted a five-game California losing streak when 
he beat Toronto 1-0 in the Sky Dome July 18. 
</P>
<P>
The man who was born in Zeist, Holland, has pitched for Texas, Pittsburgh and 
Cleveland in addition to two stints in Minnesota in a big league career that 
began in 1970 when he was the AL Rookie Pitcher of the Year for the Twins as a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at baseball as something I'm very fortunate to play," he said. "I love 
the game very much. Not as Hank Aaron says nobody loves it any more. I really 
do love it. I play it because I couldn't be a brain surgeon. Maybe I would have 
loved being a brain surgeon, too. But I didn't get my high school diploma." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Blyleven went to high school in Garden Grove, Calif., near Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Last season obviously rankles him. Asked if he thought he should be considered 
for AL Comeback Player of the Year, he replied dryly, "I didn't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Then he said, "I think the Comeback Player of the Year should be someone who 
comes off of surgery or something like that. There was nothing wrong with me 
last year other than a couple physical things. Now, I've got proof that I'm 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
With the Angels and his career pointed in the right direction, Blyleven even 
can find humor in his sore thumb of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the Dutch in me," he said. "I just put the thumb in the wrong place."

THIS IS A NEW FRANK ROBINSON -- OR IS IT? 
</P>

<P>
Frank Robinson insists he hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there he is signing all those autographs for fans. And there he is in those 
clubhouse card games with players. And what about those funny exchanges in his 
pre-game sessions with reporters? 
</P>
<P>
These were not part of his first two swings as a baseball manager. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Robinson says, "I think I am still the same person I always was." 
</P>
<P>
When pressed, he admits, "I have come to know what I have to do and how to 
approach a situation. This (managing the Baltimore Orioles) is a situation with 
younger players. I have to be much more patient, take a gentle-type approach. I 
knew that coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The patience and gentle intuition Robinson has shown this year has been a big 
reason why the Orioles, with the youngest roster in baseball, have made their 
unexpected run for the American League East Division crown. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 53, may be as big a surprise as the young team that has been on top 
of the American League East most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the impression last winter that Frank had matured and mellowed," 
Milwaukee general manager Harry Daulton told the Washington Post. "Lord knows, 
he knows the game as well as anybody. He understands the importance of doing 
the intangible things. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I expected it. At one point, you wondered if he'd adjust -- 
looking at what happened in Cleveland, San Francisco. Some fellas don't catch 
up to the new generation." 
</P>
<P>
What happened in Cleveland (1975-77) and San Francisco (1981-84) could be 
described as a manager lacking patience for the errors of that new generation. 
In both places, Robinson was quick to lash out at players and reporters alike. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain things used to set me off," Robinson said. "When players or reporters 
would say things challenging my position sometimes, challenging me ... in years 
past, they'd ask me questions and I'd come back at you. 
</P>
<P>
"... Now, I'm able to kind of absorb it. I understand where they're coming 
from." 
</P>
<P>
It is an understanding that did not come easy for Robinson, an uncompromising 
competitor who hit 586 home runs during his 21-year playing career -- fourth 
best in history -- and also was hit by a pitch 198 times. He didn't speak to 
opposing pitchers and would yell at a teammate who'd made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of hardnosed approach, which he carried over to his term with 
Cleveland as the first black manager in baseball history, has not been there 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"After I was fired for the second time as manager, I think I finally got a 
different perspective on myself," Robinson said. "After I looked at myself and 
the way I'd lived, maybe I was wrong more than I was right. Maybe it's not the 
way you look at yourself, but the way other people see you. 
</P>
<P>
"I studied Frank Robinson, putting things in order and deciding this is what 
Frank Robinson wants to accomplish and this is who he wants to be." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Robinson still draws the line when he believes he has to. He yanked 
Brady Anderson from a game for not running out a ground ball, and he called for 
an off-day mandatory practice when he thought it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the incident with those umpires. 
</P>
<P>
After a dispute with umpires in Milwaukee on July 9, Robinson threatened to 
resign. He said he was "sick and tired" of the unwillingness of umpires to 
listen to his arguments, and that he was "seriously thinking of stepping 
aside." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson met with American League President Dr. Bobby Brown, and said 
afterwards that the matter was over and that he would not resign the position 
that, a couple of years ago, he thought was beyond his reach. 
</P>
<P>
After he was fired by the Giants five years ago, Robinson thought he might 
never get another chance to manage again. "After a couple years I said maybe 
that was it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was named the Orioles' manager six games into last season and was 
forced to endure a miserable season in which the team compiled baseball's worst 
record before overseeing the team's plan to rebuild through youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people thought I was the wrong man for this job," Robinson 
said. "They didn't think I had the patience to manage young players. ... People 
don't think I can do a lot of things. They don't think I'm able to make 
adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
This year was going to be different for Robinson no matter how the Orioles 
played. This was the first time he's ever been allowed to choose his own 
coaching staff, and he hired former major leaguers Al Jackson and Tommy McCraw, 
who both had been in the New York Mets' minor league system, as his pitching 
and hitting coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles also have a front office confident in Robinson, and committed to 
rebuilding, ready for the pains and pleasures of the process. That was not the 
case in either Cleveland or San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important part about this situation is that we're all going in the 
same direction," Robinson said. "They know what I want. I've never had that 
before." 
</P>
<P>
He's never had such an approachable way with his players before either. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've always tried to be is open and honest with my players and do 
what's best for them," Robinson said. "It didn't always come across that way. I 
think the players feel more at ease around me, that they can approach me better 
now than before." 
</P>
<P>
The players notice it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that he was not communicative, hard to get along with, a mean guy," 
said Baltimore pitcher Dave Schmidt. "I don't see those things. As long as you 
play hard, I don't see how you can have any problems with him." 
</P>
<P>
One thing about Robinson's managing that has not changed is his personality 
during a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't laugh and joke during a game and see what's going on," Robinson said. 
"... It's total concentration while the game is going on. You do that to get 
yourself an edge." 
</P>
<P>
That edge is all Robinson has been looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"People think things have come easy for me," Robinson said. "I worked hard to 
make myself a good player, and I worked hard to be a better manager." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Frank is right. Maybe he hasn't changed.

PGA TOURNAMENT HAS MANY SUBPLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREEN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HAWTHORN WOODS, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 71st PGA National Championship has more subplots than a soap opera. The 
tournament that starts on Thursday is more than the year's final event of 
golf's Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
It's the last appearance in a major tournament for Jack Nicklaus and Lee 
Trevino before they pass into the Seniors category. It's also 39-year-old Tom 
Watson's chance to become only the fifth man to complete a career sweep of all 
four major titles. 
</P>
<P>
It's yet another chance for Greg Norman to try to bounce back from yet another 
major-title near miss. And it's yet another round in the American vs. foreign 
player fight for golf domination. 
</P>
<P>
It's the end of a two-year scramble for positions on the American Ryder Cup 
team that will face Europe's best in England next month. And it could mean an 
early end to the Player of the Year race. 
</P>
<P>
That latter category could come about only if Masters champ Nick Faldo of 
England, U.S. Open title-holder Curtis Strange or British Open winner Mark 
Calcavecchia could annex the PGA crown. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, Calcavecchia would appear to have the best chance. A notorious 
streak player, he has not competed since his playoff victory in the British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Two major titles in a single season -- something that hasn't occurred since 
Watson won the 1982 U.S. and British Opens -- almost certainly would provide a 
player an insurmountable lead in the point standings. 
</P>
<P>
But it is another point list, the Ryder Cup list, that will gain a major 
portion of the attention. It is from that list that 10 of the 12 men on the 
American team will be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Points were awarded for top 10 finishes beginning with the first tournament of 
1988. The list closes with the PGA, which also awards bonus points. 
</P>
<P>
The top seven players -- Calcavecchia, Strange, Chip Beck, Tom Kite, Paul 
Azinger and Payne Stewart -- are virtually assured of places on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Eight others are in a battle for the remaining three spots on the point list. 
They are Ken Green, Mark O'Meara, Mark McCumber, Steve Pate, Joey Sindelar, 
Bruce Lietzke, Ben Crenshaw, Scott Hoch and Lanny Wadkins. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Captain Ray Floyd is allowed to pick one player. The 12th spot is 
reserved for the PGA champion, if he is eligible. If he is not, or if he is 
among the top-10 point winners, Floyd can pick two players. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been in an extended slump, Watson's strong performance in the 
British Open makes him a major contender as one of Floyd's possible selections. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in a long, long time I feel like I'm in control of my game 
again," Watson said after he finished fourth, two shots out of the British Open 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
That solid showing by the man who once dominated golf also added to the 
possibility he could join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Nicklaus and Gary Player as 
the only men to make career sweeps of the Masters, U.S. and British Opens and 
the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
Watson has won five British Opens, two Masters and the 1982 U.S. Open. He lacks 
only the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my No. l career goal in golf," said Watson, who has had more than 
enough of the "us vs. them" talk concerning rivalry between American and 
foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of talking about it. I'm tired of being asked about it. We don't 
think of it in those terms," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the leading European players will be missing from the 150-man 
line-up. Sandy Lyle, former Masters and British Open champion, declined to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
Other major foreign players include Faldo, Ian Woosnam of Wales, Bernhard 
Langer of West Germany, Seve Ballesteros and Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain, 
David Frost of South Africa. And Greg Norman of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Norman -- who lost the 1984 U.S.Open in a playoff, was the victim of Bob Tway's 
1987 sand shot in the PGA and Larry Mize's playoff pitch-in in the 1988 Masters 
-- again lost a major-tournament title when he came from seven shots back to 
tie in the last round of the British Open, then was beaten by Calcavecchia in a 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough. He'll be back," Calcavecchia said. 
</P>
<P>
Some other major contenders include defending champion Jeff Sluman, Stewart, 
Strange, Azinger, Couples, McCumber and Kite, who has won twice and leads the 
American money-winners this season. 
</P>
<P>
The total purse ($1 million last year) and the winner's share will be announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will provide live television coverage 10 a.m. to Noon and 1-4 p.m. (PDT) 
Thursday and Friday and ABC will have live coverage of the final two rounds 
Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. (PDT).

Kemper Lakes, a 10-year-old public course where the 71st PGA championship will 
be played this week, is a huge, demanding layout with water coming into play on 
11 of the holes. 
</P>
<P>
Emil Esposito, the home pro, figures anywhere from even par to 12-under could 
win the 72-hole tournament over the 7,197-yard, par 36-36 -- 72 layout. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on the wind," said Esposito. "If the wind blows during the 
tournament, I'd be willing to put up par or 1-under and let them shoot at that. 
If it isn't blowing, 10 or 12-under can win. That's how good those guys are. 
</P>
<P>
"The course record will go down," said Esposito, "because somewhere along the 
line somebody will shoot a 66 or 65." 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of pros have seen the course. The PGA Grand Slam, a charity 
exhibition with four leading pros playing with four amateurs, has been held at 
Kemper Lakes three times. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman has participated in all three and set the course record with a 70 
but that was broken in 1988 by Larry Nelson with a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Norman was the central figure in a controversy over the 18th hole, a 433-yard 
par-4 dogleg left with the tee shot carrying over water. 
</P>
<P>
Norman tried a shortcut over the corner of the lake in 1988, hitting a drive of 
some 300 yards downwind onto the green. Last April three 30-foot honey locust 
trees were planted, theoretically blocking the shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't stop Norman last Memorial Day. He tried it again, drove over the 
trees and landed in a greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
"I might try it in the tournament, it depends on the situation," said Norman. 
"If you don't carry the water, you're looking at double bogey." 
</P>
<P>
The rough will be four inches during the tournament and Exposito said "You have 
to use a 7, 8 or 9-iron to get out. Only a strong guy like Norman can get out 
of it with a 6-iron. You have options on this course and you'd better respect 
it or it will jump at you with a double bogey real quick."

CONEJO VALLEY ADVANCES TO REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Naster pitched four shutout innings of relief and hit a three-run double 
to lead Conejo Valley to a 10-4 victory over South El Monte on Saturday in the 
championship game of the Senior League (15-year-old) state divisional baseball 
tournament in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
South El Monte defeated Conejo Valley, 7-1, in an earlier contest to force the 
championship game. Conejo Valley advances to the Western Regional tournament, 
beginning Monday in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Naster's double gave Conejo Valley a 6-4 lead in the fifth inning of the second 
game. Adam West had given Conejo Valley a 3-0 lead with a three-run home run in 
the third inning. Trent Martin was three for three for Conejo Valley and Brian 
Capella, Jeff Olin and Ryan Kritscher each had two hits. Olin had five hits on 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley (12-2) won district and sectional championships to advance to 
state divisional play. This is the first Conejo Valley team in the league's 27 
years to win a state divisional title.

SKEELS UNABLE TO MASK DESIRE FOR A TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Henson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosperous situation for the San Diego Padres has placed Andy Skeels in a 
most uncomfortable position. And it has nothing to do with the fact that he is 
asked to squat behind the plate nearly every night. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are blessed with a full rack of talented catchers. At the top, of 
course, is National League All-Star Benito Santiago. Not far behind, at 
triple-A Las Vegas, is Sandy Alomar Jr., one of the hottest prospects in 
baseball. Further down the line, at Class-A Riverside, is Skeels, a Thousand 
Oaks High graduate who was drafted in 1987 after setting the single-season home 
run record (18) at the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing his prospects of moving up in the Padre organization as dim, Skeels 
hopes that some smart shopper lifts him off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely begging for a trade," he said. "If I weren't in this 
organization, I'd be in triple-A, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, Skeels has batted better than .300 for the past two months 
to improve his average to .261. He also has 14 doubles, four triples, one home 
run and 36 runs batted in. This is his second season at Riverside after playing 
his first professional season at Spokane, Wash., in the rookie Northwest 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Heightening his frustration is a feeling that the Padres are reluctant to trade 
any of their catchers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like a kid with lots of toys. The minute someone else wants to play 
with one, they say, 'No, no, you can't have that one,' even though they haven't 
given it any attention in a month," Skeels said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Romenesko, the Padres' minor-league director, talks like a kid with a chest 
full of toys. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fortunate to have two high-profile catchers, and we have several more 
interesting catchers at the minor-league level," Romenesko said. "Catching is 
one of the most difficult positions in the industry, and you can never have 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
The backlog of backstops has piqued the interest of other teams, however. And 
there is interest in Skeels. "Andy's been heavily scouted," Romenesko said. 
</P>
<P>
But until -- or if -- a move is made, there is nothing Skeels can do but strap 
on the mask and present to the world a broad smile and a hard swing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to find out if I can play or not," he said. "In our organization, I'm 
nobody. Their business is to play who they think is best. I'm a grown man, I 
can handle that. I'll be at the park tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Buying time: After mostly watching from the bench as Arizona won the Division I 
national championship in 1986, Pat Waid of Camarillo probably figured the clock 
was running out on his baseball career. He was a backup outfielder again in 
1987, his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
But perseverance has paid off for Waid. He called around to independent 
minor-league teams and landed a tryout last year with the Salt Lake City 
Trappers of the Class-A Pioneer League. Not only did he make the team, he 
batted leadoff, played center field and was among the league leaders in stolen 
bases, with 15 in a 70-game season. 
</P>
<P>
Waid, who played for two years at Oxnard College before transferring to 
Arizona, has improved his batting average from .280 last season to .326 and he 
has five home runs, 24 RBIs and seven stolen bases. Now, time is on his side. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat has a real good chance of being picked up by a major league organization 
at the end of this year," said Holly Andretta, the Trappers' assistant general 
manager. "He was nearly signed by the Reds after last season and he has got a 
lot stronger since then." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking ground: Gino Tagliaferri's first professional hit was not a booming 
home run of the type that were his signature at Kennedy High the past three 
years. But because it was his first hit, his single up the middle Tuesday might 
be more memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, the City Section single-season home run champion, has made several 
adjustments since reporting last week to Niagara Falls, N.Y., of the Class-A 
New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
"He says the pitchers really throw gas," said Gene Tagliaferri, Gino's father. 
"He's adjusting to the wood bat and he's adjusting to the weather. It's always 
cloudy and humid." 
</P>
<P>
Another change for Tagliaferri is his position -- third base after a high 
school career at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
But the most change Tagliaferri will see is due Jan. 15, which happens to be 
his 19th birthday. That's the day he receives the second half of his signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Another hunch, by George: Longtime San Francisco Giants scout George Genovese 
of North Hollywood has signed several longshots who have enjoyed long careers 
in the major leagues. In addition to sure things like Bobby Bonds, Chili Davis 
and Jack Clark, Genovese has taken chances on players like Gary Mathews and 
Eric King, players no other scout would touch. 
</P>
<P>
John Chiaramonte of Westlake High and Moorpark College is Genovese's latest 
gamble. After signing in June, Chiaramonte was assigned to Pocatello, Ida., of 
the Class-A Pioneer League. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily a knuckleball pitcher in high school, Chiaramonte has gotten 
progressively stronger and has developed an impressive array of pitches. The 
right-hander was 7-1 at Moorpark last season and was named the team's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's averaging a strikeout an inning," Genovese said. "He kind of reminds me 
of (Dan) Quisenberry, who wasn't overpowering when he signed. John brings the 
ball from all over but he can be rough with his sidearm delivery. When he drops 
down, his ball really sinks." 
</P>
<P>
Genovese is impressed by Chiaramonte's head as much as his arm. "I love his 
general makeup, he seems to be a competitor," Genovese said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Pocatello: The last Valley-area player signed by Genovese prior to 
Chiaramonte was Joey Speakes of Poly High. Speakes is also at Pocatello, where 
he starts in the outfield. A single performance in the 1987 City Section 
playoffs told Genovese volumes about Speakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Poly knocked Chatsworth from the playoffs and Joey really performed in the 
clutch at bat and in the outfield," Genovese said. "That one game told me that 
he was professional material. I decided that day to draft him."

THEY'RE LEFT-HANDED COMPLEMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
LEFTIES PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN WATER POLO TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a world where right means correct and right-handers have the last consumer 
word, left-handers are making themselves heard. 
</P>
<P>
The positive attributes of the left-handed are noted on shirts, bumper stickers 
and other novelty items. Speciality shops cater to left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
And at the U.S. Senior Men's National Water Polo Championship at UC San Diego's 
Canyon View Pool, lefties also are making some noise. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 103 players participating on eight teams Saturday, only 13 are 
left-handed. But after four games, which whittled the field in the round-robin 
tournament to four for today's finals, four of the top six scorers were 
left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"Each good team has at least one," said Dante Dettamanti, assistant national 
and Stanford team coach. Stanford, with two lefties -- 1988 Olympian Craig 
Klass and ambidextrous Eric Blum -- advanced to today's championship rounds 
with a 9-7 victory over Newport B and a 7-5 upset of previously undefeated and 
top-seeded Newport A. 
</P>
<P>
"You like to have them on your team," Dettamanti said. "It's an advantage. They 
throw the defenders off." 
</P>
<P>
What they were throwing on this day were goals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a significant advantage," said Harvard Academy Coach Richard Corso, who 
with four lefties has an unusually high number on his team. 
</P>
<P>
"They balance the front-court offense and the power play. They're important in 
picks and screens, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The surviving lefties going into today's final competition are those of Malibu 
(4-0), Geoff Clark and goalie Craig Wilson; Stanford (3-1), Klass and Blum, and 
Beach (3-1), Nick Baba and James Makshanoff. Newport A (3-1) has none. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a left-hander on Newport A -- packed with nine national team 
members and three former Olympians -- dispels any notion that being left-handed 
alone is enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be good," Dettamanti said. "If you have to choose between a weak 
left-handed player and a strong right-handed player, then you always go with 
the strong right-hander." 
</P>
<P>
Malibu's Clark, the leading scorer on Australia's 1988 Olympic team, is the 
second-leading scorer (14 goals in four games) in this tournament. Malibu 
advanced to the final four with an 8-5 victory over Harvard Academy and a 11-9 
victory over Golden Bear. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows all the best players in the world are left-handed," said Clark 
with a smile. "Everyone's expecting you to shoot from the other side. You're 
just not used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Even the left-handed players don't like playing against other lefties. 
</P>
<P>
"I myself don't like (guarding a left-hander)," said Clark, a sophomore at 
Pepperdine. "Everything's harder against them. The timing's different, the 
angles are different." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bruin Polo's Alexis Rousseau, who scored 12 goals here: "Even me, I'm not 
used to them. Sometimes it's surprising to be playing against them and have to 
stop and think, 'oh, they're left-handed.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to coaches and players, lefties are most effective on offense in a 
six-on-five situation, when a penalty has left the defense short a player. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a man up, that's when you use him the most, because of 
positioning," Dettamanti said. "You pass along the outside, always moving the 
goalie and the defense around. Left-handers can catch and shoot the ball 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Said Corso: "Right-handers have to stop and shoot across their bodies. Lefties 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
And Clark has discovered that being left-handed has helped open the door to 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of break since I was young because I was left-handed," he said. 
"It's given me a lot of opportunities. Sportsmen aren't exactly encouraged to 
change (hands)." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, left-handers can add character to a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Left-handers are a little unorthodox, a little off, anyway," Dettamanti said. 
"In swimming, the breast-strokers are a little off. Left-handers are the same 
way."

BUTH READIES FOR COLLEGE WRESTLING BY ADDING POUNDS -- AND VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwayne Buth, the state high school wrestling champion at 161 pounds, recently 
went on a strict diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically try to eat everything in sight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
OK, sort of strict. Buth recently accepted a scholarship to Cal State 
Fullerton, and he knows that if he is to continue his wrestling success in 
college, he will have to add bulk and strength. 
</P>
<P>
He now weighs about 185, with most of the added pounds coming from a protein 
mixture that he drinks three to four times a day. His work in the weight room 
hasn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
Buth is not only trying to eat everything in sight; he is also trying to win 
everything in sight. To that end, he added to his state championship by taking 
the gold medal at 191 pounds Saturday in the California State Games at Serra 
High School. He was one of 12 area wrestlers to finish among the top four in 
their class. 
</P>
<P>
Buth's gold came after he won by a decision over Brian Tomazic of Santa Clara, 
4-0, in the title bout. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I needed that match for confidence to wrestle against bigger guys," 
Buth said. "I needed the work for when I go to Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
The only wrestler to pin Buth during the high school season, Shawn Diamond, 
also took home a gold medal and helped San Diego County earn second place as a 
team with 63 total points. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara topped the field with 77 points. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, who graduated from San Dieguito last spring, took first at 175 pounds 
(he wrestled at 161 in high school) by pinning his final-round opponent, John 
Sanchez of Santa Clara, after taking him down with a half-nelson less than two 
minutes into the match. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond is 6-feet-4, which is noteworthy because his height makes his 
half-nelson all the more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
"They (opponents) are a lot stronger than I am," Diamond said. "But for some 
moves, like my half-nelson, my height makes it hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond pinned three opponents in Saturday's tournament, all the result of 
half-nelsons. He pinned 32 opponents during the year, all with the same move. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Castillo 105 pounds) was the only other San Diego All-Star to strike 
gold. He won by decision against Mitch Guzman from San Joaquin Valley, 6-4, in 
his title match. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Reding (123) and David O'Leary (275) were San Diego's second-place 
wrestlers; Tony Matteucci (165), Dale Hanover (132) and Craig Threlfall (220) 
won third-place medals; and Matt McSweeney (154), Quincy Clark (165) and Erik 
Johnson (220) were fourth-place finishers. 
</P>
<P>
ROLLER SKATING 
</P>
<P>
The winner in the men's senior roller skating division, Jay Etheredge, 26, of 
Milpitas, says he regularly gets up to speeds in excess of 25 miles an hour. He 
can do 100-meter sprints -- around ovals -- in 9.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But don't make the mistake of asking Etheredge for his winning time. 
</P>
<P>
"Times are irrelevant," he'll tell you. "It's more of a cat-and-mouse type of 
race. It's just like cycling, or anything that has to do with drafting." 
</P>
<P>
Etheredge should know -- he has been the Southwest States champion in nine of 
the past 10 years, an accomplishment that goes rather unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Like the California Games themselves, speed skaters are fighting for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get our sport recognized by the Olympics and we feel this 
(skating in the California Games) is a step in that direction," said Ken 
Shelton, the event director. "It'll probably be a demonstration sport in the 
1996 Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Slam-N-Jam team has made it to the title game of the boys 
18-and-under tournament after handing Carson B-Ball a 79-75 defeat. Carson, 
however, will also be in the gold-medal game because it came back after losing 
to San Diego, defeating Team Avia, 79-73, to earn a spot in the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Today's game is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at Grossmont College.

YACHTING 
</P>
<P>
Dave Curtis of Marblehead, Mass., leads after the first race of the

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: INVESTOR SIMMONS MAY BE MAKING MOVE ON LOCKHEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What does Harold Simmons, the billionaire Texas investor, really have in mind 
for Lockheed Corp.? 
</P>
<P>
Simmons currently owns around $280 million worth of the Calabasas-based 
aerospace company's stock. But he has confused Wall Street over the past few 
months by selling some of his Lockheed holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lamb, president of Wealth Monitors Inc., a Kansas City, Mo., investment 
advisory firm, has been studying Simmons' moves and thinks that he has the guy 
figured out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Simmons wants to own and control Lockheed eventually," Lamb concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Then why has Simmons sold some of his Lockheed stock? 
</P>
<P>
Here, chronologically, is what Lamb thinks happened 
</P>
<P>
April 3: Simmons holds 5.3% of Lockheed's stock. At this point, Wall Street 
figures that the company -- although it has a market value of about $3 billion 
-- is vulnerable to a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
April 4: Lockheed announces a major restructuring that includes the 
establishment of an employee stock ownership plan and the sale of some assets. 
</P>
<P>
April 4: Simmons says he might sell some stock, and that same day unloads 
200,000 shares. That brings his total holdings down to 4.9% of Lockheed's 
shares (4.2% after his holdings are diluted by the establishment of the ESOP by 
Lockheed). Wall Street figures, at this point, that Simmons is being scared 
away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buys More Shares 
</P>
<P>
Lamb thinks that Simmons purposely wanted to get his holdings under 5% so that 
he wouldn't be required to publicly disclose to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission certain discussions about Lockheed. "Simmons at this point went into 
the shadows," Lamb says. 
</P>
<P>
May 15: Simmons meets with Lockheed's management. Nothing is known about the 
meeting because Simmons -- who at this point still owns less than 5% of 
Lockheed's shares -- isn't required to disclose what was discussed. "That same 
day, Simmons started buying for a solid month, except for one day, May 16," 
says Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Between May 15 and June 8, Lamb says Simmons bought $69 million worth of 
Lockheed stock. And from June 9 to July 17, he bought another $34 million worth 
of stock. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 1: Simmons reports that he purchased another 909,100 shares of Lockheed, 
bringing his total to 6,007,200, or 9.46%. 
</P>
<P>
"He now has $280 million in Lockheed, his biggest investment ever," says Lamb. 
"He wants to own this company. He's been sitting with $4 billion in borrowing 
power for two years." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb's view is unconventional. Most people on Wall Street still think that 
Lockheed is too big for Simmons to take over. And the government would be very 
reluctant to allow a corporate raider to bother an important defense contractor 
like Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Lockheed's stock has not reacted much to Simmons' buying 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed does have one thing that could make it vulnerable. The company has a 
very over-funded pension fund that could attract a corporate raider. 
</P>
<P>
If Lamb is right about Simmons action, he will have solved one of Wall Street 
biggest mysteries. Simmons, in the eyes of Wall Street, wouldn't be fickle. 
He'd be smart. 
</P>
<P>
The way that Wall Street sees it, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan 
is a little like the pilot of the jet that crashed in Iowa. His steering 
mechanism isn't functioning, so he has to speed up or slow down his engines to 
go in a straight line. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, of course, is controlling the economy. He gunned the interest rate 
engine early this year when it looked like inflation was getting out of hand. 
And now he's revving up the economy by lowering interest rates because he's 
worried about a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is, can Greenspan keep this baby flying? The financial markets 
apparently think that he can, or else bonds wouldn't have risen as much as they 
have this year and the stock market wouldn't be up 8% in July alone. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts think that the financial markets are playing with fire. Even 
if Greenspan can successfully keep the economy humming for a while at a most 
desirable moderate-growth, moderate-inflation pace, most experts agree that 
Greenspan has not found a cure to the common recession. And when that recession 
does come -- whether it is later this year, next year or the year after that -- 
the stock market will not like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recession Scare 
</P>
<P>
(In testimony last week, even Greenspan admitted that he won't know if he's 
avoided a recession until well into next year.) 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very curious. You are dealing with a study in mass psychology," says 
Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., referring to the 
stock market's recent ascent. "People are buying stocks because they are going 
up, rather than buying them in the expectation that earnings are going to 
improve. And that could be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Groveman and others worry that the more stocks go up, the more 
treacherous it will be when the markets start reacting to fears of a recession. 
Just how dangerous the recession scare can be was witnessed during the last 
week of June, when the Dow Jones industrial index fell a quick 92 points on 
worries that the economy was slowing too much. 
</P>
<P>
The markets were acting skittish again this past week, especially on Tuesday, 
when signs that the economy is continuing to slow began to reappear. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, thinks that the 
markets have been reacting correctly -- if they think that Greenspan has the 
magic touch and can execute the so-called "soft landing" for the economy. Since 
the Federal Reserve has been easing interest rates lately, Hoey thinks 
Greenspan may actually be able to avoid a recession in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Hoey thinks that a recession will start soon -- probably in the middle of 
1990. The Fed, he believes, is laying the groundwork right now by loosening 
interest rates. That move will cause an aggravation of inflation and the need 
for higher interest rates before next year's recession. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Straszheim, head economist at Merrill Lynch, sees things a little 
differently. He thinks that the recession is already starting and that the 
nation's gross national product will fall this quarter and next. 
</P>
<P>
But Straszheim also believes that the financial markets will ignore the 
recession. "I think the market will look right through the period of weakness," 
says Straszheim, focusing instead on the economic recovery he that predicts in 
early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
So place your bets. Will the economy go into that recession? And, can the 
financial markets really ignore the problems that businesses will have and 
continue to move higher? 
</P>
<P>
Three major drug companies have already agreed to be acquired in the past few 
months, and experts say more consolidations are likely in that industry. 
</P>
<P>
For the investor looking to make a killing from one of these upcoming 
takeovers, the only trick is to own stock in the company being acquired (which 
will go up) and not the one doing the acquiring (which, likely, will go down). 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts think Pfizer Inc., Rorer Group, Upjohn Co., Warner-Lambert 
Co. and Syntex Corp. are the most likely drug companies to be acquired. 
American Home Products, a drug company that is also involved in other business, 
could also be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
You would probably be wasting your time and money on Glaxo Holdings, Merck 
&amp; Co., Eli Lilly Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson or Hoffmann-LaRoche, the 
analysts say. These five will more likely be the ones doing the acquiring 
rather than be the companies bought. 
</P>
<P>
But analyst aren't even willing to concede that these five industry giants are 
safe. As David Saks of Wedbush Morgan Securities says, all the rules have 
already been broken regarding mergers in the drug industry, so "now any idea 
makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Further down the road, analysts say, biotechnology companies could come under 
attack. But the attractiveness of these biotech firms to drug or chemical 
companies will depend greatly on the biotech firm's ability to translate 
scientific discoveries into useable products. 
</P>
<P>
Smith Barney restricted its salespeople from buying Midway Airlines stock last 
week. A spokesman, however, wouldn't say whether it was because the brokerage 
firm was representing a corporate raider who might go after Midway, a 
Chicago-based airline. Midway's stock has been trading very heavily for more 
than a week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All those speculators waiting for Paramount Communications' next hostile 
takeover attempt had better make themselves comfortable. A Wall Street source 
familiar with Paramount says the company never had a contingency takeover 
target in the event -- as happened -- that it didn't get to acquire Time Inc. 
Paramount's chief executive, Martin Davis, moreover, would be reluctant to 
attempt another unfriendly takeover so soon, the source says. The source thinks 
that the next deal for Paramount will be a friendly one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is someone after Conrail? Last week, Conrail -- also known as Consolidated Rail 
Corp. -- established an employee stock ownership program. The week before that, 
the company raised its common stock dividend. Both are viewed by Wall Street as 
defensive measures against a takeover, confirming an earlier report in this 
column about the company's nervousness. But is someone really after the 
company, which is protected legislatively from takeovers until early next year, 
or is Conrail just paranoid? A source on Wall Street says Conrail spotted some 
suspicious buying of its stock a few months ago coming out of Chicago and 
thinks that someone may be accumulating its shares. . . .

ISRAEL'S BRILLIANT DISASTER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the late Moshe Dayan once said, "Israel has no foreign policy, only a 
defense policy." 
</P>
<P>
The Dayan dictum was confirmed by Israel's kidnaping of Sheik Abdel Karim 
Obeid. As a military operation it was brilliantly successful. In its impact on 
Israel's foreign relations it is a disaster. And I think the full scale of the 
disaster has not yet emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic response to the kidnaping -- announcement of the murder of U.S. 
Marine Corps Lt. Col. William R. Higgins -- has proved horribly effective, 
politically. A major objective of Israel's enemies is to drive a wedge between 
Israel and the United States. And it is now clear that American hostages 
provide the ideal hammer for wedge-driving. All you have to do is to have an 
American hostage; threaten to murder that hostage in response to some 
unbearable Israeli "provocation," and then murder him. Or, if you have already 
murdered him before the provocation took place, you can produce the proof of 
the murder after the provocation. Either way, you have produced an effective 
tap on that wedge. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of that was provided by Sen. Bob Dole, just after the announcement of the 
hanging of Higgins. The Dole statement in relation to Israel was the most 
scathing made against Israel by any American political leader since 1957. And 
1957 was far the worst year in the entire history of Israel-United States 
relations, up to now. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers think that Dole consulted President Bush before he made that 
statement, and that his reference to Israel reflects the feelings of the 
President as well as of the senator. If so, the government of Israel has cause 
to be seriously worried, as I believe it now is. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran and in Damascus, and at PLO headquarters, the strategists of the 
struggle against Israel will have studied the Dole statement with close 
attention. They will rightly interpret it as meaning there is marvelous 
political mileage to be made out of murdering American hostages and keeping a 
threat of murder suspended over other American hostages. A subtle variant is to 
appear occasionally in the role of "protector" of the hostages held by your 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
The atrocity against Higgins, committed by the enemies of Israel, might have 
enhanced American feelings of being "on the same side" as Israel, had the 
circumstances been different. But as it is, things don't seem quite to be 
working that way. The fact is that America does not appear to possess any 
effective mode of action against the captors of the hostages. The dispatch of 
U.S. warships to the eastern Mediterranean may perhaps impress a part of the 
American public. But it doesn't impress any of the armed factions of Lebanon. 
Those factions have seen American warships before. They have even seen American 
Marines. And they have seen the departure of the warships, and of the Marines, 
without their having accomplished anything whatever. 
</P>
<P>
It is true there are things that could be done that would hurt Iran -- a 
blockade of its oil exports, for example, but to do the things that would hurt 
Iran would be much more likely to result in more murders of American hostages 
than in their release. So that option is not worth much either. There may yet 
be some American military response to the hostage situation. But if there is, 
it is quite unlikely to do the hostages any good, whatever else it may do. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the American frustration at this specific incapacity of its enormous 
material strength is bound to vent itself on Israel, for having provided the 
incident that led to the demonstration of this incapacity and to death. But 
Israel is also the only country involved over which the United States has the 
capacity to exert serious pressure. That pressure can be effective if it is 
sufficiently motivated and sustained. I believe it is likely to be so, in time, 
in the case of Sheik Obeid. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that Israel is likely, under pressure from the United States, to 
release Obeid unconditionally, contrary to Israel's current intention. But I 
don't believe that release of the sheik will undo the damage done by his 
capture, and the responses to his capture. On the contrary, it is likely to 
compound that damage. Unconditional release of the sheik, in current 
circumstances, would provide certain proof that the holding of hostages on the 
threat to kill them -- a threat made credible by occasional killing -- are 
highly effective political weapons in the war against Israel. That lesson will 
not soon be forgotten. It is not conducive to a general release of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the sheik would no doubt nullify those threats against hostages 
that have been ostensibly based on the sheik's imprisonment, but other threats 
will follow, supposedly caused after other "provocations" by Israel. And Israel 
has really no choice but to continue to supply such provocations. It may well 
in future avoid such high level "spectaculars" as the kidnaping of the cleric, 
which had such untoward political results. But it has to defend itself against 
the guerrilla war waged against it by the Hezbollah and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
Every act of self-defense, on Israel's part, will be seen by the Hezbollah as a 
provocation. And the more successful any such act is, the more unbearable the 
provocation will be. That being so, the Hezbollah is likely to make repeated 
use of its not-so-secret weapon: the American hostages. The repercussions in 
America, in relation to Israel, seem likely to be similar to those reflected in 
the Dole statement, but getting progressively worse. 
</P>
<P>
Some well-meaning commentators have drawn from the whole affair the moral that 
it is urgent to get on with "the peace process," which is assumed capable of 
producing general harmony in the Middle East (so resulting in, among other good 
things, the release of all the hostages). The Bush Administration may well draw 
the same moral. It may well increasingly interpret "the peace process" in an 
Arab sense: meaning a Palestinian state in the territories currently occupied 
by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
If things develop that way, Israel will be placed in an appalling position. It 
will be under heavy pressure, from its sole and indispensable ally, to do 
things incompatible with its survival. To hand over the territories, to anyone, 
would mean a serious danger of civil war inside Israel. Jewish settlers in the 
territories, who are now numerous, would have to be uprooted by force. Many of 
them would put up armed resistance and would be supported by about half the 
population of Israel and of the defense forces. Israel's continued existence 
would be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
A "Palestinian state" would mean creation of a second Lebanon on Israel's 
borders. The Palestinian state, if and when it exists, is supposed to be 
administered by "the PLO." But the PLO is no more than a name for a number of 
diverse and conflicting factions; some would continue the armed struggle 
against Israel out of any territory that might be handed over, irrespective of 
any agreements that might be concluded in the name of "the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
So Israel, having handed over territory, at the cost of an agonizing internal 
crisis, would not get any peace in exchange. But the cost of rejecting 
"territory for peace" indefinitely and without a credible alternative might 
include loss of the American alliance. 
</P>
<P>
If Israel is to weather the storms that lie ahead, the Dayan dictum must cease 
to apply. Israel needs a foreign policy, as well as a defense policy -- and 
needs it urgently.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week was George Bush's toughest week so far as President. How did he do? 
</P>
<P>
He did about the same as every other President has done in a hostage crisis. 
The United States looked helpless. And the President of the United States 
looked ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
A hostage crisis doomed Jimmy Carter's presidency. Ronald Reagan made his worst 
decision as President -- selling arms to Iran -- because of his frustration 
over a hostage situation. 
</P>
<P>
A hostage crisis is the most frustrating problem a President can face. He is 
under immense pressure to do something. And there is little he can do. Our 
enormous military power is of no value when it comes to saving individual 
lives. That is exactly why terrorists find American hostages so valuable. With 
an American hostage, you can make the United States look helpless. And you can 
make the U.S. President look ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the pressure the President was under last week. A Republican 
congressman said, "It is time for the United States, without regard to what 
anybody else thinks, to go to the root of the evil in the Middle East. We need 
revenge, we need justice." 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic congressman saw things differently. "A great country like ours is 
helpless," he said. "The normal reaction would would be vengeful. But we need 
to know more about who the terrorists are, where they keep the hostages and how 
we can retaliate. We can't blow up Lebanon just to avenge the life of one 
American." 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans probably agree with both points of view. Do something. But don't 
do anything rash. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is haunted by several images in the current crisis. One is the image of 
Carter. Car- ter's deep moral convictions turned the Iranian hostage crisis 
into a personal and national obsession: "America Held Hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Another is the image of Reagan. Reagan's air of toughness and self-assurance 
made him look in control of events even when he wasn't. Everybody knew Reagan 
was perfectly capable of telling Beirut or Tehran, "We begin bombing in five 
minutes." It was a relief when he didn't. Reagan gained points for defying 
expectations and being cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is also haunted by his own image in the China crisis earlier this summer. 
Bush was cautious and sensible in his response to the Beijing government's 
murderous crackdown on the student protesters. His prudence was applauded by 
foreign-policy professionals and approved by the U.S. public. But it didn't 
help his image. 
</P>
<P>
Bush failed to give voice to the anger and indignation felt by the American 
people. He spent too much time justifying our relationship with China and not 
enough time condemning their brutality. Bush's policies in China were correct 
and professional. But they were also wimpy. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan might have done the same thing in China. But Reagan didn't have to prove 
anything. Bush does. We know he can beat up Michael S. Dukakis, but can he 
handle anybody tougher than that? 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bush has done pretty well as President by being a nice guy. He 
compromised with Congress and has been conciliatory toward our allies. He has 
promoted the idea of a "kinder, gentler" America. Fine. But now that he faces 
his first serious crisis, Bush is under pressure to say, "No more Mr. Nice 
Guy." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Jackie Mason does a devastating impression of Bush. He runs around in 
circles, muttering to himself, "Busy, busy, busy." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the President stands still, raises his finger and makes a 
pronouncement: "Noriega -- out!" He resumes rushing about, muttering, "Busy, 
busy, busy." Another sudden stop, another bold pronouncement: "Exxon -- clean 
it up!" That said, it's back to work, "Busy, busy, busy." Soon the President 
stops again, looks up and declares, "China -- shame on you!" Then he goes back 
to his dithering, "Busy, busy, busy." 
</P>
<P>
That's Bush all over. He is the busiest President in memory. But nothing keeps 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bush seemed trapped by the contradictions and uncertainties of the 
hostage situation. For one thing, the President was unable to make up his mind 
whether this was a crisis. Bush started out with a bad decision to treat the 
matter as a grave national crisis. When he saw that nothing could be done, he 
made matters worse by pretending there was no crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the President got the news that Shiite terrorists claimed to have 
executed Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, he canceled his trip to Las Vegas and 
rushed back to the White House, where he spent the day in emergency meetings 
with advisers and congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Then the President found out that we didn't know much and we couldn't do much. 
Bush discovered the same thing Carter and Reagan discovered -- if you take a 
hostage crisis too seriously, the United States government ends up being held 
hostage by the crisis. The terrorists control your agenda. 
</P>
<P>
So the next day, the Administration tried to downplay the issue. "We're 
probably looking at a long-haul situation here," a senior White House official 
said. Bush explained, "It's very hard when you're dealing with this kind of 
cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to get all the information you need to 
make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Many people were surprised when the President went ahead Tuesday night with a 
massive barbecue on the White House lawn for 500 members of Congress. Clearly 
the President wanted the barbecue to be a statement: This Administration would 
not be immobilized by the hostage situation. Only the President never made that 
statement. All he said was, "These are not easy days in Congress or the White 
House." So the whole event came off as a little callous. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration seemed to be in a state of confusion over a lot of other 
things as well. Is the United States prepared to take military action? Bush is 
painfully aware of the dilemmas posed by military retaliation. As vice 
president, he chaired the Reagan Administration task force on terrorism. The 
commission's report stated, "Our principles of justice will not permit random 
retaliation against groups or countries." 
</P>
<P>
The report went on to say "when perpetrators of terrorism can be identified or 
located, our policy is to act against terrorism without surrendering basic 
freedoms or endangering democratic values." That's hard in a place like Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the week, U.S. warships were steaming toward Lebanon and Iran. 
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater cautioned reporters, "I would not 
attach a great deal of significance" to these maneuvers. Just what message was 
Bush sending? 
</P>
<P>
The one thing no one could get straight was the Administration attitude toward 
Israel after its commandos seized Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid in Lebanon on July 
28. On Monday night, after the report of Higgins' murder, Bush issued a 
statement saying, "On Friday, I said that the taking of any hostages was not 
helpful to the Middle East peace process. The brutal and tragic events of today 
have underscored the validity of that statement." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Bush also issued "an urgent call to all -- all parties -- who 
hold hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith, as a humanitarian 
gesture." Was Israel one of those parties? The United States clearly did not 
want to be seen as pressuring Israel to negotiate with terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, when the Israelis heard that Higgins' life was being threatened, 
they offered to exchange Obeid and other Shiite prisoners for Israeli and 
Western hostages. The United States tacitly agreed to the Israeli offer. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is reported to have offered the following 
formulation: "Our policy is we do not negotiate with terrorists. Israel has a 
different policy. As a result of these various policies, the U.S. government 
can neither concur in, nor object to, such an Israeli proposal." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration insisted, however, that it did not hold Israel responsible. 
"None of our statements should be taken as a criticism of Israel," said one 
State Department official. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) expressed 
concern that the terrorists were succeeding in driving a wedge between the 
United States and Israel. Other commentators brought the argument full circle 
by claiming Israel should have known its actions ran the risk of driving that 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, it is difficult for the United States to do anything in 
a hostage crisis. We are limited by our values. To be sure, polls show that 
Americans endorse such principles as no negotiation with terrorists and 
military retaliation against governments that support terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans do not always adhere to these principles in real-life situations. 
At the time of the TWA hostage crisis in 1985, a CBS News poll revealed that, 
by about 5-3, Americans felt the U.S. government should be more concerned about 
the lives of the hostages than about its policy of never negotiating with 
terrorists. In an ABC News-Washington Post poll, people said the United States 
should negotiate for the release of the hostages "even if that means giving in 
to the terrorists' demands," rather than risk having some of the hostages 
injured or killed. So much for matters of principle. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for Americans to accept the argument that abstract concepts 
like the credibility of U.S. foreign policy and U.S. relations with Israel are 
more important than protecting innocent lives. Especially when the anguish of 
those innocent lives is dramatized on television. 
</P>
<P>
There seem to be three possible outcomes of the current crisis. One is the 
hostages will be released in a trade with Israel. In that case, Bush and the 
Israeli government will come off as heroes. Another possibility is that the 
terrorists will murder more hostages and the United States will be forced to 
retaliate. In that case, tensions between the United States and Israel will 
rise and the Middle East conflict will escalate. The most likely possibility is 
that the stalemate will continue and the crisis will fade from public 
consciousness. Remember the crisis over our insisting on the ouster of Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega in Panama? He's still there. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one thing Bush cannot do. That is control which of these outcomes 
actually occurs.

A PRIEST ON ABORTION: WOMAN AS THE PROPER MORAL AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George F. Regas, The Rev. George F. Regas is rector of All Saints Episcopal 
Church, Pasadena; this article is adapted from a July sermon. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few of us are neutral about abortion. Most Americans want abortion to be legal 
and safe. They respect the freedom of a woman to choose whether or not she is 
to bear a child. But most Americans are concerned that we not create an 
abortion culture, that abortion not become just another method of birth 
control. 
</P>
<P>
With 1.5 million abortions each year -- 4,000 a day -- the issue becomes a 
profoundly pastoral one for me. I know children who are now with us because in 
the honest and prayerful struggle with the question of abortion, their mothers 
-- some married, some single -- decided to carry a child to maturity and birth. 
They all have expressed profound gratitude that abortion was a legal and safe 
option. 
</P>
<P>
I know women whose lives were literally saved from unraveling emotionally and 
who were given a chance for healthy, mature living because legal, safe abortion 
was an available choice which they accepted. 
</P>
<P>
As the fierce debate on this unyielding dilemma breaks across the American 
landscape, I want to share some of my convictions and my doubts. We are bound 
together by a community of faith. There is space for struggle, for conflict, 
for exploration, for listening and for loving those who disagree with us. 
</P>
<P>
First, the legal issue. The Supreme Court's landmark ruling on Roe vs. Wade in 
1973 made abortion on demand legal in the early stages of pregnancy and gave 
states the right to protect the potential life of the fetus in later states of 
pregnancy -- or, as the court said, when the fetus is viable, capable of living 
outside the womb. The medical and scientific communities have consistently said 
a fetus is viable no earlier than 24 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then on July 3, 1989, a divided Supreme Court opened the way for states to 
limit a woman's access to abortion -- allowed states to place more and more 
limitations on abortion. This decision did, however, stop short of overturning 
the Roe vs. Wade ruling that made the practice of abortion legal in America. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the 1973 ruling, called the July 
3 decision ominous. He wrote, "I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty 
and equality of millions of women . . . ." He said a woman's fundamental right 
to choose abortion had survived but it wasn't secure. 
</P>
<P>
The July 3 ruling is an attempt to force abortion policy out of the courts and 
into the political arena -- into 50 state legislatures. Associate Justice 
Antonin Scalia wrote that abortion is "a political issue" more than a legal 
one. So from now on state legislators will grapple with ethical, medical and 
legal complexities that even the Supreme Court couldn't solve. Walter 
Dellinger, professor of law at Duke University, said, "Virtually all the power 
in legislatures is held by men who will never be affected by the restrictions 
they impose." Yet their conclusions will have a profound effect upon one of the 
most intimate decisions in a woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
There is a story of three professional people arguing about whose was the first 
profession on Earth. The argument involved a surgeon, an architect and a 
politician. The surgeon said, "I had to be first. The Bible says that out of 
the side of Adam, God took a rib and created Eve. That takes a competent 
surgeon." The architect said, "No, you are wrong. I had to be first because the 
Bible says that out of the chaos God created and fashioned this marvelous 
universe." The politician said, "Oh no. I was first. Who do you think created 
the chaos?" 
</P>
<P>
Politicians in the Missouri Legislature are saying: "The life of a human being 
begins at conception." They will require a test at 20 weeks to determine 
whether the fetus is viable, even with the medical community agreed that all 
evidence says a fetus isn't viable before 24 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This is playing to the anti-abortionist position that abortions are being done 
very late. Politicians have been convinced that late-term abortions are 
commonplace enough to warrant restrictive legislation. Some anti-abortion 
activists have cleverly created the myth that women have abortions right up to 
the time of delivery for frivolous reasons. The facts are clear and otherwise: 
90% of all abortions are done before the 13th week of pregnancy; fewer than 1% 
of all abortions occur after the 20th week -- and most of those are for urgent 
medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri is one of many states that restrict funding for most abortions -- 
leaving poor women and many young teenagers to scrape together enough money to 
terminate unwanted pregnancies. Only New York, California and a few other 
states provide funds for abortion. Now Missouri says no public facilities can 
be used. It hits the poor the hardest; the rate of abortion among women whose 
family annual income is at or below the poverty line is more than double the 
rate for women of the middle class and above. Some states also seek to ban 
abortions from all clinics and require a hospital setting. Now, more than 80% 
of abortions are safely and inexpensively performed in clinics. This hospital 
requirement would quadruple the cost to about $800 -- one more effort to make 
abortion less accessible, especially to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution guarantees a woman the right to exercise some control over her 
unique ability to bear children. The high court has now removed portions of 
that control. On the steps of the Supreme Court, Faye Wattleton, president of 
Planned Parenthood, asked rhetorically about these constitutional guarantees: 
"When did it become a political question whether women had reproduction 
rights?" The answer was easy: July 3, 1989. And yet as the late Associate 
Justice Robert H. Jackson said at mid-century, "One's right to life, liberty 
and property . . . depends on the outcome of no election." 
</P>
<P>
Whether pro-choice or anti- abortion, you do not have the right in this 
diverse, pluralistic society to force beliefs and opinions on others. There can 
never be a just law requiring uniformity of behavior on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
From my perspective that is what the Roman Catholic Church and the religious 
right attempt to do on abortion. The late Cardinal Cushing of Boston once said, 
referring to the birth-control controversy: "Catholics do not need the support 
of civil law to be faithful to their religious convictions, and they do not 
seek to impose by law their moral view on other members of society." May his 
spirit prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us have deep religious feelings about abortion, about the moral quality 
of the individual decision involved; but I believe it is critical to 
distinguish how I might judge the act of abortion morally and what I believe a 
societywide policy on abortion should be. Whatever my views, the woman must be 
the moral agent in that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The moral issue is the sanctity of life. The reason debate is so acrimonious is 
that both sides share the ethical principle of respect for life. But the 
sanctity of life doesn't end debate for we must deal with two sanctities -- 
fetus and mother. 
</P>
<P>
Let me state two extremes of the debate. Anti-abortion forces are declaring 
more and more that human personhood begins at conception -- then aborting a 
fetus is, to them, no more acceptable than any other form of murder. Randall 
Terry's group, Operation Rescue, met last month for a rally at the First 
Nazarene Church in Pasadena. Rescue members are committed to closing down 
abortion clinics. Terry, who has been arrested in city after city, continues to 
push his cause with increased vigor. He says, "We're calling on thousands of 
pro-life Americans to peacefully blockade these killing centers with their 
bodies to prevent children from dying, and we will launch an equal force 
against state legislatures to chip away at the Roe decision legalizing 
abortion." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, some pro-choice forces feel a fetus is a mass of 
dependent protoplasm to be extracted without regret. Abortion is merely the 
flushing away of a mass of tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Both extremes fall short. 
</P>
<P>
When does human life begin? When is there a living human person? That is not a 
biological fact to be discerned; it is a theological perception. To say the 
fetus is not alive, not a living reality, is absurd. From the moment of 
conception it is a growing life. But to say at the moment of conception there 
is a human person is equally absurd. 
</P>
<P>
I believe there is life at conception, life at a special time in its 
development -- part of a continuum that begins in the uterus, emerges as a 
human being at birth, passes through childhood, adolescence and adulthood and 
ends in death. The fertilized egg is human in origin and destiny. It is growing 
and has the potential of human personhood -- though it cannot be called a human 
person at that early moment. 
</P>
<P>
Such a distinction is basic even to conservative theologians like Dr. John R.W. 
Stott, who comments that the decision to abort for reasons of a mother's health 
involves a choice "between an actual human being and a potential human being." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion people want to erase all distinction between potential life and 
actual life. 
</P>
<P>
For many women, abortion is one of the most important decisions they ever make. 
Two ethical concerns about life are present: the sanctity of the potential 
human person and the sanctity of a mother's life -- her moral decision over her 
own body. She struggles with the quality of life she could offer the baby at 
birth, the impact of that birth on the existing web of her other 
responsibilities -- plus her own mental health and well-being. 
</P>
<P>
I am not pro-abortion -- but I am passionately pro-choice. I believe a woman is 
the proper moral agent to determine the use of her body; she should have the 
choice of carrying to maturity her pregnancy. As a theologian I see no way the 
moral status of a fetus can be of greater moral standing than a woman deciding 
her destiny. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question of individual conscience. I refuse to give over the moral 
issue of abortion to a church or the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1973, American women often chose to risk their own lives rather than 
have an extra child that could destroy the family's ability to cope or would 
cause an unmanageable crisis in family life. Some ghastly practices were used 
when surgical, safe abortions were not available. 
</P>
<P>
The radical nature of methods once resorted to speaks of the desperation 
involved in unwanted pregnancy. There is something vicious and violent about 
coercing a woman to carry to term an unwanted child. To force the unwanted on 
the unwilling, to use a woman's body against her will and choice, is a kind of 
legalized rape that is morally repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
The growing restrictions that state after state will place on abortion, in many 
instances recriminalizing it, will not reduce the instances of abortion. Women 
will continue to put their lives at risk to terminate unwanted pregnancy. New 
restrictions will only put poor women in a more desperate place and leave all 
women who have taken this risk more mentally scarred for life. I cannot believe 
such action reflects a moral society. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a way out? As a priest and as an ethicist, I want to be counted as 
pro-choice, keeping abortion legal, safe and available to all. But I seek a 
society in which abortion is less and less necessary, so count me among those 
who favor public policies that will reduce the number of abortions without 
coercing women. The only way that is possible is to create a different kind of 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek must have as its primary agenda the rights of the born, 
the improved quality of life for those who come into this marvelous world -- 
adequate care and protection from the first stirrings to the final groans. My 
grievance is severe with so many anti-abortion advocates who demand justice for 
the unborn but who also advocate dismantling social programs that provide a 
decent life for children once they enter the world. 
</P>
<P>
If we are to reduce abortions, we must reaffirm by work and action the rights 
of the born. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek doesn't flaunt and exploit sex at every turn. Vast 
numbers of adults today participate in the devaluing of human sexuality by 
separating sex from love and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek is one where greater scientific effort goes into 
developing safer and more reliable birth control, along with a commitment to 
have this contraceptive information and these contraceptives available to all 
people. Today 50% of all teen-agers are sexually active. I believe that reality 
is a very unhealthy phenomenon in our culture. Only 33% of teen-agers use any 
birth control method consistently; 25% of all abortions are among the teen-age 
population. Condoms prevent pregnancy and protect against the AIDS virus. It's 
immoral not to act with urgency in getting contraceptives to teenagers who are 
sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek says all life is sacred everywhere, for if it is cheap 
anywhere, it is cheap everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Only as we see every human being across this planet as a sacred person to be 
cherished -- only then will we see a society emerge in which abortion is less 
and less a necessary option. 
</P>
<P>
So with hearts that feel and brains that think, let us continue to walk as 
disciples of the Christ. And for me, at this moment in time, that means to join 
my life in solidarity with women who claim the moral responsibility over their 
own bodies. May God direct our efforts and illuminate our path. 
</P>
<P>
Amen.

PICKERING AT U.N.: A BLAND FACE OF U.S. POWER POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Reeve Pickering is an experienced hand at the practice of international 
power politics, a field at once ruthless and bureaucratic -- and still the big, 
balding, genial diplomat manages to keep a low profile. During the Reagan 
years, Pickering served as ambassador in two beleaguered satellites of the 
American empire: El Salvador and Israel. Now, as the U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, a post often held by the flamboyant, he breathes new life into 
the concept of blandness. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering's style seems to suit President George Bush and Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, both of whom fancy themselves international statesmen. 
Pickering will provide no sound-bite competition from his drab office on United 
Nations Plaza. Unlike some of his predecessors, Pickering is not ready to 
believe he is turning the tide of history or tempted to violate ridiculous 
diplomatic protocol. He is the second-ranking Foreign Service officer at the 
State Department and it shows. 
</P>
<P>
Does the appointment of a proved diplomatic operator to the ambassadorship 
indicate Bush's foreign policy will rely more on the United Nations? The most 
substantial sign that the Bush Administration takes the United Nations 
seriously was its quick decision to begin paying substantial portions of the 
U.S. contributions that have been in arrears for years. Pickering's appointment 
also suggests seriousness, if not originality. His forte seems to be 
unobtrusively knitting together U.S. clients under trying circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering, for example, arrived in El Salvador in fall of 1983, when the 
U.S.-backed government there was in serious trouble. In the countryside, 
left-wing guerrillas were gaining; in the city, government death squads, having 
slaughtered thousands of suspected leftists, were turning on moderate political 
figures who enjoyed close ties with the United States. Further congressional 
aid to El Savador was in doubt. Pickering's job was to hold the Salvadoran 
government together -- and for the most part he succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering played a leading role in arranging the December, 1983, visit of 
then-Vice President Bush to San Salvador. In a now-famous meeting, Bush 
presented the Salvadoran high command with a list of civilian and military 
death squad leaders. The Salvadorans removed a few of the most blatant and 
least-powerful killers from command positions; Congress was appeased. The 
Salvadoran government gained new legitimacy at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering was bold enough to recognize that the issue of death-squad violence 
had to be faced -- and realistic enough not to try any substantial remedy. 
Virtually all Salvadoran commanders, not just the four exiled officers, were in 
complicity concerning the murder of innocents. Pickering's diplomacy 
successfully de-escalated a reign of terror without losing the confidence of 
the government responsible for it. Whatever the morality of sustaining a 
terrorist army, Pickering's diplomacy was a considerable victory for U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1985, Pickering was rewarded with an equally sensitive job: ambassador 
to Israel. The U.S.-Israeli relationship is multifaceted, involving constant 
bureaucratic cooperation between Israel and the Defense Department, the Central 
Intelligence Agency, various arms salesmen, North American Jewish organizations 
and countless others. The ambassador's job is to keep track of all this and 
report back to senior U.S. policy-makers. It is one of the most demanding 
positions in the Foreign Service. It does not go to someone who made large 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering arrived in Tel Aviv just as the machinations of the Reagan 
Administration's secret arms-to-the-ayatollah deal began. In addition, Israel's 
coalition government was in constant turmoil, straining bilateral negotiations 
-- and the Palestinian intifada erupted during Pickering's tenure. Add the fact 
that the United States was inching toward recognizing the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization. There were, in other words, plenty of opportunities to 
misstep. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering barely raised a ripple. Two Middle East observers in Washington could 
not remember a single notable incident in Pickering's three years in Tel Aviv. 
The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv was slow to recognize the nature and importance of 
the intifada -- but then so was the Israeli government. The substance of 
Pickering's own reporting on the political situation in Israel is not known. It 
is a measure of his discretion, though, that he was asked to stay a year beyond 
the normal two-year ambassadorial rotation. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a less flattering interpretation of Pickering's clean 
record. Perhaps he was "out of the loop." As the Iran-Contra scandal 
demonstrated, the State Department did not play a central role in the 
foreign-policy-making process. The department is now one voice among many 
counseling the President. Operatives from the National Security Council and the 
CIA are institutionally powerful in areas once the exclusive province of 
diplomats. For example, when the NSC undertook its dealings with the Israeli 
prime minister in 1985-87, the missions were often entrusted to self-promoting 
NSC "consultant" Michael A. Ledeen -- not to Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say Pickering was in the dark. The voluminous documents of the 
Iran-Contra affair contain various references to Pickering at both the Middle 
East and Central American ends of the scandal. In early 1985, for instance, 
Pickering was informed that former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez was coming to El 
Salvador. Rodriguez went on to set up the illicit Contra-aid network. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Pickering sent representatives of a private Contra-aid group to 
meet Oliver L. North and that group later shipped material to the Contras. But 
Pickering told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he did not explicitly 
know that North was violating the Boland Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the arms-to-Iran deal, Pickering does seem to have been "out of the 
loop." He was, for example, on the participant list at a White House meeting 
where Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres was to discuss the matter. But a 
notation on the document suggests that Peres was unlikely to discuss the matter 
with anyone in the room. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering, in short, is not a leading player, but a kind of diplomatic sixth 
man. He is in the other tradition of U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations: 
the quiet listener who follows the big talker. Just as, for example, Donald F. 
McHenry succeeded Andrew Young, Pickering follows Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, an 
ostentatious intellectual, and then Vernon A. Walters, a bit defter diplomat 
than Kirkpatrick but also a longtime covert-action advocate. Pickering brings 
no such baggage to the United Nations. He travels lightly -- which is reason 
enough to watch him.

OFFSHORE DRILLING AND OIL TANKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("More Preventable Spills," June 27) on oil spills rightly 
emphasized prevention as the first line of defense against spills. However, you 
incorrectly suggested that oil companies are neglecting preventive measures in 
favor of spill containment. 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, we view prevention as critical in reducing pollution from 
tankers. The industry's new $250 million oil spill program places a heavy 
emphasis on avoiding tanker accidents through recommended changes in our own 
tanker operations and in government activities regarding tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Our proposals include a preventive step that you recommend: mandatory 
participation in the Coast Guard advisory vessel traffic systems and the 
possible expansion of these systems into ports and harbors that need them. We 
also are calling for study of alternative tanker designs such as double 
bottoms, double sides and smaller tanks for vessels by an independent body such 
as the National Academy of Sciences. We are proposing other preventive measures 
including requiring maneuvering assistance from tugboats where extraordinary 
navigation hazards exist, stricter pilot standards, better training for tanker 
personnel and drug and alcohol testing. 
</P>
<P>
The industry also is creating a new spill response organization for U.S. waters 
-- designed particularly for major spills but on call for any spill -- and it 
will fund $30 million to $35 million worth of research in prevention and 
cleanup over the next five years.

I cringe every time I see television footage of this disaster and shudder to 
think that this beautiful coastline may very well be damaged forever. That will 
most certainly be its fate if Exxon is allowed to "call it a day" in September. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon owes it to the environment, and to the nation as well, to live up to its 
promises of a complete cleanup. Exxon should be on the job until the last 
possible weather-permitting moment, and return in the spring to do more, much 
more, than merely "survey" the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan also knows who is responsible for full 
cleanup. Let's hope President Bush can see as clearly.

OFFSHORE DRILLING AND OIL TANKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to recent oil tanker disasters we seem to have several California 
legislators coming to the rescue of their constituency by advocating a 
comprehensive ban on offshore drilling and pre-lease activities. It is very 
vote productive to take such a stance, but being the extreme stance that it is 
it has many flaws and one major irony which is evidence that our rescuers 
haven't done their homework. 
</P>
<P>
Question: If we ban our domestic supplies how will we quench our thirst for 
petroleum products? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
Question: How will it get here? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Tankers, or to be accurate, more tankers. The weakest link in the 
petroleum chain. 
</P>
<P>
California is the third largest consumer of oil and gas in the world, just 
behind the Soviet Union and the rest of the U.S. But while everyone is jumping 
on the "ban offshore drilling" bandwagon, we are still jumping into our cars, 
boats, planes, etc. We eat food from all around the world but don't think of 
how it got here. We do all these oil consuming things but don't want to look 
offshore and see an oil platform. 
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration, drilling and production can be performed with environmental 
safety and must be. Leaps and bounds have been made in safety technology and 
oil industry technology in the past 20 years. We need to improve the tanker 
link. We don't need to put ourselves into a situation which equates to more 
tankers, i.e., a domestic ban. We need to be realistic.

A PIECE OF US GOES ON A VOYAGE OF WONDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY TAYLOR, Tony Taylor is a member of the technical staff guiding Voyager 
from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neptune. Almost 3 billion miles from Earth, it's a cold, impersonal place, a 
speck of a planet through even the largest telescope, but an enormous gas giant 
full of mysterious wonders when seen up close. 
</P>
<P>
In a little more than two weeks, we're going to experience it up close, you and 
I. We will see it through the eyes of a solar diplomat: a traveler, explorer, 
adventurer, and representative of the human race; a large metal-plastic-silicon 
representative named Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
When we arrive, what should we expect? The unexpected. That's the lesson 
learned from previous visits to unexplored planets. Are there rings at Neptune 
like those at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus? Possibly, but in incomplete arcs, 
unlike rings anywhere else. Are there other satellites, besides the known 
Triton and Nereid? Yes! Four others have already been discovered, and there's 
tantalizing evidence of more -- perhaps many more, maybe even clouds of them -- 
lurking just beneath the fuzz in the images painting the screens of video 
terminals at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In just days, now, they could rise 
to visibility above the electronic background noise. 
</P>
<P>
Neptune has its own internal heat source, and radiates more energy than it 
receives from the sun. Why? Is this what drives its turbulent atmosphere, 
generating the large spots already found? Soon, we may know. And Triton? We'll 
find whether it has an atmosphere, and whether we can see through to the 
surface. Will there be pools of liquid nitrogen, or will gases be frozen in 
slabs littering a desolate landscape of craters and mountains? Among the 
answers to the questions we know to ask will be the more questions we've not 
imagined -- again, the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
When Voyager arrives at Neptune on Aug. 24 it will be the first time that 
anything human-made has been to that planet. We should appreciate and celebrate 
the event, since it will also likely be the last time it will happen during our 
lives. That's because an arrangement of the solar system that occurs only about 
every 175 years was required to allow Voyager to make the trip in "only" twelve 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It had to go by Jupiter first, making a hard left turn in that planet's gravity 
to pick up energy in a crack-the-whip fashion to go on to the next planet. That 
was Saturn, which turned it left again, gave it more energy and pointed it 
towards Uranus. At Uranus, in 1986, it picked up still more energy and made 
course for Neptune. Since then it has been cruising at 10 miles per second 
toward Neptune. At Neptune, it will skim over the north pole, 3,000 miles above 
the atmosphere, turn so that it's headed south out of the solar system and make 
a final encounter with Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, before beginning a 
larger interstellar voyage. 
</P>
<P>
The science at Neptune is important but think also about the voyage, the 
adventure. Knowledge is good for the human mind, but travel is food for the 
psyche. And Voyager's travels have been and will be prodigious. It has been on 
its way from Earth since 1977, wending a crooked path through the outer solar 
system. Now, in a handful of days, it makes its final rendezvous, a close brush 
and embrace with Neptune, before flying out of the solar system to begin an 
odyssey through the Milky Way galaxy; an unattended, lonely voyage that may 
last from millions to billions of years. 
</P>
<P>
Towards the beginning of that longer journey, a mere few hundred thousand years 
in the future, our sun will have become a faint, uninteresting star in 
Voyager's eternally night sky. But no one will be with the spacecraft to 
appreciate that fact, and our ambassador will be slowly tumbling -- sightless, 
senseless, and alone -- in an immensely empty void. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow engineer on our navigation team claims that the spacecraft will 
actually be on display in the Smithsonian Museums 200 years from now. He thinks 
that by then we'll have both the technology and wherewithal to go out, find and 
catch Voyager, and bring it back. I'd like to think we would be able to do 
that, but if I'm still around I'll vote to leave it alone. 
</P>
<P>
There's something wonderful about the thought that a piece of ourselves is 
somewhere out there on a winding journey between the stars on its way to 
eternity. It's like having immortal children. 
</P>
<P>
There are hazards ahead -- for example, unseen ring particles orbiting Neptune 
could smack into us, prematurely ending Voyager's life -- but we'll probably 
make it through to see the wonders of Neptune and Triton. Then will begin the 
grander voyage -- the one that requires us to be romantics instead of realists, 
dreamers rather than schemers: 
</P>
<P>
Even though Voyager will go blind and deaf after a few tens of years; even 
though it will die an electronic death, it will still have the germ of human 
creativity and daring incorporated into its very structure. 
</P>
<P>
It will carry two messages -- an explicit one in the form of a golden record, 
and an implicit one stated by its profoundly improbable existence. And both 
messages will say to the finder, in essence, "I am from the planet Earth. I am 
of the human race. We are small and insignificant, but our souls are large 
because we have set out on a journey to know the universe."

WISDOM LIES IN THE OUTCOME, SO CLOSE RANKS ON TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBA EBAN, Abba Eban is a former foreign minister of Israel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Releasing Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid without any reciprocal liberation of Israeli 
and Western prisoners and hostages would be a formidable victory for terrorism. 
Those who advocate this course evoke understandable sympathy when they speak in 
the name of their personal kinship with hostages. But those who are charged 
with concern for international civility and public interest should look a few 
moves ahead, before suggesting action that would weaken the anti-terrorist 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
International terrorism takes its victims and opponents into a world of 
difficult choices. There are no easy ways. The terrorist enemy has his hand on 
the throat of humane mankind and is not constrained by any of the compassions 
that cause tremors of uncertainty on the civilized side of the barricade. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two solution. One of them is to snatch the endangered victims 
from the clutches of their captors by physical force. There have been occasions 
on which this approach has succeeded, as it did in Entebbe. In other instances 
it has been tried with heavy price as at Maalot in 1974 (when many Israeli 
children were killed by terrorists during an attempt by Israeli forces to 
rescue them by military action). Sometimes there has been tragic failure, as in 
Munich in 1972 when German assault forces tried unsuccessfully to liberate the 
Israeli Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
On most occasions, hostages are inaccessible to military rescue. In such 
contingencies there are only two possible courses. One of them, practiced by 
the United States, is to stand fast and let matters take their course. This 
involves a rigorous subordination of individual interest to an overriding 
principle. Israel does not go as far as this. When there is no possibility of 
forcible extrication, we have not excluded negotiated exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
But negotiation implies deterrence and incentive. Efforts by Israel and the 
Western powers to secure the release of prisoners and hostages from Shiite 
groups in Lebanon have been made fruitlessly over several years. The capture of 
Sheik Obeid, an active and enthusiastic terrorist, was designed to create an 
incentive for the Shiite movement to enter the bargaining context. There was 
certainly no such incentive before. 
</P>
<P>
The capture itself is not eccentric, nor is it an Israeli copyright. The United 
States bombed Libya with British cooperation, forced down an Egyptian aircraft 
carrying the hijackers of the ship Achilles Lauro and intercepted the terrorist 
Fawaz Younis on the high seas in order to bring him to trial in the United 
States. The bombing of Libya had graver human effects in terms of American and 
other lives than the temporary removal of Sheik Obeid from his home, but there 
were no senatorial cries of anguish then or since. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to avoid a unilateral capitulation to a terrorist leader is quite 
independent of any particular judgment on the original decision to capture him. 
The problem is how to emerge from the dilemma, not how to hold premature 
inquiries on how it arose. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who have known the anguish of participating in decisions on 
anti-terrorist resistance have learned that a "wise" decision is simply one 
that turned out well in the end. The judgments of historians depend on 
consequence, not on intention, and the media now take the historian's role. In 
these terms, a split second of reaction by Ugandan forces would have convicted 
the Entebbe decision of "rashness" and a little luck in Tehran would have 
crowned President Jimmy Carter as a champion of anti-terrorist "efficiency". 
</P>
<P>
Under these conditions of incalculability, there is only one rational course. 
It is for the defenders of civility in the free and rational world to close 
their ranks and maintain their solidarity, in all conditions and despite all 
vicissitudes, in success or in adversity. The lines are drawn between the 
perpetrators of terrorism and their opponents, not within the anti-terrorist 
family itself.

RENEWAL OF JAPANESE POLITICS NEEDS SHIFTS INSIDE PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE MOCHIZUKI, Mike Mochizuki is on the faculty of the School of 
International Relations at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By voting against the Liberal Democratic Party in the recent upper house 
election, Japanese citizens confirmed that their nation is in fact a democracy. 
Whether or not this LDP defeat will lead to a transformation of the political 
system will depend on how political leaders act in the next several months. At 
least three scenarios are possible. 
</P>
<P>
One outcome is a fundamental realignment of party politics. For this to happen, 
the Japan Socialist Party will need to change. Takako Doi's party made 
impressive electoral gains by riding a wave of popular dissatisfaction with the 
Liberal Democrats and by mobilizing the support of women. To consolidate this 
support, Doi will have to demonstrate that her party is capable of governing. 
This would involve modifying its foreign-policy position of unarmed neutrality 
and recognizing the U.S.-Japanese alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Socialist Party will also have to shed its Marxist doctrines and 
develop a more realistic approach to public-policy issues. While abolishing the 
consumption tax may be popular now, the party will have to develop a sensible 
tax reform plan that will cover the growing costs of social programs. 
Similarly, the party will have to go beyond simply opposing agricultural 
liberalization and develop its own strategy for dealing with the nation's trade 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
These steps will be critical in forging a workable coalition with the centrist 
Democratic Socialist Party and Komeito, the Clean Government Party, whose 
cooperation will be necessary if the Socialists want to assume power. 
</P>
<P>
Although skeptics will question the JSP's ability to transform itself, the 
historic opening posed by the Liberal Democrats' recent setback could compel 
the Socialists to make the change. Doi's statements after the election indicate 
a flexible posture and a keen awareness of the task at hand. Her personal role 
in the party victory should increase her leverage against ideological die-hards 
within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Rengo, the national federation of private-sector labor unions, 
will facilitate the process of Socialist transformation. It succeeded in 
electing 11 of the 12 candidates it fielded. The federation was formed in 1987 
to overcome the fragmentation of the labor movement and to give workers a 
greater voice in the policy process. This fall Rengo plans to unite with the 
unions representing public employees. Its leadership is committed to bringing 
the opposition parties together to form a united progressive force. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Liberal Democratic Party has lost its majority in the upper house, 
a united opposition would force the party to dissolve the more powerful lower 
house later this year and hand the conservatives another electoral defeat. That 
would give birth to Japan's first social democratic government since the late 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Another scenario is that the Socialists miss the current opportunity and the 
Liberal Democrats respond imaginatively instead. If the Socialists fail to 
change, the public will view them as irresponsible and unrealistic, and the 
current boom will soon fade. This would give the Liberal Democrats a chance to 
revitalize the party by putting forth an attractive leadership, by moving 
decisively on political reform and by adopting policies to distribute more 
widely and equitably the fruits of economic success. The probable selection of 
Toshiki Kaifu as party president and prime minister indicates that the Liberal 
Democrats are already moving in this direction. A reinvigorated LDP would then 
be able to sustain its control over the lower house during the next election. 
</P>
<P>
Such a revival, however, would still mean that the Liberal Democrats would not 
recover a majority in the upper house for at least six years. Consequently, the 
party will have to work with the opposition. This may involve bringing one or 
more of the centrist parties into a coalition government or working with them 
in guiding legislation through the Diet. The Liberal Democrats already have had 
some experience with this. During the 1970s, a razor-thin majority in the Diet 
forced the LDP to cooperate with the opposition parties in getting the budget 
and major bills passed. And from 1983 to 1986, the party formed a coalition 
with the New Liberal Club. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the possibility that neither the left nor the right will 
respond decisively and Japan will become plagued by weak and unstable 
governments. Although this scenario cannot be ruled out, it is the least likely 
to happen. Ideological polarization has declined over the years, and social 
conflict is well within manageable bounds. The dynamism of the economy makes 
the task of political restructuring easier. At the same time, the challenges 
posed by the international environment are acute enough to persuade Japan's 
political leaders of the need to overcome the current crisis as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
What are the implications for U.S.-Japanese relations? While the concerns of 
American officials are understandable, the fluidity in Japanese politics could 
ultimately strengthen the trans-Pacific alliance. A government led by either a 
transformed Japan Socialist Party or a revitalized Liberal Democratic Party 
will be more supportive of consumer and worker interests. This will help 
alleviate bilateral economic tensions by restraining Japan's export drive and 
by making less salient the issue of agricultural liberalization.

ON VIEW: A TOAST TO A WORLDLY MAN AND HIS DEEDS

Victor Carter has been president of the United Way and the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles. He's also been honored by three nations: the 
Third Order of the Imperial Treasury from Emperor Hirohito of Japan, a special 
award from Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and the Prime Minister's Gold 
Medal from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, he and his wife, Adrea, will be honorees at the inaugural Benefactors' 
Ball of the American Friends of Tel Aviv University at the Century Plaza. 
Carter is former national president of the Friends and former chairman of the 
organization's international board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
SUCCESS: When is success really success? When the chairmen feel that inner 
glow. The glows were radiating at the Vista del Mar Associates' Dinner alfresco 
and "The Phantom of the Opera." "We have a half million in sales, a net of 
$350,000 for sure," associates president Margot Bamberger said. 
</P>
<P>
What amazed her and event co-chairwomen Suzanne Sidy and Betty Sigoloff was 
that the $500 seats outsold the $200 and $300 ones, and that, of course, 
presented a hefty seating problem for Lois Harwin and Peekie Schaefer. At 
dinner, in fact, it was "committee-hold-back." Suzanne Sidy graciously went 
without dinner, which was served on the Music Center plaza under colorful 
banner swirls. 
</P>
<P>
Arline and Henry Gluck brought their daughter, Tracey. Sue and Martin Kozberg 
were accompanied by their newlywed daughter, Nancy Paul Sadwick, and her 
husband, David Sadwick. Vista del Mar and Reiss Davis medical director Lionel 
Margolin and his wife, Andrea, director of Reiss Davis, touched bases with 
chief executive officer Jerry Zaslaw. And Ann Gottschalk, former Associates 
president (as was her late mother, Helen Fels), reminded that the Associates 
group is 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATION: Two hundred of the Music Center's most loyal -- those volunteers 
most instrumental in the success of "Campaign '89" -- will be treated to a big 
thank you Wednesday. They'll dine and then see "Phantom of the Opera." Prime 
tributes go to campaign chairman William A. Carter, Music Center chairman J. J. 
Pinola, campaign vice-chairmen John E. Bryson and Roger A. Kozberg; Music 
Center president Esther Wachtell; board of governors members John F. 
Grundhofer, James P. Miscoll, Nancy Olson Livingston, Maurice J. DeWald, who 
helped meet the $14 million goal -- with kindness from 25,000 donors. 
</P>
<P>
WALKING SMART: Picture charity and fashion together: London designer Zandra 
Rhodes will paint Beverly Hills hot pink and Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell Salter 
will bestow a proclamation upon Friends of ChildHelp when the sassy couturiere 
premieres her oils and watercolors on Oct. 26. Beverly Hills dynamo Ellen 
Byrens worked out the details in London recently and expects a huge crowd at 
Dyansen Gallery on Rodeo Drive . . . 
</P>
<P>
SHARE (Share Happily and Reap Endlessly) officers and directors will be guests 
of I. Magnin Tuesday afternoon for the champagne reception and fall preview 
honoring designer Vicky Tiel. Pam Korman is new chair of SHARE, Joan Kardashian 
president and Jane Greer Lasker secretary. They'll be joined by new board 
members Joanna Carson, Roni Sue Malin and Shirley Turteltaub -- all most 
certainly planning to keep up the good record -- a gift of $1 million recently 
to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for the SHARE Disability Center . . . 
</P>
<P>
And Bullock's Westwood and Wings of ChildHelp USA are a duo staging a champagne 
breakfast and fall fashion festival Aug. 20, say Norma Kaz and president Pat 
Kirianoff. 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL WINDS: Penny and Julian von Kalinowski and their crowd paid respects at 
Wimbledon, had a private visit to the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, 
lunched with Sir Edward and Lady Tomkins at Winslow Hall and took in the Royal 
Regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Penny touches ground in time to chair the Los Angeles Master Chorale's first 
sing at downtown's new hostelry, Checkers, and to lend a hostess hand to the 
British American Chamber of Commerce do -- both in September. . . .

A Hancock Park quartet -- Barbara Washburn, Patte Barham and Boyne and Connie 
Crocker -- were with their USC classmate Madame Rene Bondoux (nee Virginia 
Mitchell) at her chateau near Paris for the French bicentennial.

RED LETTERS: Those Metropolitan Associates are at it with their summer film 
festival. The format: sit on a blanket, rub on insect repellent, picnic, watch 
an oldie movie. Kittie and Bill Ballard and Alice and Joe Coulombe host 
Saturday, Olive and Alex Varga and Doris and Norm Newell on Aug. 26. Earlier, 
Joan and Jim Caillouette and Hildegard and Michael Lindsay welcomed the film 
devotees. . . .

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: DOLPHINS: UNWITTING LURE FOR INDUSTRIAL FISHERMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Along rivers throughout the South American rain forest, the rare pink 
freshwater dolphin has traditionally been considered magical, capable of 
changing at will into human form to seduce people into amorous adventures. 
Supposedly helpless to resist the charms of the supple dolphin come-to-land, 
men and women sometimes explain away romantic infidelities with a wry, "The 
dolphin made me do it." 
</P>
<P>
It is easy for us to admire dolphins because they are sleek, lustrous, keenly 
intelligent. Whether it was this affinity that gave birth to the popular lore 
of transformation, no one knows. But clearly the legend brings the animals 
esteem -- in this region that celebrates their mythical properties, they are 
rarely hunted. 
</P>
<P>
However, dolphins are used to locate schools of fish, especially in the dry 
season when receding water levels in the river pack fish tightly together. A 
fisherman watches from a high tree near shore, and when he spots dolphins 
arching through the water surface, he signals other fishermen waiting below in 
canoes. These fishermen paddle madly into the river and toss a ring of netting 
into the splashing waters, hoping to snare some of the fish on which the 
dolphins have been feeding. Any dolphins caught in the nets are gently released 
by the fishermen, who show the care of a parent attending a sick child. 
</P>
<P>
On this small scale -- one boat, a handful of men and a subsistence level of 
fishing -- dolphins escape a premature death. But not when the scene changes to 
industrial tuna fishing in the warm Pacific. For years, we have been wrestling 
with the grisly problem of yellowfin tuna fleets that kill ocean-going dolphins 
by inadvertently catching them in purse-seine nets. Official U.S. statistics 
estimate that nearly 2 million dolphins were killed by fishing fleets in these 
waters between 1972 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that are still unclear, various species of salt-water dolphins 
travel with schools of yellowfin (light) tuna. Taking advantage of this 
association, fleets use dolphins as living sonar to locate tuna swimming well 
below the surface. Once sighted, the tuna -- and thus the dolphins -- are 
herded together, sometimes by the use of explosives. Then the fishermen toss 
their nets, tightening them in a circle to trap the tuna and, sadly, many 
dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins that are not maimed by the explosions can easily drown if they are not 
quickly freed to reach the surface, because they are air-breathing mammals. 
</P>
<P>
The worldwide killing of dolphins in this process gave impetus to passage in 
the United States of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the MMPA -- which regulated all ships flying a U.S. flag as well as 
all ships in U.S. waters -- intended to reduce the "incidental kill or 
incidental serious injury of marine mammals permitted in the course of 
commercial fishing operations . . . to insignificant levels approaching a zero 
mortality and serious injury rate." But in the intervening years, lobbying by 
the tuna industry, combined with changing political priorities in the United 
States, weakened the MMPA. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the tuna industry began to rely more heavily on ships 
flying other national flags. I've seen such ships at work in Mexico, Panama and 
Costa Rica. When the MMPA was re-authorized in 1988, it at least required that 
by 1990 any ship exporting tuna to the United States limit its rate of dolphin 
killed per ton of tuna fished. 
</P>
<P>
The tuna industry says it is doing everything possible to prevent dolphin 
kills, but this claim cannot be verified. Indeed, new techniques were 
introduced in the 1970s that had begun to reduce dolphin casualties, and the 
re-authorized MMPA calls for placing observers aboard all U.S.-flagged boats, 
as well as other controls, such as a ban on setting nets after sundown, which 
is when much dolphin mortality takes place. Foreign fleets must implement a 
"comparable" program of controls. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists remain unsatisfied with the situation, however, and are 
calling for a boycott of canned tuna -- even albacore and bonito that are not 
involved in dolphin deaths. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that very few fishermen in any country have a desire to slaughter 
dolphins. And the fishing industry remains the key player in forging any 
satisfactory solution. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins do not feed on yellowfin tuna, and yet the two are drawn together in a 
mysterious relationship that may influence their mutual survival. Perhaps only 
respect for the dolphin -- etched in the myth of the South American rain forest 
-- will stop us from turning this positive association into a deadly trap.

TAKE MY WORD: FALLEN WITHIN PERIMETERS OF EASY GRASP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MIDDLETON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She is more to be pitied than censured; / She is more to be helped than 
despised; / She is only a lassie who ventured / Down life's thorny path 
ill-advised. / Do not scorn her with words harsh and bitter; / Do not laugh at 
her shame and downfall. / For a moment, just stop and consider / That a man was 
the cause of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 I recalled that melodramatic old song while contemplating the pathetic picture 
of an innocent -- indeed, an immaculate -- word taken from sublime heights to a 
state of tattered ignominy among hoi polloi, simply by being embraced by 
ignorant lovers. Recently, I mentioned the word parameter, which has been 
misused to death in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
I said that, strictly speaking, parameter is an expression from 
crystallography, about which I know nothing. The first parameter definition in 
my WNI III (Webster's New International, Third Edition) tells me that it is 
"the relative intercept made by a plane on a crystallographic axis, the ratio 
of the intercepts determining the position of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
I feel sure that there are many thousands of perfectly sane people who know 
exactly what that means, but I'm not one of them. The second definition is from 
mathematics, about which I know so little that I couldn't even begin to ask 
intelligent questions regarding what I don't know. I think my last brush with 
mathematics -- not counting check books, taxes, and what-do-I-tip-on-this-tab 
-- was in high school algebra, circa 1942. The mathematical definition of 
parameter begins, "an arbitrary constant characterizing by each of its 
particular values some particular member of a system . . . " and I'm already 
way over my head. The succeeding definitions in WNI III are no more 
enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
My WNI III was published in 1966. It must have been sometime after that, 
probably during the Nixon years, when an anonymous member of the booboisie 
discovered parameter, thought it was a nifty, high-class, state-of-the-art way 
to say perimeter, and took the word to dinner parties, to bed, and introduced 
it to all his friends, happily misusing it for his own pleasure and the 
titillation of his social circle. Its misuse achieved almost instant popularity 
and was accepted with overwhelming enthusiasm. It started appearing on talk 
shows and in political discourse, showing up in phrases like "the parameters of 
our current options," where it was completely out of place. Obviously, a lot of 
people who hadn't a clue as to its meaning thought it impressive enough to 
display in public no matter what it meant. Anyway, it sounded a lot like 
perimeter, which we had all met in plane geometry in junior high. 
</P>
<P>
In my column, I implied that parameter had been stripped of its "legitimate" 
meaning, forgetting momentarily that language changes fairly constantly, so 
that illegitimate meanings often achieve legitimacy rather quickly, and that 
misuse through ignorance is one of the most common causes of change. It is the 
job of lexicographers to record the current usage of words and to reach a 
consensus on what the new meanings are. 
</P>
<P>
I got some mail on that column. I'd have welcomed mail from crystallographers 
or mathematicians who might have enlightened me, brushing away the shadows from 
my benighted state of not-knowing. Alas, my mail was entirely from people who 
missed my point. Not their fault, of course. What they had done was to go to 
their dictionaries and look up parameter. A perfectly sensible move. They found 
references to such notions as "a characteristic element or constant factor," 
"limit," and "boundary," none of which had any currency in 1966. I'll bet my 
entire Swiss bank account that their dictionaries were all published during the 
1970s or, more likely, the '80s. I turned to my most recently published 
dictionary -- The American Heritage, Second College Edition (1982). 
</P>
<P>
What I love about American Heritage is that it not only gives us the current 
definitions of words; it lets us have a peek at the seamy side of their 
history. Under parameter, it says, "Usage: This scientific term has been 
adapted to general usage. It is sometimes used in the sense of 'a constant, a 
given, or a precondition' and sometimes in the sense of 'a limit or boundary' 
(perhaps influenced by perimeter): We must stay within the parameters of the 
present budget. They want to narrow the parameters of public debate. Violence 
and rebellion are parameters of modern life. None of these examples is 
acceptable to a majority of the Usage Panel." 
</P>
<P>
So this extraordinary word that had known only the lofty realms of 
crystallography and higher mathematics, where ignoramuses like me would be 
hopelessly lost, was, through no fault of its own, brought down to a tattered 
existence in the pedestrian world of common colloquy. Not only that; it is 
unacceptable to a majority of the Usage Panel. Crystallographers and 
mathematicians probably still use parameter in its original sense, but I 
suspect that they have some sense of regret, knowing that it has been sullied. 
I think, though, that it is more to be pitied than censured.

REVIVING SOME LOVING MEMORIES OF PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is to thank Dave Larsen for the timeless article about grown-ups' sorrow 
on the loss of their parents ("The Sorrow of a Grown-Up Goodby," July 30). 
</P>
<P>
My father passed away when I was 3 and my mother in 1974, just one year after I 
had graduated from USC Engineering School. Yet, just a few days ago I had a 
wonderful dream that my mother was helping me get through college. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure I would not have gone through engineering school without my mother's 
moral support, especially since I was the only female in my class. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I do a good job or complete a big or difficult project, I dream my 
mother is still alive; sometimes I dream about my father also. 
</P>
<P>
Who would want to forget such wonderful parents?

Murray Yaeger, who operates a B&amp;B in Kennebunkport, Me. (the summer home of 
President Bush), complains that business is poor due to publicity surrounding 
the President. Yaeger says: "A great many other inns and businesses are 
suffering because vacationers believe the town is crowded with tourists and 
it's just the opposite. On a recent holiday weekend we filled only one room out 
of seven for the entire three-day period. This is not a unique situation. As I 
drove around Kennebunkport I saw vacancy signs everywhere -- large and small 
inns. It was, in fact, the most quiet weekend any of us can ever remember. With 
all the media talk about crowds and lack of available rooms, we are trying 
desperately to get the message out that we have rooms in our town this summer."

SAN FRANCISCO'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH 'PAINTED LADIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL BARRINGTON, Barrington is a Houston free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the 48,000 structures built during the glory years of Victorian architecture 
(1850-1915) in this city, about 8,000 survive with their historic facades 
intact -- "painted ladies" rejuvenated into classy homes, hotels, restaurants, 
offices and shops. 
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that an equal number await discovery and restoration, 
their antique charms hidden by face lifts performed in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is said to have the largest collection of Victorian architecture 
anywhere, despite the fact that the heart of the city's Victorian collection, 
514 downtown blocks, was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that conflagration stopped at Van Ness Avenue, and the older 
neighborhoods that lie west and south of Van Ness -- Pacific Heights, the 
Western Addition, and the Mission and Haight Ashbury districts -- still contain 
a heavy concentration of Victoriana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Styles 
</P>
<P>
Many styles are represented, but four -- Italianate, Stick, Stick/East-lake and 
Queen Anne -- are abundant. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth distinctive San Francisco style evolved around the turn of the century 
-- an ornate, more-is-better blend of these four designs. 
</P>
<P>
Italianate (1850-1870) is the most severe, with narrow windows, slim or 
Corinthian pillars at the front door, a flat roof (sometimes hidden behind a 
false front) and the simplest of bay windows. 
</P>
<P>
The Stick style literally added sticks of wood framing to the doors and windows 
of a basic Italianate facade. 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the Stick/Eastlake gingerbread of the 1880s, then the 
turrets and towers of the more romantic Queen Anne style in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is easy to find, with its sections of shingle siding in multiple 
designs, steep and often multigabled roof and large front porch. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Victorian buildings stayed in good condition because they were 
built of Mendocino redwood, which is extremely resistant to termites, rot and 
foggy weather. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flamboyant Colors 
</P>
<P>
The original Victorian owners often painted their highly detailed homes in 
flamboyant colors. Then came more conventional pastel years as changing tastes, 
the Depression, the Art Deco period, two world wars and urban renewal took 
heavy tolls. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Victorian legacy might have disappeared if it were not for the 
flower children and counter-culture who took over the Haight-Ashbury district 
in the 1960s. They began painting wild colors on the creaking old homes they 
occupied, and in doing so outraged the conservative city. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, one by one, Victorians with imaginative and highly detailed paint jobs 
began sprouting in respectable neighborhoods, and their value began to 
escalate. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Elberg, president of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan of San Rafael, said 
a San Francisco Victorian worth $20,000 in 1970, modernized and up to code, 
today sells for about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
A handsome Queen Anne tower house, circa 1892, may sport chrome yellow paint 
with electric blue trim, while its more dignified Italianate neighbor may have 
lavender siding, detailed in mustard and cream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purple Bay Windows 
</P>
<P>
The next block may have a shocking pink charmer with purple bay windows and 
lacy curtains, or a golden hunk of gingerbread, its carved panels highlighted 
in rich brown and orange. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area only the massive brick warehouses of Jackson Square 
survived the 1906 disaster. They house many of the city's finest antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
Union Street in Pacific Heights, specifically the six Victorian-lined blocks 
between Steiner and Gough streets, is one of the hottest shopping and 
residential districts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
This was originally a rural agricultural area first known as Golden Gate Valley 
and later as Cow Hollow. 
</P>
<P>
About 1870 a farmer named James Cudworth built a three-story house at what is 
now 2040 Union St. It houses six shops and a restaurant, and his barn at 2044 
Union is an antique shop. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss what was a modest stable at 1855 Union, built in 1884, or the twin 
houses at 1980 Union. The latter also were built by farmer Cudworth as wedding 
gifts for his two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Italiantate Beauties 
</P>
<P>
Many of Union Street's cafes are in vintage digs, and if you want to overnight 
Victorian-style, try the Bed and Breakfast Inn, housed in three Italianate 
beauties at No. 4 Charlton Court, midway in the 1900 block of Union. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to sample the life of the swells a century ago, make reservations 
at the exclusive Sherman House, one block east of Union at 2160 Green. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most elegant homes in the city when it was built in 1876 by the 
founder of the Sherman Clay Music Co., it remains a sanctuary of luxury, 
complete with private restaurant and a chauffer-driven Bentley in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Beloved by celebrities seeking low-visibility accommodations, each of its 15 
rooms is furnished in decorator luxury and with museum-quality antiques. But 
such pampering has its price -- from $210 to $650 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Other Victorian lodgings include the Queen Anne Hotel, 1590 Sutter; the 
Majestic, 1500 Sutter; the Mansion, 2220 Sacramento; Hermitage House, 2224 
Sacramento; Flood Mansion, 2222 Broadway; Spreckels Mansion, 737 Buena Vista; 
Victorian Inn on the Park, 301 Lyon St., and Archbishop's Mansion, 1000 Fulton

<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Three furnished Victorian mansions are open for tours. The 22-room

FOOTLOOSE: TORONTO CHANGES LIFE STYLE

TORONTO, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This vibrant, cosmopolitan city was once known as "Toronto the Good." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in the 17th Century by French fur traders who lost it to Britain with 
the fall of New France in the next century, it was christened "York" and soon 
after was nicknamed "Muddy York" because of its swamplike terrain. 
</P>
<P>
While Montreal and Quebec City tripped lightly along with their Gallic ways, 
Anglo-Saxon Toronto became so conservative that department stores not only 
didn't open on Sundays, they drew curtains over their windows so that righteous 
citizens wouldn't be tempted by earthly cravings on the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went until the end of World War II when Toronto, which had been 80% 
Anglo-Saxon, suddenly experienced an influx of immigrants who brought new life 
styles and cultures from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air Canada, Wardair American, Northwest, Eastern or Canadian 
International. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Three days should do it, unless you want to make forays into 
other interesting towns and regions of Ontario. Lodging and dining prices are 
moderate for a big city. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Canada's dollar was recently worth 85 cents U.S., a plus for 
American visitors. Visit any time between late spring and late fall. For winter 
visits, bring a parka. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled: Venture Inn (89 Avenue Road; $77-$82 double B&amp;B) sits 
downtown in the trendy Yorkville area. It's a nondescript modern building but 
comfortable and a real value. Inside decor is Early American, with bedrooms 
featuring huge maple beds, excellent baths and lobby hutches, giving it a 
country feeling. Breakfast only. 
</P>
<P>
The Windsor Arms (22 St. Thomas St.; $89-$153 double) has been our Toronto 
favorite, resembling a vine-covered English country manor with a very clublike 
interior. The antiques are real, the feeling warm. 
</P>
<P>
Dining facilities at Windsor Arms are known collectively as Three Small Rooms, 
which give you a choice of grills or more fancy fare to go with a superb wine 
selection. Windsor Arms, a step from Toronto's finest shopping, is a member of 
the worldwide Relais &amp; Chateaux group of hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The Westbury (475 Yonge St.; $89-$119 double) also is near the center of 
things. It's a large and lively place with good dining and most of the big city 
hotel amenities. Bedrooms are bright and comfortable, lots of business types in 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Although their city is without its own recognizable 
cuisine, Toronto natives are justifiably proud of its restaurants. The reason 
is that they have the best of the world's foods right at home, and the dining 
business continues to boom. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of Yorkville are chock-a-block with chic restaurants. Danford 
Avenue looks like a linear version of Athens' Plaka with its Greek cafes and 
tavernas. You'll also find Szechuan, Thai, French, Indian tandoori and Tony 
Roma's ribs. And Canadian beer is super. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Centro (2472 Yonge St.) in little more than a year has carved a 
reputation for turning out an upscale, imaginative northern Italian menu. It is 
bright, cheerful and contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
Try the Tuscan white-bean soup with sun-dried tomato and eggplant relish, or 
the penne with tomatoes, basil, olives and roasted chiles. 
</P>
<P>
Main courses such as grilled veal chop with sage aioli (sage-flavored 
mayonnaise), fried artichokes and pepper squash fall in the $14 to $18 range. 
Hot appetizers and pastas go for about $7. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Garden (18 Elm St.) is the most beautiful Thai restaurant we've seen. 
Elaborate use of wood, slate, brass, green plants and ponds create a truly 
opulent and serene setting. 
</P>
<P>
As curries are a Thai staple and to get them right takes a bit of doing, 
Bangkok Garden flies the curry paste and other exotic seasonings in from 
Thailand. Each dish carries a five-level, scale-of-heat symbol as a warning to 
diners, level four being described as a "raging fire," level five for 
"masochists only." 
</P>
<P>
An eight-page menu takes you through many of Thailand's finest dishes. The Gang 
Kiaw Waan Gai curried chicken kicks in with a five-alarm rating on the first 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
Bellair Cafe (100 Cumberland St.) stands in the middle of Yorkville and is the 
chic stop for Toronto's beautiful people at lunch or dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Decor is minimal, with dramatic contemporary art on stark white walls. You can 
dine on a terrace in good weather. A menu offers sage-Brie fritters with a plum 
conserve, salad of grilled chicken with pancetta and chives vinaigrette, 
fuselli with crab meat and asparagus in a light dill cream. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: The King Edward (37 King St. East; $183-$242 double) is a 
deluxe hotel. A traditional facade and elegant lobby give way to more 
contemporary bedrooms with every possible comfort and amenity. Dine beneath 
baroque ceilings and the pastel surroundings of Cafe Victoria any time of day, 
or more formally in Chiaro's for dinners of French cuisine and fine wines. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Toronto is a city of ethnic enclaves, each with its own color and 
character. Try to visit Little Italy ("Moonstruck" was filmed there), which 
centers around St. Clair Avenue West. Chinatown, Kensington Market near the 
Portuguese neighborhood and Cabbagetown (Victorian-Gothic architecture and very 
gentrified) are all worthy of your time. 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors head for the Eaton Centre arcade to shop or dine in one of 
Toronto's major tourist attractions. It's enormous and even has a waterfall to 
delight strollers. The Toronto underground is the world's largest subterranean 
complex of stores and restaurants, a weatherproof city where the temperature 
never falls below 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Gallery of Ontario has a respectable collection of works by Renoir, 
Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh and Picasso, with sculptures by Degas, Rodin, 
Matisse and the largest Henry Moore collection anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Drive or take public transportation to nearby Kleinburg for a visit to the 
McMichael Canadian Collection, built around the landscape paintings of Canada's 
Group of Seven artists. In this beautiful log-and-fieldstone gallery you'll 
also find exhibits of Canadian Indian art, masks and giant totems. You may also 
have lunch in the gallery. 
</P>

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: A WAR OF REMEMBRANCE IN NAGASAKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
NAGASAKI, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every few days, as a luxury foreign cruise ship emerges from the Inland Sea of 
Japan and enters the harbor, the old woman watches. 
</P>
<P>
The ship takes the same route the Portuguese did hundreds of years ago, 
rounding a natural anchorage and heading for a berth at one of Nagasaki's 
piers. 
</P>
<P>
Tugboats greet the ship with toots of their horns. And, as it approaches the 
main ship terminal, its passengers -- most of them American -- are suddenly 
treated to the tinny sounds of American standards blaring from four 
loudspeakers: bad recordings of "Whistle While You Work," "Davy Crockett," "Zip 
a Dee Doo Dah" and "When You Wish Upon a Star." 
</P>
<P>
The old woman watches the passengers disembark and head for their assigned tour 
buses. They will only be in port for a few hours. Some will go to Glover Garden 
or the Madame Butterfly House. Others will go to the Confucius Shrine. 
</P>
<P>
But the old woman sits and wonders how many will go to the Atomic Bomb Museum 
and Peace Park. She leaves her house and goes to the museum to greet any 
visitors that might arrive. She wants to tell her story. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-four years ago this week, on Aug. 9 at 11:02 a.m., an atomic bomb was 
dropped above the northern part of the city that turned Nagasaki into a valley 
of desolation. It killed 73,884 people and injured 76,796 others. Another 
120,820 were left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Hideko Yoshiyama knows these figures precisely because she was there. And she 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
I found her standing outside the museum. The building is a moving monument of 
apocalypse. It was crowded with children, many only 4 and 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Every schoolchild in Nagasaki comes here," she said. "We consider it an 
essential part of their education." 
</P>
<P>
The children watch a film about Aug. 9, made in 1952 by the U.S. Army. The 
grainy black-and-white documentary shows the destruction, the devastation, the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"The A-bomb is terrible," says the announcer. "It hurts us. Please, no more 
wars. These children will never return. They are resting in some unknown place 
dreaming of a peaceful Nagasaki." 
</P>
<P>
For Hideko Yoshiyama it is a recurring dream and a recurring nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hot summer day, just like today," she said. She was 22 years old at 
the time. "I was in the office of the Mitsubishi Steel Works (about 
three-quarters of a mile from the center of the explosion). 
</P>
<P>
"Each morning I commuted by tramcar to work. In the early morning hours of Aug. 
9 the air-raid sirens sounded. We escaped to the mountains. But no attack came. 
Then later we returned to work." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 11 a.m. she was back at her desk when it happened. When she 
touched the doorknob it was very hot. 
</P>
<P>
"I smelled magnesium, then the windows blew in," Yoshiyama said. "I started to 
bleed. I fainted, lost consciousness. I have no idea how much time I lost. When 
I woke up I was covered with glass, and many slivers of glass were imbedded in 
my body. 
</P>
<P>
"I got up and went into the office. Most of my fellow workers were dead, 
covered by the rubble. The whole building had been destroyed, and I was 
standing in the middle of a deformed steel skeleton. I fainted again." 
</P>
<P>
She ran from the building. "Along the way I saw nothing but dying people. It 
was as if we had all stopped breathing. Everything was reduced to 
shapelessness. There was no time to contemplate the unthinkable. But I remember 
thinking that I could not see a single blade of green grass. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to the air-raid shelter it was already full. People were crawling 
to the river to drink the water, and they were dying from the water, but they 
didn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
In the underground center she heard a co-worker calling her name. "She asked me 
what happened. I did not know what to say. She asked me for water. I got her 
some. I said, 'You look very beautiful.' She smiled and sipped the water. And 
then she died." 
</P>
<P>
Three days later Hideko's mother found her. "She took me to her house in a 
small two-wheel cart. There was no food to eat, nothing to drink. The 
vegetables were half-cooked by the heat. But we didn't know anything about 
radiation. We ate them." 
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, when she went to comb her hair, it fell out. Her gums were 
bleeding, she had a severe fever and diarrhea, and she began to urinate blood. 
"My mother took me to the doctor, but he said nothing could be done. He told my 
mother to take me back." 
</P>
<P>
Hideko began to hallucinate. "I felt I was dreaming. I was in Paradise. And 
someone was calling my name. It was my father." 
</P>
<P>
One of her sisters died a year after the blast. Her second sister died in 1987 
from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, Yoshiyama survived. 
</P>
<P>
She has been hospitalized 16 times. She's had lung operations, and one of her 
breasts has been removed. Glass slivers from the blast are permanently imbedded 
in her other breast. 
</P>
<P>
But Hideko Yoshiyama firmly holds onto her life. For her, Aug. 9 is every day, 
her permanent mission and a continuing struggle to pray for peace, to educate, 
to remember. 
</P>
<P>
"The yen may be powerful," she said with a smile, "and the expense of getting 
to and from Japan may be high. But nothing is more valuable than life. People 
should come here and see what happened so that they will know never to do it 
again. Nagasaki should be the last place on earth to be destroyed by nuclear 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The Atomic Bomb Museum receives 50,000 foreign visitors a year. "But it's not 
enough," she said. Hideko and some of the other survivors find it odd that in 
this nuclear age many world leaders have visited Japan, but no U.S. President 
has ever visited Nagasaki to see what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
"On this anniversary I hope I can put this terrible and terrifying experience 
into human perspective," she said. "I appreciate the preciousness of being 
alive, the dignity of human life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have experienced in my flesh and witnessed in my eyes the horror of the bomb 
and the misery of war. I have lived in the fear of radiation. It gives me more 
encouragement to talk about my experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to meet the leaders of nuclear powers. If I ever get that chance, 
I would ask them to join hands to make this world free from nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Until then," she said with a sigh, "the prayer for world peace continues." 
</P>
<P>
She wished me a good trip back home. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that you will sometimes think of me, an old woman in Nagasaki, a 
survivor." 
</P>
<P>

WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: VISITS TO PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA DISCOURAGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY, Habegger and O'Reilly are free-lance 
writers living in Northern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- China: Due to continuing unstable security conditions, travel here is not 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
 -- India: Kashmir's fabled Dal Lake, which for centuries has drawn Mogul 
princes, British colonialists and vacationers, is showing bad signs of 
environmental degradation. The lake has shrunk from 14 square miles to nine, 
weeds grow thick on the bottom and millions of gallons of raw sewage flow into 
the lake every day. New sewer systems need to be built, but state and national 
governments have been unable to provide the money for the sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nepal: New visa regulations have become stabilized. People entering Nepal 
with a visa obtained before arrival can stay for one month, and can get two 
one-month extensions. To obtain an extension, travelers must show proof that 
they have spent at least $10 a day for every day requested in the extension. 
</P>
<P>
After spending three months in Nepal, foreigners must leave the country for a 
minimum of one month before returning. Upon returning they will be able to 
remain in the country for only one more month, and then will be barred from 
returning for a year. Fifteen-day visas are available upon entry at a cost of 
$10. Travelers must prove they've spent at least $150. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who wish to leave the country during their initial three-month stay 
can make arrangements with the immigration office to allow re-entry even if the 
trip is for less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sri Lanka: The government recently granted powers to the police and 
military to detain suspected leftist rebels in an attempt to quell the 
Sinhalese two-year-old drive to overthrow the government. Peace talks with the 
Tamil Tigers in the north and east and negotiations to send the Indian 
peacekeeping army home continue. Conditions remain unstable although most main 
tourist sites are relatively safe. Exercise caution, however. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tibet: Although Tibet was recently reopened to foreigners, Western Tibet 
and the sacred Mt. Kailash region remain off-limits. However, Eastern Tibet, a 
rugged region of big rivers, forested mountains and log houses in a Swiss 
chalet style, has been opened to tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ghana: Ghana has strict laws governing currency exchange and the sale, 
purchase or possession of gold, diamonds and other natural resources. Currency 
transactions should take place at registered banks and foreign exchange 
bureaus. All natural-resource transactions are handled through official 
organizations; dealing in these commodities with individuals is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing clothing that appears military in nature, such as camouflage jackets, 
is strictly prohibited. Authorities are slow to notify foreign embassies when 
detaining foreigners; jail conditions are harsh and the legal process can be 
lengthy. There is no bond posting. If you get into trouble, make every effort 
to contact the American Embassy. Assume your message has not been delivered if 
a consular officer doesn't contact you within 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mozambique: Travel remains dangerous due to continuing insurgency. 
Guerrillas are active in all of the country's provinces, and have stepped up 
their attacks even as the government makes efforts through the Mozambican 
Christian Church to find a way to peace. Food shortages exist in rural areas 
and many district capitals. Street crime and car thefts in urban areas have 
increased dramatically in the last year. Avoid unnecessary travel, and exercise 
caution. Register with the U.S. Embassy on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sao Tome and Principe: A serious cholera outbreak is occurring. Travelers 
without valid vaccinations will be refused entry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somalia: A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed recently in Mogadishu in 
response to religious disturbances in which protesters and police were killed. 
Defer non-essential travel at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean/Middle East 
</P>
<P>
 -- Turkey: Exercise caution in Turkey's southeastern provinces, where sporadic 
separatist attacks against Turkish military, police and civilians continue to 
occur. Avoid travel off main highways in remote regions, and if possible, don't 
drive at night. Be sure to obtain a receipt and an official museum export 
certificate if buying antiquities or cultural artifacts. Unauthorized export is 
strictly prohibited and punishable by imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Europe/Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet Union: Ethnic disturbances continue in many areas of this vast 
country, most recently in the Abkhazi region of Georgia, causing officials to 
declare a state of emergency and a dusk-to-dawn curfew. The troubles disrupted 
transport and communications in and around the Black Sea resort of Sukhumi. 
Unrest is likely to continue. Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Union of Myanmar (Burma): The government has moved in recent weeks to 
repress opposition rallies, pouring thousands of troops into the capital and 
placing opposition leaders under house arrest, making the free elections 
promised by the military government seem less likely than ever. Exercise 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Malaysia: The recent execution by hanging of an Englishman for drug 
trafficking underscores the severity of Malaysia's drug laws. Death is 
mandatory for anyone caught trafficking in even small amounts of heroin or 
marijuana (more than half an ounce of heroin, seven ounces of marijuana). Avoid 
all contact with illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thailand: Thai health officials recently reported a substantial increase in 
acquired immune deficiency infections (AIDS) among female prostitutes, 
particularly in the tourist areas of Chiang Mai and Pattaya. 
</P>
<P>
There have been four serious train accidents in the last three months, a 
discouraging safety record. However, the train is usually considered a safer 
alternative than bus or truck for overland travel.

HER WORLD: GETTING THE REAL SCOOP ON ICE CREAM IN ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is warm this August afternoon. I think I'll slip down to the kitchen and 
have a glass of iced coffee and a scoop of store-bought sherbet. 
</P>
<P>
I will do that because it is there, and I have vowed not to stray far from my 
desk. If I were free to wander anywhere for an ice cream break, I'd go to Italy 
-- home of the winsome gelato. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I would head for a table at the gelato palace of Vivoli, near the 
magnificent Santa Croce Church in Florence. Santa Croce is a Franciscan 
showplace, a splendid art museum and the site of Michelangelo's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Croce also is the home of a best-buy leather goods shop, with wares made 
by students of the church's leathercraft school. 
</P>
<P>
On August afternoons I imagine that the students and friars also are tempted to 
slip over to Vivoli at 7 Via Isola delle Stinche. I would nod to them in 
passing as I chose a cup of the sinfully rich gelato called Tira Misu, a flavor 
that blends espresso, dark chocolate and real cream. The name translates as 
"pick-me-up," which is what I need this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glittering With Tiles 
</P>
<P>
Farther south in Tuscany I would walk up from the fan-shaped Piazza del Campo, 
in the medieval heart of Siena, to a gelateria called Nannini. 
</P>
<P>
The emporium at 99 Banchi de Sopra glitters with pink and white tiles. Flavors 
are arranged as if on an artist's palette: pastel sherbets (called granita) are 
at one end of the spectrum, the deepest chocolate combinations hold down the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
It was at this Nannini (other branches serve less ice cream and more other 
stuff, like jawbreaker panforte cakes) that I first tasted tartufo, a flavor as 
decadent as a double chocolate truffle. 
</P>
<P>
The evening passeggiata, or promenade, winds down the curving street, past 
Nannini and its neighbor, the ornate headquarters of the Monte dei Paschi di 
Siena. Said to be the world's oldest operating bank, it opened two years before 
Columbus visited America. 
</P>
<P>
On its stone piazza is a statue of Sallustio Bandini, a Siena economist and 
priest. He is wearing a full-length cassock. The fifth button from the top is 
unbuttoned, as are three at the waist. He is scowling across at Nannini. Could 
these things be related? 
</P>
<P>
In the towered hill town of San Gimignano I would line up at the gelato window 
of the Pasticceria Mercella e Armando, near the central Piazza della Cisterna. 
Walnut and filbert are among their homemade treats. The owners are proud 
members of the Italian gelato society, which assures that the ice cream is made 
on the premises and is of superior quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famed for Mosaics 
</P>
<P>
In Ravenna I would go back to the Gelateria San Vitale on the Via Cavour near 
the Basilica of San Vitale, famed for its dazzling 6th-Century mosaics. Trays 
of wild strawberry ice cream are topped with small crimson berries. Slices of 
kiwi fruit and curls of lemon are other flavors. The house specialty is Cremino 
San Vitale, which smacks of frozen cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, near the Piazza Colonna, there is the marble-floored Giolitti, where 
Romans would do battle -- in season -- for a dish of the fresh chestnut puree 
called marroni. Bittersweet chocolate is always a winner. 
</P>
<P>
But all roads don't lead to Rome, or even Italy. If my craving for ice cream 
took me to Paris, I'd happily cross the footbridge behind Notre Dame Cathedral 
and merge with the faithful at Berthillon's parlor on the Ile St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
From a chalkboard of fresh flavors I would order ripe Camembert ice cream, or 
Glace au The de Chine (made with smoky Chinese tea, perhaps Lapsang Souchong), 
or some splendid concoction I have never tried before. 
</P>
<P>
Berthillon's is where I was first forced to eat my words about the blandness of 
vanilla ice cream. The family boasts of using vanilla beans from Madagascar, 
which they favor over the beans from Tahiti. The result is like an exotic nut 
swirl. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago I again scoffed at vanilla ice cream -- this time on an 
all-Hawaiian menu in the Garden restaurant at the Mauna Kea Hotel on the Big 
Island. Why would anyone choose plain vanilla -- even if made with local beans 
-- in a land lush with guavas, mangoes, coconuts and pineapples? On an island 
where Kona coffee grows, and there are macadamia nut trees? 
</P>
<P>
I clung to my macadamia instincts for dessert, but my husband ordered the 
vanilla and insisted that I have a taste. 
</P>
<P>
I can only describe its silky texture, subtle crunch and heady sweetness by 
confessing that it was as wondrous as chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the real scoop, if not the real skinny.

STEPPING BACK 150 YEARS ON INDIANA'S SCENIC TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AURORA, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Gaff made Crescent Beer, which was considered good enough to export to 
Germany. He also made Thistledew Whiskey, about which little is recorded, and 
Ceraline, the first packaged cold cereal. And he owned steamships. 
</P>
<P>
With the profits from those sundry enterprises the 19th-Century industrialist 
could well afford to have any kind of home he wanted, almost anywhere he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
And the house that Gaff built -- in 1852 at a crook in the Ohio River called 
Aurora, Ind. -- is the back road tourist's introductory treat to a lazy, loopy 
75-mile stretch of the Ohio River Scenic Route. 
</P>
<P>
Easily reachable from either Cincinnati or Louisville, the clearly marked route 
winds along the northern, or Indiana bank, of the broad river on Indiana 
highways 56 and 156 from tiny Aurora to Madison, which has often been described 
as the nation's "19th-Century Williamsburg." 
</P>
<P>
In any season the route offers wide, soothing vistas of the winding river and 
surrounding hills in Indiana and Kentucky, and a peaceful glimpse back into 
Midwestern life a century and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overlooking Town, River 
</P>
<P>
Gaff's lemon-yellow house, Hillforest, is easily found in Aurora, majestically 
overlooking town and river from the "top" or hill end of Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by the Gaff family until 1927, the mansion was the meeting and 
entertainment site for three decades of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars 
before it was bought and restored in 1956 by the Hillforest Historical 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Guided tours are available Tuesday-Sunday, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. from May 1 to Dec. 
23, for a $3 fee. Information about meeting facilities or special events, 
including Christmas teas and solve-the-murder-mystery buffet dinners, can be 
obtained by writing to the foundation at P.O. Box 221, Aurora, Ind. 47001, or 
calling (812) 926-0087. 
</P>
<P>
History-minded townswomen proudly show visitors through the three-story home, 
designed personally by Gaff, who amusingly incorporated his favorite steamship 
features into the architecture of an Italian Renaissance villa. 
</P>
<P>
Signed and dated molds for the ornate plaster lace that edges each formal 
chandelier and ceiling have been found in the foundations of the house, but 
Gaff's design plans have never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among Gaff's steamship-as-house touches is the round third-floor 
belvedere modeled on a pilot house and complete with mounted spyglass and river 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
Gaff entertained his male friends here in the room with unquestionably the best 
view of Aurora and the river. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore the male-only nature of the special aerie, the sole access 
stairway was built too narrow to accommodate 19th-Century women's voluminous 
hoop skirts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsupported Staircase 
</P>
<P>
The house also boasts a vast, unsupported "flying" wooden staircase from the 
first-floor entry to the second floor, akin to those of river boat grand 
salons. Despite the creak of the stairs under the tourist's step, guides point 
out that the design is so strong that it even supported a pony the Gaff 
offspring once rode upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the several trompe l'oeil touches that challenge restoration artists and 
intrigue visitors are flat wallpaper that appears to be recessed molding, and 
peacock glass windows in the huge cypress doors, which are red and gold on one 
side and red and blue on the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion contains a small shop with post cards and needlework and a small 
museum with Gaff family news clippings and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
The broad front porch with rocking chairs and a stone-seated perch atop the 
outdoor "melon cellar," where the Gaffs cooled foods with ice cut and carried 
from the frozen river, afford peaceful places to rest and reflect before 
continuing the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Just downriver from Aurora sits the dot on the map called Rising Sun, where 
vacationers can picnic in a delightful river-bank park, or on weekends and 
holidays take a sightseeing or dinner cruise on the Hoosier Belle. 
</P>
<P>
Rising Sun is a good starting point for camping, fishing or boating excursions 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Information can be obtained from the Rising Sun Tourism Bureau, P.O. Box 95, 
Rising Sun, Ind. 47040, or by calling (812) 438-2319. Information on tours or 
charters and reservations on the Hoosier Belle are available by calling (812) 
438-3212. 
</P>
<P>
Meandering farther along the scenic route the traveler arrives in Switzerland 
County and the tiny town of Vevay (pronounced Veevy), named and misspelled for 
the settlers' hometown of Vevey, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine Grapes Planted 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining a land grant for the area in 1802, the Swiss planted wine grapes in 
the sandy soil. The grape culture eventually was replaced by tobacco and other 
crops, and the river town prospered. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 2,000, the modern Vevay is a cozy town that plays 
host to horse-pulling contests in June, ice cream socials on the Fourth of July 
and a Swiss wine festival in August. The weekly Switzerland Democrat prints 
community news such as: 
</P>
<P>
"It's been gloomy all day here on Tapps Ridge and we had a few showers. I told 
the kids this is blackberry winter and they are in bloom. Mrs. Maude Hamilton 
called on Mrs. Hildred James Sunday afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
And, "Berniece Scott saw her doctor in Madison Monday due to her hip coming out 
of place. The life squad took her to the hospital where they put the hip back 
into place. The life squad brought her home. William and Vandora Bennett called 
on her that evening." 
</P>
<P>
Wandering on foot or slowly by car along Vevay's little-traveled streets, the 
history or architecture buff can easily find favorites: 
</P>
<P>
The columned brick Switzerland County Courthouse, completed in 1864 at a cost 
of $30 million and still serving the county's 7,150 residents; the birthplace 
of Edward Eggleston, who wrote the Midwestern classic "The Hoosier 
Schoolmaster"; or the Coon Saloon, an occasional stopping place for Daniel 
Boone. 
</P>
<P>
Indian artifacts, Ohio River lore, Civil War mementos and Indiana's oldest 
piano are on display in the county's Historical Museum at Main and Market 
streets. It is open Wednesday through Sunday, May through October, 12:30-4:30 
p.m., and admission costs $1. 
</P>
<P>
On the west end of Vevay, where state highways 156 and 56 rejoin, is the Scenic 
Route's best place to spend a night, or more -- the Ogle Haus Inn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antique-Filled Hotel 
</P>
<P>
Built only a few years ago by a wealthy history-minded citizen, the 
antique-filled hotel resembles a Bavarian-Swiss inn, complete with stein room. 
The river-view dining room offers a wide range of delectable and affordable 
entrees from blackened Cajun whitefish at $7.95 to the more expected 
German-Swiss fare of sauerbraten at $11.55 or Wiener schnitzel at $10.55. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has 50 balconied rooms, most with a river view and a happy mix of 
modern and antique furniture, meeting and banquet facilities for up to 200, a 
solarium for reading or cards, an outdoor pool and a river-bank gazebo poised 
for catching the breeze and watching the soothing river roll by. 
</P>
<P>
Rates are $55-$60 for singles and $60-$65 for doubles April 1-Oct. 31, and $15 
less in the remaining months. Suites also are available. For information or 
reservations, write to Ogle Haus Inn, P.O. Box 177, Vevay, Ind. 47043, or phone 
(812) 427-2020. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty miles downriver lies Madison, the verdant, hilly backdrop for the films 
"Raintree County" and "Some Came Running." 
</P>
<P>
Incorporated in 1824, the impeccably maintained "19th-Century Williamsburg" is 
a demonstration city of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. And 133 
city blocks are listed in the National Registry of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer transportation hub of river boats, railroads and wagons, Madison 
was once Indiana's most prominent and prosperous city. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy settlers built sturdy homes like those they left behind in Virginia 
or Maryland. The mansions still stand, some historians claim, because there was 
no money to tear them down when fortunes fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greek Revival Mansion 
</P>
<P>
Most imposing of the homes is the beautifully restored Greek Revival mansion of 
financier J. F. D. Lanier, which is appropriately maintained by the state of 
Indiana. During the Civil War, Lanier magnanimously loaned the faltering state 
treasury $1 million interest free. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier's home and extensive garden stretching down to the river front are open 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Shops in the city's converted trolley barn and an antique mall in a former 
paper mill, plus frequent sidewalk flea markets, make Madison a delightful 
place to shop or browse. 
</P>
<P>
Madison, which annually stages a Chatauqua of the Arts fair and a Christmas 
candlelight tour of historic sites, was not always so genteel. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1800s pirates sometimes sank river boats at that bend of the river. 
Even among the area's solid citizens, one-third of all voters purportedly had 
been arrested for non-payment of debts, rioting or disturbances, and 90% of the 
farmers had their own stills. 
</P>
<P>
A schedule of special events, maps of historic homes and other information can 
be obtained from the Madison Chamber of Commerce, Madison, Ind. 47250. 
</P>
<P>
Above Indiana 56, appropriately beside yet another of the imposing county 
courthouses strewn throughout Indiana, the familiar blue and white sign in 
Madison declares "End Ohio River Scenic Route." 
</P>
<P>
That back road getaway is accessible from Cincinnati or its airport in northern 
Kentucky by driving northwest on Interstate 275, crossing the Ohio River into 
Indiana at Lawrenceburg, then turning west on U.S. 50 at Exit 16, and southwest 
on Indiana 56 at Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
From Louisville, drive northeast on I-71, exiting north on U.S. 421 and 
crossing the river into Madison, then turning east on Indiana 56.

NOT FOR THE SEDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The island of Ios ("Ios Offers Best of Cyclades Without the Crowds," July 16), 
is not for the sedate or the faint of heart. Like Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., during 
spring break, the island is home to the Greek definition of hedonism but 
without the sunshine state's amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily, Ios attracts a young Scandinavian crowd that spends the summer 
sewing its oats on the nude beaches and in the wild discos. Ouzo spills faster 
and more abundantly than water and European rock music fills the nighttime air. 
</P>
<P>
(The book) "Let's Go Greece '88" describes Ios as having "more counter-culture 
types per square foot than any other place in the world." Such words should be 
fair warning for those individuals whose oats have already been sown.

BULLDOZERS SCULPT ORANGE COUNTY'S 'CROWN JEWEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rumble of earthmovers can be heard above the roar of the surf these days 
along the coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The work signals the start of development of a 9,400-acre expanse of coastal 
land, the crown jewel of Orange County's old Irvine Ranch and one of the last 
large undeveloped shoreline tracts in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Development plans were hammered out over more than two decades of debate 
between the Irvine Co., which owns the land, and local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a year and a half ago, they agreed on a plan that will keep 
three-fourths of the area as public parks, including nearly all the land on the 
coast side of the highway, while still allowing creation of a resort community 
with two golf courses, 2,600 mostly hilltop homes and up to four hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Now an army of yellow bulldozers, earthmovers and water trucks can be seen 
traversing the hills inland from Coast Highway, cutting a path for Pelican Hill 
Road, a 55 m.p.h. artery that will link the planned new coastal development 
with the city of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The $40-million road, scheduled for completion in late 1991, will stretch 6 
miles inland and link up with the proposed San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor, which will intersect MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s project manager for the coastal development, Bernard 
Maniscalco, said the planned community will contain "some of the most expensive 
housing in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company is working with "five major Orange County builders," whom 
he declined to identify, on plans for construction of 570 "very special" tract 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on slopes adjacent to Pelican Hill Road, they will sell at prices "in 
the order of $1 million" when they begin to hit the market in late 1990, 
Maniscalco said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the company in 1991 plans to open the golf courses, 
including four holes on the ocean side of Coast Highway, and to begin selling 
custom home sites, including 55 parcels in a golf course-ringed seaside enclave 
to be called Cameo del Mar, and large hillside lots with expansive ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
On a slope called Wishbone Hill will be gated communities of homes with 10,000 
to 25,000 square feet on estates of 2 to 7 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco said the company is also talking with hotel operators. Although no 
one has made a firm commitment, he said, those who have expressed interest in 
the proposed hotel developments include Marriott Corp., Stouffer Hotel 
Management Corp., Hyatt Corp. and Princess Hotel International. He said his 
"best guess" is that the first hotel will open in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
While only the well-to-do will be able to afford homes in the resort 
development, Irvine Co. officials stressed that there are substantial 
provisions for public recreation and wildlife conservation in vast reaches of 
coastal and interior land. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the canyon land yet to be deeded to the county over the 10- to 15-year 
build-out of the project is not visible from Coast Highway. It has been 
off-limits to the public while under the ownership of the Irvine Co., which 
used it for cattle grazing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Park of the Park 
</P>
<P>
Most of the land on the ocean side of Coast Highway plus one inland canyon are 
already part of Crystal Cove State Park, which the state acquired from the 
Irvine Co. in 1979. There will also be a 2,666-acre county wilderness park, 
three separate canyon parks totaling 1,100 acres and 367 acres of golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Jessen, chief of planning and acquisition for county harbors, beaches and 
parks, said that from the top of the proposed wilderness park hikers will be 
able to see "everything from La Jolla 50 miles to the south to Palos Verdes 40 
miles north and beyond. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Planners are trying to keep the parkland dedications contiguous, company and 
environmental officials said, to reduce disturbance to wildlife, including 
coyotes, deer, foxes and even some badgers and mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there are foes of the development who want more of nature 
preserved. A sign on Coast Highway announcing the Pelican Hill Road project has 
been repeatedly splattered with paint by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wildlife Corridors 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Brown, a biologist and president of Laguna Greenbelt Inc., an 
environmental group fighting to retain open space, said she fears that Pelican 
Hill Road will obstruct wildlife corridors in the canyons and force deer and 
coyotes into the path of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials, who are providing technical support to the county in 
construction of Pelican Hill Road, contend it has been carefully sculpted to do 
minimal environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Hoffman, the Irvine Co.'s vice president of entitlement for the coastal 
project, acknowledged that "there had to be trade-offs" in plans for the resort 
development. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she said, the company agreed to avoid construction in canyon 
bottoms, where native vegetation and animals abide, on the condition that it 
may grade and build on ridge lines that offer scenic vistas.

HOT PROPERTY: WHEN MEG MET DINAH . . . SOLD! 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MEG RYAN, who co-stars with Billy Crystal in the Rob Reiner movie "When Harry 
Met Sally . . . ," has sold the Hollywood Hills home she bought about a year 
ago to DINAH MANOFF, who is in the cast of the television show "Empty Nest." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan remodeled the 42-year-old house, which public records indicate she bought 
for $362,000 and sold for $630,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story house has three bedrooms, two baths and a fireplace in 1,974 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
ROSEANNE BARR, star of the hit TV sitcom "Roseanne," has leased a country-style 
house with a pool and a tennis court in the Beverly Hills Post Office area. The 
asking rent was $20,000 a month. Stan Herman &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills, 
had the rental listing. 
</P>
<P>
DAVID McHUGH, who composed the music for the movies "Mr. North" and "Three 
Fugitives," just purchased a home in Mandeville Canyon near Tom Selleck's for 
$1.92 million. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh's new residence is a rustic Connecticut-style farmhouse on slightly more 
than 3 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Theodora Kinder of Fred Sands' Santa Monica office handled the listing and the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
LIBERACE'S home for many years, on an acre-sized knoll above Sunset Strip, is 
for sale at $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
The late entertainer updated the 12,000-square-foot mansion, built in the '30s, 
when he owned it in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
It has been described as being in "move-in condition," but its listing agent, 
Bruce Nelson of Asher Dann &amp; Associates, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its view, it is one of the great sites in town, and someone could 
easily take the house off the property." 
</P>
<P>
For Liberace fans, there are such reminders of him in the house, however, as an 
organ and some chandeliers, which are included along with other furnishings in 
the asking price. The current owners are moving to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
ERROL FLYNN'S former home, where the late actor installed one-way mirrors in a 
bedroom ceiling to spy on his famous guests, was torn down recently to make way 
for a 14,000-square-foot mansion, but owners of the Mulholland Drive property 
didn't get that far. 
</P>
<P>
After razing the Flynn house, the owners, who bought the place from the Ricky 
Nelson estate, landscaped the 3-acre site but never started construction. 
</P>
<P>
"They had planned to live there but decided to stay where they are," said a 
spokeswoman for Fred Sands Estates, which has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
The property -- with a pool, a tennis court and an English garden -- is for 
sale at $4.85 million, including plans, through Joe Babajian, Judy Cycon, Ginna 
Schenck and Ernestine Fields of Fred Sands Estates, Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis courts, pools and even gyms are now considered standard by upscale home 
buyers, according to a survey completed the other day by Stan Herman &amp; 
Associates. Upscale in this survey means anyone who pays $5 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
His-and-her bathrooms are also on the list of items deemed "not impressive" to 
the upscale buyer, said Stephen Shapiro, who is Herman's partner. 
</P>
<P>
Among the impressive features, which the survey labels "most sought-after," 
are: 
</P>
<P>
Recording studios, projection rooms, tanning parlors, catering kitchens, 
putting greens, waterfalls, motorized chandeliers, indoor lap pools and a floor 
space of at least 10,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The survey applies to homes in the area that realtors call The Platinum 
Triangle: Bel-Air, Beverly Hills and Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian/actor JOHN BYNER and his singer/actress wife Cassandra have listed 
Tovu Island in Fiji, which they've owned for five years, at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The island has a home and three boats on it," said Lisa Seagram of Stan Herman 
&amp; Associates, who has the listing. "And he dug out the harbor there 
himself. But it's a little far away, and he's a busy guy. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to turn their island into a house here. It is about the same price 
as a house in the flats (of Beverly Hills)." The Byners have been renting in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
CURTIS HENDRIX, long active in East Coast real estate, is "basically relocating 
here," said a Los Angeles spokesman for the entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix, who formed a partnership last January to acquire the Sanwa Bank 
Building in downtown Los Angeles (at a cost, including redesign plans, of $135 
million), has put his three East Coast residences, valued at a total of $14 
million, on the market. (These include homes in West Hampton, Long Island; Boca 
Raton, Fla., and a historical mansion in Manhattan's exclusive Grammercy Park.) 
</P>
<P>
He is looking for a Malibu mansion in the $6-million range. (He already bought 
a $4-million home, once owned by the late Yul Brynner, in Holmby Hills.) 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Hendrix said: 
</P>
<P>
"Relocation of my personal residences to California is based purely on my 
choice of life style and reflects no change in my investment objectives. Our 
companies will continue their bi-coastal direction." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix has bought and sold more than 3 million square feet of offices and more 
than 20,000 apartments.

AT HOME: FONTANA SHEDDING ITS STEEL TOWN IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW SUBDIVISIONS ON THE OUTSKIRTS ARE A SHARP CONTRAST TO OLDER PARTS OF THE 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many newcomers to the multiplying suburban sprawl of inland Southern 
California, Ingrid Galeano Morrison didn't know one city from the next. She 
certainly didn't know Fontana until she, her mother and sisters bought a house 
there a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
And now there are times when she wishes she had done a little more homework 
before being lured by some of the best housing prices east of Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known the city looked like this . . . , " she mused, while tending 
the front lawn of the family's new, four-bedroom, two-bath home. Morrison 
doesn't finish her thought. The $130,000 price tag on the family's dream house, 
she knows, makes up for a lot. 
</P>
<P>
And she has absolutely no complaints about her immediate, spanking-new 
neighborhood. It's just the south-central part of town that depresses her. 
</P>
<P>
This old-time section of Fontana, which stretches north from Valley Boulevard 
just out of the shadow of the shuttered Kaiser Steel mill, seems to be home to 
half of the world's auto repair shops and a good number of its Confederate flag 
retailers. And long blocks close to the old downtown are spotted with 
debris-littered lots and dilapidated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Has Doubled 
</P>
<P>
"It's tacky, very, very," Morrison said. "But, maybe I should be grateful. 
People tell me it used to be worse." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Fontana is changing. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the city's population has nearly doubled to 80,000 as 
thousands of young and largely upwardly mobile families have decided to trek 
even farther inland in search of housing bargains. 
</P>
<P>
They find pay dirt in Fontana. New, detached, single-family homes can be 
purchased for as little as about $110,000, and nothing costs more than 
$250,000. The average price of a new home, according to the city's housing 
division, is $128,052. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a wide selection from which to choose. No fewer than 18 new 
subdivisions are under construction; another 20 are under review by the city's 
planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More House for Money 
</P>
<P>
Many of Fontana's new residents are first-time homeowners. And just as many are 
move-up buyers seeking to get more house for their dollar than they can in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
But although these families are willing to give up their old neighborhood ties 
and commute longer distances to their jobs in exchange for their housing 
bargains, they seem loath to abandon community values and expectations shaped 
by other areas of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a bit disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
As in so many other fast-growing older communities, a schism has developed 
between the established working-class residents who liked Fontana for the steel 
town that it was and the new families who would mold it into something with a 
bit more style, charm and pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
One story that circulated widely several years ago was told about two young 
housewives who had moved into Southridge Village, then the city's newest 
planned community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Culture Clash 
</P>
<P>
The women were apparently so concerned about the negative image of Fontana that 
they refused to use it as their mailing address, substituting "Southridge 
Village" as their hometown. Through the miracle of ZIP codes, they still got 
their mail. 
</P>
<P>
This culture clash was, in many ways, inevitable. Unlike the entirely new 
residential communities that are springing up throughout Southern California, 
such as Moreno Valley in Riverside County and vast stretches of Orange County, 
Fontana is an established city with thousands of longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
As the onslaught of new home buyers continues, the differences between old and 
new becomes more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether people realize it or not, Fontana is becoming a segregated city," said 
Rudy Cruz, a 35-year-old RTD bus scheduler and father of three who moved from 
San Gabriel into a new home in the city's emerging northwestern quadrant last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not segregation by race, but by economics. It's the old residents versus 
the new." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Whole Big City' 
</P>
<P>
Fontana's city leaders downplay the importance of such comments, noting that 
virtually all communities undergoing population explosions suffer growing pains 
and temporary imbalances until the growth pace slackens and the new residents 
have been absorbed into the city's mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"In another 10 years, we'll be one whole big city," says Chamber of Commerce 
director Meredith Watkins. "Until then, there's bound to be some isolation of 
the new residents. It's normal; it's geography. And it will change." 
</P>
<P>
John Anicic Jr., a Fontana resident for nearly 20 years, says newcomers aren't 
the only ones affected by the changes brought on by growth. 
</P>
<P>
There's more traffic and the city is more crowded," he explains. "This town 
used to be like a country farming town. Now things are more spread out." 
</P>
<P>
But Anicic, the manager of Foothill Builders Mart, a lumber and hardware store, 
isn't terribly concerned about the city's new residents. "They don't have ties 
to town yet, but they're slowly getting involved. It takes time." 
</P>
<P>
Establishing civic pride has not come easily for Fontana. And the burgeoning 
growth, which city leaders have courted as a means of erasing the past and 
capitalizing on the future, hasn't completely wiped out remnants of Fontana's 
history as a rural community that was home to thousands of lunch pail-carrying 
steel workers. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana traces its roots to the early 1900s when A.B. Miller, the first of the 
two men who would forever shape its economic course, arrived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Steel Plant 
</P>
<P>
Miller envisioned a planned rural community on the 28-square-mile expanse of 
sagebrush and established the Fontana Farms Co. to develop the land into farms 
that produced everything from grain and walnuts to eggs and hogs. 
</P>
<P>
Henry J. Kaiser, arguably the city's most influential business leader, arrived 
in the early 1940s with plans to build the nation's first West Coast steel 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, he began transforming Miller's hog farm into what was to become the 
Kaiser steel mill, a plant that operated at breakneck pace through World War II 
and the postwar expansion until changing economic conditions forced its closure 
a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Kaiser name and influence lives on; Fontana is home to one of the 
largest Kaiser Permanente medical facilities in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Image Consideration 
</P>
<P>
But to many Southern Californians, the steel mill made Fontana synonymous with 
smoke-belching heavy industry. And still others remember Fontana as the 
birthplace of the Hells Angels motorcycle outlaws and the site of periodic 
outbursts from members of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers, recognizing that this old image could harm their potential, 
have aimed their projects toward Interstate 15, the Devore Freeway, and the 
surrounding undeveloped acreage, rather than toward the city's established 
corridor along Interstate 10, which takes travelers past the old steel mill and 
through the city's older sections. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's new subdivisions are located in its two largest planned 
communities, Southridge Village and the Village of Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage, which recently opened in the city's northwest quadrant, features rows 
of stately palms and blocks of dusty-pink homes with terra-cotta-colored roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Cruz moved into Heritage Village in March, paying $150,000 for a 
four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath house on a street filled with youngsters and young 
families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Park, Shopping Center 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the area just a few blocks away where developers are planning 
quarter-million-dollar homes, Cruz believes his house has already appreciated. 
"I definitely got more house for my money than I could have back in L.A.," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At completion, Heritage Village is expected to have about 4,000 homes, a 
community park and neighborhood shopping centers. However, for the time being 
just a smattering of new subdivisions have been built. 
</P>
<P>
Southridge is by far the larger and the older planned community. Located just 
south of Interstate 10 and east of Interstate 15, Southridge is expected to 
have about 10,000 homes at completion. About 3,500 homes have already been 
built and new neighborhood shopping centers are just now starting to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have designated land adjacent to Southridge as the site of a 
future regional shopping center, Empire Mall. Officials say they expect the 
center will be built in the mid-1990s on a site near the intersection of 
Interstate 10 and Sierra Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
That's the event chamber director Watkins is waiting for. When the mall opens, 
Watkins predicts Fontana will be known less as the birthplace of the Hells 
Angels than the home of a regional shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll say: 'Fontana. Yeah. That's where the mall is,' " Watkins said. "And 
the rest will be forgotten."

SAM HALL KAPLAN: IS ARCHITECTURE BECOMING THE LATEST MERCHANDISING FAD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Fad, fashion and style merchandising should not be called architecture," 
declared the venerable John Lautner, the designer of some of Los Angeles' more 
singular and lyrical houses. 
</P>
<P>
Lautner's comment was scribbled on a newspaper item he sent me announcing that 
the American Institute of Architects had sold its monthly magazine, 
Architecture, to a company that also publishes the tony Interiors magazine, as 
well as the Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's new direction is to be "unabashedly marketplace-oriented," said 
Donald Canty, its editor of 15 years, who subsequently has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement disturbed Lautner, one of the profession's icons, whose 
creations in a 50-year career are distinguished by expressive structural 
innovations. Among his designs is the octagonal Chemosphere House perched on a 
concrete stalk in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
This magazine's sale also should disturb architects and others who had looked 
forward each month to its relatively unbiased survey of the latest noteworthy 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
There also were occasional, welcomed discussions of social, political and moral 
issues confronting the profession that most of the design media has tended to 
ignore, preferring instead to focus on trashy but trendy confectionery. 
</P>
<P>
While these discussions might seem at first glance too professionally 
introspective, their implications go far beyond the design world to shape the 
look, feel and function of our homes, neighborhoods and cities. 
</P>
<P>
Lautner contended that architecture appears to have become just another 
bottom-line business, with select architects as promotional artists catering to 
clients in search of status symbols. "And an undiscerning media is playing 
right into their hands," he added. 
</P>
<P>
How undiscerning is the design media was underlined by Janice Evason, an 
advertising and marketing executive based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the media is no longer interested in informing and educating," she 
said, "but simply wants to be entertaining, in the hope of building circulation 
and increasing advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"So what we have is eye-catching formats decorated by articles about 
inoffensive hot properties and warm, cuddly personalities, replacing the cold 
steel of criticism and social commentary architecture and city planning needs," 
added Evason, whose has worked for Young &amp; Rubicam and Foote Cone &amp; 
Belding. 
</P>
<P>
Cited was the redesign of House &amp; Garden magazine, now called HG (some say 
short for Haute Gauche), into a gossipy Architectural Digest, the emergence of 
Metropolitan Home as a sort of yuppie guide to what's hot and what's not, and 
the proliferation in Los Angeles of various facile art and design publications. 
</P>
<P>
"They are pretty, but they present a very narrow, elitist view of architecture, 
in which architects over-design teapots and decorate overpriced restaurants," 
observed Michael Ross, of the architectural firm of Ross/Wou International. 
</P>
<P>
"The essence of design -- creating usable, attractive space -- is being 
submerged in a self-indulgent sea," added Ross, who also swims against the tide 
on the faculty of Southern California Institute of Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the current drift of design was commented on in the July issue of 
Architecture in an article entitled "The Architect and Society," written before 
the disclosure that the magazine had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Under examination was the profession's shift over the last decade away from 
issues of social responsibility, such as dealing with the environment, urban 
growth and affordable housing, and toward what is described as "sentimental 
fritterings with form." 
</P>
<P>
Among those quoted was Michael Brill, of the respected Buffalo Organization for 
Social and Technological Innovation, who declared that architecture "has become 
part of the distraction and entertainment industry," with "a fraudulently 
soothing and sentimental Bartles &amp; James quality." 
</P>
<P>
He and other educators from the Boston Architectural Center to USC and UC 
Berkeley, contended in the article that many architects, whether out of 
impotence or indifference, have retreated from the social concerns of the 
profession to posture as artists. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that the current emphasis in design is not on how buildings respond 
to their settings, serve their users or simply whether they work or not, but 
rather on their image. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, images are what catches the eye of trade publication editors, 
desperate to be au courant, and potential clients, in particular those wanting 
to flaunt their wealth. 
</P>
<P>
And so in Los Angeles these days we have the rich and famous buying designer 
houses and restaurants like they buy designer clothes, followed by a flock of 
photo-publicists and fawning writers. Criticism has given way to promotion. 
</P>
<P>
For a glimpse of this world, check out the latest issue of Metropolitan Home, 
which features a collection of puff pieces promoting Los Angeles as a font of 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
No cliche goes unturned in a rear-mirror view of the latest in architecture, 
interior design, fashion and food. Even the Steel Cloud, the design of a 
collapsed erector set over the Hollywood Freeway that won the West Coast 
Gateway competition, is hyped. 
</P>
<P>
Other designs included Dennis Hopper's overwrought house in Venice, fashioned 
by Brian Murphy, that already has garnered more publicity than his last movie. 
There also were the usual unusual restaurants, studios and stores arbitrarily 
combining construction materials in strained attempts at architectural 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that some of the funky, punky structures featured are not 
fun, or at least interesting to consider, displaying as they do the latest in 
architectural fads and fashions, and quick tricks. 
</P>
<P>
But stepping back from these concoctions, which are being hailed as "new models 
for tomorrow's metropolis," I sense, as does Lautner, that they make more of a 
statement about merchandising than architecture. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, those designer homes in the Hollywood Hills, the upscale shops 
along Melrose Avenue and the Santa Monica restaurants-of-the moment cater to a 
fraction of the population, while most others look on, their noses pressed 
against the window. 
</P>
<P>
To me there is something very surreal about it all -- a West Coast Gotham City 
with a growing gap between the haves and have-nots expressed in a narcissistic 
design that not even Batman as architect could reform. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question also that, as Lautner contends, too much attention is paid 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is publications driven by the merchandisers or architects driven by 
their artistic egos that has sketched this sorry public image of the profession 
is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the legitimate social concerns of architecture, and the good 
works of many architects, to create a better, more habitable, attractive world, 
appear to be out of style, fad and fashion.

<P>
Attorney Bruss unfortunately was misleading in one important respect. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, the reader was advised to "hold title in joint tenancy with 
right of survivorship." While this may be preferable in most cases to holding 
title to a home or other real estate as separate property in the name of the 
husband or wife alone, it is usually recommended that a husband and wife take 
title to property as community property, rather than as joint tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The article also failed to mention one of the biggest advantages of a living 
trust, the ability to reduce or eliminate estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
STEPHEN C. CLARK 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Bruss replies: Attorney Stephen Clark is probably unaware of IRS 
Revenue Ruling 87-98, which states that even if the title is held in joint 
tenancy, if the joint tenants acknowledge in writing that the property is 
community property, then the IRS will give it a new basis stepped up to market 
value on the date of the first spouse's death. Contrary to popular belief, the 
revenue ruling says that in community property states, it is no longer 
neccessary to hold title as community property, if the joint tenants have 
acknowledged in writing that their realty is community property.

NEUSCHATZ MEMORIAL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am an infrequent reader of the Real Estate Section of the L.A. Times since I 
cannot imagine being able to afford "upgrading" from my condo in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
However, for some reason I opened that section this morning to find Sam Hall 
Kaplan's wonderful column on my dear friend Royce Schaffer Neuschatz (July 23). 
</P>
<P>
I, too, was at the memorial for Royce and when I went hiking yesterday in 
Griffith Park with the Sierra Club, I saw the old zoo picnic area and 
immediately thought of her. I began telling my "hike mate" of this terrific 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan's idea is most fitting for Royce and I think she would heartily endorse 
it. As Kaplan requested, I will contact the commission directly with my 
support.

LAWYERS AND TRUSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Bruss has overstepped his subject matter in his article "A Living 
Trust Will Help You To Avoid Probate" (July 23). 
</P>
<P>
He states that "Many lawyers hate living trusts because then the attorney can't 
collect probate fees." This implies that many of those professionals who are 
necessary to implement the assistance may not do so. In terms of discrediting 
the legal profession, Bruss might just as well have said that "many lawyers 
hate clients in good health because it delays the collection of probate fees." 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer must do what is most beneficial for the client and must find 
satisfaction in that endeavor. Being a lawyer, Bruss should know that in cases 
where a living trust would be most beneficial, lawyers have the additional task 
of overcoming the client's resistance or hesitancy due to the cost of the trust 
documents (in addition to the cost of the will, which is still necessary) and 
to the time and effort required of the client to promptly "fund" the trust by 
transferring all of his or her assets into the trust in order to avoid probate.

SAVING THE PAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just two days after the fire that crippled the Pan Pacific Auditorium I gave a 
lecture about the loss of the Pan. Everybody was aware of its historical 
significance and saddened by the event. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, I have talked to many other people about this building and it seems 
that no matter how uninformed a person may be about the architecture or history 
of Los Angeles, I have not run into anyone who was not aware of the Pan. People 
have told me stories about events they attended there over the years or just 
that they enjoyed seeing it stand there. Certainly it was a significant 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed Sam Hall Kaplan's column (June 18). It expressed so eloquently many 
of the feelings I have about the building. I hope he will continue to support 
the regeneration of this architectural treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Please do everything you can to save this precious piece of art from 
extinction.

BARE FEET AND BUTTERCUPS IN MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thelma Medendorp recalled the trauma of the 1933 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Gribble and Harry Herron spoke about how they went barefoot without the 
worry of burning their feet on sidewalks or asphalt streets -- because there 
weren't any in the early 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going Sliding 
</P>
<P>
Emily Dixon Lambert told of using sheets of tin to slide down a hill of 
buttercups. 
</P>
<P>
These were the days when the automobile was just beginning to make its 
appearance in the San Gabriel Valley. This was a time before there was a Hong 
Kong Supermarket and before you could get dim sum or shark fin soup on Atlantic 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time, Lambert said, "when you knew all your neighbors." Social life 
revolved around watching Tom Mix or Clara Bow movies at the Monterey Park 
Theater. A PTA meeting, a potluck at the Methodist Church, or rubber-necking 
while Hollywood film crews made a movie with the likes of Rudolph Valentino 
were big events. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an oral history project begun in 1984, the Monterey Park Historical 
Society has so far recorded the recollections of 13 longtime residents of the 
western San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The project focuses on Monterey Park, but the portrait is a universal one of 
Southern California in the early decades of the 20th Century, when suburbs 
emerged from the orange groves, walnut groves and chicken ranches. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Paine, the principal interviewer and coordinator of the project, has 
elicited memories of World War I, World War II, the Great Depression and the 
subdivision booms of the 1920s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
People told him stories of emigrations from the plains of the Midwest and from 
the countries of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There were few Latinos or Asians in this resettling. The Anglos' tales of those 
days, however, are somewhat similar to those of recent Latin American and Asian 
newcomers, who have transformed the look and feel of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Interviews 
</P>
<P>
Paine hopes to expand the project and perhaps obtain a grant to interview the 
new Asian immigrants. But first, he said, he has about 30 more longtime 
residents to interview. 
</P>
<P>
Paine, 76, retired in 1973 as a journalism and public relations professor at 
East Los Angeles College. He became interested in Monterey Park history during 
the 1970s, when Eli Isenberg, then the publisher of the local weekly newspaper 
the Monterey Park Progress, asked him to write about the origins of street 
names. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Monterey Park Historical Society gave Paine an honorary 
membership, and he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
The most shocking stories that Paine heard, he said, were of City Hall 
corruption. "Every once in a while, something crops up that indicates some 
council members or city officials weren't quite living by the rules," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The late Cliff Ostler, who worked at City Hall for 35 years in the Public Works 
and Building departments, told Paine about an official, now dead, who bragged 
about taking bribes of 10% to 15% of a project's value. "I don't think he'd 
take more than that," Ostler said, "but what he'd take would be at least 15%. 
When there was an argument or discussion, he'd take (from either) side -- the 
one that would pay the most." 
</P>
<P>
Paine also got longtime Monterey Park Lions Club member Kenny Gribble to talk 
about the 1951 origins of White Cane Days, when lapel pins shaped like canes 
are sold to raise money for the Lions' charitable work with the blind. The 
event expanded from Monterey Park into a nationwide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
And another Lions Club story emerged from the recollections: young Richard 
Nixon, as a Lion in Whittier, sometimes would stop by for a visit with the 
Monterey Park group. 
</P>
<P>
HARRY HERRON, 74 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew up in Wilmar, known today as South San Gabriel. Now lives in 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead. Family came to the San Gabriel Valley from Texas in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When we left El Paso, it was still wintertime in March. All the trees were bare 
and brown. It was constantly raining. We had hard winds and some snow. 
</P>
<P>
We came across the desert in California and we could see the Salton Sea, way to 
the west. It was very warm. And when we got to Pomona, it was just getting 
dark. There was a cool breeze, and we could smell the orange blossoms. We knew 
we were in California. There was greenery everywhere. Mustard weeds were five 
feet tall. Every place you looked you could see orange trees or walnut trees, 
heavily loaded. 
</P>
<P>
In El Paso, we had sidewalks, electricity, running water. But when we arrived 
here, the first thing I noticed when we walked into that little house in 
Wilmar, you could smell kerosene. Our cooking stove burned kerosene. The lamps 
were kerosene. We had to go outside to a water faucet, to bring water in. And 
we had nothing but outside plumbing. We had an outhouse about 60 feet from the 
house, down behind the garage. There was a big garden around it. It was two or 
three years before we had inside plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
When we first came here, we wore high-top shoes and long white stockings. All 
the boys wore short pants where we came from. We soon found that the boys here 
wore coveralls and went barefooted. My mother wouldn't hear of that. We weren't 
supposed to go barefooted until June. We found a place to hide our shoes, after 
we left the house to go to school in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THELMA MEDENDORP, 67 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born in Monterey Park in 1922. Her family had come in 1909, when her 
grandfather bought an acre in Ramona Acres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I remember clearly the Long Beach earthquake in March of 1933. It happened 
around 5 o'clock in the evening. It really did shake. Our table went clear 
across the room. I started to run out the back door, but the door wasn't there, 
the wall was. I hit my head and was knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
It really was a good shaker. Finally my father got me outside, and then I ran 
back inside to get my doll. I was scared my dolls were going to get hurt. The 
house next door caught afire, I remember, because they had a penny behind a 
fuse in the fuse box. I was shipped off to my aunt's house because my mother 
had a miscarriage when she ran outside, scared. We ran out of my aunt's house 
every five minutes it seemed, all night long during the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
We used to build Rose Bowl parade floats where Barnes Park is now. We'd have a 
tent there. Then we went to Pasadena early New Year's morning with the floats. 
One year some drunk guy ran into the back of our float while we were en route 
to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
We had to make sure all the flowers were in place after we got to Pasadena, 
because if you had one little bare place showing, you lost all your chances of 
winning. It was 2 o'clock in the morning when we were putting flowers on. By 
the time the parade would start, I was so sleepy, I'd just fall asleep and not 
even see the parade.

PHIL BROWNING, 77 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In 1914, two years after he was born in Los Angeles, his family (originally 
from Illinois) came to Ramona Acres, the name for the area that became the city 
of Monterey Park in 1916. He has operated a real estate business that his 
father started in 1922 in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As a boy, I'd take the Pacific Electric train to Pomona and visit my 
grandmother. From El Monte east, clear to Pomona, it was almost solid orange 
groves. There was very little habitation until you'd come to a little town like 
Covina or Glendora. Once you left the city limits, you were back in orange 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
We all had horses and bicycles. Most of the streets were dirt. Monterey Park's 
main street, Garvey, was so uninhabited by automobiles you could actually play 
in the street. 
</P>
<P>
When I was 20 and my brother was 22, we had this little hamburger stand from 
1932 to 1934. It was called Browning Brothers Hamburgers. We'd sell a huge 
hamburger for a dime, a cheeseburger for 15 cents, and a bowl of chili beans 
for 15 cents. We used to buy potato chips from Laura Scudder in a five-pound 
can, and they were the most beautiful potato chips one could imagine. (Laura 
Scudder started her potato chip company in Monterey Park in 1926.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the first sales I ever made in real estate, about 50 years ago, was a 
house for $1,500 on South Orange. The same house without any additions last 
week -- it is now April, 1989 -- sold for $150,000. An average size residential 
lot, that you could build a house on, would sell for $100,000 or more today. 
Back in '36, '38 and '40, I sold many lots for $250. You could buy a nice 
two-bedroom home with fireplace, hardwood floors, dining room, a single bath, 
double garage, on a lot 50 by 135, for $3,900.

EMILY DIXON LAMBERT, 78 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civic and community leader; former president, Monterey Park Historical Society. 
Resident since 1915. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
My dad came from England. My mother was born in Los Angeles. My dad was a 
cabinetmaker, and then he went to work for the Southern Pacific Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
They lived in Los Angeles, but the streetcar line was coming through where 
their house was, so they had to move. 
</P>
<P>
In the newspaper was a big article: "Go to the country." My dad got on the Red 
Car line. He got off where Mark Keppel High now stands. There was an old shed 
there, a real estate office. They took him in a Model T, drove over the hills 
and came to South Orange Avenue. There was an acre of ground. This acre had a 
beautiful stream running through it, and my dad said: "What an ideal place." He 
bought that acre for $600. 
</P>
<P>
While our house was being built, we took a trip to England and stayed there 
until the war began and we had to get home. So on January the 1st, 1915, we 
moved into this home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KENNY GRIBBLE, 79 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family came to Monterey Park from Nebraska in 1913, after stopping briefly in 
Oregon and Alhambra. Father ran a general store in Monterey Park. Gribble was a 
service station owner; has been mayor and City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I can remember bands of sheep going down Garvey Avenue. But I don't remember 
any sheep after 1918. The land had been subdivided, and there wasn't pasture 
for them any more. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a little kid, I don't suppose there were 20 automobiles in Monterey 
Park. The only way to go to Montebello was on a dirt road. There were no 
north-south roads in Monterey Park in the early days. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, in what now is south Monterey Park, people planted grain and 
harvested it to feed horses. There was a lot of hay raised and baled. We spent 
a lot of time in the hills. We hunted some. There were rabbits, birds, lots of 
doves. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey Dam (where the baseball field is in Garvey Ranch Park) was where I 
learned to swim. It's been filled in now. At one time it was 65 to 70 feet 
deep. The water was used to irrigate orchards and alfalfa fields. The water in 
that lake, Mr. Richard Garvey Sr. brought from way up north in Pasadena through 
a pipeline. He spent a fortune bringing in water.

SCHOOLS WIN FEDERAL GRANT FOR MAGNET AEROSPACE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach Unified School District has received a $3.1-million federal 
grant to create a magnet program in aerospace technology at seven city schools. 
</P>
<P>
The programs, which will be developed over the next year to start in the fall 
of 1990, will give about 2,500 students in grades four to 12 aerospace-oriented 
instruction in the physical sciences, engineering and computers. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that the U.S. ability to compete depends upon highly skilled 
students," Richard Van Der Laan, a district spokesman, said. "This is preparing 
for the future. It's very much in the national interest, and it's very much in 
the interest of students." 
</P>
<P>
Math and science curricula for students in the fourth through eighth grades 
will emphasize flight and space. High school students will have more vocational 
and specialized instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have youngsters who will have a reason to do well in math and 
science," Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant money will be used to train about 80 teachers, to upgrade science labs 
and to buy new computers and software, Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
The new magnet will be the largest of Long Beach's 36 magnet programs that are 
designed to improve education and racial balance in the schools, Van Der Laan 
said. This will be the first math and science-oriented magnet offered at 
several schools at once. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the district's magnet programs are based at just one school. Students 
will enter the aerospace program in elementary school so that they will have a 
stronger math and science background by the time they get to more specialized 
learning in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"You're building preparation into the success of high school students," Van Der 
Laan said. "They will develop a strong foundation at an early stage." 
</P>
<P>
The new program will be modeled after the Center for Aviation Technology, which 
was started last year at Lakewood High School, he said. A laboratory at 
Lakewood will be upgraded to include new computers, robotics and desk-top 
publishing. Students will be able to do realistic, computer-simulated 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it is like the Wright brothers," Van Der Laan said. "We've already 
gotten off the ground, but now we are headed for outer space." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lakewood, the program will include Buffum, Cleveland and Monroe 
elementary schools, Bancroft Junior High School and DeMille Middle School. A 
new elementary school, which does not yet have a name, is being built in Signal 
Hill and will be part of the program when it opens in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Of 180 school districts that applied for the grants, 53 received money, said 
David Eisner, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). The United 
States Department of Education and the Office of Civil Rights' Magnet Schools 
Assistance Program targeted $118 million for magnet schools nationwide, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, McDonnell Douglas, the Northrop Corp. and Rockwell International 
Corp. will help guide the program and train teachers, Van Der Laan said.

WESTSIDERS PLANT, HOE AND WEED IN COMMUNITY GARDENS; IN RETURN THEY REAP FRESH 
PRODUCE, FLOWERS AND SOMETHING EVEN BETTER: PEACE AND QUIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by a housing project, perched below a historic mansion, across a 
hillside overlooking Santa Monica Airport or on a busy street opposite a 
massage school, patches of earth burst forth with six-foot-tall corn and 
scarlet tomatoes, and the sweet smell of roses and herbs fills the air. 
</P>
<P>
They're the product and the pride of their fastidious caretakers, Westside 
residents who come to stoop over them, tug at weeds, and churn the soil with 
hoes and rakes. 
</P>
<P>
The parcels are community gardens, managed by cities and by nonprofit groups. 
For several hours a week of weeding and watering and for a low fee or no fee at 
all, they provide their gardeners fresh produce year-round, savings on grocery 
bills, and respite from the stress of living and working in a metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Biggest Bargain' 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest bargain in the world," said Herschel Burke Gilbert, president 
of Metropolitan Neighborhood Gardens and Farms Inc. (Metro Farms), a nonprofit 
group that oversees four gardens on the Westside and 11 elsewhere in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I read a lot of things all week long which are kind of sad -- so I have to get 
away from it," Mickey Engle, a medical records clerk and doctor's assistant, 
said on a recent Saturday at Ocean View Farms in Mar Vista. She was wearing 
soil-stained white tennis shoes and a straw hat, and a grapefruit-size tomato 
was perched on her fence. Gardening on Saturdays and one night during the week 
"gives me therapy, away from all those sick people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica and Culver City operate gardens on city land, and West Hollywood 
leases a plot from a private landowner. Metro Farms and the Common Ground 
Garden Program, another nonprofit group, lease public and private land. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the leased land is obtained for free, but the property owners 
benefit because the lessees provide liability insurance, trash collection and 
weed control, said Rachel Surls, community outreach coordinator of Common 
Ground, a 12-year-old program of the University of California Cooperative 
Extension that starts gardens in low-income neighborhoods. It sponsors one 
garden on Crenshaw Boulevard and one in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project. 
</P>
<P>
If landowners have vacant lots they plan to keep vacant for a while, "they'll 
save some money on it, and it's good community relations," Surls said. "It's 
going to turn probably from a trashy, vermin-infested lot with kids hanging out 
. . . into something beautiful and nice for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Among the gardens affiliated with Metro Farms are Ocean View and one in Wattles 
Gardens Park in the Hollywood Hills, below Wattles Mansion and surrounded by 
avocado trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Victory Gardens' 
</P>
<P>
Community gardens have roots going back to at least World War I, and sprang up 
again in World War II, when food was in short supply and the federal government 
urged citizens to grow their own vegetables in "victory gardens." The 
Department of Agriculture and the Office of Civilian Defense published such 
manuals as "A Victory Gardener's Handbook on Insects and Diseases." 
</P>
<P>
Communal gardens were in style in the 1970s because of the environmental 
movement and the "back-to-the-land feelings people had," Surls said. Now, she 
said, they are cropping up once more because gardening is popular and people 
fear pesticides on their produce. There are at least 50 community gardens in 
Los Angeles County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much better and healthier" knowing how your vegetables grow, said 
Rosemary Channel, 30, pointing to her frilly, bright green lettuce at the Mar 
Vista Gardens housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The plots are also in demand by apartment and condominium dwellers. Culver 
City's garden, wedged between office bungalows for the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
and the Boy Scouts, accommodates "a lot of condo owners who have lost a place 
to dig," said Carolyn Cole, Culver City's secretary of community services. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, waiting lists have sprouted up at many gardens, with 15 people and 
more -- who should expect to wait anywhere from a few months to more than a 
year, officials said. Santa Monica has about 50 people waiting each year for 
the $18-a-year, 18-by-20-foot plots on Main Street and on Park Drive near 
Broadway, said Ramona Cicciarelli, who supervises the gardens. The wait can be 
as much as three to four years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some gardens, such as those in West Hollywood and at Mar Vista Gardens, charge 
the gardeners nothing, but most collect an annual fee of around $20 to cover 
trash collection, water, insurance and tools. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens come with their own sets of rules, such as limits on fences and 
pesticides, requirements on upkeep, and prohibitions on selling produce. 
</P>
<P>
At West Hollywood's triangular garden at San Vicente Boulevard and Norwich 
Drive, pumpkins and marijuana are forbidden, said garden manager Kamish Blume. 
"Pumpkins, because the city considers them an attractive nuisance -- kids jump 
over the fence and try to steal them. And marijuana, because it's illegal," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the green thumbs say they didn't start that way. "The first year up 
here was hysterical," recalled Barbara Schoenwetter, who has tilled at Ocean 
View since the seven-acre hillside at Centinela and Rose avenues opened 12 
years ago. "Everyone had a book -- 'How to Plant Vegetables.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accomplished Something' 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Craig, who lives in the Mar Vista Gardens project, grew up in North 
Carolina, where her mother had a bountiful garden. But to her, "getting up in 
the hot sun in summer to pick vegetables, and then (having) to can all night 
long" was unappealing. 
</P>
<P>
But Craig, 33, watched last summer when part of the project's trampled lawn was 
dug up to make way for 10 garden beds, and on the spur of the moment, she 
signed up. Now, she is a convert: "You get the thrill of seeing the first 
cucumber or tomato come out. You feel you've accomplished something." 
</P>
<P>
The gardeners say they're learning by trial and error. "Whatever we want, we 
plant it -- and it if doesn't come up, we know it's not the season," quipped 
Craig's neighbor, Valita Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
But grapefruit-size tomatoes, zucchini as big as your arm and fragrant roses 
such as Mr. Lincolns don't just happen. "Spiritually, it's rewarding to grow, 
but it's a lot of work," said Eleanor Flannery, 37, an office worker who spends 
more than 10 hours a week at Ocean View tending her summer eggplant, tomatoes 
and carrots. The payoff, she said, is the joy of sending tomatoes to her mother 
in Philadelphia and to friends in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Channel, 33, a soft-spoken Mar Vista Gardens resident who belonged to a 
gang in high school, said that his patch of collards, beets, turnips and 
watermelon -- and his job at a supermarket -- "keep me out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good hobby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens have blossomed from mere tracts of dirt and mulch into social 
centers. The gardening mothers at the housing project come out of the 
concrete-and-stucco apartment blocks to sit on the wooden edges of the beds, 
chat and swap vegetables. Their children come to play with ladybugs and hose 
the cucumbers and tomatoes and one another. At Ocean View, people showcase 
their produce at monthly potlucks on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Own Governments 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View and other gardens have developed their own governments. The 500-plot 
Ocean View has an elected board of directors, representatives for different 
sections of the hill, and a system for settling arguments about shade or 
leaning fences. Mailboxes, a bulletin board and a newsletter are needed to keep 
its gardeners informed. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered over the Westside as they are, the gardens reflect their gardeners. 
In the Crenshaw Boulevard garden managed by Common Ground are several rows of 
do ra ji, a bitter Korean root smaller than a carrot that is used in soups and 
salads. Nearby is a "black heritage" plot, in which Sherl Hopkins, Common 
Ground demonstration projects coordinator, pointed out sweet potatoes, okra, 
corn, sorghum, black-eyed peas, beets and several varieties of squash. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean View, eggplant is popular. Quince and loquat trees, raspberries, 
several varieties of roses, dill and majestic red cannas dot other parts of the 
tract. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are those who plant neither vegetables nor flowers. At Santa 
Monica's Main Street garden, across the street from a massage school and a 
French bakery, Klaus Rinke has devoted two plots to pots of cacti of all shapes 
and sizes. Rinke, who was admiring his estimated 500 plants on a weekday 
evening recently, said he buys pastry at the bakery every morning and then 
breakfasts among his cacti, some of which tower 10 feet tall. He returns in the 
evening as the sun goes down. 
</P>
<P>
A sculptor from Germany, Rinke, 50, said he likes cacti "because they're like 
sculpture." 
</P>
<P>
The gardens reflect their locales in other ways. At Ocean View, the biggest 
problem seems to be gophers. "You can watch a tomato plant or a cabbage just 
disappear from the ground," said garden master Jerry Elliott. When they 
devoured her yellow wax beans, gardener Mickey Engle said, "I almost cried." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Mar Vista Gardens, Robinson lamented the recent murder of the 
homemade scarecrow by gang members. They lifted it from its seven-foot-tall 
stake, "beat it to death" and spray-painted gang names across its chest, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilfering a Problem 
</P>
<P>
Pilfering, either by outsiders or other gardeners, is an occasional problem 
everywhere, but for all the troubles, the gardeners say the flavorful produce 
alone makes the effort worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, for example, was plucking mustard greens as she devised a menu: "Cook 
them with some salt pork, with salt and pepper, and onions. Let them cook down, 
make some corn bread, and you can have a barbecue!" 
</P>
<P>
As she picked, a burly youth sauntered past the project's garden, gestured to 
the foot-and-a-half-long cucumbers Carolyn Craig was holding, and said: "Excuse 
me -- you grew that here? That's good!" 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't think anything could grow -- (the garden is) by a playground, by 
the sidewalk, and people just walk up and down," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has planted onions, greens, spinach, cabbage, green beans, cucumbers, 
carrots, garlic and basil. "When we have company, we show it off," she said. 
She estimated that the garden saves her household about $80 a month in 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
And even the children have become fans of gardening. "I plant things, clean up, 
help pick up the papers," said Robinson's niece, Tiffany Beasley, 10, who added 
that watering was the most fun. She insisted that she likes spinach, lettuce 
and cucumbers, and that the taste is far superior to store-bought produce. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Channel Jr., 9, concurred, calling store vegetables "nasty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Haven for Souls 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, the gardens are a haven for tension-filled, smog-choked souls. At 
Ocean View, Elliott and Bob Eckert, lunching under umbrellas on a recent 
Saturday, were surrounded by roses, casaba gourds, eucalyptus- and mint-scented 
geraniums and squiggly, purplish ornamental kale in their plot at the top of 
the hill. The talk was of gophers. Cornstalks and cannas nearby waved in the 
breeze. "In the middle of a city like L.A., you've got this real wild world 
here," said Eckert, a Culver City condominium dweller and head of acquisitions 
at the UCLA library. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out in the garden and get peace and quiet," said Robinson at the Mar 
Vista housing project. "You don't get peace and quiet when you have eight kids 
in the house." 
</P>
<P>
To her, the garden is comforting, convenient and near-perfect. "If we're making 
tacos, we just go out and get tomatoes," she said. "I wish I could grow cheese 
and chickens out there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY GARDENS 
</P>
<P>
Here are major community gardens on the Westside and where to call for more 
information. Some, such as the West Hollywood and Mar Vista gardens, charge 
nothing to gardeners, but most collect an annual fee of about $20 to cover 
trash collection, water, insurance and tools.

NEW RULES HIT POLITICAL DONATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
LAWMAKERS AND DONORS GRAPPLE WITH PROP. 73

<P>
Confusion about new campaign contribution limits dampened fund raising by most 
Westside lawmakers in the first six months of this year as officeholders and 
special interests struggled to understand the new rules of the political game 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion, apparent in campaign finance reports filed in recent days, was 
compounded by a state appeals court decision at midweek that upheld a ban on 
all non-election-year fund raising by Assembly and Senate candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But even as politicians and campaign donors try to untangle the new rules, the 
latest finance reports show that some already have found loopholes and 
techniques to keep campaign contributions flowing in spite of restrictions 
imposed by Proposition 73, which voters approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Around Limits 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
Some real estate developers are skirting Proposition 73's limit of $1,000 on 
contributions by an individual to a single campaign by donating the maximum on 
behalf of themselves, their spouses, and family members. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming predictions that contribution limits would simply cause some special 
interests to split into smaller components, the reports show that labor and 
some business groups are making separate contributions at the statewide level 
and locally. The contributions of the AFL-CIO's big statewide Committee on 
Political Education, for example, are supplemented this year by donations from 
Los Angeles County COPE. 
</P>
<P>
And in response to Proposition 73's ban on transfers of funds from one 
candidate to another -- a provision designed to limit the clout of legislative 
leaders -- candidates are now instructing special-interest donors how to give. 
The new technique, says Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), is for leaders 
to "call the special interest and tell them who to give the money to. . . . 
Those who need it are going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Proposition 73, voters last year approved a competing campaign 
reform measure, Proposition 68, banning off-year fund raising entirely and 
setting strict limits on the total amount of special interest money that 
legislative candidates can receive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposition 68 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 68, sponsored by the public interest group Common Cause, was 
blocked from taking effect by the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
The commission ruled that it was superseded by Proposition 73, which received 
more votes. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that several key 
provisions of Proposition 68 were not in conflict with the other measure. The 
court's decision is expected to take effect in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
This will occur as politicians and contributors are still learning the details 
of Proposition 73, which took effect New Year's Day. The measure, sponsored by 
three legislators, imposed a $1,000 limit on individual contributions, a $2,500 
limit for small political action committee donations, and a $5,000 limit for 
larger, well-established political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
The contribution limits were based on fiscal years rather than calendar years. 
Campaign finance reports for the first six months of 1989 -- the last half of 
the 1988-89 fiscal year -- show a flood of special interest contributions to 
Westside lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Gold Rush 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw was a gold rush in the last few months of the fiscal year," said 
Walter Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause. He said lawmakers 
now are free to tap the same sources again in the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said campaign contributors were confused initially about the new rules, 
but then jumped into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign contribution reports of some lawmakers are filled with pages of 
late June contributions from Sacramento-based lobbying groups. 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions, doctors, hospitals, bankers, horse racing interests, developers, 
trial lawyers, insurance companies, garbage haulers, utilities, chiropractors, 
wine producers and brewers appear often in the most recent campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Fund Raising 
</P>
<P>
Zelman predicted "massive special-interest fund raising in the next 30 days" 
before the ban on non-election year fund-raising imposed by Proposition 68 
takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
One key legislative aide, speaking on condition that he not be identified, 
predicted that printing presses in the state capital will be working overtime 
producing invitations to hastily arranged fund-raising events if the court 
decision stands. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months under Proposition 73, fund raising by Westside 
lawmakers generally failed to match the same off-year period two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Rosenthal, however, predicted that the decline will be only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't know what they could or should do," Rosenthal said in an 
interview. "It took a while before special interests created (new) PACs," or 
political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ways Around the Limit 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal suggested that lawmakers and special interests have been looking for 
and finding ways around Proposition 73's contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 also banned all transfers of contributions from one candidate to 
another. To get around the ban, Rosenthal, whose solidly Democratic district 
provides a safe seat, said he already has told special interest groups to make 
their contributions directly to other candidates rather than to him. 
</P>
<P>
The sharpest drop in fund raising by a Westside lawmaker was reported by Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) who raised $292,999 between 
Jan. 1 and June 30, down from a total of $1.3 million collected by four 
campaign committees two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roberti, Roos, Hayden 
</P>
<P>
The decline can be explained in part by the fact that Roberti was heavily 
involved in financing a Senate special election campaign in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Senate leader, Assembly Majority Leader Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) 
saw his fund raising soar from $42,540 in the first half of 1987 to $263,175 in 
the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, who like many legislators is on vacation during the Legislature's summer 
recess, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), reported receipts of $43,577 in the 
January to June period, down from $70,951 in the same period two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Hayden's main campaign committee reported raising $58,000 from the 
"sale of an asset," namely, 11 copies of an Andy Warhol portrait of his wife, 
actress Jane Fonda. The campaign spent $600 to advertise the print sale in a 
Japanese magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Required to File 
</P>
<P>
The reports do not show any fund raising by a committee that is exploring 
prospects for Hayden to run for state Insurance Commissioner next year. 
Spokesman Bill Schulz said the assemblyman "raised no money" for a statewide 
race and therefore is not required to file anything at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) collected $14,650 in the first 
half of 1989, down from $98,791 in the same period two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The story was the same for Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) who also 
raised $14,650 in the Jan. 1 to June 30 period, down from $94,369. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) raised $51,850, up slightly from the 
$49,100 she received in the first half of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood) raised $208,470 and 
spent most of it on a special election in February to win the seat long held by 
his late father. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Rosenthal reported raising $77,152 in the first half of this year, down 
from $185,306 two years earlier. Rosenthal had a simple explanation for the 
drop: he didn't hold a fund-raiser because he's not up for reelection until 
1992. 
</P>

CAMPAIGN FUND RAISING 
</P>
<P>
Here are the amounts raised by Westside legislators during the latest reporting 
period, Jan. 1 to June 30, compared to their totals for the corresponding 
period in 1987, the previous non-election year.

WESTWOOD ART SHOW FALLS VICTIM TO ITS SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of merchants and homeowners have apparently succeeded in ejecting the 
long-running Westwood Art Show from the streets of Westwood Village, 
maintaining that the popular event has deteriorated into a tacky bazaar that 
draws too many of the wrong kind of customers to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we're the orphan kids who've been kicked out in the rain," said 
Dori Pye, founder of the Los Angeles Business Council, which sponsors the 
event. "They're trying to supplant a 20-year tradition . . . an institution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Home 
</P>
<P>
Pye said the art show is looking for a new home, possibly Westwood Park, next 
to the Federal Building parking lot, south of Wilshire. "It's outrageous the 
merchants have been able to garner the support to push us out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the final decision will be made by the Los Angeles Board of Public 
Works, the deed is as good as done, both sides agree. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the art show, which is held for one weekend each spring and fall, 
was first mounted 20 years ago to help merchants draw customers to the village. 
</P>
<P>
It has succeeded too well, the merchants say. In recent years, the show has 
attracted from 30,000 to 40,000 people a weekend, a crowd that merchants and 
homeowners view as an unprofitable invasion that offers nothing in return to 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the dispute is dissatisfaction among merchants and community 
activists that the proceeds of the art show fill the coffers of the citywide 
business council, rather than financing improvements in Westwood Village. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants' main complaint, however, is that their regular weekend customers 
are thwarted by closed streets and throngs of people who might help fast-food 
businesses but who do not patronize their own upscale stores. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Silvers, manager of Bel Air Camera, said his store can lose $15,000 in 
business on an art-show weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the show has burgeoned from an exhibit of paintings to several 
hundred booths, featuring a wide variety of arts and crafts -- and, to some 
critics -- a lot of junk. 
</P>
<P>
"The art show today is not the same as it was 15 years ago," Silvers said. 
"Today it's more like selling belts in the street. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Regberg, director of the Westwood Merchants Assn., said it makes no sense 
to close down "one of the world's great shopping centers to bring in a lot of 
junk jewelry" sold by "Venice Beach-type vendors." 
</P>
<P>
Such a "circus atmosphere" is not in keeping with the image that the merchants 
want to project, Regberg said. "We felt it was just a bad reflection on the 
commercial district." 
</P>
<P>
The Holmby-Westwood Property Owners Assn., also dissatisfied with the tenor of 
the art show, was instrumental in galvanizing the merchants to demand changes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not classy," said community activist Laura Lake, president of Friends of 
Westwood. "We want to see class activities in Westwood Village. We don't want 
to see honky-tonk." 
</P>
<P>
But the real loser, said one artist, will be the community at large. "Because 
of the argument between the merchants and the council, the people are going to 
be deprived of the show," said portrait photographer Gayla Hachenberger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sure Victory 
</P>
<P>
The merchants appear certain to prevail, because a majority of those affected 
have to agree to an event that closes public streets, said Ed Avila, president 
of Los Angeles Public Works Board. "I don't believe (a property owner) would be 
too happy with us if we decided to close the streets, have a fair and said, 'We 
don't care what you think,' " Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
Regberg said the merchants' decision to no longer tolerate the Westwood Art 
Show in the Village followed years of grumbling and a year's effort to work 
with the show's sponsors on scaling down the event and providing enough 
restrooms and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Avila got involved when the Los Angeles Business Council filed for permits to 
close the streets for the May show, and the merchants balked. 
</P>
<P>
Following standard procedure in such controversies, Avila assigned a board 
member -- in this case himself -- to monitor the May show. Avila said he found 
significant problems of non-compliance with fire-lane regulations, 
overcrowding, and violations of other city rules. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the recommendation of the board member who studied the matter is 
likely to be adopted by the full board. But Avila insists no final decision has 
been reached. Because of the problems, however, "it doesn't look good," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Avila stressed that he is not out to squelch the community event, only to 
harness it in the face of strong community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants, too, said they were not against the Westwood Art Show -- if it were 
done differently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Felt Ignored 
</P>
<P>
"My first preference would have been to upgrade the show and make it a great 
show," said Tim Hall, owner of Alice's Restaurant, who said his business does 
not suffer from the influx of art-show attendees. Hall said a lot of merchants 
were angry that their objections weren't addressed at the May show. 
</P>
<P>
He said that show's sponsors underestimated the opposition and did not take it 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants and homeowners charge that the show's estimated annual profit of 
$50,000 to $70,000 is not funneled back into the community by the business 
council, for which the show is a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scanlon, owner of the food market Breadstiks and two other Westwood 
Village businesses, said the business council has a citywide base and that 
"none of the profits is returned to the village" for planters or other 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants got 10% of the proceeds from the show's sponsors in May, and used 
the money for Westwood's upcoming 60th anniversary and for other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The business council provided a list of community benefits they paid for over 
the years, including Westwood Village police foot patrols and the paving of a 
parking lot. The list does not specify when the donations were made. 
</P>
<P>
Pye, a longtime force in business and political circles, said she disagrees 
with those who want the show to be strictly upscale. Knickknacks that everyone 
can afford are part of the fun of the street fair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She is also skeptical of business owners' claims that they do not benefit 
financially from the influx of people to the art show. "Thirty- to 40,000 
people aren't going to shop, buy food or yogurt?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
But even those businesses that make money say the revenue doesn't compensate 
for the hassles involved when a mob of people needing parking places, restrooms 
and trash cans descend on the area. 
</P>
<P>
That's what already happens to the once-sleepy village every weekend night, and 
the merchant group, Regberg says, is unwilling to let the night crowd impinge 
on the day scene, even for four days a year.

section of Eucalyptus Avenue in Bellflower is a "marketplace for drugs," 25 
sheriff's deputies recently raided two apartment buildings, arrested 33 people, 
including four juveniles, and seized cocaine worth about $1,200, said Sgt.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stealth Bomber 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 257 to 160 to keep the Stealth bomber program alive next fiscal 
year, but on a much leaner budget than President Bush wants and under 
congressional quality controls seen as excessive by many advocates of the 
futuristic warplane. The amendment was added to the $305-billion defense 
authorization bill for fiscal 1990 that later was sent to conference with the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to elude enemy radar and reach targets deep within Soviet territory, 
the nuclear-equipped Stealth, or B-2, would become the new air leg of America's 
air-land-sea "triad" strategy for deterring nuclear war with the Soviets. Each 
plane would cost upwards of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment calls for Congress to appropriate $3.7 billion for Stealth 
research and production next year rather than the $4.7 billion sought by the 
Pentagon, permits only two planes to be built next year rather than the five 
the Administration wants assembled and imposes performance standards on the 
unproven Stealth technology. But the amendment puts production on hold until 
the Administration devises and Congress accepts a scaled-back version of the 
Air Force's present plan to build 132 planes at a cost of $70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

SDI Funding 
</P>
<P>
By a 248-175 vote, the House lowered funding for the proposed Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) anti-missile shield by $700 million next fiscal year. That 
reduction combined with an earlier cut in the House Armed Services Committee 
pared President Bush's fiscal 1990 request for SDI from $4.8 billion to $3.1 
billion. The research and development money is contained in the 1990 military 
spending bill (see previous votes). 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to cut SDI funding.

MUSICAL MURAL TAKES THE PLACE OF GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inch by inch and stroke by stroke, artists are transforming a wall behind the 
George Washington Middle School in Long Beach into a colorful mural titled 
"Community of Music." The muralists, brothers Ben and Art Valenzuela of 
Artesia, have been at work on the painting since April. 
</P>
<P>
At left, Art Valenzuela mixes his colors; below, Ben touches up details of a 
face. They say the mural, at Cedar Avenue and 15th Street, should be completed 
in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Three of their assistants are from the Mural Mentor Program, a Long Beach city 
project that hires community youths to work on murals. At the end of the summer 
the youths will have an opportunity to paint their own murals in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Thys, Long Beach Development Project manager, who oversees the program, 
said the murals are an alternative to graffiti. "This is a positive way to make 
a statement in their neighborhoods," he said.

Stealth Bomber 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 257 to 160 to keep the Stealth bomber program alive next fiscal 
year, but on a much leaner budget than President Bush wants and under 
congressional quality controls seen as excessive by many advocates of the 
futuristic warplane. The amendment was added to the $305-billion defense 
authorization bill for fiscal 1990 that later was sent to conference with the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to elude enemy radar and reach targets deep within Soviet territory, 
the nuclear-equipped Stealth, or B-2, would become the new air leg of America's 
air-land-sea "triad" strategy for deterring nuclear war with the Soviets. Each 
plane would cost upwards of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment calls for Congress to appropriate $3.7 billion for Stealth 
research and production next year rather than the $4.7 billion sought by the 
Pentagon, permits only two planes to be built next year rather than the five 
the Administration wants assembled and imposes performance standards on the 
unproven Stealth technology. But the amendment puts production on hold until 
the Administration devises and Congress accepts a scaled-back version of the 
Air Force's present plan to build 132 planes at a cost of $70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

SDI Funding 
</P>
<P>
By a 248-175 vote, the House lowered funding for the proposed Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) anti-missile shield by $700 million next fiscal year. That 
reduction combined with an earlier cut in the House Armed Services Committee 
pared President Bush's fiscal 1990 request for SDI from $4.8 billion to $3.1 
billion. The research and development money is contained in the 1990 military 
spending bill (see previous votes). 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to cut SDI funding.

NEW POLICY SEEKS TO HELP MOTHERS IN PRISON RELATE TO CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA MEARS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you asked Jenny Martinez, "Have you hugged your kid today?" she'd laugh you 
right out of the room. Even though she's the mother of three, with another on 
the way, the room is a cell at the Ventura County Honor Farm in Ojai, where the 
bumper-sticker question is just an ironic joke. 
</P>
<P>
Hugging their kids is not something most women in jail are allowed to do. 
Traditionally, the policy has been "look but don't touch," and it is enforced 
in most facilities throughout the state by a physical separation: screens, 
glass or fencing. At Ojai, one visiting room is equipped with Plexiglas and 
another with a wood partition, depending on the prisoner's potential for 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will Martinez tell you that she has not hugged her children today or 
yesterday or last month, she will tell you that under the circumstances, she 
does not want to see them, even for the 30-minute visitations allowed once 
every two weeks. "The visits aren't good," she said. "If I can't touch them and 
hold them, I'd rather not see them at all." 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Rivas, a former cellmate who was released in late July, seconds that 
emotion. A mother of three children ranging in age from 9 months to 4 years, 
the 21-year-old Rivas said: "It's very hard. What do you say to little ones 
that they'll understand? They don't understand why you can't hold them. It's 
just too hard." 
</P>
<P>
State and local corrections officials hope a recently approved program will 
ease such concerns and help break the cycle of addiction and crime that lands 
the women in jail to begin with. The program -- called Teaching and Loving Kids 
(TALK) -- is designed to help incarcerated mothers more constructively relate 
to their children. It tears down the partitions between mothers and children, 
expands visiting time to 90 minutes and offers a supervised array of activities 
more reminiscent of playtime than of hard time. 
</P>
<P>
At the handful of other California jails and prisons using the TALK program, 
activity areas are set up with a variety of blocks, easels, drawing and 
chalkboards, clay, dolls, beads for stringing and play areas for dress-up and 
tea parties. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers are instructed not just to watch, but to play, not to ask 
value-judgment questions ("Are you being good? Are you doing well in school?") 
and, of course, to hug. 
</P>
<P>
Such a session concludes with a group game called "parachute," in which the 
children grab the edges of a large circle of fabric, lift it in the air while 
their mothers run underneath, and then bring it down, covering the inmates. 
Then the situation reverses: The mothers do the lifting while the children lie 
giggling under the big parachute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liked by Inmates 
</P>
<P>
TALK was popular with inmates when it was first offered as a pilot program in 
1987 at the Mira Loma women's facility in Los Angeles County. Ventura County 
officials also have high hopes for it. They are waiting for the arrival of 
specially equipped trailers in October to start it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you right now, our inmate mothers will love it," said Sgt. Kelli 
McIlvain, a supervisor at the Ojai facility, where perhaps 80% of the 190 
female inmates are mothers. "It could make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Corrections spokesman Mike Van Winkle said 85 of 105 
inmates who participated in the department's prison-mother-infant program in 
1987 were successful -- success being defined as good behavior with no rule 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't yet look at a success rate after they have been paroled. It's too 
soon and the sample size is very small. But we expect success because we choose 
people for the program who can benefit most and who can meet the criteria," Van 
Winkle said. "We have a waiting list of prisoner-mothers waiting to get into 
this program. It helps keep them on the straight and narrow. Is there a bigger 
incentive for a mother than her children?" 
</P>
<P>
To many inmates, the answer is not so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vicious circle," said the diminutive and soft-spoken Rivas, who was 
jailed for heroin use. "That drug comes first and your priority is taking care 
of yourself. It's very selfish." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, whose fourth child is due in September, said matter-of-factly: "Let's 
be realistic -- our kids do not come first. We do not do what we're supposed to 
do. I don't play the part with the crying stuff and how bad I feel for my kids 
because I know I'll be right back." 
</P>
<P>
The children of Martinez, who also was jailed for drug violations, and Rivas 
are being cared for by family members who have been awarded temporary custody 
by the county's Public Social Services Agency. But having their children 
removed permanently is always a possibility. "If you don't have family support, 
you're a goner," said one inmate. 
</P>
<P>
While inmate mothers retain the right to arrange for their children's care, 
courts can place the children into permanent foster care if the mothers are 
ruled unfit. And even the most skeptical inmates admit that if anything can 
scare them straight, it is the prospect of losing their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Living 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared, I'm real scared," whispered Rivas. "I don't want to mess up 
again." Although Rivas' mother cared for her children while she was jailed, she 
knows that can change if she is arrested again. And there may come a time when 
her mother is not considered physically able to care for three children. "They 
take your kids away, then tell you to get a job, and that's supposed to be your 
reason for living?" 
</P>
<P>
To some, more legitimate reasons for living exist behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
At least for awhile, the women are sober and drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
As Jenny Martinez observed: "We come in here like the walking dead, and we come 
out looking great, brand new! Sometimes I think the police don't arrest us, 
they rescue us." 
</P>
<P>
They go to substance-abuse workshops; they are tutored by a group of volunteer 
retired teachers called Roots and Wings. They work in the fields tending crops. 
</P>
<P>
And, after an average stay of 90 days, they get out. 
</P>
<P>
Then, said Martinez, it's the same old story. "Maybe one of every 10 get off 
this wheel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvain, an 18-year Sheriff's Department veteran, agreed with Martinez's 
gloomy assessment. McIlvain said she sees the same faces year after year -- 
women who got involved with drugs and alcohol early on and dropped out of 
school, with no skills or money. More often than not, they ended up involved in 
petty crimes to support themselves and their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it becomes a pattern, a cycle, that few seem to be able to break out of," 
McIlvain said. "If we can provide any impetus for these women with a program 
like TALK, we want to do it."

A burglar dubbed "The Weasel" has been pilfering canned food, flashlights and 
toilet paper from cabins in the Diablo Range that borders Stanislaus and Santa 
Clara counties. "It sounds like a . . . person up there is stealing what he 
needs to survive," Stanislaus County Sheriff's Capt. Les Weidman said. The 
burglar, who's been seen several times, has broken into more than 30 cabins 
over the last four months.

The National Women's Political Caucus will concentrate next year on electing 
abortion-rights candidates in key states across the nation, the group's leader 
said. The campaign, called "Empower America," will target races in Oregon, 
Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio, North Carolina, 
Maryland and Delaware, caucus chairwoman Irene Natividad said at the 
organization's annual convention in St. Paul, Minn. "We are the pro-choice foot 
soldiers in the electoral trenches of this country," Natividad told 1,200 
delegates and guests. "They say we have not yet proven that women vote as a 
bloc. Well, let me tell you, that is going to change." Actress Cybill Shepherd 
and former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Mary Louise Smith also 
addressed the organization of female politicians.

Two Palestinian prisoners at a desert detention camp were stabbed to death by 
other political detainees, the Israeli army said. It was not clear if the 
slayings were politically motivated. An army spokesman said the bodies were 
discovered during a count of prisoners at the Ketziot Detention Center. "They 
were killed by fellow inmates," an army spokesman said. Palestinian inmates 
have killed several other detainees accused of collaborating with Israeli 
authorities in the Negev Desert camp, which holds Palestinians in connection 
with the uprising against Israeli control of the occupied territories.

Nuclear accidents caused mainly by careless handling of radioactive materials 
killed 20 people and injured 1,200 in China from 1980 to 1985, an official 
report said. Luo Guozhen of the State Environmental Protection Bureau said 
China needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and other radioactive 
materials, the China Daily newspaper reported. China is building two nuclear 
power plants. Most of its nuclear waste so far has been generated by the 
military, but growing amounts are being produced in laboratories, hospitals and 
non-military industries.

The Kremlin painted a gloomy picture of the Soviet economy, with a national 
debt of nearly $500 billion -- one that is also growing faster than that of the 
United States. The assessment came in a speech by State Planning Committee 
chairman Yuri D. Maslyukov before the Supreme Soviet, or legislature, which is 
to consider the 1990 budget during a session that begins Sept. 26. Inflationary 
pressures are growing, and the deficit for 1989 is now projected at $192 
billion, up 20% from estimates given six months ago. That is four times the 
U.S. budget deficit in terms of the economy's ability to adjust to it, Soviet 
officials said. The Soviet deficit amounts to 13.8% of all the country's goods 
and services produced in a year.

Thousands of mourners defied South African police to bury two African National 
Congress activists in a funeral that turned violent after more than four hours 
of tense confrontation. Police tolerated open defiance of orders forbidding 
political statements and banners at the funeral for black student activists 
Coline Williams, 22, and Robbie Waterwitch, 20. But the Rev. Richard O'Rourke 
said police used dozens of canisters of tear gas to break up the traditional 
post-funeral meal attended by about 500 people at St. Matthew's Catholic Church 
in Bonteheuvel, a mixed-race area outside Cape Town. Williams and Waterwitch 
died July 23 when a bomb they were handling exploded.

Federal agents arrested a state social services employee after discovering an 
elaborate indoor operation for growing marijuana in the suspect's Sacramento 
house, authorities said. Charged with illegal marijuana cultivation was Justin 
Wolf, 47, a child-care ombudsman for the state Department of Social Services, 
who was arrested Friday at his office. Federal agents and Sacramento County 
sheriff's deputies, who raided Wolf's house, found 65 plants in two rooms, said 
Charlie Stowell, a special agent for the federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration.

Crime across the nation jumped 3% last year -- rising to more than five 
offenses for every 100 U.S. residents -- with murder and rapes increasing more 
than cases of arson and theft, the FBI said. In its annual "Crime in the United 
States" report, the FBI compared figures to 1987 and showed the number of 
crimes known to law enforcement authorities was 17% higher than five years ago 
and 14% above the level a decade ago. Violent crime was up 6% overall from 
1987, with each offense in that category increasing. Property crime such as 
arson, larceny and motor vehicle theft climbed a slower 3%, and burglary 
declined slightly. An estimated 13.8 million arrests were made for all crimes 
other than traffic violations, a 1% increase from 1987, the FBI said. 
Authorities resolved 46% of the violent crimes.

reverence. Having come to Southern California from Oxford, Miss., I was 
dismayed to find that San Diego is sometimes a more redneck town than the one I 
left, especially on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
Here in San Diego, we stripped King's name from the street signs downtown. We 
waffled like crazy over affixing his name to the new Convention Center. Now 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor says she doesn't know what to do to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is clear and simple and elegant. We should name the proposed new 
main library "The Reverend Martin Luther King Library." The new library lobby 
will be the ideal place for a King memorial statue, and in the halls we can 
create a gallery of photographs and information on King and the civil rights 
years that will be seen by school children and library patrons through the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It is an appropriate tribute. King was a scholar who taught us the value of 
knowledge in the fight for freedom. Today, part of his legacy is equality in 
education for blacks and whites, and in the racial integration that allows us 
to use public places like libraries together in peace. 
</P>
<P>
I think naming a dirty downtown street for him was a token gesture. I know that 
trying to name a convention center for him was ridiculous. Let's do something 
right for a change. 
</P>
<P>
And yo, rednecks: this will get the liberals off your backs for good.

'GODDESS' STATUE DAMAGED BY VANDALS TO BE REPAIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The "Goddess of Democracy" statue in Chinatown, destroyed by vandals last week, 
got a new lease on life Saturday as the artists responsible for the crudely 
fashioned wood and plastic-foam monument gingerly gathered up its remains and 
took it in for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Tom Van Sant, who created the statue, said the goddess will emerge anew 
after spending about three weeks in the Santa Monica Canyon studios of the 
Artists Equity Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We built the first one for only $700, so I'm sure we can repair it for about 
the same amount of money," Van Sant said. "We may even make it stronger this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ropes Cut 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-pound statue, perched in front of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent 
Assn. headquarters on Broadway, was a replica of the one erected by Chinese 
students during mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tien An Mien 
Square in June. The original was destroyed when Chinese troops moved in and 
crushed the rebellion in a bloody crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The replica suffered a similar fate Monday when unknown vandals sliced through 
the ropes that anchored the 23-foot-tall monument to a building and toppled it. 
The goddess's head was severed in the fall and its foam torso splintered into 
dozens of pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant said some pieces may have to be replaced. Early Saturday morning, as 
he and Charles Sherman, president of the nonprofit Artists Equity Assn., loaded 
the statue onto the back of a flatbed truck, there remained signs of tension as 
two passers-by shielded their faces from television cameras and others kept 
their distance from the recovery work. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant said many Chinese-Americans fear reprisals against relatives in China. 
"People are still intimidated," the artist said. "That's why this sculpture is 
so important." 
</P>
<P>
No one can say where the goddess will go next. It came to Chinatown last month, 
receiving the red-carpet treatment from Chinatown civic leaders, after city 
officials evicted it from its Civic Center footbridge perch on grounds that it 
represented a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Get New Home 
</P>
<P>
Now a safer location may have to be found. Sherman noted that community leaders 
in Chinatown will have much to say about the statue's eventual resting place. 
There was no one from the Chinese-American community on hand Saturday as the 
statue was carted away, but Sherman said the Chinatown community has been very 
supportive of the artists' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant said he is not surprised that the goddess has had such a turbulent 
time of it. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't feel good," he said. "But it's understandable. We're dealing with 
a fight over people's rights. So I guess that we have to expect these types of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant hopes to eventually build a more permanent monument to the Chinese 
uprising. He is seeking $300,000 in private funding for a marble version of the 
goddess that will be offered to the people of China, though he does not expect 
the Communist government to accept it.

HER HONOR OF THE DESERT BENCH; 
</P>
<P>
MARGARET GRIGNON IS TOUGH, FAIR, ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEAGUES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is only one Superior Court judge in the Antelope Valley, a desert expanse 
of northern Los Angles County that is a tough blend of rural and urban 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Margaret M. Grignon, and she has a reputation for her own tough 
blend of legal diligence and scholarship. The first and only woman judge in the 
valley, she maintains a serene, almost gentle courtroom presence, even as she 
hands down sentences that some defense lawyers criticize as severe. 
</P>
<P>
But many prosecutors, public defenders and private attorneys say Grignon's 
ability supersedes ideology. They point out that lawyers in a recent death 
penalty case agreed to argue the case before Grignon (pronounced "Grin-yo") in 
a rare non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
"That indicates a tremendous level of respect for a judge," said Justice Armand 
Arabian of the State Court of Appeal, Grignon's longtime mentor. "That only 
happens when both sides have full faith in the judge. It is a badge of honor." 
</P>
<P>
Grignon ruled that medical negligence had contributed to the death of the 
victim but found the defendant guilty of murder and sentenced him to death. It 
was only the second time in California that the death penalty had been imposed 
after a non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion on that sentence appears split between prosecutors and defense 
attorneys. But regardless of where they stand, people who have worked with the 
38-year-old Grignon say her handling of the case demonstrates her willingness 
to take on challenges. 
</P>
<P>
There was doubt and resentment in the valley's insulated legal community in 
1984 when Gov. George Deukmejian appointed Grignon to the Antelope Valley 
Municipal Court. She was 34, a little-known tax lawyer and a newcomer with 
minimal courtroom experience and prominent allies such as Arabian, who swore 
her in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nobody Knew Her' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete surprise," one attorney recalled. "Nobody knew her. She 
wasn't part of the local old-boy network. A lot of people thought of her as a 
carpetbagger." 
</P>
<P>
The doubts have given way. 
</P>
<P>
"She came, she saw and she conquered," said valley defense attorney Eugene 
Siegel, who described himself as a liberal at the opposite end of the political 
spectrum from the judge. "She is one of the smartest, hardest-working judges I 
have appeared before." 
</P>
<P>
Grignon, her husband, James, a doctor, and their two children have lived in the 
valley for six years. She is a former director of the Antelope Valley Domestic 
Violence Council and recently cut down on her active public speaking schedule 
to spend more time with her family. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it up here," said Grignon, named Woman of the Year of the 34th Assembly 
District by legislators. "There is a real sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
Although critics are hard to find, some defense attorneys say Grignon's 
hard-line sentencing philosophy is in the tradition of other Deukmejian 
appointees and of her predecessors in the valley judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
She is like other "Republican right-wingers who believe everyone should be in 
jail," said longtime local attorney Dell Falls. "I think she is highly 
intelligent, affable and well-read. The only thing I can find wrong with her is 
that she's too heavy in sentencing." 
</P>
<P>
In relatively minor cases in which defendants have plea bargained to receive a 
sentence ranging from no jail time to 180 days, Grignon invariably imposes the 
maximum, several lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Common Sense' 
</P>
<P>
But she resists the label of rigid conservative, describing her philosophy as 
"common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel said: "She believes strongly in punishment as a mechanism to deter 
crime. However, that's tempered a little bit. She will step out of that role 
when appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney William A. Clark said: "She rarely gives a no-jail sentence. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Grignon said: "I think I follow the law. You would think a Superior Court judge 
would have a lot more discretion, but in fact what we do is based on 
determinate sentencing. If you apply the statutory parameters, you arrive at a 
sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Grignon said it was difficult to arrive at a sentence for James Scott of 
Palmdale, charged in the murder of a woman who died in February, 10 months 
after he raped her, beat her unconscious and set her bed afire. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Clark and Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent Cahill 
agreed to try the death penalty case before Grignon rather than before a jury. 
Clark thought it would be difficult for a jury to remain objective because of 
the horrible nature of the crime. Both he and Cahill said their confidence in 
Grignon played a role in their decisions to waive the right to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negligence Moot 
</P>
<P>
Grignon found Scott guilty in April. Clark requested a sentence of life 
imprisonment without parole, arguing that medical negligence contributed to the 
victim's death. But Grignon ruled during sentencing that aggravating factors, 
such as use of a deadly weapon, outweighed any medical negligence. She 
sentenced Scott to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"She had the power not to impose the death penalty," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Stephen L. Cooley, head of the Lancaster office. "She made the decision alone. 
It's a lot harder for one person to make. The fact that she followed the law 
does not mean that it was easy." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who continues to represent Scott on appeal, said he thought medical 
negligence played a greater role in the victim's death than Grignon 
acknowledged. But he said: "I don't think her imposition of the death penalty 
was inconsistent with her verdict and her view of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer in the public defender's office, who asked not to be named, was more 
critical of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the defense made a very valid showing," he said. "Once she found 
that the hospital was negligent, to blame the defendant for the death was 
inappropriate. . . . It shows she's not opposed to the death penalty and may 
feel it should be used more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Intellectual Exercise' 
</P>
<P>
Grignon said she thought Clark made the right move in opting for a non-jury 
trial because the case was an intellectual exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Of the death sentence, she said: "It was one of the hardest decisions I have 
made. I spent a lot of time, a lot of sleepless nights. Once it was made, the 
angst, the anxiety went away. That's what judges do. We bring things to a 
conclusion. You don't have to agonize after the decision because you have 
agonized before." 
</P>
<P>
The population and crime rate of the Antelope Valley have exploded during 
Grignon's tenure. Palmdale, the fastest-growing city in the state for the past 
three years, grew 17% last year, and Lancaster grew 10%. The number of reported 
crimes in the valley went up 35% during the first six months of this year, a 
per capita increase of 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Two Superior Court commissioners handle family, probate and juvenile cases 
while Grignon handles criminal and civil trials. A recent study of the workload 
at the courthouse found that two more judges are needed. The district 
attorney's office has filed more than 700 felony cases in Superior Court over 
the past year, compared to about 250 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said Grignon has improved the efficiency of the Superior Court and, 
previously, the Municipal Court, when she was presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Goal 
</P>
<P>
Grignon has her sights on a higher goal. She is among the applicants for the 
seat on the state Court of Appeal vacated by Justice Joyce Kennard, whom 
Deukmejian recently appointed to the state Supreme Court. Once the State Bar 
Assn.'s Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation has rated applicants, the 
final decision is up to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon was born in New Jersey, raised in Riverside and studied law at Loyola 
University Law School, where she graduated first in her class. After clerking 
for Justice Robert S. Thompson of the state Court of Appeal, an expert in tax 
law, she decided to pursue a specialty in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon later was the only woman in the tax departments of law firms in Los 
Angeles and San Diego. Then, and as a newcomer on the Antelope Valley bench, 
she said she has never been discriminated against because she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel much resentment," she said. "It was more a sense of 'Can she do 
it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Although the judgeship does not require the 70-hour workweeks of corporate 
practice, Grignon said: "It takes a toll. I have worked longer hours, but never 
where it has taken more out of me."

GANGS, DRUGS REAPPEAR ON BLYTHE STREET; 
</P>
<P>
OLD ENEMIES RETURN AFTER POLICE DISBAND TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The group of seven young men stood on the curb on Blythe Street in Panorama 
City, taking friendly jabs at one another, striking tough-guy poses and just 
waiting. One teen-ager even brought a kitchen chair, set it at the curb and sat 
back in the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
A new station wagon slowly made its way along the graffiti-marred block and 
stopped in front of the gathering. Two of the youths rushed to the car's 
windows and leaned in. Words were passed, then money. Change was handed back to 
the driver, along with a small bag of what appeared to be marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The station wagon headed off, and the young men went back to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
It has been less than four months since a Los Angeles Police Department task 
force that targeted the half-mile stretch of Blythe Street was disbanded, but 
police and residents say drug dealers and gangs are beginning to make a 
comeback in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Target 
</P>
<P>
From July, 1987, until May of this year, Blythe, from Van Nuys Boulevard to 
Brimfield Avenue, was the target of the 13-officer Narcotics Enforcement 
Detail, as well as a variety of neighborhood-improvement efforts by the city 
and apartment owners and residents. 
</P>
<P>
And by all accounts, the campaign was successful. The task force officers made 
more than 500 arrests. Drug dealers and gang members were forced off the curbs 
of the apartment-lined street, and the neighborhood lost its distinction as a 
drive-through drug market. 
</P>
<P>
"Blythe Street was pretty clean when we left," said Sgt. John Preston, one of 
the task force's supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
But like weeds cut down but not uprooted, drug peddlers once again await 
customers on the curbs along Blythe. The neighborhood is again marked with 
graffiti. And residents, who a year ago saw vast improvements, now say the 
neighborhood is sliding back. 
</P>
<P>
"Things got good here; now I think they are getting worse again," said a 
longtime resident who last year allowed the officers to use her apartment to 
secretly watch drug dealers. She asked not to be identified because she fears 
reprisals from gang members and drug peddlers. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up two, three times a night when I hear things, shots," she said. "In 
the day I see the boys on bikes, looking out for the drug dealers. I call the 
police so much they must know my voice. Soon it will be like there was no 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graffiti Removed 
</P>
<P>
While the NED unit was around, curbside parking was eliminated so police would 
have a clear view of the street, and most of the graffiti were removed by 
resident groups. 
</P>
<P>
Police gang and narcotics squads have increased patrols on Blythe since the 
task force was disbanded. But police concede that crime is on the increase in 
the neighborhood of mostly low-income families and new immigrants, many of whom 
live in crowded apartments and are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is getting kind of rough there again," said Sgt. Jim Flavin, in charge of 
an anti-gang unit that patrols Blythe. "When the NED guys pulled out, the gang 
guys pulled back in." 
</P>
<P>
David Combs, a manager of a Blythe Street apartment building, said gangs and 
drug dealers have boldly stepped forward in recent months to reclaim the 
street. He said gang members attempt to intimidate residents who want to clean 
up the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The gang members run this street," he said. "A lot of people are scared, and 
you can't blame them. It's a constant battle on Blythe Street. The Police 
Department does what it can, but the drug dealing and the gangs are all still 
here. The task force isn't." 
</P>
<P>
A visitor to the neighborhood is greeted by symbols of local gang members: 
8-foot-high letters -- BST -- are painted on the side wall of a furniture store 
at Blythe and Van Nuys Boulevard. The monogram, short for Blythe Street, is 
shared by two gangs that coexist in the neighborhood, the Dukes and the 
Cyclones. Graffiti -- slogans, nicknames, caricatures -- cover neighborhood 
walls and fences. Almost nothing is spared. 
</P>
<P>
Police could not provide crime statistics for the neighborhood -- departmental 
statistics are kept for a wider area. But there are other indications that 
crime is up. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still dealing on Blythe," said Sgt. Mario Mascolo, a supervisor of a 
Valley narcotics unit. "We go by there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Residents' complaints about crime routinely are called to Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi's office, said Irene Slater, a deputy for the councilman, whose 
district includes the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We constantly receive complaints about dope and gangs," she said. "You clean 
up the place, and they come right back in." 
</P>
<P>
Slater said she regularly visits Blythe Street to check on complaints and talk 
to residents and apartment managers about problems. She said young drug dealers 
often approach her car asking if she wants to buy marijuana. She keeps her car 
doors locked. 
</P>
<P>
In May, there was an attempted murder on Blythe, which police believe occurred 
when a motorist tried to "take the dime" from two drug dealers. Police said the 
motorist grabbed drugs from the dealers and sped off without paying. He drove 
to Willis Avenue but could not escape because of a concrete roadblock placed 
across Blythe by the city two years ago to discourage drive-through drug 
dealing. 
</P>
<P>
When the drug thief turned his car around and tried to drive past the dealers, 
police said, a steel pipe was hurled into the car. The driver was seriously 
injured but survived. Police see the incident as further evidence of the 
neighborhood's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are puzzled about what, if anything, can be done to stop the 
neighborhood's decline. 
</P>
<P>
While the task force was a successful operation, the unit was only a temporary 
solution to the neighborhood's problems, said Deputy Police Chief Ronald A. 
Frankle. Its members, who were borrowed from police divisions throughout the 
Valley, worked full time on Blythe for nine months and then split time between 
the neighborhood and other drug hot spots in the Valley for another year, he 
said. The unit was disbanded in April. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that another unit will be formed, Frankle said, since police 
administrators have decided that manpower cannot be spared. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said law enforcement is only part of a solution to Blythe Street's 
problems. Alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, poverty and crowded housing 
also must be addressed, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's office has scheduled a meeting of owners, managers, police and city 
officials Thursday to again discuss solutions to neighborhood woes. "I don't 
think there are any magic answers," Slater said. "But we have to get as many 
people involved as possible. It will take perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
Some on Blythe already have shown they can persevere. 
</P>
<P>
Combs, the apartment manager, said it has been an uphill battle in the past 
year to clean up the 40-unit complex he manages. He said he has evicted dozens 
of suspected gang members and drug dealers who were crowded into apartments in 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he said, syringes littered the building's stairwells and gang 
members hung around outside. Now the building is clean, and there is no 
loitering near the front gate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Combs' building, which he said was at the eye of the storm a year ago, is one 
of the few on the block without graffiti-covered exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Combs said, the windows of his apartment have been shot out 
or broken with rocks six times after threats by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is that I will outlast them," he said. "If somebody puts 
graffiti on my walls, I'll paint over it. We can do it over and over, but I 
won't stop. I won't let them get a foothold here. Because then this place would 
get like the rest of the street."

MIKE DOWNEY: CZECH THAT, MANDLIKOVA IS AN AUSSIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Mike Downey

<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to women's tennis, we think of Steffi Graf, the most dependable 
German machine since the Benz, or Chris Evert, who someday soon will step out 
of bounds never to step back, or Martina Navratilova, who can still teach the 
teen-agers a thing or two, or even, more recently, Tracy Austin, whose recent 
auto accident once again reminds us of how good she once was, and how much 
greater she might have become with a little better luck. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I gave Hana Mandlikova a second thought, though, was three years 
ago this summer, when we were both in Prague, Czechoslovakia, for the 
Federation Cup, the women's answer to Davis. It was her first visit to that 
country in several years, and my first time ever. The difference was, it was 
her homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, as usual -- no, more than ever -- was getting most of women's 
tennis' attention. Czechoslovakia was her home, too, but this was more than her 
welcome-home party. It was a drama. 
</P>
<P>
See, Mandlikova had merely gone away, stayed away, become a woman of the world. 
But Navratilova had formally defected, had become an American, had pledged 
allegiance to a different flag. 
</P>
<P>
Martina was not at all certain she would be welcomed back with open arms, even 
though she had turned into, without question, one of the greatest women 
athletes of all time. There was considerable concern about her return. Czech 
officials balked at first when asked if Navratilova could come. Then the 
Americans made an announcement that they were not coming without her. The 
Czechs relented. 
</P>
<P>
So, she went. And a welcoming committee met her at the airport. And she 
traveled into the Prague countryside to visit her old hometown. And she played 
before cheering crowds. And understandable tears were wept. 
</P>
<P>
And Hana Mandlikova? 
</P>
<P>
She just played tennis and kept her mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
Until one day, I remember somebody coming up to me and asking: "Hear about 
Hana?" 
</P>
<P>
"What about Hana?" 
</P>
<P>
"She put on a leather outfit and grabbed some guy and went over to City Hall 
and got married." 
</P>
<P>
"She did?" 
</P>
<P>
Turned out he was some Australian, somebody she had known for a while. Whether 
this was true love or a whim or a marriage of convenience, that was anybody's 
guess, but it was certainly Mandlikova's own private business -- except in 
Czechoslovakia, where she was not exactly your average private citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Six years earlier, as a teen-ager, she had won the Australian Open, been 
runner-up at the U.S. Open. A year later, she won the French, was second at 
Wimbledon. By 1985, she had led the Czechs to three straight Federation Cup 
championships, and had returned to her motherland to go after No. 4. She 
deserved a heroine's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Only she was sort of overlooked. Her wedding made more news than her 
continuously excellent tennis. Hana got applause. Martina got cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was much more an emotional time for Martina than for me. The only real 
emotional part for me was that I was getting married," said Mandlikova, who 
writes about that experience and many others in a new book, "Hana," not yet 
available in the States. 
</P>
<P>
Having missed much of the last half-year with a hamstring injury, Mandlikova 
put the time to good use, finishing her book. Now she's in Los Angeles -- the 
city of hamstring injuries -- to continue her comeback, playing in this week's 
Virginia Slims event at Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to see how it goes," she said. "With John McEnroe, it took him two 
years to get his game back. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to get your spirit back, your freshness, your 
eagerness. I'm prepared to lose a few matches as long as my heart is back in 
the game. If my heart is not involved, I can't play tennis, I can't make love, 
I can't laugh, I can't do anything. That's the way I am. I'm very emotional. If 
I don't have that, I'm half a person." 
</P>
<P>
She is divided in more ways than one. Mandlikova, too, changed her allegiance 
as well as her life. She not only married that Australian, you see. She became 
an Australian. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova, now 27, owns homes in Australia and Belgium. She has a 42-foot 
yacht in Australia that she moors in a place called Sanctuary Cove, and that is 
exactly what it provides her, a sanctuary, a place to get away from it all. A 
year ago January, she gained Australian citizenship. She wants to represent 
Australia in the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
So, why did she leave Czechoslovakia? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't 'leave' Czechoslovakia," she said. "I just knew I was never going to 
live there." 
</P>
<P>
It might confuse others, but it makes perfect sense to her. Czechoslovakia is 
home. There are so many governmental restraints, travel restrictions, income 
garnishes, etc., that establishing a residence elsewhere becomes, for some, the 
wise thing to do. You're a Czech, even if you are marching into a stadium with 
someone else's Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with all the changes for the better in Eastern bloc nations these 
days . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any changes," Mandlikova said. "Not in Czechoslovakia, anyway. The 
people in other countries, like Hungary, are much more open to glasnost and 
perestroika than Czechoslovakia has been. The people in Czechoslovkia still 
can't travel, and . . . oh, well. I really don't like to give my political 
opinions in public." 
</P>
<P>
Writing a book was hard in that sense. When Martina wrote one, she opened a 
vein and bled all over the pages. Told everything she knew, everything she 
felt. Hana wants to hold something back, but without being boring. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she wrote one, she joked: "Because I didn't have anything else to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
She kept a diary, though, during her playing days, and with its help described 
what life on the tour has been like. To some, Mandlikova's four Grand Slams 
make her one of history's best. To others, the depth of her talent has been 
diluted by her inconsistency, her unpredictability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the records speak for themselves," she said. "If people think I am 
inconsistent and unpredictable, fine. But besides Martina and Evert and Graf, 
during the last eight years I'm the only one who has been winning Grand Slams. 
So I think I have had a pretty successful career." 
</P>
<P>
For now, her book is on sale only in Australia, Europe and Canada, but with 
luck it will soon be available in America, and with more luck there will be 
other chapters to follow. When she dedicates the book to a friend, the 
inscription reads: "I hope there will be reason someday to write another one."

PURSLEY IS THRUST INTO ROLE OF OVERSEEING REVIVAL OF U.S. AQUATICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the bleakest night of an overall less-than-stellar Olympic swimming effort 
in Seoul last fall, Richard Quick, the U.S. coach at the time, sat at the side 
of the warm-up pool and enumerated, one more time for the record, what he 
thought was needed to get the United States back into a position of dominance 
in international waters. Among his suggestions was a recommendation for a 
full-time, long-term national coach. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Dennis Pursley became U.S. Swimming's national team director. 
</P>
<P>
He's not exactly a coach. That is, he doesn't stand on the deck with a 
stopwatch and he doesn't instruct any swimmer on how to swim. But he's not 
exactly a stick-to-the-office bureaucrat, either. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley comes from the coaching ranks and he believes that a big part of his 
job is to keep in constant contact with the coaches, to know what the needs 
are, and to help the coaches get the swimmers ready to win in the next Olympic 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, I see my job as doing everything I can to get the best team 
possible to Barcelona," Pursley said. "I'm looking at each meet, each event, as 
a step toward Barcelona." 
</P>
<P>
And having a national director means that there is an office in Colorado 
Springs that serves as a clearing house of information and ideas, that keeps 
all those steps in sync. "There is continuity, and a long-range view," Pursley 
said. "We don't have a new group coming in every year or every few years to 
re-invent the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
Of course there will still be a range of opinions. Not all of the coaches and 
swimmers and parents are going to agree on what steps are the best steps. For 
that matter, there were plenty of coaches who didn't think there was a need for 
a national director. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to success is the cooperation of the coaches," Pursley said. "I was 
very apprehensive about accepting the position because I wasn't sure what the 
level of cooperation would be. But in the first few months, I couldn't be more 
pleased. Even the coaches who are doubtful that this is the way we should go 
are being cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"That cooperative attitude is what is going to help U.S. Swimming regain the 
dominance we once enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
At the Olympic International Operations Committee meeting in April in Colorado 
Springs, Pursley was given approval for his first four-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of his objectives can be simply acted upon. Some are long-range goals. 
But at least there is a direction. 
</P>
<P>
Among Pursley's goals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Changing the scheduling of the Olympic trials. In 1992, the trials will be 
held a full five months before the Games, giving the swimmers time to recover 
from the very competitive qualifying meet and prepare for the Olympics as their 
individual coaches choose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Planning some training camps in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rethinking the national meet schedule to put the focus on what is best for 
the United States as a national team. A swimmer's competitions should build 
toward a best performance in international competition and Olympic competition. 
Meets should not divert attention and energies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establishing a system of rankings that would allow swimmers to make the 
national team and be automatically qualified for more than one international 
competition. That is, to eliminate the pressure on swimmers to peak for 
qualifying meets and give U.S. Swimming the opportunity to include in 
international competition swimmers who are likely to win medals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminating some of the scheduling conflicts between U.S. Swimming and the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Convincing the NCAA that a short-course program (yards) is at odds with the 
development of swimmers who must compete internationally long course (meters). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Developing better financial support for postgraduate swimmers in order to 
keep elite athletes swimming for the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promoting the concept of the U.S. team, not just in the few weeks around 
the international competitions, but at all times. 
</P>
<P>
No new notions at all. But until now, no one has been employed full time to 
bringing the coaches together to get these goals accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"My job has been likened to a general manager position," Pursley said. "I can 
free up the coaches to coach, unencumbered by administrative responsibilities. 
At the same time, I can bring some continuity to our teams. It's not an 
entirely new staff every few years." 
</P>
<P>
The national coaches now are elected to serve for about a year. Currently the 
U.S. team coaches are Don Gambril of the University of Alabama for the men and 
Dick Shoulberg of Team Foxcatcher for the women. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming has been evolving toward this arrangement for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Gambril was the first Olympic coach who was asked to serve a longer term, and 
he served as national coach in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1985, U.S. Swimming decided that a national head coach should serve 
four years, to develop the Olympic team. Quick was named to that position from 
1985 through the Olympics in the fall of 1989. But Quick, then the women's 
coach at the University of Texas, didn't have the position long before he was 
saying that the national coach should devote more time to the effort that 
anyone could devote while at the same time devoting full time to his own 
swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
The person in charge of directing the effort needed to have a background as a 
coach in order to understand the needs of the swimmers and the positions of the 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley has coached seven different teams, including the Lakeside (Ky.) Swim 
Club, the Cincinnati Pepsi Marlins, the Olympian Swim Club in Edmonton and the 
new Phoenician Swim team in Phoenix. Among the swimmers he has coached is Mary 
T. Meagher. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley also served as the national team director in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley makes it clear that among his first orders of business is figuring out 
just what his job is and what he can reasonably expect to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the time the position was created, all policy and structure was 
determined by a very large committee, 40 or 50 people on the Olympic 
International Operations Committee," Pursley said. "It was mostly prominent 
coaches and about 20% athletes. The committee met twice yearly for up to 15 
hours in a day. . . 
</P>
<P>
"There was a growing frustration because this committee wasn't able to 
accomplish what it wanted to accomplish. They felt we needed someone doing it 
day in and day out to establish continuity . . . That committee is still 
important. I am here to try to carry out the goals of the committee." 
</P>
<P>
And to serve as a liaison between the coaches and the committee. Which, 
basically, makes him a liaison between coaches and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that my responsibility is to work for the coaches and with the coaches, 
to keep my ear to the ground and determine, from the coaches' point of view, 
what needs to be done and what direction we want to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is a consensus of opinion, I will act to implement a program. When 
there is not a consensus of opinion, that's when we need a national director to 
make a decision. . . 
</P>
<P>
"But everything I do, I do with the input of the coaches. I've been pleased 
with the amount of input I've received, and I hope to get even more letters and 
phone calls. The phone lines are open."

IT IS ENOUGH TO GIVE WITT FITS; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER ACE STRUGGLES AGAIN AS BREWERS BEAT ANGELS, 5-2 
</P>

<P>
The Angels lead the American League in team earned-run average, despite the 
somewhat bloated 4.35 ERA put up by their one-time ace, Mike Witt, who has 
allowed fewer than six hits in just one outing this year and is yielding an 
average of eight hits a start. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Witt stepped up on the mound again, and again an Angel winning 
streak came to an end as the Brewers slapped him around for 10 hits en route to 
a 5-2 victory before a crowd of 42,324 at Milwaukee County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who had won their previous three, have now won 13 of their last 18 
games, and Witt has been the starting pitcher in three of the five losses. In 
fact, just about every time he gets a start these days, something bad happens . 
. . even when he pitches well. 
</P>
<P>
In his last start, the bullpen blew a 5-0 lead to Seattle. The time before 
that, Oakland won, 9-5, and cut the Angels' lead in the American League West to 
one game. 
</P>
<P>
Two starts before that, Baltimore beat the Angels, 3-2, in 11 innings. Saturday 
night, the Angels lost but managed to hang on to first place because the 
Seattle Mariners beat the Athletics, 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
"If you pitch well most of the time, you're going to win often," Witt said. "If 
you pitch well two out of five times, you're not going to win too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw decent tonight. I had good stuff. But getting out of tough situations 
is part of this game, and I had two tough situations and gave up two runs in 
each. So I don't think I pitched very well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Witt held the Brewers hitless in three of the six innings he pitched, but he 
gave up four hits and two runs in two others. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Rob Deer led off with a single, and one out later, Greg 
Brock doubled. Glenn Braggs and B.J. Surhoff followed with run-scoring singles, 
and the Brewers had a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Yount and Brock singled to lead off the sixth. Then, with one out, 
Surhoff laid down a bunt on a squeeze play, but Witt made an acrobatic, 
sprawling snatch-and-toss to get Yount at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being buoyed by a fine defensive effort, Witt promptly surrendered a 
run-scoring single to Meyer on the next pitch. Bill Spiers followed with an RBI 
double, and Milwaukee went ahead, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the ballgame right there," Witt said. "If I get (Meyer) out, it's a 
2-1 game and who knows what happens after that. I don't want to downplay his 
hit, but I didn't exactly make a great pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've given up a lot of runs with two outs this season." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels didn't provide Witt (7-9) with much offense, scoring only on solo 
homers by Lance Parrish and Wally Joyner. And they squandered some early 
chances against Ted Higuera (7-4), who pitched his first complete game of the 
year and improved his record since the All-Star break to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to get him early," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "We could've 
had four or five runs early, and that would have made a big difference. But we 
didn't do it, and (Higuera) pitched very well after that. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give Teddy credit. He threw the ball over the plate, and we made 
out. And when he started locating the ball, he got through some innings without 
making a lot of pitches, which allowed him to finish strong." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels left runners in scoring position with less than one out in the 
first, second and third innings. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White singled to center field and stole second base in the first, but 
Johnny Ray flied out, Chili Davis struck out and Joyner flied out to the wall 
in right. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington followed Parrish's second-inning homer with a double to 
right, but Dick Schofield flied to center, and Jack Howell lined out to right. 
</P>
<P>
And White walked, leading off the third, eventually stealing his way around to 
third, before Joyner flied deep to right to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Angels didn't capitalize on their chances, and the Brewers made the 
most of theirs. But the Angels haven't risen to the top of the standings on 
explosive offense alone. They have a league-leading 15 shutouts, and Witt has 
been involved in just one. But reliever Bob McClure got the victory that night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Mike made some tremendous pitches tonight," Rader said. "He had some 
really good innings. He makes a helluva play on the squeeze and then he makes 
that pitch to Meyer . . . you've got to make a quality pitch there." 
</P>
<P>
But Witt, the Angels' best-paid pitcher, just can't seem to make the right 
pitch at the right time these days. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish left Saturday night's game with bruises on his right knee 
and rib cage after a collision at home plate with Brewer left fielder Glenn 
Braggs. Milwaukee had runners on first and second with two out in the second 
inning when designated hitter Joey Meyer hit a ground ball into the hole at 
shortstop. Dick Schofield ranged onto the grass to backhand the ball, and 
Braggs apparently thought Schofield would attempt to get the slow-footed Meyer 
at first, so he continued around third and headed home. Schofield's throw to 
Parrish was there in plenty of time, and the surprised Braggs didn't slide or 
try to run over Parrish. Instead, he sort of stumbled and dived headlong into 
Parrish, who collapsed, but held onto the ball. "My knee's fine, but my side is 
a little stiff," Parrish said. "I knew once the throw was coming he was set on 
contact, so I just tried to hold onto the ball. If wasn't a cheap shot. It's 
just part of the game." Parrish was examined by Brewer team physician Dr. Paul 
Jacobs and will be available on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
The slumping Brian Downing got his third day off in four games, and Devon 
White, who was out Friday night with a throat and sinus infection, was back in 
the lineup and batting leadoff for the first time this season. "Brian 
volunteered to play yesterday because Devo was sick," Rader said, "but he has 
more trouble with left-handers than right-handers so it would have been a 
disservice to put him in there against (left-handed) Teddy Higuera. He just 
hasn't found stroke yet, and the best thing to do is get away from it. More 
often than not, these things are more emotional than physical." . . . Catcher 
Bill Schroeder's five-year-old daughter, Lindsey, who had been hospitalized 
with an ear infection, returned home Saturday, and Schroeder said he can 
finally get some sleep and enjoy baseball again. "She's much better now," he 
said. "It's a relief. Now, if I go 0 for 4, I'll give a (damn)." . . . A ball 
autographed by Jim Abbott went for $220 in a charity auction sponsored by the 
Brewer wives.

LANSFORD GETS ANOTHER LIFE FOR RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
HIS KICK IN OVERTIME BEATS 49ERS, 16-13, AFTER BLOCKED ATTEMPTS

<P>
As exhibitions go, Saturday night's American Bowl '89 at the Tokyo Dome wasn't 
worth the price of admission, but then, game programs were selling for more 
than $14. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't tell the players without a program, for 2,000 yen. Yet, a 
standing-room-only crowd of 43,896, some of whom paid $200 a seat for the 
privilege, seemed equally amused and impressed by the Rams' 16-13 overtime 
victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
On his fourth chance, kicker Mike Lansford kicked a 29-yard field game as time 
expired in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The fans here, who haven't seen a professional football game played on home 
soil in 13 years, reacted mightily to every moment and movement, from violent 
collisions on the field to the acrobatics of the Rams' baton twirler. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're a great crowd and were excited to see American football," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said. "As players, we were excited to get the chance to 
play in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
Too excited, as it turned out. The game actually spilled into extra minutes, 
the last thing either team wanted with Typhoon No. 13 sweeping toward Tokyo and 
chartered flights awaiting them at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford had a chance to win it for the Rams with 5:48 left in overtime, but 
his 27-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Wesley Walls. 
</P>
<P>
He had another shot with less than a minute remaining, but Walls again blocked 
his attempt, this one from 24 yards. However, Ram tackle Kevin Robbins was 
called for a false start before the block, and Lansford set up again from 29 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
A third attempt was also blocked, but both teams were called for false starts, 
and the down was replayed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Lansford connected and sent the Rams to the airport. But the Rams and 
49ers did their best to mess up complicated logistics that were months in the 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, with the 49ers on the Rams' goal line with a 13-6 
lead, rookie Frank Stams recovered a Terrence Flagler fumble at the seven and 
sent the momentum the other way. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove 93 yards from there and scored on Robert Delpino's one-yard run 
that tied the score with 8:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Starting quarterbacks Everett and Joe Montana were long gone by then, having 
finished up their tuneups in the second quarter. Both were sharper than might 
have been expected so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed eight of 13 passes for 81 yards, while Everett finished with 
five of nine for 69 yards and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start in the right direction," Everett said. "I didn't like the way my 
performance ended with a pass interception, but again, it's only our first 
preseason game." 
</P>
<P>
And a time to shake the rust from a few Rams. In fact, some would be 
hard-pressed to name the Rams' backup quarterback last year. 
</P>
<P>
He attempted only five passes all season, completing four for 38 yards. His 
name is Mark Herrmann, and he was impressive in his longest stint since joining 
the Rams as a free agent last summer. To give you a hint of how well Everett 
was going in 1988, Herrmann didn't appear in the team's last eight games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he stepped in and looked at home in the offense, exactly what 
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese had in mind when he suggested that the Rams 
rescue Herrmann from football's unemployment line. He had learned Zampese's 
complicated offense in San Diego, and the Rams' figured it was easier to bring 
in Herrmann than to break in a new quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann completed 16 of 29 passes for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The other star of the night was tailback Gaston Green, the team's first-round 
draft choice a year ago, who shook off some heavy cobwebs. He shared the 
tailback spot with Delpino and finished with 28 carries for 116 yards, nearly 
surpassing in one game his totals for the entire 1988 season, when Green 
carried 35 times for 117 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Montana and Everett exchanged enough fire to get their teams 
into kickingrange. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored on a 33-yard field goal by Mike Cofer with 6:03 left in the 
quarter, capping a nine-play, 41-yard drive. The Rams came back and tied the 
score during their next possession on a 32-yarder by Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
Montana then picked his way up the field, hitting Jerry Rice for 18 yards and 
John Taylor for 19 on successive completions. The 49ers stalled at the Ram 22, 
and Cofer's 39-yard field goal gave San Francisco a 6-3 lead with 11:15 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young replaced Montana on the 49ers' first possession of the second 
quarter. On first down from his own 36, Young took off on a 41-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
After escaping the rush, he cut his way through the middle before breaking down 
the right sideline. The biggest collision on the run was Young crashing into a 
Japanese photographer as he was forced out of bounds at the Ram 19. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored two plays after Young's run. Flagler broke left from the 15 
and had the ball stripped from his arms by safety James Washington at the 
three, the ball bounding toward the end zone. Ram cornerback Clifford Hicks had 
the ball in his hands before it squirted free and into the arms of receiver 
Terry Greer, who recovered in the end zone, giving the 49ers a 13-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann, who replaced Everett in the second quarter, then drove the Rams 68 
yards in eight plays into field-goal range. Lansford's 25-yarder with 2:11 left 
cut the deficit to seven before the half. On the drive, Herrmann completed 
three of four passes, including a 47-yard play to rookie Mike Williams, the 
team's 10th-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
The only other NFL game in Asia was in Tokyo in 1976, when St. Louis beat San 
Diego, 20-10.

WHITNEY HANDICAP AT SARATOGA; 
</P>
<P>
EASY GOER REPRISES FIRST CAREER VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
It sometimes is hard to find the winner's circle at Saratoga. In a concession 
to the track's 125-year-old tradition, the winner's circle is a mere ring of 
chalk in front of the stands. 
</P>
<P>
This is where Easy Goer ended up last summer after his first victory, in the 
second start of his career, and it's where he returned Saturday after winning 
the Whitney Handicap by 4 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two months after the 3-year-old colt won the Belmont, following 
second-place finishes behind Sunday Silence in the Kentucky Derby and the 
Preakness, trainer Shug McGaughey brought him back to the races against older 
horses and in humid, 95-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be a warmup for Easy Goer's next race, the $1-million Travers here 
in two weeks, but it proved to be much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
Turning for home, Pat Day had Easy Goer a close fourth in the six-horse field, 
surrounded by horses. The hole that opened was small, with Homebuilder on the 
outside and Lustra on the inside. Forever Silver, who had been running directly 
in front of Easy Goer, was tiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really worried," McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Pat sitting there, with a ton of horse under him and he wasn't way, way 
out of it. Horses usually have a way of fanning out at that point in the race." 
</P>
<P>
After he split horses at the three-sixteenths pole, Easy Goer ran the last 
eighth of a mile in a fast 11 2/5 seconds, finishing the 1 1/8 miles under 119 
pounds in 1:47 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
That time was two-fifths of a second slower than the stakes and track record 
set by Tri Jet, a 5-year-old carrying 123 pounds, in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Whitney to compare with Easy Goer's is when Alydar, Easy Goer's 
sire and then a 3-year-old, ran the same 1:47 2/5 under 123 pounds in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Forever Silver finished second Saturday, a half-length in front of 
Cryptoclearance, who carried high weight of 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The order of finish before 30,484 fans was Its Acedemic, Homebuilder and 
Lustra, who ran coupled with Cryptoclearance in the the betting. 
</P>
<P>
Winning for the ninth time in 13 starts, Easy Goer earned $172,500, pushing his 
earnings over the $2-million mark for owner-breeder Ogden Phipps. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer paid $2.60, $2.10 and $2.10, and the rest of the prices were all 
$2.10. The $2 exacta on Easy Goer and Forever Silver paid $5.20. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree and Triteamtri were scratched from the Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey entered Dancing Spree to run only if the track was off, but despite 
heavy rain Friday night, the racing strip was fast by mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Saratoga maintenance crew rolled the track Friday after the races and no 
horses were permitted to train on it Saturday morning, prompting speculation 
that Easy Goer might break the track record if the sun stayed out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"When the horsemen first heard about what was going on, they didn't like it, 
because they thought it was just being done for Phipps' horse," said P.G. 
Johnson, a trainer who didn't have a starter in the Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
"But when they found out that this is going to be the policy whenever it rains, 
then they didn't seem to mind." 
</P>
<P>
Phipps is a former chairman of the Saratoga board of trustees and his son is 
still a board member. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Miller, a veteran Saratoga trainer who won the Whitney with Java Gold in 
1987, said he had never seen the track this fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The track was fast," McGaughey said, "but when they run that slow of a pace at 
the start, you usually don't see horses run as fast as mine did at the end." 
</P>
<P>
With Lustra and Homebuilder up front, Forever Silver in third place and Easy 
Goer fourth, not far from the pace, the opening fractions were a slow :48 1/5 
for a half-mile, 1:12 for six furlongs and 1:36 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I hit him with the stick (in the stretch), it felt like he was 
going to come right through the bridle," said Day, who has won the Whitney 
three times in the last four years. He won with Lady's Secret and Java Gold in 
1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
"I was comfortable just following Forever Silver," Day said. "I knew that 
Jacinto (Vasquez) had some horse under him, and when Lustra gave it up, I eased 
on through. I felt like if I ever got some daylight, I'd be OK. I was never 
worried. In two jumps, he just exploded." 
</P>
<P>
Saratoga has a long history of major upsets, and Vasquez was a principal in one 
of the biggest shockers when he rode Onion to victory over Secretariat, the 
Triple Crown champion, in the 1973 Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer might not be a Secretariat yet, but Forever Silver, Vasquez's mount 
Saturday, was not going to be another Onion, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my eye on Easy Goer," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a question of whether he fired or didn't run his race. My horse is 
a good one, but the winner is just the best around." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is so good that the small list of trainers still considering the 
Travers got even smaller by Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shug McGaughey has won two consecutive Whitneys, having trained the filly 
Personal Ensign last year. . . . McGaughey had another 3-year-old colt win a 
stake Saturday, with Awe Inspiring taking the American Derby at Arlington Park. 
. . . McGaughey has another 3-year-old colt, Fast Play, who will run against 
Roi Danzig, Fire Maker and Is It True in today's $150,000 Jim Dandy at 
Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
In another stake at Saratoga on Saturday, Mr. Nickerson gave Jose Santos his 
fourth winner of the day with a 3 1/2-length victory over Quick Call in the 
$87,750 A Phenomenon. Houston, the morning-line favorite, was scratched from 
the six-furlong race. "The race didn't set up right, and it wasn't that 
important of a race, anyway," assistant trainer Jeff Lukas said. "We'll run him 
in the King's Bishop (at seven furlongs) on Travers day." In beating Quick 
Call, who had won six straight at Saratoga the last two years, Mr. Nickerson 
was timed in 1:08 4/5, missing the track record by four-fifths of a second.

NEWSWIRE: DORSETT, 35, MAY BE THROUGH AFTER HAVING MAJOR KNEE SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Dorsett of the Denver Broncos, the National Football League's No. 2 
all-time rusher, underwent major reconstructive knee surgery Saturday, leaving 
his football future in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett, 35, injured his left knee Thursday in a non-contact passing drill. He 
suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament, a torn lateral cartilage and a 
partial tear of the medial collateral ligament. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett, who spent 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before going to Denver 
last season, will miss the entire season -- which he said earlier would be his 
last. No announcement was made about his plans after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, the Pittsburgh Post-Dispatch reported that in an uncorrected 
proof of his autobiography, "Running Tough," Dorsett said he was represented by 
three agents while enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The report said "the events decribed would appear to violate NCAA rules dealing 
with extra benefits and agents, although the statute of limitations has 
expired."

Probe, winner of the first heat, and Park Avenue Joe, winner of the second, 
raced to the first dead heat in a Hambletonian race-off Saturday at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue Joe, however, was declared the winner because he finished second in 
the first heat. Probe broke stride and finished ninth in the second heat. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue Joe is trained by Chuck Sylvester, who also won the Hambletonian in 
1987 with Mack Lobell. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue Joe won $565,500 from a purse of $1,131,000. Probe won $282,750. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue Joe led throughout the race-off but, nearing the wire, Probe 
appeared to have a slight lead. Stewards called for two prints of the photo 
finish and deliberated for several minutes before declaring the race for 
3-year-old trotters a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
The time for the one-mile race-off was 2:00 2/5. The last quarter was trotted 
in a fast :26 3/5.

TENNIS / THOMAS BONK; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S GROUP SEEKS DIRECTOR, AND SUPPORT FROM TOP PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Bonk 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Diamond was the executive director of the women's pro tennis organization 
for 11 years, so he eventually learned to recognize when he was doing his job 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
"When the players were mad at me," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's where Merrett Stierheim, his successor, went wrong. Stierheim 
resigned his post with the Women's International Tennis Assn. last month after 
four years, which came as no surprise to Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"Merrett had the kid-glove approach to the players," Diamond said. "He didn't 
want anybody to hate him. But in that job, you've got to be disliked." 
</P>
<P>
Now, that job is open. Anybody want to be disliked? 
</P>
<P>
One who has been mentioned as a candidate is Ray Benton, a former president of 
ProServ who is now president of Travert, a bicycle-vacation tour company. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly have my plate full now," Benton said. "So I would say, no, I am 
not a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Merlo, vice president of marketing services for Philip Morris USA, also 
quickly removed her name from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not leaving any doors open," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, speculation continues to surround John Carroll, a business adviser to 
the WITA board of directors, and Sara Fornaciari, an agent at ProServ. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter who takes the leadership job of the women's tennis group, there 
are going to be problems waiting, Diamond said. Principal among them is the 
need to get the new generation of top players involved in decision making. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 players on the WITA board of directors only Martina Navratilova, 
Chris Evert and Pam Shriver are ranked in the top 10. The next-highest ranked 
player is Elise Burgin, No. 78. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be a major entity if the top players don't support your group," 
Diamond said. "The top players cannot sit on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a transition stage. Players like Chris and Martina and Pam are really 
dodgy about their future, although Martina is going to be a big, big factor for 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"But the future of women's tennis lies with Steffi Graf, Gabriela Sabatini, 
Monica Seles, Mary Joe Fernandez, Arantxa Sanchez (-Vicario), Zina Garrison. . 
. . And not one of those players is on the WITA board. 
</P>
<P>
"How the hell can you get anything done?" 
</P>
<P>
The WITA board is the most powerful force in the women's tennis organization 
and makes virtually all its money-making decisions. For instance, the board 
negotiates contracts with sponsors, determines prize money and regulates player 
commitments to the tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond believes that if the game's top players do not make the moves that 
affect them, then they may not pay any attention to the decisions and there 
will be chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"If players ranked 50, 60, 70 or 120 are making the decisions that affect No. 
1, 2 and 3 players, how do you think those top players will like it?" Diamond 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
A possible remedy would be a two-tiered WITA board proposed by Diamond. Top 20 
players would make all the decisions on running the circuit. The rest of the 
players would be in another group responsible for making the circuit's rules. 
</P>
<P>
Benton suggested a similar two-board setup, but said that the second group 
needs to be composed entirely of business and marketing experts. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, who says he has no interest in his old job, has been the promoter of 
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles tournament and its predecessors under other 
names since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
But if he were giving advice to the new WITA executive director, Diamond said 
it would be to be tough and enforce the same rules for all. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to make your decisions and stay with them," he said. "Things are 
really fragmented now. So you make your decisions and then work with the group 
you're offending and explain why you're offending them. 
</P>
<P>
"All that you are really going to do is lessen the anger a little bit. But at 
least you make them understand why you're so offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Evert forever? Diamond is convinced that Chris Evert's career won't last into 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bet that this is her last year," he said. "In fact, I'd be amazed if 
she played another tournament. I think she's had it." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it is beginning to appear that Evert has played her last tournament. 
</P>
<P>
She withdrew from this week's Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, which was supposed 
to be her hard-court warmup tournament for the U.S. Open, and will probably 
have to play an event in Toronto as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would be surprised if she does," Martina Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she's even made up her mind whether she will play the Open or 
not. If she is going to play it, it's because she thinks she should, not 
because she wants to. I think that's where she wants to finish the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't really need to play it," Navratilova said. "I think she's really 
happy (living) in Aspen. I think she'd be better off not playing. I mean, I 
guess if she got to the semis, it would be all right, but who needs it? She 
could go out on Court 3 or something. The atmosphere there just does not lend 
itself to nostalgia." 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps the way to go out is on Centre Court at Wimbledon, as Evert did, 
losing to the eventual champion, the No. 1 player in the world, Steffi Graf.

Joe Gibbs took attendance, then gave his team a passing grade. 
</P>
<P>
"The high point was that everyone played and we still won," Gibbs said Saturday 
after his Washington Redskins beat the Buffalo Bills, 31-6, in the Hall of Fame 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
Three quarterbacks and eight running backs got a chance to show Gibbs what they 
could do as the Redskins opened the National Football League exhibition season 
by outgaining the Bills, 404 yards to 170. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no serious injuries and both teams looked sharp," Gibbs added. 
</P>
<P>
Said Buffalo Coach Marv Levy: "Our goal was to play everyone and get a good 
look at a a lot of people. We did that. 
</P>
<P>
"What was disappointing was that no one stood out. That the game was on 
national television didn't bother me. That the score was a considerable margin 
did bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Willard Reaves scored on a pair of short runs and Mark Rypien completed 10 of 
12 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown to lead the Washington offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our quarterbacks played cautious," Gibbs said. "We ran a lot of out patterns, 
a lot of safe patterns. But I thought the quarterbacks got off to a good 
start." 
</P>
<P>
Rypien, a fourth-year pro and the starter while Doug Williams recovers from 
back problems, said he's not worried about losing the No. 1 job when Williams 
gets healthy. Williams was released from the hospital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always a possibility," Rypien said. "I can't worry about it. I just go 
out and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's starting quarterback, Jim Kelly, played only one series and connected 
on two of five passes for 32 yards.

Terry Bradshaw, never one to avoid controversy, jumped right into one at his 
induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The former Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback was criticized for choosing his CBS 
Sports television partner, Verne Lundquist, to be his presenter, rather than a 
former coach or teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the greatest day of my life and I get nailed down here," Bradshaw said at 
a news conference before the induction ceremonies. "What's with you people? My 
choice is very simple. For all you Pittsburghers, listen one more time and see 
if you all can't get this through your head. 
</P>
<P>
"(Former Steeler owner) Art Rooney is gone. He was my presenter, but he's dead, 
people. That's the only person that would have represented me. The reason is, 
he and I were close. And I'm the type of person, in an event like this, that 
I'm not going to have some athlete or coach present me who I'm not going to see 
ever again." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw said he selected Lundquist because "I want someone I was close to." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, Mel Blount, Art Shell and Willie Wood knew the joy of winning when 
they starred in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
They shared that feeling again at the induction. "I loved winning. I didn't 
care. I just wanted to win," Bradshaw said when asked how he wanted to be 
remembered. "I'd like people to say nothing else but, 'That sucker just loved 
to win.' That would cover it pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said for the other three inductees. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw was the quarterback and Blount a cornerback as Pittsburgh won four 
Super Bowl championships. Willie Wood was at safety as Green Bay won two Super 
Bowls. Shell played tackle as the Raiders won two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers dominated the 1960s. The Steelers won their four Super Bowls in the 
1970s and 1980s. And the Raiders had a higher winning percentage than any pro 
sports franchise over those years. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great things about the Steelers is that we drew strength from one 
another," Bradshaw said. "It wasn't a black guy you drew it from. It was a 
group of men who had a lot of respect for one another, who had a lot of talent 
and who had a lot of love of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Blount intercepted 57 passes and recovered 13 opposing fumbles during his 
14-year career. He is currently director of player relations in the NFL office. 
</P>
<P>
Blount was presented by Dan Rooney, president of the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go to a lousy team to establish an identity," Bradshaw said. "I 
didn't know anything about the Steelers, I'd never seen them play. They were 
losers. That was good. I said, 'Hey, I like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, a 6-foot-3, 210-pounder out of Louisiana Tech, completed 2,025 of his 
3,901 career passes for almost 16 miles in yardage. He threw for 212 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He was most valuable player in the 1979 and 1980 Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Shell was a pillar for 15 years for the Raiders. A third-round draft pick out 
of Maryland Eastern Shore in 1968, the 6-5, 285-pounder played in eight Pro 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he appreciated the "Raider way" because diverse personalities could 
still come together for a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
"You could be a renegade or a nice guy. They didn't try to program us. Be 
yourself, be a man," Shell said. "They would allow you to be yourself. We had 
(Ted) Hendricks and (John) Matuszak. They'd do wild things. But on Sunday, we 
came to play. We came to play as one. We were a team." 
</P>
<P>
Shell pointed to Raider owner Al Davis, who presented him at the induction 
ceremonies, and said, "He's the reason I'm here. He took a chance on a small 
kid -- I mean a kid from a small college -- and showed me a lot of patience. I 
had a lot to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wood: "I was just satisfied to be a Green Bay Packer and having all the 
success we had as Packers. Being in the Hall of Fame, that was something that 
was beyond my wildest dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Wood came out of USC as an unheralded backup quarterback and defensive back. 
Undrafted, he signed as a free agent with the Packers after a friend's 
letter-writing campaign on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who intercepted 48 passes between 1960 and 1971, said he only wished that 
his late coach, Vince Lombardi, were present for his induction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked into the Packer camp, there was no doubt who was in 
charge," Wood said. "The first time I met Vince Lombardi, he scared the hell 
out of me. And I've been shaking ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Wood played 12 seasons, including Super Bowl champion clubs in 1967 and 1968. 
Wood was presented by his second head coach with the Packers, Phil Bengtson.

NEW HALL OF FAMER WOOD WAS GREEN BAY'S LOMBARDI ON THE FIELD

<P>
Green Bay was something. It was far and small and cold. Sometimes you went up 
from Chicago or Milwaukee in a DC-3. Sometimes you stopped in Oshkosh. On a 
Saturday night in Green Bay the streets were empty -- if you walked a block the 
wind would tell you why. The bars would be full. Everybody would be talking 
about the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
The Pack. 
</P>
<P>
All those guys in this one little town, kind of giants of the Northland: 
Hornung and Taylor and Starr and Nitschke and Willie Davis and Herb Adderley 
and Forrest Gregg. They're all in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. And Saturday 
-- at last -- they were joined by their free safety, Willie Wood. Willie Wood 
-- alone -- could bring down Jim Brown in the open field. 
</P>
<P>
Wood came from the District of Columbia, a free agent out of USC with a dream 
of playing pro football. In 1960 he landed at this outpost that Vince Lombardi 
ruled like a foreign legion. No rookie had time to reflect on where he was: 
Depending on the viewpoint, the quaintest football town in America, or surely 
the end of the earth. Lombardi all but squeezed the life out of each player 
with mental pressure and physical torment -- and who around there was going to 
tell Lombardi (with his gap-toothed maniacal grin) to chill out? 
</P>
<P>
(A Packer, sitting in his motel room on the eve of a game, looked out his 
window and saw Lombardi, walking patrol. "There's a man," he said with 
contempt, "who doesn't have a friend in the world." That's what many Packers 
thought of Lombardi then, but not what they thought of him when they won all 
the big games, and not what they thought of him when he left Green Bay, and 
when he died, and certainly not now when they think of him.) 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm here," said Wood, and indeed Saturday he was in Canton, Ohio, to be 
enshrined, "Vince had to be the one who got me here." 
</P>
<P>
A player who had been of no concern to so many pro scouts, general managers and 
coaches, Wood was as obvious as a snowstorm to Lombardi. He was fast and a sure 
tackler; he could hit a runner at the ankles and put him on his head. He could 
steal a pass, return a punt, block a kick and pick up other defenders' slack. 
He never missed a game. 
</P>
<P>
As the free safety, he was as free as any player ever was in the Lombardi 
scheme of football. He was the one player Lombardi expected a surprise from, 
and usually got. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi didn't give leeway. When Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston pulled out 
from their guard positions for a Hornung sweep, they followed a road map. When 
Starr threw deep to Dowler or McGee, it was to the spot that Lombardi had 
pinpointed during the week. When Willie Davis rolled over an offensive tackle 
and wrapped up a quarterback, it was on Lombardi's command. 
</P>
<P>
What Wood could do and Lombardi loved to see was the flow of play reversed, 
suddenly going the Packers' way with Wood running back an intercepted pass. 
Tucking the ball under his arm, he put away the first Super Bowl with an 
interception and 50-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
But what Lombardi liked most about Wood was his leadership. In the still 
stellar "Instant Replay: The Green Bay Diary of Jerry Kramer," Kramer wrote: 
"Next to Lombardi, Wood scares his own teammates more than anybody else does. 
Wood even scares Ray Nitschke. 'I hate to miss a tackle,' Ray says, ' 'cause if 
I do, I know I'm gonna get a dirty look from Willie. He'll kill you with that 
look.' " 
</P>
<P>
To understand how tough Nitschke was, reserve Steve Wright helped put it in 
perspective. Before Wright took an off-season job with the Everseal Industrial 
Glue Co., which needed a salesman up in the Wisconsin area, the job was offered 
to Nitschke, who didn't want it. Wright used to fantasize about Nitschke as a 
glue salesman: "He'd throw down a hunk of glue in front of you and say, 'You 
want some glue? Here. Buy it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The late Henry Jordan was tough too. Wright never has gotten over the tackle 
from Virginia, his life or his death. "He had back trouble and he used to get 
all doubled up with cramps on hot days. They used to straighten him out by 
hanging him up on a door. I can still remember ol' Henry just hanging up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
If Wood was that tough and that good (eight Pro Bowls in 12 seasons, between 
1960 and 1971), why did it take 13 times before he got enough writers' votes to 
make it into the Hall? It's been a hard wait. "People would ask me, 'Willie 
Wood, why aren't you in the Hall of Fame?' I never had any comment on that. My 
wife was the spokesperson on that question. She wanted it for me." She died, 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Wood died a year and a half ago. "It was heart failure," Wood said. "It 
was unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
Bad enough that Wood, a Washington businessman, has yet to be named to any 
coaching job or meaningful management position in the National Football League. 
But that didn't stop him from becoming pro football's first black head coach -- 
in the World Football League and later in the Canadian Football League. Now 
he's been out of the game since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He waited, Sheila waited. 
</P>
<P>
Their three children were there for Saturday's induction ceremony. So was his 
mother. "And half of D.C.," he said. And Fuzzy and the gang: Thurston, Max 
McGee, Davis, Dave Robinson, Ron Kostelnik, Kramer, Paul Hornung, Adderley. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers always moved together. On Saturday mornings under Lombardi they'd 
take a train down from Green Bay to play "home" games in Milwaukee. Like an 
army slowly closing on the front, they rolled silently through the dairy land. 
</P>
<P>
Before the war, however, was the fun. (They had it backward, but not by choice; 
it was off to Green Bay right after the game.) 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I was out with the veterans," Wright recalled, "was in 
Milwaukee. I thought I was really big time. I went downtown and bought a 
Stetson hat and that night I found a girl in town, picked her up and went over 
to a place. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a back room, and all the Packers were there: Hornung, Jerry Kramer, Jim 
Taylor, Ron Kramer, Dan Curry, Max McGee, Fuzzy Thurston, the whole crowd. I 
walked back there with my date, and that was the last time I saw either the hat 
or her." 
</P>
<P>
Here they were again, all coming to Canton, to celebrate once more. For Willie 
Wood. 
</P>
<P>
"Canton," Wood said, "will never be the same." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of it now is just talk. 
</P>
<P>
Of Vince. 
</P>
<P>
Of the coldest day, of the deepest mud, of the heaviest rains, of the driving 
snows and of the clearings after the storms, the sunshine of their youth.

PRO SURFING AT HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS HOPING TO RIDE TITLE WAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Thomas continued to glide over the Huntington Beach surf as well as the 
top-seeded competitors Saturday in the Op Pro Surfing Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who is seeded 12th, pulled his second upset in a row with a 69 to 68.5 
quarterfinal victory over fourth-seeded Martin Potter of England, the current 
world-tour points leader. Thomas upset fifth-seeded Tom Carroll of Australia in 
Friday's third round. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas will meet defending Op Pro champion Tom Curren in the semifinals today 
at 8 a.m. The finals are scheduled for 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Curren, who is from Santa Barbara but has lived in France the last five months, 
advanced with a win over Mike Parsons of Laguna Beach, 81.0 to 72.5. Richie 
Collins of Newport Beach and Sunny Garcia of Waianae, Hawaii, will meet in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The semifinal matchup with Curren, a two-time world champion aiming for his 
fourth Op Pro title, has Thomas looking for revenge. Curren won their only 
other matchup a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to surf really well," said Thomas, who is from Sunset Beach, 
Hawaii. "He's the best surfer in the world in my opinion. I really have nothing 
to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a dream come true to take down Tom Curren at the Op Pro." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas held off Potter in the closing seconds to earn one of the closest 
victories so far at the championships. He led by only three-tenths of a point 
when Potter caught a wave with 15 seconds left in the 30-minute heat. 
</P>
<P>
Judges add up the scores of the top four waves to determine a surfer's overall 
total. 
</P>
<P>
Potter scored 13.8 out of a possible 30 points, but it wasn't enough to improve 
his overall score. Meanwhile, Thomas picked up a wave just before the final 
horn sounded, scoring a 10.5 and erasing an earlier score of 10.3 to increase 
his lead by two-tenths. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about holding him off the (first) wave because I had priority," 
Thomas said. "It was a tough move. If I would have taken the first wave and 
slipped up, then he could have had the second one. Fortunately, we both caught 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he had to keep his composure in the final minute. He knew the 
competition was close because he listened to the scores over the public-address 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I get that kind of composure from golf," said Thomas, who has an 18 handicap. 
"If I fluff one shot, I can always make the next one. Surfing is all about 
holding your composure. That was a strong force in my success last year on the 
tour." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 21, jumped from 44th on the tour in 1987 to 12th last year. A four-year 
pro, he hopes he can get his first win on the tour at the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fifth at the Op last year," he said. "I've always done well at events in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
So has Garcia, who beat Rob Bain of Australia, 85.1-82.6, in the quarterfinals. 
Bain's elimination marked only the fourth time an Australian hasn't reached the 
semifinal of an Assn. of Surfing Professionals event. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have lost, everyone would have remembered me as the guy who was 
bumped out by the Australian," Garcia said. "It was a make-or-break heat." 
</P>
<P>
Collins defeated Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach, 90.5 to 65, to make his first 
semifinal appearance in the Op Pro. Collins said he has used the Op Pro to 
experiment with new maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing all different kinds," he said. "I started copying Potter 
because he's been winning. I've changed my style a lot in the last eight weeks. 
I'm getting more comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he and Collins have similar styles, which should make the semifinal 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Frieda Zamba, a four-time world champion, defeated Michelle Donoghoe of 
Australia, 57.5-37, in the women's semifinals. Zamba, of Flagler Beach, Fla., 
will meet Kim Mearig of Carpinteria in the finals today at 9 a.m. Mearig 
defeated Pam Burridge of Australia, 42.5-34.3, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for me was to get a wave where I could do more than 
one maneuver," said Zamba, the 1986 Op Pro winner. "The waves had no form when 
they did come in."

EVALUATING GTE MINORITY CONTRACTOR MENTORSHIPS;

<P>
It was the summer of 1987, and the executives of Butler Service Group, one of 
the country's biggest suppliers of temporary technical help, faced a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
A big customer, GTE California, announced that it would shift a substantial 
share of its business to firms run by minorities as a result of pressure from 
the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, operated by white men and owned by a company traded in the 
over-the-counter stock market, had a choice. 
</P>
<P>
It could forfeit what had been a $12-million-a-year relationship with GTE. Or, 
somehow, Butler could forge an alliance that would let it hang onto as much of 
the business as possible within the constraints of GTE's affirmative action 
dictates. 
</P>
<P>
Butler took the latter course. 
</P>
<P>
It handed over to an employee its Southern California operations, including an 
office in San Dimas and a work force of dozens of engineers. It stocked the 
board of directors of the new firm, Telco Services Inc., with Butler executives 
and signed a contract to handle most of the administration and management of 
the company for a fee. In exchange, Butler kept 49% of Telco's stock, leaving 
Telco's Latino chief executive with just enough of a stake to satisfy the 
California Public Utilities Commission's criterion for minority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
In Butler's strategy, along with the similar paths charted by other GTE labor 
contractors, lies a parable about the limits on government's ability to alter, 
by fiat, the habits and ties that for decades have blocked minorities' access 
to the billions spent by California's biggest utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than create opportunities for existing minority firms or for new 
companies independent of what civil rights groups decry as an "old boy" network 
of contractors, GTE has given more than $9 million yearly in contract labor 
work to three firms partly owned by and closely tied to longtime, non-minority, 
GTE contractors -- a fact the vendors and GTE acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $3 million has gone to a Los Angeles firm -- run by a white male 
employed for years by one of the non-minority contractors -- whose minority 
status has been called into doubt. GTE auditors contend that the white male, 
rather than the Native Americans who own two-thirds of Main Communications, 
actually runs the company. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, minority business people have, indeed, gotten a toehold in a 
segment of the telecommunications business that previously was closed to them. 
One minority firm late last month bought back the 49% of its stock held by its 
non-minority "mentor," securing its independence just short of two years after 
its founding. 
</P>
<P>
But the entree has been costly. Those firms with ties to a non-minority company 
have paid out half their profits -- and sometimes a significant portion of 
their revenues, as well -- to white-owned companies that had been doing 
business with GTE all along. 
</P>
<P>
GTE insists that its reliance on minority firms with ties to familiar, 
reliable, white-owned vendors has aided the phone company and minorities alike. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the thinking for having mentorships is to get minority companies up 
and running so they get some . . . work, they develop a capital base and they 
learn the business, bearing in mind it's to their advantage to become 
independent, because they don't have to split the money for certain contracts," 
said Larry Cox, a spokesman for Thousand Oaks-based GTE California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really unfair," he said, "for anyone to expect minority 
companies, brand new to the industry, to be able to go in and compete at the 
same level as a company that's been there 10 or 15 years with millions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), author of the legislation that 
persuaded California's biggest utilities to promise 20% of their business to 
women and minorities by 1993, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
65% Are 'Fronts' 
</P>
<P>
"What you're describing," Moore said, "are people who refuse to change and 
refuse to do business in the manner we proposed." 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties faced by the state's utilities in finding capable minority 
companies -- and, perhaps, the utilities' hesitancy to do business with them -- 
are reflected in experts' estimates that as many as 65% of the contractors 
counted by the utilities as minority- or woman-owned in fact are "fronts" 
controlled by white males. 
</P>
<P>
Of California's seven largest utilities, GTE has claimed the biggest progress 
in meeting the 20% minority contracting goal. But civil rights groups have 
informed the PUC that they are dubious about the $83.2 million in minority 
contracts that the company claimed for 1988, and GTE has agreed to a complete, 
independent audit of its minority procurement program. 
</P>
<P>
For years, GTE contracted with an established group of national companies to 
supply the technical personnel -- engineers, cable splicers, linemen and others 
-- needed to extend telephone service to growing communities. Butler, Burnup 
&amp; Sims, Volt Information Sciences and a few others acted as temporary 
services, recruiting the workers, serving as their employer and sending them 
where they were needed by GTE. Only one of the vendors, Carrier Communications, 
had non-traditional ownership; the Nevada firm is headed by a white woman. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legislature in 1986 ordered public utilities to create or expand 
minority procurement programs, GTE quickly recognized contract labor as a 
service that could fairly readily be obtained from minority vendors. "Job 
shops," as the temp services are called, require little more than an office and 
a telephone to start. And GTE was willing to give the new companies time to get 
established before insisting that they, like their non-minority predecessors, 
assume the riskier task of bidding on the construction work involved in 
stringing phone service to fringe developments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift to Minorities 
</P>
<P>
"This was an area where we could break in quickly," said Steven J. Carr, a GTE 
purchasing agent who, at the time, was responsible for recruiting labor 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1987, GTE let its existing vendors know that it would be shifting its 
contract work to minority companies. Within weeks, according to state 
corporation records and interviews with the principals of the companies, their 
minority replacements were in place. 
</P>
<P>
Butler helped form Telco in August. Hood Corp., a Whittier firm that long had 
done underground construction work for GTE, helped establish Atramentech Inc. 
Hood purchased a 49% share of the Upland firm (its name is from the Latin word 
for "black") and assigned a top executive to help Atramentech's black 
president, former college professor Elizabeth Johnson, learn the job shop 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joe C. Baker, who had run Volt's West Coast job shop operations, 
took the upheaval at GTE as his cue to quit the big temporary service and 
devote full time to Main Communications, a firm he had started in 1983 with his 
wife Jeanine and her father, Arthur F. Main, both of whom are registered 
members of the Potawatomi Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, GTE began to take job slots away from its longtime vendors, 
reassigning them to the new firms. Technical workers for the first time were 
encouraged to jump between companies, if it meant joining a minority 
contractor. Butler simply transferred most of its work force to Telco. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Volt, with an investment of about $10,000, took a 49% share in the 
last of the new minority companies, KV Telecommunications. KV's chief 
executive, E. Keith McKeague, an ethnic Hawaiian, said he proposed the 
association to Volt Executive Vice President Jerome Shaw, with whom he had been 
friends for years. McKeague owns 41% of the firm. Its other minority owner, 
Vice President John L. Bettis, is a black man who quit a job at Volt to join 
KV. Bettis owns 10% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confused and Outraged 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1988, the switch-over to the minority firms was complete. At 
Thanksgiving time, GTE supervisors had informed the last 50 or so Burnup &amp; 
Sims employees -- a group that numbered 300 less than two years earlier -- that 
if they wished to continue working at GTE, they would have to go to work for 
one of the minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
Though telephone contract workers by nature are itinerants, crisscrossing the 
country to extend phone service to newly developing communities, many were 
confused, even outraged, by the turmoil unleashed at GTE. Especially angry were 
those who left Burnup &amp; Sims: Not only did they give up one of the best 
benefits packages in the industry, they said, but they also lost service 
credits toward vacations, sick leave and retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many simply did not like being told, in effect, for whom they were 
going to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't ever work for anyone in a forced situation," said one engineer who 
refused a job offer when Carrier called to say it had taken over his slot from 
Burnup &amp; Sims. "This is a free country," he said, "and I'll work for 
whomever I want to work for." The engineer, who was afraid that he would be 
unable to work again for GTE if he were identified, left Southern California 
rather than continue doing his old job for a new company. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the deals cut to create the new firms? 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three companies with ties to a majority contractor contends that it 
satisfies the state's criteria for being a minority vendor -- 51% minority 
ownership and genuine day-to-day control in the hands of a minority group 
member. Each has been examined and approved by auditors hired by GTE. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was a Crock' 
</P>
<P>
Yet the mentorships have drawn much suspicion. Assemblywoman Moore first 
questioned GTE about the status of Telco and Atramentech -- and about Main, as 
well -- in October, 1987, shortly after they began doing business with the 
phone company. Competitors in the tight-knit world of contract labor cast 
aspersions on each others' credibility. The contract workers themselves heard 
the rumors and wrote off the contracting program as a bureaucratic boondoggle. 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling I got from everybody out in the field was that it was a 
crock," said Doug Parrish, whom Butler assigned to direct Telco's recruiting 
efforts and who now is a recruiter for Volt in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
GTE officials concede that it was in the interest of the longtime contractors 
to lose as little as possible in the transition to minority procurement. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys had been in business with us for quite a while," said Carr. "It was 
big business for them -- a very lucrative business. To just bail out because 
somebody changed their mind about what the rules were didn't make much sense." 
</P>
<P>
The new companies have varying degrees of independence from their mentor firms. 
</P>
<P>
Take Telco. Carr, the GTE purchasing agent, says Butler "brought forth" Telco. 
Adds Parrish: "It would be hard for me to say in no uncertain terms that 
(Telco) ran itself." According to Cox, GTE decided last week to conduct a new 
audit of the firm's minority status. 
</P>
<P>
Telco's first 51% owner, Ebert J. Vallejos, who now works for a Butler 
subsidiary in Sacramento, referred calls about the two firms' relationship to 
Butler. So did its new majority owner, Kathryn Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Minorities Benefit 
</P>
<P>
Marc D. Freedman, Butler's general counsel, insists that Telco -- whose 
executive office is at the same New Jersey address as Butler's -- is an 
independent firm. But he is not shy in explaining Butler's rationale for 
helping create Telco. "Would you rather make 100% of a requisition, none of it 
or some of it?" Freedman asked. "If part of your market is taken away, you as a 
businessman look for a way to retain as much of it as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the protection of Butler's interests, he added, at least two minorities 
have benefited from the founding of Telco -- Vallejos, a Latino, and Ellis, a 
white woman. "Their lots in life have improved in terms of experience, 
compensation and things like that," Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
Atramentech, by contrast, severed its formal ties with Hood nine days ago when 
its president, Elizabeth Johnson, bought out Hood's 49% stake -- in part to put 
an end to questions about her company's minority status. Until then, she 
acknowledged, the doubts, if misplaced, were understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"I've read all the federal legislation," Johnson said before the repurchase, 
"and we're organized right out on the ledge." 
</P>
<P>
Legislators may have intended that contracting programs allow minority firms to 
stand on their own, Johnson said. But she is convinced that without alliances, 
minorities will fail. 
</P>
<P>
"From a competitive, capitalistic perspective," Johnson said, "I don't think 
the small company will survive doing it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Main's founders know how hard it is to get started without backing. They pooled 
all their resources -- including mortgaging their homes -- to raise the 
$175,000 with which they opened the firm's doors, according to Joe Baker, the 
company's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Status 
</P>
<P>
But a GTE audit concluded that Main is not a minority company. The auditor said 
Baker runs the business, and both competitors and engineers employed by Main 
say they share that impression. While it conducts a new audit of Main's status, 
GTE is not counting $2.9 million in business with Main toward its minority 
contracting goals. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker -- outraged that the first auditor based his finding on paper work, 
never visiting the company's Westchester office -- is insistent that the firm's 
three owners share in all major decisions. And he notes that more than half of 
Main's 87 employees are minority group members. 
</P>
<P>
Carr says he carefully weighed the new companies' minority status before 
inviting them into GTE's circle of vendors. When non-minority firms proposed 
blatant "fronts," he rejected them. 
</P>
<P>
One underground construction firm, Carr recalled, "brought in a black fellow 
and said, 'Here's our boy, we're going to make him the president and owner of a 
new company. Don't worry about the quality of the work; we'll be taking care of 
that for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Carr, in picking contractors with ties to GTE's traditional vendors, also 
passed over at least 20 small firms unallied with non-minority companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a responsibility to GTE of California to find good people, and in an 
effort to do that, I had to utilize those companies that could recruit talent 
we had experience with and understood our system," he explained. Some of the 
firms that came forward seemed to have been thrown together over a few beers, 
Carr added. "I was most comfortable with the companies we went with." 
</P>
<P>
GTE got more than comfort out of the arrangements, though, according to 
Johnson, who while benefiting from Carr's decisions detected some cynicism in 
the phone company's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes GTE's life easier if a minority company stays with a majority 
company," she observed, "because the old grandfather way of doing business is 
going to continue, and obviously the majority company is going to keep the 
minority company in line." 
</P>
<P>
GTE has placed the new contractors on notice that they must "have the resources 
and ability to stand alone" by November, according to Carr. GTE officials, 
however, say that standard has not been defined; Carr suspects that it would 
allow Telco's relationship with Butler, for one, to continue. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some of GTE's new contractors shake their heads in wonder at 
the forces let loose when the phone company set out to dramatically boost its 
dealings with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until a couple of years ago, nobody wanted an association with minorities 
whatsoever," said Bettis of KV. "Now that there's money to be made in it, 
everybody's jumping on the minority bandwagon."

THOSE PESKY PC SOFTWARE BUGS ABOUND

<P>
There are probably many ways to insult a computer programmer -- just try 
calling one a "propeller head" -- but none is more sure to do the job than 
describing his work as "spaghetti code." 
</P>
<P>
"Never, never say that," warns Susan Morgan, president of Softview Inc., a 
Camarillo publisher of top-selling income tax programs for personal computers. 
"That's saying he's an amateur who doesn't know what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
But as software programs, particularly those for the personal computer, become 
ever more complex, the chances increase dramatically that the thousands of 
strings of code making up a program will end up becoming the electronic 
equivalent of a heap of knotted pasta. The result: software that can prompt 
anything from an occasional computer malfunction or benign on-screen gibberish 
to system crashes and devastating data destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Or, in a word, "bugs." 
</P>
<P>
And much to the consternation of Wall Street investors and high-tech 
executives, buggy programs are becoming an increasingly vexing problem for some 
of the biggest software firms. Bugs, it seems, are creeping in everywhere -- 
and not just in sloppy, poorly designed, so-called spaghetti-code programs. 
Just late last month, for instance, Torrance-based Ashton-Tate reported a 
$19.8-million quarterly loss attributed largely to bugs in its most recent 
database software, dBase IV. 
</P>
<P>
"For the big programs, like dBase IV, total debugging is almost impossible," 
says Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, a Cambridge, Mass., software 
newsletter. "The possibilities of what can go wrong literally approach 
infinity." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Mosley, a software analyst at the San Jose high-tech market research 
firm Dataquest, adds: "It's not like 1982 anymore when you can have a program 
that does one simple thing. Now if you have a word-processing or spreadsheet 
program, it has to have graphics. And a database program has to be able to work 
with lots of other programs. When you have all these tied together with 
networks, you can bet that Murphy's Law applies exponentially." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, finding and correcting these glitches -- a process called 
debugging -- is becoming an ever more important task for software publishers. 
But this time-consuming and unpredictable work is barely able to keep pace with 
the problems that are emerging. 
</P>
<P>
Software bugs come in a variety of forms. They can be simple errors committed 
at the time that a program is written, the equivalent of failing to cross a "t" 
or dot an "i." Or they can be the result of more complicated interactions 
between two or more parts of the program that don't quite mesh. (Although 
software "viruses" typically have the same effect as bugs, they are not the 
same. Viruses are intentionally caused; bugs are mistakes.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Kiss of Death 
</P>
<P>
Bugs can also be basic flaws in the initial design of the program. Perhaps a 
program just doesn't do the job that it was intended to perform, or an entire 
batch of internal instructions are omitted. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of writing a good program is planning it," Mosley says. "If you 
do the design work right, you shouldn't have a major problem debugging it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause of the errors and omissions, finding and correcting them in 
a PC software program these days isn't always completed before the program is 
released for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Since the release last Halloween of dBase IV, analysts and users have 
complained that the 400,000-line program, perhaps the largest and most complex 
PC software product on the market today, is buggy -- a label that can be the 
kiss of death for any software product. 
</P>
<P>
The most publicized of the complaints focuses on problems with the program's 
new language for retrieving information stored in large databases; it seems 
that the language doesn't work as it should. Other lapses include the maddening 
fact that the program's instruction manual contains information that does not 
match the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is worse than the reality," says one Ashton-Tate executive, who 
asked not to be identified. "But unfortunately, perception always has a grain 
of truth to it . . . (and) the perception of bugs has dampened sales." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and even some Ashton-Tate insiders have said that many of the bugs are 
the result of the company's efforts to rush the product to market to protect 
its market position against hard-charging competitors. When the program -- the 
second major revision of top-selling dBase since its introduction in 1981 -- 
was released, it was already several months late because debugging efforts fell 
behind deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real sloppy programming, and they didn't test the program enough to 
catch it," says Tarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pervasive Problems 
</P>
<P>
Although Ashton-Tate's problems have attracted substantial publicity, dBase IV 
is hardly the only software infested with electronic pests. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Microsoft, the world's largest PC software publishing house, ran 
into persistent roadblocks in its efforts to debug two new versions of Word, a 
popular word-processing program for both the Apple Macintosh and IBM personal 
computers. The problems forced delays in shipments of the new product and 
ultimately caused the company to suffer a jolting and embarrassing profit 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
And over the years, Lotus Development Corp., publisher of the well-known Lotus 
1-2-3 spreadsheet, and Word Perfect Corp., whose word-processing program of the 
same name is a perennial top seller, have encountered bug problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pervasive problem for our industry," says Robert Franksten, chief 
scientist at Lotus Corp. "A lot of other businesses suffer from mistakes, but 
in the software industry, they seem to show up more readily." 
</P>
<P>
For software technicians, though, sometimes just getting the bugs to appear on 
a regular basis is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest bugs of all to correct, says Softview's Morgan, are those that 
appear reliably. Once a programmer knows how to trigger the bug, a correction 
is generally relatively easy, a matter of retracing the sequence of 
instructions in the program and rewriting the code when the problem appears. 
</P>
<P>
But what about those glitches that appear only sporadically and whose causes 
defy detection? 
</P>
<P>
Franksten still remembers the hellish time that he had in 1966 finding a bug in 
a program that he had written. The bug existed; there was no doubt of it. The 
program didn't work correctly. But finding the sequence of events that would 
trigger its appearance seemed impossible. A year after Franksten gave up the 
search, the bug reappeared by accident and was corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"The first trick is knowing why the bug exists at all," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most vexing of all are bugs that are tied to other bugs. If both bugs 
are present, the program works just fine. But if one bug is fixed, the other 
one shows up and fouls up the program. 
</P>
<P>
By far the vast majority of bugs in a typical program are discovered and fixed 
as it is written. Just as an author reads and rewrites his manuscript as he 
goes along, a software programmer typically runs and re-runs the code to ensure 
that it performs its intended tasks correctly. 
</P>
<P>
However, subtle errors take a bit of detective work. Consider the program that 
seems to work perfectly, but causes the computer to come up with a wrong 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tedious Process 
</P>
<P>
Software analyst Tarter recalls one program for which the rounding off of 
fractions was improperly coded. When the program operated with a relatively 
small amount of data, the results were not affected. But with huge quantities 
of data, the answers were seriously off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
In some subtle cases, the computer operator knows that there is a problem, but 
its origin is so masked by layers of programming and interaction that only a 
careful scrutiny of a "data dump" can uncover it. 
</P>
<P>
In this procedure, programmers pour over reams of computer printouts of the 
program. Usually these are sequences of letters and numbers that bear 
absolutely no relationship to any known spoken language. The debugger's job, 
which can take thousands of hours, is to discover which sequence is out of 
whack. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most insidious bugs are those that merely cause a program to run more 
slowly than it should or, worse yet, to lose just a little bit of its memory 
each time it is operated. Such glitches might never be discovered. 
</P>

Even finding and fixing the apparent bugs doesn't guarantee that things will 
get better. Programmers say the more "fixes" that must be made in a program, 
the greater the likelihood of introducing new glitches when the corrections 
don't work with other portions of the program. This is particularly true in 
long, complex programs that have several interdependent parts.

"It's a tedious, difficult and thankless task," says Philippe Kahn, founder and 
president of Borland International, a Silicon Valley software publishing house. 
"But if debugging is a problem at a company, it can be an indication that 
something is more fundamentally wrong there."

Gerry Liu still winces at the greeting that he received in San Francisco after 
a trip abroad last winter: At the airport, a U.S. customs agent lectured him 
about Asian immigrants taking jobs from other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Not true -- the company that I founded created more jobs for 
Americans than it took away,' " the Taiwan native recalled recently. "It wasn't 
a pleasant conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Liu, president of Knights Technology in the San Francisco Bay Area, is not 
alone. Little noticed outside Northern California, a growing corps of high-tech 
entrepreneurs has emerged with roots that reach from America to the Far East. 
Like Liu, they are immigrants who were drawn to this country for economic 
opportunity, and they have found it. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, they also have given something back: Their firms -- more than 
500 in the San Francisco Bay Area -- have created thousands of jobs, enhanced 
the nation's competitiveness in high technology and spurred innovation. All 
together, they generate over $1 billion in sales, according to the Asian 
American Manufacturers Assn. in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting an actual commitment to build products in this country, and to 
build them the way they ought to be built," said Charles H. Nevil, a member of 
the California State World Trade Commission. "I think it's a very significant 
contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the entrepreneurs are ethnically Chinese, born in mainland China, 
Taiwan or Hong Kong. But unlike other Asian immigrants who have eked out 
livings in restaurants, laundries and grocery stores, these have entered 
America's mainstream via the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Many hold advanced degrees in physics, engineering and computer science from 
U.S. universities. They stayed here to work after graduation, mostly in the 
1970s and 1980s, and have since launched firms that run the spectrum of modern 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"I received the best education in the world," said Liu, 32, who has a Ph.D. 
degree in computer science from University of California, Berkeley and whose 
firm makes advanced equipment used to design semiconductors. "I want to stay 
here a long time and contribute my talent to the same society where I got it." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the group is diverse. Some of the entrepreneurs are more at 
home in American society than others are. Their command of English varies. Some 
always wanted to run their own companies, while others took the step only after 
feeling mistreated by Caucasian employers. Their companies vary from fledglings 
with just a handful of workers to established enterprises such as Everex, a 
personal computer maker with 1,900 employees. 
</P>
<P>
And many are starting to benefit from their connections in Taiwan and Hong 
Kong, where booming economies have touched off a wave of U.S.-bound investment 
money and transpacific business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing they have in common is that they have roots elsewhere," said 
Calbert Lai, a spokesman for the AAMA. "It's a tremendous boon to their 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they have more than that in common: They come from families in which 
scientific pursuits are held in high esteem. And science is a uniquely portable 
skill for immigrants, because it is a language that they can speak as fluently 
as native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Science is basically numbers and symbols," said Fred Wong, the Hong Kong-born 
vice president of Rapro Technology in Fremont, Calif. "It speaks a universal 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, in different areas of modern technology, the Asian-American 
entrepreneurs are making their presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast of San Francisco Bay in Milpitas, David S. Lee -- schooled in China, 
Taiwan, Argentina and the United States -- runs Qume, a maker of computer 
printers. At Pantronix in San Jose, employees of Chinese-born Stanley Wang 
build semiconductors used in the space shuttle. Expert Edge in Palo Alto -- 
headed by David Lam, an immigrant from South Vietnam and Hong Kong -- 
constructs devices used in robotics and other factory technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Of the many entrepreneurs, few have strived harder or journeyed farther than 
Lee, 52, whose early education had more to do with basic survival than advanced 
science. "We appreciate more about America than many Americans do," he said in 
a conference room at Qume, the company that he helped start in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
While growing up in war-torn China in the 1940s, his family was uprooted 13 
times. They eventually moved to Taiwan, but the island was painfully close to 
grim wartime memories: In 1951, the Lees took a 59-day voyage to Argentina. 
Settling in Buenos Aires, they started a Chinese restaurant and import business 
where Lee helped translate Spanish for his parents. 
</P>
<P>
His journey wasn't over: Lee studied engineering at Montana State University 
and later, while working in the private sector, helped develop a letter-quality 
computer printer system known as the daisy wheel. When Xerox bought Diablo 
Systems -- a company he co-founded, "I made my first million dollars," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret to Success 
</P>
<P>
The corporate world had disappointments, as well. Lee stayed on at Diablo after 
the sale but was passed over for a newly created executive post. In the 
following years, he helped found Qume, sold it to ITT for more than $10 million 
in personal profit and later bought it back from a different owner. Today he 
serves as Qume's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"For every company there is a secret of making money," said the executive. "If 
you find it and protect it, then you will make money." 
</P>
<P>
Like other Chinese, Lee is conscious of ethnic stereotypes in which 
Asian-Americans are pegged as hard-working, obedient and loyal, while lacking 
in the sort of strong leadership traits expected of top-level managers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they even considered me as a manager," he said of his superiors 
at the Xerox subsidiary more than 15 years ago. "Even today," he added, "some 
large companies have a problem with Asian-Americans as managers." 
</P>
<P>
But if the majority culture is not uniformly hospitable to Asian-Americans, 
many are learning to make strides with the help of each other. In the Bay Area, 
many of the high-tech entrepreneurs know each other, enjoying a built-in 
network that translates into new contacts, new business, even new companies. 
</P>
<P>
A typical case: Fred Wong met David Lam several years ago when Wong's job 
involved purchasing high-tech equipment from Lam's firm. Lam later introduced 
Wong to a Chinese-American executive at IBM who was launching his own 
enterprise in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wong is a vice president at Rapro Technology in Fremont, a 2-year-old 
firm that designs and makes equipment to produce advanced integrated circuits. 
Lam serves on the board. "David and I actually went to the same high school, 
though we didn't know it till after we talked about it," Wong recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overseas Ties 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Wong is quick to note, the significance of such personal 
contacts is not peculiarly Asian and in fact "is no different from any start-up 
company in Silicon Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, such contacts stretch across the Pacific, where the 
Asian-American capitalists have family and friends that date back to early 
school days. Amy F. Chung, a product marketing manager with Sun Microsystems in 
Mountain View, Calif., makes no secret of her wish to make use one day of 
Taiwan-U.S. business links in a venture of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"Who you know is very important. The connections you have are very important," 
said Chung, 28, the daughter of a former Taiwanese consul general in San 
Francisco. "As a marketing person, I would just hit myself over the head if I 
cannot utilize these opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the immigrant entrepreneurs, opportunity is knocking in the form of 
cash. In April, for example, Taiwan's Bank of Communications -- a national 
industrial development bank -- opened its first U.S. office in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
"In California alone, there's at least a dozen (non-Japanese) Asian venture 
capital groups investing in high-tech businesses," said Robert E. Mast, 
director of corporate services for Venture Economics Inc., a private research 
firm in Needham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and other financial institutions aren't the only sources of Asian cash. 
More and more, entrepreneurs tell stories of rich individuals in Taiwan and 
Hong Kong buying stakes in fledgling, private enterprises. The amount of such 
money is unknown, because there is little way to track it. "These are family 
dollars," said William E. Claggett, San Jose's director of economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Through their personal contacts, some of the Asian-American capitalists have 
special entree to such families. The link has become more important lately, 
because many U.S. investors have become wary about gambling on high tech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Got Foreign Funds 
</P>
<P>
"The first instinct is to look to the guy down the street (for financing)," 
said Lam. But these days, when the guy down the street isn't interested, some 
of the Asian-Americans look across the ocean. Thus, one new company making 
electronics testing equipment turned to the Far East for critically needed 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
"In an industry that no U.S. venture company would touch with a 10-foot pole, 
they raised $4.5 million from Taiwan," said Lam, who started his current firm, 
Expert Edge, in April with the help of $2.5 million from a Hong Kong family. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such examples, Asian-American entrepreneurs still maintain that it's 
ideal to be "color-blind" when making business decisions. They are especially 
sensitive to any suggestion that they operate in business as an ethnically 
closed circle. 
</P>
<P>
At Pantronix, for instance, half of the managers are Asian-American; the other 
half are not, said Stanley Wang, the firm's president and founder: "We can work 
as a team -- to improve the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
Rapro regularly employs local, non-Asian machine shops to produce some of its 
parts. When Asian-American contractors have asked for some of that work, "we've 
told them we're satisfied with the (non-Asian) people we're working with, and 
if there are any opportunities, we'll let you know," Wong recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It's likely that in the future there will be more opportunities in Asia. Amy 
Chung tells the story of a friend who recently quit his California research job 
for a chance to work in a more sophisticated laboratory -- back home in Taiwan. 
"Just 10 years ago you wouldn't see him go back -- because there wasn't the 
opportunity for him to do what he wants to do," she observed. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, America remains the beacon for some of the Far East's most 
able high-tech entrepreneurs, drawn to this country's universities, business 
climate and political stability. "We have so much freedom in this country," 
said Lee, who remembers climbing walls in Beijing's Forbidden City when he was 
a child. "Every time you come back from a foreign country, you say, 'How lucky 
we are.' "

U.S. SOUNDS AN ECONOMIC CALL TO ARMS

<P>
The sleek, camouflaged F-16 fighter jet taxis onto the apron, revs its engine 
one more time and, with an ear-piercing scream, roars down the 12,000-foot 
runway and angles up into the bright Texas sky. 
</P>
<P>
To Steve Barter, test pilot for General Dynamics Corp., the plane's builder, it 
is a sweet sound. "The best fighter aircraft around," he says with pride. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese think so, too. Their decision to develop an advanced fighter of 
their own, relying heavily on F-16 technology borrowed from the United States, 
set off a bitter controversy that centered on a single airplane but laid bare a 
fundamental shift in America's role in world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Containment of Communism 
</P>
<P>
For more than four decades after World War II, the United States routinely 
subordinated its narrow economic interests to broad diplomatic and military 
objectives -- mainly, the containment of communism. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. When Japan proposed to build its own fighter, the FSX, the economic 
implications overshadowed military concerns. Critics said Japan would use the 
technology to develop its own civilian aircraft industry and dislodge the 
United States as the world's No. 1 manufacturer of airliners -- one of the few 
technological fields it still dominates. So federal officials reopened the FSX 
deal and obtained new guarantees from the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The government's handling of the FSX affair represents a major turning point in 
U.S. policy. Converging circumstances -- a relaxed Soviet military menace and 
mounting economic competition from Japan -- are eroding longstanding U.S. 
doctrines of free trade and economic altruism. Americans are becoming less 
concerned about the Cold War and more concerned with the economic tug of war 
with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this FSX dispute is all about," said Robert Z. Lawrence, a 
specialist in international economics at the Brookings Institution, "a change 
from a geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union to a rivalry with Japan over 
economic issues." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts such as Lawrence have a name for the emerging view that the United 
States must protect its markets. They call it the "new economic nationalism." 
</P>
<P>
Economic nationalism embraces trade protectionism in a variety of forms and 
encourages an active role in promoting American industry in the increasingly 
competitive international marketplace. It is present now to a degree not seen 
since the 1920s and the early years of the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times-Mirror poll found that most American voters now regard the 
Japanese economic juggernaut, not Soviet political expansionism, as the 
greatest threat to national security. Another poll, taken by the Yankelovich 
firm for Time magazine and Cable News Network, found that 76% of the voters see 
Japan's success in world trade as a threat to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cold Peace with Japan is replacing the Cold War with the Soviet Union," 
said Alan Webber, managing editor of the Harvard Business Review. "Just as 
America's strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union provided a global 
framework for the period between 1945 and 1990, so America's strategy for 
dealing with Japan will create a new framework for geoeconomics in the 21st 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over how the United States should respond to the challenge from 
Japan and other new economic powers has divided U.S. business and political 
leaders into two camps. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are those who contend that the United States and Japan can forge a 
partnership to replace the outdated relationship that enabled Japan -- and 
Western Europe as well -- to rise to prosperity under America's wing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Edged Sword 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for many of those who want to enhance U.S.-Japanese ties, the FSX 
project was just another opportunity to build what Mike Mansfield, a former 
U.S. ambassador to Tokyo, called "the world's most important bilateral 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a 
senior adviser to George Bush during last year's presidential campaign, said of 
the two nations: "The strengths of one compensate for the weaknesses of the 
other. Working together ever more closely, they can assure for themselves 
unrivaled global economic, financial and technological leadership." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue, those who believe Japan is bent on winning an 
all-out industrial competition want to sharpen the brewing conflict. 
</P>
<P>
They advocate an aggressive policy of "managed trade" by which Washington would 
limit Japanese penetration of the American market and force Japan to guarantee 
U.S. firms a share of its own market. By this view, police Sgt. Joseph 
Jablonski of television's "Hill Street Blues" had the right idea when he said: 
"Let's do it to them before they do it to us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard-Liners at Fore 
</P>
<P>
This side is enjoying increasing political clout. The Ronald Reagan 
Administration, for all its free-trade rhetoric, doubled the proportion of U.S. 
imports subject to various forms of protection even as calls for trade relief 
poured in from dozens of industries pinned to the wall by the strong dollar of 
the early 1980s. Congress last year enacted a trade law that increases pressure 
on the Administration to pursue unilateral retaliation -- rather than use 
existing international dispute-settlement machinery -- to seek redress of 
American trade complaints. 
</P>
<P>
More particularly, after Reagan's State and Defense departments and Japan had 
reached agreement on the FSX, Congress and President Bush's own Commerce 
Department forced the new Administration to renegotiate the deal for terms more 
favorable to U.S. business. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that Reagan's foreign policy advisers, in their eagerness to 
maintain longstanding national security ties with Japan, had agreed to give 
away technology that Japan could use to challenge U.S. dominance in civilian 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration obtained guarantees that Japan would allocate 40% of 
any FSX production contracts -- not just development work -- to American firms, 
and would pass on to the United States any new technology derived from the FSX 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostile Resolution 
</P>
<P>
Even that was not enough for Congress, which later passed a resolution urging 
that Japan be denied the technology needed to produce the FSX engine. 
</P>
<P>
Bush last week vetoed the resolution, a step that risks further backlash in 
Congress. Not only did a majority of both houses support the resolution, some 
congressmen opposed it because it was not tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
In the hard-liners' camp was Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House 
majority leader, who tried unsuccessfully to make economic nationalism an issue 
when he ran for President in 1988. He believes his approach is now catching 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of groups come to town that three years ago were stoutly free-trade and 
didn't even want to talk about a change in trade policy," Gephardt said. "Now, 
they literally are talking about (industrial) extinction. They want us to act." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is general battle fatigue over America's trade deficit. The 
gap has been narrowing steadily for two years, but not fast enough to satisfy 
Gephardt and many other lawmakers. Even though a trade deficit with Western 
Europe has been turned into a surplus, U.S. imports from Japan still exceed 
exports by roughly $50 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Yellow Peril' Theory 
</P>
<P>
But there is a deeper cause -- the fear that the United States is losing 
control of its own economic destiny. David Boaz, a senior official at the 
Washington-based Cato Institute, a free-market think tank, warned of a 
xenophobic campaign against the latest "yellow peril." 
</P>
<P>
"People feel this need for a devil figure, and if the Russians are fading as 
the enemy, it looks like we will try to find a substitute," he said. "The 
Japanese are coming up fast." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the new national obsession are everywhere. People lament that foreign 
investors -- particularly Japanese -- are "buying up" America. Policy-makers 
fret that Western Europe's plan to form a single market by 1992 will shut out 
U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce under Reagan and now a trade 
specialist with a Washington law firm, suggested that economic nationalism is 
going to "take over and color everything we do. This is a lens through which 
all major deals will be viewed." 
</P>
<P>
The new economic nationalism has sprung from disenchantment with the economic 
world order that the United States itself created after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postwar Policy Recalled 
</P>
<P>
Charles Kindleberger, the eminent Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
economist, served in Europe as a young State Department strategist during that 
period. Even before the first Allied troops had crossed the Rhine or entered 
Tokyo Bay, he said, the United States had begun fashioning postwar security and 
economic policy based on the belief that the best way to prevent another 
outbreak of war was to help restore prosperity to a devastated world. 
</P>
<P>
In defiance of those who demanded destruction of the enemy, the United States 
would help war-ravaged Germany and Japan get back on their feet. America would 
place its commercial interests second to global prosperity. At the same time, 
it would use its military might to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Kindleberger said those postwar policies proved to be "one of our great success 
stories." Both Japan and West Germany have risen from the rubble to become 
economic superpowers -- nose-to-nose competitors with the United States. Newly 
industrialized countries that America helped nurture, such as Taiwan and South 
Korea, have turned into economic tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts say they expect to see further changes in the next decade, on a 
scale not seen since the 1940s. Japan, they believe, will assume a more 
dominant role as an economic leader. The Asian "tigers" will continue to 
develop rapidly and the socialist world will turn more toward free markets. 
Europe will become more united economically than at any time since Charlemagne. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs at the Summit 
</P>
<P>
The recent economic summit in Paris, for all its surface calm, appeared to mark 
a significant turning point for the United States. It was clear that America no 
longer has the clout or the funds to lead the world around by the nose, and 
European leaders were demanding a part in shaping global policies. 
</P>
<P>
These changes are breeding uncertainty in the United States even as the 
stubborn trade deficit -- the most obvious manifestation of this nation's 
new-found difficulty in competing in the global economic arena -- refuses to go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts agree that so-called unfair trade practices are responsible for 
only a small part of the deficit, which was narrowed to $119 billion last year 
from a record $152 billion the year before. Even Japan has all but eliminated 
most of its formal trade barriers, although its archaic product-distribution 
system, interlocking corporate directorates and political practices still push 
consumers overwhelmingly to favor domestic products over foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough to Buy 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the trade deficit largely grows out of stark differences in economic 
practices here and abroad. The Japanese and most European nations chalk up 
trade surpluses largely because they are unable to invest all their savings at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, on the other hand, continue to spend more than they can produce, 
forcing the nation to make up the difference through imports of goods and 
capital. Americans save relatively little of their riches, leaving not quite 
enough to finance the business expansion needed to produce more goods for 
export. Moreover, even after substantial gains in recent years, many U.S. firms 
still do not seek markets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the dollar even started to rebound, thus making U.S. goods more 
expensive in world markets, and many experts fear that the trade gap will widen 
again. "We are running out of nostrums," Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) complained. 
</P>
<P>
As political pressures to get tough on trade mount, the Bush Administration 
seems unsure of how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protectionist Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, beating the drums of economic 
nationalism, has gone on the warpath against Japanese economic practices. 
Although he has been forced to back off from plans for new subsidies for the 
development of high-definition television and other advanced technologies, 
Mosbacher remains at the forefront of those promoting government support of 
U.S. industry -- lifting antitrust restrictions, continuing protection of the 
steel industry and demanding that Europe consult with the Administration in an 
effort to ward off measures that might impede U.S. firms after its internal 
barriers come down in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Anderson Hills, Bush's trade negotiator, has pressed for vigorous 
enforcement of last year's trade act, although she insists that she is not 
trying to restrict foreign entry to America's vast marketplace. "Our trade 
strategy is to open markets, to expand and liberalize trade and to adopt clear 
and enforceable rules," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue, Michael J. Boskin, top White House economist, 
warns that efforts to manage trade with the rest of the world could get out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wind up with a series of these retaliatory measures with our trade 
partners," he said, "it will not only cause a recession in the United States, 
it will cause a worldwide recession."

Rivals Singled Out 
</P>
<P>
Boskin made that comment shortly before Bush settled a protracted internal 
debate over how tough to be in applying the new trade law. The President chose 
to single out Japan, Brazil and India for retaliatory measures because those 
countries had refused to lower barriers against U.S. goods. The U.S. action, 
still to be determined, is to be imposed only if subsequent negotiations fail. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably, retaliation of any sort is growing less effective as the rapid global 
reach of business and technology erases the limits that national boundaries 
once imposed on international trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and foreign multinational corporations -- from giants such as IBM and 
Honda to entrepreneurial upstarts such as Sun Microsystems and Liz Claiborne -- 
are so widely dispersed around the globe that it is difficult to say whether 
they are American or foreign. 
</P>
<P>
"The spectacular decline in the cost of moving goods, people and -- especially 
-- information across national borders has left governments with little room 
for unilateral action and little choice but to find changed forms of mutual 
accommodation," contends retired Harvard economist Raymond Vernon, co-author of 
the recent book, "Beyond Globalism." 
</P>
<P>
And some analysts regard the trade deficit not as a sign of weakness, but as an 
inevitable byproduct of the billions of dollars in foreign currency that flow 
into the safest and most reliably profitable center of investment in the world 
-- the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"International capital markets are now some 15 times larger and many times more 
efficient than goods markets," said George Gilder, a free-market economist 
about to publish a book on the changing face of the microelectronics industry. 
"Capital thus dominates trade in international exchange. As long as capital can 
flow to the best opportunities anywhere in the world, trade can balance between 
any two countries only by accident." 
</P>
<P>
Harald B. Malmgren, a Washington-based trade consultant, is convinced that the 
nation's flirtation with economic nationalism gives way to global markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Globalism will override nationalism no matter what the government does," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Japan's fighter jet project remains the most vivid 
reflection of economic nationalism to date. Although the Bush Administration 
negotiated a better deal, some analysts complained that the long-term 
consequences will not be in America's interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regrets on Reneging 
</P>
<P>
Reneging on the original deal, said James Abegglen, president of Asia Advisory 
Services Ltd., a Tokyo-based consulting group, has seriously damaged 
U.S.-Japanese relations. 
</P>
<P>
"America looks as though it won't keep an agreement," Abegglen said. To the 
Japanese, he said, Washington's apparent petulance over the FSX deal "looks 
like weakness." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Japanese were so stung by congressional reaction to the 
original FSX deal that they are quietly beginning to step up their own military 
development plans out of fear that mistrust in the United States will 
jeopardize future transfers of U.S. technology to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as the FSX episode demonstrated, economic nationalism is fast catching up 
with national security considerations as a driving force behind the formulation 
of U.S. policy around the world. The consequences, like the sound of an F-16 
that has already disappeared over the horizon, are certain to linger for years 
to come.

NAGASAKI: RELUCTANT ACTOR IN ROLE OF ATOMIC MARTYR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

NAGASAKI, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cicadas hum furiously from the branches of a grove of cherry trees in a small, 
simple park that marks The Spot. About 1,800 feet overhead, on a hot morning 
like this one 44 summers ago, history visited Nagasaki with a horrific flash 
and a boom. 
</P>
<P>
The decades have passed, but Nagasaki still struggles to remember, to forget 
and to get on with life. 
</P>
<P>
Hypocenter Park is characteristic of the city's ambivalence about its past. A 
casual visitor might stroll the length of it without noticing a sleek, black 
monolith at Ground Zero, or see a nearby corner littered with an odd assortment 
of nuclear junk. Signs identify the debris: a warped water tank from Keiho 
Middle School, a mangled I-beam from Mitsubishi Steel Works, a ruined wall from 
Urakami Catholic Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
The tale is familiar. Three days after the first atomic weapon was detonated 
over Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, an American B-29 bomber dropped a second 
nuclear device, a 22-kiloton plutonium bomb irreverently named "Fat Man," on 
Nagasaki, taking more than 70,000 lives and hastening Japan's surrender in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But the story of the atomic legacy left to the city of Nagasaki is more 
difficult to grasp. Compared to Hiroshima, where twice as many people were 
killed, Nagasaki's martyrdom is pensive and melancholy. Hiroshima has for years 
boldly promoted itself as an international peace capital, and in the process 
spawned what might be called "nuclear tourism," drawing more than 100,000 
foreign visitors each year to its sprawling, elaborate Peace Memorial Park and 
museum complex. 
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki has followed suit, but somewhat reluctantly and on a smaller scale. 
Japan's foremost Christian city, by dint of its association with Portuguese 
traders and Roman Catholic missionaries in the late 16th Century, it has been 
far less strident in its anti-nuclear appeal. People in this city like to cite 
the aphorism: "Hiroshima in anger, Nagasaki in prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while Hiroshima is in the midst of a highly publicized campaign to 
raise $1.5 million in donations to repair and maintain its signature "atomic 
dome" ruins, Nagasaki is tearing down what remains of the scattered public 
school buildings that survived the blast. Ostensibly, this is for safety 
reasons, but many of the city's 450,000 citizens would seemingly just as soon 
let go of the burden of history. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for a few old people who survived it, nobody in Nagasaki really cares 
about the atomic bomb," said Tokio Kankeko, 40, proprietor of a coffeehouse 
near the city's Chinatown district. "People want to forget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors the Wrecking Ball 
</P>
<P>
Hirotake Ejima, 47, a local salaried worker, said he considers the bomb a vital 
part of history but still favors the wrecking ball for the old school buildings 
identified with the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no denying what happened, but we should move forward with life," Ejima 
said. "We're all for peace, but if you cling to the past, it's only going to 
deepen the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
For some, however, the wounds never will heal. Kazuko Nagase, 51, was 7 when 
she was stunned by a burst of yellow light and saw her wooden house come 
tumbling down on top of her. She escaped serious injury and was spared the 
searing burns that disfigured many hibakusha, or atomic bomb victims. But she 
has suffered from kidney ailments and other symptoms of radiation sickness. 
Acute exhaustion has made it impossible for her to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's fatigue carries through until tomorrow, no matter how well I sleep at 
night," said Nagase, a tiny, stooped women with bow legs who for the last 14 
years has lived in a special home for hibakusha run by an order of Catholic 
nuns. "I think of the atomic bomb every day. If that hadn't happened, I 
wouldn't be living like this. I've been waiting more than 40 years to get back 
to normal again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distressed Over Plans 
</P>
<P>
Nagase is distressed that city officials are considering demolition of the 
elementary school she attended before the bombing, whose crumpled shell of 
reinforced concrete was repaired after the war and made serviceable. 
</P>
<P>
"If they take it down now, we'll lose an important thread," Nagase said. "There 
won't be anything to teach the children about the bomb. I hope they'll keep it, 
at least until I die." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, more than 300,000 people are believed to have lived through the 
conflagration and radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, though thousands are 
dying each year. The survivors' vivid accounts of death, chaos and panic 
dominate remembrances each August, when Japan goes through a ritual of 
re-examining the ghosts of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
As the victims' wounds are symbolically reopened, appeals for global 
disarmament are renewed. The country's splintered -- and extremely politicized 
-- peace movement moves into high gear at this time every year, with rival 
conferences and incessant resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints from Foreigners 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners frequently complain, as they walk away from the pacifist speeches 
and the displays in the atomic bomb museums, that the Japanese seem to believe 
that they were the war's primary victims. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Nagasaki's outspoken mayor, Hitoshi Motoshima, 67, advocates shifting 
the focus away from the "victim's consciousness" that permeates the 
anti-nuclear movement here and instead asking what Japan did to invite 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that when the atomic bombs were dropped, the people of the world 
applauded -- it was revenge against Japan's brutal aggression," Motoshima said. 
"The Nagasaki bomb has a lot of meanings, but one is that it all started at 
Pearl Harbor and ended right here." 
</P>
<P>
Motoshima, a Roman Catholic whose family is descended from Nagasaki's 
centuries-old sect of "hidden Christians," gained widespread notoriety last 
December by daring to say publicly -- in a speech marking the anniversary of 
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor -- that Emperor Hirohito bore some 
responsibility for the war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shattered Mood 
</P>
<P>
The statement brought Motoshima a series of death threats, but it also 
shattered a mood of restraint as Hirohito lay on his deathbed and underscored 
the fact that the Japanese seldom seriously debate the causes of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have a philosophy of neglect. We say, 'Put a lid on something 
that stinks,' " Motoshima said in a recent interview. "So more than 40 years 
have gone by, and we've dealt with all this through nonverbal communication. 
It's unspoken, and when it comes right down to it, the Japanese do not know 
what war is. Nobody knows what we did." 
</P>
<P>
People know what the Americans did, however. It is illustrated in graphic 
detail in the small museum run by the city near Nagasaki's Hypocenter Park, and 
on a grander scale in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. In the Hiroshima museum, 
foreign visitors may listen to a recorded guided tour in which a sonorous, 
British-accented male voice explains that the bomb was a "dreadful, genocidal 
weapon." Among the exhibits is a glass display case containing ghoulish wax 
figures of bomb victims, whose burnt skin is peeling off their hands and 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities, understandably, have special peace education programs in the 
schools to teach children about the horrors of nuclear war. But Fumio 
Yamashita, 23, a civil servant whose job it was to guide a visiting reporter 
through the Nagasaki A-bomb museum, conceded that he did not learn much about 
Japan's own acts of aggression while in school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silence on Causes of War 
</P>
<P>
"There really isn't much talk about the war in peace education," Yamashita 
said. "We didn't hear anything about what caused the war." 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing elements in the national government, particularly in the Education 
Ministry, meanwhile, are pushing a revisionist version of history that has 
increasingly worked its way into the textbooks used in public schools. Among 
the revisionist theories gaining credence is that the United States forced 
Japan into war by cutting off its access to oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Japan's nuclear phobia shows no signs of abating. A furor 
resulted in May with disclosures that an A-4E Skyhawk plane carrying a 
one-megaton hydrogen bomb rolled off the American aircraft carrier Ticonderoga 
off Okinawa in 1965. The plane and bomb were never recovered and are believed 
to have sunk -- harmlessly -- in waters 16,000 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Ticonderoga later made a port call at Yokosuka, near Tokyo, critics 
said the incident was solid evidence of a pattern in which the United States, 
then and since, has routinely introduced nuclear weapons into Japanese 
territory despite the "three non-nuclear principles" declared for Japan by 
former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato in 1968: not to produce, possess or store 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Grist for Indignation 
</P>
<P>
It has long been an open secret, confirmed publicly by former U.S. Ambassador 
Edwin O. Reischauer, that American ships have carried nuclear weapons into 
Japanese ports without first consulting with Japanese authorities, as required 
under the U.S.-Japanese security pact. Still, the Ticonderoga incident provided 
grist for fresh indignation, perhaps in that it exposed a predilection for 
ostrich-like avoidance in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The government's position has been that because it receives no advance 
consultation, it assumes that the United States is not introducing nuclear 
weapons to Japanese waters or violating the non-nuclear principles. The United 
States will neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki's mayor, Motoshima, advocates giving some sort of legal status to the 
"principles." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't leave it vague forever," Motoshima said. "The government has got to 
make efforts to clarify" how the protocols are in fact observed. "And once the 
true situation is clarified, we must have realistic discussions on what is 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Takeshi Araki of Hiroshima would go a step further: Let the cities of the 
world take the initiative. Araki and Motoshima are currently co-hosting an 
international conference of "Mayors for Peace," which coincides with the A-bomb 
anniversaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the cities and local governments that bear ultimate responsibility for 
the safety and welfare of their residents," Araki said in an interview. "We 
can't leave it up to nations anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But asked what concrete actions these cities might take to ensure peace, Araki 
was, in a word, vague.

GAMBLES HAVEN'T ALWAYS PAID OFF;

<P>
FINANCE PROFILE PAINTS BRADLEY AS RISK-TAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FREED, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has lived rent-free for 12 years in a French Colonial mansion 
owned by the city. Similarly, taxpayers provide Bradley with a chauffeur and 
other domestic staff and pick up the tab for his utilities, which last year 
averaged more than $750 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and supporters supply the mayor with most of his lunches and dinners, 
and with his clothes. He receives free tickets to Dodger Stadium -- the seats 
are right behind the home team dugout -- and passes to other entertainment 
events. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such perquisites, Los Angeles' mayor receives a $97,654 annual 
salary, a $63,000 expense account and, last year, nearly $50,000 in other 
income, including $42,000 in fees earned as an adviser to two banks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, all of this has left the five-term mayor with thousands of 
dollars in disposable income -- money to invest. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's problem, according to experts who have reviewed a synopsis of 
documents charting his personal finances, is that he has not invested it very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor may well be a millionaire, The Times found that his net 
worth has been stunted by numerous highly speculative and ultimately 
less-than-successful investments. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have opened a preliminary inquiry into Bradley's stock 
transactions, apparently exploring whether he was given access to insider 
information. Bradley has denied any wrongdoing and refused to publicly discuss 
his personal finances until the investigations into his investments and 
possible conflict of interest are complete. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1963, when he was first elected to public office, Bradley has bought or 
sold at least five pieces of real estate while trading in nearly 30 different 
securities, including oil companies, savings and loans, an auto parts firm and 
toy manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Any estimate of Bradley's net worth would be rough, given the vague reporting 
requirements for California politicians. Based only on personal financial data 
that he is required to report, however, it would appear that he has accumulated 
at least $679,000 to $1.5 million, including two small houses that the mayor 
owns in Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Had he been more prudent in his investments, according to three professional 
financial specialists who were asked by The Times to independently assess 
Bradley's portfolio, it is likely that he would be worth far more today. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a handful of real estate deals -- the majority involving 
property that Bradley acquired from financially distressed relatives -- few of 
his investments have been the kind that analysts would deem successful or 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
From investments in talking teddy bears to avocado groves in Temecula, the 
operative word in the mayor's portfolio has been risk. Not one blue-chip stock. 
Not one mutual fund. Not one municipal bond. 
</P>
<P>
It is, according to experts, the investment profile of an aggressive speculator 
willing to risk principal in the hope of making a killing. It is also a profile 
that clashes with Bradley's reputation as a man of patience and circumspection. 
</P>
<P>
"Bradley has this image of being very cautious, the kind of person who would be 
happy with a 6% return on a certificate of deposit," said Mitchell Keil, a 
financial planner with IDS Financial Services in Irvine. "But looking at where 
he's put his money over the years, you'd swear that this is a man who likes to 
drive Corvettes at a hundred miles an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is the kind of adventuresome attitude that even the mayor's wife 
might find difficult to believe. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Ethel Bradley pointed out that her husband is such a 
model of thrift that he refuses to drop so much as a nickel in a slot machine 
when visiting Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bradley, his wife of 48 years said, "would never gamble." 
</P>
<P>
Records show that in 1980 the mayor sank about $15,000 into two companies 
marketing a highly speculative line of innovative slot machines and electronic 
poker games. The companies, Interscience Systems Inc. of Canoga Park and its 
subsidiary, Summit Systems, also were seeking a share of a gambling casino 
license with Playboy Enterprises in Atlantic City, N.J. Both companies failed 
about three years later and Bradley lost virtually all of his investment, 
according to records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendships and Contacts 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, Bradley's investments have been built on friendships, social 
acquaintances and political contacts. Not all of those relationships have 
served him well financially. 
</P>
<P>
"Bradley is what we would call a 'story,' " said Joseph D. Vinso, a USC 
economics professor and former financial analyst for Dow Chemical Co. "Somebody 
has a story about a good investment and the investor buys it without checking 
it out. He figures, 'What can I lose?' Well, he can lose a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Consider Bradley's purchase in March, 1986, of $100,000 in "junk" bonds in 
Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan Assn., underwritten by the stock brokerage of 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, with whom the mayor had a trading account. Bradley sold 
the bonds in January, apparently at a loss of between $70,000 and $80,000, just 
before the ailing Gibraltar was seized by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mediocre ... Results' 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to make money aggressively," observed Maurice Weiss, a former 
Drexel broker who now works as an independent financial adviser. "He's a nice 
man who's . . . had mediocre investment results." 
</P>
<P>
Consider Bradley's participation in CZI and CZII, two limited partnerships 
formed in 1980 to buy raw land in Rancho California in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The partnerships were organized by Charles Z. Wilson, then a vice chancellor at 
UCLA and a longtime friend of Bradley. Nine partners each committed about 
$25,000 to buy the property. The participants ranged from the mayor to Mary 
Jane Hewitt, the former head of UCLA's black studies department, to Xavier 
Gonzales-Goenaga, an insurance broker living in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, part of the property was sold, resulting in a loss to each investor of 
about $8,000. The remaining land, for which the partners have paid more than 
$250,000 in mortgages, taxes and other expenses, was appraised two years ago at 
$110,000, according to one partner, Juanita St. John. The partnerships have 
since been renamed Kathy St. John I and II, after St. John's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task Force Appointment 
</P>
<P>
"If you get someone to buy it," Juanita St. John joked, "I'll give you a 
commission." 
</P>
<P>
It was St. John whom Bradley in 1985 appointed to the Task Force for Africa/Los 
Angeles Relations, a group created to promote trade with Africa. Two weeks ago, 
City Atty. James K. Hahn filed criminal charges against St. John, alleging that 
she failed to heed a subpoena and deliver records to show how more than 
$180,000 in city funds under her control was spent. 
</P>
<P>
The land in Rancho California in which St. John and Bradley are involved is not 
far from an avocado grove in Temecula in which Bradley invested through another 
limited partnership, Green Gold XI, in November, 1975. At the time, 
agricultural investments offered considerable tax write-offs for individuals 
with high incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley put nearly $15,000 into Green Gold, according to Tom Levers, one of the 
firm's general partners. But in subsequent years, the avocado market grew soft, 
Levers said, and Congress did away with most of the tax incentives for such 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bradley has held onto his shares, which Levers estimated to be worth 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another Green Gold official conceded, "It was not a good investment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Losers 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that all of Bradley's investments have lost money. Some, in 
fact, have been extremely well-timed. 
</P>
<P>
Worlds of Wonder, makers of the Teddy Ruxpin talking teddy bear, was one such 
investment. Bradley bought and sold less than $10,000 worth of stock in Worlds 
of Wonder in April, 1986, making a considerable profit. 
</P>
<P>
When he was first elected to the City Council in 1963 after 20 years as a Los 
Angeles police officer, Bradley had little more than a $19,000 tract house in 
Southwest Los Angeles to show for his public service. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next seven years, Bradley was named a founder in the Bank of Finance, 
California's first black-owned bank, and acquired four other modest properties 
that he took over from relatives who were financially strapped. Bradley turned 
tidy profits on each real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing the appearance of a conflict of interest after being elected mayor in 
1973, Bradley resigned from the board of the Bank of Finance. "I don't want 
that relationship raising any questions," he was quoted as saying at the time. 
</P>
<P>
It was a statement that would come back to haunt him this year amid disclosures 
that the mayor had received thousands of dollars in fees from two financial 
institutions that had dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Bradley moved into Getty House, the new mayor's residence that had 
been donated to the city the year before. The move, according to one source 
close to the mayor, proved a financial windfall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hardly a Rich Man' 
</P>
<P>
"You go to dinner with the mayor," said the source, "and all these people are 
coming up to him, slapping him on the back, saying, 'Hi, Mr. Mayor. Remember 
me? I have a company now. I want to give you a tip.' He's been hearing it all 
his life. So now he no longer has a house expense and he decides to start 
investing. He's done well on some things and (poorly) in others. He's hardly a 
rich man." 
</P>
<P>
Said one former Bradley aide: "This is a guy who still buys his socks in bulk." 
</P>
<P>
But there are critics who insist that the mayor has enriched himself through 
his elected position. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't give you things unless your hand is out," said former Mayor Sam 
Yorty, who remains bitter over the defeat Bradley handed him in 1973. "If you 
look at his income tax (return), you'll see he's a millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Available records, however, suggest that if Bradley is a millionaire, it is not 
by much.

Bradley still owns the three-bedroom, 1,282-square-foot house on Welland Avenue 
that he and his wife bought in 1950. It has a current estimated market value of 
about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the mayor holds title to another small, stucco-covered house on 
Somerset Drive, about a mile away, which he acquired in 1985 after agreeing to 
take over the mortgage payments and other expenses for in-laws living there. It 
is worth about $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives live rent-free in his other house as well. 
</P>
<P>
Until he sold it in March for $123,000, Bradley also owned a nearby bungalow on 
West 36th Place that he bought in 1969 and rented out. The rental property 
brought in less than $10,000 a year, according to Bradley's disclosure 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
As of January, when Bradley filed his last annual disclosure statement with the 
city clerk's office, he was involved in five stocks and seven partnerships, 
including the Temecula avocado groves and federally subsidized low-income 
apartment buildings in Mariposa and Paso Robles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sketchy Disclosures 
</P>
<P>
Still, disclosure requirements for public officials in California are 
sufficiently broad that, without other sources of information, it is all but 
impossible to determine how much money Bradley may have invested in a 
particular security. 
</P>
<P>
The annual statements of economic interests simply require the name of the 
business entity, the date the shares were bought or sold, and whether the 
amount of the investment is between $1,000-$10,000, $10,001-$100,000 or more 
than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in 11 of the 12 corporations or partnerships listed on his 1989 
statement of economic interests, Bradley simply reports holdings of between 
$10,001-$100,000 in each -- a portfolio that could be worth anywhere from 
$110,011 to $1.1 million. As for the 12th investment, Bradley reported a 
December, 1987, purchase of $1,000-$10,000 in Greenwich Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
It is also conceivable that Bradley holds thousands of dollars in other assets 
that by law he does not have to report. Public officials in California need not 
disclose bank certificates of deposit, money earned from interest-bearing 
accounts, real estate outside their immediate jurisdiction, inheritances or 
proceeds from the sale of commodities futures, among other exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Undisclosed Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
The Times checked real estate records throughout California, Nevada, Arizona 
and several other selected states but could find no properties that Bradley had 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is at least one indication that the mayor has money in a 
non-reportable asset. On one of his recent statements of economic interest, 
Bradley indicated having a 9% loan of more than $10,000 with Far East National 
Bank. The loan, according to Bradley's disclosure statement, is secured by a 
certificate of deposit, the size of which is not described. 
</P>
<P>
The California Fair Political Practices Commission has ordered Bradley to 
provide greater detail on his 1984-88 financial disclosure statements. Bradley 
is expected this week to release the precise dates on which he bought or sold 
certain stocks but has indicated that he will not reveal how much stock was 
involved in each transaction. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bradley's $10,001-$100,000 investments is in Valley Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. Since 1978, Bradley received as much as $24,000 a year as a 
paid adviser to the thrift while it did business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor last year also received about $18,000 in fees as an adviser to Far 
East National Bank, which also had dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigations Under Way 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are investigating whether Bradley's relationships with Valley 
Federal and Far East posed any illegalities. The mayor also faces an inquiry by 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his Drexel investments. The 
California Fair Political Practices Commission, meanwhile, is looking into 
allegedly unlawful votes Bradley cast as chairman of the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has subsequently resigned his positions with Far East and Valley 
Federal, announced that he will place his assets in a blind trust and grown 
silent over his personal finances, leaving many investments shrouded in 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
His involvement in Peiming Co. and Elree Co. may be among the murkiest. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor on Oct. 6, 1987, invested between $20,000 and $200,000 in the two 
companies, which California secretary of state records indicate are 
interrelated partnerships, specializing in real estate. Real estate records 
show that neither company holds any property anywhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
The chief financial officer in Peiming is Chi Hsing Pei, who is also a partner 
in a company that has a lucrative city contract to run gift stands at Los 
Angeles International Airport. Authorities are auditing the company, Duty Free 
Shoppers Group Ltd., to determine whether there were any improprieties in 
issuance of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Offices 
</P>
<P>
The offices of Peiming and Elree are on the 15th floor of an office building at 
3200 Wilshire Blvd. There is no listing for either company in the lobby 
directory. There are no names on the locked door to the office, which a 
spokeswoman for the building's management company said has been leased for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the nicely furnished, one-room office is an autographed photo of Bradley 
posing with a woman. The same woman was sitting in the office. On the desk at 
which she sat is a plaque engraved with the name Chi Hsing Pei. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, however, would not identify herself and denied association with 
Peiming or Elree. She would not discuss the companies because, she said, "they 
are private." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what her relationship was with Bradley, she said: "No relationship. I'm 
in the community. He's our mayor." 
</P>
<P>
According to records, Duty Free Shoppers, in which Pei is a partner, was 
granted contracts at the airport under programs intended to aid disadvantaged 
businesses owned and operated by women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dixon Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
In June, it was disclosed that another partner in Duty Free Shoppers is Betty 
Dixon, wife of U.S. Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House 
Ethics Committee. Records show that Betty Dixon, who had invested less than 
$15,000 in Duty Free Shoppers, collected at least $150,000 in profits from the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has said that he has no involvement in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to better determine the sources of Bradley's outside income, The Times 
in early July requested that the mayor provide a copy of his most recent income 
tax return. He rejected the request. Bradley also declined a later request that 
he reveal his adjusted gross income for 1988 as reported to the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Many other elected officials, President Bush and California Gov. George 
Deukmejian among them, routinely make public their tax returns to dispel 
concerns over potential conflicts of interest and other improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Matters 
</P>
<P>
"Matters between the IRS and a taxpayer are private," said Bradley's spokesman, 
Bill Chandler. "The same is true with the mayor as with any other citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley last disclosed his tax return seven years ago. He was running for 
governor against Deukmejian and was goaded into disclosure by his Republican 
rival. Bradley's 1981 tax return showed that the mayor and his wife declared 
$93,645 in adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley later complained that the information had been "abused" by his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
City records show that in salary alone, Bradley will earn $97,654 this year and 
another $12,413 in pension for his past service as a Los Angeles police 
officer. Among other fringe benefits, the city will put $17,510 into a second 
pension that Bradley will receive when he is no longer mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expense Account 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also has at his disposal a $63,000 expense account that he uses 
primarily to pay for trips abroad intended to promote Los Angeles. In fiscal 
1987-88, Bradley's expenses totaled $45,355. 
</P>
<P>
There are other benefits that add to the mayor's disposable income: 
</P>
<P>
* He lives rent-free in Getty House, the 6,338-square-foot, 14-room mayor's 
mansion in Hancock Park donated to the city in 1976 by Getty Oil Co. Tax money 
pays for the full-time custodian, gardener and butler who work there. 
</P>
<P>
* His gas, electricity and water bills are paid by the city. During the last 
fiscal year, utilities at Getty House came to $9,204, according to city 
records. 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, Bradley reported receiving free passes to Dodgers, Lakers and 
Kings games, the Greek Theatre, Disneyland, the Academy Awards and every major 
movie theater chain, among others. Together the passes were worth $9,218. 
</P>
<P>
* He is provided a Los Angeles police bodyguard/driver and a 1987 Oldsmobile 
Regency, which cost $19,170 new, with a $700 cellular phone. The city pays for 
the car's maintenance as well as the $38 monthly fee for the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
* Much of Bradley's wardrobe has been donated to him by various tailors and 
benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, records show, Bradley has received at least 11 custom-made suits 
worth $8,025. In the same period, he has been given an undetermined number of 
custom-made shirts valued at $2,790, and $180 in neckties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Mayor's Shoes 
</P>
<P>
He also has received at least nine pairs of shoes valued at $2,200. Six of 
those were given to Bradley by Pasquale DiFabrizio, an Italian immigrant and 
self-proclaimed "shoemaker to the stars." 
</P>
<P>
One wall of DiFabrizio's shop near the Beverly Center is covered with hundreds 
of photographs of him posing with celebrities who wear his custom-made 
footwear. Bradley's picture hangs just above Kirk Douglas' and just below Liza 
Minnelli's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Democrat," the affable DiFabrizio explained when asked why the mayor 
gets his shoes free. "The past few years, he no show up, but he still sends me 
Christmas cards. Any time he wants new shoes, I'm happy to give him. He does a 
good job for the city." 
</P>

BRADLEY'S INVESTMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Bradley's investment activity started slowly with small real estate 
purchases in the 1960s. After his election as mayor in 1971, his real estate 
investments expanded. After he moved into the mayor's official residence in 
1977, according to a source familiar with the mayor's personal finances, he 
began building a stock portfolio. Financial experts consulted by The Times say 
the mayor's net worth, today estimated at $679,000 to $1.5 million, could be 
much higher if he had invested more prudently. 
</P>
<P>
1960-69: Bradley invests $18,000 to $34,000 in California's first black-owned 
bank, Bank of Finance, which he helped form. Starts dabbling in real estate, 
purchasing a two-story house on South Catalina Street for $17,730 (sold three 
years later for $26,820) and a frame bungalow on West 36th Place (sold this 
year for $123,000). 
</P>
<P>
1970-74: In return for paying off a $1,000 debt for relatives, Bradley receives 
two vacant lots near Watts in the path of proposed Century Freeway. Later sells 
the lots to California Department of Transportation for $13,000. Pays a 
relative $25,000 for eight acres located along a road that three years later 
became the main thoroughfare into the state-owned Lake Perris Recreation Area 
in Riverside County. Sells land for $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
1975-79: By late 1970s, Bradley is involved with real estate partnerships. 
Invests $15,000 in a limited partnership that operates avocado groves in 
Riverside and Ventura counties and $25,000 in two low-income housing complexes. 
Puts $10,001-$100,000 in Drexel Burnham Lambert real estate partnership, which 
owns a resort hotel in South Carolina and an apartment complex in Florida. 
Invests $3,000 in Penril Corp. (data transmission equipment). 
</P>
<P>
1980-84: In 1980s, Bradley steps up trading in stocks. Puts less than $10,000 
in Summit Systems and $12,000 in Interscience Systems Inc. (futuristic slot 
machines) -- investments later reported as worthless. Also invests 
$15,000-$105,000 in Beverly Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, less than 
$10,000 in Valley Federal Savings and $10,001-100,000 in Metromedia debentures, 
a communications conglomerate. Puts $10,001-100,000 in limited partnerships 
that own raw land in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
1985-1989: New investments include less than $10,000 in Wickes Corp. 
(furniture) and in Discovery Oil Co., $10,001-$100,000 each in Coast Savings 
Common Stock and SCI Holdings Inc., a privately held company formed to take 
over Storer Communications and partly funded by Drexel Burnham Lambert junk 
bonds. Invests $100,000 in Gibraltar Savings, and loses about $80,000. Invests 
$10,001-$100,000 in Beatrice Foods one month before company is bought out by 
BCI Holding Inc. in a $6.2-billion leveraged buyout and later puts 
$10,001-100,000 into BCI. Other stock investments range from energy and 
pharmaceutical companies to toy companies -- less than $10,000 in Worlds of 
Wonder (Teddy Ruxpin talking teddy bears) and $10,001-$100,000 in Mattel toy 
manufacturing company.

STATEMENT DIMS HOPES FOR HOSTAGE DEAL WITH ISRAEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fundamentalist Hezbollah movement denied Saturday having any part in 
tentative feelers for a prisoner exchange with Israel, throwing a chill on 
faint prospects that the foreign hostages in Lebanon might be part of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
In a message directed pointedly at Jerusalem, the statement again disavowed any 
Hezbollah connection with the hostages or their Muslim extremist kidnapers and 
said that Israel's abduction of Shiite clergyman Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid "has 
ended all possibilities for an exchange." 
</P>
<P>
"The Zionist entity (Israel) has to understand that it has made a mistake," 
said the statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut. It 
specifically ruled out the release of three Israeli soldiers held captive in 
Lebanon. It did, however, specify five Palestinians whom Hezbollah wants the 
Israelis to free, along with Obeid and other Lebanese Shiites, without 
suggesting a trade in return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejection Reaffirmed 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah had rejected an offer made Monday by the Israeli government to 
exchange Obeid, two men kidnaped with him on July 28 and other Shiite prisoners 
in Israeli hands for the three Israeli soldiers and the foreign hostages, 
including eight Americans. Saturday's statement reaffirmed that rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Initial Israeli reaction was extremely guarded. "This is a war of nerves," 
Eitan Haber, spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, told The Times in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The message from Hezbollah (Party of God) appeared designed to deal the group 
out of any prospective negotiations on the hostages, at least publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"We affirm that Hezbollah has no direct or indirect links with the hostage 
issue and with negotiations concerning it," the message said. "The matter 
concerns only the kidnapers. Everyone knows that and knows how to get to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feverish Activity in Beirut 
</P>
<P>
However, in two days of feverish activity in Beirut since the threatened 
execution of American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio was suspended Thursday night, 
diplomats kept knocking at Hezbollah's door. On Friday, U.N. Undersecretary 
Marrack Goulding and Algerian officials met with Hezbollah's spiritual leader, 
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, in efforts to seek a resolution of the crisis 
that has mounted steadily since last Monday, when another American hostage, 
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was reported hanged by his radical Shiite 
captors. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of these contacts in Beirut came first in a midnight broadcast on 
Algerian state radio, followed by published reports on the comments of Khaled 
Hasnawi, Algeria's ambassador to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hasnawi, the radio reported, had taken part in a series of talks involving all 
hostages held in Lebanon, whether "Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans 
or Israelis." The Algerian envoy met with both Goulding and Fadlallah, whose 
fundamentalist organization, according to intelligence reports, maintains ties 
to the clandestine groups believed to be holding the foreign hostages. Reports 
from Beirut said that Red Cross representatives were also involved in the round 
of contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Without further elaboration, the broadcast said: "Progress in this mediation 
was accomplished Friday." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coincided With Iran Comments 
</P>
<P>
The activity in Beirut coincided with the declaration in Tehran by Iranian 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani that his government was prepared to play a role in 
resolving the hostage crisis. "I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon 
has solutions," the newly inaugurated Iranian leader said at Friday prayers. 
"The freeing of hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a cautious President Bush, commenting on Rafsanjani's remarks, 
said: "I'm encouraged, but I don't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved 
ones up once again to have those hopes dashed. This is a brutal process." 
</P>
<P>
In suspending the threatened execution of Cicippio, the Revolutionary Justice 
Organization declared it was acting out of "respect of the intervention by some 
states and sides that were asked by the United States to mediate." Iran, along 
with Syria, the Soviet Union, Algeria and a number of other countries, was on 
the list contacted by Washington officials in their efforts to spare Cicippio's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In related developments Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Goulding arrived in Damascus, the capital of Syria, which holds military 
sway over two-thirds of Lebanon with an army estimated at 40,000 troops. "I 
came here to explore what the United Nations might be able to do to help 
promote a final solution to the hostage crisis," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
An aide said the U.N. official plans to meet today with Syrian Foreign Minister 
Farouk Shareh and the visiting Salim Hoss, who heads a Sunni Muslim Cabinet in 
West Beirut, a rival government to the Christian Cabinet led by Maj. Gen. 
Michel Aoun in East Beirut. Goulding met earlier with Aoun in the Lebanese 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
"There does seem to be a widespread feeling that this hostage problem has got 
to be tackled fundamentally and this is the time to do it," Goulding said. 
</P>
<P>
Goulding's original mission to Lebanon was to determine the fate of Higgins, 
who was serving with a U.N. observer force there when he was kidnaped in 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Iranian government said it had refused to receive a note sent earlier 
in the week from Washington authorities, according to the official Iranian news 
agency. The report did not disclose the contents of the note, other than saying 
that it was related to events in Lebanon, but it claimed the message concerned 
matters "that had nothing to do with Iran." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Father Khalil Abi Nader, a Maronite Christian priest dispatched by Pope 
John Paul II, called on Hezbollah leader Fadlallah as part of a mission to 
investigate the reported execution of Higgins. Bush had asked the Pope for 
Vatican help in the hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for movement on the crisis were raised Friday when Rafsanjani declared 
Iran's willingness to help resolve the issues, combining the offer with a 
warning to Washington that its naval deployments in the region, which include 
the dispatch of the carrier America to the Arabian Sea off the Iranian coast, 
is aggravating the situation. Asked about Iran's role in resolving the crisis, 
a Nicosia-based ambassador of one of the countries directly involved told The 
Times: "I think he (Rafsanjani) is trying. I think he wants to be more flexible 
and more moderate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Algerians 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the focus turned to the Algerians, who were quietly but 
principally instrumental in the 1981 release of the 52 U.S. Embassy hostages 
held captive in Iran for 444 days. Ambassador Hasnawi, according to press 
reports published Saturday, told reporters Friday in Beirut that "the hostage 
issue has started to unfold." 
</P>
<P>
Hasnawi said his government has established a team of Algerian political 
officials and intelligence agents in the Lebanese capital "to contact the 
parties which hold the hostages . . . all the hostages, especially the 
Americans." He said that Bush had asked Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid to 
intercede. 
</P>
<P>
The claimed execution of Higgins and the death sentence against Cicippio, the 
kidnapers said, were both designed to force the Israeli government to free 
Obeid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Efforts' Cited 
</P>
<P>
Hasnawi said that he had met personally with Fadlallah and members of the 
organization's ruling council, and credited the sheik with "great efforts" to 
help forestall the execution of Cicippio. 
</P>
<P>
"Following contacts begun (Thursday) with Hezbollah, in the form of pleading 
and entreaties, and after we strongly condemned the abduction of Sheik Obeid, 
we counseled patience and self-restraint and called for absention from dramatic 
measures and decisions," the Algerian envoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Had Cicippio been killed, he told reporters, "It would have led to a dangerous 
reaction. America or Israel would have intervened militarily without anyone 
knowing the full scope or nature of such an intervention." The result, he said, 
would have been a "major explosion." 
</P>
<P>
The Arab diplomat claimed that frantic diplomatic activity had succeeded in 
"cooling off" the situation but warned that a binding solution would require a 
broader approach: "We should distance ourselves from bargaining tactics -- a 
hostage for a hostage, a hostage for sums of money. We should cure the causes 
for hostage taking: the Palestinian question, Israeli kidnapings, attacks 
against Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Pressure on Syria 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hostage crisis drew Syria into the diplomatic picture. It was 
not clear what role the Damascus government might have played in easing 
tensions, but the White House put heavy pressure on Syrian President Hafez 
Assad to help find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's editions of As Safir, a pro-Syrian Lebanese newspaper, suggested that 
the crisis may have a spillover effect on U.S.-Syrian relations concerning the 
long-running Lebanese civil war. Cicippio's reprieve, the newspaper reported, 
"has flung the doors wide open to an American-Syrian dialogue on Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday night and Saturday, the big guns opened up again in Beirut after 
four days of relative quiet. Seven hours of exchanges between Syrian and 
Christian artillerymen killed 21 and wounded more than 80, police reports said. 
Thirteen people were killed when a Syrian heavy mortar round landed on a 
shelter in the Christian sector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS IN CRISIS 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the new developments in the hostage situation: 
</P>
<P>
ALGERIAThis North African country is now a key player in trying to defuse the 
situation. Khaled Hasnawi, the ambassador to Lebanon, held a series of talks 
involving all the hostages. Official Algiers Radio said, "Progress in this 
mediation was accomplished." Hasnawi met with several people, including U.N. 
Undersecretary Marrack Goulding and Hezbollah's spiritual leader, Sheik 
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah. 
</P>
<P>
ISRAELRepeated its offer to swap prisoners with Shiite extremists after 
receiving a statement from Hezbollah demanding freedom for five Palestinians, 
in addition to Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and his two associates. 
</P>
<P>
IRANThe government said it refused to receive a note from the United States on 
"events in Lebanon." The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an 
unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying the message was delivered through a 
third country and "since the content had nothing to do with Iran, the message 
was not accepted." 
</P>
<P>
LEBANONPro-Iranian Muslims paraded in the Shiite slums of south Beirut to 
denounce the United States. At weekly prayers before the demonstration, 
Hezbollah spiritual leader Fadlallah urged those holding the hostages not to 
harm them. "Let's be better than they," he said, referring to the West. "Let's 
be loftier. Let's be more humanitarian." 
</P>
<P>
UNITED NATIONSUndersecretary Goulding, after meeting with Fadlallah and 
Algerian officials, arrived in Damascus, Syria, which holds military sway over 
two-thirds of Lebanon with an army estimated at 40,000 troops. "I came here to 
explore what the United Nations might be able to do to help promote a final 
solution to the hostage crisis," he told reporters. He planned to meet with 
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, among others.

AMNESTY LAW POSES DIFFICULT DECISION FOR IMMIGRANTS;

<P>
WHAT DO THEY DO WITH FAMILY LEFT BEHIND?

<P>
Legal U.S. residence status was no longer a problem for Benito Ortega, a 
longtime undocumented field hand here who received legal residence last year 
via the farm worker amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
But Ortega, like so many other newly legalized immigrants, was left with the 
dilemma of what to do with his wife and six children in Mexico. The amnesty law 
made no automatic provision to allow undocumented kin into the United States. 
Because the law fails to address the issue, it left amnesty migrants like 
Ortega with choices that were either unacceptable to him or to the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. He could take up residence in the United States, 
leaving his family behind for several years before there would any hope of 
their legal migration to join him. He could rejoin his family in Mexico and 
periodically travel hundreds of miles to and from jobs in the United States. Or 
he could keep the job he had, stay where he was and smuggle his family across 
the border to join him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Smuggler 
</P>
<P>
For Ortega (not his real name), the choice was obvious. He acknowledged paying 
a smuggler $1,000 to bring his family across from Tijuana four months ago. If 
caught and convicted of smuggling, he could face deportation and loss of legal 
status. But he says the risk is worth it and the money paid to the coyote was 
the best investment he ever made. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade as a "commuting" undocumented laborer -- working in U.S. 
fields during harvests, back home to Mexico for holidays -- convinced him that 
that was no way to live. "One loses touch with one's family," said Ortega 
during a recent gathering at an uncle's home in Oceanside. At his side were his 
wife, Rita, and their six children, ages 3 to 11. "How do I know if one of the 
children is headed in the wrong direction? My family needs to be here with me." 
</P>
<P>
Employed as a cook in nearby Vista, Ortega says he hopes to remain permanently 
in the United States. He envisions his children learning English and entering 
mainstream U.S. society. 
</P>
<P>
Though there are no exact numbers, it is clear that many newly legalized 
foreigners, particularly those from Mexico, are doing as Ortega did and simply 
bringing their families into the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, some argue, the landmark 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which 
created the amnesty program and was aimed at deterring unauthorized entry into 
the United States, may actually encourage the illegal immigration of some, 
namely the relatives of amnesty beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "family fairness" issue -- one of the most wrenching of the 
entire immigration debate -- has been present ever since lawmakers began 
discussing amnesty. And the matter is likely to linger for years, whatever the 
outcome of pending legislation in Congress aimed at resolving the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Though new immigrants have historically sought to bring their families to their 
adopted homes, the desire appears to have become stronger for many in the 
amnesty program. Migrants such as Ortega say their new-found legal status and 
sense of security prompted them to bring their families now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (amnesty) may have kind of accelerated what has naturally happened to 
people over time," said Anne Kamsvaag, an attorney with the Coalition for 
Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. "You have this big new batch of people 
with legal status, and they're sinking in roots now, whereas in the past they 
may have waited and maybe brought over one family member at a time." 
</P>
<P>
But the immigration tableau varies. Most amnesty recipients appear to be 
waiting before making any decisions about their families. 
</P>
<P>
"To bring my family here now would be too great a responsibility," said 
Guadalupe Ramirez Robles, a 40-year-old father of five and an amnesty recipient 
from the Mexican state of Oaxaca, who now lives in a crude shack above a 
Carlsbad flower-packing shed where he has found work. "I would have to rent an 
apartment, pay for their food here. And what if I lost my job? Who would 
provide for them?" 
</P>
<P>
Families split by amnesty may face an exasperating wait if they seek legal 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
For some nationalities, notably Mexicans, it can take a decade or more for 
legal residents' next of kin to immigrate through the existing preference 
system. The waiting lists are bulging and are expected to expand as more 
amnesty recipients petition to bring in their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, foreign nationals can apply for U.S. citizenship, a process that 
takes at least five years after gaining legal residence, and then petition for 
their families, waiting up to another year for processing. But some would 
rather retain their foreign citizenship, while others may not be able to pass 
the civics and English requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The legal process is somewhat quicker for Central Americans, the next-largest 
group of amnesty applicants after Mexicans, who are seeking to bring their 
families north; immigration waiting lists are generally backed up only about 
two years for the next of kin of those Central Americans who gain legal U.S. 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Long before Congress approved the amnesty laws, there was the question of what 
to do with the still-undocumented spouses and children of those who would 
become legal through amnesty. The eventual legalization program left the 
question open, providing no automatic "derivative benefit" for those facing 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
In response, however, the Immigration and Naturalization Service pledged not to 
deport or remove spouses and children of newly legalized migrants if severe 
hardship could be demonstrated. The INS says it has strictly adhered to the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say many family members are being detained and removed from the 
United States in apparent contradiction of that policy. In May, a controversy 
erupted in San Francisco when the INS returned a 15-year-old boy to Mexico even 
though his father had obtained amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
A much-publicized, recently passed amendment in the Senate sponsored by Sen. 
John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) would prohibit the deportation of spouses and children 
of amnesty recipients who were in the United States as of Nov. 6, 1986, the 
date the immigration reform statute was signed into law. That amendment, part 
of a wide-ranging and controversial overhaul of the immigration law, faces an 
uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
But even if it became law, the provision would do nothing for the many 
undocumented relatives still outside the United States or for those who have 
arrived since November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, undocumented immigrants arrested along the U. S.-Mexican border -- 
more than 1,000 daily in the San Diego area, the largest single clandestine 
crossing region -- are routinely sent back to their home countries, usually 
Mexico, or put in deportation proceedings, regardless of whether they have 
close relatives with amnesty. Some advocates contend that all children and 
spouses of amnesty recipients should be allowed to immigrate to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to make a lot more sense just to let these people come in legally and 
work," said Emily Goldfarb, director of the San Francisco-based Coalition for 
Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Services. "Most are going to come anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But INS and other officials disagree, saying that such a policy would overwhelm 
the immigration process and trigger pandemonium at the border. 
</P>
<P>
"We granted amnesty to individuals, not to families," said Duke Austin, an INS 
spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
That attitude, according to some, ignores human nature and a longtime, basic 
tenet of immigration law: family unification. 
</P>
<P>
"Huge backlogs for family members seeking to be reunited are just going to 
undermine the law and, frankly, encourage illegal immigration," said Cecilia 
Munoz, senior immigration policy analyst with the National Council of La Raza, 
a Washington-based Latino lobbying group. "The magnet between families has 
proved to be stronger than any laws we can create." 
</P>
<P>
This is certainly true in the case of Francisco, 35, and his wife, Lidia, 33, 
who have three children in the Mexican state of Morelos. He is legal, via 
amnesty, but his family remains without U.S. papers. Recently, he helped 
smuggle his wife in from Tijuana, and she is now staying with him in a 
makeshift migrant squatter's camp in rural San Diego; the children remain home 
in care of relatives. Lidia has found some work cleaning houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my (children) to be with me, but it's too difficult if they're 
illegal," Francisco said during a tranquil sunset recently at the encampment, 
as other men also from his home town nodded their approval. "There's nothing 
for them now in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The pull of family togetherness led the Ortegas in Oceanside to breach the law 
to reunite everyone, children included, despite the expense, the risks and 
fear. Rita Ortega still cringes when she remembers the early-morning darkness 
of last March 28, when she says she and her six children crossed into the 
United States from Tijuana, eventually to be reunited with her husband in 
northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Before the crossing, Benito Ortega had brought the family's suitcases over the 
border, entering legally through the port of entry at San Ysidro with his 
amnesty card. That evening, a smuggler waited for the family on the U. S. side 
and drove them north without incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The children (that) were crying in my arms that night," Rita Ortega recalled, 
are now enrolled in San Diego schools. 
</P>
<P>
As an undocumented person, she has natural fear of la migra, she said, but 
added that she seldom leaves the couple's two-bedroom apartment. She would like 
to work, perhaps cleaning homes, she says, but she fears venturing out. At any 
rate, she is relieved to be part of a cohesive, united family, finally facing 
the future as one. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband says it's not easy to make ends meet for the entire family on his 
$500 weekly restaurant salary, and he too wishes that his wife could leave the 
house and work. And he acknowledges some nostalgia for the freedom of his 
adventurous former life, 13 years of wandering through the immigrant job 
markets of the West. But he wants his family together. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he said, "now we have roots here. We plan to stay."

CALTRANS HOPES MECHANICAL FREEWAY WORKERS WILL REDUCE FATALITIES AMONG ITS ROAD 
CREWS

<TEXT>
<P>
More Caltrans road maintenance workers have been killed on the state's highways 
in recent years than members of the California Highway Patrol. So robots are 
being developed to replace the endangered workers -- and also make it possible 
to do more work at night, keeping freeway lanes open during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, 45 orange-clad California Department of Transportation workers have 
been killed and hundreds more injured by what the agency refers to as "errant 
motorists" -- drunken drivers barreling down the freeway at 75 m.p.h. or truck 
drivers, occasionally high on drugs, who cannot stop their rigs before they 
smash into a repair crew. 
</P>
<P>
In that same time period, 42 CHP members have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous out there," said Bob Ramey, deputy director for construction 
and maintenance in District 7, covering Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
To try to reduce this carnage, Caltrans has embarked on a research program to 
develop robotic machines that not only will take maintenance workers off the 
roads but also allow repairs to be done in less time, thereby helping with the 
congestion problems that are becoming increasingly critical in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Davis campus has a three-year, $1.2-million Caltrans contract to develop 
automatic devices that will seal freeway cracks, paint road stripes, replace 
pavement markers and pick up litter. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, there may also be machines to patch potholes and repair crash 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to automate the entire maintenance operation," said Andrew A. Frank, 
professor of mechanical engineering at UC Davis and head of the "maintenance 
robotics" program. "We want to get workers off the road because the work is 
dangerous and we want to speed up the process. We think most of these jobs can 
be done five to 10 times faster than they are now." 
</P>
<P>
The first project undertaken by Frank and his group of half a dozen faculty 
members and 20 or so graduate and undergraduate students is a robotic device to 
replace pavement markers. 
</P>
<P>
These markers, some reflecting and others non-reflecting "rumble markers," are 
placed every 48 feet on freeways and highways. On little-used roads, they can 
last for years, but on a heavily traveled road such as the Long Beach Freeway, 
they can wear out in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The present method involves a two-man crew, with one driving the vehicle and 
the other wedged into a small compartment at tire level. While the vehicle 
rumbles along, the Caltrans worker in the lower compartment squirts epoxy on 
the markers and smacks them down on the lane. If all goes well, the team can 
replace about 200 markers in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In the system under development at UC Davis, glue is squirted onto the roadway 
by a worker riding in a bucket seat, then markers automatically slide down a 
chute and are tamped into place. This machine, which Caltrans expects to have 
in service within a year, can replace 600 to 800 markers an hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Involvement 
</P>
<P>
UC Davis researchers will do much of the work on the marker replacement device 
but Frank expects other universities and especially private industry to develop 
some of the other machines, under general supervision of the Davis campus. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that not much can be done with the $1.2 million the state is 
providing and that "cost sharing by private industry will be necessary" if 
these projects are to come to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
"We will monitor the projects," Frank said, "but our objective is to stimulate 
industry because they're the ones who are going to benefit -- they can sell 
these things to the entire world." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other automatic devices that Frank and his Davis colleagues hope to 
develop are: 
</P>
<P>
* A device that can clear large debris from the roadway while moving at speeds 
of up to 30 m.p.h. Currently, lanes are closed while workers on foot clear dead 
animals, wayward tires, garbage cans and homicide victims from the freeways and 
the bushes alongside. 
</P>
<P>
"We do run across dead bodies or parts of bodies," Ramey said. "I suppose 
that's the most disagreeable part of clean-up work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Handy Escape Routes' 
</P>
<P>
Ramey explained that local police and the CHP take care of accident victims but 
"I'm talking about homicides -- people get killed and dumped along the freeway, 
you know. Freeways are handy escape routes for criminals. . . . Mostly, they 
knock 'em off and roll 'em down the bank and we find 'em in the brush." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans already has an automated "litter gitter," with 6-foot robotic arms, 
that can pick up medium-sized debris, but it is slow. The new contraption will 
be faster and will be able to pick up larger objects. 
</P>
<P>
* A machine that will seal freeway and roadway cracks, a job now done by a 
Caltrans worker walking along with a kettle filled with crack sealer. In the 
new device, electronic sensors detect cracks; then valves open automatically to 
seal them. Caltrans officials expect to have such a machine in service in about 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
* A device that will detect faded road markings and automatically repaint them. 
Presently, Caltrans employs a dozen paint stripers statewide but hopes to 
replace them with machines in about three years. 
</P>
<P>
Frank also hopes that pothole filling, crash barrier repair and other 
maintenance jobs eventually can be transferred from men to machines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much Pizazz 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he added, "the maintenance area is something that's been 
completely ignored by researchers, I guess because it doesn't have very much 
pizazz." 
</P>
<P>
But the growing problem of traffic congestion, combined with the rapid 
development of electronic sensors and small computers that can be placed aboard 
vehicles, make this kind of research more attractive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Caltrans is to succeed in its goal of doubling road capacity and reducing 
accidents by 50% in the next few years, better and faster maintenance will play 
a crucial role. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to increase capacity, we're going to have less time for 
maintenance," said Robert E. Parsons, director of the UC Program on Advanced 
Technology on the Highway (PATH). "That means we've got to have a maintenance 
program to get workers off the road and do things faster."

ORANGE COUNTY GAYS ASSUME HIGH POLITICAL PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the podium of a Disneyland Hotel ballroom stood Thomas F. Riley, retired 
Marine Corps general and chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, 
lauding the contributions of two members of the community. The subject of his 
praise: a gay couple who had worked to combat AIDS and discrimination against 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mickey Mouse was there, roaming the black-tie audience of 700 and posing 
for pictures with homosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
For Don Hagan, one of the honorees, that April evening was hugely significant 
in demonstrating the gains that he and others in the gay community have made in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a symbol of the change in attitudes, in acceptance, here in Orange 
County. That was something you would never have seen here even three or four 
years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gay movement in politically conservative Orange County -- slower in 
developing than in other urban centers throughout the state -- is seeking, with 
unprecedented visibility, to flex its political muscle. But even as gay leaders 
seek to make their presence felt, they have been met by a ferocious attack from 
opponents, especially the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
"The homosexuals are going for broke these days, clearly," declared the Rev. 
Louis Sheldon, head of the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim and a fierce 
anti-gay activist. "The battle is now, and the community as a whole is going to 
have to decide if it's going to accept this repugnant behavior as somehow 
normal. I don't think they will." 
</P>
<P>
At no time in the development of the gay political movement in Orange County 
has this political clash been seen more vividly than in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
*In Santa Ana, a group dominated by those of the religious right is seeking to 
halt plans for a Gay Pride Festival that organizers bill as the largest 
cultural celebration of the homosexual community ever held in the county. As 
opponents of the festival pressed City Council members to revoke the event's 
permit, several hundred gay-rights activists met them head on last month 
outside City Hall with chants of "Two, four, six, eight -- Orange County ain't 
so straight!" 
</P>
<P>
*In Irvine, a group of residents is trying to persuade voters to approve a 
November ballot initiative that would delete the words "sexual orientation" 
from the city's human rights ordinance, thereby removing homosexuals from the 
protection other minorities have against discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
*In Corona del Mar, a high school psychology teacher earlier this year was 
ordered to stop his 19-year practice of inviting homosexuals to speak to his 
class after opposition mounted from at least 70 parents. 
</P>
<P>
*And in the most far-reaching clash to date on the sensitive issue, the county 
Board of Supervisors in June rejected a measure that would have outlawed 
discrimination against AIDS victims in housing, employment and public services. 
The measure was pitched by some supporters as largely symbolic, but the three 
supervisors who opposed it maintained that it needlessly duplicated existing 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who supported the measure along with Riley, 
lamented later that the vote would only solidify Orange County's image as a 
"recalcitrant" community that has not yet achieved an urban outlook. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' rejection of the AIDS anti-discrimination plan, some in the 
homosexual community say, exposed the weakness of the county's gay movement. 
But, the leaders say, the defeat has galvanized them for an even stronger 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Got Overconfident' 
</P>
<P>
"We got overconfident," said Jeff Le Tourneau, co-founder of the Orange County 
Visibility League, a gay activist group formed in 1987. "It was a failure on 
our part to realize that logic and reason aren't enough. We failed to 
anticipate the arm-twisting and political intimidation of the religious right 
and respond to it. And that was the blow that awakened the sleeping giant. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to put the Rev. Sheldon and his people on notice that we are at war 
here in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County struggle has been watched and in some cases joined by gay 
activists in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very exciting time of progress in Orange County, and we here are 
just delighted with it," said Morris Kight, a longtime leader in Los Angeles' 
gay community. Kight said he is issuing an "emergency call to action" asking 
Los Angeles-area gays to support their brothers and sisters to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Added Mark Kostopoulos, a spokesman for ACT UP/LA, a gay rights group known for 
its aggressive tactics: "Obviously, the (gay and lesbian) people of Orange 
County are not satisfied with being invisible and are finding a new 
assertiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kight acknowledged that, even with such progress, Orange County gay leaders 
face greater obstacles -- largely in the form of such strident anti-gay leaders 
as Sheldon and Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) -- than those faced in Los Angeles. "They're going to have a 
fight on their hands," Kight said of Orange County gays. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Los Angeles community have shown a willingness to help in that 
fight. At a recent rally at Santa Ana City Hall in support of the Gay Pride 
Festival, for instance, about two dozen members of Los Angeles' gay community 
-- most from ACT UP/LA -- drove down to show their support, according to 
Kostopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, however, sought to turn this support to his advantage by maintaining 
that the bulk of the more than 400 gay-rights supporters had to be "bused in" 
from Los Angeles -- evidence, he claimed, that grass-roots support in Orange 
County was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights organizations also claim to be growing in numbers. Their leaders say 
there are about 700 "activists" who will come to protests and other public 
events in the county, but that the potential for future growth is enormous. 
Although the number of homosexuals in Orange County is not known, gay community 
leaders estimate there are several hundred thousand. Sheldon and other anti-gay 
forces say the figure is much lower. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter on the Gay Pride Festival issue, Dannemeyer urged Santa Ana 
Mayor Daniel H. Young to "take a stand and affirm the heterosexual ethic as the 
foundation of our society. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Please do not allow the homosexual community to bully you into advocating 
their perverse life style." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, the county's only openly gay elected 
official, says that conservative leaders such as Dannemeyer and Sheldon are 
"out of step with the people of Orange County" as reflected by public opinion 
yardsticks. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 survey conducted by a UC Irvine pollster, 67% of county residents 
said that "homosexual relations between consenting adults in the privacy of 
their home" should be legal, while 27% said they should be illegal. Nationwide, 
a Los Angeles Times Poll that same year found that 53% of the people surveyed 
said such relations should be legal, while 35% said they should be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"The old stereotype of traditional, intransigent Orange County doesn't hold up 
on the gay rights issue," Gentry said. "We may not have won yet, but the very 
fact that these issues are being discussed so heatedly and so frequently now is 
a huge step."

YAMALES, Honduras 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Morales Castro's last decision as a free man came in April, 1988, when he 
deserted a Sandinista army training base and began the 100-mile trek toward his 
mother's tiny farm in southern Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later he was seized by a rebel patrol and forced to march barefoot 
in the opposite direction, embarking on an ordeal that has not yet ended. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 23-year-old Morales, a dark, tranquil-looking peasant who has never 
seen combat, is counted by the Contras as one of the 11,000 rebels in their 
sprawling network of camps here at the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. 
</P>
<P>
But according to human rights officials and Contra deserters, he is one of 
many, perhaps hundreds, of young men and women being forced to remain with an 
army that is running out of reasons to fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contras' Future on the Line 
</P>
<P>
The future of the U.S.-backed insurgency was on the line this weekend as the 
presidents of five Central American countries gathered in Tela, a town on 
Honduras' Caribbean coast, to negotiate the conditions and timetable for 
disarming the rebels under a peace plan that also calls for free elections in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Contra commanders oppose any move to dismantle their army before the voting 
next Feb. 25, arguing that only a large belligerent force can hold the 
Sandinista government accountable for any fraud. They have stepped up 
recruiting inside Nicaragua and tightened security in the camps to keep their 
army, mostly idled during 16 months of truces, intact. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews here last week, dozens of young Nicaraguans who have spent their 
youth on the seven-year war echoed their commanders' resolve to resume the 
struggle if the Sandinista revolutionary government is reelected -- even if a 
summit accord costs them their Honduran bases and U.S. funds. 
</P>
<P>
But the commanders' rigid control of the camps conceals a dissident view. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a prisoner here," Morales told a reporter in a tense interview that, like 
the others, had to be conducted in the presence of an officer schooled in 
psychological operations. 
</P>
<P>
When the officer interrupted to warn him to "watch what you say," the young man 
hesitated. Then he declared: "I cannot hide the truth. Here I have no free 
will. I am tired of pretending to be a Contra." 
</P>
<P>
The young man's plight came to the reporter's attention at the headquarters of 
the rebels' Human Rights Assn. in the camp network. He has hidden out there for 
five weeks since leaving his own assigned tent with the Jorge Salazar IV 
battalion. 
</P>
<P>
Morales was held formally as one of about 100 prisoners of war from April to 
December last year, when the Honduran government ordered Contra jails closed. 
Then he asked to be sent to a U.N.-supervised refugee camp but was assigned 
instead to the Salazar battalion and given a nom de guerre, El Jefe. 
</P>
<P>
In a second interview, with no one else present, Morales said he wants to go 
home to his mother, who lives alone and apparently knows nothing of his 
whereabouts. His superiors have told him he would be persecuted in Nicaragua as 
a deserter, but he said he is willing to take that risk. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer with the rights agency, Rodolfo Sandino, said he asked the rebels' 
general staff more than a week ago to discharge Morales, but staff officers 
said they had no record of the request. 
</P>
<P>
"Help me get out of here," the unwilling soldier, wearing U.S. army camouflage 
pants and a striped sport shirt, whispered as the reporter left him in the 
doorway of his plastic-covered shack. "The pressure to put me back in the 
battalion is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
How many others want to quit the guerrilla army is hard to judge, but the 
number seems considerable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Estimates 1,800 Escaped 
</P>
<P>
Sandino estimates that 1,800 rebels have escaped from the camps in each of the 
past two years, only to be replaced by at least that many new fighters, some of 
them forcibly recruited. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras' U.S. advisers have tried to discourage conscription by kidnaping. 
But the politically damaging practice has continued along with the Sandinistas' 
harshly applied draft law, which requires two years of military service by all 
young males. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials assert that more than 3,000 Nicaraguans are in rebel 
captivity, but that estimate is probably high. Many peasant farmers whose sons 
willingly join the Contras feel that they must report them as having been 
"abducted" or face reprisals by the police. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Sandino estimates that no more than 15% of the rebels are "very 
clear" about their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest are happy with the clothing and food they get in the camps" at U.S. 
expense. If the war resumes, he added, "I don't know what kind of fighters they 
would be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Face Limited Choices 
</P>
<P>
Foot soldiers wanting to quit the Contras now have limited options: return to 
Nicaragua, live in a crowded refugee camp in Honduras or sneak into a third 
country as an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
But if disarmed rebels were to be admitted to third countries, as many as 3,000 
would leave Yamales, estimates Marta Patricia Baltodano, the rights agency's 
Miami-based director. 
</P>
<P>
That assertion was angrily disputed by Commander Jackson, a psychological 
operations officer who insists that guerrilla service is voluntary. "Nobody 
wants to leave," he said. "Well, maybe five or six or seven, but that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Contra commanders are extremely sensitive to suggestions that theirs is an army 
of captives. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, after the Contra rights agency was set up with U.S. 
congressional support, it quietly located four missing Nicaraguans who 
confirmed that they had been abducted by the rebels. The high command 
retaliated by punishing several officers involved in the search. 
</P>
<P>
In response to growing complaints by the Sandinistas about rebel captives, the 
commanders have recently accepted systematic searches by the agency's 
seven-member staff as well as spot searches by the International Red Cross and 
a pair of American doctors. 
</P>
<P>
One turning point was a stormy meeting earlier this year between the rights 
agency and the Contra general staff. 
</P>
<P>
Baltodano said she was warned that her efforts were "creating a crisis" that 
could undermine the Contras' fighting strength. "We said, 'You're the ones 
creating the crisis by holding people who don't want to be here,' " Sandino 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the agency's searches since then, about 300 people on a 
Sandinista government list of missing have been located in Yamales, and 150 
have been interviewed. Seventeen who expressed a desire to leave have been 
given discharges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Interviewed 4 
</P>
<P>
But high-level cooperation is not so easy for outsiders. Tim Takaro and Susan 
Cookson, the American doctors, were allowed to visit Yamales last March 1 and 
interview four of the 10 people on a list of alleged kidnap victims from the 
rural war zone where the couple had worked in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
After three of the four declared they wanted to return to Nicaragua, the 
commanders persuaded them overnight to recant. The doctors' visit abruptly 
ended the next day as rebel leaders accused them of spying for the Sandinistas 
and working to undermine morale in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
In a report on their mission, Takaro and Cookson concluded: "It is impossible 
for an individual in these camps to make a free decision. Three of the four 
(we) examined showed signs of severe stress. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been isolated in a militarized camp with limited freedom of movement 
and no outside sources of information," the doctors wrote. "The camp itself 
seems more like a reclusive religious colony. The cult leaders are fanatical 
believers. . . . They find it incredible that anyone in their ranks could doubt 
the rightness of their cause." 
</P>
<P>
Acting on the report, Baltodano visited the camp two weeks later and located 
seven of those on the list. Four told her they wanted to go home, and she 
arranged discharges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Cited Rebel Pressure 
</P>
<P>
In interviews in Nicaragua, all four said they had been subjected to 
psychological pressure by rebel leaders during the doctors' visit. 
</P>
<P>
"They took me to the headquarters to talk to Pepe (a rebel officer)," said 
Diego Centeno, 17, a rural health worker. "He said I was making a mistake to go 
back to the Sandinistas. If I said I was kidnaped, (Congress) would take away 
the aid and leave (the rebels) starving." 
</P>
<P>
To a reporter who visited Yamales last week for the first time in seven months, 
the camps seemed more regimented. Contra leaders are now more insistent on 
escorting visitors on interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Foot soldiers can and do listen to radio broadcasts from Nicaragua, but mostly 
they hear political lectures from their own superiors on the impossibility of 
free elections there and the persecution they would face as repatriates. A July 
2 policy statement by the general staff, outlining the procedure for seeking a 
discharge, was nowhere to be seen. Sandino said it was supposed to be posted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Girlfriend Chose to Stay 
</P>
<P>
During the reporter's interview with the Centeno boy's 16-year-old girlfriend, 
who was force-marched to the Contra camp with him but chose to stay, a rebel 
officer stood by and coached her. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she did not want to return to Nicaragua, the girl, Maria de los 
Angeles Gonzalez, fidgeted with a key ring and stared at her combat boots. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him you are not in agreement with the regime," said the officer, who 
calls himself Josue. 
</P>
<P>
Maria just nodded. 
</P>
<P>
Later, away from the officer, the teen-ager insisted she was content in the 
camps, where she flattens corn tortillas for hungry troops. The real reason, it 
appears, is a new boyfriend, a Contra who calls himself Hawaii and shares her 
tent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Officer Intervenes 
</P>
<P>
Apparently displeased by the reporter's interest in such cases, Contra 
officials tried to cut short his visit, until Luis Adan Fley, the rebels' 
amiable legal officer, intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Fley, a former rebel field commander, said the Contras are quietly debating the 
question of who will stay in the ranks. He believes a guerrilla force half the 
current size would be more manageable if it lost its base here and had to 
operate entirely inside Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
But Anroyce Zelaya, the only general staff member in camp last week, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The more men we have in Nicaragua, the better we can run the Sandinistas all 
over the map," said the officer, who is known as Commander Douglas. "I am sure 
80% of our men would fight. Most of them have been here more than a year 
without fighting. Anyone who wanted to could have left by now."

ISRAEL REPEATS OFFER TO SWAP PRISONERS AFTER DEMAND BY HEZBOLLAH THAT IT FREE 5 
ARABS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Israeli government on Saturday repeated its offer to swap prisoners with 
Shiite Muslim extremists in Lebanon and cautiously studied a statement by the 
pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement demanding freedom for five Palestinians 
imprisoned by Israel for fatal attacks against Israeli civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Among the prisoners named by Hezbollah was a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip 
who deliberately steered a bus off a highway near Jerusalem last month. Sixteen 
passengers, including two Canadians and an American, were killed in the fiery 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The statement of Hezbollah (Party of God) came in the wake of hints publicized 
last week that it would hand the Red Cross a list of the names of prisoners 
whom it wants Israel to free. No such list has been given to Israel; the names 
announced Saturday were given to news agencies in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
As a precondition for any move, Hezbollah demanded the release of a Shiite 
clergyman, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, and two of his relatives seized July 28 by 
Israeli commandos in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose ministry deals with hostage matters here, 
announced Saturday night that "Israel's offer is valid." The offer, made last 
week, included a willingness to exchange Obeid and other Shiites held by Israel 
for three Israeli soldiers, now in Hezbollah hands, as well as 14 Western 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are not taking into consideration public announcements," Rabin said. 
"If and when Hezbollah contacts the Red Cross and the Red Cross contacts us, we 
will discuss it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Eitan Haber, a spokesman for Rabin, said: "This is a war of nerves." 
</P>
<P>
Israel would consider a Hezbollah contact with the International Committee of 
the Red Cross to be an indication that the group would be willing to make a 
deal, a Foreign Ministry official added. 
</P>
<P>
Should Hezbollah respond concretely, the possible release of some of the 
prisoners it listed would be hard for the Israeli public to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
One, Abdel Hadi Suleiman Ghanem, a Palestinian refugee, grabbed the steering 
wheel of passenger bus No. 405 on July 7 and sent it crashing off the Tel 
Aviv-Jerusalem highway. 
</P>
<P>
Another, Nidal Zaloum, a college student from Ramallah, slashed bystanders on 
Jaffa Road in Jerusalem in early May, killing two people waiting at a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaffa Road knifings and the bus tragedy set off outpourings of rage among 
Israeli citizens. There would probably be a public uproar at the release of the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Ital Alyan, another mentioned prisoner, last year tried to kill Maj. Gen. 
Antoine Lahad, commander of the South Lebanon Army, a Christian-led militia 
allied with Israel in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against the other two Palestinians on the Hezbollah list, Anwar 
Yassin and Shoha Bishara, are not known publicly here. Hezbollah called them 
"heroes of the Lebanese resistance," indicating that they had fought Israel 
along its border with Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the possibility of domestic controversy, Israeli officials were not 
ruling out a swap that would include these prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see. It would be difficult, but if it's an offer, we would have 
to look at it. We have set murderers free before to get back our people," a 
Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a United Jewish Appeal meeting last week, Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir spelled out Israel's position. "We do not forsake the soldier in the 
battlefield, nor do we relent in our efforts to obtain the release of a soldier 
or civilian who may be abducted under any circumstances by enemies or 
terrorists," he said.

3 RIVALS FOR JAPANESE PREMIERSHIP ASSESS U.S. FRICTIONS 
</P>

<P>
The three men hoping to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Sosuke Uno offered 
three different solutions Saturday to Japan's economic frictions with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
They ranged from better explanations to Washington of actions Japan already is 
taking to a get-tough-with-America approach. 
</P>
<P>
The likely winner, former Education Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 58, suggested 
better explanations. He said that the United States has failed to understand 
the improvements Japan is achieving. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming part of American criticism of Japan on what he called "emotional" 
arguments, Kaifu said that Japan's surplus in its trade with the United States 
is gradually declining as a result of increasing domestic demand in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We should fully explain to the United States the efforts we are making to 
restructure our economy," he told a nationally televised news conference that 
brought him together with his two opponents for the post of president of the 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
The new leader, to be elected in a caucus Tuesday, is expected to be chosen 
prime minister Wednesday by the lower house of Parliament, in which the Liberal 
Democrats hold a 38-seat majority. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu and his two opponents completed procedures Saturday to run in the party 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Selection of the new leader is regarded as crucial to the ability of the 
perennial ruling party to retain control of the government in the wake of its 
first-ever defeat in an upper house election July 23. An election for the lower 
house, which elects the prime minister, must be held by next July. 
</P>
<P>
Former Welfare Minister Yoshiro Hayashi, 62, said that a "free trade 
agreement," as proposed by former U.S. envoy Mike Mansfield, is "one 
possibility" to ease frictions with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the final form, "a new overall approach to carry out discussions 
encompassing not only trade but also exchange rates, finance issues and other 
problems is necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The get-tough-with-America approach was proposed by Shintaro Ishihara, 56, a 
hawkish novelist turned politician who is likely to be an also-ran in the 
caucus election. 
</P>
<P>
Ishihara singled out Makoto Kuroda, a former deputy vice minister for 
international affairs of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, as 
the ideal kind of "tough and cool" negotiator Japan should have to deal with 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Because he clearly said 'no' (to America). With him, for the first time, 
normal negotiations of equality became possible with the United States," 
Ishihara said. 
</P>
<P>
He called for Japan to emulate the European Community by standing up to U.S. 
demands for an opening of Japan's agricultural markets. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no argument so simplistic as to put all of the blame upon Japan for 
the accumulation of black ink in Japan's trade. For instance, bad (American) 
manufacturing supervision, the lack of marketing ideas and poor quality goods 
(also are to blame)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ishihara also said that the Japanese government should have independently 
developed its new fighter jet, dubbed the FSX, instead of accepting an American 
proposal for joint development that has been criticized by the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The FSX Japan wanted to make would have been an epochal, defensive fighter 
plane, but this was changed (to joint development). . . . Why does Japan have 
to swallow this kind of thing? If we had developed the plane by ourselves, we 
would have been able to have established real deterrent power. . . . But, in 
the end, we bowed to what America said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this diplomacy? Nobody could evaluate this (the FSX negotiations) as a 
diplomatic negotiation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the candidates, however, rejected any opening of Japan's rice 
market to imports. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, Hayashi said, "is a religious issue in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't change Japanese Buddhism. . . . It would be the same thing as asking 
the United States to change its Christianity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues -- and what they agreed is a "crisis" facing the ruling 
party -- the three candidates voiced few differences. All three promised 
revisions in an unpopular 3% consumption tax that was put into effect April 1.

BLOCH, IN NEW INTERVIEW, DEFLECTS SPYING QUESTIONS 
</P>

<P>
American diplomat Felix S. Bloch, in his first interview since becoming the 
subject of a major U.S. espionage investigation, told an Austrian magazine that 
the case against him amounts only to "suspicions," the publication reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, according to the report in the authoritative Profil magazine, deflected 
questions on whether he is guilty of passing sensitive information to the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Urged by the interviewer to declare that he was "not a spy," Bloch instead said 
only: "There are suspicions, but there is no proof. They have to prove my 
guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he might have more to say about the matter, Bloch said: "I have to 
wait to see how things develop." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who served for four years as the No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy in 
Vienna, had refused all public comment since the State Department confirmed 
last month that he is suspected of spying for the Soviets since the mid-1970s. 
He talked briefly with U.S. investigators when they first confronted him with 
the allegations but since then has refused to cooperate with the probe, U.S. 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
In the magazine interview, Bloch acknowledged that he had "heard the name" 
Reino Gikman, the alias U.S. investigators say was used by the Soviet agent who 
may have served as Bloch's contact with the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
But he would not say whether he had ever met him, saying that "nobody has told 
me who Gikman is, so I can't say if I have seen him or not." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. investigators, French intelligence agents observed Bloch pass 
a travel bag to Gikman at a rendezvous at a Paris restaurant in May. The 
contents of the bag are unknown. Later, in a telephone call monitored through 
electronic eavesdropping, Gikman allegedly warned Bloch that they had come 
under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
In its new report on the Bloch case, Profil said that three years ago, Austrian 
counterespionage officers shadowed Gikman, a suspected Soviet agent then 
traveling on a forged Finnish passport, when he was seen meeting with a man. 
</P>
<P>
Gikman's companion was not identified at the time, the article said, but 
high-level Austrian officials now believe it was Bloch.

American, British and French soldiers stationed in West Berlin regularly go on 
buying sprees in East Berlin to purchase state-subsidized products with money 
obtained illegally on the black market, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers sell dollars and West German marks to speculators in West Berlin, 
who in return give them East German marks at an illegal rate as much as 20 
times more favorable than the official exchange level, the official government 
daily said. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers from the three countries that stay in West Berlin look at the 
capital of East Germany as a kind of modern Klondike," Izvestia said, referring 
to the Alaskan region that was the site of a gold rush in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in empty-handed and leave loaded with purchases," it said. "No one 
would pay any attention to them but for their military uniforms -- American, 
British and French. Everyone knows that they come from West Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
There are 6,200 American, 3,500 British and 2,700 French soldiers in West 
Berlin.

L.A. REINVENTS THE DELI; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK'S CARNEGIE MARCHES INTO TOWN IN WHAT IS BECOMING A BIG PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"I'm running out of product," said manager Steve Romick, standing at the door 
looking miserable as he turned people away. "We're going to have to close 
early." 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended the first night of the first day of the most hyped deli in history. 
They were low on food, low on drinks, low on energy. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had quite expected it to be like that. When the management opened the 
doors at 7 a.m. there were people waiting; at 7 p.m. there were still people 
waiting. By that time 2,000 people had walked through the door and the 
management had stopped counting heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I've opened a lot of restaurants," designer Pat Kuleto had said at the gala 
star-studded official opening a week earlier (the restaurant remained closed to 
the public), "but I've never seen anything like this. It's the Batman of 
Delis." 
</P>
<P>
The analogy is apt; the Carnegie opened 
</P>
<P>
as if it were a movie, not a restaurant. The opening party had lights, carpets, 
columnists (Army Archerd was there from Variety, officially "chatting" with the 
incoming celebrities -- of which there were dozens). The pre-opening hoopla was 
even more intense: Two years before the actual opening the columns were filled 
with items about the coming of New York's most famous deli to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It's no more than you'd expect when Hollywood's richest man decides that deli 
is his dish. And deli is definitely Marvin Davis' dish: he had a standing order 
at Century City's Stage Deli for half a pound of Nova Scotia salmon, 6 bagels, 
a pint of cream cheese and 4 bags of potato chips to be delivered to his office 
every morning at 7 a.m. The order was canceled the day that the Carnegie 
opened, for Davis had only been making do. His real love was New York's 
Carnegie, where he was known to spend a thousand dollars at one crack. Davis 
finally got tired of schlepping deli from New York and decided it was time for 
the deli to come to him. He struck a deal with the Carnegie, insisting that all 
he wanted was the best deli in the West. What he ended up with, however, was 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a new breed of restaurant," said Kuleto, "an upscale deli." The 
hiring of Kuleto is a case in point: he is one of the world's most famous 
restaurant designers. He's done dozens of restaurants (including Postrio and 
Fog City Diner in San Francisco), and is now designing restaurants in Paris, 
Tokyo and Washington, D.C. But here he is designing a deli. 
</P>
<P>
Delis, by their very nature, don't get designed. Delis are the people's 
restaurant, an all-American invention where the portions are big, the prices 
are fair and nobody cares what you're wearing. The late Leo Steiner, the man 
who made New York's Carnegie famous, thought that the deli had become the 
quintessential American restaurant. "It's not ethnic anymore," he said, "who 
doesn't know chopped liver?" 
</P>
<P>
Delis are supposed to be loud. Delis are supposed to be grubby. Delis are 
supposed to have stand-up comics sitting 
</P>
<P>
at a table in the corner and stand-up comics standing by your table, bringing 
you food and making your life miserable. Delis are supposed to leave you 
staggeringly full. But Delis are not supposed to have designers. 
</P>
<P>
Take New York's Carnegie. It is an unpretty places where you sit jowl to elbow 
with a neighboring stranger and wait for your plate to come and improve the 
view. Katz's on the Lower East Side has all the charm of an Army commissary, 
where you come in, take a ticket and listen to rude countermen bark if they 
don't think you're ordering with sufficient speed. Even their slogan -- "Send a 
salami to your boy in the Army" is military. While West Coast delis may have 
softer edges, even at their spiffiest they have all the charm of oversized 
coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
But the Beverly Hills Carnegie is different. "This," said Kuleto, "is supposed 
to be reminiscent of what all delis should have been." So Kuleto created a 
fantasy. He pointed around the front room, with its hanging Deco lights and 
wooden booths. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine that this front room was the original deli that was built in the 
'20s." 
</P>
<P>
It's easier to imagine that this was a set for a movie about a deli built in 
the '20s by somebody who had never been outside the State of California. "The 
second room was built after Prohibition in the '40s." This room, you 
understand, is the one with the bar. The bar? "And the last room was added 
later because the deli was so popular." Here you'll find cozy padded booths, 
which is enough to make any Deli maven immediately suspicious. Delis aren't 
supposed to be comfortable. "The idea," Kuleto concluded, "was to make the 
place feel real." 
</P>
<P>
As real as anything in Hollywood. This, after all, is a deli where the comics 
sit not at the tables but on the board of directors. George Burns is chairman 
of the board. Milton Berle, who admits that he is "not a big deli man," owns a 
piece of the action (2%). 
</P>
<P>
And where but Hollywood would you find a deli with a bar? A deli with valets 
waiting to whisk your car away? A 
</P>
<P>
deli whose rent is a reported $27,000 a month? A deli with waiters who look 
like they are trying out for parts as Rob Lowe's understudy? A deli that 
proudly offers pastrami on white with lettuce, tomato and mayo? A deli that 
lets you -- God forbid -- make your own egg creams at the table? And what's 
that on the table -- Dijon mustard? Leo Steiner would not have approved. There 
is much here, however, that Steiner would be proud of. The size of the 
portions, for example. It was Steiner who said, "We got so much here in this 
country. Why should we give a person a little bit of food? Are we a starving 
Third World nation?" 
</P>
<P>
Rest in peace, Leo. Each sandwich at the new Carnegie is a minor mountain and a 
monument to excess. The pastrami comes from New York (most of it from the 
Carnegie itself, with back up from Brooklyn Provisions). The cheesecake comes 
from the Carnegie (although not, regretably, the Ruglach cheesecake variation). 
The novi (deli parlance for smoked Nova Scotia salmon) and the sable are smooth 
and soft; the cole slaw is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
And why not, with Bobbie Trager in charge? Trager, who had been general manager 
of New York's Carnegie for seven years, grew up in delis. His grandfather owned 
New York's legendary Murray's Sturgeon Shop. He's come to California ("there 
are more New Yorkers here than in New York anyway") to manage the new Carnegie, 
and he probably knows as much about what a deli should be as anybody around. 
</P>
<P>
Trager defends the pastrami on white. "I called it the Mia Farrow because I 
remembered that's what she used to order when she came in. What can I say?" 
What Trager can say -- is that he finds some other California tastes very 
strange. "People here are very health conscious. I've never sold so many egg 
whites; Matzo brei with egg white really blew me away. And I hope there are 
enough turkeys in America for us to cook. This is different." 
</P>
<P>
This deli may be different -- but it is only the beginning. Malibu is about to 
have a new deli of its own. Like the Beverly Hills Carnegie, it is the 
brainchild of a rich man, Paul Zimmerman, who "just wanted to have good deli 
food in my own neighborhood." What's on the menu? According to the press 
release, the Malibu Deli in the Cross Creek Center will feature, in addition to 
your usual pastrami and egg creams, "a California-style gourmet deli menu." 
This will include "a large array of salads and light dishes recommended by the 
Heart Association and Pritikin Longevity Center." A deli for dieters? Only in 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
But wait, there's more to come. Next March Citrus' Michel Richard, Bruce Marder 
of West Beach Cafe, DC 3 and Rebecca's and investor Marvin Zeidler will open 
yet another deli -- one that promises to redefine L.A. deli for all time. It 
will be a vast architect-designed space (larger than the Carnegie), where they 
will cure their own corned beef, smoke their own pastrami, pickle their own 
vegetables. They plan to bake their own bread -- in a wood burning oven, no 
less -- and have chickens and turkeys turning on a rosticceria. And that's not 
all. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a soda fountain and a wine store. There will be outdoor seating. 
The bar will serve cappuccino and croissants in the morning, beer and sausages 
at lunch, hard stuff in the evening. The kitchen will be open, the cases filled 
with salads. And wait until you taste the cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
But there is even more on the local deli horizon. When the Eureka Brewery opens 
at the end of the year it will have a restaurant designed by Barbara Lazaroff. 
And what will it be serving? International deli food by Wolfgang Puck (who is 
already making his own salami in anticipation). 
</P>
<P>
The deli may have been born in New York, but right now it's being bred in Los 
Angeles. It may never be the same. This American institution is replacing the 
cafe, for Los Angeles is reinventing the deli and claiming it as its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie Deli, 300 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 276-DELI. Open 
daily. Hours at the moment are 7 a.m.-8 p.m. No alcohol (liquor license is 
pending). Valet parking in the evening. All major credit cards accepted.

A 'CITY' OF SURVIVORS; 
</P>
<P>
THE WEST'S SECOND CITY IS IN THE BLACK DESPITE DEFECTIONS IN THE RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five months ago, the Second City comedy troupe launched its first major 
invasion of the West Coast and established a beachhead at the old Mayfair 
Theatre in Santa Monica, bringing with it lots of promise and plenty of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
The promise had to do with the troupe's potential for pumping fresh air into 
the torpid inversion layer that the entertainment industry here casts over 
talent, enveloping and invisibly affecting it. It also had to do with Second 
City's capacity to offer local audiences a linkup with their experience that 
could bypass television and the movies. 
</P>
<P>
The main question, simply put, was whether the ensemble could survive. 
</P>
<P>
After five months, it's still here and still, in many respects -- mainly 
commercial -- healthy. But the company has suffered attrition and in its revues 
hasn't yet come up with a personal style and point of view -- indispensable 
elements of first-rate work. 
</P>
<P>
What the troupe seemed most concerned about when it arrived in February was 
defection in the ranks, and that's happened. Robin Duke, Chris Barnes and Dana 
Anderson have stayed on, but Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have left for commercial 
acting jobs. John Hemphill has gone home to Toronto either to work on a 
screenplay or take care of personal finances or because he became homesick -- 
it depends on whom you ask. (He declined to give an interview.) 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, no other comedy group has supplied more major talent to America's 
entertainment scene than Second City, which opened its doors in 1959 in what 
was once a Chinese laundry shop in Chicago. Shelley Berman, Mike Nichols and 
Elaine May, Alan Alda, Robert Klein, John Belushi, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, 
Valerie Harper, Tom O'Horgan, the entire SCTV cast out of Toronto and Paul 
Mazursky are only some of the nearly 300 high-profile veterans who have fanned 
out through television, movies and the theater. 
</P>
<P>
But even with that pedigree, success is hardly a sure thing. For a performing 
troupe to catch the Zeitgeist in a revealing way or to penetrate the momentous 
heart of a matter, the shared frequency of ensemble work is essential. Moliere 
had it in his Comedie Francaise. Sid Caesar had it with "Your Show of Shows." 
Andrew Alexander, who co-owns Second City (with silent partner Len Stuart), has 
never had it for long and has spent innumerable hours trying to figure out how 
to keep it. (His creation of the SCTV network was an anguished defensive 
measure after Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner were spirited out of Second City by 
NBC's "Saturday Night Live.") 
</P>
<P>
All along in his Los Angeles designs, Alexander knew there was no way he could 
bring a small band of his top Toronto and Chicago players to the bosom of the 
entertainment industry, pay it a subsistence wage while all around were awash 
in cushy development deals, and not expect at least some of the company to 
bolt. So he devised a few stratagems. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than try to insulate his company from the flurry of commercial offers 
that were sure to pile in like junk mail, he enlisted as co-president of Second 
City Entertainment a veteran industry executive who has worked in media 
acquisitions and personal management, Michael Rollens. 
</P>
<P>
Rollens is an insider who well knows that the principal art form in Hollywood 
is the art of the deal. He brought Second City and Imagine Films together as 
part owners in his management company. In addition to working their regular 
schedule under Actors Equity, the company was offered holding fees by the 
networks for the development efforts of its members (who were then individually 
paid). They were also guaranteed producer's royalties for anything they sold. 
</P>
<P>
That was the best Alexander could do to ensure that the center would hold. Has 
it? 
</P>
<P>
"The artistry is coming along," he said, tacitly conceding that the work has 
suffered. "There was an awful lot of pressure in the beginning to open the show 
and then work on TV commitments. I see a much stronger kernel in the sets now." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander reports that the theater, which operates out of a monthly budget of 
$155,000, is in the black and that a number of commercial projects are on the 
verge of being finalized. They include a pilot that's been financed for 
syndication; a half-hour sitcom "that's about to go on its feet" for a major 
network; a prime-time sketch show that will be offered to two TV networks, and 
a couple of possibilities for cable outlets. (This doesn't include in-the-works 
projects by individual company members. Joe Flaherty, for example, has a 
development deal with Castle Rock Productions.) 
</P>
<P>
In February, Alexander said that development deals had been signed with CBS and 
NBC, and an agreement had been struck with Imagine films for TV production and 
a first look at any movie project (Imagine's financing and distribution was to 
be made through Universal/MCA); all this in addition to a TV pilot deal with 
Second City alumnus, writer-producer-director Steve Kampmann. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Alexander and Rollens are keeping silent on any details. "I wish I 
could tell you," Rollens said, "but the negotiations and the business are at 
such a delicate phase right now that we can't afford to say anything 
prematurely. I can tell you we've accomplished a great deal in three or four 
months. I just can't be specific. In three weeks from now, we expect to be able 
to make some major announcements." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, while all these TV deals grind invisibly along in mysterious 
industry peristalsis, what about the theater? 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned from this experience that it's important to keep people together 
and not pull them from different groups," Alexander said. "The Experimental 
Theater Company in (suburban) Chicago has developed a particularly strong point 
of view right now. So has our Toronto group. L.A. is a very seductive town. 
It's very easy to get drawn into things that aren't right for you. But an 
ensemble has to be like an orchestra. You have to take time to learn how to 
play together." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cast is happy staying put. "I got a call for an 'Adam 12' (the TV 
police-series revival) and I told them I don't drive," said Chris Barnes, who 
has found himself a nearly impossible-to-find, two-bedroom, rent-controlled 
apartment in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, to jump to a sitcom right now is to deny why I came to Second City. 
You can always jump, but for me there are more things I need to work at, like 
finding the irony in an issue. Political cartoonists can do it in one panel. I 
need a panorama. I don't need to do all the work and study I'm doing in order 
to wind up playing a wacky neighbor in a sitcom. L.A. is not Hollywood. I have 
neighbors. They get up in the morning and go to work every day. There's a 
hotbed of issues here, just like anywhere else." (Barnes is at work on a sitcom 
for CBS -- as a writer.) 
</P>
<P>
"I avoid the commercial pressures," said Robin Duke (who once had a stint with 
"Saturday Night Live"). "The theater is enough. One day there may be time to do 
something else, but during the day you have to have a normal life you can draw 
upon so that you're not just doing scenes about auditions. The struggle is to 
make the work you're doing as strong as it can be." 
</P>
<P>
"The turnover in Second City has always been high," said Dana Anderson. "It 
hurts the process. You miss people, but the work is always there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Flaherty, the company's nominal artistic director (who is now on 
hiatus): "You need time to develop -- a year, six months at the least. We made 
a commitment to present a bunch of ideas to TV, and then, with the show, it 
just became too crazy. It's easy to see why people would jump. Patching 
together a development deal is a lot harder than signing up for a part on a 
series. There's no money in brainstorming. It's very hard to resist the 
temptation of using the revue as a showcase, to use the stage as a play to get 
into the movies." 
</P>
<P>
As for the company's uncertain artistic focus, he said: "It's the same thing we 
faced in Toronto, when we had to borrow a lot of what was being done in 
Chicago. In the beginning we were always coming up two or three scenes short, 
and needed to do that. But it was less and less as time went on. We never liked 
doing it. What you need is an ongoing company. You need to develop your own 
stuff. L.A. is a city without a pulse. We're in the era of stand-up now too, 
instead of the revue-oriented presentation. The greatest challenge is to keep a 
group together for a year, or a couple of years. The workshops are going well. 
If they can tough it out, they'll get and keep people who know what's 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
The workshops to which Flaherty referred consist of an eight-week, 20-class 
schedule with 15 students working under the tutelage of such Second City alumni 
as Dick Shaal, Betty Thomas, Severn Darden, Mina Kolb and Jim Fisher. Andrew 
Alexander hopes to put the best of those young students into a national touring 
company that would support the main companies. 
</P>
<P>
Co-founder David Shepherd put out a manifesto in the '50s that described the 
Second City's intentions: "In order for a theater to be an institution, its 
audiences must love and hate it as they love and hate the church and the 
President. . . . The goal of our theater should be a riot in the audience. . . 
. Poetry can't appear overnight, because it's been dead in us a long time, but 
a certain kind of excitement can." 
</P>
<P>
And in February Alexander said: "This is a town where people go their own way. 
If we could stay together as a family, despite occasional squabbles, we could 
make things change." 
</P>
<P>
No one in the company begrudges the fate of the people who have left, and Ryan 
Stiles, Richard Kind and Diane Stilwell have stepped into the breach, as 
theater pros would. 
</P>
<P>
But no one right now expects the kind of excitement that Shepherd envisioned 
when Second City was a young, green outfit with no desire or need to 
accommodate a gargantuan entertainment industry whose watchful operatives seem 
to be scattered in every audience. And obviously Alexander's wish for 
togetherness has turned out to be a late winter hope that vanished with the 
pilot season of spring. 
</P>
<P>
Very few ideas and changes really start with movies and television. They begin 
instead with the exchange among human beings, alone together without commercial 
interruption. That's why the theater will always have its urgent place, and 
that's why Second City hopes to keep on, though it's won no major battles so 
far.

THE GETTY GETS IT RIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
PERHAPS MONEY CAN BUY ARTISTIC HAPPINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sir Kenneth Clark came to the Wild West in 1978 to lecture at the Getty Museum 
which was just getting started as the world's richest art repository. In those 
days he was a rare combination of authentically brilliant art historian and -- 
because of his television series "Civilisation" -- a cultural celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Kindly and tactful, he praised the progress made by the Getty's antiquities 
department but when an interviewer solicited his opinion of the painting 
collection he demured diplomatically. The question was about to pass when he 
murmured, as if to himself, "Funny how they never get the pictures galleries 
right . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He died in 1983 so we'll never know how he would feel now. Probably he'd revise 
his estimate, if not change it. The Getty has made brave strides since the days 
when it's hottest paintings were a Rubens of questioned authenticity and a 
campy-erotic academic Bougereau of a girl flirtatiously defending herself 
against Cupid. 
</P>
<P>
Poor old museum. All the money in the world to buy the best paintings in the 
universe at a time when most masterpieces are eternally frozen in the corridors 
of Louvres, Uffizis and National Galleries. Sigh. If this were the Renaissance 
the Getty's director, John Walsh, could just hire himself a condottiere and a 
bunch of Swiss mercenaries and go plunder a Prado. 
</P>
<P>
In these pallid times, however, subtler methods are required. Today, you just 
pay multiple millions for the best available picture by a master famous only 
amongst connoisseurs, scholars and mavens and then sit back and wait for 
experts and opportunists to attack it as a fake. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty is a fun place to go these warm summer days. If you need a fresh 
reason, the museum's latest and arguably greatest coup has recently come on 
public view. It is, of course, the 1538 portrait of Cosimo I de Medici painted 
by Jacopo Carucci da Pontormo, a Florentine Mannerist master of whom most 
citizens had not heard before the Getty made him front-page famous by paying a 
record price for his picture at a New York auction. 
</P>
<P>
Loll on the balcony a bit before going in. The view over the museums atrium 
garden somehow takes the mind off absurd matters like paintings going for $35.4 
million. How can a painting be worth that? Well, how can a Batmobile bomber be 
worth $600 million. The garden is limpid fantasy but its faux Roman bronzes and 
splashy bleached lime fountain are more convincing than our media-generated 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
When you step inside out of the dazzling California light you're blinded for a 
minute and a chartreuse after-image blots out the works in the galleries. Might 
as well troop the collection while your eyes adjust. 
</P>
<P>
Funny. The Getty used to say it would never collect modern art but significant 
numbers of its best and most important paintings are modern or close to it. 
Edvard Munch is surely a modern master and his 1893 "Starry Night" is like a 
more depressed pendant to Van Gogh's version of the same subject. Terrific 
picture with its obsessive bruised-black shapes of haunted trees. Everybody 
counts the Belgian James Ensor along with the Norwegian Munch as a direct 
precursor of modern Expressionism. Ensor's huge cartoon-like "The Entry of 
Christ Into Brussels" is a key historical icon and the Getty's got it. 
</P>
<P>
You know what? These Expressionists actually do fit in with the Getty's Old 
Masters. Some certainly accidental combination of available works and 
curatorial sensibility has conspired to give the ensemble an aura of, well, 
oddness. There is something inescapably neurotic about Alesandro Magnasco's 
icky and operatic "Bacchanale." Dosso Dossi's mythological scene has his 
characteristic disturbed visionary naivete. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair to the collection to tack down such impressions as gospel. 
It is neither all on the walls nor arranged as the museum would like. 
Historically, it moves in fits and starts. Sense -- if it is to come -- will 
have to wait until sometime in the 1990s when they open their new citadel in 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
There are calm and classic works in the collection like the brilliant Degas 
owned jointly with Norton Simon, a sparkling small Veronese and a magisterial 
Van Dyke but frankly their presence only dramatizes the persistently offbeat 
note sounded even by some of their outstanding works. Carpaccio is known for 
poetic strangeness. George de la Tour's "Beggars Brawl" resonates with terrible 
venality. Jean-Baptise Greuze's moral allegories get caught with their hand in 
the cookie jar. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty has never aspired to encyclopedic completeness. Its aesthetic sense 
is attracted to the same grail that seems to pervade the collective unconscious 
of at least every other high-ranking artnik in this geography. You want to see 
strong and dignified men tremble with something akin to religious ecstasy? 
Enter their august halls and whisper, "The Frick." 
</P>
<P>
Art barons around her just go all gooseflesh at the thought of the Frick Museum 
in New York -- a private mansion opened as a small public museum where the the 
masterpieces, largely unrelated historically, are every last one a jewel. The 
place is Mecca for art connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
And guess what. The famous Pontormo hung for a number of years in the Frick. No 
wonder the Getty wanted it. A piece of the Frick is as good as a saint's tibia 
any day. 
</P>
<P>
And here it is. 
</P>
<P>
Not large. Standard cabinet-size portrait. Cosimo I de Medici is depicted at 
age 18 as a soldier leaning on his pike. His sword hilt stands erect and is so 
placed as to offend any right-wing senator who might perchance understand 
symbolism. The woozily elongated torso looks unreal with its pinched waist and 
manikin chest under a putty-colored tunic. The Mannerists were into stylishness 
with a vengeance. They loved sour piquant color and the trick is done here by a 
clanging red cap against a glum green background. 
</P>
<P>
Cosimo's face and hands are at once virile and delicately waxen. He wears and 
expression of adolescent languor -- cherub lips slightly slack, eyes awash in 
aqueous fluid. Not many painters can give us that sense of the eyeball floating 
in its socket. The whole is slightly disembodied as if the figure were made of 
some gelatinous material that absorbs and radiates light. 
</P>
<P>
The middle chunk of the 16th Century was not a happy time for art. The 
Mannerist epoch -- wedged between the high classicism of Raphael and the beefy 
optimism of the Baroque -- is an art shadowed with anxious doubt. In some ways 
Hamlet is the central figure of the time. Doubt was sparked by Martin Luther's 
Reformation, anxiety by Charles V's sack of Rome and the Spanish domination of 
Italy. The art that grew from this unstable soil is often seen as a harbinger 
of two facets of modernism -- dandyism and asceticism. The poet John Donne 
started as a cavalier and ended and a metaphysical divine. Painting art 
produced both the attenuated chic of Parmigianino and the mysticism of El 
Greco. 
</P>
<P>
La maniera became associated with impending doom and the cultivation of a 
sensibility that consciously waffles between decadence and austerity like the 
yuppies who do coke all night and go to the gym in the morning. It's an 
end-of-the-world attitude that showed up among the symbolists as the 19th 
Century guttered out and is among us again as irony as the 20th Century fades 
-- albeit the giantism of much current art argues for a kind of Mannerist 
Baroque. 
</P>
<P>
Mannerist artists are often cited as personality-prototypes for modern artists 
-- exquisitely ultrasensitive, brilliant and a bit mad. 
</P>
<P>
Pontormo, born in 1494, was orphaned in childhood and raised by his grandmother 
in Florence. According to Vasari, he was a prodigy who studied with Leonardo da 
Vinci, Piero di Cosimo and Andrea del Sarto, among others. He had early success 
and as a teen-ager already showed temperamental signs when he complained that a 
work in which he had a minor role was unveiled without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
As his success grew he became touchier, refusing to work for clients he didn't 
like. He was a loner who built a house where the bedroom was accessible only by 
a ladder he pulled up after him. One biographer says he was a compulsive 
record-keeper meticulously noting even his most minor activities -- including 
the times when the notes were made. 
</P>
<P>
Pontormo spent the last 11 years of his life working on a chapel decoration 
which he would allow no one to see -- including the patron who footed the bill. 
Vasari say he was so afraid of death he would allow no one to mention it in his 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help. He succumbed in 1557. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Getty has a prime work by this unsettled master. Its strangeness is 
part of its authenticity and seeing it one is content to believe that it was 
the finest Old Master painting left in private hands. Now it properly belongs 
to everybody and the Getty is slowly getting the pictures galleries right.

WHAT AMERICA WATCHES -- AND WHY;

GEOGRAPHY IS OFTEN A KEY TO A SHOW'S RATINGS, CRITICS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the infancy of television, many people had their first magical glimpse of a 
broadcast in a neighbor's house. Others caught the spreading TV contagion from 
the set over the bar in the neighborhood tavern. But no matter where they 
watched it, people generally watched television together. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evenings in 1948, there was a sense that Americans who could find 
their way to one of the roughly 900,000 TV sets in the country were gathered 
together like a huge family to watch crackling transmissions of "The Milton 
Berle Show." 
</P>
<P>
Such a sense of community is mostly gone in television today. It was fragmented 
when lower-priced TV sets flooded the market and new technologies 
revolutionized the broadcast industry. In 1948, a boxy, small-screen, 
black-and-white TV set cost as much as $400 (more than $1,700 in 1989 dollars); 
for $400 now you can buy a quality 20-inch, color monitor with stereo 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
There are 90.4 million television households now -- 98% of American homes -- 
many of them with two or three TV sets. Of those households, 62% have at least 
one VCR, and 56% receive cable television, which in some cases provides more 
than 40 additional viewing choices. 
</P>
<P>
With so many sets and so many viewing options, what is America tuning in to now 
-- and, more specifically, why? That was the question tossed to a clan of TV 
critics, gathered in Los Angeles for the television industry's annual summer 
press tour. 
</P>
<P>
Among their insights about TV viewing habits in their respective markets: 
"Beauty and the Beast" has a huge following in Pittsburgh. New Yorkers flip 
channels a lot. Many people in Dallas don't like "Dallas." In Birmingham, Ala., 
viewers love Andy Griffith reruns. A disproportionate number of TV writers and 
producers hail from Buffalo, N.Y. Arsenio Hall goes over big in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the greatest democracies going -- television I'm talking about, 
not the United States," said television critic Mark Dawidziak of the Beacon 
Journal in Akron, Ohio. "Everybody has an opinion about television and 
everybody is going to give you that opinion through what they watch. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable has diversified television to the extent that if you like sports, news, 
movies or music, there's an entire channel for you. The VCR has completed that 
democratic equation. Now, you not only have a lot more choices, but you don't 
have to watch a show when broadcasters tell you to watch it. You can watch it 
when you want to watch it." 
</P>
<P>
The critics' comments suggested that when it comes to television, America is 
not a melting pot but rather a salad bowl in which everyone's viewing tastes 
and preferences are tossed together. 
</P>
<P>
With the proliferation of cable channels and increases in local programming, 
the major networks no longer are unchallenged rulers of the TV airwaves. The 
networks are steadily losing their audience. A look at A.C. Nielson Co. figures 
reveals that the networks drew only 68% of the total television audience during 
prime time in the 1988-89 television season, compared to 92% 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that the networks are missing their mark and that the failure 
rate for new shows is well over 80%. One reason, they suggest, is that most 
network shows are written and produced in either New York or Los Angeles and 
thus display a coastal attitude that viewers in other parts of the country 
cannot identify with. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old joke: What is America to a network executive? It's what he 
flies over while traveling from the East Coast to the West Coast," said Los 
Angeles Times TV critic Howard Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"All of television reflects a very white, middle-class mentality because those 
are the people who control television," Rosenberg said. "Everything made for 
commercial television is seen through the prism of its makers." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robert Strauss of the New Jersey-based Asbury Park Press: "The networks 
still draw millions of viewers, so they must know something. But it still seems 
to be a vastly New York-Los Angeles world that we see on television. Because 
the shows are created mostly in New York and Los Angeles, all the references, 
the locales and the settings exist in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Tribune writer Larry Wexler said: "ABC is coming out with Jackie 
Mason's new show this fall. It's called 'Chicken Soup.' I don't think it's 
going to do real well. It's about a Jewish guy and a Gentile woman, and Mason's 
type of humor is urban, more sophisticated. It might do fine in New York or 
Philadelphia, but I don't think it will play in Dubuque, Iowa, and smaller 
towns like that. They just won't get it." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that one reason ABC's hausfrau "Roseanne" mopped up in the ratings 
last season is because her character is a departure from the high society of 
New York or the laid-back beaches of Los Angeles. Tom Feran, TV critic for the 
Cleveland Plain Dealer, said: " 'Roseanne' was bigger, faster in Cleveland than 
most anywhere in the country. I remember the first time I saw the pilot I 
thought, 'This looks like a documentary.' It has a no-nonsense kind of 
sensibility. Cleveland is a town that works, that produces. There's a real 
appreciation for her." 
</P>
<P>
Of course not all network shows are set in New York or Los Angeles. "Roseanne" 
fires her one-liners from Lanford, Ill. The backdrop for NBC's "Cheers" is a 
bar in Boston. In CBS' "Murder, She Wrote," Angela Lansbury -- when not 
free-lancing on the road -- solves mysteries from her home in Cabot Cove, Me. 
And the titles of CBS' "Dallas" and "Miami Vice" reveal still other locales. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of shows are set in (Chicago), but that doesn't seem to have any impact 
on anyone because none of them are really shot there," said TV writer Joel 
Brown of the Daily Southtown Economist in Chicago. "They might do a few things 
behind the titles. You see Bronson Pinchot and Mark Linn Baker from 'Perfect 
Strangers' go out and run by the Wrigley Building, and down by the Chicago 
River, and maybe to the fountain in Grand Park, then we don't see them in the 
city again until they need some winter establishing shots. The rest of the show 
is standard, three-camera sitcom stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Oftentimes, using "outside" cities as settings backfires. The exaggerated 
stereotypes that television creates can alienate viewers in different 
television markets, especially when the story takes place in that market. The 
larger the area that the show mimics, the greater the potential audience loss. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' "Heartland," which finished 43rd nationally out of 69 shows in the Nielson 
ratings last week, is a sitcom about a three-generation family on a Nebraska 
farm. Barry Garron, television critic for the Kansas City Star in Missouri, 
said that the show, which stars Brian Keith, "may have been more rejected in 
the Midwest than elsewhere because people in the Midwest realize how stupid a 
portrayal of Midwestern life that is." 
</P>
<P>
"The show 'Heartland,' which is supposed to be about a farm family in the 
Midwest, clearly shows no indication of life in the Midwest," said Ron 
Weiskind, television and radio critic for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. "In 
fact, I don't know of anybody who lives like that or talks like that or acts 
like that. It's just writers writing jokes that have no relation to real life. 
And that's one reason shows like that don't last very long." 
</P>
<P>
At least one element of life in the American heartland does help draw viewers 
to the television set -- the weather. In regions outside the West Coast and the 
Deep South, the significance of TV to potential viewers increases as the 
temperature falls. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to do things outdoors, but in the wintertime they become 
prisoners," Feran of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said. "For a large portion of 
the year it gets dark early, it gets cold and TV becomes a major activity. 
That's why 'Lonesome Dove,' which was big everywhere, was especially big in 
Cleveland. It came on about the first week of February, and it was just a 
bitterly cold week. 'Lonesome Dove' was like a little vacation. You could go 
home and it was on every night. It was escapist, warm-weather fare." 
</P>
<P>
"In Miami it's warm all year around, so you don't have the blitz in ratings in 
the winter you have in the rest of the country," TV critic Steve Sonsky of the 
Miami Herald said. "In spring, HUT levels (homes using television) drop off 
considerably in other markets because people start going outdoors again. 
They're more stable in Miami. You don't have that precipitous drop-off. If 
people watch less TV in the winter, it's not because of the weather, it's 
because there's nothing good to watch." 
</P>
<P>
In some markets, matters are complicated by network promotional spots. "We're 
peculiar because we're in the Mountain time zone, which is sort of a stepchild 
time zone," said Joanne Ostrow, TV critic of the Denver Post. "When they 
advertise their upcoming shows, the networks will tell you that it comes on at 
'10 o'clock Central and 8 o'clock Pacific,' but they won't tell you what the 
Mountain time zone is. 
</P>
<P>
"There are advantages. You don't have to stay up all night to watch David 
Letterman, who comes on at 11:30 p.m. A disadvantage is, if you have young 
children, our prime time starts at 7 p.m. So the 9 p.m. shows, which the 
networks save for more more violent programming, are on at 8 p.m. in Denver -- 
when kids are still up." 
</P>
<P>
Of the critics polled, none expressed concern with the content of network 
programming. Several said that special-interest advocates who receive media 
attention -- such as Terry Rakolta, who made waves among Fox Broadcasting's 
advertisers with her letter-writing campaign objecting to the raw sitcom 
"Married . . . With Children" -- have narrow agendas and do not represent most 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, if there was anything risque, I would hear about it very 
quickly," said Alan Pergament, TV critic for the Buffalo News in New York. 
"Buffalo is a conservative town, but nobody in Buffalo is concerned with those 
issues. From my judgment, special-interest groups have way too much power. I 
don't think they accurately represent Buffalo or any other market." 
</P>
<P>
Among the networks, CBS and ABC are trailing NBC in the ratings nationally. But 
network rankings often differ in local markets, depending on the popularity of 
the networks' affiliates in each area. 
</P>
<P>
"My market, and any market, is controlled largely by the strength of its 
affiliate stations," said Art Chapman, television critic for the Ft. Worth 
Star-Telegram in Texas. "While ABC may be perched very dangerously between 
second and third place, ABC remains the No. 1 network in my market because the 
ABC affiliate in my market is the strongest of the affiliates. That station has 
the best equipment and management." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most visible draws of a network affiliate is the quality of its 
local newscasts. There was a feeling among many of the critics interviewed that 
a viewer who tunes in to a local evening news program is more likely to stick 
around and see what that network has to offer in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the blue-collar values in our market show up on the local newscasts," 
Dawidziak of the Beacon Journal in Ohio said. "There's a loyalty to the 
reporters who have been around for a while and stay around. Unstable stations 
where faces come and go a lot don't do well in the ratings, but stations that 
have someone reporting who's been around for 16, 17 years, they take those 
people into their hearts and are loyal to them." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, a strong newscast from an independent station can take a bite out 
of the ratings of a larger network affiliate. "The obvious thing in the 
Miami-Ft. Lauderdale market is the large influence of Latins," Sonsky of the 
Miami Herald said. "There are two Spanish-language stations on the air in Miami 
that have a big influence on local news and ratings. A large portion of the 
older Latin Americans watch the Spanish news, which makes a big dent in the 
local market. The 6 p.m. news on Channel 23, one of the Spanish stations, has a 
larger audience share than any of the four English-speaking news shows at that 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"One sad trend in Portland," said Erik Bergman, associate editor of the 
Portland-based magazine TV Host, "is that news staffs are getting cut down. 
News is getting too costly. A major amount of people in our market turn to TV 
for news, and that can't be overestimated. Beyond entertainment, people want to 
know what happened last night or this morning. It's a shame news is being cut 
back. It seems that the only visionary is Ted Turner with CNN, which has 
expanded and is linking the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
As cable television and VCRs continue to infiltrate network programming, TV 
critics say that the networks' lowest-common-denominator audience will dry up. 
One media writer said that the networks -- using the abundance of demographic 
information available to them -- should "de-massify" their audiences. The 
writer said the technology is available to simultaneously broadcast different 
programs developed for specific parts of the country, in the same way that 
magazines such as TV Guide publish listings and editorial content to match 
separate TV markets and time zones. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the critics feel that the networks have failed to react after being 
caught in a storm of change. "Most viewers are going to tell you they don't 
notice a difference in TV from 10 years ago," said Ann McGuire, editor of New 
York-based magazine Total Television. "It's the same. It's the same stuff. (The 
major networks) really haven't gone out of their way to do anything new. Look 
at the technology around, the way everything is coming into the home, computers 
and things. And TV has stayed the same. They brought back 'Columbo.' They're 
bringing back 'Kojak.' Is there a shortage of ideas here?" 
</P>

A Swing Across the Nation During 'Sweeps' 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at 10 geographical diverse Nielsen TV markets. The Ratings are 
for April 27 -- May 24, the latest "sweeps," a period when viewership is 
measured in every market. There are 210 Nielsen markets (areas served by the 
same major TV stations). They are ranked according to number of households; the 
rankings of those cited here appear in front of the area's name.

WHO HAS THE RIGHT STUFF FOR THE PART?; 
</P>
<P>
IN CASTING, THE ACTOR'S PERSONALITY IS NOT ALWAYS CONSIDERED A PLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Wrong for the part. The phrase comes up a lot when performances are being 
discussed. I used it myself the other day in regard to Topol's portrayal of 
Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof." What does it mean, to be "wrong for the part"? 
What does it mean to be right for the part? 
</P>
<P>
And in whose opinion? The critic may think that actor X is out-of-sync with 
character Y, but the producer and director obviously thought that they were a 
match -- or, at least, that they would sell tickets together. And often they 
do. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Broadway show whose time is running out will often hire a star 
name to keep the customers coming -- Joan Rivers as the mother in "Broadway 
Bound," Tony Randall as the diplomat in "M. Butterfly." Not the people who 
would have been cast for the role in the first place, perhaps, but high-profile 
personalities who fall within the general requirements of the part. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes it works. David Bowie did "Elephant Man" in Chicago a few summers 
ago, and he was elegant. On the other hand, Richard Burton went into "Equus" as 
a warm-up for the movie, and he was flat. You never know. 
</P>
<P>
That goes for casting in general. Only one principle applies: Theater is about 
pretending. If the actor helps the audience to pretend in the right direction, 
he or she has been well cast. If not, not. 
</P>
<P>
Start with the question of physical type. It is not as crucial as one might 
think. Yes, the player has to show whether the character is male or female, 
young or old, hearty or frail. We're not doing radio here. 
</P>
<P>
However, the eye is rather easily satisfied in the theater. It will settle for 
a few carefully selected details, rather than insisting on a complete bill of 
particulars, as when watching a movie. That's how Claudette Colbert can still 
get away with it on stage, to everybody's delight. 
</P>
<P>
Or, consider the all-male casts of Shakespeare's day. Audiences were able to 
look at a gangly boy actor and see Ophelia. A play registers in the 
imagination, not on the retina. That's why the argument against racially mixed 
casts is so weak. A black Hamlet takes about three minutes to get used to . . . 
if he makes us think of a prince. A short Prince Hamlet might take longer to 
get used to. When Judith Anderson played the role years ago at ACT, that was 
the major impediment: Her Medea. But her Hamlet seemed to be about a boy 
prince, and that wasn't the story. 
</P>
<P>
But don't be quick to say what the story is. The right actor can make it a new 
one. For years we thought of Willy Loman as being a biggish man, simply because 
he was first played by a biggish actor, Lee J. Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Then Dustin Hoffman showed us that Willy could just as well be seen a little 
guy -- the mascot who always wanted to make the team. Without invalidating the 
previous image, Hoffman provided an alternative view of it. That's how the 
great theater roles grow over the centuries -- a ring at a time. 
</P>
<P>
But if the eye is tolerant in theater, the ear makes demands. About two-thirds 
of what's going on with a character will be conveyed by the actor's voice. This 
does have to suit the character -- and the style of the play. Funny voices and 
funky accents will set up the wrong associations, which is a well-trained actor 
has purged himself of whatever localisms he grew up, and has learned to speak a 
clear, neutral English that smacks of nowhere in particular. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't affected. It's practical. If Desdemona has a Valley accent, it's 
going to set up a train of thought that is not to the story's purpose -- unless 
the director has set the story in the Valley. Looking the part isn't half as 
important as sounding it. Now the fun starts. Assuming that Actor X fits the 
role physically and vocally, how does he fit it temperamentally? What does he 
bring to the part that another actor wouldn't? How does he "read" on stage? 
What's his aura? 
</P>
<P>
Producers, directors, casting directors and critics talk about these things all 
the time. Their answers can be intensely subjective. Many an actor has 
profited, or lost, from setting up signals within the appraiser's emotional 
field akin to those once aroused by the appraiser's Aunt Clara. 
</P>
<P>
But auras aren't totally imaginary. Audiences do pick up on the signals that 
actors send out, whether they mean to or not. Actors do project qualities that 
can augment a role, or diminish it, or muddle it. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Merman in "Gypsy"? Perfect. Ethel Merman in "Three Sisters"? Not unless 
you made her the noisy sister-in-law, and even then she might wreck the show. 
Chopin can't be played on the trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
Tyne Daly in "Gypsy"? Absolutely. Got the brains and got the guts. Daly as Lola 
in LATC's "Come Back, Little Sheba"? Well . . . she made it work. 
</P>
<P>
Topol in "Fiddler"? Magnificent physical casting. Probably the most masterly 
performance of Tevye that we've seen. But the persona is so monumental that we 
lost sight of Teyve's insecurities and little ironies. Topol as Moses? Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
How about Mark Harelik in Vaclav Havel's "Temptation" at the Taper? Clearly, 
this was a judgment call on the part of director Richard Jordan. Harelik reads 
as a very American type: the guy who doesn't mean any harm. 
</P>
<P>
He's good therefore when it comes to showing the innocent side of Havel's hero, 
who thinks he can play the Devil against the authorities and somehow come out a 
winner. But he doesn't project the man's crafty side, something a more cerebral 
actor (someone suggested Sam Waterston) would have had no trouble conveying. 
The result doesn't help us figure out a play that's none too clear to begin 
with. 
</P>
<P>
We do expect the actor to provide answers here, even when they contradict the 
answer the last actor gave. Elizabeth Huddle played Christopher Durang's Sister 
Mary Ignatius as a superficially jolly nun who had grown up watching Ingrid 
Bergman in "The Bell's of St. Mary's." Then Lynn Redgrave stepped in and made 
her an Irish nun with no sense of humor at all. 
</P>
<P>
Who was right? They were both right. But it would be possible to be wrong about 
Sister Mary, too. For instance, you could cast her with an actress who played 
her so vitriollically (think of Estelle Parsons in "Miss Margarida's Way") that 
the play lost all its laughter and become an anti-Catholic diatribe. Overtones, 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
Actors can't escape them. Laurence Olivier prided himself on having no personal 
qualities at all as an actor -- it all depended on what nose he put on. But the 
obituarists agreed that Olivier had a natural leaning towards comedy, and that 
he was never more happily cast than when playing a rascal like Archie Rice or 
Richard III. 
</P>
<P>
John Gielgud's aura, on the other hand, is mellow and intellectual. There 
always was something autumnal about Gielgud's work, and the older he grows, the 
more enchanted it becomes. (It's time that someone filmed him as Prospero.) 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it came to playing warrior-men like Othello, Gielgud has said that he 
had to "pretend like mad." And watching Olivier as Big Daddy on TV, the 
audience had to pretend like mad. No matter how big the talent, it's always 
possible to be wrong for the part.

COMPARING NOTES WITH LUTOSLAWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOGDAN GIERACZYNSKI, Gieraczynski is an editor and critic who lives in 
Warsaw. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 76, Witold Lutoslawski stands as one of the seminal figures of post-World 
War II composition. Writing in most instrumental forms, he has had an impact in 
the musical world far out of proportion to his relatively small output. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his struggle toward a personal style early, notating compositions at 
age 9. During the war, his efforts were necessarily submerged, as he played in 
a piano-duo in a Warsaw cafe. Afterward, he found the arts bureaucracy of 
Stalinist Poland unreceptive to his work, but by the mid-1950s was gaining a 
reputation as a conductor of his own works in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski has championed his cause in Los Angeles, most recently in 1985. On 
Monday he will talk about his music and life with Los Angeles Philharmonic 
composer-in-residence Steven Stucky at UCLA. Wednesday at Royce Hall he will 
lead the Philharmonic Institute Orchestra in a program of his own compositions: 
"Chain III" (1986), the West Coast premiere of the First Symphony (1947) and 
the Cello Concerto (1970) with Institute director Lynn Harrell as soloist. 
Institute members will also offer his String Quartet on a chamber music program 
Friday, also at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 A conversation with the avant-garde composer: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: One of your characteristic traits is your unwillingness to 
compromise in your creative work, your expression of truth through your music. 
What does the concept "truth" mean in relation to such a non-semantic art as 
music? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: What I understand by truth in a piece of music is a genuine, honest 
expression of what you have to convey to others. Loyalty to yourself, to your 
own aesthetics, to your own aims. . . . A piece of music is true when it 
reflects a personal, original artistic conviction without regard for the 
consequences. You may wonder whether this position is not utterly egocentric 
and whether society needs art created on the basic of such principles. It is my 
deep conviction that society needs only such art. A work based on lies, on the 
abandonment of principles for the sake of transitory, capricious aims like 
pleasing the tastes of critics or the public, just to get applause or fame or 
money -- those are the works that are not the products of purely artistic 
motivation! 
</P>
<P>
Q: The 20th Century has granted the intellect absolute dominance in every area 
of human endeavor, including art. What role do emotion and intuition on the one 
hand, and rationalism and intellectualism on the other, play in your work? 
</P>
<P>
A: Anyone who is well versed in the composition process cannot fail to notice 
that the rational factor dominates in my works. Mine is a deliberate, organized 
working technique -- that is true. 
</P>
<P>
However, I ascribe the most fundamental importance to what used to be called 
inspiration. Although this term may be a bit pompous and imprecise, it is an 
absolutely irreplaceable one to refer to the attitude, the spiritual state that 
is essential to the act of creation. Everything that is authentic in a piece of 
music is the result of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There are no operas in your oeuvre, and you have never permitted the use of 
your music in the ballet. As a composer you clearly imply that music is the 
most asemantic of the arts, and that any attempt to combine it with 
extra-musical matters contradicts its fundamental message. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A: I have always subscribed to an abstract concept of music. The only 
unambiguous message that music in itself can convey is a musical one. Music is 
music! Of course, that is not an adequate definition, since we know how 
strongly music affects human emotions. What do they mean? What is their nature? 
Must these emotions be given "extra" meanings? 
</P>
<P>
Some people are inclined to interpret music in an extramusical way. . . . Less 
sensitive listeners feel alien in the world of sound; their thoughts escape to 
a realm of images or feelings that do not exist in a given piece of music. This 
is a subjective reaction to music. 
</P>
<P>
But there are people of greater musical sensitivity -- composers, for instance 
-- who do not have this anxiety reflex, who confront the sounds directly. For 
them, the sounds are part of such a rich, various beauty that they have no need 
to search for anything beyond the sounds themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1949, your First Symphony was branded a "formalist" piece and banned from 
public performance in Poland. Why was that infelicitous term so significant in 
relation to such an asemantic art as music? 
</P>
<P>
A: I never understood what that was supposed to mean. In my opinion it was 
nothing but typical "art official" jargon, useful for persecuting artists who 
retained some individuality, whose creativity didn't conform to the "socialist 
realism" that was obligatory in Poland at that time. 
</P>
<P>
But in any case, the fact remains that my symphony was labeled formalist and, 
as such, was not performed in my country for 10 years. After the last 
performance of the work at the Polish National Philharmonic Hall in 1949, the 
minister of culture stormed into the conductors' room and in front of a dozen 
people announced that a composer like me ought to be thrown under the wheels of 
a streetcar. It is interesting that this was not meant as a joke -- he was 
really furious! This story is quite true, although nowadays it does sound 
anecdotal; it is also an illustration of most artists' situation in Stalinist 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you tell me what the sources of your aesthetic, artistic and 
compositional inspiration were in these days, or even earlier? 
</P>
<P>
A: In my musical career the works of various composers have served as models 
for me. The Viennese classics, above all; Beet-hoven, as an unequaled master of 
large-scale forms in general; Haydn and Mozart as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brahms' symphonies and concertos, on the other hand, despite my sincere love 
for them, had a negative creative impact on me, and its polemical reaction is 
evident in many of my works, such as my Second Symphony or String Quartet, 
which oppose Brahms' concept of large-scale forms as a matter of principle. . . 
. I confess that I always feel exhausted after a performance of a Brahms 
symphony, concerto or even a sonata, probably because there are two main 
movements -- the first and the last -- in each of them. 
</P>
<P>
These considerations led me to search for other possibilities, and I finally 
found a solution in a two-movement large-scale form in which the first movement 
prepares for the main one to follow. . . . During the first movement, the 
listener is supposed to expect something more important to happen, and may even 
grow impatient. This is exactly the situation when the second movement appears 
and presents the main idea of the work. 
</P>
<P>
This distribution of the musical substance over time seems natural to me, and 
conforms with the psychology of the perception of music. I have composed 
several works in this form, the most characteristic being my String Quartet 
(1964) and Second Symphony (1967).

RESPECT, CONTEMPT FOR GUEST CONDUCTORS -- FROM THE MUSICIANS UNDER THEIR BATON; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MYSTERIOUS LINK BETWEEN CONDUCTOR AND ORCHESTRA?

A conductor should reconcile himself to the realization that regardless of his 
approach or temperment, the eventual result is the same -- the orchestra will 
hate him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oscar Levant, "A Smattering of Ignorance" 
</P>
<P>
As a summer sport, it hardly ranks with water-skiing or body-surfing for sheer 
visceral excitement. But for thousands of orchestra fans, the annual game of 
conductor watching at the Hollywood Bowl offers its own special thrills. 
</P>
<P>
Until mid-September, the Los Angeles Philharmonic plays host to an array of 
guest conductors, some well-known to the orchestra, some appearing with the 
orchestra for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, each series of rehearsals and concerts is a little like a blind 
date. Each visitor on the podium undergoes intense scrutiny by the players. 
</P>
<P>
"A new guest conductor in front of an orchestra is pretty much stripped naked," 
says Roy Tanabe, Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist and assistant personnel 
manager. "We're all thinking, who is this person? What does he or she have to 
offer? 
</P>
<P>
"We have to establish our sig 
</P>
<P>
nals. We have to determine not only what the conductor wants musically but also 
how he's going to convey it. I have a job to do. I need to know how much I'm 
supposed to contribute. Will I have to carry him?" 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much time to form an opinion. The Philharmonic typically has only 
one or two rehearsals for each Hollywood Bowl concert during its 11-week summer 
season, as opposed to three to five run-throughs for a subscription concert at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The distractions of working alfresco at the Bowl can also make it hard to 
concentrate. For this reason, Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist Edith Markman 
says the orchestra's relationship with Bowl guest conductors is enhanced 
greatly if the visitor has a sense of humor. Soviet conductor Yuri Temirkanov, 
who conducted several concerts at the opening of the summer season, rated high 
on this point. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great perspective," Markman says. "He got terrific results by using 
exaggeration when he rehearsed with us. So that by the time the concert came 
around, we'd clearly remember the musical point he was making. And even if you 
gave him only a little of what he wanted, it would come across." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, it helps if a visitor is well-prepared. A guest conductor must 
know his repertory perfectly, says John Mack, principal oboe of the Cleveland 
Orchestra. "He mustn't shy away from addressing problems of ensemble, pitch, 
style, note-length, anything. The more convinced a conductor is about what 
they're doing, the more the orchestra will respect the conductor." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Philharmonic's principal concertmaster Sidney Weiss, that 
respect is won or lost quickly. "We know within a matter of seconds whether 
this is going to be a rewarding experience or just time we have to put in." 
</P>
<P>
How do they know? "It's an elusive thing to define," Weiss admits. 
</P>
<P>
What activates this mysterious link between an orchestra and its conductor? 
Does it always end in bitterness, as Oscar Levant insisted? Does a warm rapport 
between conductor and players necessarily lead to satisfying Schubert? Does 
mutual distrust inevitably result in muddled Mahler? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as far as orchestral musicians are concerned, what makes a great 
conductor? 
</P>
<P>
A random poll of players around the country elicited some surprising answers. 
</P>
<P>
The first myth to be shattered was that of the clearly defined beat. Superior 
baton technique apparently is not a prerequisite for superb music-making. 
</P>
<P>
Many esteemed conductors, from Wilhelm Furtwangler to Carlo Maria Giulini, were 
notoriously lacking in the clear beat department. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think it was crucial," Weiss says. "But as the years pass, I find 
it's less and less important. For the great bulk of the standard literature -- 
a Mozart or Brahms or Tchaikovsky symphony -- once you start playing the 
movement, the pulse is self-explanatory. We don't need a traffic cop." 
</P>
<P>
Mack cites the example of his orchestra's principal guest conductor: "Vladimir 
Ashkenazy is a magnificent musician. But my friends in the audience always 
complain that he makes awkward stabbing gestures with the baton. So what if he 
makes stabbing gestures? He's making great music." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are technical skills that a first-rate conductor can't do without. 
</P>
<P>
For Nathan Stutch, who retired this spring as associate principal cello of the 
New York Philharmonic, they include a strong rhythmic sense; an ability to 
adhere to a strict tempo; a highly developed ear for intonation, balances and 
different timbral possibilities; vast insight into varying musical styles, and 
an intuitive musicality. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, a great conductor must be able to hear all, see all and know all 
about the music he performs," says the 42-year veteran of the New York 
Philharmonic. Stutch says musicians rarely encounter such a person. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, articulate speech rated low on everyone's scale. 
</P>
<P>
The way one uses language is a big part of one's personality, Tanabe said, "but 
a conductor has his whole body to use, his facial expressions, his sheer 
energy. And during a concert, there are no words. 
</P>
<P>
"A conductor should be able to rehearse the orchestra with a minimum of verbal 
communication. We don't want him to tell us, 'Play it like the blue waters 
emanating from the source of eternal light.' We want to hear 'slow, fast, loud, 
soft.' If he achieves a distinctive sound, then we allow him his blue waters 
and eternal light." 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Arnold Brostoff, a 25-year veteran of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 
concurs. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, Moses was tongue-tied, he could hardly talk. All he had to say was 'Let 
my people go!' And said (it) with intensity. That certainly meant something!" 
</P>
<P>
Loquacious conductors can "drive an orchestra crazy," Brostoff says, 
particularly when the gift of gab isn't complemented by serious conviction. He 
singles out three noted Americans for special scorn: James Levine, Leonard 
Slatkin and James Conlon. "The dishonesty, the posturing," Brostoff exclaims. 
"These people are not making a connection with the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
That connection does appear to benefit from a conductor's personal warmth and 
spirit of camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Falletta, who officially begins her first season as music director of the 
Long Beach Symphony on Sept. 16, gets high marks from many members of the 
orchestra, not only for her musicianship, but also for her engaging manner. 
</P>
<P>
"She treats us like human beings," says Long Beach violinist Jeff Gauthier. 
"She seems interested in getting to know us. There's a strong commitment there, 
both to the orchestra and to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of the most celebrated conductors of this century were not exactly 
proponents of the warm fuzzies. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Weiss, who performed in several major orchestras before joining the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic in 1979, remembers a rehearsal with the Cleveland 
Orchestra at which the late George Szell fired the entire trumpet section, 
player by player, as each one failed to perform a certain phrase in Debussy's 
"La Mer" to the famed Hungarian conductor's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Fritz Reiner was even worse," Weiss says. "This was a truly sadistic man. I'm 
convinced he would try to think up ways to humiliate the players." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss freely acknowledges that Szell and Reiner got phenomenal results from 
their unhappy bands. 
</P>
<P>
The late Herbert von Karajan was also well-known for his uncompromising 
attitude, both on the podium and off. 
</P>
<P>
Stutch vividly remembers a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony that he 
played under Karajan in 1958 in New York. "He definitely had a cool, detached 
presence on the podium," Stutch said. "It was the antithesis of Bernstein, who 
hugs and kisses and wants everyone to love him. With Karajan, there was no 
fraternizing. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet you knew you were in the presence of a giant. Such economy of motion, such 
command. You wanted to be enmeshed in this great musical mind." 
</P>
<P>
So if personal charm, baton technique and a way with words are not essential, 
what makes a great conductor? Weiss says it's an innate gift that is rare. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of young people are getting a chance to conduct who don't deserve to," 
he said. "There's a common misconception that if a person has enough experience 
on the podium, he's going to excel. It just doesn't happen. A conductor is 
trained in his own home, studying scores. 
</P>
<P>
"Most conducting courses are a waste of time. You really can't teach this art. 
The real talent is the ability to inspire -- to impart one's musical ideas to 
every musician in the orchestra in such a way that 
</P>
<P>
they play better than they thought they could . . . better than they can." 
</P>
<P>
The means by which this inspiration is imparted varies widely. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein sweats, swoons, cries and dances, Tanabe says. "It's a carnal 
experience. Part of his conviction is to call attention to himself. He never 
holds himself back. 
</P>
<P>
"To explain the feeling of buoyancy he wanted in a Beethoven symphony, he 
exploded in a series of belly laughs." 
</P>
<P>
Doriot Anthony Dwyer, since 1952 the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony, 
is still haunted by a glance she received from Bruno Walter more than 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At Tanglewood, we were (recently) playing Dvorak's New World Symphony, a piece 
we've done hundreds of times," Dwyer said. "There isn't a time we play it that 
I don't see Bruno Walter's face looking at me during the first big flute solo. 
It was such a beautiful expression. I knew exactly what he wanted. When the 
spirit of the music lights up a conductor's face before you play, there's 
nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
Recent Bowl guest Neeme Jarvi capitalizes on his physical stature, Markman 
said. "He has huge hands, he's a very large man, and he just envelops us with 
his interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"Erich Leinsdorf, a much smaller man, also does this beautifully. His hands, 
arms, head, body are all working together with such a strong sense of purpose. 
You feel like you're on Ninja at Magic Mountain. He's 
</P>
<P>
taking you away and there isn't any other way to go. You can't fight the 
G-force. For me, that makes playing in the orchestra very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Concept and heart are the most important conductorly qualities as far as 
Markman is concerned. "If the concept is deeply felt, and if a conductor has 
the ability to produce that concept in the orchestra, I'm willing to risk all 
to go with him." 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with an insight beyond the work itself," Tanabe said. "Way beyond 
the achievement of a good, technical performance. It's a gut-level emotion. The 
whole orchestra feels it. And we all hope it will happen."

SAMPLING: A CREATIVE TOOL OR LICENSE TO STEAL?;

What exactly is sampling? 
</P>
<P>
"A sample is a digital recording of a sound, 'an event,' " explained Barry 
Rudolph, a Los Angeles producer/recording engineer who writes for various music 
publications on technical aspects of the industry. "That event -- for example, 
hitting a snare drum -- is held in memory just like computer data." 
</P>
<P>
The sampler is a digital recorder that records sounds onto computer discs. But 
recording a sample isn't as simple as punching the record button on a regular 
tape recorder. The sampler must have the sound come through a power source like 
a mixing console; someone can't just sling a sampler over his or her shoulder, 
plug in a mike and record the sounds of the real world. 
</P>
<P>
For optimum sound quality, the pieces of old songs that are commonly used as 
samples should be recorded from CD on a DAT (Digital Audio Tape) recorder, 
played back in the studio and recorded by the sampler there. 
</P>
<P>
A sampler isn't like a regular recorder in another important respect -- it 
records digital information, not the sound itself. Someone can record music on 
one cassette recorder, pop the cassette tape into a different recorder and have 
the music play back immediately, but sampling doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sound a sampler will make," said Mike Leiner of West L.A. Music, "is 
if you drop it on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The information contained on the sample remains dormant until it is plugged 
into the array of hi-tech studio equipment that has revolutionized recording 
studios since the advent of the digital era 10 years ago. The key element is 
the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) system, which connects those 
instruments to one another and to the computers and software systems needed to 
"map out" the samples. 
</P>
<P>
One of these instruments is the sequencer, which functions as something of a 
traffic cop in the mapping-out process. The musician uses the sequencer to 
assign the various sampled sounds to various keys or sections of a keyboard 
instrument. Then the sounds can be played back, altered in whatever ways the 
musician or producer desires and recorded on to a master tape or 
direct-to-disc. 
</P>
<P>
"The sample is in a digital code and it can 
</P>
<P>
be manipulated just like any data," said Rudolph. "You can shorten or lengthen 
it, change the pitch and tonal characteristics, add or subtract sounds to it 
and replay it either like a keyboard synthesizer or have your computer 
sequencer play it." 
</P>
<P>
Sampling doesn't just involve recording pieces of old songs. Samples can be 
taken of a piece of dialogue from a TV program, a political speech, the crack 
of a baseball bat or a car braking at a stoplight. Sound-effects libraries in 
the motion picture industry are now increasingly composed of samples. The basic 
sounds found on the drum machines so prevalent in contemporary pop are samples. 
</P>
<P>
In studio session work, a complex backing vocal part can be recorded once, 
sampled and then inserted at the appropriate points later in the song. The 
length of an individual sample is in direct proportion to how much memory the 
sampler has and the bandwidth (the frequency) at which the sound is being 
sampled. It's highly variable, but musicians or producers generally can't 
sample for any great amount of time -- only 12 seconds of stereo sound at the 
currently accepted industry standard -- unless the amount of memory contained 
in the sampler has been augmented. 
</P>
<P>
That's why bass and drums -- rather than the more complex sounds of a lead 
guitar or saxophone -- are the easiest instruments to sample. Despite the 
limited time available on each disc, drum patterns and bass lines are 
frequently created by a technique known as "looping" -- taking one segment of a 
sample, joining the beginning of the phrase to the end and programming it to 
seamlessly repeat itself. It's impossible for someone to, say, record a few 
bars of Carlos Santana's guitar and be able to construct a reasonable facsimile 
of a Santana solo from that raw data. But the recorded drum sound of Phil 
Collins (a particularly popular sample a few years ago) or Led Zeppelin's John 
Bonham could become part of any musician's arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the sound palette that's available to you as a keyboard player, 
it opens up a tremendous spectrum," acknowledged Jeff Lorber, a keyboardist who 
is frequently called on to add musical tracks for dance remixes. Two 
briefcase-size equipment cases jammed with computer disks comprised his 
personal, portable library of samples at a recent remix session for Cheryl 
Lynn's "Every Time I Try to Say Goodbye." 
</P>
<P>
In the control room at Larrabee Sound Studio in West Hollywood, Lorber's 
fingers dexterously danced across the control keys of his Emulator II sampler 
as he recorded eight snippets of Lynn's vocals from the master tape. The title 
phrase of the song was one selection, but Lorber was searching for phrases that 
showed off the nuances and character in Lynn's voice -- like a low, throaty 
growl or the "Hey" and "Oh, no" ad libs that brought Aretha Franklin to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Lorber assigned each sample to a key on one of his keyboard 
instruments -- from then on, that particular vocal part would play whenever he 
pressed that key. He could affect the sound by the force and/or rhythm with 
which he touched the key or physically change the sound by redrawing the 
frequency wave with a light pencil on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
Now re-mix producer Keith Cohen and Lorber were armed with the option to 
strategically insert -- in industry parlance, "fly in" -- those vocal samples 
to add extra flavoring to the revamped Lynn track. Don SnowdenFO Jeff Lorber

upcoming tour, which is set to kick off on Aug. 16 in Atlantic City. Cher 
receives more, uh, exposure in the video for her current Top 40 hit "If I Could 
Turn Back Time," in which she parades around a battleship almost wearing a wisp 
of fabric that does little to cover a tattoo on her bottom. The provocative 
clip barely made it past the standards and practices people at NBC-TV's "Friday 
Night Videos," who reportedly deliberated for days before deciding that seeing 
another inch or two of Cher's body wouldn't unduly corrupt the nation's morals.

HOW ELLIS, GARY LARSON GOT TO 'DOGGIN' AROUND' COVER 
</P>

The Gary Larson/Herb Ellis connection isn't as far out as it seems. A few years 
ago, a friendship developed following a performance that Ellis gave at the Jazz 
Alley in Seattle. Larson, a Seattle resident and Ellis aficionado, is the 
cartoonist whose Far Side strip appears in more than 900 newspapers. He is also 
a guitarist who took one of Ellis' albums to the club for an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Larson is known as the creator of an absurdist, sometimes sinister world where 
animals do the unnatural, i.e. act like humans. A female moose, for example, in 
a slip and curlers, hands a phone to her husband, who's sitting in an easy 
chair, and says: "It's the call of the wild." 
</P>
<P>
Larson says he is inspired by listening to Ellis and a handful of other jazz 
musicians while he works. When the cartoon juices aren't flowing, he stops to 
strum for awhile, he has said. 
</P>
<P>
When Ellis asked Larson to design the "Doggin' Around" album cover, the 
cartoonist agreed on the following terms: payment could be rendered in the form 
of a $5-million check or a guitar lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis accepted the teaching gig. The 39-year-old cartoonist flew to Fairfield 
Bay, Ark., and the lesson turned into a three-day session with Ellis at his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Larson then designed the Herb Ellis and Red Mitchell album cover with typical 
flair. The guitarist and bassist are hound dogs, as are the club's customers 
being served by a poodle at tables with cards that read, "Please keep table 
barking to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Mutts are featured on a wall of fame. The lavatory is indicated by a fire 
hydrant symbol and a stuffed cat hangs in the far corner. On the back of the 
jacket, Larson writes: "Nothing gets my own juices going like the sounds 
(Ellis) and Red have turned out here." 
</P>
<P>
What's next for the odd couple? Ellis has told Carl Jefferson, president of 
Concord Records, the company that produced "Doggin' Around": "I asked him 
(Larson) to do a guest shot on my next album." 
</P>
<P>
On hiatus in New York after completion of his book, "The Prehistory of the Far 
Side," Larson is "seeking out good guitarists, meeting with them and playing 
with them," according to Concord Records' Merrilee Troost. Among those 
guitarists is Ellis, whose weeklong engagement at the Blue Note in Manhattan in 
June drew Larson there each night.

"Buster Checks His Bank Statement" might be a more appropriate title. This 
second album from the former New York Dolls frontman shticks to the same 
formula as his '87 debut: one part tropical-flavored punch-up ("All Night 
Party"), two parts vintage rhythm 'n' booze ("Who Threw the Whiskey in the 
Well?"), and two parts 100 proof aged in soul ("International Playboy"), topped 
with a pre-rock standard ("Deep in a Dream") and dollops o' dry humor. 
Nevertheless, this ice-breaking -- if scarcely ground-breaking -- disc is still 
a purr-fect poolside party platter for too-hepcats 'n' snake-hipped kittens as 
well as fine, fine, superfine grist for the live show's gin mill. DON WALLER

BOOK ACCELERATES THE DEBATE OVER TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County could raise enough money to relieve crowded freeways if motorists 
were charged "congestion fees" for commuting during peak traffic hours and if 
truck weight fees reflected road wear, according to UC Irvine economist Kenneth 
A. Small. 
</P>
<P>
Those and other theories about highway financing are contained in a new book in 
which Small and two East Coast economists argue that the nation's current 
system of highway financing is unable to cope with the real costs of 
maintaining and providing transportation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Road Work: A New Highway Pricing &amp; Investment Policy" was published last 
month by the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. It states that 
transportation experts have virtually given up on solving the highway mess 
because of the tremendous financial burden involved. The authors say that 
ride-sharing, parking fees and other such means to improve traffic flow are 
fine but that they will never allow the system to catch up with the pent-up 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
By making it more costly to motorists to jam existing roads, however, Small 
says, some of the existing license fees and road taxes could be retired. 
Car-pool lanes might not be needed because some commuters, rather than pay a 
congestion fee, would choose different work hours, travel by commuter trains or 
buses or find jobs closer to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Distinction' 
</P>
<P>
It is an idea that would be especially applicable in Orange County, Small said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"California has more congestion than most other states," he said. "And 
certainly Orange County has some distinction on that score." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Small -- who came to UC Irvine from Princeton University six years 
ago -- cites the planned 14-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway as an example of how 
a two-tier pricing system could work: Raising the price of a 50-cent toll to 85 
cents during peak traffic periods would reduce estimated peak traffic 19% in 
1995 and 30% by 2015, compared to the reductions that would result from a flat 
60-cent toll, "even though the two toll structures would have virtually 
identical impacts on total daily traffic." 
</P>
<P>
By charging congestion-based tolls of $1 to $2 per trip during peak hours, most 
states would be able to pay for major increases in highway capacity, Small 
says. Small would, however, limit the use of such funds to the particular area 
that was generating the toll revenue. "I wouldn't want to see congestion fees 
collected here be used for a new road way up in Eureka," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore, which charges a toll of about $2.50 per day to enter its central 
business district, achieved a 69% reduction in rush-hour traffic over a 
four-year period in the late 1970s, according to the book. Residents display 
monthly window stickers bought in advance to pass checkpoints along the main 
highways into the district, Small said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technology Has Advanced 
</P>
<P>
County tollway officials have not seriously considered higher prices for 
peak-hour use, Small said, because the tollway projects now under way are 
already heavily financed with developer fees. A congestion fee would be more 
practical, he said, if developers were not already footing up to 48.5% of the 
construction costs and if there was no possibility that the project could 
receive federal highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, county tollway chief John Meyer said he would recommend charging higher 
peak-hour tolls once the roads' traffic capacity is reached. 
</P>
<P>
The technology involved, Small argues, has advanced enough that queues at toll 
booths will not be a problem. Window stickers or license plates can be scanned 
electronically. Such a system is being proposed for Orange County's tollways. 
</P>
<P>
Small and co-authors Clifford Winston and Carol A. Evans acknowledge that there 
are many political obstacles to widespread implementation of their book's 
proposals, primarily because special interest groups have competing interests. 
</P>
<P>
The book's timing could not be better, though, Small says, partly because of 
the media's recent focus on the economic and social costs of traffic 
congestion. The book and its controversial policy proposals have already been 
discussed in several newspapers and magazines as well as on public television. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Book 
</P>
<P>
Its critics include former Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, a key 
member of the California Transportation Commission. Nestande, who is vice 
president of Arnel Development Co. in Costa Mesa, said he prefers car-pool 
lanes, flexible work hours and other such traffic mangement strategies, arguing 
that "congestion fees would be met with instant public outrage" and that doing 
much to adjust truck weight fees would be politically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
"Academicians can come up with good-sounding proposals that might even work, 
but I'm in favor of doing what's practical right now," Nestande said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McKean, Caltrans district director in Orange County, is mentioned in the 
book as a supporter of Small's congestion fee idea. In an interview, McKean 
said he would prefer to call the charge a "peak-hour users' fee" because that 
would generate less public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
McKean said he envisions annual vehicle registration cards that would be 
magnetically encoded by the Department of Motor Vehicles and displayed on the 
right side of the windshield. Every time the vehicle crossed into a peak-hour 
toll zone, a detector would record the registration code and a monthly bill 
would be mailed to the owner. Trucks, he said, would be charged higher 
peak-hour use fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Should Bear Costs 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that if people want to use the freeway, they should use it in 
the off-peak hours," McKean said. "But if they're going to use it in the peak 
hours, let's make them pay for it. Rather than tax all the people all the time, 
let's (tax) people who insist on peak-hour use for improving the flow out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission recently voted to try to secure 
state approval for at least one privately built and operated toll road -- 
possibly the extension of the Orange Freeway along the Santa Ana River. Small, 
however, says he is not in favor of "privatized" roads. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't trust government-granted franchise monopolies," he said. "They are 
subject to abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Small concedes that he himself may not have to pay many tolls: "I bicycle to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAYING FOR CONGESTION 
</P>
<P>
Here's how a congestion fee might work: 
</P>
<P>
Any road where traffic is a problem -- a downtown city thoroughfare, a highway 
or a toll road -- isdesignated as a congestion fee area. 
</P>
<P>
A driver entering such an area has a window sticker, card or license plate 
automatically readby an electronic scanner. 
</P>
<P>
The driver then is billed periodically, based on the information read by the 
scanner. 
</P>
<P>
The fee could be a set amount -- for example, $1 or $2. Or, in the case of a 
toll road, it wouldbe above the regular toll, for example, 85 cents rather than 
50 cents.

Dolphin Count -- Volunteers are needed for Saturday's "Day of the Dolphin" 
count along the Southern California coast. The Coast Dolphin Survey Project, 
headed by Dennis Kelly of Orange Coast College, hopes to station volunteers at 
one-mile intervals from Point Conception in Ventura County to the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people participated in the sixth such count in May, 1988. About 
120 bottlenosed dolphins were counted.

QUICK THINKING SAVED CREW OF CAPSIZED BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
It had been bright and calm, a marvelous day for sailing. Then the boat began 
to list, tipping over farther and farther until it capsized. 
</P>
<P>
That was the picture painted Saturday by Coast Guard officials who interviewed 
five crew members of the 66-foot sailboat Pandemonium, who were rescued at sea 
300 miles west of San Francisco on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The five arrived in Long Beach late Saturday, shaken but otherwise in good 
condition, Coast Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth Neely said. The crew members 
were Rick Carolus of Newport Beach, skipper John Frisch of Marina del Rey, 
Nancy David of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Graeme Gilchrist of Glasgow, Scotland, 
Grant Sennor, whose address is not known. The boat is owned by William Desmond 
of Los Altos Hills, who was not on board at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The boat was on its way back to the mainland after competing in the Transpac 
race, which departed Southern California for Hawaii in July. They had been on 
the return trip for 11 days and were a two-day sail away from San Francisco, 
their destination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions Were Ideal 
</P>
<P>
The crew had reported ideal conditions that afternoon, Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolus and David were on watch at just after 4 p.m. Thursday when the boat 
began to list. Because they believed the motion to be natural, they took no 
action right away, Neely said. By the time the sailors realized the boat was 
capsizing, it was too late. David and Carolus were able to jump into a life 
raft that automatically opened. The other three had been below deck and were 
trapped under water, along with the second life raft. 
</P>
<P>
Neely said that it was the crew's levelheadedness and some quick thinking by 
Frisch that saved them. 
</P>
<P>
Frisch dove under the boat and retrieved a flashlight, flares, life jackets and 
a knife, and he was also able to loosen the second life raft for the others to 
board. 
</P>
<P>
He activated an emergency radio signal, which was picked up by a commercial 
airline pilot who radioed authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard dispatched a C-130 cargo plane to the area, and the life rafts 
were spotted about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby merchant ship, the Green Ocean, which is registered in Panama, was 
enlisted to pick up the wet and weary crew about bout an hour later, Neely 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They all have a fair amount of sailing experience and said they didn't panic," 
she said. "When I asked them if the would continue sailing, they indicated it 
was just a freak accident and said yes." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication of how or why the keel came off, she said.

LOSS IS ENOUGH TO GIVE WITT FITS; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER ACE STRUGGLES AGAIN AS BREWERS BEAT ANGELS, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Witt continues to be the weak link in the Angels' strong-arm tactics this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lead the American League in earned-run average, despite the somewhat 
bloated 4.35 ERA put up by their onetime ace, who has allowed fewer than six 
hits in just one outing this year and is yielding an average of eight hits per 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Witt started again and another Angel winning streak ended when 
the Brewers slapped him around for 10 hits en route to a 5-2 victory in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who had won their previous three, have won 13 of their past 18 
games, and Witt has been the starting pitcher in three of the five losses. In 
fact, just about every time he gets a start these days, something bad happens . 
. . even when he pitches well. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous start, the bullpen blew a 5-0 lead to Seattle. The time before 
that, Oakland won, 9-5, and cut the Angels' lead in the American League West to 
one game. 
</P>
<P>
Two starts prior to that, Baltimore beat the Angels, 3-2, in 11 innings. 
Saturday night, the Angels lost, but managed to hang on to first place thanks 
to the Seattle Mariners, who beat the Athletics, 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
"If you pitch well most of the time, you're going to win often," Witt said. "If 
you pitch well two out of five times, you're not going to win too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw decent tonight. I had good stuff. But getting out of tough situations 
is part of this game and I had two tough situations and gave up two runs in 
each. So I don't think I pitched very well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Witt held the Brewers hitless in three of the six innings he pitched, but he 
gave up four hits and two runs in two others. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Rob Deer led off with a single and, one out later, Greg 
Brock doubled. Glenn Braggs and B.J. Surhoff followed with run-scoring singles 
and the Brewers had a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Yount and Brock singled to lead off the sixth. Then, with one out, 
Surhoff laid down a nice bunt on a squeeze play. But Witt made an acrobatic, 
sprawling snatch-and-toss to get Yount at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being buoyed by a fine defensive effort, Witt promptly surrendered a 
run-scoring single to Meyer on the next pitch. Bill Spiers followed with an 
RBI-double and Milwaukee went ahead, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the ballgame right there," Witt said. "If I get (Meyer) out, it's a 
2-1 game and who knows what happens after that. I don't want to downplay his 
hit, but I didn't exactly make a great pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've given up a lot of runs with two outs this season." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels didn't provide Witt (7-9) with much offense, scoring only on solo 
homers by Lance Parrish and Wally Joyner. And they squandered some early 
chances against Ted Higuera (7-4), who pitched his first complete game of the 
year and improved his record since the All-Star break to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to get him early," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "We could've 
had four or five runs early and that would have made a big difference. But we 
didn't do it and (Higuera) pitched very well after that. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give Teddy credit. He threw the ball over the plate and we made 
out. And when he started locating the ball, he got threw some innings without 
making a lot of pitches, which allowed him to finish strong." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels left runners in scoring position with less than one out in the 
first, second and third innings. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White singled to center and stole second in the first, but Johnny Ray 
flied out, Chili Davis struck out and Joyner flied out to the wall in right. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington followed Parrish's second-inning homer with a double to 
right, but Dick Schofield flied to center and Jack Howell lined out to right. 
</P>
<P>
And White walked leading off the third, eventually stealing his way around to 
third, before Joyner flied deep to right to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
So the Angels didn't capitalize on their chances and the Brewers made the most 
of theirs. But the Angels haven't risen to the top of the standings on 
explosive offense alone. They have a league-leading 15 shutouts and Witt has 
been involved in just one. And reliever Bob McClure got the victory that night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Mike made some tremendous pitches tonight," Rader said. "He had some 
really good innings. He makes a helluva play on the squeeze and then he makes 
that pitch to Meyer . . . you've got to make a quality pitch there." 
</P>
<P>
But Witt, the Angels' best-paid pitcher, just can't seem to make the right 
pitch at the right time these days. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish left Saturday night's game with contusions of the right 
knee and rib cage after a collision at home plate with Brewer left-fielder 
Glenn Braggs. Milwaukee had runners on first and second with two out in the 
second inning when designated hitter Joey Meyer hit a ground ball into the hole 
at shortstop. Dick Schofield ranged onto the grass to backhand the ball and 
Braggs apparently thought Schofield would attempt to get the slow-footed Meyer 
at first so he continued around third and headed home. Schofield's throw to 
Parrish was there in plenty of time, and the surprised Braggs didn't slide or 
try to run over Parrish. Instead, he sort of stumbled and dove headlong into 
Parrish. Parrish collapsed, but held onto the ball. "My knee's fine but my side 
is a little stiff," Parrish said. "I knew once the throw was coming he was set 
on contact so I just tried to hold on the ball. If wasn't a cheap shot. It's 
just part of the game." Parrish was examined by Brewer team physician Dr. Paul 
Jacobs and will be available on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
The slumping Brian Downing got his third day off in four games Saturday night 
and Devon White, who was out Friday night with a throat and sinus infection, 
was back in the lineup and hitting leadoff for the first time this season. 
"Brian volunteered to play yesterday because Devo was sick," Rader said, "but 
he has more trouble with left-handers than right-handers so it would have been 
a disservice to put him in there against (left-handed) Teddy Higuera. He just 
hasn't found stroke yet and the best thing to do is get away from it. More 
often than not, these things are more emotional than physical." . . . Catcher 
Bill Schroeder's five-year-old daughter, Lindsey, who had been hospitalized 
with an ear infection, returned home Saturday and Schroeder says he can finally 
get some sleep and enjoy baseball again. "She's much better now," he said. 
"It's a relief. Now, if I go 0 for 4, I'll give a (damn)." . . . A ball 
autographed by Jim Abbott went for $220 in a charity auction sponsored by the 
Brewer wives.

OLYMPIAN FEELS FORCED TO TAKE STEROIDS; 
</P>
<P>
SHOTPUTTER DOEHRING ADMITS HE USES THE DRUG TO STAY COMPETITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Doehring, a 1988 Olympic shotputter, is caught in a contradiction: He is 
concerned about the abuse of steroids but is not willing to give up his own use 
for fear of being left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Doehring admitted Friday that he has used steroids to help him remain a 
world-class track and field competitor, but he also said he wishes he didn't 
feel a need to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to do that (compete drug-free against drug-free opponents)," he said. 
"I know I can throw clean just as far as anyone can." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would consider taking the first step by giving up steroids, 
Doehring said: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then you'd throw 61 feet and everyone (would) think you're a loser." 
</P>
<P>
Doehring, who recorded a personal best of 70 feet 9 1/4 inches in June, will 
compete at Jack in the Box Invitational Sunday at UCLA, along with 1988 Olympic 
silver medalist Randy Barnes and Olympian Gregg Tafralis. 
</P>
<P>
Doehring said: "As far as I'm concerned, the human body has an ability to throw 
60-67 feet without steroids. Add steroids to that and you got guys going 75 
feet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say what the world record would be if they never came out with 
steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Ulf Timmermann of East Germany set the world outdoor record last year at 75-8. 
Barnes set the world indoor record in January at 74-4. 
</P>
<P>
Doehring said he believes it is impossible for an athlete to train -- and 
therefore compete -- at the current world-class level without 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids, a synthetic derivative of the male hormone testosterone, are 
used to enhance the growth of muscle tissue. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take shotputting, for instance," Doehring said. "(In training) you have 
to bench 500 pounds, and lift 700 pounds to (be able to put the shot) 75 feet. 
If you took 500 pounds and bench-pressed it without the sauce (steroids), you'd 
be sore for a month. Your muscles would be all bruised inside." 
</P>
<P>
Doehring, an alumnus of San Clemente High School and Saddleback College, 
believes The Athletics Congress' system of drug testing will never be 
sophisticated enough to catch most violators. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way that the testing is going to catch up to the athletes," said 
Doehring, a Fallbrook resident. "The athletes are too far ahead. They've got 
blocking agents, masking agents . . . you've got all kinds of things helping 
the athletes out. . . . I'd have to say everyone's using something and I'm not 
excluding myself from that. 
</P>
<P>
"The athletes will always be one step ahead until blood testing (is 
implemented)." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, TAC conducts its tests by urinalysis. Although blood testing is 
considered more absolute, it involves a lengthier and more expensive procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In March, TAC's board of directors unanimously approved a year-round, 
out-of-competition random drug-testing program for the top 25 athletes in each 
event. The testing is scheduled to begin Oct. 1. If an athlete tests positive 
for anabolic steroids or testosterone, the penalty is a two-year ban for the 
first offense and a lifetime ban for the second offense. 
</P>
<P>
Doehring said he is most concerned about athletes who try to gain an edge by 
experimenting with untested drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to take my body to that point where my body is at toxic levels, I'll 
quit. I'm not going to take toxic amounts, I'm doing the (same) things (that) 
hundreds of people have done. I'm not going to mix things, experiment, I'm just 
using safe amounts to enhance training and go to meets and throw. If I don't 
win, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) people will go to any resort (to get an edge). We'll have to draw the 
line when people start getting sick, start to die, get cancer . . . I wish they 
never invented steroids, as far as I'm concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to do other things instead: train better, lift better, eat better, 
sleep better, the way it used to be. I wish the sport would get cleaned up and 
that everyone can compete on a even level." 
</P>
<P>
But Doehring also believes track and field will lose its crowd appeal if 
athletes quit using performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a dying sport if they finally clear it up," he said. "You'll 
have guys running the 100 (meters) in 11 flat, throwing the javelin 220 feet, 
throwing (the shotput) 65 feet. Who's gonna come see that?" 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of the Jack in the Box meet are offering a $500,000 prize if one of 
the entrants in the long jump Sunday breaks Bob Beamon's 21-year-old world 
record of 29-2 1/2, and Doehring said that in itself tempts athletes to use 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"You're gonna get guys pumping themselves with everything to break that record, 
that's the sickening thing," Doehring said. "Of course, they'll be drug tested, 
but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Told of Doehring's comments, one of the meet's promoters, Don Franken, said 
athletes will be tested Sunday, but added: "Who knows? We just put on track 
meets. We don't know what people are using what. If you worry about those 
things all the time it takes the enjoyment out of it. . . . You can't speculate 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Doehring: "I don't want to sound too negative. Track and field is a great 
thing. It's been around forever. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, I'd love to see the thing cleaned up, then you will 
(compete) as equals. Then you're going to see great competitions."

THREE ORANGE COUNTY TRIATHLETES QUALIFY FOR THE WORLD MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Orange County triathletes have qualified for the World Triathlon 
Championships today 6at Avignon, France. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Jeter of Costa Mesa and George Wright of Los Alamitos qualified to join 
the United States National Team, or Team USA, in the 45-49 age group, and Bill 
Leach of Irvine qualified in the 40-44 age group. 
</P>
<P>
The competition will be at "international distances" -- a 1.5-kilometer swim, 
40K bicycle ride and a 10K run. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the World Triathlon Championships, athletes had to finish first 
or second in their respective age groups in triathlons at Dallas, Columbus, 
Ohio, or Chicago. Leach and Wright qualified at Dallas, and Jeter qualified at 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Jeter said many professional triathletes are not attending the championships 
because no appearance fees are being paid. However, professionals Mike Pigg, 
the Triathlete Magazine's Triathlete of the Year in 1988, and Mark Allen, 
Triathlete of the Year in 1986 and 1987, will be there.

SURFING AT HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
THOMAS TRIPS ANOTHER FAVORITE; 
</P>
<P>
HE MEETS THREE-TIME CHAMPION CURREN IN SEMIFINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Thomas continued to glide over the Huntington Beach surf as well as the 
top seeds Saturday at the Op Pro Surfing Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who is seeded 12th, pulled his second upset in a row with a 69 to 68.5 
quarterfinal victory against fourth-seeded Martin Potter of England, the 
current world-tour points leader. Thomas upset fifth-seeded Tom Carroll of 
Australia in Friday's third round. 
</P>
<P>
He will meet defending Op Pro champion Tom Curren in the semifinals at 8 a.m. 
today. The finals are scheduled for 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Curren, who is from Santa Barbara but has lived in France for the past five 
months, advanced with an 81.0 to 72.5 victory against Mike Parsons of Laguna 
Beach. Richie Collins of Newport Beach and Sunny Garcia of Waianae, Hawaii, 
will meet in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The semifinal matchup with Curren, a two-time world champion aiming for his 
fourth Op Pro title, will give Thomas a chance for revenge. Curren won their 
only other meeting a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to surf really well," said Thomas, who is from Sunset Beach, 
Hawaii. "He's the best surfer in the world in my opinion. I really have nothing 
to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a dream come true to take down Tom Curren at the Op Pro." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas held off Potter in the closing seconds to earn one of the closest 
victories so far at the championships. He led by only three-tenths of a point 
when Potter caught a wave with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Judges add the scores of the top four waves to determine a surfer's overall 
total. 
</P>
<P>
Potter scored 13.8 out of a possible 30 points, but it wasn't enough to improve 
his overall score. Thomas picked up a wave just before the final horn, scoring 
a 10.5 and erasing an earlier score of 10.3 to increase his lead by two-tenths. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about holding him off the (first) wave because I had priority," 
Thomas said. "It was a tough move. If I would have taken the first wave and 
slipped up, then he could have had the second one. Fortunately, we both caught 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he had to keep his composure in the final minute. He knew the 
competition was close because he listened to the scores over the public-address 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I get that kind of composure from golf," said Thomas, who has an 18 handicap. 
"If I fluff one shot, I can always make the next one. Surfing is all about 
holding your composure. That was a strong force in my success last year on the 
tour." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 21, jumped from 44th on the tour in 1987 to 12th last year. A four-year 
pro, he hopes he can get his first victory on the tour at the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fifth at the Op last year," he said. "I've always done well at events in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
So has Garcia, who beat Rob Bain of Australia, 85.1 to 82.6, in the 
quarterfinals. Bain's elimination marked only the fourth time an Australian 
hasn't reached the semifinal of an Assn. of Surfing Professionals event. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have lost, everyone would have remembered me as the guy who was 
bumped out by the Australian," Garcia said. "It was a make-or-break heat." 
</P>
<P>
Collins defeated Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach, 90.5 to 65, to make his first 
semifinal appearance at the Op Pro. Collins said he has used the Op Pro to 
experiment with new maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing all different kinds," he said. "I started copying Potter 
because he's been winning. I've changed my style a lot in the last eight weeks. 
I'm getting more comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he and Collins have similar styles, which should make the semifinal 
interesting. 
</P>
