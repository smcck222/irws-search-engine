RADIATION FOR THE AVERAGE LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
NUCLEAR WASTE: DEREGULATION BY THE NRC COULD OPEN VIRTUALLY EVERY AMERICAN SITE 
TO LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE MILLER, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) is a senior member of the 
House Interior Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently buoyed by the success of the deregulated savings and loan industry, 
the Bush Administration has just opened the door to deregulation of nuclear 
waste. This policy is not only potentially threatening to the public health, 
but it is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has announced that it will allow disposal of 
some "low-level" nuclear waste along with common household garbage in ordinary 
landfills. This defies common sense. It also represents a historic and 
unwarranted reversal of current policy, which requires the use of licensed 
low-level radioactive waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC commissioners who proposed the change argue that deregulating low-level 
nuclear waste will free the agency's overworked staff to better regulate "real 
problems," such as more dangerous radioactive waste and nuclear plant 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of receding from its responsibilities, the NRC should better 
utilize its ample resources to regulate the nuclear industry. Given the already 
low credibility of the industry, discarding the NRC's responsibility to monitor 
low-level radioactive waste will further undermine its image. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC policy is in conflict with the opinions of many scientists, who believe 
that low-level radiation may pose a greater threat to public health than 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended 
that radiation-exposure limits for workers be cut by more than 50%. And in 
December, 1989, a panel of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences 
concluded that the risk of developing cancer after exposure to low levels of 
radiation is three to four times higher than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
The new NRC policy would permit an unlimited number of exemptions as long as 
the total exposure to an individual from all exemptions is less than 100 
millirems per year. Deregulating low-level nuclear waste could increase 
exposure to radiation by as much as 25% for some people. The NRC argues that 
the increased exposure is acceptable because it is smaller than the 360 
millirems that the average American receives every year from background 
radiation and radon gas. The NRC neglects to mention that radon exposure alone 
causes lung cancer in up to 20,000 Americans every year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the NRC policy argue that deregulating nuclear waste would reduce 
the American nuclear industry's radioactive waste disposal bill by as much as 
$35 million per year by exempting up to one-third of the radioactive wastes 
from nuclear plants from current regulation. 
</P>
<P>
But is it rational to turn virtually every landfill in the country into a 
potential, unregulated radioactive waste dump to save money? And even if there 
is some level at which radioactive waste is not hazardous, it would be very 
difficult to ensure that unscrupulous operators do not try to save even more 
money by putting extremely dangerous waste in the local dump rather than in a 
licensed repository. The policy is also troublesome because it could exempt a 
large volume of presently hazardous waste from cleanup at radiation sites, like 
decommissioned nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
Even more disturbing, the NRC deregulation policy would permit higher radiation 
exposure than similar policies proposed by our Environmental Protection Agency, 
Great Britain, Canada, Japan and Finland. The NRC policy is also inconsistent 
with recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the National 
Council on Radiation Protection. Furthermore, the NRC is pursuing this policy 
over the objections of its own experts. 
</P>
<P>
As further justification, the NRC points to similar exemptions allowed for 
medical technologies, such as X-rays. But the NRC fails to understand that the 
public supports the use of radiation for medical purposes because it saves 
lives. There is no such benefit from the deregulation of nuclear waste, In 
fact, the policy could cause additional cancer deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a number of states and locales have passed laws banning the disposal 
of radioactive waste in ordinary landfills. It seems likely that more 
communities will pass such restrictions if the NRC continues to insist on its 
nuclear-deregulation effort despite the hostility of the public and the 
skepticism of industry. Unfortunately, under current law, the NRC has the power 
to force states to accept its policy. 
</P>
<P>
If the NRC continues to pursue this misguided policy, Congress should, at a 
minimum, remove the NRC's authority to impose it on the states.

CAMBODIAN SURVIVORS OF HORRORS IN THEIR HOMELAND FIND THAT IN AMERICA THE RULES 
ARE HARD TO FOLLOW.

<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman, a writer in San Diego, was in Cambodia 
and Vietnam last winter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Samrang Suon steps past the gate of a Buddhist temple in East San Diego, the 
diminutive Cambodian refugee passes an invisible boundary of danger. She is no 
longer aware of the menacing men standing in a knot across the street, or the 
gang graffiti on nearby walls, or the Mexican ranchero music wailing down the 
block. A screen door leads her through a dark entryway to a large, cool, prayer 
room smelling of incense. Woven floor mats stream with light from glass doors 
reflecting a jungle-like garden. A larger-than-life Buddha image sits on an 
altar strewn with plastic flowers. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75,000 Cambodians live in Southern California, congregating in Khmer 
communities in Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego. For many of them, the 
temple is a refuge of peace from gang wars, incomprehensible rules, bus routes 
and nightmares of Pol Pot. 
</P>
<P>
On this peaceful afternoon, there is news that America has changed its Cambodia 
policy; the United States is withdrawing recognition from a resistance 
coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge and opening dialogue with Vietnam on 
Cambodia's future. For a moment, Samrang, 31, is whiplashed back in time. 
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1975, when the U.S.-backed Lol Nol regime fled Phnom Penh and the 
Khmer Rouge took over, all normal life halted in Cambodia. Black-clad 
guerrillas ordered everyone in Phnom Penh to leave their homes for a few days 
so they could "clean up" the capital. Samrang, then 15, believed peace finally 
had come to Cambodia. She packed a change of clothes in her school bag and set 
off, with 11 other people in her family, into the river of humanity clogging 
the streets. They pushed their car piled like an oxcart with bags of rice until 
the Khmer Rouge barred the road. They watched helplessly while the guerrillas 
cut off the tires to make rubber-soled sandals. Mobbed by a "sea of black 
hair," Samrang was force-marched barefoot into the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Reaksmey Mom, also 15 at the time, was staying with her aunt in another part of 
Phnom Penh when the Khmer Rouge came. She tried frantically to join her parents 
and siblings, but a guard turned her away. The first night, there was no wood 
to make a fire, so the grandparents burned paper money to boil rice. A body was 
floating in the temple pond where they drank. 
</P>
<P>
The urban populace was driven back to the Year Zero. Pol Pot was wiping the 
slate clean and beginning history again. He had monumental visions of 
rebuilding the country -- dams, dikes, farms, roads -- entirely by hand, by the 
labor of the despised "elite," the city people, artists, teachers, monks, 
doctors, children and elderly. The Communist system, personified by the 
terrifying Angka guards, ruled absolutely, and infractions were punished by 
torture and execution. Samrang's father grew too ill to work, and she watched 
her parents starve to death. Her 11-year-old brother stole a fish net to try to 
feed them; he was caught, and the Angka kicked him until he could not get up 
and his body "swelled in death." 
</P>
<P>
Reaksmey's grandparents also died of starvation. She watched in horror as her 
cousin was raped by five Angka, who then sawed her skin with serrated palm 
leaves and left her to die. When her baby nephew cried for his mother, he was 
bayoneted. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1 million and 2 million people were consumed by the genocide in 
Cambodia's countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese invaded in 1979, driving Pol Pot from power. Fearful of their 
"rescuers," too, the survivors of "the killing fields" fled to Thailand. From 
there, thousands were fast-forwarded to post-modern America. Among them were 
Samrang and Reaksmey. 
</P>
<P>
"This is heaven country," Reaksmey thought when she arrived in America. "But 
next day I feel discouraged. A strange new world, I don't know what's gonna 
happen." Reaksmey was given $3 pocket money and sent to live in a largely black 
housing project in Texas. The only black people she had seen before were Cuban 
Communists in Cambodia. An air conditioner had been removed from the bedroom, 
leaving a gaping hole in the wall, and Reaksmey spent her first night in 
America crouching with a knife to protect herself from imagined intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Some Cambodians, like Samrang and Reaksmey, adapted well to the American dream 
of independence. Both have worked as translators in a counseling center at the 
Union of Pan Asian Communities in San Diego. But a 1988 study by two San Diego 
State sociologists, Ruben Rumbaut and Kenji Ima, reveals that Cambodians 
generally have fared worse than other Asian immigrants. Cambodians have a 
higher percentage of single-parent families headed by women, frequently widows 
of the genocide. And they have a higher rate of depression. 
</P>
<P>
Families that held together to survive the killing fields have broken apart in 
the social freedom of America. In the mental-health clinic, Reaksmey saw the 
family breakdown close-up. "Parents can't control children," she says. "Fathers 
don't have job. They feel shame. They lost their pride. Wife does not respect 
them. Many family end up fighting with each other. Children come under peer 
pressure, cut school, take drugs, join gang. This country is too much freedom 
for children." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, it is hardest for people who lost their children in Cambodia. 
They have no future. 
</P>
<P>
"We are alive in our bodies," says a widow. "But our hearts and minds are dead 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the temple, four families share a four-bedroom rental house. The 
living room is swept clean and all furniture except a couch has been removed. A 
large color television is raised on a kind of altar, beneath pictures of Pope 
John Paul II and Buddha. The TV is on, and a young Khmer girl is dancing on the 
screen, her hands molded in gestures that were captured in stone a thousand 
years ago in the relief carvings of Angkor Wat. 
</P>
<P>
At midday on a working day, the men bend idly over a board game. They are 
able-bodied, and at first glance they appear to be perfect material for a 
Ronald Reagan anecdote on the evils of welfare. Only in conversation can one 
see the crippling fear in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is really hard here," says a client back at the mental-health center. "No 
river to drink water. No light if you don't pay. In Cambodia, at least you can 
pick fruit from the jungle and grow rice. In America everything you do costs 
money, and you have to drive a car everywhere and the rules are hard to 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
"It's America's fault, pardon my words," says Samrang. "In this country, you 
make it too easy not to work. These men want to work, but if they do, they lose 
their health insurance. They get sick and lose their job. Why work when they 
can lose everything?" 
</P>
<P>
Many men in the group home dream of returning to their country and wonder if 
Bush's policy will bring peace. They ask: What are conditions like in Phnom 
Penh? Is it safe? Are the Khmer Rouge still attacking the city? Who will win, 
Pol Pot or Premier Hun Sen? 
</P>
<P>
They are divided politically, with some supporting the Hun Sen regime, others 
Prince Sihanouk, and one asking for an international custodianship to rebuild 
the country. But they all assent to one message: "No Pol Pot army. No Pol Pot 
party. Tell George Bush to have a peaceful Cambodia with elections." Their 
faith that, somehow, America could make everything right in Phnom Penh 
contradicts the fact that, until recently, America supported Khmer Rouge 
representation in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Blocking out painful realities is a survival tool. For some, numbness has 
become crippling. In a therapy group, three men and two women suffering 
depression try to confront their own pasts. It is difficult for them to open 
up. Speaking in Cambodian, their voices need no translation. Their upper lips 
quiver, eyes go out of focus, voices tremble as they recount their stories. 
Among five survivors, 26 deaths are recounted in one hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Angka kill my husband and starve my children," says one woman. Angka is never 
personalized. It is the abstract term for the perpetrators of genocide. "Some 
Angka live in Long Beach," she claims, hidden in the Cambodian community of 
45,000 there. 
</P>
<P>
Chillingly, Cambodia's Hitler also lives: Somewhere along the Thai border, Pol 
Pot hides out with his army, still the strongest rebel force in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The civil war is not over in Cambodia -- or in America. Age-old rivalries among 
Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand are mirrored in violence between refugee 
youth gangs here. In San Diego, the friction caused the Cambodian New Year's 
celebration to be cancelled. This spring, two Cambodian youths were shot to 
death near a San Diego freeway by a suspected rival Asian gang. The father of 
one victim moved away, overwhelmed by the irony of losing a child to violence 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
The shadow of death follows Cambodians wherever they go. Last year, it came 
alive to Reaksmey in a letter from her only surviving sister. She learned that 
in 1975 her father, a former government official, was hacked into three pieces, 
her mother and little sister dragged from a hospital and killed, her brother 
disemboweled. "I used to live to see my parents' face," she says, "now I live 
for my two daughters." 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly in control, Reaksmey murmurs: "I feel like a drop of water in a lotus 
leaf. It can roll out any time." 
</P>
<P>
Within the walls of the Buddhist sanctuary, sipping Coca-Cola beside a 
saffron-robed monk, the Cambodians seem to be at peace. But beyond the gates 
lie unimaginable fears. "Angka" lives. 
</P>
<P>
Cambodia doesn't need just a political settlement. It needs psychological 
healing.

<P>
The fight over the district map for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
represented politics at its most arrogant. Of course, the big story is that 
blacks and Latinos finally have a chance of getting elected to the board, 
thanks to a federal judge's findings that the present district lines are 
discriminatory. But there's another, less obvious story here, about political 
contempt -- about how far some elected officials will go to retain power, and 
how free they feel of the obligation to be accountable. The supervisors not 
only attempted to keep the five districts as white as possible; above all else, 
they attempted to keep their districts theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department stemmed from the incumbents' 
desire to protect themselves politically. Their drawing of district lines was 
probably not motivated by a wish to keep any minority group subjugated. More 
likely, the lines were drawn to dilute the voting strength of Latinos because 
the supervisors knew that otherwise their days in office were numbered. 
Self-preservation was their concern; they were indifferent to the consequences 
for voters. 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon wrote in his initial decision that the 
present lines are illegal: "During the 1981 redistricting process, the 
supervisors' primary objective was to protect their incumbencies and that of 
their allies. This objective, however, was inescapably linked to the continued 
fragmentation of the Hispanic population core." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most arrogant of all was the new plan submitted to Kenyon, which he 
rejected last week. Instead he chose a plan similar to that offered by the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had warned that he would become involved in the map himself if the 
the board's revision was unsatisfactory. Despite this, Supervisors Deane Dana 
and Mike Antonovich, along with Supervisor Pete Schabarum (who is not seeking 
reelection but provides the third vote for the Republican majority) approved 
and submitted a plan that was little more than a political attack on Supervisor 
Edmund Edelman. A predominantly Latino district was created, but Edelman was 
moved into it, thus jeopardizing his future on the board. The plan also diluted 
the strength of black voters by combining in one district South-Central Los 
Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently was like a game to the Republican majority. It was no surprise 
when Kenyon rejected their scheme, calling it a "nonsensical distortion" of the 
districts and "not the result of a good-faith attempt by responsible 
legislators to comply with the court's" order to correct the voting-rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican majority still appears resolute. Dana said, when Kenyon rejected 
the board's map, that he was confident the decision would be overturned on 
appeal. Schabarum said that it was "consistent with the lack of objectivity 
Judge Kenyon has displayed during the entire trial." Antonovich quipped that 
the plaintiffs and Kenyon were "trying to draw a district in the shape of a 
donkey." Perhaps they preferred the shape of a donkey to the shape of a 
jackass. 
</P>
<P>
Only Dana's and Antonovich's interests are served by defending the current 
lines and appealing Kenyon's decision. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn estimates that 
the County has spent between $4 million and $6 million litigating the case and 
may face another $2 million if the county is ordered to pay the plaintiffs' 
legal fees. An appeal would only waste more money. And all to protect three 
Republican political bases, in a county where vital public services are being 
scaled back for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kenyon's decision should not be appealed. The supervisors should be 
reminded that a seat on the board is not a birthright. The majority's arrogant 
maneuvering to stay in power under any circumstances should be rewarded by 
rejection at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
It is more than ironic that Kenyon -- a federal judge, appointed for life and 
not answerable to the voters -- must step in to protect voters from elected 
officials. When politicians have lost all sense of accountability, and act only 
with their own selfish interests in mind, they have outlived their political 
usefulness and should be replaced.

U.S. TEXTILE POLICY IS NO BARGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
HOW A CRAZY QUILT OF PROTECTIONIST LAWS DRIVES UP THE PRICE OF CLOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again ugly protectionist sentiments that could wreck attempts to put new 
order to world trade are emerging in Washington. If myopic legislators have 
their way, consumers will wind up paying more for clothes and shoes while U.S. 
textile and apparel makers will get fat, happy and complacent because of less 
competition from imports. 
</P>
<P>
That's unfair, uncompetitive and unrealistic given today's global marketplace. 
Nevertheless, the House is expected to pass a textile bill that would further 
restrict imports of textiles, apparel and footwear. The Senate already has 
overwhelmingly approved a similar measure that would limit the growth of such 
imports to 1% a year. The Bush Administration has threatened to veto the 
ill-conceived bill -- and rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators are alarmingly persistent when it comes to protecting textile and 
apparel makers. Two earlier textile bills were killed by presidential vetoes. 
The textile and apparel industries already are heavily protected by 1,000 
quotas established under 38 bilateral agreements and negotiated under the 
international Multifiber Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The new bill not only would abrogate these agreements but would jeopardize the 
current international trade talks where the Bush Administration has proposed 
global textile quotas. The plan would phase down the hodgepodge of current 
quotas over a 10-year period to allow adequate transition time to more normal 
textiles- and apparel-trading arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Notably, the American Apparel Manufacturers Assn. is backing the 
Administration. And its neutral stance on the textile bill is a big departure 
from its usual knee-jerk support of U.S. textile interests. Perhaps apparel 
makers see the potential in opening more overseas markets: U.S. clothing 
exports rose 38% in 1989 and were up 22% in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to justify expanded protection for the textile industry. Mills are 
operating at a better utilization rate than the U.S. manufacturing sector as a 
whole, and shipments are up. Unemployment in the major textile states has been 
generally lower than the national unemployment average. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, consumers would wind up paying the costs of the textile bill -- 
$160 billion in the first five years. Current quotas and tariffs, for example, 
already add $2,100 to the annual clothing costs of a family of four. That would 
rise to $2,600 in five years under the bill. Low-income shoppers would suffer 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
California would, too. If our trading partners import less cotton (the state's 
No. 1 agricultural export) because we won't take their finished cloth products, 
fewer goods are likely to wend through the ports of Los Angeles, where the 
garment center is second only to New York. The textile bill is a no-win 
proposition. The House should dump it.

RTD TO OFFER FREE RIDES ON TARDY BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patsaouras has got to be kidding. He wants to speed up the bus service by 
offering free rides if the bus is behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
How many of us have been rudely and dangerously shoved aside by a 
smoke-belching RTD bus controlled by an egotistical maniac? 
</P>
<P>
What I foresee evolving from this dumb idea is a madhouse competition among bus 
drivers for their share of the glory. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the other board members have retained their senses and realize that 
things are out of control in Los Angeles. No half-baked promise will change the 
traffic conditions on our city streets. No half-baked promise will solve the 
RTD's credibility problem.

RTD TO OFFER FREE RIDES ON TARDY BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "RTD to Try a Novel Lure: A Free Ride if Bus Is Late," July 26: 
</P>
<P>
Anger is the only way to express my feelings about this article. Anyone who has 
to take his or her car into the dealership for repair and dares to try a ride 
back to the office or home on an RTD bus -- or a Santa Monica Blue Bus -- is 
going to run into frustration: At most bus stops, you find absolutely no 
information about the buses, where they go, and when they arrive. You would 
have to make a trip to the public library first and do some research about the 
bus lines in the area, because the phone numbers are busy most of the time, the 
drivers are too busy and oftentimes no help at all; if you need a transfer to a 
different bus line to get to your final destination, that means instant 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Lateness is a problem too, but, of course, if you want to be fair, you cannot 
always blame the drivers or the company if buses get stuck in Los Angeles' 
chaotic traffic. No matter how you cut it, anyone who has to work for a living 
simply cannot afford to waste time playing the RTD game, unless he or she takes 
the same bus line every day, is extremely familiar with the system and can risk 
arriving late -- 15 to 20 minutes or more. In European cities, where public 
transportation is much more common, you find information about times and routes 
at each and every bus stop! Why not in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, RTD might even be dangerous to your well-being or even your life 
after dark. Unfortunately, the only thing you can do in this city to ensure 
your personal safety and punctuality is ignore the urge to use buses and get 
yourself into a car or at least a taxi wherever you go. 
</P>
<P>
If RTD Board President Nick Patsaouras wants to know why daily ridership has 
fallen from 1.8 million passengers to 1.3 million in the last five years, there 
is only one question to ask: "Have you ridden a bus lately?"

IRAQI FORCES OVERRUN TINY KUWAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're right. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait should and hopefully will serve as a 
reminder to Americans that we are much too dependent upon oil -- foreign or 
otherwise (editorial, "Is Anyone Really Safe," Aug. 3). 
</P>
<P>
However, the simplest, most effective and immediate response would be to 
"detox" ourselves from "fossilized" methods of transportation. Stop buying gas. 
Make it patriotic to cut our gas consumption. Make it illegal to drive solo. 
Forget the freeway part of the new gas tax and put it all to mass transit -- 
only these kinds of measures will flatten Iraq President Saddam Hussein's 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
Don't waste time stuck in beltway gridlock. Don't wait for the President; the 
Bush reelection pump is partially primed by oil, and will likely not take 
meaningful action. So let's rally 'round something besides the gas pump this 
go-round. How 'bout, "Uncle Sam Wants You -- to Take the Bus or the Blue"?

<P>
The tremendous bellows of outrage by George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and other 
leaders against Iraq's seizure of Kuwait should not be allowed to obscure the 
less virtuous realities of the situation. It was in fact an initiative by the 
United States that emboldened President Saddam Hussein to march his troops 
south. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Iraq has restrained from such adventures out of fear of 
intervention by Iran. But Iran is now sidelined, finally forced to sue for 
peace in its eight-year war with Iraq, in part because the United States 
provided naval escorts for tankers in the Persian Gulf, which had the effect of 
aiding Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. strategists spent the end of the 1970s and most of the '80s seeing Iran as 
the rogue power in the area. Along with Britain, the United States tilted to 
Iraq as the necessary counterweight to Iran's fervid rhetoric against Saudi 
Arabia and the Emirates. As so often in the past, these strategists were 
fighting every war except the one that finally took place. Now Iraq has done 
exactly what was feared of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
If President Bush's outrage sounds hypocritical to some, including the vast 
majority of Latin American leaders who saw his invasion of Panama as equally 
illegal and outrageous, it might also seem a little ungrateful. A sharp rise in 
world oil prices will no doubt come as a boon to the President's cronies in the 
Oil Patch and may even be reflected in a revival in the housing market in the 
oil states. 
</P>
<P>
For Prime Minister Thatcher, who spent most of last week reading the 
Confederation of British Industries' predictions of impending recession, the 
oil-price rise comes as manna from heaven. Britain's revenues from its North 
Sea oil will now soar and help stave off economic downturn before the next 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of sanctions -- primarily in the form of an embargo on oil -- could 
possibly have teeth, but Iraq withstood equally savage pressures in its war 
against Iran. Iraq is broke already, having about $15 billion in debts (a 
realistic Western estimate) after its long war, and could suggest to its 
creditors that they talk to Washington and other sponsors of any punitive 
economic sanctions. The reason Iraq invaded was that Kuwait's overproduction of 
oil, in breach of OPEC guidelines, was -- according to President Saddam Hussein 
-- costing his country $1 billion for every dollar that Kuwait's overproduction 
knocked off the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Against Iraq's large and battle-hardened army and considerable air power, it 
seems unlikely that anyone will mount military sanctions, even though a "Bush 
Doctrine" will no doubt now come yapping along the tracks of the old Carter 
Doctrine, which used strong language about American resolve to respond if it 
felt its interests in the Middle East to be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Now that they are being threatened, the most imposing artillery barrages will 
probably be unleashed on Capitol Hill, in rhetoric by Pentagon officials before 
the relevant committees. We may confidently await a tsunami of verbiage about 
the need for long-range transports, stand-off anti-tank weapons, air-to-air 
missiles and bombers allegedly able to penetrate "sophisticated" defenses -- 
i.e. the Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to feel much sympathy for Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, the emir of 
Kuwait, who had a pretty good run for his money. In comfortable exile, he will 
no doubt rue his errors: thinking that Hussein was bluffing; failing to see, at 
the climactic meeting of the OPEC countries in Geneva in July, that Iran and 
Saudi Arabia were siding with Iraq against Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest failure, as usual, was that of the intelligence services and of 
the journalists who consort with them. The United States was hailing the 
therapeutic properties of dialogue only hours before Iraqi tanks rolled across 
Kuwait's border. Britain was caught equally off-balance. Its current ambassador 
to Baghdad, Harold (Hooky) Walker, was on holiday in Woking. The head of 
Israeli military intelligence was celebrating at his own wedding. It would be 
too cynical to conjecture that the United States actually gave Hussein a tacit 
go-ahead, as it did before he started his war against Iran. Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush and the talk-tough crowd made a staggering miscalculation. They 
beefed up Iraq to stop Khomeini's fanatic hordes, and now have the 
mortification of seeing a brilliant coup by the very watchdog they had favored. 
The unexpected was bound to befall those who complacently thought that because 
the Soviet Union has bowed out of the Cold War, the world can hold no ugly 
surprises.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO;

THE VOTE IS PRI PROPERTY NO MORE;

FOR ELECTIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time seems to be running out for the old political ways of Mexico. A few weeks 
ago President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed a commission of impeccable 
individuals to monitor human-rights violations in an effort to clamp down, once 
and for all, on all abuses, whether by private groups or public agencies. Then, 
congress passed a new electoral law that eliminates all the devious instruments 
through which the government party, PRI, used to rig elections. If those 
developments mark the arrival of a new political system, the challenge will be 
to build a modern structure to give it life. 
</P>
<P>
Given the size of Mexico, human-rights violations have been relatively few, but 
nonetheless serious, in recent years. Police and government officials, 
particularly at the state and local levels, have killed dissidents and 
threatened whomever they deemed stood in the way of their pursuits. The drug 
war has not helped; both the drug gangs and the police have never bothered to 
consider whether, in their zeal to catch or escape one another, they were 
killing or harming peaceful, ordinary citizens. Worst of all, many of those 
abuses have been condoned or otherwise hidden by the very authorities that 
should have been prosecuting those responsible for them. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the style of the Salinas administration, the government response was 
neither shy nor complacent. Rather than simply solving the one or two cases 
that have attracted particularly strident public opinion, the president went 
all the way to create a commission that has no legal hindrances to carrying out 
any investigation. And its members could not have been better chosen. Among 
them is a former rector of the National University, the rector of the Jesuit 
university in Mexico City, the publisher of the left-leaning daily La Jornada, 
the publisher of the independent daily El Norte of Monterrey, a world-renowned 
novelist, the editor of the monthly magazine Nexos, and so on. The quality of 
the commission members guarantees, if nothing else, that they are not going to 
shy away from anything; each and every member stands to lose more by attempting 
to side with the government than by denouncing it. 
</P>
<P>
In the realm of elections, there had been so many instances of rigging in the 
past 50 years that elections no longer fulfilled the democratic role of 
conferring legitimacy on the political system. Since the PRI (Institutional 
Revolutionary Party) had never been seriously challenged in any national 
election, electoral fraud had been largely a local issue. That changed in 1988 
when the PRI experienced real competition in a federal election. Though 
accusations of fraud can easily be pushed too far, particularly when the 
accusers are all former PRI members, well-versed in the art of political 
manipulation, those elections showed the limits of an electoral (and political) 
system that is perceived as based on electoral fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, Salinas went for consensus rather than a quick fix. The PRI was the 
the only party to introduce a bill for a new electoral law. Most of the other 
parties rejected the bill as presented because it still gave the PRI control of 
every aspect of the electoral process. Passing the law required only a simple 
majority in congress, which the PRI controls; yet it was obvious that unless 
the bill passed and became law by a clear majority, it would not enjoy the 
credibility that the electoral system demands. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the PRI began to negotiate even with the most radical opposition. By the 
end of the congressional term, literally at midnight of the last day, the PRI 
had conceded the most fundamental strongholds of electoral control: Voters will 
have to present a registration card with picture; preliminary election results 
will be announced the same day, as opposed to waiting a week for the official 
results; the entity responsible for certifying the results will not be skewed 
in favor of the PRI by the presence and votes of government people; all parties 
will share equally in the nomination and selection of electoral supervisors, 
and so on. The law passed with 365 votes, more than 100 of those from the 
opposition. Thus ended the PRI's power to manage the vote as if it were a 
private club. 
</P>
<P>
These two actions show a clear line of departure from the good old days of easy 
PRI rule. Most important, however, they demonstrate a clear understanding by 
the administration that it is impossible to be successful in the new era of 
economic competition and involvement with the rest of the world if Mexico's 
political house is not kept in perfect order. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the new constraints in both the electoral and human-rights realms will 
not be swallowed easily by the traditional PRI strongholds. These, the net 
losers in the new era, will make every attempt to hold on to their old 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this context that the Salinas government's political courage becomes 
so much more relevant. Reforming a nation and bringing it out of 50 years of 
morass is one tough job.

THE EPITOME OF RACIST THINKING; 
</P>
<P>
REP. STARK TEACHES THAT THE WAY TO MEET DISSENT IS WITH DESTRUCTION OF THE 
DISSENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE FEIN, Bruce Fein is a constitutional scholar in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Thursday, Rep. Pete Stark (D- Oakland) verbally assaulted Louis W. 
Sullivan, President Bush's Secretary for Health and Human Services. Stark's 
rebarbative calumniations singularly combined ingredients of racial bigotry, 
intolerance, arrogance, cowardice, and emotional immaturity. Democracy, freedom 
of speech, and enlightened public policy would be doomed if Stark's style of 
discourse became the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Stark insulted Sullivan in labeling him a "disgrace" to his race and 
profession, and a craven political apologist for the allegedly racist politices 
of White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and budget director Richard Darman. 
These defamatory labels were justified, according to Stark, because Sullivan 
had voiced dissent from the congressman's health litmus tests: national health 
insurance; federal funding of abortions for the poor; and, expanded insurance 
for workers and the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's invectives epitomize racist thinking. They insist that a black 
office-holder disgraces his race if he declines to goose-step to a public 
policy viewpoint trumpeted by a majority of his racial cohort. In other words, 
a dissident black is traitorous to his race because all persons of color should 
be ideologically monolithic to fortify political clout. It is difficult to 
improve on Stark's racial stereotyping, which disrespects the right of blacks 
to be as individualized in their intellectual convictions as whites. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's temper tantrum also betrayed intolerance. Its message was that 
disagreement with Stark over health issues would invite character 
assassination, not efforts to persuade by dint of reason. It evokes memories of 
Senator Charles Sumner's (R-Mass.) caning by Preston (Bully) Brooks (D-S.C.) 
because the former sulfurously criticized slavery. It teaches that the best way 
to meet dissent is to destroy or intimidate the dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
What Stark ignores is that certitude is not the test of certainty, that time 
has upset many fighting faiths, and that reasoned deliberation is the oxygen of 
democracy and enlightened laws. How can the nation forge constructive health 
legislation if persons with viewpoints discrepant with Stark's are silenced by 
the fear of inviting attacks on their personal characters? That incubus on 
robust debate would forever stunt the quest for political truths. Analogously, 
imagine the state of physics today if Albert Einstein were ostracized and 
reprobated for challenging Newtonian axioms. 
</P>
<P>
Did Stark learn nothing from the Spanish Inquisition and the trial of Galileo? 
Did he learn no humility from recent national catastrophic-illness legislation 
that was promptly repealed because of its unpopularity? Those who believe that 
they monopolize truth endanger the intellectual challenges indispensable to 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's imprecations against Sullivan radiate arrogance. Who elected him to 
appraise Sullivan's contribution to the black race? Did Stark poll blacks (with 
franked mail) to ascertain their judgments? How does Stark know the consensus 
of the medical profession regarding Sullivan? Did the profession appoint Stark 
as its mouthpiece? 
</P>
<P>
Stark's self-proclaimed authority to speak for blacks and physicians makes Lady 
Macbeth's aspirations unambitious in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
The pummeling of Sullivan was also cowardly. The congressman is no ingenue 
regarding the executive branch and Cabinet dynamics. He knows that President 
Bush finally decides the health policies voiced by Sullivan. The secretary was 
appointed by the President and is subject to removal at Bush's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
But the President is too politically popular to permit attack with impunity. 
Thus, Stark targeted a less formidable figure whose denigration would not 
undermine his re-election prospects. His eruption at Sullivan echoes the 
immaturity of Cleopatra, who attacked the messenger for bringing disagreeable 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's tirade would be dismaying to civilized discourse even if he held no 
office. But his position as a congressman compounds the harm. For good or for 
ill, he teaches a style of public discourse by example. 
</P>
<P>
His teaching, however, is an enemy of measured and open-minded debate. These 
characteristics are not endemic in human nature; they must be sleeplessly 
cultivated if democracy is to escape the degradations emblematic of Germany's 
Third Reich. That is another lesson Stark has yet to learn, although he made 
progress in belatedly recanting some of his Sullivan malignities last Friday.

By California Assembly Speaker WILLIE BROWN (D-San Francisco), who spoke at the 
National Association of Black Journalists convention in Los Angeles, responded 
to Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), who stated last week that U.S. Health and Human 
Services chief Louis W. Sullivan, the Bush Administration's only black Cabinet 
member, had turned his back on the poor and was a disgrace to his profession 
and to his race. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think it was stupid of him to say that (the reference to race). 
</P>
<P>
I think it was accurate of him to assess that Sullivan was not doing his job. 
It's too bad that he tarnished his remarks with a racist statement. 
</P>
<P>
You have to understand that Sullivan has a responsibility to the poor of 
America and he should be on a holy mission to achieve those goals and to 
resolve health-care problems for them. (Health care) is not a luxury any of us 
can afford to lose. (Sullivan) must recognize this. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Stark should have been addressing. And it's unfortunate that Stark 
didn't keep his comments in that vein.

turn out badly. 
</P>
<P>
It's true, as she says, that I worry that we are going to be late for the 
theater, or a dinner party, or any event, yet we never are. The reason we are 
never late, of course, is that I worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
The other afternoon, for example, she drove us, in her car, to Loma Linda, out 
near Redlands. We were supposed to be there for dinner at 6 o'clock. We didn't 
get started until 4:25 and then she had to stop for gas. Knowing how heavy 
traffic would be on the San Bernardino Freeway, I kept saying, "We aren't going 
to make it." 
</P>
<P>
We made it exactly to the minute. But the reason we made it was that I kept 
telling her we weren't going to make it, and once we had passed through the 
Pomona traffic she hit the throttle and we went 75 m.p.h. all the way. I 
probably shouldn't expose her for driving that fast, but I'm trying to show 
that worrying gets things done. 
</P>
<P>
She says that when we travel I carry a bag full of "worst-case scenarios." 
There is some truth in that. As a sophisticated man of the world I am aware 
that danger lurks down every street. When we were in Madrid, I worried that she 
was going to have her purse snatched on the sidewalk. It didn't happen, but I 
was vindicated. We had dinner in Madrid with two friends from New York, and 
they told us later that after we parted the wife's purse was snatched on 
Madrid's main boulevard. She lost not only all her money and jewelry, but also 
her passport. 
</P>
<P>
Often, when we go to the Music Center, we eat at Rothschild's, taking a chance 
on finding seats at the bar, without reservations. Sometimes it has looked 
hopeless, but we have always found seats. Then I worry that we are going to be 
late for the curtain. I check my watch constantly, a nervous habit that she 
says detracts from her enjoyment of her dinner. I can only point out that we 
have never missed a curtain, and I give credit for that to my worrying. 
</P>
<P>
I don't worry about events that are beyond my control. I think the savings and 
loan disaster is the worst scandal in American history -- much worse than 
Watergate and Iran-Contra -- but there's nothing I can do about it so I don't 
worry about it. It's only going to cost about $500 billion anyway, and our 
progeny can pay it. 
</P>
<P>
I never worried about the Cold War or the nuclear holocaust. It was beyond my 
control. As it turned out, the very people who should have been worried didn't 
understand the situation. Not one of our politicians or pundits foresaw the 
collapse of the Berlin Wall or the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife decided that we should remodel our house I worried that it would 
exhaust our financial resources, that it would strain our marriage, and that, 
finally, it would give us twice the space we needed to live in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
The work has been going on now since June, and I must say that, so far, our 
architect and our contractor have been efficient, solicitous and pleasant to 
work with. They are doing an excellent job, but of course our finances will be 
exhausted, our marriage will be strained, and we will have twice as much room 
as we need. 
</P>
<P>
It may be, however, that in doubling our space, we will reduce the strain on 
our marriage. And in increasing the value of our house, we may ultimately 
reduce the strain on our finances. It's possible that all my worries will have 
been in vain. 
</P>
<P>
However, I think that one partner in every marriage ought to be a worrier. My 
worrying may be exactly why our marriage has survived 51 years. My wife is an 
incorrigible optimist. She really believes that nothing bad will ever happen to 
her. So far it hasn't, unless you count her marrying me. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there was the time in London when a thief plucked her billfold out of her 
open purse in the underground. He ran before I could tackle him, which I doubt 
that I would have tried to do anyway. The point is, I had warned her to be 
careful in the underground. It was an object lesson. 
</P>
<P>
That incident spoiled her day, but it did not spoil the rest of our vacation 
and it has not spoiled her attitude toward life. She still feels invulnerable. 
Her glass is half full; mine is half empty. 
</P>
<P>
My most persistent worry today is that our lifestyle has degenerated. We eat 
almost nothing but microwave dinners and we spend our evenings watching sex and 
violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, when the remodeling is finished, we will go back to reading and 
home-cooked dinners. But I worry that we won't.

Raid!: Ronald Reagan appeared in Fresno at a fund-raiser late last week and 
ended up eating bugs. The former President was plagued by a swarm of gnats 
buzzing the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan swatted at the bugs, coughed several times and said: "Some of these 
gnats got inside." He took a gulp of water and said: "They don't taste good at 
all," drawing a laugh from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Too Many Tammys: Tammy Faye Bakker and her daughter, Tammy Sue Bakker Chapman, 
recently went to the federal prison in Minnesota where patriarch Jim Bakker, 
the fallen evangelist, is serving 45 years for defrauding his followers. The 
three kicked around possible names for Tammy Sue's expected baby. Jim suggested 
Tammy, but the two women frowned and Tammy Sue said: "No, Dad, no -- not 
another Tammy." 
</P>
<P>
Dabbling Dean: Deborah Gore Dean, still embroiled in the ongoing investigation 
of the Housing and Urban Development scandals, now runs an antique shop called 
the Proud American in Washington's ritzy Georgetown section. But the embattled 
former HUD official still dabbles in lobbying, though she says her firm is 
"breathing shallow . . . just a blip on the screen." Many say Dean was the main 
string-puller for HUD's questionable housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Cheaper by the Dozen: Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs, Colo., has its 
own rewards for loyalty. When Vicki Kesler went there for the birth of her 12th 
child -- the seventh to be delivered at Valley View -- the hospital provided 
its services free. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be nice to do something for them because they had supported 
us so much over the years," said John Johnson, the hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Kesler, whose husband is an engineer, said that anytime she is asked to list 
her profession, she writes: "The Kesler home, as mother of 12. That should be 
sufficient."

INTO THE NIGHT: VIXEN INVADES CRAWFORD'S HAUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Party for the release of the all-woman, hard rock/heavy metal group 
Vixen's second album, "Rev It Up," at what was Joan Crawford's Brentwood estate 
from 1929 to 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Among the 700 guests in the back yard (yes, it was that big) 
were a heavy-metal who's who that included members of Winger, Bad English, 
Stryper, Mr. Big, Kik Tracee, XYZ, Warrant, Ratt, Faster Pussycat and The Cult. 
Also on hand were Capitol/EMI CEO Joe Smith, EMI president Sal Licata and 
hundreds of the backbone of rock 'n' roll types -- road managers, sound 
technicians, stock clerks from Tower Records. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: The next person who does the "no more wire hangers" routine from 
"Mommie Dearest" wears one home. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Charcoal grills were set on the back lawn for cooking chicken, hamburgers 
and hot dogs. There were also a number of bars with a daunting selection of 
liquor. "When you've got an album called 'Rev It Up,' " said bass player Share 
Pedersen, "you've got to have lots of booze at the party." 
</P>
<P>
Sign of the Times: All four women in Vixen carry stun guns. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: As one of the rare female hard-rock bands, Vixen members wear a 
variation on the standard black-leather rocker outfit. "We buy some things at 
Trashy Lingerie," said Pedersen. "I don't think the guys do that." 
</P>
<P>
Architectural Note: The bathtubs Crawford had removed because she regarded 
sitting in bath water unsanitary have been replaced. The present owners also 
had the mansion exorcised by a minister from the Healing Light Church. Fans can 
rest assured the ghost was not Crawford herself. The ghosts of a caretaker and 
a dog eluded the exorcist, however, and are still in the house, the owners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "If Ozzy Osbourne can wear eyeliner, women can play guitar," said 
Michael Des Barres. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: For most of the evening, guests were restricted to using the one 
bathroom in the pool house. This was not the sort of crowd that looks kindly on 
long waits. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Whoever came up with the idea of recycling Hollywood legend by 
linking Joan Crawford and a heavy-metal band has secured a place in the hype 
hall of fame.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recall being told that a person's blood pressure should add up to 
100 plus his age. The reason given me for this was that as a person grows 
older, he needs a higher blood pressure in order for his blood to get to all 
parts of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a 60-year-old man, for example, should have a blood pressure of 160. 
Do you go along with this reasoning? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: High blood pressure is not normal, regardless of the patient's age. If 
a patient of mine had a systolic pressure of 160, I would consider ways to 
reduce it, whether by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic means. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does having a sore throat mean that you have a cold? 
</P>
<P>
A: A viral illness, such as a cold or the flu, is a common cause of a sore 
throat. However, Dr. Paul Cook, an expert on throat problems, says that several 
conditions can account for it, including allergies, irritation due to smoking 
or other environmental pollutants, and even excessive yelling.

A SMASHING HAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rap world is full of naysayers who like to -- as they say in the trucking 
trade -- put the Hammer down. 
</P>
<P>
The enormously commercial M. C. Hammer, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Rap purists complain about his raspy, friendly bellow of a voice and call him 
"mush mouth." Rappers who deal more consistently and controversially with 
social themes in their lyrics have termed his often pointedly egocentric music 
"candy rap." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what your ultimate assessment of him on those counts, it's certainly 
true that he's far from the most articulate, original or relevant rap artist on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
So why was Hammer's show on Saturday at the San Diego Sports Arena as furiously 
entertaining an event as might be seen on any Southern California stage this 
year? 
</P>
<P>
Easy: Imagine Busby Berkeley doing his stuff at the Sports Connection. As a 
choreographer, Hammer combines the exuberance of an aerobics class with the 
scope of a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
And, with more than 30 dancers, singers and musicians on stage, most of them 
grinning and flailing their arms out in flawless sync at any given time, it 
would take a killjoy of uncanny proportions not to be overcome by the all-out 
jubilant physicality. 
</P>
<P>
A business-savvy Oakland native, Hammer hasn't sold more than 5 million copies 
of his second album and had it stay at No. 1 on the charts for nine weeks (a 
record run for a rap album) on the strength of what comes out of his mouth 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
His infectiously fun video for "U Can't Touch This" was easily the album's 
biggest sales boost, showing off not only his own fancy footwork, but his 
ability to choreograph an exultant team of dancers around him. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's choreography may not be as versatile as that seen in the recent Janet 
Jackson or Madonna concerts, and certainly it's not as ambitious thematically. 
Yet this show probably sends 'em home happier than either of those vaunted 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson operated in an essentially humorless, stark, black-and-white motif, and 
Madonna vogued her way through a set-shifting, narcissistic tour de force. But 
Hammer merely aims to please by any means necessary, creating a party 
atmosphere in which the viewer is made to feel a participant and not just an 
adulatory witness. 
</P>
<P>
The energy was not completely unflagging. Hammer brought things down in more 
ways than one with the ballads "Help the Children" (his updating of Marvin 
Gaye's "Mercy Mercy Me") and "Have You Seen Her" (the Chi-Lites redux), letting 
his singing posse croon while he rapped; the complaints about his rapping take 
on more validity when he goes to work, rather unconvincingly, on these 
dragging, slow songs. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, it was easy to see why Hammer -- whose Los Angeles tour dates 
haven't been announced yet -- is the most commercially viable rap artist out 
there now, though obviously not the most street-credible one. In a genre 
increasingly infused by social rage and X-rated language, he's evangelical (the 
gospel rap "Pray" was a crowd favorite), pointedly anti-drugs, pro-community 
responsibility, et al. 
</P>
<P>
He's obviously at the opposite end of the show-biz spectrum from 2 Live Crew, 
but he put in a plug for the controversial Miami rap group's right to freedom 
of expression. Hammer's own best means of expression is clearly body talk.

WITH AL GREEN, QUALITY OF SINGING OVERCOMES QUANTITY OF SONGS

There aren't many singers who could get away with the performance Al Green gave 
in his early show at the Coach House Saturday night. It's not just that he only 
appeared for 55 minutes -- he's been known to perform for as little as 35. But, 
evidently favoring a worn throat, he spent nearly half his time onstage 
mugging, featuring band solos and exhorting the audience to sing -- in short, 
doing everything but sing himself. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the Rev. Green ended the set with a bit of show-biz shuck and 
jive that was unbecoming to a man of the cloth. He pondered his watch and 
declared that the club required he end the show then but that they were going 
to go ahead and jam all night anyway. And then he curtly ended the no-encore 
show three minutes later. (In truth, he could have performed another 40 minutes 
before the club's schedule would have even neared disruption.) 
</P>
<P>
But, as Green is far from being just any performer, there was still more than 
enough magic in his show to make up for its lacks. Even when mute, his animated 
face and jump-for-joy moves were high entertainment. And when he did deign to 
sing, his fatigued voice soared and shouted with a feeling and abandon that 
only a handful of other living singers could match. 
</P>
<P>
When not performing in clubs, Green pastors a Southern gospel church, and his 
concerts are nearly unique in bringing close the pleasures of Saturday night 
and the exultation of Sunday morning. His miraculous voice can run the gamut of 
human expression: celebration, anguish, rapture, humor, sex -- it was all there 
in the nimble twists his vocal cords took Saturday. As with all of Green's 
shows of the last several years, he freely mixed his secular and gospel 
material. Just as soul music was largely borrowed from African-American gospel 
music, Green is now returning the favor. His 1987 "Everything's Gonna Be 
Alright" and 1989 "As Long as We're Together" offered Green's most insistent 
dance grooves since his mid-'70s "Love and Happiness," along with some 
decidedly uptown synthesizer lines. His most heated, fervent vocals were in 
those songs and in "Jesus Will Fix It," which found him repeating and 
embellishing a rhythmic phrase until it seemed like a locomotive coursing 
through the song. Throughout the show, his 10-piece band was so responsive that 
it could have been an extension of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Green hushed the band to a whisper on "Amazing Grace," allowing him a 
near-empty canvas on which to paint a vocal as bursting with color and feeling 
as any Van Gogh. His incredible, aching falsetto notes alone justified the 
ticket price. He gave a similar treatment to the Bee Gees' "How Can You Mend a 
Broken Heart," forgoing the microphone at one point to let his powerful plaints 
reach the audience directly. 
</P>
<P>
He also performed a sterling rendition of Otis Redding's "Dock of the Bay." His 
own hits, though, received short shrift. Most of "Let's Stay Together" was 
devoted to an audience sing-along, while he delivered only a few teasing 
choruses of "Tired of Being Alone." It was no less teasing when he had his hot 
horn section repeatedly punch out the clarion lines of "Love and Happiness" and 
then didn't bother to sing the song. 
</P>
<P>
The show was opened by the L.A. band Mama Stud. Though the six-piece outfit 
played a potentially intriguing blend of soul and folk music, its seven-song 
set seemed both unformed and unfunky. Even on King Floyd's "Groove Me Baby," 
they seemed unable to settle into a workable groove, and there was a decided 
lack of character or vocal control.

SAXOPHONISTS OF DIFFERENT TIMES AND TONES PLAY IN PERFECT SYNC

More separates tenor saxophonists Pete Christlieb and Bob Cooper than the 
20-year difference in their ages. The 64-year-old Cooper has a warm, mellow 
tone while the younger Christlieb's sound has a sharper edge. Cooper's solos 
are pithy and to the point, while Christlieb is slippery and liable to let his 
solos slide into high emotion. 
</P>
<P>
But when the two men are on the same bandstand, they're in perfect sync. This 
was apparent at the latest installment of the Friday evening concert series 
sponsored by KLON-FM at the Hyatt Newporter. Whether playing in unison, in 
harmony, or chasing one another around the chord changes of a song in a 
free-form exchange, the two musicians showed an empathy that would be hard to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening's first set opened, Christlieb, long a member of "The Tonight 
Show" band, was still on the freeway, traveling down from Burbank where the 
show is taped. No matter. Cooper and the fine supporting trio -- Tom Ranier on 
piano, John Leitham on bass and Michael Whited on drums -- warmed up with a 
lively Cooper original called "Faagen" (named for a pet cat) and "Kissin' Bug," 
a number credited to Billy Strayhorn as well as a good number of other 
Ellington band members, which began with Cooper suspending especially 
thoughtful lines over Leitham's smart walk. 
</P>
<P>
Christlieb arrived sometime during Ranier's engaging solo on "Stella by 
Starlight," and the stage was set. Minus the rhythm section, the two sax men 
jumped into "All the Things You Are," Christlieb stating the theme while Cooper 
danced above it. "The Days of Wine and Roses" featured a long break where the 
two men, again without the rhythm section, exchanged taunts and compliments, 
with Christlieb providing most of the up-top needling while Cooper, playing off 
Christlieb's sharp ideas, injected swinging lines. It was the kind of wide-open 
yet empathetic exchange one expects to hear from such brass-only groups as the 
World Saxophone Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
The second set (broadcast live over KLON) opened with Ray Noble's "Cherokee," 
played at a pace that Christlieb described in mangled Italian as "tempo de 
learno" (or, we assume, learner's tempo). The relaxed approach brought new life 
to the old be-bop warhorse while highlighting Cooper's considered, 
swing-influenced attack. A blues written by Cooper entitled "Bit O' Sweets" 
(dedicated to Harry (Sweets) Edison) opened with a spirited exchange between 
the two saxes supported only by Leitham. The tune gave both sax men a chance to 
play dirty behind the predictable beat and chord changes. 
</P>
<P>
Christlieb was left alone on a barely recognizable arrangement of "You've 
Changed," and his sensuous solo was one of the program's highlights. He 
deepened his tone on the ballad-paced, emotionally charged standard, adding a 
richness and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Ranier's clean, uncluttered accompaniment and melodic soloing were 
well attuned to the style and material in the program. Drummer Whited, who 
appears with the Harry James Orchestra, added sufficient sizzle, if not snap, 
to the rhythmic proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Leitham who grabbed the spotlight in the rhythm section. The young 
bassist didn't limit himself to any particular range of his instrument, popping 
out high-end embellishments to contrast with his loaded low-end. He's also an 
intriguing soloist whose melodic sweetness, accented with double-stops and 
rib-tickling strums in the upper register, garnered loud ovations from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The series continues next week with pianist Horace Tapscott and his trio.

A Fall Sneak: NBC is planning to announce "preview" times for new fall shows 
today, about a month before the start of the fall season. Brandon Tartikoff, 
NBC Entertainment Group chairman, and Warren Littlefield, NBC Entertainment 
president, said the new programming technique, called "double pumping," is 
expected to generate interest in the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots will be shown this month, then will be repeated during the fall premiere 
week. Among the shows to be previewed during the week of Aug. 20 will be 
"Life-stories," a medical drama; "Parenthood," starring Ed Begley Jr., based on 
the hit film of last year; "Hull High," a musical drama set in a high school; 
"Working It Out," a situation comedy with Jane Curtin and Stephen Collins; 
"Ferris Bueller," another movie-based series, and "The Guys Next Door," a new 
sitcom. GREG BRAXTON

Two Shows Sold Out: Tickets have sold out for two Los Angeles Festival events 
-- the Aug. 31 opening-night "Legend of the Water Flame" at Japan America 
Theatre, and the Sept. 15 presentation of the L.A. Poverty Department's 
"Jupiter 35" at Highways performance space in Santa Monica. Festival box-office 
manager Jill Rosenblatt said she expects tickets to be available throughout the 
month for the remaining 230 events. Tickets, which have been available by mail 
for more than a month, went on sale Friday at all Ticketmaster locations 
(except for UCLA Freud Amphitheater's "The Dragon's Trilogy," which will be 
sold through Ticketron outlets beginning Friday, and the Music Center's "Nixon 
in China," which will be available through Ticketmaster Sunday). GREG BRAXTON

LEITNER PASSED UP, WONDERS IF HE'S BECOME A 'NONENTITY'

Ted Leitner first learned that KFMB-TV (Channel 8) had picked Pat Brown and 
Dave Hood to host a new afternoon talk show late Thursday night, when a 
reporter told him the news. 
</P>
<P>
He was stunned. A few months earlier, he said, Channel 8 management had told 
the sportscaster that he was in line to host the show, pending a contract 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
After those meetings, "I never had one offer; I never had one discussion with 
them" about the show, Leitner said from Cincinnati, where he was working on San 
Diego Padres radio broadcasts. "Obviously they decided these two have more 
appeal and are better at it than me." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8's decision, announced Thursday, to drop the "Sun Up San Diego" 
morning show after 30 years was not much of a surprise, nor was the decision to 
start a weekday 3 p.m. talk show. "Sun Up" had been fading for several years, 
and the recent switch to 9 a.m. to accommodate network programming sent a clear 
signal that the show was on its last legs. The afternoon slot is a logical 
choice for a talk show, given the size of the potential audience and the thirst 
for these types of shows. 
</P>
<P>
However, the choice of "P.M. Magazine" hosts Brown and Hood stunned more than a 
few people, not just Leitner. They are little more than professional posers for 
the fluffy "P.M. Magazine," doing short, taped, extremely corny segues and 
occasional lightweight features. Brown's perky demeanor appears suited for a 
talk show, especially if Channel 8 is looking for an extremely perky program. 
But it's hard to imagine the slightly smarmy Hood as the genial co-host of a 
live talk show. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they are outstanding personalities and they will fit well into a 
talk-show format," said Channel 8 vice president Bill Moylan. 
</P>
<P>
The new talk show is being produced by the programming department, which also 
handles "P.M. Magazine," not the news department, which employs Leitner. 
</P>
<P>
Love him or hate him, Leitner is the most recognizable personality at Channel 
8. Management had given a tentative go-ahead to the concept of a Leitner-hosted 
talk show more than a year ago. However, the idea was abruptly dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Moylan said management decided Leitner was too busy to do a talk show. "You 
can't do a daily talk show and travel" with the Padres, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leitner believes the sales department scuttled the idea because "they thought 
the show would be a disaster and they didn't want to move 'MASH.' " 
</P>
<P>
The talk show concept resurfaced a couple of months ago, and Leitner said he 
was under the impression that he would be the host. But management never talked 
to him about it "one way or another," and he had no idea that Hood and Brown 
had been given the show until Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even get a memo or somebody saying to my face that your show is out," 
Leitner said. "I wish them well, but I'd like to know when this thing happened. 
When did I become a nonentity at the station?" 
</P>
<P>
Like an expansion team drafting players, KUSI-TV (Channel 51) is filling the 
roster for its new news team. 
</P>
<P>
Although nothing is definite yet, there are several positions that appear to be 
set. The anchors will be Roger Grimsby, the New York veteran, and George 
Reading, who most recently worked in Monterey. Staffers will include former 
Channel 39 reporter Cathy Clark, who will have a newsroom management position; 
former Channel 8 reporter Jesse Macias, and former Channel 39 reporter Doug 
Curlee. Danny Diaz, another veteran of Channel 39, reportedly will head up the 
camera department. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Luck, who last worked in Orlando, Fla., is already on board as sports 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Station management has talked to former Channel 8 anchorwoman Allison Ross 
about anchoring weekend newscasts, but they've been unable to agree on terms. 
</P>
<P>
Management would like to have a 10 p.m. newscast on the air by Sept. 10, but 
that appears to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Something called the San Diego Film Festival opens tonight at the new Mann 
Theater complex in Mission Valley. The list of films is remarkable only by the 
inclusion of an unprecedented number of bad films. 
</P>
<P>
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," "Airport '77," "K-9," "Return of the Killer 
Tomatoes," "A Time of Destiny" and "Tora! Tora! Tora!" are part of the series, 
described as "adventurous" and "ambitious" in the festival press package. More 
than anything, the festival seems to be an advertisement for the financially 
strapped San Diego Motion Picture &amp; Television Bureau. Most of the 
selections were at least partially filmed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The screenings, which continue throughout the week, are free. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV has filled one of its five new producer positions. Paul Marshall, who 
has worked with the station for 23 years, has been rehired as executive 
producer of arts and cultural programming. Marshall was one of the seven 
producers laid off last month. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I never want to see another picture of a Soviet sailor dancing, drinking, 
singing, playing billiards, eating a hamburger or playing pinball. Channel 10 
led its 11 p.m. newscast Thursday night with yet another feature showing the 
sailors out on the town, saving that little war in the Middle East for later. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
KNSD-TV (Channel 39) was all set to produce regular 30-second spots featuring 
San Diego Chargers' general manager Bobby Beathard saying inspirational 
football kinds of things. The spots would be sponsored by a third party and run 
throughout the season, but not necessarily tied to Charger games. At the last 
minute, however, Beathard backed out, reportedly because Chargers management 
felt the team should concentrate more on winning football games. Charger 
officials were unavailable for comment Friday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Landmark Theaters is reportedly negotiating to expand the Cove Theater. Two 
screens would be added, if the company is able to lease space next to the 
existing theater and gain approval from the city of San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-AM (760) personnel were cruising down the freeway in their new, 
mondo-cool, 65-foot "live broadcast center," a sort of an urban radio-assault 
vehicle, when they heard a crash. The sliding glass doors had fallen off, logo 
and all. Fortunately there were no injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dred Scott, who lost his morning news slot with XTRA-FM (91X) when the Berger 
&amp; Prescott team was hired, has landed a job with KFOG in San Francisco. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Mac Hudson and Joe Bauer have signed a new deal with KFMB-AM (760). No further 
details were available.

BATTLE SPARKLES IN A BOWL OF CORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pops with a twist is the house specialty at Hollywood Bowl. This weekend David 
Zinman and the Los Angeles Philharmonic visited Vienna and found . . . 
"Hee-Haw." 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the offering promised intriguing charm, with Kathleen Battle the 
soloist and Zinman leading the orchestra with a violin. But the fiddle proved 
simply an excuse for some Jack Benny gags, which in turn proved the most 
sophisticated part of the long, self-deprecating cornball show. 
</P>
<P>
The Viennese are not above slapstick, as anyone who has seen their New Year's 
Eve programs can attest. But this performance might well have been stickered 
with a warning label for the benefit of the innocents -- surely some among the 
11,158 Friday, 13,973 Saturday -- who expected more sentiment than silliness 
from "An Evening in Old Vienna." 
</P>
<P>
In a way the thing was shrewdly planned, so that by the time the final Johann 
Strauss Jr. set rolled in -- Zinman conducting "The Hunt Polka" with a rubber 
shotgun while rubber chickens dropped from above, Zinman conducting the 
"Thunder and Lighting Polka" in a raincoat while the stage lights flashed -- 
expectations had been suitably lowered. 
</P>
<P>
Illuminating the desperate hokeyness was Battle. She began with the noblest 
lullaby of all, Mozart's "Ruhe sanft, mein holdes Leben," bridging the Bowl 
distances with soft pliant lines, then turned to caressive, gentle seduction 
for "Batti, batti, o bel Masetto" while in streamed a host of very late 
arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Battle invested the "Laughing Song" from "Die Fledermaus" with demure wit and 
vocal sparkle, while the stagehand who would drop the rubber chickens in 
Strauss clambered through the speakers above her. She lavished shimmering sound 
in great cresting arches on "Vilia" from "The Merry Widow," while Zinman and 
half the band fell far behind in the cadences. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra -- or rather, a small part of it -- had the best instrumental 
moments in Mozart's "Serenata Notturna," K. 239, with concertmaster Sidney 
Weiss leading the concertino part blithely. The rest of the program was played 
as the butt of Zinman's stand-up monologues and costumed shtick. 
</P>
<P>
And now, for something completely different. . . . JOHN HENKEN

DEPECHE MODE GROWS UP -- BUT NOT THE CROWD; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: FOOD FIGHTS IN THE UPPER DECKS DON'T UNDERMINE THE SYNTHESIZER 
BAND'S ANGST-THEMED SHOW AT DODGER STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Holden Caulfield stood up at Dodger Stadium on Saturday and swore an oath about 
"deciding in your youth on a policy of truth." But Holden came in the guise of 
Depeche Mode singer Dave Gahan, a center fielder in the wry. In the first of 
two sold-out shows at the stadium, Gahan danced exuberantly to dark-toned music 
amid stage smoke and flashy lighting, stating his pledge in front of about 
50,000 screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
An incongruous setting for such a personal -- if universal -- act of 
expression? Perhaps. But as Gahan (and most of the 50,000) sang, "Everything 
counts in large amounts." 
</P>
<P>
As media becomes ever more mass, adolescent anguish requires, even demands, 
such rituals for validation. Basically, that's the impetus and history of rock 
'n' roll itself, and Depeche Mode may well be the prime validator for this 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
At times, though, the setting threatened to undermine this black celebration in 
Dodger Blue. It's not just that the stadium is a lousy place to see a concert, 
its layout enhancing the distancing nature inherent in such large-scale events. 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing was the renewal of what has become a tradition at large outdoor 
concerts: the throwing of full soft-drink cups and other objects from the upper 
decks onto the people below. Such behavior is hardly appropriate with a band 
that is trying to encourage honesty and respect. 
</P>
<P>
That such behavior didn't undermine the show is credit to both the band and the 
majority of its fans. Maybe it takes the presence of a minority that doesn't 
get it to heighten appreciation for those who do. And Depeche -- which refused 
to take the stage until the food fight stopped -- is showing encouraging signs 
of maturity in its music and performance. 
</P>
<P>
Gahan has developed into a very entertaining frontman, his gyrations neither 
detracting from the Angst theme nor burdening it with too much irony. And there 
were even new and encouraging elements of sensuality and humor in the arty film 
clips that accompanied certain songs. 
</P>
<P>
The food fight did weaken what should have been an auspicious appearance of 
second- billed band Electronic, whose set incorporated the first-ever U.S. 
stage performance of the Pet Shop Boys. Electronic's pleasant but 
less-than-compelling modern dance music, a collaboration between New Order 
singer Bernard Sumner and ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, with assistance from 
Pet Shoppers Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, had trouble competing with the crowd 
disturbances for attention. And the much-anticipated appearance of Tennant and 
Lowe boiled down to just two songs, neither of them Pet Shop numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Nitzer Ebb opened the evening with 40 minutes of unpleasant, beat-heavy 
industrial disco. A little goes a long way, or as one person was heard to say 
when the trio started its fourth or fifth song: "Haven't we heard this one 
already?"

2 SOLOISTS DISTINCTIVE AT PEPPERDINE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Malibu Strawberry Creek Music Festival wheeled around into its orchestral 
phase Saturday night at Pepperdine University's cozy Smothers Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Until this midway point, the five-concert series had been preoccupied with 
chamber music -- a medium more suited to the dry, intimate Smothers acoustics 
than big-thinking orchestral classics. Nevertheless, Yehuda Gilad and the 
mid-sized Festival Orchestra served up a trio of orchestral works planned 
around no less lofty a theme than last November's fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, there was distinction to be heard -- mostly from the two guest 
soloists, New York Philharmonic concertmaster Glenn Dicterow and cellist Peter 
Rejto, in the Brahms Double Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra. Dicterow 
was virtually faultless, brandishing a gleaming, marvelously agile, world-class 
tone that blended beautifully with Rejto's less secure, but mostly smooth, 
suave cello. It was a true collaboration, with neither player dominating. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gilad was content mostly to push straightforwardly ahead while 
giving his soloists plenty of room to sing. Had the performance taken place in 
a more reverberant hall, it might have had an even more powerful impact. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 opened with a cautious, somewhat broadly paced 
movement and sported lean, clear textures everywhere. As the piece wore on, 
Gilad eventually was able to produce some essential sharp-edged rhythm from his 
generally tight ensemble, though he couldn't do much about the frequently sour 
intonation of the violins. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Brahms and Beethoven, Gilad offered a rarity -- the first seven of 
Max Bruch's 15 "Swedish Dances." The portion heard here revealed a rather 
earnest attempt to emulate Brahms' own "Hungarian Dances," one that never quite 
lets its hair down despite a few dashing moments. 
</P>
<P>
The program booklet, by the way, couldn't make up its mind as to whether the 
Brahms Double Concerto was written in A minor or C. The former is correct.

SCOTS' DEBUT REVEALS DEPTH ON THE NILE

<P>
"Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream" -- John Lennon's invitation 
from the '60s -- applies nicely to a trip down the recordings of the Blue Nile. 
But the Los Angeles concert debut of the Scottish group at the Wadsworth 
Theater on Friday proved a surprisingly mind-on affair. 
</P>
<P>
The strikingly unique, largely electronic textures of the music -- as 
distinctive as, say, Peter Gabriel's -- were quite floatable at the concert, 
warmly and invitingly so. Yet the show was curiously involving. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on one level, curiosity played a role: the how-would-they-do-it-live 
factor. The studio work of the trio is so finely sculpted that even given the 
state of technology and the assistance of three augmenting musicians, it was 
fascinating to see it come alive. 
</P>
<P>
But there was much more to it than that. It's not as if the Blue Nile has, as 
singer Paul Buchanan joked, a "polished stage act." The band's personable 
reserve, and especially Buchanan's endearing nervousness, only added depth to 
the full emotions of the songs and served to draw the appreciative audience 
even more into the music. STEVE HOCHMAN

Whatever is mine is mine, and whatever is yours is half mine. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to America's Mideast, here in the Northwest. Here in the land of the 
angry and the scared, the right and the righteous. 
</P>
<P>
Under the exaggerated shadow of what the nation has come to know as the cute 
but delicate spotted owl, in the wary gaze of wealthy Pacific Rim neighbor 
Japan, amid enchanted glades of soaring cedars and measured rhythms of 
still-liveable cities, the Pacific Northwest is at war with itself. 
</P>
<P>
It's a battle over jobs, money, recreation, scenic beauty, economic freedom 
and, if you listen to some of the predictions of conservationists, over whether 
humankind can avert an environmental catastrophe when it sees one coming. In 
some eyes, it's also a fight about Japanese colonization of the Northwest, and 
a measure of America's international environmental leadership. 
</P>
<P>
One thing for sure, it's a war in which all the competitors think they are 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
It's the war over nature's resources. What to use? What to save? Today's 
battleground is America's great and ancient rain forest, that which remains. 
Tomorrow, it could be over the storied but troubled salmon. Across time, the 
results seemed destined to define the terms of life in the Northwest, for its 
people and for its landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no middle ground," says Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt, wearily. 
Even when he visits first-graders in school, he braces for argument. "We have 
failed to create a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps two-thirds of Oregonians, and maybe as many in Washington state, have 
chosen sides -- they know which future is right -- an astonishing degree of 
polarization. Many others find neutrality a difficult discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the country has heard the distant din of this battle -- the cries to 
save the shy and endangered spotted owl. The people here, however, know the owl 
is but the spoils of a bigger fight. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a day goes by, big city or small, in which newspapers don't feature some 
divisive development or fiery comment. Along some highways, residents proclaim 
their allegiance with Day-Glo signs in their yards or ribbons on their car 
aerials. Even some advertisers, such as Gary &amp; Merle's Tire Service here in 
Albany, want you to know about their all-season radials and also their views. 
So their newspaper ad begins: "Support Our Timber Industry." 
</P>
<P>
"This has cleaved the state like nothing else. It's an elemental struggle, it 
brings up the essential duality of Oregon," says fifth-generation 
Northwesterner Bob Applegate, a Portland public affairs executive. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what you may have heard, the rarest things in these parts are not 
spotted owls but open minds. 
</P>
<P>
To sample the deep emotions, and the potentially deeper national and global 
consequences, one needs a varied wardrobe and a vigorous constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"This," all sides say, "is something you have to come see." 
</P>
<P>
So, come hike the Pacific Crest Trail with the environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
In southern Oregon, in an area the locals call The Greensprings, the legendary 
high-country foot trail, designated a national scenic pathway, winds through 
scrub oak, into stands of ancient firs and cedars, over ridge tops with 
100-mile vistas and across . . . to clear-cuts. 
</P>
<P>
As in every war, the symbols are painful and disturbing. Clear-cuts are hard to 
top for shock value. 
</P>
<P>
There is an old story environmentalists love to tell -- how a plane load of 
reporters were flying to view the devastation caused by the eruption of Mount 
St. Helens a decade ago. The sight brought gasps of disbelief -- it looked like 
ground zero at a nuclear explosion, it looked like the moon, or hell. Wow! 
"Wait a minute," their guide is supposed to have said. "We're not to the 
volcano damage yet, this is just a clear-cut." 
</P>
<P>
They are hot, barren and ugly. And this is where Andy Kerr, the salty 
conservation director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, likes to begin. 
Grab a stump and listen. It's a story that can get complicated quickly. But 
reduced to its simplest, the environmentalists see this: 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all the Northwest's old growth has been logged off of private lands 
and much of the state lands too. That leaves public timberlands managed by the 
federal government as the primary reserve of the huge old trees so valued 
today. 
</P>
<P>
With the price of logs at an all-time high, driven up by demand for raw logs in 
Japan, the pressure on national forests and Bureau of Land Management timber is 
extraordinary. Why else in heaven's name would the bureau allow cutting right 
to the edge of the famed Pacific Crest Trail just east of Ashland? 
</P>
<P>
Timbermen, using their political muscle to keep the chain saws operating -- to 
"keep the cut up," as they say here -- threaten to disrupt the integrity of the 
Northwest ecosystem, one of the world's important atmospheric regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Old forests store water, preserve a weak and fragile topsoil, nourish the 
atmosphere and maintain one of the richest and densest inventories of life 
forms on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The owl's struggle to survive shows that the remaining forest is losing its 
integrity. Environmentalists believe any number of other forest animals are 
dying out -- among them the small mammal, the fisher, and a sea bird known as 
the marbled murrelet. Salamanders and other creatures are endagered, too. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr and others argue that 90% of the region's old forests already has been 
logged. To replace just one acre will take 250 years. "That's enough," he says. 
"The timber industry likes to talk about the agricultural model, with their 
tree farms. We prefer the mining model. And they've mined enough. It's time to 
leave the ancient forests alone." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "What we really need is an endangered ecosystem act." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist and governmental forest management experts argue that 
replanting old forests with tree farms is OK for business, but not necessarily 
good for the ecology. Forest plantations in Europe show that yield from 
third-growth harvest drops sharply, probably because there are so few nutrients 
in forest soil. In the Northwest, millions of acres of second growth are 
maturing. 
</P>
<P>
"If these tree farms don't work, something needs to be left behind. We are at a 
junction in history. Either we change things significantly or we lose the 
opportunity to change them," says Victor M. Sher, Seattle lawyer with the 
Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The global consequences are both political and environmental. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the richest nation in the world, are going to tell the dirt-poor people of 
Brazil and Indonesia and Zaire to be good environmentalists and not cut down 
their rain forests? Ha. We're showing them how," says Elliott A. Norse, 
ecologist and author of the book "Ancient Forests of the Pacific Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
"In Amazonia, ancient forests are falling 1% a year. We're cutting ours at 3% a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
So, come try on the the spiked caulk (pronounced cork) boots of the logger. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the summer in Albany is one of the world's largest timber carnivals. 
Here's where the work of cutting and chopping and tree-climbing is turned into 
sporting competition -- a big, fun summer picnic. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no escaping the anxiety. For the World Championship finals in this 
open-arms, historic old town, attendance was predicted at 20,000. Fewer than 
3,000 show up. The mood is pensive, if not downright glum. Loggers know they 
are cornered. 
</P>
<P>
Pull up a chair, and listen to the timbermen: 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are exaggerating and insensitive to the personal pain they 
are causing. They are sanctimonious in claiming to love the outdoors more than 
the men who have worked there, father and son, all these years. Citified news 
reporters are too easily spooked by cries that the end is near. 
</P>
<P>
"We get people from the East who are surprised to see any trees up here. They 
have a picture in their minds of about 50 acres of old-growth left with 100 
chain saws waiting to cut it down," said Charles Cox, who drives a log truck 
out of Springfield. "Then they see the trees and they say, wow, isn't this 
beautiful, we got to save it. But much of what they are seeing isn't old 
growth, it's second growth." 
</P>
<P>
Some waterways are cleaner in these be-careful times, and some fish runs are 
improving. The science of timber management is advancing. The United States is 
doing better than most countries with its forests. But loggers don't feel they 
get much credit for trying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awfully hard not to get bitter," says Mike McKay, a Eugene millworker and 
activist with the Yellow Ribbon Coalition, which seeks to right logging's name 
and revive the industry. 
</P>
<P>
It's a herculean task. Even before the owl, the Northwest logger was in 
eclipse. Virtually every study, the government's, the environmentalists', the 
industry's, shows decreasing demand for the men who cut, yard, truck and mill 
the wood. One way or the other, their load is going down. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanization has made great strides in this old-fashioned roustabout business 
of lumberjacking. Exports of logs to Asia may be up, but that also means fewer 
mills producing finished lumber here. 
</P>
<P>
All kinds of job-loss numbers are thrown about. William B. Conerly, vice 
president and economist of First Interstate Bank in Portland, offers a 
mid-range prediction. Stopping cutting on old-growth forests to protect the 
spotted owl will put 15,000 timber workers out of their jobs, spread over the 
next three to four years. That compares with employment gains of 50,000 in the 
state last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect is to bring our growth rate down, but it does not bring us into a 
recession," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the loggers' lament isn't just the declining curve of job 
opportunities. No, it's the very self-image of these people who work in the 
woods. Machines reduce jobs but don't take your pride; exporting logs to Japan 
means less work in domestic lumber mills but selling to the highest bidder is 
the American way. Those things just make you sad. Environmentalists believe 
what loggers do is wrong. And that makes you mad. 
</P>
<P>
So everywhere you turn at the logging festival there are signs of protest 
against environmentalists and their damned owl. 
</P>
<P>
There is more resentment to be passed around, too. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese log importer Toshio Narita, general manager of the Meiko Unyu Co., 
appeared at the timber carnival and praised the quality of Oregon logs. As for 
proposed bans on exporting raw logs? "He doesn't want the ban," says his 
intrepreter. "He wants more logs." Japanese millworkers need jobs, too, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks leave some in the audience quietly seething. 
</P>
<P>
"How can they have this guy come here when the Japanese are taking our logs and 
making Sony stereo cabinets and shipping them back to us -- how could they have 
a guy like that here?" fumes Paul Mumford, who operates Sedlak's, a logging 
outfitter in Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
In many quarters, shiploads of logs, bark and all, going to Japan are a 
symbolic flash point with almost as much emotional swag as clear-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in an advisory referendum, Oregonians voted 9 to 1 against exporting 
logs from state lands. It was the biggest electoral landslide in Oregon 
history. In some timber counties the margin against exports was 96%, and some 
folks still wonder just who were those maverick 4% anyway? 
</P>
<P>
If jobs are really the issue in the fight over timber lands, why ship one out 
of every four logs to the Far East, chiefly Japan? By law, logs from federally 
managed lands cannot be exported from Oregon and Washington, but that just 
increases the incentive to export all the logs that can be cut on private and 
state-owned lands, or to export timber that has been minimally milled. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Forest Service study suggested that 75% of the jobs in jeopardy in the 
battle over the spotted owl could be saved by banning all log exports. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a nasty Gordian knot for politicians. Washington state, for instance, 
has no income tax. Forestry revenues help pay for schools. To a lesser extent 
that is true in Oregon. And ever wonder why road repair crews are so aggressive 
in Oregon? Why the state paves even logging roads? They are financed in part 
from timber sales. 
</P>
<P>
With the Japanese paying 20% more for logs than domestic mills, the incentive 
to export is compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing exports may save jobs but almost surely result in lowered services or 
a need for more taxes -- and no one believes there is a 90% majority for that. 
</P>
<P>
So the Northwest finds itself boxed in, and sometimes its guilt shows through. 
At the port of Anacortes, Wash., local diners at a waterfront restaurant are 
offered a printed statement describing the view outside. That rusty cargo ship 
diners see is from Panama, taking 2.4 million board feet of Northwestern raw 
logs to Japan. The statement from the port officials tries to soften the scene: 
"During its brief stay here approximately 35 local persons will be employed in 
the loading operation." 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese keep asking, when is the mood here going south?" says Gov. 
Goldschmidt. 
</P>
<P>
He has championed Japanese business investment in Oregon, promising a better 
educated and more stable work force than in California and cheaper land prices. 
The result has been a mushrooming of Japanese electronics assembly plants here. 
And, as many happy Oregonians tell you, this means a more diverse economy, less 
dependence on timber. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are those with second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
What can you say about a place that exports raw materials and then provides an 
inexpensive locale for assembly-work jobs? 
</P>
<P>
"Colony" is the loaded word that comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Several Northwest Democrats have dared utter the description in the last couple 
of years. It has become part of Democrat Harry Lonsdale's campaign to unseat 
24-year veteran Republican Mark O. Hatfield in the U.S. Senate. No log exports, 
says Lonsdale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's criminal. We cut down 500- or 1,000-year-old trees, send them to Japan, 
where they make value-added products. That's what Third World countries do, 
what colonies do. And we shouldn't be a colony to anybody," says Lonsdale. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt says that Oregonians chafe because, "The underlying tenor is that 
the Japanese play by a different set of rules." 
</P>
<P>
The forestry and resources fight does not end at the forests. One needs to walk 
down to the river, say, the biggest river in the Northwest. The fracas brewing 
here is over the wild chinook and sockeye and coho salmon of the Columbia 
River, the creatures that have come to be the very symbol of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, having challenged business-as-usual forest management by 
seeking protections for the endangered owl, now are taking aim at the 
day-to-day management of the Northwest's mightiest river and its watersheds by 
seeking protection for its once bountiful natural salmon. Earlier this year, a 
group called Oregon Trout filed a petition asking government endangered species 
designation for five native salmon runs on the Columbia system. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of dams on this river and its tributaries produce more than $3 billion a 
year in low-cost electrical power on which the region depends. It is a major 
shipping waterway for the region and provides vast irrigation. But the dams and 
turbines, even with their special bypasses for fish, have proved an obstacle 
for young fish trying to return to the ocean, and upstream logging has spoiled 
spawning beds. Where there were once countless millions of these fish in 
seasonal spawning migrations, they now can be counted in the few thousands or 
sometimes just hundreds. Hatchery salmon supplement the total, but many fishery 
biologists warn that these strains are genetically narrow, inferior and 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
The national Marine Fisheries Service is taking the first preliminary look at 
the petitions -- the first step in deciding whether these wild fish runs need 
government protection. This was raised as an issue back in the late 1970s and 
since then more than $100 million has been spent trying to enhance the local 
fishery and stave off more drastic moves. 
</P>
<P>
Regional experts are only beginning to try to fathom the economic consequences 
of what might have to be done next on the Columbia and its watersheds to save 
the native fish. Re-engineering of dams, increased water releases during salmon 
runs and upstream logging restrictions are among possible solutions -- but all 
could be costly and bitterly contested. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot leave the resource battle without visiting the high-rises of 
Portland and Seattle and the other offices that are home to the timber industry 
executives. For others, this battle over the trees and water may have new 
urgency. For the beleaguered wood products industry, it's the same old saw. 
</P>
<P>
"The root issue remains as it has for 20 years, how much federal forest land 
will be managed to include timber production and how much will be preserved," 
says the Northwest Forest Resource Council. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry officials believe to the bone that the health of the forests is 
not in danger nearly as much as their own livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
There are widely differing points of view, depending on whether you are a 
landowner and export your own logs, or a smaller operator who depends on the 
right to cut on national forests, or hold some other niche in the cycle. But 
there are some beliefs that are shared. Listen: 
</P>
<P>
Sure there have been maddening occurances in the woods. Some old-line companies 
have been bought out by highly leveraged outsiders, which then had to liquidate 
forests to pay the debt. But don't overlook the big and long-range timber 
players, who have been here for years and are investing for years more. Don't 
call them cut and run. 
</P>
<P>
There are 7.25 million acres of old growth left in the Northwest. Of that, 4.2 
million is already set aside for preservation in national parks, protected 
wilderness areas and along sensitive watersheds. How much is enough? 
</P>
<P>
Clear-cuts are not as dead as environmentalists would portray. Within a year 
after a cut, the ground is nurturing new trees, albeit often with the help of 
herbicides to kill competing shrubs. Don't look at the site as destroyed, just 
harvested. Imagine wheat fields on an 80-year rotation. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, tree farms work. Why else would we bet our futures on them? 
True, big trees will give way to smaller ones, but smaller trees grow more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Really, when you think about it, wood and timber producers are 
environmentalists, too. At least that is the theme of the industry's new public 
relations offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Willamette Celebrates Earth Day Every Day," reads a full-page newspaper 
advertisement that Willamette Industries Inc. purchased recently in the Albany 
Democrat-Herald to catalogue both its economic importance to the region and 
also its environmental expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the industry PR, however, has an old-fashioned bellicoseness to it -- 
slightly crude or, at best, preaching to the already committed. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, one timber products coalition brushed off the idea of new, less 
environmentally destructive techniques in forestry, saying environmentalists 
must also consent to opening up wilderness areas for logging. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Oregon Timber Industries Assn. passes out 16-page color brochures 
explaining that this is really a fight pitting "East Coast environmental groups 
against freckle-faced loggers." 
</P>
<P>
Another organization curiously decries the "eco-anxiety industry" for the 
six-figure salaries -- $100,000 to $200,000 -- paid the nation's handful of top 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem with the radical environmentalists is that they've traded in 
their blue jeans for Italian-designer suits," says Charles S. Cushman of the 
Multiple Land Use Alliance. His point was unclear. According to a Seattle Times 
survey this summer, several timber company executives, including George 
Weyerhaeuser, made more than $1 million in salary. 
</P>
<P>
Still, political and economic leaders in the region believe the industry has 
been called to compromise repeatedly in this war, and has done so, even if 
complaining all the way. At the same time, these same leaders say 
environmentalists may be too smug in refusing compromise now that they feel the 
breezes blowing at their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why so much hullabaloo befalls otherwise minor events, such as 
next month's scheduled Breitenbush concert, an environmentalist music festival 
among old-growth national forest lands in central Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
It seems a nesting pair of endangered owls was found near the concert site, and 
the U.S. Forest Service said the festival would not be allowed during the 
critical breeding period of summer. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists agreed to move the concert about a mile away to avoid 
disturbing the owls, but they howled that the Forest Service action was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that logging was allowed nearby in June (although with hand saws 
only) and that further cuts are planned in the area this autumn and next year. 
Why single out their annual event? 
</P>
<P>
"It shows their real concern has never been the owl," responds Valerie Johnson 
of the pro-logging Oregon Lands Coalition. "Their real goal is to set aside 
old-growth forests as playgrounds for themselves and their elite friends." 
</P>
<P>
Because virtually everyone in the country has a stake in the national forests, 
much of the day-to-day controversy involves timber management on public lands. 
But private ownership of Northwest trees is spread wide, and all varieties of 
companies have found themselves drawn into the war. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror Co., for instance, owns about 900 acres, down from 265,000 acres a 
few years ago. Of that, a small parcel, about 57 acres is prime old-growth 
forest in an area known to contain endangered owls. Environmentalists had 
strongly protested a company plan that optioned logging rights to the tract. 
</P>
<P>
That option expired, and with environmentalists watching every move, Times 
Mirror now says the trees will not be felled. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what we're going to do with it. But we're not going to cut it 
and we're not going to sell it to someone who is going to cut it," says Charles 
R. Redmond, executive vice president. Trading the land or perhaps even donating 
it for preservation are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
So come finish the battle zone tour and journey into a national forest with a 
ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Up in the high country of the Mt. Hood National Forest, just east of Portland, 
you can see across five mountain ridges. From up here, the patchwork of 
clear-cuts resembles the fairways and greens of some giant, far-off golf course 
spread over the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
What does the vista mean to acting District Ranger Rob MacWhorter, a 10-year 
veteran forester? 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly?" MacWhorter begins. Then he pauses. "Well, what this tells me is 
that we've over cut." 
</P>
<P>
It is a tribute to the Forest Service that dissent like this is permitted in 
the ranks. Over the years, the Forest Service has described itself as managing 
the timberlands for "multiple use," but the bureaucratic imperative has always 
been "to get the cut out," because the agency earns its budget selling trees. 
So, to talk about reducing the cut is to talk about reducing the budget. And in 
federal bureaucracies, that is a painful position. 
</P>
<P>
But more and more, that's the attitude of rank-and-file rangers of the Forest 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry G. Allen is a 35-year veteran and serves as the Forest Service's 
Northwest environmental affairs director. It's not a matter of whether to 
reduce the timber harvest, but how much and how fast, Allen explains. 
</P>
<P>
Each forest jurisdiction in the Northwest either has or is working on 
completing a long-term management plan. In total, they indicate something like 
a one-third drop in harvesting. And that is before extra set-asides to preserve 
spotted owl habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time the decisions were easy. There was plenty of forest to go 
around," says Allen. "Now the Forest Service is beginning to make the tough 
decisions: Who isn't going to get what they want." 
</P>
<P>
To its mounting frustration, however, the Forest Service is being shoved onto 
the sidelines in making these tough calls. Politicians and judges increasingly 
are assuming that role. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the White House indicated that it wants to see if it can soften 
the job loss associated with rapid timber harvest reductions proposed by 
government scientists to protect the owl. 
</P>
<P>
This is a tricky political maneuver, and Democratic politicians such as 
Washington Gov. Booth Gardner warn President Bush not to ignore the judgments 
of experts "or this thing is going to blow up on you." 
</P>
<P>
A high-level Administration task force is supposed to propose a plan by Sept. 1 
to save both the owl and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is expected to plunge headlong into the fray, with the logging 
industry seeking a one- or two-year reprieve from new restrictions and 
environmentalists vowing to give not a single grove without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the timbermen and the environmentalists argue the future of the 
great forests and the great forestry industry in an ever-growing barrage of 
lawsuits. In this two-state region so far in 1990, the Forest Service reports 
receiving an average of one administrative appeal each day and being sued about 
once each week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the tragedy for us," says Goldschmidt. "The one thing the world wants 
and which we do so well, we haven't decided whether we want to pursue anymore."

<P>
A detachment of 225 U.S. Marines swept into Liberia's embattled capital of 
Monrovia early Sunday to evacuate Americans after a rebel leader threatened to 
arrest foreigners in an attempt to provoke international intervention in the 
nation's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
But the Marines, who flew in from four U.S. ships that have been stationed 
offshore for months, were under orders not to actively intercede in the 
fighting among government forces loyal to President Samuel K. Doe and two 
separate rebel groups, according to U.S. officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue mission came on the eve of an African summit scheduled for today to 
discuss the creation of a multinational African military force to bring peace 
to Liberia, where civil war broke out seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The session was scheduled for Banjul, Gambia, under pressure from Nigeria, the 
country with the largest and best-trained military in West Africa. Nigerian 
officials said earlier this weekend that they might send a peacekeeping force 
themselves if no other solution arises to the sustained tribal conflict in 
Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
The American rescue party encountered no resistance when it reached Liberian 
soil about 9 a.m. local time. By late in the day, 59 American citizens had been 
flown to safety on the Saipan, a helicopter assault ship. From there the 
evacuees are expected to be taken to Freetown, the capital of neighboring 
Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
All U.S. citizens in Liberia had been warned of the danger of remaining there 
and asked to depart, but many declined, Bush Administration officials said. 
With the evacuation of 59, about 311 remained at the end of the day Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As the operation got under way, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said it was intended to evacuate all of the Americans who wished to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Operation Sharp Edge," the evacuation saw Marines in combat gear swept 
ashore aboard 23 Sea Knight, Sea Stallion and Cobra helicopters to put the 
Americans aboard. According to the Pentagon, the move was ordered after a 
formal request from U.S. Ambassador Peter de Vos. 
</P>
<P>
The forces were sent in to "secure the (U.S.) Embassy, accomplish the rescue 
operation, secure and remove Americans from two communications sites (and) 
remain as long as necessary to assure the security" of the remaining embassy 
staff, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that, in addition to the embassy, Americans were evacuated 
from a "Voice of America site" five miles north of the compound and from a 
"telecommunications site" six miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources, who declined to be identified, said the stations 
actually served to transmit information from all of Africa to CIA headquarters 
outside Washington and to assist submarine navigation in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Although a skeleton staff will remain at the U.S. Embassy, sources said the 
communications sites will be abandoned for the duration of the fighting in 
Liberia, and there is no plan to leave Marines to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, after nightfall in Liberia, a Pentagon spokesman said the 
situation was "in a sense secured," and attention had turned to delivering the 
Americans to Freetown. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marines will remain in Liberia as long as necessary to ensure the safety 
of U.S. citizens in that country," Fitzwater told reporters at the White House 
on Sunday morning. The U.S. action, he added, "does not indicate or constitute 
any intention on the part of the U.S. government to intervene militarily in the 
Liberian conflict." But the Marines understood they were "in a battle 
situation" and were to use any necessary force to complete the evacuation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five key members of Congress were notified of the move about 1 a.m. PDT 
Sunday, an hour before Marines reinforcements went ashore. Word of the 
evacuation also was passed to the embattled Liberian president, who has been 
offered U.S. assistance in leaving the country, and to the two rebel factions. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this operation," Fitzwater said, "is to safeguard lives, to 
draw down the number of Americans at the embassy to minimum staff and to 
provide additional security for those who remain." 
</P>
<P>
About 70 U.S. diplomats and 300 other American citizens have remained in the 
afflicted city since it was cut off from most substantial contact with the 
outside world about a month ago. In that time, Monrovia's power and water 
supplies have been cut and food supplies have dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government and rebel troops have ranged about the city skirmishing 
with each other and engaging in wholesale mayhem. One week ago, a company 
evidently of government troops invaded a city church where thousands of 
civilians had sought shelter and opened fire, killing at least 270 people and 
possibly as many as 600. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had said that the 2,100 Marines on the four American ships off 
the Liberian coast would take no action unless there is a specific threat to 
American citizens or properties in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"The President does not want U.S. troops to go into Liberia and shoot 
Liberians," Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, 
told reporters in Nairobi on Friday. "We do not want to use military force to 
effect a political outcome." 
</P>
<P>
But a threat to American lives materialized Saturday when rebel leader Prince 
Johnson announced that he would begin to arrest American, British, Lebanese and 
Indian citizens in the capital to "create an international incident so foreign 
troops can come in to intervene." Johnson, commander of a rebel force that 
split off from the main rebel body under Charles Taylor in February and that 
has since been fighting soldiers loyal to Doe and Taylor, pledged that the 
detainees would not be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 foreign nationals, mostly Lebanese and Indian merchants, are 
thought to still be in Monrovia. On Sunday, Spain requested the Marines' help 
in getting food and medicine to its embassy in Monrovia, where 100 people have 
taken shelter, and to evacuate those who wished to leave, the Spanish Foreign 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Coming two days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and in the midst of concern 
over a possible move against Saudi Arabian oil fields, the timing of the 
Liberian evacuation raised questions of a possible connection between the U.S. 
response to the two crises. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on the CBS program "Face the Nation," House Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) observed that the situation in Monrovia 
had provided "a marvelous opportunity for George Bush to send a message to 
(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence, added Sen. James Sasser (D-Tenn.), also provided an 
opportunity for the Bush Administration to reassure the American public "at a 
time when we appear helpless in dealing with the situation in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
But the White House insisted that the situation in the Liberian capital was 
justification enough for the action. Besides the threat of arrests of foreign 
nationals Saturday, sporadic gunfire rocked the neighborhood of the U.S. 
Embassy and downtown Monrovia. Fitzwater noted that food shortages have 
intensified in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Bush monitored developments from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., 
where he was also tracking the crisis in the Middle East. His decision to 
proceed with the evacuation was made Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian crisis began last Christmas Eve, when 200 poorly trained and 
lightly armed rebels entered the country from neighboring Ivory Coast under the 
command of Taylor, a former Cabinet minister who had fallen out with Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor professed to have the backing of the Gio and Mano tribes of Liberia, who 
felt they had been shouldered out of power by Doe and his Krahn tribesmen. As 
his troops moved south toward Monrovia, Taylor picked up thousands of 
supporters as the fighting took on the character of an intertribal war. As many 
as 5,000 Liberians, most of them civilians, have died in the fighting and the 
tribal massacres this year. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations that government forces would collapse and Doe would flee as 
Taylor's army approached the coast failed to come true when rebels first 
reached the capital in June. The result has been a prolonged standoff between 
rebels and the government in and around Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the rebel advance has been hampered by the infighting between Taylor 
and Johnson, one of his former allies, who now considers himself a more genuine 
spokesman for Gio and Mano people than Taylor. The two forces have taken time 
off from their assault on Doe's oceanfront mansion to assault each other. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were fighting as a united front, victory for the rebels would be in 
sight," one prominent Liberian exile in New York said in a weekend interview. 
</P>
<P>
But Doe's troops have also shown unexpected mettle, say observers from 
Monrovia, in part because they may fear being slaughtered if the rebels 
prevail. In seesaw, street-by-street fighting over the last two weeks, they 
have managed to push rebel positions back and retake some key strategic targets 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Doe took power as a lowly master sergeant in a bloody 1980 coup that overthrew 
President William Tolbert, a descendant of freed American slaves who founded 
independent Liberia in 1847. Tolbert was killed in the coup, and 13 of his 
ministers were executed on a Monrovia beach a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government supported Doe for years, most conspicuously in 1985, when 
the State Department overtly condoned his manifest theft of the presidential 
election that year. But American support began to wane as his government's 
abuse of human rights mounted, including the jailing of opposition leaders and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has granted Liberia no aid other than humanitarian 
assistance, mostly food deliveries, in three years, a senior U.S. official said 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this year's fighting, the U.S. government has taken pains to appear 
neutral. In part, this reflects mistrust of Taylor, who was arrested in the 
United States, where he fled after the Doe government accused him of embezzling 
nearly $1 million from a ministry under his control, but escaped before he 
could be extradited. Many Liberians consider the charges trumped up. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who declared himself head of an interim Liberian government last week, 
has not pledged to hold democratic elections. He has specifically ruled out the 
participation in his government of any of the opposition political leaders who 
contested the 1985 election and had been preparing for a new election next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear we made a mistake in 1985," one U.S. official said over the 
weekend. "We've given Charles Taylor notice that if he comes to power there 
will be no assistance unless he goes down the right road" -- in other words, 
toward free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Johnson, whose force is thought to include some of the better-trained 
and elite officers of Taylor's original army, is seen by some as a potential 
counterweight to Taylor's more non-democratic instincts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a U.S.-trained former lieutenant in the government army who defected 
in 1985 to a rebel force led by former Doe associate Thomas Qwiwonkpa, who 
staged an abortive coup that year and died in the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
One Liberian who shared quarters with Johnson in 1985 called him a "hardheaded, 
uncompromising" officer who was often disciplined for insubordination. He 
joined Qwiwonkpa, this friend said, "because he was so discontented with the 
fraudulent results of the election." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining factor in the Liberian equation is a possible peacekeeping force 
of African soldiers. Many Liberians would be unnerved if the force were largely 
Nigerian, because Nigerian President Ibrahim B. Babangida has been a generous 
supporter of the Doe regime in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian invasion would not necessarily stop the bloodletting immediately, 
because Taylor has pledged to combat any such force. 
</P>
<P>
But many Liberian observers say that only an international peacekeeping force 
will guarantee an end to the conflict, aggravated as it has been by tribal 
animosity.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Liberia, on the southwest coast of the West African bulge, was founded by freed 
American slaves in 1822 and became Africa's first republic in 1847. The 
population of 2.3 million includes descendants of the slaves -- about 5% of the 
total -- and 16 ethnic groups. A 1980 military coup led by Samuel K. Doe 
installed the first government controlled by indigenous Liberians after decades 
of rule by descendants of the American founders. Doe rose to the presidency and 
has survived attempted assassinations or coups four times.

IRAQ CLAIMS PULLOUT, BUT FEW BELIEVE IT; 
</P>
<P>
PERSIAN GULF: HUSSEIN SAYS MORE TROOPS WILL LEAVE KUWAIT THIS WEEK. OTHERS FIND 
NO EVIDENCE OF A MAJOR WITHDRAWAL.

<P>
Iraq said that it began pulling its troops out of Kuwait on Sunday and promised 
to withdraw more forces Tuesday, but officials outside the Persian Gulf emirate 
said there was no evidence of any significant withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction ranged from skepticism to President Bush's flat accusation that the 
Baghdad government of President Saddam Hussein had "lied once again." 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad Television showed images of tanks being loaded onto flatbed trucks and 
a long line of tanker vehicles, jeeps and trucks said to be headed home from 
Kuwaiti territory. Diplomatic sources in the gulf said that northbound highways 
in southern Kuwait were closed, and motorists were told that the closures were 
to make way for Iraq-bound troops. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement from the Iraqi capital, the official spokesman for Iraq's 
general command gave no estimate of the number of troops claimed to have been 
withdrawn, but he said that the pullout began at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"After military units completed their withdrawal today," the spokesman said, 
"and as security is stable in Kuwait, it has been decided to withdraw other 
units the day after tomorrow, Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad Radio said that people in Iraq's southern Basra province "lined the 
streets to welcome the (returning) soldiers, greeting them with the victory 
sign and cheers for Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
Several government officials and diplomats in the region said there was no 
indication that Hussein had withdrawn any major portion of his 100,000-strong 
invasion force. Some reports said that thousands of troops from Iraq's newly 
designated Kuwaiti "popular" army spread out into the tiny sheikdom throughout 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not seen any evidence that they are pulling out, and my personal belief 
is that they are not," said an official in Cairo with access to intelligence 
reports. "It means for some reason they are considering other alternatives, 
which are legion -- none of them good." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush dismissed the new government set up by Iraq in 
Kuwait as a "puppet regime" and said there was no indication that Iraq's 
four-day-old occupation of its tiny neighbor is nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting international pressure on Iraq to end the invasion, the new 
nine-man military government named by Iraq issued a warning to countries with 
citizens living in Kuwait to carefully consider any sanctions. An estimated 1 
million foreigners are believed to be working in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Countries that resort to punitive measures against the provisional free Kuwait 
government and fraternal Iraq . . . should remember that they have interests 
and nationals in Kuwait," warned the new foreign minister, Walid Saud Mohammed 
Abdullah. "These countries should also not expect us to act honorably at a time 
when they are conspiring against us and our brothers in Iraq in an aggressive 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-installed government also announced that beginning today, it was 
easing a blanket curfew in force since the invasion to allow people to move 
about during daylight hours, Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the first information in several days trickled out of the Kuwaiti 
capital early today from a group of Arab reporters escorted to Kuwait from 
Baghdad by the Hussein government. 
</P>
<P>
According to their reports, most Kuwaiti residents remained huddled in their 
homes, and abandoned cars littered the streets in some areas, some smashed by 
tanks seeking to clear the roadways. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense building 
and a nearby military academy showed signs of heavy fighting, and residents 
reported that while Iraqi troops had overrun the country in a matter of hours, 
scattered gunfire exchanges could still be heard at night. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number killed and injured in the fighting have ranged from 300 
to 800, and reports on Saturday said that invading Iraqi troops had penetrated 
Kuwaiti territory clear to the "neutral zone" on Kuwait's frontier with Saudi 
Arabia. Only a couple of parallel fences spaced about half a mile apart 
reportedly separate the invaders from Saudi Arabian territory at that point. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by Iraq's official news agency, the new Kuwaiti 
government said it planned to initiate immediate negotiations with "sisterly 
Iraq" on such issues as the long-running border dispute between Iraq and Kuwait 
-- one of the contentious issues cited as having provoked Iraq's invasion 
before dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to resolve (these issues) in the interests of ensuring and 
safeguarding the security of Iraq and Kuwait, who together are bound by the 
same fate," said the newly appointed Kuwaiti prime minister, Col. Ala Hussein 
Ali. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, broke a three-day silence 
since he disappeared from the Kuwaiti capital and, sheltered in an undisclosed 
location believed to be in Saudi Arabia, broadcast an appeal over Saudi and 
Bahraini television. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes our hearts filled with sadness is that the source of this 
unjustified aggression was not an enemy, but a brother and a close neighbor to 
whom we have lent our support during his time of difficulty," the sheik said, 
referring to the billions of dollars Kuwait loaned to Iraq to support its 
eight-year war with Iran. "We have suffered a lot as a result of that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Kuwaiti officials, including four members of the Kuwaiti ruling 
family who had been secretly shuttled out of the country, arrived Sunday night 
in London and reported that Iraqi troops had engaged in looting, on occasions 
ordering people out of their cars and taking their money. Various foreign 
embassies in Kuwait have made similar reports. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from Amman, Jordan, acting Kuwaiti Ambassador Faisal Mukhaizem 
said that one or more Kuwaiti F-1 Mirage jets bombed the headquarters of the 
Iraqi military in Jahrah, near the Kuwaiti capital. Mukhaizem said the aircraft 
were among a number of planes that the Kuwaiti government still controls, but 
he declined to say where they are based. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to specify from where those planes took off," he said. "For 
political reasons, and strategic considerations, we would like to protect the 
places where they have taken off from. It could be Bahrain, it could be Saudi 
Arabia, it could be somewhere else. It could be from within Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation of the report, and most diplomatic 
sources were skeptical about it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials did not provide details about why they do not believe Iraq's 
claim that it is withdrawing from Kuwait. White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said there is "no independent or confirmable information" about the 
claim, and he added that Iraqi President Hussein's "actions in the past raise 
serious skepticism about his intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told ABC-TV 
that intelligence reports "do not indicate the Iraqis are moving out, 
especially along the southern border. So if they are taking anybody out, it's 
probably just a few people for show." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's first deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told reporters after a 
meeting with Turkish President Turgut Ozal that the troop withdrawal "will not 
take long. Maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks." The two envoys presumably 
discussed Western requests that Turkey shut down the pipeline through which 
Iraq pumps more than half of its crude oil. Ramadan warned that a Turkish 
decision to shut down the pipeline would "create mistrust" between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's intentions toward Saudi Arabia remained another unanswered question 
Sunday, following the reports that thousands of Iraqi troops have massed near 
Kuwait's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said there was still no evidence of an 
imminent invasion across the Saudi border. Though there were some reports of 
minor cross-border incursions, an official there said: "I have not seen a 
single confirmed report of incursions across the border." 
</P>
<P>
An American oil technician who recently returned from the border region told 
the Associated Press that Saudi Arabia had deployed 200 to 300 tanks toward the 
Kuwaiti border on Friday. But there have been no other reports of Saudi 
military buildups in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein, trying to still fears of further Iraqi expansion, told 
CBS News that Saddam Hussein does not intend to send troops south across the 
desert border into Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the West to stay out of the Persian Gulf crisis, King Hussein 
said: "During the last few days there were pressures applied to bring not only 
the majority of the world in line but to also influence Arab logic. Please 
believe me . . . that intimidation does not work, that it could be 
counterproductive and that we could be in a far worse situation than we are 
facing at the moment."

IRAQ ECONOMIC EMBARGO COULD STIR FULL BLOCKADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mounting international effort to put an economic squeeze on Saddam Hussein 
lowers his Iraqi regime to a status previously held only by Southern Rhodesia 
and raises the possibility that a trade embargo might be enforced with a 
full-fledged blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The collective action for an embargo, amounting to economic warfare, is a rare 
display of unanimity. Further, experts said that it opens the door to even 
bolder steps: possible shutdowns of Iraqi oil pipelines or even a move by U.S. 
naval vessels to block seaborne shipments to or from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that the United States could not consider such 
action until other nations have made known their willingness to join in 
sanctions against Iraq. But with the U.N. Security Council appearing poised to 
make a worldwide embargo mandatory, they said that further steps had become 
more likely. 
</P>
<P>
A well-enforced embargo would impose a potentially devastating burden on Iraq, 
which is highly dependent on its oil revenues and whose spare food supplies are 
insufficient to adequately feed its population, according to experts on the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
"If the pipeline is cut and they can't get commodities into the country, 
they're going to starve," said Judith Kipper, a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts also warned that any embargo, even if backed up with naval might, 
would be slow to take effect, difficult to administer -- and could cost the 
outside world dearly in the form of lower trade revenues and higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very much a two-edged sword," said Alan J. Stoga, managing director of 
Kissinger Associates in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration bid to tighten the economic noose apparently was guaranteed 
Security Council support as China indicated in a closed-door session in New 
York that it would not oppose a resolution calling for a broad embargo on Iraq, 
diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, binding on all 159 member states, would effectively cut all 
trade with Iraq and Kuwait except for humanitarian relief. With the required 
nine-member majority lined up in support, approval is expected as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would mark the first imposition of mandatory economic sanctions by 
the United Nations since similar action against the rebel British colony of 
Southern Rhodesia in 1967. While that move proved of little immediate value, 
experts said Sunday that Iraq is probably more vulnerable to a squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, 90% of Iraq's oil exports depend on foreign ports and 
pipelines. While neither Turkey nor Saudi Arabia, their fingers on the valve, 
has yet been willing to take action, the analysts said that a declaration of 
international embargo might embolden Turkey, at least, to move to stop the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
Absent such actions, an oil embargo would remain subject to violation by 
nations unwilling to submit to higher oil prices. But because Iraqi trade is 
channeled through just three ports, some analysts said Sunday that the new 
international willingness to do without Iraqi oil might provide leeway for the 
United States to enforce the embargo with its naval cordon. 
</P>
<P>
"The only really effective chance that you have of cutting off exports of oil 
from Iraq is to interdict those three points," said House Armed Services 
Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) in a television interview Sunday. "That, I think, 
would have a much better chance of succeeding than an embargo." 
</P>
<P>
But critics warn that such an effort, targeting the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and 
Mediterranean ports on which Iraq relies, would be difficult to enforce and 
ultimately futile because of its impact on worldwide oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very simple matter to establish a blockade," said retired Navy Rear 
Adm. Gene La Rocque, director of the Center for Defense Information. "But to 
make an effective blockade would be difficult if not impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Added James R. Schlesinger, a former secretary of defense and energy, in an 
interview on CBS: "If we had a blockade, then we would see the price of oil 
move up, our European allies would be opposed to us, and the public would be in 
an uproar. I think that the Administration will simply have to give up on this 
particular ambition." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official confirmed Sunday night that the idea of a 
naval blockade is "being discussed" but cautioned that it is "only in the 
context of nothing being ruled out." 
</P>
<P>
However enforced, the new campaign of economic warfare is likely to have its 
most immediate effect on ordinary Iraqi citizens, who have become used to 
readily available foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
What remains a matter of dispute, the analysts said, is whether a shutdown of 
food and other supplies would kindle sufficient domestic discontent, or whether 
Hussein could force the outside world to ease the embargo by forcing Kuwaiti 
civilians to bear its brunt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a race between what the Iraqis will do to the civilians and the 
absolute necessity for the United States to stop this takeover," said Kipper, 
the Brookings scholar.

But with the passing of the Cold War forging unprecedented international unity, 
most analysts expressed cautious optimism about the effect of economic war 
against Iraq.

"If they pass the U.N. resolution," said Kimberley Ann Elliott, a research 
associate at the Institute for International Economics and an expert on 
economic sanctions, "it stands a pretty good chance of being effective."

A'S STEWART WINS HIS DUEL IN SUN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: OAKLAND STARTER OUTPITCHES THE ANGELS' FINLEY, WHO GIVES UP LEADOFF 
HOMER TO RICKEY HENDERSON AND LOSES, 4-1.

<P>
It evolved into a contest of wills, a tense matchup between a pitcher who is 
sure he will win 20 games for a fourth consecutive season and one who hopes he 
will win 20 for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
For seven innings Sunday, Oakland's Dave Stewart gave Chuck Finley and the 
Angels no room to waver, and Finley was no more generous to Stewart and the 
A's. Given so little, the A's still took away from Anaheim Stadium a 4-1 
victory, emphasizing in a dozen different ways the distinctions between 
champions and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching four days after an 11-inning shutout victory over Seattle, Stewart 
sustained a brilliant stretch Sunday by giving the Angels only one unearned run 
in the sixth on an error and Devon White's triple. 
</P>
<P>
Finley was nearly as good, recovering after he yielded a home run to Rickey 
Henderson leading off the game. But he faltered under the pressure applied in 
the eighth by Henderson and the A's. 
</P>
<P>
By giving up only five hits over seven innings, Stewart (15-8) moved a step 
closer to becoming the first pitcher to record four consecutive 20-win seasons 
since Hall of Famer Jim Palmer did so in 1975-78. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets in a game like this one -- and he's had about four or five all 
year -- where you can't blink, you can't flinch or you lose, he's awesome," A's 
Manager Tony La Russa said. "That's two games back to back and you tell me how 
he can do that on three days' rest, twice, first against (Erik) Hanson and now 
against Finley where you just can't flinch." 
</P>
<P>
Finley flinched in the eighth, walking Henderson on a full count. The game's 
third-leading base stealer stole his 920th base and scored on Dave Henderson's 
two-out single, but the A's didn't stop there. Terry Steinbach doubled and Mark 
McGwire deflated the spirits of the 51,597 fans with a two-run single, giving 
the A's a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent our best pitcher out there, they sent their best pitcher out. You knew 
we were going to have a battle today," said Henderson, who extended his own 
record with his 44th home run leading off a game. "We scored off him early and 
Stew shut them down real well. It was tough because Finley's a real tough 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Tough as he is, Finley was not prepared for another loss Sunday. Informed after 
the game that his 8-month old nephew had died of a heart problem in a New 
Orleans hospital, Finley was distraught and did not speak with reporters. He 
will fly today to his hometown of Monroe, La., for the funeral of James Cory 
Cox, the son of his sister, Susan Cox, and her husband, Rodney. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched great. He pitched well enough to win," Angel Manager Doug Rader 
said of Finley. "It was an excellent ballgame. You've got to admire both 
performances. They got a two-out base hit to break it open and that was the 
ballgame. It was a very good ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
And a very satisfying game for Stewart, who moved ahead of Finley and is tied 
with Boston's Roger Clemens for the second-highest victory total in the AL. 
Stewart lowered his earned-run average to 2.58, behind Clemens' 2.14 and 
Finley's 2.40. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I threw the ball pretty well and got outs when I needed them," said 
Stewart, who has won four consecutive games and has given up one earned run 
over 27 innings. "I just wanted to give us a chance to win the ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Nerve-wracking is what it is against a pitcher like Finley. You know Finley is 
going to be in the ballgame from the first out till the last. You hope you 
don't make the first mistake. Fortunately, he made a mistake to Rickey 
Henderson in the first inning. Devon White had an RBI for them in the sixth and 
that was another mistake, but Finley's a great competitor, probably one of the 
best in the league." 
</P>
<P>
But the A's are a team of superb competitors. Henderson excelled at the plate, 
on the basepaths and in left field, crashing into the barrier in the second 
inning to catch a fly ball hit by Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get a better example. That's probably as good as you'll ever see," 
La Russa said. "He hits a home run, makes a run where nobody else could make it 
-- and you don't steal many bases off Finley -- and he plays a nice left field, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, whose league-leading batting average fell a point to .332, said his 
leadoff home run on a 3-and-2 fastball was a nice boost for the A's. "We knew 
there weren't going to be many runs scored," he said. "The name of the game was 
who was going to score first." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, with relief help from Rick Honeycutt and Dennis Eckersley, made sure 
the Angels didn't score most. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to be consistent and give our ballclub what it needed," he 
said. "I've been pitching well but the results just haven't been real good. 
Things are starting to go more in my favor. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty wins never creeps into my mind because I know I'm going to do it. I 
know it. I've done it the past three years and nobody else has. No question, 
I'm going to do that. It's something I expect to do. Basically, it's not a 
matter of if I do it, but when I do it." 
</P>
<P>
The A's have taken eight of 10 games from the Angels this season and are still 
2 1/2 games ahead of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're perfect, but I don't think there's an area where anyone 
can say, 'We can beat that club there,' " La Russa said. "We can improve, but I 
think we're playing pretty well. There's always a way to play better with what 
you've got." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's attendance of 51,597 gave the Angels a record for attendance at a 
four-game series at Anaheim Stadium, with a total of 188,616. The previous 
four-game series record was 173,347, set July 1-4, 1983 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Joe Grahe, who had a chance to win his major league debut Saturday 
against Oakland, didn't mind not getting a decision as long as the Angels won. 
He showed considerable poise after Rickey Henderson walked, stole second, went 
to third on an error and scored the first run before the game was more than a 
few minutes old. "I thought it went OK. I was able to keep us in the game and 
it was a big game for the Angels," said Grahe, who gave up three earned runs in 
5 1/3 innings. "It was kind of a relaxer when Henderson scored. It was, 'OK, 
they got their first run,' that way I didn't have to be anxious about when 
they'd score." 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, on the disabled list with a strained lower back, will be 
re-evaluated Tuesday. He was been hitting from both sides of the plate as well 
as throwing and running and has reported no pain. Wally Joyner (broken right 
kneecap) is progressing slowly. Mark McLemore (sprained right wrist) has been 
hitting, taking grounders and throwing without difficulty. Greg Minton (sore 
left arm) has been throwing lightly. He hopes he has found a cure for his arm 
woes: shaving his mustache. "Maybe if I'm incognito from my elbow it will hurt 
less," he said.

MURRAY STAYS HOT TO KEEP HIS TEAM COOL;

BASEBALL: HIS SECOND HOME RUN GIVES DODGERS THE LEAD BACK AGAINST THE GIANTS. 
GIBSON ALSO HITS TWO HOMERS IN 12-6 VICTORY.

<P>
Eddie Murray has never been so happy to see a strategy backfire. 
</P>
<P>
After the San Francisco Giants overcame his three-run home run in the first 
inning with six runs in the second inning Sunday, the Dodgers' first baseman 
wanted to give his teammates a rest. 
</P>
<P>
While batting with two runners on base and two out in the fourth inning, he was 
hoping only to reach base and keep the Dodgers in the dugout shade. 
</P>
<P>
"The fellas were tired, I was just trying to give them a longer break," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he forced them back to their feet with a second three-run home run, 
leading the Dodgers to a 12-6 victory before 49,005 at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
In gaining a split of this four-game series, the Dodgers benefited from a 
16-hit offense and eight innings of one-run relief pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"This game sure was like a quick roller coaster," Murray said. "We go up, we 
come down, then we go back up again, just like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Games like this are difficult, but they let you know that you always have to 
keep playing, no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson hit two home runs and added an RBI single for the Dodgers in the 
final four innings. Mike Hartley, in relief of starter Tim Belcher, pitched 
five shutout innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting fun now," said Hartley, who has returned from a minor league 
exile to go 3-0 in his past eight appearances with a 1.53 earned-run average 
during that time. "There has been a big difference in the last few weeks -- 
everybody is playing hard and concentrating on every play and just having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"And if it's close, and we can get to Murray, we know we have a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
Murray's first-inning homer, a line drive into the left-field corner against 
rookie starter Rafael Novoa, came after walks to Mike Sharperson and Gibson. 
After Sharperson's single gave the Dodgers a 4-0 lead, the Giants scored their 
six runs against Belcher and relief pitcher Ray Searage in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Murray then hit another long drive against Novoa in the fourth after Stan 
Javier walked, Sharperson singled and Gibson's hustle broke up his potential 
double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing Murray didn't do was break a major league record he shares 
with Mickey Mantle of homering from each side of the plate in 10 games. Murray 
had two late-inning chances to hit a homer batting left-handed, but popped out 
both times. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was thinking about the record, he smiled and said, "A little 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sharperson: "Everybody else was thinking about it and rooting for it, I'll 
tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
Murray has three two-homer games this season, and a team-leading 18 homers. His 
six RBIs, tying a Dodger season high for one game, gives him a team-leading 63. 
</P>
<P>
Murray has seven home runs with 21 RBIs in the last 18 games. During that time 
the third-place Dodgers have gone 11-7 and have gained five games in the 
standings, moving to within eight of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
But don't tell Murray that the three games in Cincinnati beginning Tuesday are 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early for that," Murray said. "Everybody wants to put so much 
emphasis on the games coming up. What if we win those three and lose all the 
rest? They are still just three more games." 
</P>
<P>
But other Dodgers say the three games will be easier to play after a split was 
gained here. In their two victories, the Dodgers outscored the Giants, 23-8, 
while in their two losses they were outscored, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not let the Giants take three out of four, especially the way we 
lost," said Sharperson, who had three hits Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed something to get our confidence back. We know now we can go into 
Cincinnati and not lay down. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Reds are going to beat us, they are going to have to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher started at third base for the Dodgers, his first start since 
June 26, and only his fourth start at third base this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it because every time I put him in there, something good seems to 
happen," said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hatcher had only one hit in four at-bats, it was a single that landed 
him on second base when his hustle forced left fielder Kevin Mitchell into an 
error. The first-inning play set the game's tone. 
</P>
<P>
"Four weeks ago, who would have thought we'd be in this position?" Hatcher 
asked. "This shows you, anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher can attest to that. Murray rescued him from his second consecutive loss 
after he gave up four runs on five hits in one inning-plus, his shortest outing 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad stuff, bad pitches," said Belcher, whose ERA rose to 3.81, third-highest 
among the four regular Dodger starters. "But I had a feeling I would spit the 
hook (not take the loss) because the other guy (Novoa) was not pitching that 
good either. His shower was running in the first inning, too. He just used up 
more hot water than I did." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
If the series with the Reds began today, Dodger relief pitcher Jay Howell would 
not be available. His left knee was still swollen Sunday, and many doubt that 
the swelling will subside by Tuesday's series opener in Cincinnati. Tim Crews 
and Jim Gott could be moved into the stopper role for the three games. "It's a 
big series, I'm doing everything I can to get ready for it," said Howell, who 
has not thrown since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel took batting practice for the first time since suffering a sprained 
left ankle last Monday, and said that it still hurts him to move laterally. He 
is doubtful for at least the opener in Cincinnati. . . . Lenny Harris, who 
replaces Samuel at second base against right-handed pitchers, turned his right 
ankle on second base while attempting to turn a double play in the ninth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson hit two homers in a game for the first time since July 14, 1988. . 
. . Mike Hartley has impressed the Dodgers as a possible fifth starter.

A TWIST TO EDBERG VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: HE STAYS BACK AFTER INJURING ANKLE, BUT STILL BEATS CHANG IN THIRD-SET 
TIEBREAKER.

<P>
In Sunday's final of the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament, Stefan Edberg won by a 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he won by an ankle, the one he twisted in the second set of his match 
against Michael Chang and quickly propelled him into a classic limping 
imitation of Festus on "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
And somehow Edberg prevailed, scoring a 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 7-6 (7-3) victory over 
a slightly befuddled Michael Chang, who watched Edberg smile wryly and look to 
the sky as the match ended. 
</P>
<P>
The message? 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to believe that I won," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang couldn't believe what Edberg had become . . . a baseliner. 
Unable to play his normal serve-and-volley game because he could no longer move 
forward, Edberg stayed back and slugged from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he had learned a lesson: "Don't play Stefan Edberg when he twists 
his ankle." 
</P>
<P>
Also having trouble trusting his eyes as he saw the result was Tony Pickard, 
Edberg's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ridiculous, really," said Pickard, who now has come up with a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to break both his ankles for the U.S. Open." 
</P>
<P>
Just like his ankle, Edberg's game took a strange twist. The ankle twist 
happened in the second set with Chang serving at 3-2. Edberg ran laterally 
along the baseline, planted his left foot and then leaned the other way. Edberg 
rolled his ankle to the inside. 
</P>
<P>
He limped around for a while, lost that game, lost his serve at love and then 
walked stiffly to his chair, where trainer Bill Norris examined his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Chang sat in his chair and wondered if Edberg would be able to continue. 
Afterward, Chang was asked whether he thought Edberg might quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping," Chang joked. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg junked the rest of the set, summoned Norris again to get his ankle taped 
and formulated new strategy. It would be dramatic stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The most feared volley in tennis? Forget it. Edberg stayed at the back of the 
court as if he were painted on the baseline and began spraying winners into the 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said an eerie feeling came over him. "I got very relaxed," he said. "You 
don't care, you just go for it. I could have stopped. I was thinking about it. 
It was just so hard to believe. I mean, I don't play my game and look. 
</P>
<P>
"I was almost enjoying it more than normal, which was strange. That's what 
happens when you have an injury. It takes a lot of the pressure off, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg had handled the pressure in the first set, when he rallied to win after 
Chang took a 5-2 lead. Edberg only got better in the third set, hitting 19 of 
his 43 winners. Chang knew how Edberg was feeling then, but there was not much 
he could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have that frame of mind, you just go for your shots, you're just 
relaxed," Chang said. "I've felt that way before when I had cramps. The winning 
and losing fades out there." 
</P>
<P>
In the third-set tiebreaker, Chang took the first point, but Edberg won four in 
a row, the last on a 99-mile-an-hour ace. Edberg even changed tactics again, 
trying to end the points quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's artful backhand first volley dipped into the corner for 5-3, then 
tucked a forehand volley into the other corner. Chang reached it, but couldn't 
handle it to set up match point. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 hours 28 minutes, Chang ended the match at the baseline where he put a 
forehand into the net. He shook hands with Edberg at the net and soon received 
his runner-up check of $19,090. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played pretty well," Chang said. "It's just that I've never seen 
Stefan play that well from the back before." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg feigned indignation when asked about his new style of play: "I can play 
from the baseline if I want to." 
</P>
<P>
He soon will find out if he will play in the ATP Championship in Cincinnati, 
which begins today. It's all up to his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
If it's possible, he may find a salve in the winner's check of $32,500, which 
goes nicely with his appearance fee. The sum is undisclosed, but is believed to 
be less than the reported $150,000 Andre Agassi received for playing Volvo/San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's fourth victory of the season -- his first Volvo/Los Angeles title 
after three runner-up finishes -- moved him closer to Ivan Lendl's No. 1 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
With a Wimbledon triumph already packed away, Edberg said he is having his best 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not over yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All that was left was for Chang to think about how he might have evened things 
up with Edberg. "It would have been interesting if I had cramped." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded doubles team of Scott Davis and David Pate won their first 
tournament of the year, defeating Peter Lundgren and Paul Wekesa, 3-6, 6-1, 
6-3.

A COUNTRY MAKES BASEBALL COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: ONCE THE GAME WAS PLAYED WELL THERE, BUT WAR AND POLITICS 
INTERVENED. WITH THE WAR OVER, THE NATION AND THE GAME ARE REBUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Several years ago, at the height of the Nicaraguan contra war, a story began 
making the rounds in Managua about a clash between government troops and 
U.S.-backed rebels. Seems that, during one of the infrequent breaks in the 
fighting, a Sandinista army patrol surprised a group of guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
With a cease-fire in effect, the two armies marked off an open field and 
decided to settle their differences by playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The story is probably apocryphal, but that many believed it demonstrates the 
importance Nicaraguans put on baseball. In a divided country, where emotions 
often run as high as the temperature, baseball is a common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball unifies Nicaragua," said Emmett Lang, president of the country's 
amateur baseball federation and a former director of Nicaragua's Institute of 
Sport. "Baseball is the passion of the people. They love to play baseball; they 
love to watch baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as the decade-long contra war drained the country of resources and 
manpower, and the U.S. economic embargo cut the nation off from its primary 
source of baseball equipment, the level of play in Nicaragua dropped 
dramatically. Now, however, the country may be poised for a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last February's national elections, which brought an end to 10 
years of Sandinista rule, the U.S. has ended both the contra war and the 
embargo, and baseball appears to be among the first of the beneficiaries. In 
May, the San Francisco Giants signed two players and, a day later, the Montreal 
Expos signed three more -- the first Nicaraguans permitted to sign professional 
contracts in more than 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Giants, as part of a joint venture with the municipal 
government of Leon, are researching plans to build a baseball academy in 
Nicaragua. Rough blueprints have been drawn, and a delegation of front-office 
people from the Giant organization are expected to make an on-site inspection 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of raw material, good raw material, in Nicaragua, but they don't 
have the right trainers," said Santos Soto, a Nicaraguan businessman based in 
San Francisco. Soto, along with Julio Gonzales, the Giants' Nicaraguan-born 
radio announcer, helped the team make contacts in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"If this thing goes forward, baseball in Nicaragua will go forward," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
But the development of Nicaraguan players will not come cheaply for major 
league teams. After watching foreign interests harvest from its rain forests 
and gold mines for decades, Nicaragua isn't about to let another treasured 
natural resource -- its baseball players -- go for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"What Nicaragua doesn't want is for a team to go in there, take a player away 
and not give anything in return," Soto said. "Nicaragua is going to benefit if 
the Giants go forward with the academy. They (the Giants) are going to develop 
the players, and they are going to develop the trainers." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and '60s, big league teams played a major role in developing 
Nicaragua's baseball talent. The Nicaraguan First Division was a popular 
alternative to the Caribbean winter leagues, and U.S. players such as Marv 
Throneberry and Steve Boros played there, honing their skills and teaching the 
Nicaraguans. 
</P>
<P>
But in the late '60s, the bottom fell out of the international cotton market, 
devastating one of Nicaragua's major export crops. The economic crunch prompted 
the government to withdraw its funding for baseball, and, as a result, the 
Nicaraguan Winter League died. U.S. major leagues sent their players to 
Venezuela, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Amateur baseball, however, thrived in Nicaragua, and in 1972, La Seleccion 
Nacional, the country's national team, won the world championship. Before the 
end of the decade, four players had signed with major league organizations. 
Outfielder David Green joined St. Louis and pitchers Dennis Martinez, Al 
Williams and Porfirio Altamirano signed with Baltimore, Minnesota and 
Philadelphia, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But the overthrow of the Somoza government in 1979 changed Nicaraguan society 
-- including baseball -- radically. Officials appointed under the new 
government, such as Lang and Carlos Cuadra, a former director of Nicaraguan 
baseball, turned the national baseball program in a new direction, diverting 
resources from the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra, 33, thought the old approach elitist, because it concentrated on only 
about 30 players at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"Once those boys got older, who came along to replace them? No one," Cuadra 
said. Instead, he hoped to make baseball a mass-participation sport. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Institute of Sport, a cabinet-level ministry under the 
Sandinistas, began stressing quantity over quality, with mixed results. Lang 
points with pride to the nearly 300 organized teams for farmers and youngsters 
as one effect of the revolution. Another, however, has been a dismal record in 
international competition, including a 19-2 loss to Japan in the 1984 Olympics 
and an 18-0 drubbing by the United States in the 1987 Pan-American Games. 
</P>
<P>
And by 1988, the 10-team Nicaraguan First Division, once compared favorably to 
triple-A ball in the U.S., had sunk to Class A level. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the Sandinistas just did not want any professional players," 
Soto said. "There was no secret about that. They abolished professional boxing, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
So major league baseball stayed away. At one point, the Toronto Blue Jays 
smuggled a player out, but Brant Jose Alyea never advanced beyond the minors 
and reportedly wound up in the Mexican League. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I heard, they just wouldn't let the players out," said Scott Asher 
of the Giants' minor league operation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for every hurdle erected by the Sandinistas, there was another built by the 
major league teams themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my people not to go into Nicaragua . . . . when there were problems. I 
just told my people to stay out of danger," Frank Wren of the Expos said. "I 
don't know of any roadblocks other than the ones we set up ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Added Terry Reynolds, assistant director of scouting for the Dodgers: "My 
feeling is that the time just wasn't right in the last few years," 
</P>
<P>
Now the Sandinistas are out of power. And although the new government has 
stripped the Institute of Sport (IDN) of its cabinet-level status, it is hoping 
to reinvigorate the national program with new funding and new thinking. 
Although Lang remains head of the Nicaragua Olympic Committee and intends to 
fulfill the final three years of his term as president of the Nicaraguan 
Amateur Baseball Federation, federation founder Carlos Garcia, who spent five 
years in a Sandinista jail, has returned to take a high-level position with the 
IDN. 
</P>
<P>
That's almost certain to hasten the return of professional baseball in some 
form, and it's clear the Nicaraguans are counting on massive support from major 
league organizations to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' signing of brothers Harold and Donald Herdocia last May might have 
been the first step toward normalizing relations between Nicaragua and major 
league baseball. Harold, 19 last month , is considered the better prospect. A 
first baseman, he was Nicaragua's First Division rookie of the year last winter 
and is the nephew of Julio Medina, recently voted the country's player of the 
decade for the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the Herdocias signed, the Expos signed pitcher Felix Moya and two 
other players from the English-speaking Caribbean side of the country, the 
region that produced Stanley Cayaso and Eduardo Green, regarded as the best 
players in Nicaraguan history. 
</P>
<P>
But for Lang, 42, a former Sandinista official who directed the air force 
before moving into the IDN, the signings amounted to a small-scale invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of the best players in the country signed, and now they're gone and we 
have nothing," he said. "A player is like the product of a society. The society 
sacrifices and works to produce a player, then the people can't enjoy this 
player's performance because he's no longer in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lang supports the Giants' proposed baseball academy, which will be 
modeled after major league facilities in the Dominican Republic. Lang has 
visited the Dodgers' Dominican facility in Campo Las Palmas, which was carved 
out of a sugar plantation, and was impressed. But more important, he came away 
convinced that the facility served the community as well as the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
It's that kind of reciprocity he hopes to see from the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"If they give something back, then it's OK," Lang said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the Dominican Republic, the talent level in Nicaragua is limited 
and, for most clubs, that would seem to make the construction of elaborate 
facilities a losing proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (Nicaragua) is the next horizon by any means," said Montreal's 
Wren. "It's a very limited market. In places like Panama or Nicaragua, if you 
get one player every five years, that's about all you can hope to get out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of that, the Giants are not likely to limit enrollment at their 
academy to Nicaraguans. Major league teams are limited to 23 "visa slots" each 
year, meaning they can bring 23 foreign-born players not on their 40-man roster 
to the United States for training and development. Some clubs, such as the 
Giants, save the majority of their visa slots for Puerto Rican and Dominican 
players who come to Arizona for spring training, then return to developmental 
leagues in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The Herdocia brothers, for example, were assigned to Ingenio Provernir, a team 
that plays in the San Pedro de Macoris Division of the Dominican league. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of another training and development facility in Latin America, 
along with access to the Nicaraguan First Division, would allow the Giants to 
sign more players from Mexico and Central America without overcrowding their 
Dominican operation or violating the visa slot agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an interest in researching the prospect of setting up something in 
Nicaragua similar to what we have in the Dominican," Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, whose Dodgers recently completed an agreement to open a development 
facility in Australia, sees value in the Giants' expansion -- especially if the 
Cold War thaw spreads to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"All baseball is looking and hoping that will happen, and you do need a place, 
a base of operations, where you send players and evaluate them without using up 
one of your slots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Asher: "If that country opened up, you would see people fighting hand 
over fist to get in."

ICE HOCKEY: SOVIET UNION, WHICH BEAT THE AMERICANS, 10-1, IN THE PRELIMINARY 
ROUND, NEEDS A PENALTY-SHOT SHOOTOUT TO WIN GOLD-MEDAL GAME, 4-3.

<P>
The Soviet Union needed a penalty-shot shootout to beat the United States, 4-3, 
at the Tacoma Dome and win the Goodwill Games hockey gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the closest the Americans have come to beating a Soviet national team in 
an international event since 1980 and the Miracle on Ice in the Lake Placid 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The United States led, 3-2, in the final minute, but Valeri Kamensky sent the 
game into overtime with his third goal with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
In the shootout used for the Goodwill Games after a scoreless 10-minute 
overtime, the Soviets outscored the U.S. team, 2-0, through four shots. 
Alexander Semak and Dimitri Khristich beat goaltender Guy Hebert, who made four 
saves to preserve the shootout win over Canada Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans were trying to protect their slim lead late in the third period 
when Kamensky took a cross-ice pass and fired a slap shot past Hebert to 
complete his hat trick. Both teams were down a man. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets stepped up offensive pressure in the overtime, taking the kind of 
clear, hard shots on goal largely denied them in regulation. Several 
spectacular saves by Hebert prevented a score. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union had scored first on a goal by Kamensky 4:29 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Americans, routed, 10-1, by the Soviets in the preliminary round, 
played tough defense, seldom allowing the Soviets a clear shot at Hebert. The 
Soviets had 36 shots in regulation to just 17 by the United States, but few of 
the shots were from close-range. 
</P>
<P>
The United States bounced back in the second period, scoring twice in quick 
succession, to the delight of a capacity crowd of 17,442, which chanted 
"U.S.A., U.S.A.!" waved American flags and booed loudly at every perceived 
Soviet infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Sweeney's slapshot after he was fed the puck from the corner behind the 
Soviet net tied the game at 6:23. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute later, David Emma of Boston College passed to C.J. Young of 
Harvard, whose shot from in front of the net got past goaltender Artur Irbe. 
</P>
<P>
With both teams short a man, Kamensky tied it 2-2 at 15:09, taking the puck 
down the ice and firing it past Hebert from the left. 
</P>
<P>
But 33 seconds later, Emma beat the Soviet defenders down the middle of the ice 
after blocking a shot and beat Irbe at short range.

DE LA HOYA, GRIFFIN FINISH WITH GOLDEN FLOURISHES

<P>
Oscar de la Hoya and Eric Griffin were just doing their thing, which in this 
case meant winning another fight. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, a 106-pounder from Broussard, La., capped his run through the Goodwill 
Games boxing competition Sunday by winning the gold medal with a 5-0 victory 
over Anatoli Filippov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya, a teen-ager from East Los Angeles, also was impressive as he won a 
gold medal in an all-American final at 125 pounds. It helped the U.S. team end 
up with a surprisingly strong showing by winning four gold medals, one less 
than the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'm bragging or trying to show off, but I am unbeatable," said 
Griffin, who has been just that for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin hasn't lost since dropping a decision to current International Boxing 
Federation light-flyweight champion Michael Carbajal in the 1988 Olympic 
trials, dominated Filippov, as he had done with his two previous tournament 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In the final round, he hurt the Soviet with right-left combinations, and piled 
up points with inside flurries. 
</P>
<P>
As impressive as Griffin was, he may have been overshadowed by De la Hoya, who 
beat Ivan Robinson, 4-1, in a rousing fight that had the crowd of 8,576 at the 
Seattle Center Arena on its feet cheering both boxers. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old De la Hoya, the youngest fighter in the tournament, also may 
have been its best in his first major international competition. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my biggest win ever," said De la Hoya, who will be a senior at 
Garfield High in September. "To be only 17 and win this, it's just great."

FOUR POSITIVE DRUG TESTS FOUND

Four of 493 drug tests at the Goodwill Games were positive, two for 
over-the-counter drugs and two for unspecified substances, officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 587 tests scheduled to be conducted, 493 from 18 sports had been 
analyzed through Saturday, said Baaron Pittenger, co-chairman of the 
Soviet-American Joint Commission Against Doping in Sport. 
</P>
<P>
But Pittenger declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the national governing bodies that there would be no announcement on 
results," Pittenger said. "But we felt the aggregate results were so pleasing 
that we made this announcement." 
</P>
<P>
The drug testing was conducted by the U.S. Olympic Committee after Turner 
Broadcasting, which sponsored the games, refused to handle the procedures. It 
cost the USOC about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"From my experience," said Don Catlin, head of the IOC-accredited laboratory at 
UCLA, which analyzed the tests, "the lab results show a significant decline in 
the use of various banned drugs from what we have seen previously."

The U.S. women's basketball team was in control throughout the game en route to 
an 82-70 victory over the Soviet Union Sunday in the gold-medal game of the 
Goodwill Games at the Seattle Center Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans went on a 16-1 run in the second half and led by as many as 25 
points. They didn't score in the final three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The victory extended the U.S. women's international winning streak to 41 games, 
and the team gathered at midcourt to rap out the squad's history for the TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won all the things we can possibly win, but that's not enough for us. We 
want to win it again," went the rap song, led by Cynthia Cooper, a former USC 
standout. 
</P>
<P>
The United States already had beaten the Soviet Union, 86-78, in the first 
round and advanced to the gold-medal game with a 106-67 victory over Bulgaria. 
The Soviets shot only 35% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was a real defensive statement for us," U.S. Coach Theresa Grentz 
said. "That was the key. We wanted to keep them from penetrating in the middle. 
It caused some problems for the Soviets and opened up some rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
After leading, 43-33, at halftime, the Americans went on a 16-1 run to lead 
69-45 with 9:36 remaining. They took their biggest lead of the game, 80-55, on 
a jump shot by Sonja Henning with 5:28 to play. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last basket the U.S. team scored. Tammy Jackson made two free 
throws with 3:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty of the United States' 40 rebounds came on the defensive end of the 
floor, 11 of them by Katrina McClain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my strong point," said McClain, who scored 15 points and had 14 
rebounds. "I like to think I can dominate a game on the boards."

A LONG AFTERNOON FOR TEAM CHANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS EICHELBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Chang arrived for the final of the Volvo/Los Angeles tennis tournament 
Sunday, three hours before his match against Stefan Edberg, surrounded by his 
usual entourage -- parents Joe and Betty and older brother Carl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Michael's tennis success, the Changs have remained a private family, 
shying away from interviews, revealing only bits and pieces of the family 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Chang, who works in the marketing division of Unocal, is on leave until 
September to travel with and coach his son. Betty, who quit her job as a 
research chemist two years ago, travels with Michael full time. 
</P>
<P>
An hour and a half before the championship match, which Chang eventually lost, 
7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 7-6 (7-3), Michael, Carl and Joe began the warmup ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Michael serves, Carl returns, Dad mills around the court observing Michael's 
feet, his toss, his follow-through. 
</P>
<P>
The first 20 to 30 serves are either deep or fall at the net. But slowly, as 
Joe begins nodding, the serves find their target, the speed and accuracy 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Not a handful of words have been spoken by the time they leave, each prepared 
in his own way to face Edberg an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
The Changs take their tennis seriously. Even after Chang took a 5-2 lead in the 
first set, then allowed Edberg to tie the set and win the tiebreaker, 7-4, the 
Changs sat straight-faced, rarely speaking even during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Chang led, 3-2, when Edberg twisted his ankle. When play 
resumed, Chang quickly finished the set, prolonging his chances of winning a 
tournament in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Chang nor Edberg were broken through the first 12 games of the final 
set, but Edberg had Chang on the defensive through the tiebreaker, and ended 
it, 7-3, when Chang's forehand fell into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played very well in the third set," Chang said. "I just went out 
there and tried my best. It's always nice to play a tournament in front of the 
home crowd who supports you and cheers for you. It kind of reminded me of the 
juniors." 
</P>
<P>
Said his father: "Michael had chances but couldn't close it. I think he played 
tentatively, but another year or two of experience will help that." 
</P>
<P>
Michael played doubles two weeks ago with his brother in Washington, and said 
that after Carl graduates in May, they might team on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in another year or so, if I can keep up with him," the 1989 French Open 
champion joked.

UNSER JR. WINS FASTEST 500-MILE RACE EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Al Unser Jr. out-raced and had more luck than teammate Bobby Rahal on Sunday to 
win the fastest 500-mile race in history, the Marlboro 500 at Michigan 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Unser and several competitors drove laps in the 224-m.p.h. range, and he won 
$172,684 for averaging 189.727 m.p.h. despite eight caution periods. That was 
faster than the previous 500-mile mark of 186.288 set by stock-car star Bill 
Elliott at Talladega in May 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It easily outdid the Indy-car mark of 185.981 by Arie Luyendyk in May in the 
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's fast enough," Unser, 27, said. "I think we can go 
quicker." 
</P>
<P>
It was Unser's first 500-mile victory, second victory in a row, fourth this 
season and 13th of his career. He dedicated the race to his father, a four-time 
Indy 500 winner who is recovering from injuries sustained here Thursday in a 
crash during practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in bed last night, hoping we could do this," Unser Jr. said. "This 
was for you, dad. I wish you were here." 
</P>
<P>
Rahal, who lost his chance at victory when Unser made his final fuel stop 
during the final caution period, finished second for the fifth time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Engine problems eliminated several top challengers, including Luyendyk, 
pole-winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who dominated the first half of the race, 
Michael Andretti and Rick Mears. 
</P>
<P>
Unser took the lead on a restart on lap 212 following the seventh caution 
period. Rahal regained the top spot on lap 216, lost it to Unser on 218, got it 
back on 219 and lost it to Unser for the final time on lap 235, just 16 laps 
from the end, when Rahal pitted for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, estimated at 55,000, was on its feet and screaming when Rahal drove 
onto pit road and took just 12.1 seconds to head back toward the track, a bit 
more than 31 seconds behind his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Unser was ready for his fuel stop, rookie Jon Beekhuis blew his engine, 
bringing out the final caution period on lap 240. 
</P>
<P>
Unser managed to overtake Rahal before the two reached the flag stand, putting 
a lap on Rahal and making it virtually impossible for him to win the race. He 
won by 25.459 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Andretti, Michael's father and teammate, finished third, a lap behind. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Earnhardt led every lap in a victory at Michigan International Speedway 
that brought him the championship of the International Race of Champions 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, from NASCAR, fought off challenges from fellow Winston Cup drivers 
Mark Martin and Terry Labonte, as well as two-time IROC champion and CART 
Indy-car star Al Unser Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Brundle of England, a road-racing specialist who came into the third and 
final IROC event of the season leading both Earnhardt and Unser by two points 
in the standings, fell from the lead at the start and lost a lap when he spun 
off the two-mile, high-banked oval on the 31st of 50 laps. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, who also won the IROC opener in May on the high banks at Talladega 
and finished fifth in the road race last month at Cleveland, wound up the 
series with 60 points and the winner's share of $175,000. He averaged 153.316 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Ormsby spoiled Chris Karamesines' chances of becoming the oldest Top Fuel 
driver in history to win a NHRA Winston Series event by winning the Northwest 
Nationals at Seattle International Raceway in Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Karamesines, 61, was appearing in his second final of the year. He lost to 
Ormsby at the Grandnational in Montreal in June. This time, Ormsby's Castrol 
GTX dragster covered the quarter-mile in 5.098 seconds at 282.39 m.p.h. 
Karamesines's chances ended when his dragster's engine exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Glidden earned his first Pro Stock title in six months, his 78th overall 
and second of the season. He drove his Motorcraft Ford Probe past Mark Pawuk's 
Oldsmobile in the finals, 7.388 at 187.14 m.p.h. to 7.435 at 185.18. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Oswald, driving a Ford Probe, got his second 1990 Funny Car victory, 
running 5.401 seconds at 275.98 m.p.h., while Ed McCulloch's Oldsmobile 
trailed, 5.492 at 261.55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Schwantz of Paige, Tex., edged world leader Wayne Rainey of Downey to win 
the British 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle race at Castle Donington, England. 
</P>
<P>
Starting the race 30 points behind Rainey, Schwantz, on a Suzuki, won by two 
seconds with former world champion Eddie Lawson of Upland, third. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey, riding a Yamaha, still has a 27-point lead in the overall standings 
with four races left.

KITE'S PLAYOFF WIN PUTS EARNINGS AT $6 MILLION

<P>
Tom Kite rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole Sunday to 
defeat John Cook in the St. Jude tournament at Memphis, Tenn., and become the 
PGA Tour's first $6-million man. 
</P>
<P>
Kite hit a seven-iron to the green on the 13th hole, the first of sudden death, 
but Cook's approach landed in a bunker. Kite needed one putt for his first tour 
win of the year and the 14th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I take the attitude in a playoff that you have to deliver the first blow," 
Kite said. "I was 146 yards from the hole and I was going right at it. You 
can't count on someone making a mistake on a playoff hole. You've got to go for 
the birdie." 
</P>
<P>
The first prize of $180,000 pushed Kite's career earnings to $6,144,890. Cook, 
winless since 1987, earned $108,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were tied for the lead when the round began at the 7,006-yard, par-71 
TPC course at Southwind. However, Cook ran off four birdies in a row starting 
at the 12th hole to pick up five strokes on Kite and lead by one. Kite birdied 
the par-three 17th to tie Cook at 67 for the round and 15-under 269 for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
David Canipe shot a steady round of 69 to finish third at 12-under 272. David 
Frost, Tim Simpson and Bob Estes were tied for fourth at 274. 
</P>
<P>
Barb Mucha, who failed to qualify for the 1988 tour after playing in 1987, won 
her first LPGA tournament when she birdied the second playoff hole to beat 
Lenore Rittenhouse in the Boston Five Classic at Danvers, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
As she had promised Saturday, Mucha celebrated winning the $52,500 first prize 
by jumping into the pond alongside the 18th fairway of the 6,008-yard Tara 
Ferncroft course. 
</P>
<P>
Mucha and Rittenhouse had finished 72 holes at 11-under-par 277, setting up the 
first playoff in the 11-year history of the tournament. Rittenhouse shot 65 and 
Mucha had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Rarick finished third, shooting 66 for 278. Defending champion Amy Alcott 
and first-day leader Ok-Hee Ku, who double-bogeyed the 18th, tied at 280. 
Alcott had a 69 Sunday and Ku shot 70. Nancy Brown and Laura Baugh tied at 281. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Crampton shot a final-round 68 to win the Senior Tour's Paine Webber 
Invitational at Charlotte, N.C., in just his third tournament since returning 
from a lengthy layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton, who missed 11 weeks for a stress-related illness, pulled away from a 
pack of 21 golfers within one stroke of the lead when the day began. He won 
$67,500. 
</P>
<P>
Tied with Tom Shaw at 10-under, Crampton birdied the 16th hole by two-putting 
from 70 feet for birdie, moving to the eventual winning total of 11-under 205. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, who surged into contention with a second-round 65, finished one shot back 
with a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Alfredsson, last year's European rookie of the year, won a sudden-death 
playoff with a par on the fourth hole against Zimbabwe's Jane Hill to take the 
British Women's Open at Woburn England. 
</P>
<P>
The two were tied at four-under-par 288 after Hill matched the tournament 
record with a final-round 68. Alfredsson shot 73 and needed the playoff for her 
first tournament win. 
</P>
<P>
Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland shot a 69 for a wire-to-wire, four-stroke 
victory in the PLM Open at Malmo, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Rafferty had an 18-under-par total of 270, a tournament record. Vijay Singh of 
Fiji was second at 274 after shooting 65. Former Masters champion Bernhard 
Langer of West Germany was one more stroke behind. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples, the only U.S. tour member who made the cut, also closed with a 65 
to share fourth with Sweden's Ove Sellberg at 276.

NEWSWIRE: MIAMI GROUP WANTS EXPOS, OFFERS $117 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montreal Expo owner Charles Bronfman has been offered $117.4 million for the 
team by a Miami group, $30 million more than his asking price, but he is 
continuing to search for a local buyer, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Gazette reported Sunday that a Miami group is willing to make a 
$30.4-million down payment on the team, which would move to Miami as soon as 
construction on a new stadium is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Bronfman has said that he wants to sell the team for about $87 million, but 
would prefer to sell the franchise to a person or group who would keep the team 
in Montreal. He has set an Aug. 31 deadline for offers from local groups. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Brochu, the Expo president who has been given the job of finding a 
buyer, said Saturday: "You've got a lot of agents and people involved in 
something like this. It seems like everyone's come out of the woodwork, and 
that includes people who just want to make a quick buck."

TIGHT SPOT WINS BY A NOSE, ALLOWS TRAINER MCANALLY TO FORGET DEFEAT

<P>
The weekend turned out all right for Ron McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
The day after Bayakoa was upset by Quiet American in the San Diego Handicap, 
Tight Spot put McAnally in the winner's circle Sunday with a narrow victory 
over favored Itsallgreektome in the $107,600 La Jolla Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden perfectly by Eddie Delahoussaye, the 3-year-old His Majesty colt tracked 
pacesetter Forest Glow most of the way, drew clear into the stretch, then held 
off the 9-5 choice to win by a nose in 1:41 4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth victory in 11 starts for the 2-1 second choice, but he is 
unbeaten in two tries on the grass. He is bred for success on turf -- his dam, 
Premium Win, is by Lyphard -- and he had worked well over the surface last 
winter at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a different horse on the turf," McAnally said. "I told Eddie I figured 
he'd be laying second. I was happy with how he rode him, but the margin was 
getting shorter and shorter at the wire. I thought (Itsallgreektome) was the 
one to beat. This takes a little of the sting out of Bayakoa's loss." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, those sentiments were shared by Frank and Jan Whitham. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa's owners own Tight Spot in partnership with Verne Winchell, Rick 
Corradini and Frank Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye, who has been aboard Tight Spot for three of his four lifetime 
victories, said the margin would have been a bit more decisive if not for an 
incident in the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke running and I had just gotten him to relax when he jumped on me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a spot where the grass is cut shorter and, when he saw it, he bobbled. 
It cost me about a length because he went from a half-length behind (Forest 
Glow) to a length and a half behind. You can't afford to be giving away lengths 
with horses like this. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he would have won a lot easier if that hadn't happened. But, it all 
turned out OK. He took off when I asked him. He really got in gear and I really 
got after him in the stretch because he tends to want to pull up when he gets 
to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I'd won it or not. The other horse was outside and I had my 
head down, but he hung on." 
</P>
<P>
With Tight Spot and Silver Ending, McAnally is sitting pretty for the Del Mar 
Derby Aug. 19,but Delahoussaye has a choice to make between the two. 
</P>
<P>
He rode the latter for the first time in the Swaps when Silver Ending was 
second to Jovial. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they'll get in each other's way," said McAnally. "Tight Spot has 
speed and Silver Ending is a closer." 
</P>
<P>
Tight Spot paid $6.60 to win and the $62,100 payday pushed his earnings to 
$229,550. 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome, who won the Spotlight and Will Rogers at Hollywood Park, was 
four lengths clear of Music Prospector, the 2-1 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
Green's Leader, Forest Glow and Barton Dene completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming down the stretch, I thought I was going to catch the leader," said 
Julio Garcia, who rode Itsallgreektome for the first time, replacing the 
injured Corey Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in the last jump, I knew I had just missed him. My horse tried his best. 
He ran a good race." 
</P>
<P>
Making his first U.S. turf start, Music Prospector was never a factor, but Gary 
Stevens thinks he could be heard from in the Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran a good race," he said. "I let him settle too much coming away from (the 
gate) and the slow pace hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was coming on and he ran a big race to run third. He (trainer Steve Miyadi) 
asked me about the Derby and I told him to go ahead and run him back because it 
could set up a little better for him. The extra distance, a bigger field and a 
better pace up front could make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis, who injured his back while pulling up a horse a week ago today, 
is receiving daily therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's lumbar displacement," said Jeff Franklin, Davis' agent. "On Friday, his 
back looked like Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"But, his condition has improved with the therapy. Dr. (Robert) Kerlan 
recommended a sports therapist at Scripps La Jolla he's been working with. It's 
a day-to-day thing." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of Bayakoa, McAnally said all was well with the champion mare 
the morning after Quiet American beat her by 2 1/4 lengths while carrying seven 
fewer pounds (122-115). 
</P>
<P>
"She got beat," said McAnally, who will leave for Saratoga today for his 
induction into the Hall of Fame Thursday. "The weight difference didn't help 
her any. The horse that beat her was one of the choices in the Santa Anita 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"On the scale, she gave him 12 pounds. She ran as well as she could. We'll 
nominate to the Chula Vista Handicap (Sept. 1) and see what takes shape." 
</P>
<P>
Quiet American, who was making his first start since mid-April, will go next in 
either the Cabrillo (Aug. 25) locally or the Woodward (Sept. 15) at Belmont 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go against Criminal Type and get weight from him and can't beat him, I'd 
be foolish to go back to New York against him in the Breeders' Cup (Classic) 
carrying equal weights," trainer Gary Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye and Laffit Pincay both won twice Sunday. Pat Valenzuela, who won 
the third with Sassy Slew, leads the jockey standings with 16 victories. 
</P>
<P>
A field of nine 2-year-olds was entered for Wednesday's $75,000 De Anza Stakes 
at six furlongs. Topping the field are Iroquois Park, who will be adding 
blinkers for Wayne Lukas, and maiden winners Xray and Southern Justice.

FUNNY, SUNNY BEACH EXHIBIT; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: A LIGHTHEARTED EXHIBIT OF ARTFUL WHIMSY IS OFFERED AT THE GALLERY OF 
FUNCTIONAL ART IN SANTA MONICA. IT'S A WITTY PARODY OF WHAT'S OUT THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles architect and author whose most 
recent book is The Watts Towers of Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
While watching a weenie roast on a fork jutting from the center of his 
dish-shaped solar barbecue, artist David Gale ran through the many uses he 
imagined for his fanciful fryer. 
</P>
<P>
"The barbecue could double as a hot baptismal font," he said. "All I want to do 
is to stimulate ideas for enjoying our plentiful beach sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
Gale's "Dogmaster 2400" solar barbecue, priced at $1,950, is included in "A Day 
at the Beach," an exhibition of beach objects created by artists presented by 
the Gallery of Functional Art in Santa Monica through Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to set up a lighthearted summer show," said gallery owner Lois 
Lambert. Pointing to a pair of scantily clad skateboarders rolling along the 
sidewalk past her Main Street gallery windows, Lois added: "The stuff in here 
relates to what's out there." 
</P>
<P>
A witty parody of "what's out there" is reflected in Phil Garner's made-over 
1973 Toyota Corolla. Stripped of doors and roof, its motor exposed, the Toyota 
is painted sunshine-yellow outside and blood-red in its interior. Renamed 
"Restless Nature," the "beachified" car has a electric horn mounted on its 
windshield and a rear fender stenciled with the gentle message: "Protect the 
Innocent." 
</P>
<P>
At $3,995, Garner's Toyota is a steal compared to Peter Schroff's $18,000 
untitled surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
Described by the artist as "a home entertainment center for the beach," 
Schroff's shocking pink fiberglass surfboard includes: an aquarium with live 
fish, a Sony TV, a bubble-gum vending machine, a radio, a beer keg, an electric 
guitar, a fan, a clock, an ashtray with cigarette lighter, and a live parrot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total beach environment -- the ultimate party board for you and your 
friends," Schroff said. "Everything you need to survive on the sand is here, 
for body and soul." 
</P>
<P>
If 18 grand is a trifle too steep for your body and soul, Schroff offers $2,600 
customized surfboards to suit all tastes. Some are painted with Day-Glo 
sunsets. One, fit for an Indian fakir, is studded with sharp orange spikes. 
</P>
<P>
In a solemn mood, Lambert said that Schroff's surfboards represent "totem-like 
sources of language, music and fashion for an entire subculture" by "turning 
the tables on one of the most potent of all California beach icons." Cracking a 
smile, she added: "They're also terrific fun." 
</P>
<P>
Also great fun are Jim Ganzer's $1,500 "Palm Chairs," cleverly constructed of 
screwed-together, seasoned palm wood, and Philip Miller's "Heal the Babe," a 
welded steel rocking chair that looks as if it could survive both earthquake 
and tidal wave. 
</P>
<P>
And if the present drought lasts long enough to wither palms, you could sit on 
the sand under Ty Bowman's "Utilities," a tree whose trunk and drooping fronds 
are made of recycled black rubber tires. 
</P>
<P>
For beach cyclists, architect Gregg Fleishman has crafted an $11,500 reclining 
bike made of plywood and steel. 
</P>
<P>
Fleishman's low-slung cycle marries the curved, laminated wood of his 
well-known line of furniture with racing bike technology. "The bike has a low 
center of gravity for safety, and the plywood seat flexes with the movements of 
your body," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most bikes look as if they're either impaling their rider or putting him to 
sleep. I wanted to make a bicycle that was both stylish and comfy to ride." 
</P>
<P>
Comfort seems less crucial to artist David Flynn. His $1,800 rocker, "Chevy 
'37," is actually a wooden park bench mounted on the suspension of a 1937 Chevy 
he found lying in the street near his Wilmington studio. Also scavenged from 
his junk-fertile neighborhood are bolted and chained railroad ties that have 
been turned into a giant folding beach chess set. Entitled "Chest" it looks as 
if it were designed for sun-loving giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in the implications of chairs," Flynn said. "Ever since people 
stopped squatting on the ground, they've played a million variations on the 
idea of sitting." 
</P>

An earnest intention to recycle abandoned objects and conserve natural 
resources is a theme that preoccupies many of the designers whose works are on 
display in "A Day at the Beach."

strong ecological statement.

"My fountain incorporates both the need to keep reusing our precious water and 
the warning that the man-made world will rust if we don't take care of it," she 
said. "At the same time it gives pleasure during a hot day at the beach, giving 
out negative ions that recharge the spirit and soft sounds that soothe the 
mind."

THIS SCREENWRITER TRAINED THE 'NAVY SEALS' WAY; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: FOR CHUCK PFARRER, THE SAME RULE APPLIES IN THE MILITARY AND HOLLYWOOD. 
'YOU LEARN TO ADAPT AND SURVIVE. OR ELSE.' 
</P>

<P>
Just what was it about being a Navy SEAL that prepares one for the life of a 
screenwriter? 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Pfarrer, 33, who co-wrote the screenplay for Orion's "Navy SEALS," 
doesn't ponder the question long. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they both require discipline. They are both very humbling. And you're 
fighting an implacable foe. In the case of a writer, the blank sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no rules (in Hollywood). So you bring your own with you. The 
discipline and work ethic that I have lived by have been good for me here. 
</P>
<P>
"And you learn to adapt and survive. Or else. Just like in the (SEAL) teams." 
</P>
<P>
Although he served six years with the SEALS, the Navy's elite anti-terrorist, 
clandestine operation teams, Pfarrer's screenwriting career is hardly a 
one-note thing. He has another film coming out this summer, "Dark Man," a 
science-fiction adventure from Universal that he also co-wrote with "Dark Man" 
director Sam Raimi. Another of his screenplays, "Medal of Valor," is in 
pre-production at Warner Bros. And he still has hopes for the first screenplay 
he wrote on his own, a conceit on a true incident in Ernest Hemingway's life. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this is an idea man. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I enjoy most about writing," Pfarrer says, "is when the 
ideas are really coming to you. Sometimes your brain is like an FM receiver; 
the ideas come thick and fast and all you can do is type as quickly as you 
can." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a naval officer, Pfarrer attended 12 grade schools and four high 
schools as his father's assignments kept the family on the move. After studying 
clinical psychology at Britain's University of Bath, Pfarrer graduated from Cal 
State Northridge with honors. 
</P>
<P>
"I had already begun my graduate studies when I realized that I didn't want to 
spend my 20s in graduate school and as an intern. So I quit. And went looking 
for the biggest challenge I could find," Pfarrer said. 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled at the Officer Candidate School at Newport, R.I., in 1980 after the 
Navy agreed to his request for SEAL training. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew, through being around my father, that the SEALS were the Navy's elite 
fighting unit. I knew they were a special group of people. And they are made up 
of all kinds. There's a United States senator (Bob Kerrey of Nebraska) who is a 
former SEAL, and a professional wrestler (Jesse Ventura). In my group, there 
was a decathlete and a Rhodes scholar. 
</P>
<P>
"And I knew the training would be difficult. I steeled myself for that. But 
nothing, nothing can prepare you for what they put you through. The dropout 
rate for SEAL training is about 80%. And sometimes an entire class will drop 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The first six months of SEAL training is known as BUDS -- basic underwater 
demolition-SEALS. It is especially grueling and includes a "hell week" period 
in which the candidates are denied sleep for six days. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to see what we could do when we were wet, cold, hungry, tired and 
lost, and receiving contradictory orders. 
</P>
<P>
"What they were seeking is something I didn't know I had. None of us did. They 
were looking for a level of resourcefulness, a can-do attitude, that would get 
you through any situation, no matter how dangerous. It's results they're 
interested in. 
</P>
<P>
"And they were looking to bring out leadership in us. They were not trying to 
create robots." 
</P>
<P>
For those who survived, it was on to three weeks of airborne school. (SEALS 
comes from Sea, Air, Land and they have to learn to fight, survive and escape 
in all environments.) And then the successful candidate is assigned to a 12-man 
SEAL team -- for six months of probation. 
</P>
<P>
Having survived all that, Pfarrer got to see a lot of the world -- "everywhere 
they eat rice." He served four years and was in Beirut at the time of the 
barracks bombing. It was during this time that he got a phone call that 
eventually changed the course of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"As sort of a lark, I had written a screenplay with a friend of mine while we 
were in graduate school. It wasn't very good, and I never gave it another 
thought. Then, maybe three years later, he calls and tells me he reworked the 
screenplay, had sold it, and now we both had agents at William Morris." 
</P>
<P>
Pfarrer was about to leap back into civilian life when the Navy made him an 
offer he could not refuse. "I re-upped for two years when they gave me a 
special assignment. But, I can't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The William Morris agent, Brenda Feigen, encouraged Pfarrer to write a 
screenplay about the SEALS. Now an independent producer, Feigen is the producer 
of "Navy SEALS." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a special responsibility, being the first SEAL to a make a SEAL film. I 
wanted to get it right, and I think we did. We had a screening for 300 SEALS in 
Coronado the other night, and I was scared to death. But they all liked it." 
</P>
<P>
If the SEALS enjoyed it, the critics were much less kind. Pfarrer can deal with 
that too. "This isn't 'Othello.' It's an action picture. As Popeye would say, 
it is what it is."

WRITERS GUILD URGES CHANGE IN MPAA RATING SYSTEM 
</P>

<P>
While acknowledging that the current movie ratings system has "served the 
public interest and the (film industry) for years," the Writers Guild of 
America on Friday added its voice to the chorus of critics calling for changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that there is something wrong (with the ratings system)," said 
WGA West President George Kirgo, adding his personal view that the ratings have 
not "kept up with the times." 
</P>
<P>
Kirgo said he is not sure the answer is an A rating, a new category designating 
non-pornographic adults-only films, which has been suggested by some film 
critics, independent distributors and several high-profile directors. But he 
said there are sufficient inequities in the system to warrant "serious 
dialogue" on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, has agreed to 
meet with representatives from both the Directors Guild of America and the 
Writers Guild this week, with the meetings expected to take place Wednesday or 
Thursday in Los Angeles. The discussions may also be attended by several of the 
directors who signed a recent petition requesting a modification of the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The petition was circulated by Silverlight Entertainment, a small New 
York-based independent distributor that is about to release Wayne Wang's "Life 
Is Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper Is Expensive." The film received an X from the 
MPAA's ratings board, and such well-known directors as Francis Coppola, Sydney 
Pollack, Blake Edwards and David Lynch signed the petition asking the MPAA to 
create a category for non-pornographic films intended for adult audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The X rating has become almost exclusively identified with hard-core sex films. 
The result is that makers of legitimate mature-themed movies tagged with the 
rating are unable to book their films with many theater chains or advertise 
them in many media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Silverlight intends to release "Life Is Cheap . . . " with a self-administered 
A rating. In advertising copy that has been submitted to newspapers, a 
disclaimer explains there is no MPAA rating because "many leading filmmakers 
believe the MPAA's current rating system promotes censorship and does not serve 
the best interests of the viewing public."

ENDOWMENT'S UNNOTICED ECLECTICISM: 700 GRANTS

The NEA's advisory National Council on the Arts seemed to navigate piles of 
politically sensitive grants during a tempestuous weekend meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
But virtually without notice it approved 700 grant applications, worth $13 
million, to arts projects that are in the diverse, eclectic tradition that has 
established the NEA as perhaps the most unusual agency of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them seemingly defied the argument that the arts endowment is a godless 
obscenity monger. Others recalled and emphasized a pure artistic tradition in 
which the NEA has in past years awarded grants for, among other things, a 
landscape design project for the Moon. Among the newly approved grants: 
</P>
<P>
* $12,500 to a Stanford, Calif., man who proposes to assemble an exhibit of 
calligraphic art illustrating verses from the Bible by a total of 50 artists 
from 21 different countries. The biblical message, said an NEA grant 
description, will result in "a variety of themes and images accompanied by 
commentary from each artist about experience in interpreting the verses." 
</P>
<P>
* $9,000 to Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), for a project in which 
artist/educator Susan Mogul will prepare an exhibition produced by a mix of 20 
deaf and gifted children from the Multnomah Street Elementary School. The 
children will keep individual journals during a three-month residency by Mogul 
at the school. LACE will exhibit a multimedia mural prepared by Mogul using the 
journals as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
* $10,000 for a project by a Redondo Beach man, Stanley W. Resnicoff, in which 
he will produce a videotape for children that explains how toys are designed. 
An animated character will use computer technology to permit a child to select 
a toy that is then taken apart before his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
* $75,000 for the American Indian Council of Architects and Engineers and 
Native American Housing for architectural design studies to produce prototypes 
for improved housing for American Indians. The goal is to break down the 
monotony and poor quality of much housing on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
* 9,000 to the Alabama State Council on the Arts and a organization called the 
Wiregrass Sacred Harp Singers to fund a series of performance workshops on 
traditional folk singing in the South. 
</P>
<P>
* $9,000 to the Community Music Center to establish programs specializing in 
classical music, spirituals and jazz that will be performed by inner city 
children. The young musicians will participate in an orchestra, chorus, string 
quartet, brass quintet and male quartet. 
</P>
<P>
* $5,000 for the Aleph Movement Theater, of Helena, Mont., to develop audience 
enhancement techniques for use by a touring stage company that travels 
extensively to isolated rural communities throughout Montana. Another $15,000 
will go to the Fairmont Theatre of the Deaf in Cleveland for a series of plays 
throughout the Great Lakes region put on by deaf and blind performers. 
</P>
<P>
* $10,000 to the Sealaska Heritage Foundation in Juneau to underwrite the 
1990-91 season of the Naa Kahidi Theater, which specializes in dramatic 
productions of legends of the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian cultures. The 
theater emphasizes locales that are inaccessible by road.

FROM HEAVEN TO HELL: A HIBAKUSHA'S STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAZ SUYEISHA, AS TOLD TO SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaz Suyeisha, below, was an 18-year-old resident of Hiroshima when the atomic 
bomb was dropped. She is a former president of the Southern California chapter 
of the Committee for Atomic Bomb Survivors, and served as technical consultant 
on the film, "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes," which airs on KNBC Channel 4 
tonight at 9. 
</P>
<P>
I am hibakusha. That means atomic bomb survivor. I am 63 years old. 
</P>
<P>
I used to try to forget about my own experience. Remembering brought too much 
pain, and nightmares, almost a nervous breakdown. But it's most difficult to 
forget. Your inside heart has a deep inside scar. And this scar will never 
disappear until you die. 
</P>
<P>
I will tell you what happened, for a peace education. Because I want no more 
hibakusha. 
</P>
<P>
It was a beautiful blue sky. Just like a long time ago in Los Angeles. A clear 
day. And I did see the B-29, the American airplane. 
</P>
<P>
People used to call the B-29 "B-san" -- it's a nice cute nickname. It was a 
very innocent airplane. We used to call it "the angel." The only difference is 
that 45 years ago today, this angel left a white spot in the beautiful blue 
sky. And you knew it was a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
I was noticing this white spot was coming down and I thought, "Oh my God, it's 
a parachute." I thought an American pilot was coming down all by himself. Then 
all of a sudden there was a powerful flash, like when you shoot a picture, only 
a thousand times more powerful. Then I used both hands and tried to cover the 
eye, tried to cover the ear. After that I don't remember. The house collapsed 
on top of my body -- that's why I wasn't burned. It was right in the city of 
Hiroshima, a mile from Target Radius. 
</P>
<P>
My father was in the middle of the garden, no shade or anything, so he had 
third-degree burns. He suffered until he died. It was so ugly. The whole family 
became radiation sick, but we didn't know what it was. 
</P>
<P>
The same day we had the black rain. Black rain is radiation ashes mixed with 
rain. It was still daytime. 
</P>
<P>
The whole family was heavily injured but we were somehow struggling to survive. 
We had no medical aid. Somehow the people helped each other, healed each other, 
loved each other. Without that, I don't think we would have survived. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the bomb dropped I remembered it was a moment ago a beautiful sky 
and the angel was flying the blue sky, just like heaven at peace. And then it 
changed all of a sudden, heaven to hell. 
</P>
<P>
For a while it was silent. And then I heard, "Help me, help me." That was my 
father. 
</P>
<P>
In the neighborhood, everybody joined in front of our house, and we all looked 
at each other, shocked. Everybody was injured. And nobody knew what happened. 
Everybody thought it was a small bomb dropped right in front of their house, in 
their yard. We didn't know there was just one bomb. We didn't know The Bomb was 
going to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The city was completely destroyed. My father used to have a big property with a 
big yard, and across the street he had income property. The fire stopped just 
at my father's income property. It was damaged, but we had the lumber. So we 
used it to build a temporary home. We had no nails, nothing, no hammer, 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Friends from the countryside started bringing food. Everybody shared. Instead 
of having one piece of food, you could make a stew and you could share with 
many people. 
</P>
<P>
I came back to the U.S. in 1949 to study fashion design. Then I went back to 
Japan and came back again three years later to marry my husband. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people say, "You must be angry at the Americans because they dropped 
the bomb." Why should I? I cannot hate America. This country is my father, 
Japan my mother. I was born in this country, Pasadena. That's why I never 
called the people "enemy." This is my own country. If I hate, I hate war. Not 
the country, not the people. 
</P>
<P>
Hating each other, hating other people, that's how they started the war. And I 
don't want war. No way. 
</P>
<P>
When I got the phone call to help with the movie, at first I didn't say yes. I 
had to find out what kind of movie, find out if it was too political. We don't 
like people calling just to use us. But I met the producers and I agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The memory came back when I was making the movie. The memory came back and I 
would cry every day. I told everybody, please call me mama-san. I was not 
comfortable with my title, consultant. I used to tell Peter-san (director Peter 
Werner), "You sure make a mama-san cry every single day." And believe me, I 
really cried every single day. 
</P>
<P>
But now my tear is happy. This movie is the dream come true. All the children 
with the family sitting down in front of the TV and watching, and you don't 
need any explanation. 
</P>
<P>
So many people asked, "Why do you show horrible things? You shouldn't show 
horrible things." Well, how can you keep this world at peace without any peace 
education? 
</P>
<P>
I am not proud to be hibakusha. No more hibakusha. 
</P>
<P>
Peace.

AMERICAN ALBUM: U.S. LEADERS GET GLOOMY VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

ASPEN, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not easy to be gloomy in this sun-washed resort town, nestled 7,908 feet 
above the cares of the world in the lush stillness of the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But 400 representatives from the peaks of U.S. business, academia and 
government who gathered here last weekend did their best. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a symposium marking the 40th anniversary of the Aspen 
Institute, a combination think tank, retreat and upscale adult education center 
that exposes business and government leaders to the great books of Western 
literature and philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
But the proceedings more resembled a wake for the American Century. 
</P>
<P>
Under crystalline blue skies disturbed only by an occasional passing 
thunderstorm, the panelists surveyed the American social horizon -- and found 
it shrouded with dark clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker after speaker lamented the decline of American education, 
competitiveness and moral fiber, the stagnation in productivity growth and the 
slippage of average real wages. In this enclave of $10 hamburgers, $45 designer 
T-shirts and million-dollar condominiums, they bemoaned the widening gap 
between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
"We are en route to becoming one of the largest Third World nations on the 
globe," said Leonard A. Lauder, president and chief executive officer of Estee 
Lauder Companies. 
</P>
<P>
"With one rationale or another, we seem to be in a position of justifying 
retreat," said former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us feel an . . . uneasiness about the next five to 10 years," said John 
J. Phelan, chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The conference opened Thursday with the presentation of a distinguished 
leadership award to President Bush. But once he retreated to Air Force One and 
the meeting got down to shirt sleeves, Bush took his lumps. 
</P>
<P>
He was never criticized by name, but no one misunderstood who TV commentator 
Bill Moyers had in mind when he chided politicians who confuse leadership with 
"waving flags and refusing to eat their broccoli." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the tone at this summit meeting of the earnest, the wealthy and the 
powerful was as grim as the platform-writing sessions at the 1988 Democratic 
National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Only occasional shafts of optimism peeked through the gray. For all the 
nation's problems, Phelan observed, it remains a magnet for ambitious people 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard international affairs professor Joseph S. Nye Jr. complained that the 
bleak assessments of American competitiveness only presented "one-half of the 
ledger." American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker noted that, 
despite all the holes in the educational system, as a nation we graduate a far 
higher percentage of students from high school than 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As often in these international gatherings, the most encouraging prognosis for 
America came from a gracious Japanese guest. Former Japanese Finance Minister 
Kicchi Miyazawa declared that "eventually the U.S. will be the greatest nation 
in the world" -- although, he allowed, only after an economic restructuring 
that "will not be an easy process." 
</P>
<P>
All this was less striking for its content -- the catechism of American decline 
has been a staple of public policy conferences since the publication of Paul 
Kennedy's "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" -- than its source. 
</P>
<P>
These grave warnings about the erosion of leadership came primarily from people 
who are themselves leaders -- an incongruity that at once underlined the 
pervasive concern about many of the trends in American life and the inability 
of anyone to effectively mobilize that sentiment behind any agenda. Nothing was 
more apparent than the eroding confidence of these opinion leaders that the 
people living in the foothills and lowlands care much about their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, the conferees listened to Moyers and Barbara Walters lead a 
panel that summarized the previous days' indictment of American drift, then the 
dignified notes of the American Brass Quintet, and finally a vigorous call for 
"a new global community" from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Then, 
inspired or discouraged or confused, they filed out toward paneled rooms and 
four days of accumulated messages in Washington, Boston, New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And on the trails beyond the conference center, mountain bikers in neon Gor-tex 
and skintight Lycra chased the cool summer breeze, just as they do every 
August, no matter how the tides of history are running.

CHINA TO JOIN IRAQ ARMS EMBARGO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
China announced Sunday that it will join Western nations in an international 
arms embargo against Iraq in response to that nation's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's action came after two days of talks between Chinese officials and 
visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, who flew here 
Saturday to discuss the Iraqi invasion, Cambodia and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon met with Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Assistant Foreign 
Minister Xu Dunxin before flying on to Tokyo on Sunday, according to a Western 
diplomat who spoke on condition that he not be further identified. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Solomon's departure, the official New China News Agency quoted a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that "since China had voted for the U.N. 
Security Council Resolution 660 against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it will, 
naturally, not sell arms to Iraq under such circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
China was a major supplier of arms to both Iraq and Iran during their long war 
in the 1980s. It has been the third-largest supplier of arms to Iraq after the 
Soviet Union and France. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing has refused, however, to officially acknowledge its sales to Iraq and 
Iran, which were sometimes routed through North Korea. For years, Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesmen routinely denied making sales that Western 
governments said had indisputably taken place. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, China's announcement Sunday apparently is being accepted as 
sincere. The Western diplomat who discussed Solomon's visit described the 
announcement as China's "answer" to the American request. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between Solomon and Chinese officials were "constructive, frank and 
cordial," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
It is "very important," he said, that China and the United States be able to 
"make progress" on issues such as this one, which he described as "a life and 
death" matter. He said the Chinese response Sunday "plays constructively into 
the domestic (American) support for the (U.S.-China) relationship, (or) it 
should." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon and Chinese officials discussed bilateral U.S.-China relations 
primarily in "generalities," the diplomat said. Cambodia was discussed at some 
length, but he did not reveal details of those talks. 
</P>
<P>
No request was made to Beijing to join in economic sanctions against Iraq, he 
said. It is difficult for the United States to press for Chinese economic 
sanctions against a third country when the United States still has economic 
sanctions in place against China, he said. Those sanctions were imposed in 
response to Beijing's violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
During Solomon's visit, the Chinese side again raised a request for U.S. 
sanctions against Beijing to be lifted, the diplomat said.

GEOPOLITICS: BUT WITH THE END OF THE COLD WAR, 3RD WORLD NATIONS NO LONGER CAN 
COUNT ON THE SUPPORT OF ONE OF THE SUPERPOWERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
As far back as Thomas Jefferson, Americans have been quick -- some say too 
quick -- to let loose with economic sanctions in international disputes. 
</P>
<P>
In modern times, these gentler means of persuasion, which Jefferson called 
"peaceful coercion," usually have failed because too many ways around them 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the United States and others imposing sanctions on Iraq in 
retaliation for its invasion of Kuwait, the debate over economic sanctions is 
about to resume in a new context: Without the Cold War, a smaller country no 
longer has one superpower to play against another, and -- in this unique case 
-- both superpowers are in alignment. 
</P>
<P>
How well will sanctions work this time? 
</P>
<P>
Historically, analysts generally agree, economic sanctions were totally 
effective only when overwhelming pressure could be brought against a weak 
target with nobody to turn to. This was the case, for example, when President 
Jimmy Carter withheld aid from Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza in 1978. In the 
absence of somebody to rescue him, the sanction precipitated the dictator's 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions also can be counterproductive, hurting the United States 
more than the target. Companies such as General Electric and Caterpillar have 
lost major contracts with the Soviet Union because of U.S. economic sanctions, 
and American wheat farmers still harbor resentment over the Carter 
Administration's grain embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, economic sanctions have been popular in the United States because 
they tend to meet a deep psychological need among many Americans to make a 
statement stronger than words but less drastic than war. And in the present 
case, the United States appears to be ill-positioned to engage a potent Middle 
East force militarily. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, sanctions against Iraq face obstacles, and the chief one is the 
difficulty of transforming the U.S. embargo into a world embargo. While 
European nations have imposed sanctions, and Japan has joined in, there remain 
a number of other markets for Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Washington fails to enlist the cooperation of everyone -- Western 
Europe and Japan buy more oil from both Iraq and Kuwait than the United States 
buys -- American support for sanctions probably will remain high. 
</P>
<P>
"We have entered a period of domestic life where sanctions are applauded by 
domestic legislators even though they know they won't have any effect," says 
Gary Hufbauer, a Georgetown University professor who co-authored the 1985 
landmark study, "Economic Sanctions Reconsidered," for the Institute of 
International Economics. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attitude is that we would like sanctions to work, but if they don't work 
that is OK too, because it is the right thing to do and we are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
However, the more the Cold War has ground down, the more the turning of the 
economic screw on foreign countries has seemed to obtain at least some of the 
desired results. 
</P>
<P>
With a rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union, targets no 
longer can rely upon what students of economic sanctions call the "black 
knight." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a black knight -- the other superpower -- coming to the aid of a 
target country is history," says a leading economic sanctions expert, Jeffrey 
J. Schott of the Institute of International Economics in Washington. "At least, 
it won't happen to the extent that it did. Attitudes have changed, and the 
black knight is vanishing along with the East-West confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
For Third World leaders who like to tweak giants' noses, this is bleak news. 
</P>
<P>
From the end of World War II until recently, whenever a superpower wanted to 
lean on an upstart smaller country and stop trade, cut aid, freeze assets or 
inflict another form of economic pressure, the nation to be punished could 
appeal to, and often count on, the other superpower for help. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, a good many countries -- among them India, Egypt, Afghanistan, 
Ghana, Ethiopia, Brazil -- played to both camps through the black-knight 
option. 
</P>
<P>
It became a kind of international joke -- except to the superpowers -- as 
Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries used the ploy and 
blunted the economic sanctions weapon. 
</P>
<P>
But as Moscow and Washington have moved closer to each other, economic 
sanctions against third parties may have become more effective. 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua, Moscow ultimately declined to play the black knight and thus let 
U.S. sanctions against the Marxist Central American government take almost full 
effect. At least marginally, analysts believe, this induced the Daniel Ortega 
regime to agree to free elections. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama, Moscow did not come to the economic relief of strongman Manuel A. 
Noriega. Although U.S. military force eventually was brought to bear, economic 
sanctions are believed to have contributed to the readiness of Panamanians -- 
who had nowhere else to turn -- to welcome American troops. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, as Washington sees it, the white knight won in the black 
knight's absence. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania, on the other hand, the Bush Administration refused a black-knight 
role by declining to send economic aid to the Baltic republic after Moscow 
imposed sanctions and forced the Vilnius government to suspend its declaration 
of independence from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
As Moscow views it, the white knight -- Moscow, naturally -- took the day. 
</P>
<P>
In all three cases, it can be argued that economic sanctions had sufficient 
bite to affect the outcome. But not everyone fully supports such an idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite public perceptions that sanctions in South Africa, Panama and 
Nicaragua had an impact, only in one case would we agree -- in the case of 
Nicaragua, and even there we feel the effect was marginal," said Hufbauer of 
Georgetown University, who with Schott, the International Institute of 
Economics scholar, wrote the 1985 landmark study "Economic Sanctions 
Reconsidered." 
</P>
<P>
"In Panama and South Africa, economic sanctions have not achieved their stated 
goals," Hufbauer said. "In Panama we had to invade, and in South Africa even 
Nelson Mandela concedes they have not worked, although he wants them 
maintained." 
</P>
<P>
In those cases, the target country's economic resources -- mainly canal fees in 
the case of Panama and raw material exports in the case of South Africa -- were 
sufficient to withstand U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, though," Hufbauer says, "economic sanctions can be seen as getting a 
new vitality, now that smaller countries can no longer rush to the other 
superpower for help. In this sense, target countries are more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
At present, Hufbauer and Schott are tabulating statistics for an updating of 
their original study that will take into account the subsiding of Cold War 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Both agree that Bush is more restrained in his application of economic 
sanctions than his immediate predecessor, Ronald Reagan. "Bush is more in tune 
with our allies than Reagan ever was," Hufbauer said, citing Bush's restraint 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the United States has more sanctions in place against more countries 
-- 15 at present count -- than any other nation. Altogether since the 1956 Suez 
crisis, Washington has enacted economic sanctions against 57 nations, including 
allies Britain and France (over their invasion of Suez) and friendly nations 
Israel, Taiwan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have ranged from comprehensive trade and investment embargoes to 
bans on air landing rights. 
</P>
<P>
Some sanctions -- such as those against North Korea -- have been in place as 
long as 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
In their joint study, an examination of 103 cases of economic sanctions imposed 
by the United States and other countries since 1914, Schott and Hufbauer found 
that sanctions had failed to achieve their goals in an overwhelming number of 
cases and often were counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Where they found cases of effective sanctions, the instances involved measures 
to attain specific objectives against smaller countries such as South Korea and 
Taiwan which agreed under American pressure to relinquish nuclear reprocessing 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Currently on the U.S. economic sanctions list, in addition to Iraq and North 
Korea, are Cuba, Libya, Iran and Syria (on grounds that they sponsor 
terrorism); Vietnam and Cambodia (as a consequence of Vietnam's 1978 invasion 
of Cambodia), and South Africa as a result of its apartheid policies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Washington withholds most-favored-nation trading status from the 
Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Albania and Mongolia on 
grounds that they violate human rights. (Hungary and Poland have been removed 
from this list, and waivers are expected for others.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRAQ'S OIL CUSTOMERS 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Iraq supplied the West with an average of 1.58 million barrels of oil 
each day. Below is a breakdown of who purchased those exports. Although the 
United States buys more than 28% of Iraq's exports to the West, it represents 
only 3% of total U.S. consumption.

LA LIMA, Honduras 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reeling from Honduras' costliest labor feud in 36 years, the civilian 
government sent army troops onto banana plantations and censored radio 
broadcasts Sunday to help an American multinational fruit company end a 
seven-week-old strike by 10,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Two workers and an undercover police officer were wounded outside the Chiquita 
Brands headquarters here when a soldier fired his machine gun into an angry 
crowd Saturday night. Tension prevailed Sunday as 30 truckloads of 
strikebreakers moved out from the headquarters to banana fields on Honduras' 
tropical north coast. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort was only partly successful, and the government summoned both 
sides to resume wage talks. A company field organizer said some of the 2,800 
workers on the trucks had entered five of the 24 idled plantations to harvest 
bananas. At other plantations, reporters saw the trucks turned away by pickets, 
despite army escorts. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter dispute involves the world's largest banana company, formerly United 
Fruit, whose clout in Honduras gave this country, the poorest in Central 
America, its infamous "banana republic" label. The strike has provoked 
President Rafael L. Callejas' first crisis by threatening a carefully managed 
program of national economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Bananas earn more than a third of Honduras' export dollars, and Chiquita's 
subsidiary here, the Tela Railroad Co., produces the lion's share. In an 
interview last week, Callejas said the strike against the country's largest 
private employer was having "a terrible impact" -- $18.5 million in lost 
exports and uncollected taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a banana republic, but not in the pejorative term of the past," 
Callejas said. "We want to produce more bananas. We should become the largest 
producer of bananas in the world." 
</P>
<P>
After taking office Jan. 27, Callejas helped broker a Nicaraguan peace accord 
that rid Honduras of 14,000 unwanted Nicaraguan rebels. By moving boldly 
against the overvalued lempira, which had traded at 50 U.S. cents since 1918, 
and by raising taxes, he restored Honduras' credit with foreign lenders. 
</P>
<P>
But the cost of the 50% devaluation was a corresponding burst of inflation that 
riled Honduras' well-organized unions. Callejas has moved cautiously, canceling 
a milk price increase in the face of popular outcry and trying to mediate the 
dispute over banana wages, which have not risen in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The banana union, born in a 69-day strike in 1954 that crippled the country and 
won workers the right to organize, is one of Honduras' most privileged and most 
militant. It faces a company that has been trying for decades to destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming the devaluation halved Chiquita's labor costs, the union on Friday 
rejected a government-proposed 25% boost in the $3.81 daily wage that Chiquita 
had accepted. The union is demanding 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"We work for a foreign company making millions of dollars, and all we're asking 
for is small change," said Horacio Cruz, 61, a 1954 strike veteran. "The 
government is still on the side of the rich." 
</P>
<P>
The government backed the company after banana union leaders asked other 
workers to support them with a nationwide strike this week. To muffle that 
appeal, Callejas ordered radio stations to limit news to official communiques.

The Japanese people -- already the longest living in the world -- broke their 
own records for life expectancy in 1989 with women living to an average of 
81.77 years and men 75.91 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, Japan had previously topped the world in life 
expectancy with an average life span for both men and women of 78. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Welfare, announcing the figures Saturday, said a 
decrease in deaths among infants and middle-aged people was largely responsible 
for the latest figures in longevity.

</P>
<P>
INDIANS: CONFUSION AND DOUBTS ABOUT THE 15 CANDIDATES HAVE PRODUCED A QUIET 
CAMPAIGN. TRIBAL GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION COULD BE THE DECIDING ISSUE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Like many Navajos, 68-year-old Eva Haswood is confused by the choices she faces 
in Tuesday's Navajo Nation primary election -- and she is not getting much help 
from those running for office. 
</P>
<P>
With 15 faces in this year's race for leader of the country's largest Indian 
tribe, Haswood says that she has no idea who all the candidates are, much less 
what they'll do for her. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are the familiar front-runners, known as The Big 3: interim 
Navajo President Leonard Haskie, 44; suspended chairman Peter MacDonald, 62, 
and former chairman Peterson Zah, 53. 
</P>
<P>
Haswood says that Navajo politics were different in the old days before Haskie, 
MacDonald and Zah were on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"We would happily vote because there were no bitter feelings," she said through 
a Navajo interpreter. "Now there's so much uncertainty. We wonder if we vote 
for a candidate, if it will be a good vote." 
</P>
<P>
Haswood and her husband, Howard, 78, are similar to other elderly Navajos. From 
the back of their pickup truck at this reservation town's flea market, they can 
still bring in a little extra money by selling healing herbs, a buckskin that 
would make a fine pair of moccasins or an old bow and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
With a couple of hundred buyers and sellers milling around on a Friday 
afternoon, it's a place that should now be ripe with political gossip and 
chitchat, especially with the first of two elections fast approaching. But that 
sort of activity is not taking place, either here or elsewhere on this 
25,000-square-mile reservation. 
</P>
<P>
This election is considered by many to be the most important in Navajo history. 
The two top vote-getters will square off in the Nov. 6 general election for 
president of the Navajo tribe. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, it is the quietest Navajo election season in recent memory. 
The record of MacDonald -- who faces three tribal trials, a federal grand jury 
investigation and other legal problems -- has not been the subject of wide 
criticism by other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been as much politicking," said Bill Donovan, a 20-year observer 
of Navajo politics and acerbic columnist for the tribally owned Navajo Times. 
Earlier campaigns saw the slapped-together headquarters of the candidates 
constantly bustling with people, serving up the Navajo favorite of mutton stew 
and fry bread to the curious and the faithful, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"You would have loudspeakers blasting out their positions on everything all 
during the day and all during the night," Donovan said. "You don't have that 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the half a dozen "headquarters" clustered around the main intersection 
at the tribal capital of Window Rock, Ariz., have the appearance of so many 
abandoned fireworks stands on July 5. The best explanation for the calm, 
Navajos say, is either voter apathy or simply being fed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out here in 1951 and to me this is the most important election since 
that time," said Dr. Robert Roessel, 63, a teacher, school principal and author 
of Navajo books. "It's got to translate into whether or not the Navajos will 
demand honesty and, if they don't, then I think they're in for a very difficult 
time." 
</P>
<P>
When questions of Navajo political scruples arise, not far behind are the names 
of MacDonald, whose image has been marred by scandal, and Zah, whose image is 
unsullied. 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks ago, MacDonald's trial on 247 counts of violating tribal 
election laws stemming from his 1986 campaign, was delayed for a fifth time, 
leaving him free to campaign for a fifth term without the echo of negative 
testimony playing on the front page. He faces two other corruption trials in 
tribal court later this year. 
</P>
<P>
A primary victory appears to be within his grasp, and some observers say that 
the odds favor him because his name is well known to Navajos. Throughout his 
troubles, beginning 17 months ago, MacDonald has retained a solid core of 
staunch supporters, including many loyal tribal council members. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this MacDonald thing is far from over," said Tom Chabin, a non-Indian 
businessman on the reservation. To non-Indians looking in, he says, the 
reelection of MacDonald "would indicate that people here accept corruption as a 
way of doing business on the reservation." 
</P>
<P>
A Zah win, he adds, could mean the return of Navajo preference in tribal hiring 
and contracting and an honest direction in tribal government. 
</P>
<P>
However, Daniel Peaches, a tribal legislative aide and a former associate of 
the ousted chairman, says that Zah must show that he could unify the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Like MacDonald, Zah's supporters are fiercely loyal. That leaves interim 
president Haskie appearing to be in the weakest position of the top three and 
scrambling for votes.

KARL WEBER; LONGTIME RADIO ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karl Weber, a mainstay on many of the most popular radio shows of the wartime 
and postwar years, whose resonant voice later was heard in commercials for the 
presidential campaigns of Lyndon B. Johnson and Nelson A. Rockefeller, has died 
in a Boston hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Weber was 74 when he died July 30 of congestive heart failure near his home in 
Edgartown, Mass., where he had continued to record commercials until his death. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the University of Iowa, Weber -- possibly best-known as the 
husband of "The Woman in White," a medical melodrama of the mid-1940s heard 
over NBC -- began as an actor with Midwestern Shakespearean troupes before 
settling in Chicago where many of the nation's top radio shows then originated. 
</P>
<P>
He went to New York in the late 1940s to help found New Stages, an off-Broadway 
group that helped popularize Jean Paul Sartre's "The Respectful Prostitute" 
before it moved to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
His radio credits over the years included featured roles in "The Strange 
Romance of Evelyn Winters" and "Dr. Sixgun" and ongoing performances in "The 
Barton Family," "Lone Journey," "The Romance of Helen Trent," "Stepmother" and 
"When a Girl Marries." 
</P>
<P>
He also recorded more than 200 books in the Talking Book program of the 
American Foundation for the Blind and served as president of the New York 
chapter of the Screen Actors Guild from 1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by a daughter, two sons, four grandchildren, two 
great-grandchildren, two brothers and a sister.

U.S. and Soviet navies continued their investigations into allegations that a 
U.S. Navy enlisted woman was sexually assaulted aboard one of three Soviet 
naval vessels docked in San Diego last week during a goodwill visit. No new 
information was available and no deadline has been set for concluding the joint 
review of the alleged assault. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is ongoing, but we don't anticipate having anything until 
Monday at the earliest," Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard said. "We hope to conclude 
this as soon as possible, to gather the necessary information as fast as we 
can." The Naval Investigative Service's report will be forwarded to the Soviets 
for handling under their military legal system, Pritchard said. The Soviet 
squadron departed Saturday after a five-day visit.

WILBUR (WILLIE) SCHWARTZ; PLAYED CLARINET WITH GLENN MILLER BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilbur (Willie) Schwartz, whose clarinet Glenn Miller pitched above his 
saxophone section to give that legendary band its distinctive sound, has died 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran reed player, who continued in demand at recording sessions and on 
television until recently, was 72 when he died Friday at Valley Presbyterian 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz came to Miller's band in March, 1938, about the time Miller had 
reformed the group after the departure of several of his original musicians. 
With the addition of new faces, Miller decided to add a new sound and used 
Schwartz's clarinet as a showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz had been playing with the Julie Wintz band in his home state of New 
Jersey when he joined Miller. With Wintz he found himself backing up a young 
comic and master of ceremonies named Jackie Gleason in clubs throughout New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz and Gleason were reunited several years later when both men came to 
Hollywood to make "Orchestra Wives," a widely praised musical film featuring 
the Miller band. 
</P>
<P>
Billy May, the veteran arranger and band leader who joined Miller in 1940, 
remembered Schwartz for his versatility. 
</P>
<P>
"He was constantly in demand for records and studio work because of his ability 
on clarinet, saxophone and flute," May said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz served in the Merchant Marine during World War II and later joined 
Jerry Gray's new band, formed of many Miller alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Schwartz recorded with the Nelson Riddle orchestras that backed 
up Frank Sinatra's Capitol recordings and worked with May and other band 
leaders on various TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he, May and the few other survivors of the Miller band toured as 
a Glenn Miller Reunion Band, playing in Australia and England. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include Schwartz's wife, Peggy, two daughters and a son, a brother, 
sister and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Church of the Hills, 
Forest Lawn Mortuary, Hollywood Hills.

ETERNAL FLAME FOR PEACE STILL WAITING FOR A HOME; 
</P>
<P>
ATOMIC BOMB: ORGANIZERS OF EVENT HONORING JAPANESE VICTIMS OF HIROSHIMA, 
NAGASAKI EXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT OF PERMANENT SITE. GIFT WAS GIVEN TO CITY SIX 
YEARS AGO. 
</P>

<P>
An "eternal flame for peace" that was to have been the center of a ceremony on 
Sunday honoring the Japanese killed by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki 45 years ago remains homeless six years after it was donated to 
the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the 1990 Hiroshima/Nagasaki Commemorative Peace Program had 
expected Mayor Tom Bradley on Sunday to announce a permanent site for the 
flame, which was donated to Los Angeles by the mayor of Hiroshima during the 
1984 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley said there had been a misunderstanding and negotiations were still 
under way to find a home for the tiny Hiroshima Eternal Flame for Peace that 
has been kept alive in a brass lantern at the Koyasan Buddhist Temple in Little 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Cultural Affairs has approved it (the plan for a site)," Bradley 
said at a news conference during the program at the Los Angeles Baha'i Center 
auditorium. "We're well on our way toward establishing a site . . . it's now a 
matter of locating and placing it." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event, however, insisted that they were told by a spokesman 
for Bradley to expect an announcement of a permanent home for the flame on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"On Friday, the mayor's office called us with a statement we could expect to 
hear. What Bradley said today was not that statement," according to an 
organizer who asked that her name not be used. "We aren't sure what happened." 
</P>
<P>
"It is sad," added Kent Wong of Asian Pacific Americans for Nuclear Awareness, 
which made arrangements for the flame to be hand-carried to Los Angeles by a 
Japanese emissary with a pledge that it be kept burning at a permanent site. 
"We really want a home for this flame." 
</P>
<P>
The flame was only formally accepted by Bradley at last year's 44th 
commemorative ceremony of the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the disappointed was Kaz Suyeishi, who was a teen-ager when she was 
knocked unconscious by the atomic blast in Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
"Push him (Bradley) about this, please push him," said Suyeishi, of Pasadena, 
who has devoted her life to the cause of fighting for peace. "This is not our 
responsibility, it is the city's responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Suyeishi, who is a hibakusha (atomic bomb survivor), broke down in 
tears when she recalled the events of Aug. 6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"Against a beautiful blue sky, I saw a B-29 that to me looked like an angel, 
and a tiny white spot falling slowly beneath it," said Suyeishi, who wore a 
black dress for the Sunday ceremony, part of which was broadcast live to Japan 
by satellite. "Then there was a powerful flash of light. 
</P>
<P>
"A moment later, heaven turned to hell and the blue sky turned gray. I heard, 
'Help me, help me.' I saw the city in flames and people everywhere covered with 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not make the same mistake again," added Suyeishi.

REQUESTS CLIMB FOR FREE RIDE ON PARKING TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two things are certain in life, Benjamin Franklin once said, death and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, old Ben never paid a visit to Los Angeles, where a new city parking 
tax is mired in a confusing assortment of regulations and exemptions that city 
officials still haven't sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the tax looks simple enough. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last Wednesday, fees charged on all privately owned parking spaces in 
the city were subject to the 10% tax. Apartment dwellers, commuters, baseball 
fans, shoppers and others will pay the surcharge each time they pull their 
automobiles in a pay-for-park space. City officials project that the tax will 
bring $22.5 million into city coffers each year. 
</P>
<P>
But there is the tricky matter of exemptions. City officials say the Mosquito 
Abatement District, the Wilmington Cemetery District and dozens of other 
government agencies don't have to pay the tax. Banks don't have to pay either, 
although savings and loans do. Insurance brokers will pay, but insurance agents 
won't. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County agencies need not pay the municipal tax, either. County 
employees, however, will be taxed if the Board of Supervisors and the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District agree on a plan to require county 
employees to pay for the parking spaces they currently get free, city officials 
said. That proposal has been hotly opposed by county employees. 
</P>
<P>
Donald De Bord, chief of the tax and permit division of the city clerk's 
office, is in charge of sifting through the confusion. Businessmen and 
bureaucrats have been phoning his office since the tax went into effect, all 
pleading convincing cases as to why they should not be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being advised by people, 'This is what I am and I should have an 
exemption because of what I am,' " De Bord said, adding that he expects the 
bureaucratic dust to settle soon. "We're in a learning process mode." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council and Mayor Tom Bradley approved the tax as part of a revenue 
package to finance the city's record $3.68-billion budget, but several council 
members also hoped it would drive some commuters from their cars and into buses 
and car pools. 
</P>
<P>
De Bord said it was still too early to tell if the tax will bring in less 
revenue than expected because of the growing list of exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal taxes, such as business and utility taxes, often carry exemptions, De 
Bord explained. Banks and insurance companies, for example, pay higher tax 
rates to the state Franchise Tax Board and are thus exempt from most municipal 
taxes by state law. Those rules are being applied to decide who is exempt from 
the city's parking tax. 
</P>
<P>
The motorists who did pay the tax in its first week weren't too happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of public complaints," said Tom Phillips, president of System 
Parking, which operates 30 lots in the downtown area and also the lot at Dodger 
Stadium. "The main complaint is that it seems to have taken a lot of people by 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest tax chunk was paid by monthly customers, who found their paid bills 
for the month of August typically had $15 in taxes tacked on to a monthly 
charge of about $150, Phillips said.

COURTROOM BATTLE SET IN HISTORIC WATER FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ECOLOGY: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY OFFICIALS WANT INCREASED POWER TO OVERSEE THE 
CLEANUP OF SERIOUS UNDERGROUND POLLUTION. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEE A CONFLICT OF 
INTEREST IN THE ATTEMPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Environmentalists in the San Gabriel Valley call their fight against local 
water officials a historic battle over "hearts, minds and faucets." For their 
part, the water officials say they simply want the power to do a job that has 
taken far too long: the complicated and expensive cleanup of one of the West's 
worst water pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
The battle between these two forces goes to court Tuesday, when a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge hears arguments on the Main San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster's request to oversee cleanup of underground pollution in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It is a struggle, however, that extends beyond eastern Los Angeles County. 
Powerful players such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California 
and the Sierra Club have lined up on opposite sides. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge grants the watermaster's request, the nine-member board would get 
increased authority to control how and where water is pumped in the San Gabriel 
Basin -- a crucial step in remedying the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, no one governmental agency has the overall authority to finance and 
supervise the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The watermaster wants to fill this void and work as a cleanup team with three 
key municipal water districts: the Upper San Gabriel, Three Valleys and San 
Gabriel. These districts formally linked forces last week to form the Main San 
Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority, a public agency with the ability to seek 
financing for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
All this troubles environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, which wants the 
state Legislature to create a new, regional super-agency to oversee the 
cleanup. They fear that if local water officials assume the lead role, it would 
represent a conflict of interest and could shut out public participation. The 
watermaster and water boards are partly made up by people whose business is 
making money selling water or those who are closely associated with those who 
do.

"The watermaster cannot protect both the private interests of water companies 
and the public's interests," said Maxine Leichter of the Sierra Club's Angeles 
Chapter, a 58,000-member group. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, environmentalists don't consider the watermaster a public agency. 
Giving more power to it, environmentalists say, would not best serve the 
interests of 1 million water consumers from Alhambra to La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
But local water officials who dismiss the conflict-of-interest charge say that 
creating a new public agency could take years. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, nothing gets accomplished," said Robert G. Berlien, an 
official with the watermaster. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the watermaster has limited control over pumping rights. Pumping affects 
the movement of large underground clusters, or plumes, of pollution. Pulling 
water up in one spot, for example, could draw pollution into a new area, 
tainting a once-clean well. 
</P>
<P>
One in every four wells in the basin has been closed due to contamination 
spread through 200 square miles. The pollution, believed to come from 
degreasing agents and solvents used for decades by aerospace industry 
factories, machine shops and dry cleaners, was discovered in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, federal officials placed the entire San Gabriel Basin on the Superfund 
priority list. Remedying the problem is estimated to take decades and cost $850 
million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an oil spill or smoggy skies, this disaster is hidden from view. 
Observers agree this is why the problem has been so easy to ignore. 
Nonetheless, chemicals each day slowly make their way through the vast but 
fragile underground aquifer system that underlies nearly two dozen cities. 
</P>
<P>
To environmentalists, the fight over the lead agency is historic in the arid 
semi-desert of the San Gabriel Valley. "Water is power in California," Leichter 
said. "This . . . represents the first time there's been a challenge to the 
water establishment in the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has filed a brief supporting 
the environmentalists, arguing that the watermaster is not accountable to the 
public and should not be given the authority it seeks. Besides the Sierra Club 
and the grass-roots activist East Valleys Organization, several other San 
Gabriel Valley groups have come out against the watermaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The waters would be very much muddied if the watermaster were granted 
additional powers," said Jan Chatten-Brown, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's special 
assistant on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Although more guarded in their reaction, regional U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency officials have voiced concerns about cleanup plans proposed by the local 
water agencies, whose approach runs counter to a $106-million, five-year plan 
announced by EPA and state officials in April. 
</P>
<P>
The federal and state water officials favor construction of large-scale 
treatment plants that focus broadly on the dirtiest pockets of pollution. The 
local agencies want to emphasize a more individualized approach, utilizing the 
small-scale cleanup of certain polluted wells. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the EPA concerns, the granddaddy of regional water agencies, the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, supports the watermaster. 
So does the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The State Water Resources Control Board, which is assisting in the cleanup and 
on Thursday reviewed the issue at a Sacramento meeting, has remained neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say they don't trust leaving the cleanup solely to local 
water officials, many of whom also head private water companies or are closely 
connected to those who do. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the watermaster is a dinosaur, a relic," said Carol Montano of the 
East Valleys Organization. "The watermaster runs from accountability." 
</P>
<P>
But watermaster board member Burton E. Jones discounted the notion of a 
conflict of interest, and that the watermaster, along with the new 
water-quality authority, is best suited to handle the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who heads the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District board 
and will serve on the new water quality commission, said: "We will be asking 
for public input and I'm sure we'll get it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150 public and private water companies, water districts and water rights 
holders provide water to consumers in the San Gabriel Basin, which encompasses 
most of the San Gabriel Valley except the Pasadena and Pomona areas. The Main 
San Gabriel Basin Watermaster is a nine-member board overseeing the rights to 
pump water from the vast but polluted basin. Members come from the publicly 
elected boards of the Upper San Gabriel Valley and the San Gabriel Valley 
municipal water districts and from water companies. The watermaster was created 
by a 1973 Los Angeles Superior Court decision that sought to clarify water 
rights in the San Gabriel Valley. Any changes in the watermaster's authority 
must be approved by the court.

Scientists have found fossil remains of a previously unknown eight-foot lizard 
that may have attacked baby dinosaurs, a researcher reported last week. A 
well-preserved skull and a forelimb of the beast, about 80 million years old, 
were unearthed in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, said Michael Novacek, vice president 
and dean of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The creature apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon -- the largest living 
lizard, reaching lengths of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles, 
Novacek said. The present-day animal has been known to attack and consume human 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient lizard, perhaps a juvenile, may have eaten young dinosaurs or 
dinosaur eggs. Its bones were found near a dinosaur nesting site that contained 
eight eggs, Novacek said. The find occurred during an expedition Novacek called 
the first to Mongolia by Western paleontologists in 65 years.

REGULAR PAP SMEARS ARE EFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women who are screened at least once every three years for cervical cancer 
reduce their risk of developing an invasive form of the disease or dying from 
it by about 90%, researchers reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of research conducted in the United States and elsewhere indicates 
that women between the ages of 20 and 65 who have regular Pap smears have only 
an 11-in-10,000 chance of dying from cervical cancer, versus a 118-in-10,000 
risk for women who are never screened. 
</P>
<P>
Regular Pap smears also reduce the chances a woman will develop invasive 
cervical cancer, in which cancer penetrates beyond the top layer of cervical 
cells. Among women regularly screened, the risk for invasive cancer is 35 in 
10,000, versus 250 in 10,000 for unscreened women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many doctors recommend women have a Pap smear every year, the new data 
indicates that Pap tests every two or three years are about as effective as 
annual tests, said Dr. David Eddy, who headed the study for Duke University's 
Center for Health Policy Research and Education and reported the results in the 
Annals of Internal Medicine.

FREE BABY FORMULA DENOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A United Nations conference to promote breast-feeding denounced last week the 
practice of distributing baby formula free to new mothers, particularly those 
in developing nations. The conference urged closer regulation of the marketing 
of baby formula to encourage breast-feeding, which is considered a key to 
lowering infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said even mothers who have tested positive for the AIDS virus should 
breast-feed. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's milk helps boost a baby's immunity and eliminates the need to use 
possibly contaminated water to prepare formula or other food. U.N. officials 
estimate that four million to five million children worldwide could be saved 
each year if they had been breast-fed. 
</P>
<P>
Formula-manufacturing companies often provide baby formula free to new mothers 
in poor countries who are capable of breast-feeding. After beginning to 
bottle-feed her child in the hospital or clinic, the mother continues to do so 
after going home but often does not have the money to buy the proper formula. 
</P>
<P>
Such marketing violates a code adopted by the World Health Organization in 
1979. U.N. officials say only a few countries adhere to the code. The Nestle 
Co., which owns the formula-manufacturing Carnation Co., has been the target of 
a U.S. consumer boycott for a decade because of its marketing of infant 
formulas in developing nations.

MAN WALKING ON VENICE BEACHFRONT SHOT DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Wilmington man was shot and killed Sunday night while walking 
with a group of friends along a beachfront walkway in Venice, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two "possible suspects" were taken into custody and officers recovered a gun, 
believed to be the murder weapon, said Lt. Ross Moen, commander of the 
detective bureau at the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Moen said Timothy Sanchez and his friends were accosted by another group of men 
in the 1009 block of Ocean Front Walk about 6:15 p.m. Sanchez was shot and 
pronounced dead at Santa Monica Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a weapon which we believe was the murder weapon," said Moen, but said 
police did not know what triggered the attack. "At this time we don't know why 
they did it."

Supermarket at Your Door 
</P>
<P>
Safeway Stores, the giant Northern California food retailer that owns 35% of 
Vons Cos., today begins offering a service that is available at only a handful 
of groceries in the Southland: home delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Called Safeway Express, the new service allows customers to phone or fax orders 
to a toll-free number for same-day ($12.50) or next-day ($11.95) delivery. 
Senior citizens can get next-day service for $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
The service could prove challenging to the clerks charged with filling the 
orders. The director of marketing for Shopper's Express in Bethesda, Md., which 
Safeway has hired to provide the service, told the San Francisco Chronicle that 
orders can be quite specific. "Customers can actually say they want six bananas 
-- two ripe, two medium, two green," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boy, I Sure Could Use a Soda 
</P>
<P>
In a move that could inadvertently drive up sales of soft drinks, area motion 
picture theaters will carry a public service announcement on the consequences 
of a severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-second spot, created for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
depicts a "nightmare" situation in which a thirsty man cannot get water to flow 
from his faucet, shower and hose. 
</P>
<P>
The spot will play on more than 150 screens and will be seen by more than 2 
million theatergoers during the months of August and September. Participating 
theater chains include Pacific Theatres, Laemmle Theatres, Metropolitan 
Theatres, AMC Entertainment and United Artists Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
The creators of the spot, which is titled "Imagine," said they hope it will 
remind moviegoers of the need to conserve water as California suffers through 
its fourth year of drought conditions. Soft drink sales are not listed among 
their motives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Let's Meet After Our Meeting 
</P>
<P>
California companies' penchant for meetings has long been parodied with the 
phrase "let's take a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
But now there's proof that among personnel directors, at least, there are few 
places across the country where work weeks are more filled with meetings than 
on the West Coast. A recent survey by Heidrick and Struggles shows that "human 
resources executives," as they're now called, in the West spend an average of 
18.4 hours per week in meetings, and another three hours getting ready for 
them. Only their counterparts in the South topped them; they reported spending 
18.9 hours a week in meetings. And how do they feel about it? Well, 81% rated 
the time spent in meetings as "productive."

CARTER HAWLEY STILL STRUGGLES; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: A LOSS IS LIKELY THIS YEAR FOR THE DEBT-STRAPPED OWNER OF THE 
BROADWAY-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STORES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPRESS OPTIMISM 
ABOUT A TURNAROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Carter Hawley Hale Stores, these were supposed to be good times. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, in spurning a hostile takeover, the Los Angeles retailer spoke 
of a coming turnaround in the department store business, including its own 
Broadway-Southern California stores and four other chains. 
</P>
<P>
Profit, it said, would climb steadily. In a 566-page document prepared as part 
of a reorganization plan, Carter Hawley told shareholders that profit would 
reach $85 million in fiscal 1990, which ended Saturday. Instead, there's likely 
to be a loss of at least $2 million. Saddled with debt, the company made only 
$17.7 million in 1988 and $13.5 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a bad joke," said Edward A. Weller, a highly regarded analyst 
with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley's many critics say the company, after years of comforting itself 
with an upbeat assessment of its own prospects, now faces serious problems. 
They contend that the company -- one of the nation's biggest department store 
empires with 114 outlets -- continues to suffer from aging stores that are 
badly run down and merchandising programs that fall flat. In contrast to 
prosperous, trend-setting retailers such as customer service-minded Nordstrom 
and discount-minded Wal-Mart Stores, Carter Hawley offers "nothing that really 
distinguishes it from the crowd," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for the 
retail consulting firm Management Horizons in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts maintain that Carter Hawley is so weighed down by debt that it 
eventually will be forced to sell out to another firm or, at the very least, 
divest one or more of its divisions. 
</P>
<P>
But the company remains optimistic. "We have been successful in setting the 
right direction," said Philip M. Hawley, the company's chief executive since 
1977 and its chairman since 1983. "I think we have put some very important 
strategic objectives in place. We've defined the mission of the company 
clearly." 
</P>
<P>
He said there is "no question" that profit will recover over the next few 
years, even if the economy stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley predicts that customer traffic in the stores will grow briskly as the 
company's store remodeling program gains momentum. "We get a very major profit, 
and sales pop, when we modernize stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he says, the shifting of sales clerks to a commission-based pay system 
in the late 1980s will yield further gains. At the same time, Hawley says, 
expenses will be curbed by a continuing consolidation of back-office and 
administrative operations. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley says the company also will benefit from new top management installed 
over the past two years at every Carter Hawley division other than its flagship 
Broadway-Southern California chain. The management changes came at 
Phoenix-based Broadway-Southwest, Emporium in the Bay Area, Sacramento's 
Weinstocks chain and Richmond-based Thalhimers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 180-degree change from what had been going on," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley points to the Broadway store in Montclair as an example of what he 
expects to happen throughout the company. Two of the store's floors were 
renovated in 1986, and it also is one of the locations where Carter Hawley is 
making an extra effort to improve customer service through its "model store" 
program. The result: Sales have risen 51.6% over the past four years, versus 
12.5% for the company overall. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley followers also are looking for a spurt in revenue when the 
company reopens its earthquake-ravaged Emporium store in Oakland on Friday, 
opens a new Broadway location in Santa Barbara on Aug. 17 and replaces an old 
Thalhimers in Winston-Salem, N.C., in October. Analysts are hopeful that the 
rampant price-cutting competition among department stores the past year will 
ease, boosting profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
But many others who follow the company say recent developments are not enough 
to perk up Carter Hawley, given its history of weak profits. Hawley "is still 
the same optimist he was 25 years ago. He's not a realist," said Robert F. 
McCullough, chairman of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello. The San Francisco 
investment firm is Carter Hawley's No. 2 shareholder, with nearly 8% of its 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Value Line Investment Survey, Carter Hawley's 
profitability has lagged the retailing industry average every year since 1975. 
The charges from the 1987 restructuring wiped out the company's slim net 
profits the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
The company still faces big obstacles. Burdened with heavy junk bond debts 
since reorganizing, it needs plenty of income just to make its interest 
payments, let alone pay for remodelings. Yet the retailing industry is in the 
midst of a competitive blood bath that has prompted one debt-heavy store after 
another to seek refuge in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economy isn't cooperating. Analysts are worrying about the 
prospect of a national recession. Closer to home, Southern California is being 
hit by massive aerospace layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
No one is predicting that Carter Hawley will join the roster of retailers in 
bankruptcy. Many analysts believe that operating earnings generally are 
improving or at least stabilizing, and they say the company is bolstered by 
extensive real estate holdings that can be sold or mortgaged for cash. 
</P>
<P>
Also, no big principal payments are due on Carter Hawley's $350 million in junk 
bond debt until 1996. That gives management time to maneuver if -- as expected 
-- suppliers and their lenders stay calm and stick with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Still, debt clouds the company's future. McCullough says he has invested in 
Carter Hawley on the expectation that the company eventually will be bought, 
broken up or run by new management. 
</P>
<P>
For many of Carter Hawley's 37,000 employees, the company's uncertain future is 
particularly troubling, even beyond the issue of whether their jobs could be 
jeopardized someday. Employees own 46% of Carter Hawley's stock through a 
company 401(k) savings plan, a fund through which workers buy company stock, 
typically to supplement their company pension. Yet the stock closed at $5.25 
Friday, near its all-time low and down from $14 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For outside investors who have held Carter Hawley stock since 1986, there is 
the frustration of knowing that their holdings probably would be worth 70% more 
today if the company had accepted a $1.93-billion takeover offer from the 
Limited and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholder activists have charged that Carter Hawley executives ignored the 
interests of investors and acted primarily to save their own jobs when they 
rejected the Limited-DeBartolo bid. "It was an outrageous example of management 
efforts to entrench itself," said James E. Heard, managing director of the 
Analysis Group. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is no assurance that the raiders would have fared 
better with Carter Hawley. DeBartolo, for his part, also happened to be a 
partner with developer Robert Campeau in a disastrous foray into the department 
store business. 
</P>
<P>
To fend off raiders, Carter Hawley reorganized in 1987 by recapitalizing and 
spinning off its specialty chains -- the Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and 
Contempo Casuals stores. They had accounted for nearly one-third of Carter 
Hawley's sales and half its profit. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley, one of the company's namesakes (the company changed its name from 
Broadway-Hale Stores to Carter Hawley Hale in 1974), dismisses the shareholder 
activists' charges. He notes that shareholders overwhelmingly approved the 
restructuring that headed off the takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Hawley says, shareholders had plenty of time between the announcement 
of the overhaul in December, 1986, and its execution in September, 1987, to 
sell their stock at $60 or more in the open market. Company officials say that 
indicates that the restructuring plan was at least as good as the 
Limited-DeBartolo offer, and they believe Carter Hawley is better off being 
owned largely by its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts today ridicule the financial projections made for the 
reorganization in 1987. But the company's supporters say the Bay Area 
earthquake and the difficulties in the department store business are partly to 
blame. "That was outside of management's control," said Robert W. Gordon, a 
vice president with Bank of America, the company's principal lender. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley concedes that he was over-optimistic. He says that one of the main 
problems was that he didn't anticipate how long it would take to arrange 
financing for what he views as the crucial store remodeling effort. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawley proudly defends his approach to financing the company. By taking its 
time, he says, the company has been able to raise funds at relatively 
attractive interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, it has raised more and more of its cash by mortgaging its real estate. 
Just last week, the company raised $30 million in a mortgage deal, and Hawley 
says real estate remains a solid source of financing despite the general 
softness in California property values. 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that other debt-heavy retailers that relied more on junk bond 
financing have gotten into serious trouble, particularly the Campeau Corp. 
department store divisions, which filed for bankruptcy court protection in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have room to indulge in paying that kind of price for money," said 
Hawley. "Has that made operating the last three years more difficult? You bet 
it has." 
</P>
<P>
Operating the business may be even tougher than executives acknowledge. Analyst 
Barre W. Littel of First Boston, who just published a report on Carter Hawley, 
maintains that the financial measure that the company cites as the most 
accurate indicator of its performance doesn't tell the full story. The 
financial yardstick in question is earnings before interest and taxes, known in 
the financial community as EBIT. 
</P>

Investors and analysts typically are more interested in a company's actual 
profit. But Carter Hawley and other companies argue that EBIT reflects how well 
they would do if they were not burdened with heavy debts and thus signals what 
can be expected of them once their debts are retired. 
</P>
<P>
In Carter Hawley's case, EBIT climbed from $66.9 million in 1984 to $172.8 
million in 1989 and is up slightly for the first nine months of this fiscal 
year, despite the Bay Area quake. Littel points out that part of the EBIT 
increase over the past two years has come from expansion of the company's 
credit card business. The trouble, Littel says, is that EBIT reflects the extra 
credit card revenue, but not the extra costs. 
</P>
<P>
If you add in the costs, Littel says, Carter Hawley's performance appears to 
have been flat last year and down this year. Carter Hawley rejects Littel's 
conclusions, saying that he miscalculated the costs of its credit card program. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, Hawley acknowledges that Carter Hawley's EBIT remains well below 
par for the industry. Moreover, Carter Hawley also lags in other measures of 
performance watched by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the sales per square foot at its Broadway-Southern California 
stores -- the region's biggest department store chain, with 43 outlets -- are 
lower than those at Nordstrom, Bullock's and Robinson's and barely exceed those 
at May Co. California. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kurt Barnard, publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report: "Carter 
Hawley has some very real problems on its hands, problems in terms of 
marketing, merchandising and customer appeal. Above all, I think Carter Hawley 
is in a quandary as to who its target customer is, and how to reach that 
customer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW CARTER HAWLEY'S OUTSIDE INVESTORS FARED 
</P>
<P>
Most outside investors would be better off today if Carter Hawley Hale Stores 
had accepted the takeover offers made for the company in 1984 and 1986. The 
following shows how outside shareholders would have fared with either takeover 
offer versus how they actually fared. 
</P>
<P>
Outside shareholders are considered to be investors other than employees and 
General Cinema Corp., which was Carter Hawley's largest shareholder before 
Carter Hawley restructured in 1987. Under the restructuring, investors received 
one share of the Neiman Marcus Group and $17 in cash for each share of Carter 
Hawley they owned. They also kept their Carter Hawley stock. 
</P>
<P>
What investors would have today if Carter Hawley accepted the $35-a-share offer 
in 1984: $62.00 per share. 
</P>
<P>
What investors would have today if Carter Hawley accepted the $60-a-share offer 
in 1986: $83.85 per share. 
</P>
<P>
What investors who bought Carter Hawley stock in 1984 actually have today -- 
$47.94 per share. 
</P>
<P>
All figures assume that proceeds and dividends under each scenario were 
reinvested at a 10% annual rate of return, a return that is lower than the 
performance of the overall stock market during the period.

FAMILY SAVINGS, THE BLACK-OWNED S&amp;L, APPEARS ON MEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Family Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the nation's third-largest 
black-owned thrift institution, had many of the same problems that have led 
other thrifts to fail. 
</P>
<P>
It had money-losing real estate holdings and heavy operating expenses stacked 
onto an under-funded capital base. It had strayed from its traditional 
business, residential mortgages, to try its hand at commercial lending. It had 
a leader, former Chairman Oliver A. Trigg Jr., who left his post under the 
cloud of a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the similarities end there. 
</P>
<P>
Family so far has managed to survive. Under new ownership since January, the 
Los Angeles-based thrift -- renamed Family Federal Savings Bank -- has taken 
several dramatic steps to get back on its feet: 
</P>
<P>
* It has switched its emphasis back to mortgage lending. For the first six 
months of 1990, it has made $26 million in mortgage loans, versus $31 million 
for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
* It has slashed operating expenses from more than $500,000 a month in 1987 to 
about $360,000 a month now, through wage freezes, layoffs and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
* It has sold off, and taken losses on, large chunks of real estate holdings 
put on the books while Trigg was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
The moves have produced some encouraging financial results. After losing more 
than $3 million over the last three years, Family expects to eke out a small 
operating profit this year, according to its chief financial officer, Ed 
Wilson. The thrift, with a main office at 3683 Crenshaw Blvd. and a Pasadena 
branch, has assets of about $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Family still faces major challenges. Late last year, regulators were poised to 
push the thrift into receivership after determining that it was $4 million 
short of federal capital requirements. The regulators placed Family under 
restrictions that require it to provide the Office of Thrift Supervision with 
frequent updates on its financial status. The monitoring has continued, even 
after Family's new owners invested an additional $4 million to bring capital up 
to the required levels. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort began last January when Washington, D.C.-based OFC Inc., a 
black-run venture capital firm, took control of Family by buying 51% of its 
stock for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
OFC had hoped to address Family's $4-million capital shortfall by offering 
stock to investors in a private placement, but there were no takers. So OFC 
covered the entire shortfall -- investing $4 million last May in exchange for 
more Family stock, which brought OFC's ownership level to 93%. 
</P>
<P>
OFC inherited -- and kept -- a management team headed by President Wayne-Kent 
Bradshaw. Bradshaw, a former Union Bank executive, was hired in July, 1989, to 
stop the financial hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would take time to turn things around," Bradshaw said, recalling his 
thoughts on his first few days in charge. "Family was headed in the wrong 
direction. But an institution is like an aircraft carrier in the ocean -- you 
can't simply spin it around in another direction. First, it takes time to stop. 
Second, it takes time to gradually turn the ship around." 
</P>
<P>
The Family ship followed an unusual course during the two years that Oliver 
Trigg had the helm. 
</P>
<P>
Trigg, a Los Angeles real estate investor, became heavily involved in the 
day-to-day management of Family after joining the thrift's board in 1986, some 
Family executives say. Under Trigg, Family stepped up its commercial lending 
and made direct investments in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
One such investment is the subject of a federal investigation into possible 
fraud at the thrift. The grand jury probe, begun in 1988, was prompted by an 
October, 1987, Times story that said a company formed by Trigg had sold land to 
Family for a large profit while Trigg was on the thrift's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1989 lawsuit, Family accused Trigg of using $1.2 million in profit from 
the land deal to buy his 51% stake in Family's stock in 1987. The suit also 
charges that Trigg made financial deals without his fellow directors' 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Trigg has denied making money on the land deal, which involved a residential 
tract in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Arthur Barens, also defends Trigg's performance at Family. Although 
the thrift suffered a major loss in 1987, its earnings reached an all-time high 
-- $1.6 million -- in 1986, Barens said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Trigg) did an exemplary job," Barens said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, attorneys for Trigg and Family have been negotiating to try to settle 
their civil dispute out of court. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no indictments by the grand jury, but its investigation 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
Family executives say they were unable to resell at a profit the land that 
Trigg allegedly foisted on the thrift. Under terms of an agreement with federal 
regulators, Trigg agreed in June, 1988, to place the stock in a trust fund and 
allow proceeds from its sale to revert to Family to make up for its losses on 
the Whittier land. 
</P>
<P>
Under OFC, Family has finally begun to turn around, Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
According to unaudited financial reports, the thrift had earnings of about 
$900,000 in the first six months of the year. However, $850,000 of that was a 
non-recurring gain resulting from Trigg's agreement. When OFC bought the stock 
for $850,000, regulators allowed Family to count the proceeds as income related 
to the Whittier land. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Family is on a financial track that will lead to second-half earnings 
and year-end profits, said Wilson, the chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Including the $850,000 OFC investment, Wilson projects full-year earnings of $1 
million. The thrift had a loss of about $825,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Family now has a different management style," Wilson said. "If we're going to 
provide a better service to the community, we have to have the right resources 
and we have to watch the bottom line and control our expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Expenses have been cut dramatically since 1987, when Family registered a loss 
of $1.1 million. Expenses dropped from $6.6 million in 1987 to $4.9 million at 
the end of 1989. The cost-cutting has accelerated since OFC took control in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners reduced expenses through wage freezes, small staff cuts and 
reductions in advertising, office and travel expenses. Monthly expenses totaled 
$513,000 last December, but by June they had dropped to $360,000, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest expense -- the money paid on deposits -- has been another problem at 
Family. Interest costs rose from $10.3 million in 1987 to $11.7 million in 1989 
as Family offered higher returns on certificates of deposits to attract 
much-needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
However, Family executives say they are now steering away from the costliest 
deposits -- $100,000 "jumbo" certificates of deposit. Instead, they plan to 
emphasize long-term certificates of deposit in lower denominations and at lower 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Family executives say the thrift suffered heavy losses primarily because large 
sums that could have been used for mortgage loans were spent on real estate. 
And many of the real estate investments went bad, as Family's attempts at land 
development failed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Family's interest income on mortgage loans was virtually flat 
between 1987 and 1989 because the thrift wasn't generating many loan 
applications, Wilson said. Loan-related interest income totaled $12.628 million 
in 1987 and rose to only $12.684 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain more cash and make more mortgage loans, Family has been rapidly 
selling off its real estate. In 1987, the thrift's real estate portfolio had 
holdings valued at $8.8 million and losses of about $3.4 million. By the end of 
1989, the holdings were valued at $1.4 million and the losses had fallen to 
$136,221. As of June, the portfolio was valued at about $500,000, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Family's unaudited reports from the first six months of 1990 show other major 
changes. The thrift has made $26 million in loans during the first half of 
1990, compared to only $31 million in all of 1989. And all of the 1990 loans 
were mortgage-related. About 85% of Family's $140 million in assets are 
mortgage loans, compared to 79% at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Family's new orientation actually mirrors the philosophy of its founder -- M. 
Earl Grant. Family has traditionally catered to the borrowing needs of black 
home buyers in the Los Angeles area. An Altadena businessman, Grant founded 
Family in 1948 because he -- like other blacks in that era -- had difficulty 
getting mortgage loans from white-run banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Family's neighborhood has changed as large numbers of Latinos have 
moved in, in recent years. Family is now making marketing and personnel changes 
to attract Latino depositors, said Ron Walker, president of OFC and the 
recently installed chairman of Family Federal. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't survive if we don't seek new markets and address the changing 
demographics of the community," said Walker, a Harlem-born accountant. "Family 
is African-American-owned, but its orientation will be multicultural." 
</P>
<P>
Latinos already receive between 30% and 40% of Family's loans, but they account 
for only about 10% of Family's depositors, Walker said. To lure more Latino 
depositors, Family is now advertising in La Opinion, a Spanish-language 
newspaper in Los Angeles. The thrift has also tried to accommodate current and 
potential customers by hiring more Spanish-speaking tellers. It also hired a 
chief lending officer who is of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
Family -- currently dependent on a customer base that is mainly over 40 years 
of age -- is also trying to generate more deposits and loan applications from 
people in the 25-to-40 age range, Walker said. He said he is trying to develop 
services and programs to attract young professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a disproportionate number of senior citizens -- and they are very good 
customers," Walker said. "But we need younger upscale black and Hispanic 
customers."

Waste Disposal Antitrust Suit: A class-action suit filed in U.S. District Court 
accuses a major provider of waste disposal services, Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc. 
and its subsidiary, GSX Corp., of federal and state antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
Lok-Fast Inc. of Newport Beach claims that from early 1985 until 1989 the 
defendants and unnamed co-conspirators allocated among themselves Orange County 
customers for commercial and industrial trash hauling services at artificially 
high prices. The suit, which seeks unstated treble damages, was filed on behalf 
of at least 500 entities who bought the services and who allegedly lost the 
benefits of open competition. (Filed July 31, 1990. Case No. 90-4041)

Reynolds to Stop Some Recycling: Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Co. will 
discontinue recycling glass and plastic beverage containers at three centers 
because it says provisions of California law are forcing the aluminum industry 
to subsidize glass and plastic recycling. Because redemption prices for glass 
and plastic containers fail to cover their recycling costs, the company may end 
up spending $1 million this year "subsidizing the recovery of glass and plastic 
for recycling," according to Charles W. Rayfield, vice president and general 
manager of Reynolds' Orange-based recycling subsidiary.

GASOLINE PRICES TO DEALERS SOAR BY 9.5 CENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gasoline dealers paid 9.5 cents more per gallon last week for regular unleaded 
gasoline after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, a survey of suppliers indicated 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lundberg Survey of wholesale prices, the amount gasoline dealers pay for 
their product, showed that nationwide average prices Friday rose to 76.5 cents 
a gallon among the most price-sensitive wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, taken weekly, covers 75% to 80% of U.S. suppliers of refined 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Figures gathered since Friday indicate a weekend of increases. Rough estimates 
showed that prices from the most price-sensitive suppliers have gone up another 
6 cents, survey chief Trilby Lundberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil bought at last week's higher prices won't be refined and flowing from 
U.S. gasoline pumps for about a month. But Lundberg and an oil company 
spokesman said increases in the spot market for gasoline translate into higher 
pump prices more quickly during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Many oil companies sell more gasoline than they refine during the summer 
months, so they have to supplement their supplies by buying on the volatile 
spot market, said John Lord, a spokesman for Mobil Oil Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The refinery industry is cranking out every gallon of gasoline it can and 
still has to buy on the spot market. The impact on the gasoline distributing 
system is faster than ever," Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Lord also said many are apparently anticipating higher costs from the 
Iraq-Kuwait conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"When you know future costs are going to go up, if you can recover some of 
those costs today, you're going to do it if the price will hold," Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
Other increases over the week for the same grade of gasoline were 4.73 cents to 
a level of 74.5 cents a gallon for middle-market distributors, and 2.55 cents 
to just over 78 cents a gallon for the most stable part of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, estimates show that prices in the middle market have risen 3.25 
cents, and in the upper -- or most stable -- market 3.50 cents, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The most price-sensitive are the independent wholesalers that have few, if any, 
long-term contracts with gasoline dealers and meet demand by getting supplies 
on the spot market. 
</P>
<P>
The most stable are those who deliver branded gasoline to stations under a 
contract.

MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
SOME SURPRISING SELLOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone agrees that the stock market had good reason to plunge on the 
Iraq-Kuwait news and rising recession worries. But some analysts are 
flabbergasted by the destruction that certain stocks are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Why has Hawthorne-based Mattel, for example, been knocked from $26.375 in May 
to $18 now, a decline of 32% even while the toy company's earnings remain very 
healthy? Why has AST Research, the Irvine computer firm, seen its stock tumble 
from $25.50 in May to $20 now, a 22% decline, even after reporting record 
fourth-quarter earnings? 
</P>
<P>
There may be a simpler answer here than many analysts want to admit. Some of 
the hardest-hit stocks are those that have more than doubled over the past 
year. Some investors bought Mattel for as little as $9.375 in 1989. AST sold 
for as little as $6.625 in 1989. If those lucky buyers still have their shares, 
you can bet they've been more inclined to sell lately than to hold, given the 
rampant fear in the market. After all, no one who was smart enough to buy low 
wants to watch his big paper profits evaporate. It's a basic human emotion. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, the selling will exhaust itself. And the stocks that still 
promise good earnings in the years ahead are likely to find a new herd of 
buyers waiting to rush in, maybe sooner than later. 
</P>
<P>
Stock Buybacks to the Rescue? In the market crash of October, 1987, many 
companies helped rescue stock prices by buying up their own shares on the 
market. A company justified that use of cash by arguing that its stock had 
fallen too low relative to the true value of the company. So the stock may have 
been the best investment that the firm could make at the time. Besides, in 
retiring shares, a company's future earnings are spread over fewer shares -- a 
bonus for remaining investors. 
</P>
<P>
Could stock buybacks keep the market from crashing this time around? Many 
experts doubt that companies can be a major prop for Wall Street. For one 
thing, the crash of '87 was largely driven by computerized program trading. So 
many companies felt that the severity of the plunge was unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
"This time, it's a genuine economic shock" driving stock prices lower, notes 
one economist. Given that reality, it might be difficult for many corporate 
treasurers to argue that their stocks are truly worth buying, especially if a 
firm's business already is slowing with the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason why buybacks are less likely this time around: Many firms just 
don't have the cash. Corporate earnings have generally been weak, in contrast 
to the robust profit levels of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some buybacks will certainly occur, the lower stocks go. General 
Electric last autumn said it would spend $10 billion buying back stock over the 
next five years. The company won't say what it does on a daily basis, but 
"we're in there virtually every day," said spokesman George Jamison. Through 
June 30, GE had spent $1.5 billion to retire 22.9 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
AST Research, mentioned above, recently authorized its treasurer to repurchase 
up to 1.5 million of the company's 15.6 million shares. Joel Don, a spokesman, 
wouldn't give specifics but said the company was a buyer of its own stock last 
week, including Friday. AST stock fell as low as $18.875 Friday before 
rebounding to close up 25 cents at $20. 
</P>
<P>
Using Stop-Loss Orders: To sleep better at night, many investors use stop-loss 
orders on their stocks. For each issue in your portfolio, you leave standing 
instructions with your broker to sell automatically if the price falls to a 
specific level. For example, if you bought a stock at $40, and it's now at $60, 
you might tell the broker to stop-loss it at $50, to guarantee at least a 25% 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
But are stop-loss orders realistic in a free-falling market? For relatively 
small transactions -- several hundred shares or so -- brokers say the system 
does indeed work well for the individual investor. You may not get exactly your 
stop-loss price if the market is plummeting, but your order should at least be 
executed at the first bid price under your stop-loss limit. 
</P>
<P>
But stop-loss orders can only be used for New York Stock Exchange stocks and to 
some degree for American Stock Exchange stocks. There's no stop-loss system for 
over-the-counter stocks. The exchanges have individual trading "specialists" 
who single-handedly keep trading orderly -- and determine prices -- for each 
stock on the exchange floor. The OTC system, in contrast, is a network of 
computer-linked brokers nationwide, all listing various buy and sell prices for 
individual stocks. The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which operates the 
OTC system, argues that there's no way to adequately execute standing stop-loss 
orders within that system. 
</P>
<P>
Even with exchange-listed stocks, a stop-loss order isn't always a smart 
option. If your stock plunges temporarily, only to rebound later in the trading 
day, you may end up seeing the stock sold simply because it briefly touched 
your target price. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Another reason why oil stocks probably only have further to rise this 
year, even if they drop back a bit temporarily: Big money managers still are 
woefully underweighted in the stocks. Many institutional investors dumped the 
oils in the late '80s, as oil prices plunged. They've been slow to buy back 
into the group. CDA Investment Technologies, which tracks institutions' 
holdings, says international oil stocks made up only 4.4% of institutions' 
portfolios on March 30. In contrast, the international oils made up 7.2% of the 
S&amp;P 500 index value. So just to reach a normal market weighting, 
institutions need more oil stocks. Likewise, domestic oil stocks made up 3.5% 
of institutions' portfolios, versus a 4.2% S&amp;P weighting. Only in oil 
services were institutions even with the S&amp;P on March 30: 1.1%. . . .

Sign of the times on Wall Street: Seat sales on the New York Stock Exchange and 
the American Stock Exchange on Friday fetched the lowest prices since January, 
1985. An NYSE seat changed hands for $330,000; two Amex seats changed hands, 
one for $117,500, the other for $115,000. A seat represents a brokerage's 
membership position on an exchange.

WALL STREETERS FIND THIS MARKET A TOUGH CALL 
</P>

"Buy low, sell high." That simple phrase has been the ticket to big profits on 
Wall Street since the stock market began. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, however, is figuring out what exactly is high and what is low. 
Even the most skilled of Wall Street's analysts acknowledge that they often 
can't make that call accurately. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Dow Jones industrial index plunging nearly 200 points in just a 
little more than two weeks, some are wondering whether the market has hit a 
near-term low. In other words, this just might be the ideal time to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the potential dangers, both domestic and international, already have 
been reflected in market prices," said Geraldine Weiss, editor and publisher of 
Investment Quality Trends in La Jolla. "I don't think the market will 
immediately retrace what it lost. There are too many things to work out first. 
But by the end of the year, I expect the market will at least retest the 3,000 
level (on the Dow), and I think it will go significantly higher." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Green, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, noted that during 
the past week the market has absorbed a number of shocks. 
</P>
<P>
First, government figures on the gross national product were revised, revealing 
a much weaker-than-expected economy. Then, stocks were buffeted by a series of 
worse-than-expected earnings reports, with companies ranging from Transamerica 
to Xerox reporting sliding quarterly profits. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Friday, the government released unemployment figures that were 
shockingly weak, Green added. Most economists were expecting modest growth in 
employment during July, but payrolls actually shrank by 219,000 jobs during the 
month. Although the number was skewed by the layoff of about 160,000 temporary 
census workers, it still translated into the highest national unemployment rate 
in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Worse still was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which threw international oil 
production into question and sent prices skyward. That revived the market's 
worst nightmare: "stagflation" -- a stagnant economy coupled with high 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Stagflation would discourage the Federal Reserve from paring interest rates, 
which could devastate corporate earnings and stock prices, market experts 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very unpleasant set of circumstances for equity prices," lamented 
David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the stock market absorbed all of this negative news and still was 
able to hold up above the 2,800 level is actually a bullish sign, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
"If what has driven the market so far is based on fundamentals, we have 
probably gotten through the worst of it, and there could be some real buying 
opportunities," Green added. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that the stocks of healthy companies, which only a few weeks ago 
carried relatively high price/earnings ratios, are now trading at much more 
attractive levels (see chart). 
</P>
<P>
R. Earl Hadady, president of Hadady Corp. and publisher of the Bullish 
Consensus newsletter in Pasadena, agrees: "In general, we are looking for a 
positive market this week. Typically, we tend to see the pendulum swing too far 
one way or the other, and I think it went too far on the negative side." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Peter G. Eliades, publisher and editor of Stockmarket Cycles in Los Angeles, 
said he thinks that the market could rally over the next few weeks. But after 
that, he is calling for a long-term slide in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the week's losses, stock prices are still high when you look at 
historic trends, he said. And he sees further dangers from the fact that, even 
when the market has rallied, only a small percentage of stocks were soaring. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the probability is increasing that we are about to see a major stock 
market top," he said. After that, prices are likely to continue tumbling for 
two or three years, Eliades predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Market experts at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets also believe that the market is 
vulnerable to a major drop. 
</P>
<P>
"Our valuation models still show a market that is 15% to 20% overvalued," said 
Richard Bernstein, Merrill's manager of quantitative analysis. "If the economic 
reports continue to show a weakening economy and the situation in the Middle 
East doesn't clear up, it is the worst possible combination for stocks." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (last week) cleansed the market of a lot of selling that would usually 
take three weeks to three months to work itself out," Weiss said. "The market 
has already discounted a great deal of bad news, and the market never discounts 
the same news twice." 
</P>
<P>
Added Green: "The data shows that the economy has already gone through a period 
of serious weakness -- what economists have been calling the 'soft landing.' 
But the soft landing has already occurred, and we are now taxiing down the 
runway waiting to take off again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW STOCKS HAVE FALLEN 
</P>
<P>
The market's plunge so far has been much worse for some stocks than others. 
Here are 20 stocks in four industries, and where the stocks stand relative to 
earnings, a basic value measure. The P/E, or price-earnings ratio, is the stock 
price divided by the most recent 12 months' earnings per share. A high P/E 
usually means investors expect the firm's earnings to grow at a 
faster-than-average pace.

MIRACLE ESCAPE FROM BAD TV STATION PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anybody can make money for people by putting them into a good investment at a 
low price. The real trick is to get out alive if you put people into a bad 
investment at a high price -- a trick that J. Bruce Llewellyn has carried off 
by finding someone to rescue his unfortunate purchase of a Buffalo, N.Y., TV 
station at what turned out to be an excessive price. 
</P>
<P>
In a deal that borders on the miraculous, Llewellyn has managed to get 
Prudential Insurance Co. to pay his group 120% of what they invested in the 
station -- and to leave them with 55% ownership to boot. This even though the 
station hadn't come close to making enough money to pay its interest bills 
since the day Llewellyn bought it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's fair to say that Llewellyn, a New York-based deal maker, has made 
the greatest escape seen in Buffalo since the Amazing Randi was stuck into a 
straitjacket, suspended by a crane over Niagara Falls and emerged to tell the 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
Having to fix a problem isn't what anybody had in mind in January, 1986, when 
Llewellyn and his investors bought WKBW from Capital Cities Communications for 
$65 million. The investors included household names like O. J. Simpson, Julius 
Erving, Bill Cosby, former UN Ambassador David McHenry and car dealer Dick 
Gidron. Not to mention money from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which sold $55 
million in junk bonds to help Llewellyn's company, Queen City Broadcasting, buy 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
Cap Cities could avoid capital gains tax on the sale by selling to Queen City 
because Llewellyn and most of his investors are black. Sales of media 
properties to certain minorities qualify for special treatment. This is a silly 
policy that -- as Howard Rudnitsky pointed out in an excellent Forbes magazine 
article last year -- enriches wealthy, white-run media companies and already 
rich members of minority groups. But it's the law. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the Buffalo station to Llewellyn -- as well as another station in New 
Haven, Conn., to a group of Aleutian Indians, both at below-market prices -- 
made Cap Cities look socially conscious. Cap Cities could have gotten the same 
tax break for Buffalo -- but not the same good public relations -- by saying it 
had been forced to sell by the Federal Communications Commission's 
cross-ownership rule. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Corp., which had just 
become Cap Cities' biggest stockholder, owns the Buffalo News, and the rules 
required that Cap Cities sell the station or Buffett sell the paper. 
</P>
<P>
So Cap Cities sold to Llewellyn for a "bargain" $65 million -- $10 million of 
it in a note that required no cash payments until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But even with this break, the station didn't generate enough cash to pay the 
cash part of its interest bill. The reason: Cash flow didn't grow as Llewellyn 
projected. In fact, it barely grew at all. 
</P>
<P>
The station paid its bills by borrowing and by tapping the $10 million in cash 
that Llewellyn and his group had paid to buy their stock. By mid-1989, with TV 
station prices starting to come down, Llewellyn's investors were in big 
trouble. What's more, the day of reckoning on the Cap Cities note is drawing 
near. The note, which will have a face value of $18.4 million, will carry a 
cash interest tab of $2 million or $2.5 million in 1992, depending on how you 
read the fine print. Cap Cities/ABC wouldn't say what the interest rate is. 
"It's a private matter. We have no interest in discussing it," a spokesman 
said. A nice attitude for a company in the news business. 
</P>
<P>
Llewellyn, who is a financial guy -- you don't see him running the TV station 
or his Coke bottler in Philadelphia or the former New York Times Co. cable TV 
operation -- saved everyone by finding Prudential. How he did it, I don't know, 
and he wouldn't tell me. All Prudential would say is, "We did this to make 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Prudential forked over $13 million for 45% of the station, of which $12 million 
went to Llewellyn's investors, who continue to own the partnership that owns 
55% of the station. When you add Prudential's 45% and the pieces owned by 
Llewellyn's white investors, it's reasonably clear that non-minorities own more 
than half the station. But the company is still considered a minority 
enterprise because Llewellyn controls the entity that owns 55%. 
</P>
<P>
Llewellyn says all his investors except Bill Cosby took Prudential's money. "He 
would have had tax problems in his retirement plan" by cashing out his 2% 
interest, Llewellyn said. 
</P>
<P>
In a wonderful irony, Prudential seems to have belatedly realized that the 
station owed too much money to be successful. So the Pru cleverly agreed to 
lend the station money at 11.75% to buy back the 13.5% Goldman Sachs junk bonds 
at 20% or so below face value. The bondholders are happy to get out of a risky, 
illiquid investment, even at a loss. The bondholders' loss, of course, is 
Prudential and Llewellyn's gain. 
</P>
<P>
This stands normal investment rules on their heads. When an investment goes 
bad, bondholders are supposed to be paid first, with stockholders taking the 
loss. Here, stockholders made a profit and the bondholders take a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The station still isn't out of the woods, though. If both Cap Cities and 
Prudential actually insist on getting paid interest on their loans, rather than 
pulling some face-saving stunt, the station won't be able to cover its 1992 
interest payments unless its cash flow goes up substantially. 
</P>
<P>
But that's 1992's problem. And, probably, Prudential's. Llewellyn has gotten 
his investors out alive, which is a pretty neat trick under the circumstances. 
Take a bow, Bruce.

FAMOUS PLANE'S FATE HANGS IN BALANCE OF DISNEY DECISION ON PROJECT 
</P>

Howard Hughes' fantastic flying machine, the Spruce Goose, seemingly has spent 
its entire star-crossed career trying to recapture its one golden moment in the 
sun. The question now is whether the massive seaplane, its wings clipped long 
ago, can survive at all. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans unveiled last week by the Walt Disney Co. for a $2-billion 
resort and theme park in Long Beach exclude the historic flying boat now housed 
on the 300-acre proposed site. But the outcome remains uncertain because Disney 
is undecided about the site and is still considering an alternative site in 
Anaheim, near Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, speculation about what will become of the historic flying boat, 
which has been surrounded by almost as much mystery as the reclusive Hughes 
himself, ranges from the mundane to the fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of dismembering the giant wooden bird for a trip across the 
desert and reassembling it amid the glitz of Hughes' onetime hometown of Las 
Vegas. Other entrepreneurs envision it as a spectacular centerpiece of a large 
real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans who want to see it kept in one piece -- and who say that moving it 
out of Southern California would be like moving Hollywood to the Midwest -- 
favor transporting the entire plane aboard a giant ocean barge, perhaps powered 
by its own propeller engines, to another port city in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are those who, letting their imaginations take flight, speculate 
about what may appear as the simplest solution of all -- letting the old bird 
fly out of Long Beach on its own power. 
</P>
<P>
It would be only its second flight since Hughes piloted the huge airplane on 
its one-minute maiden voyage in 1947, before secreting it away to a hangar. 
With the end of World War II, the giant cargo plane, designed to transport 
tanks and troops, already was destined to be a relic of the pre-jet-propulsion 
age. When Hughes apparently finally admitted that time had passed by the grand 
old flying boat, he had it put away. But he ordered the plane maintained in 
flying order until a few years before his death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Having lost its most loyal patron, the Spruce Goose fell on hard times. Evicted 
from its home by the Port of Long Beach, which needed the land to construct an 
oil tanker terminal, the homeless Goose was to be cut into pieces and scattered 
across the country for display at various aviation museums. The seaplane was 
saved when the management firm that took over the legendary Queen Mary for 
exhibition in Long Beach offered to incorporate the Spruce Goose into the 
nostalgic display. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million people have visited the Spruce Goose and, no doubt, felt 
dwarfed at the sight of the spectacular aircraft's Gargantuan dimensions. The 
craft's wingspan is longer than a football field; its tailspan, the height of 
an eight-story building. 
</P>
<P>
Inside its aluminum dome, the flying boat appears in flight-ready condition and 
rests in the middle of a reflecting pool with its huge wings tied down to the 
floor with heavy metal cables, giving the impression that it might otherwise 
take flight. 
</P>
<P>
The Goose's most avid fans want the plane kept there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a magnificent thing and it's horrible that the possibility exists that we 
will lose it," said Donald E. Madonna, director of the Museum of Flying in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it should stay in Southern California. That's where Howard Hughes 
built it and that's where it belongs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merle Coffee, the radio operator on that day 43 years ago when Hughes 
unexpectedly lifted the Goose off the water after a series of scheduled taxi 
test runs, had looked forward to seeing the Goose take to the skies again. 
</P>
<P>
But Coffee, like scores of others who worked for years carefully crafting the 
giant, could not know the Goose's brief minute aloft would be its last. 
</P>
<P>
It was heartbreaking, said Coffee, now 70, to see the flying boat put away in a 
hangar for 30 years. "It was a waste of manpower," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who had led the effort to save the Goose in the late 1970s was Bill 
Berry, the former director of the entire Spruce Goose project. Proposals back 
then included moving it to the Salton Sea, the San Francisco Bay Area and Las 
Vegas. Even actor John Travolta, an aviation buff, had expressed interest in 
buying it, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
Berry and others opposed a plan to break the plane into pieces to move it, 
which would have ruined its structural integrity. Although they determined that 
flying the Goose would be impractical, Berry said it would not be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Berry and Coffee said they would hate to see the Spruce Goose torn apart to be 
moved and reassembled elsewhere. They said that because of its unique 
construction, the ship could never be put back together in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Nissen Davis, president of the Aero Exhibits Corp., which owns the 
Spruce Goose on behalf of the Aero Club, believe that such "purist" attitudes 
are a luxury the campaign to save the Goose can ill afford. 
</P>
<P>
(In 1981, the government turned the plane over to the nonprofit Aero Club 
corporation to facilitate leasing it to Wrather Corp. Wrather is the management 
company that operated the Queen Mary and the Spruce Goose until it sold both 
leases to the Disney Co.) 
</P>
<P>
Although "not anxious" for a move that would require the Spruce Goose to be 
dismantled, Davis added that he is a "realist" and would not reject out of hand 
any potentially viable proposals -- such as one from a group of investors that 
has expressed interest in moving the craft to Las Vegas as the centerpiece for 
an aviation-related convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Some aviation enthusiasts and even some former Spruce Goose crew members say it 
is too early to start earnestly planning the airplane's next nest. 
</P>
<P>
Disney unveiled its master plan for the 350-acre entertainment complex just 
last week and, it is generally agreed, the long and tortuous approval process 
for the project could take from two to five years. The project could also fall 
apart at any stage if the various entities involved -- including the city, the 
California Coastal Commission and Disney -- fail to come to terms. Even if 
approved, completion of the theme park could take as long as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are pessimistic about the Spruce Goose finding a home at all 
because of the great expense and enormously difficult logistics of moving the 
oversized plane. Thus, some argue that it is not too early to begin a new 
effort to ensure preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of people are speculating and coming up with different 
possibilities. It gets a lot of people's juices flowing," said Davis, of the 
Aero Club. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to see it stay where it is. But I have to be pragmatic," Davis 
added. The plane's future home will be determined through negotiations between 
the Aero Club, Disney and Hughes' Summa Corp., which still has a say in the 
plane's fate, Davis said. Disney has promised to help find a suitable home for 
the Spruce Goose, Davis said.

MEASURE M BACKERS BELIEVE UEBERROTH COULD BE THE KEY 
</P>

He is well known, well respected and credible. And even though he has never 
held elective office or built a highway, Orange County leaders of a proposed 
half-cent transportation sales tax think Laguna Beach resident Peter Ueberroth 
may be just what they need. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, president of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and a 
former commissioner of baseball, brings none of the political baggage to a 
campaign that most business leaders do. He is not a developer, which allows him 
to evade that stigma. And because he holds no elective office, voters can 
hardly toss him out for supporting a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, "he's a very, very popular person with enormous credibility," 
said Dana Reed, chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission and 
Measure M's chief backer. "He'd be a tremendous asset to the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said Friday that Ueberroth has been asked to play a "very significant" 
role in the effort, perhaps even as campaign chairman. Ueberroth has not yet 
responded, Reed said, adding that even if the former Olympic chairman is too 
busy to serve as chairman, local leaders would still like to involve him 
somehow. Ueberroth was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Before Measure M backers can launch their push for November, they need to get 
past a vote by county supervisors Tuesday. The board will consider whether to 
put the proposal on the ballot, and though the supervisors' have characterized 
that vote as merely a procedural formality, Measure M opponents are lobbying 
hard to knock the proposed sales tax out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
Only three supervisors -- Thomas F. Riley, Don R. Roth and Roger R. Stanton -- 
plan to attend Tuesday's session. If any one of them votes against putting the 
measure on the ballot, that will end the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reed has commissioned a pair of Sacramento political consultants to 
draft a campaign strategy, which should be complete this week if the measure 
makes it past the board. 
</P>
<P>
David Townsend, president of Townsend &amp; Co., one of the firms that is 
drafting the campaign primer, said it is too early to speculate on who might 
lead Orange County's effort, but agreed that it would be helpful to have 
someone "with a lot of credibility in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth seems to fit that bill. He openly supported the previous version of 
Measure M, and a recent poll of county voters found that Ueberroth enjoys a 70% 
favorable rating in Orange County, with only 2% of those questioned expressing 
an unfavorable impression. 
</P>
<P>
Only President Bush did better on the positive side, racking up a 73% favorable 
rating, and Bush carries an 18% unfavorable rating. Ueberroth's numbers even 
edged out former football running back O.J. Simpson and actress Bette Midler, 
both of whom also have houses in Laguna Beach.

Ventura County's crime rate is the lowest in the West for counties with at 
least one city of 50,000 or more residents, according to FBI statistics 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And while crime rates for both the nation and state of California increased 
from 1988 to 1989, FBI figures show that the crime rate in Ventura County 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County had 3,813.9 crimes per 100,000 people in 1989, the second 
consecutive year that the county has had the lowest crime rate in the western 
United States for counties with at least one city of 50,000 or more people. 
That compared to a rate of 3,875.6 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the 1989 crime rate for the entire United States was 5,741 crimes 
per 100,000 residents, an increase from a rate of 5,664.2 the previous year. 
California had a rate of 6,763.4 in 1989 and 6,635.5 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring counties in California also showed higher rates than Ventura County 
during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County had a rate of 7,424.2 crimes per 100,000 people. San Diego 
County had a rate of 7,362.3 and Orange County's rate was 5,939.4. Santa 
Barbara had a rate of 5,098.5. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, murders were down from 28 in 1988 to 20 in 1989. Rapes, 
assaults and larceny also declined slightly. Robberies, burglaries and motor 
vehicle thefts increased. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials said they did not attribute any significance to the 
decline in murders. 
</P>
<P>
"Homicides are inexplicable," said Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. "Most 
murders cannot be deterred because they are crimes of passion." 
</P>
<P>
The annual FBI report includes statistics on the violent offenses of murder, 
rape, robbery and assault. Property crimes of burglary, larceny and motor 
vehicle theft also are counted. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ventura County is the safest county west of Bismarck, 
N.D., among counties with at least one city or urban area of 50,000 or more 
people. There are more than 30 other counties in that category with lower crime 
rates than Ventura County's, all east of Bismarck. The report did not look at 
sparsely populated rural counties, many of which traditionally have very low 
crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI noted that many factors affect crime rates and that comparisons of one 
city to another are sometimes rendered meaningless because of differences in 
the ways that police departments report crime. Some departments simply do a 
better job than others of identifying crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials attributed Ventura County's low crime rates to a variety of 
factors, including the absence of large pockets of poverty that sometimes breed 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time there's a city of lower socioeconomic levels, it will have additional 
crime," Bradbury said. "I imagine the reverse of that is that we're a fairly 
affluent community." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officials noted the county's reputation as being aggressive in 
prosecuting and sentencing criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura County's reputation is for being on the hanging side of the criminal 
justice system," said Undersheriff Larry Carpenter of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
County officials cited the district attorney's policy against plea bargaining 
and stiff sentencing by judges as other factors in the county's low crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they believe that Ventura County residents are more willing than 
citizens in many other areas of the state to take action against crime -- 
joining neighborhood watch programs, contributing money to anti-drug programs 
such as DARE and SANE and responding to mailed subpoenas with a 90% return 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
The planning of cities such as Thousand Oaks also deters crime, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. George Conahey of the East Valley Sheriff's Station, which oversees 
Thousand Oaks, said that a police liaison attends the city's Planning 
Commission meeting to offer advice on how buildings can be constructed to 
prevent crime. 
</P>
<P>
Houses must be built so doors are clearly visible from the street, a factor 
that discourages burglars, he said. The city also avoids having alleys behind 
houses and insists on good lighting for parking lots, garages and commercial 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley has a similar program by which the department reviews all building 
plans, said Lt. Bob Klamser of the Simi Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Such planning on the eastern end of the county may provide a buffer between the 
counties of Los Angeles and Ventura, which already is somewhat geographically 
isolated, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Robert Owens of the Oxnard Police Department said he believes that 
predators are more apt to stay within their own communities in Ventura County 
because of geographical boundaries that divide the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to create a sense of community here than in Los Angeles, where 
it's a sprawling, never-ending change of cities," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
But with so many factors, Carpenter said some of the credit for the low crime 
rate still just boils down to luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we create an environment where people want safety and low crime rates," 
he said. "But there are times when it's just luck involved and we accept 
wherever it comes from." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Ventura County cities detailed in the report, Oxnard had the highest 
crime rate, with 5,949.5 crimes per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, murders in Oxnard fell from 11 in 1988 to 6 in 1989. The rate of rape, 
burglary and larceny also fell, continuing what Owens said is a 10-year decline 
in crime in the city. He said demographics account for the city's high crime 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a more blue-collar city," Owens said. "People in lower socioeconomic 
groups tend to deal with disagreements in a more direct and oftentimes violent 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula followed closely with a rate of 5,864.1, while Ventura had a rate 
of 5,414.6. Fillmore had a rate of 3,442.3, Port Hueneme reported a rate of 
3,177.6 and Simi Valley had a rate of 3,127.7. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities with the lowest crime rates in the county were Thousand Oaks, 
with a rate of 2,832.6 crimes per 100,000 people; Moorpark, with a rate of 
2,351 per 100,000 population; and Camarillo, with the lowest crime rate in the 
county at 2,221.4 crimes per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics were not compiled for the city of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's crime rate for 1989 was lower than the 1988 rate of 3,386 crimes 
per 100,000 people, a contrast to a slight increase in crime reported by 
several of the county's other larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Klamser of the Simi Valley Police Department attributed the decline in 
large part to a community that fervently guards against crime. He also said 
that he thinks other communities are affected by some spillover of crime from 
Los Angeles, while Simi Valley is secluded. 
</P>
<P>
"We have limited egress and ingress," Klamser said. "It's not easy for 
criminals to come in."

ANGLERS' ANGST; 
</P>
<P>
FISHING MAY GET EVEN WORSE AS STATE BUDGET CUT STRAINS HATCHERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County anglers may have to reel in their lines now that Gov. George 
Deukmejian has signed the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $1.8 million will be cut from the state Department of Fish and 
Game's budget for freshwater fisheries alone, which will probably force the 
closure of a hatchery in San Bernardino County and another in Imperial County, 
said Mas Yamashita, assistant hatcheries coordinator for the state. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Fillmore Fish Hatchery would be left intact, the closures 
elsewhere would divert a major portion of the rainbow trout grown there to 
lakes and streams outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the state should be doing more to enhance the fisheries. It really is 
a sad turn of events when we hear they're going to be decreased," said Jim 
Donlon, fisherman and chairman of the Ventura County Fish and Game Commission. 
"I've just given up going because the fishing is so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Many local fishing holes are stocked by the 48-year-old Fillmore Fish Hatchery, 
which already faces hardships because of layoffs, manager Jim Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
In May a part-time secretary and two seasonal workers were laid off, Adams 
said. He was promoted from assistant manager to manager in January but has not 
filled his former position. 
</P>
<P>
Running with only 8 1/2 paid staff positions, the hatchery, south of California 
126, breeds about 400,000 pounds of rainbow trout every year. Most of the stock 
is earmarked for freshwater lakes and streams in Kern, Los Angeles, San Luis 
Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
This reduces the number of trout the hatchery can stock in eight lakes and 
streams in Ventura County, among them Lake Casitas and Lake Piru. Fillmore's 
hatchery is one of the largest of the 11 trout-hatching facilities in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County anglers are used to fishing grounds that are regularly stocked 
with rainbow trout for at least half the year. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wagner, park superintendent for the Lake Casitas Recreation Area, said that 
since 1968 Ventura County fishermen have depended on the state and county 
fishing groups to stock bass and trout. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game has a cooperative agreement with local fishing 
associations to match the number of fish stocked at local lakes, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, Lake Casitas was stocked with 27,100 pounds of rainbow 
trout supplied by the state, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Donlon said, the number of trout already planted each year by the state 
has not kept pace with demand. Soon after the trout are stocked, most of the 
fish are caught, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But with the impending cuts, Donlon predicted that fishing would get worse. 
</P>
<P>
Up to a third of the 75,000 pounds of fish usually planted each year in Ventura 
County may go to areas normally supplied by other hatcheries, said Mike Haynie, 
supervisor of regional fish hatcheries for the Department of Fish and Game. 
That means Orange, San Bernardino and San Diego counties may get their supplies 
of trout from Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be moving fish around the state. . . ," Yamashita said. "It's going 
to be a problem everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The Fillmore hatchery houses breeding ponds where the fish grow in four 
1,000-foot-long tanks until they weigh about a third or half a pound. Mature 
fish are then trucked to bodies of fresh water around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the layoffs have left the hatchery short-staffed to feed the fish 
and care for the tanks. He said hatcheries have long been a neglected program 
in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, hatcheries may not have been the highest priority, but 
hatcheries produce the product that sell licenses," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Licenses bought by fishermen statewide provide the $700,000 that finances 
Fillmore hatchery operations each year. Without fish to catch in local lakes, 
Ventura County anglers are unlikely to buy a $21 license, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the cuts in staffing, the Fillmore hatchery will be open to 
visitors every day, as it has for years, Adams said. On one recent weekend, 
Adams greeted busloads of tourists, while simultaneously tackling clerical work 
that had piled up since the secretary was laid off. 
</P>
<P>
The hatchery is open even on Christmas and New Year's Day, Adams said. "You 
never close when you have 1 million mouths to feed."

PARAMEDIC PROVIDER ADDS 3 MOBILE UNITS

Pruner Health Services, a private company contracted by Ventura County to 
provide ambulance service to the east county, has added three mobile paramedic 
units, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles contain life-support equipment, such as fibrillation units and 
cardiac monitors, and are available 24 hours a day, said Doug Greenfield, 
Pruner's director of support services. 
</P>
<P>
The company has ambulance stations in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and 
just outside Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Pruner's Chief Administrative Officer Steve Murphy said growth within the 
company's service area does not warrant a fifth ambulance station, but the 
mobile units will handle an increase in demand. 
</P>
<P>
The units provide "more treatment on the scene without tying up a whole 
ambulance station," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Pruner, which serves about 330,000 people and an area of about 430 square 
miles, is not subsidized by tax revenue, but operates on user fees, Greenfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new vehicles is a four-wheel-drive unit that can be used on rough 
terrain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenfield said that the company's goal is to send paramedics wherever and 
whenever they are needed and that the support vehicles were the most efficient 
and cost-effective way of doing that. SCOTT LAWRENCE

<P>
OCC TO INDUCT 3 INTO HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Coast College will induct three people into its Alumni Hall of Fame next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame was established in 1983 "to recognize outstanding alumni and 
bring the public's attention to the quality of education at Orange Coast 
College," said Doug Bennett, executive director of the Orange Coast College 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
This year's inductees are Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson, Ernie Vitucci, 
general manager of the Orange County Edition of the Times, and Dr. E. Aubrey 
Woodroof, vice president of Wound Care Research and Development at Winthrop 
Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who has also been inducted into the Western State College of Law Hall 
of Fame, was an Orange Coast College student from 1973 to 1975. She was 
admitted to the California Bar and to federal court practice in 1978 and 
elected judge in Fullerton in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Vitucci attended Orange Coast College from 1965 to 1967. He worked at the 
Orange County Register for six months and then at the Orange Coast Daily Pilot 
for seven years. He joined The Times in 1973 in the display advertising 
department. In 1987, he became general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Woodroof graduated from Orange Coast College in 1962 and then received a 
biology degree from San Diego State University. He earned a doctorate in 
biochemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Woodroof developed BioBrane, a biosynthetic wound dressing designed to protect 
wound surfaces while healing occurs. It also protects large burn wounds until a 
skin graft can be performed. Almost transparent, the skin substitute is made of 
proteins derived from pig hide and cartilage, which are bound to a nylon and 
silicone fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The free ceremony, open to the public, will be Sept. 14 at 5 p.m. in the 
college's Fine Arts Hall. The Hall of Fame is in the college's Norman E. Watson 
Library. A reception will follow.

The year-round Gateway Community School in Camarillo has been awarded a $75,000 
grant to discourage student smoking, Principal Phil Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year grant to the Personal Wellness Project will be used for 
instructional materials and the salaries of two part-time physical education 
teachers, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students are at risk of using tobacco, drugs and alcohol, and we don't 
want them using any of these," Gore said. "We're trying to promote healthy 
lifestyles and raise the students' awareness and appreciation for healthier 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
The Wellness Project is a 24-week program targetting about 200 of the school's 
350 seventh- to 12th-grade students, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
The program includes physical activities, instruction on physiology and 
workshops on decision-making and self-esteem. Participants will also be 
encouraged to teach what they have learned to other students. 
</P>
<P>
The program at the Pleasant Valley District school for high risk students will 
begin in September, Gore said. SCOTT LAWRENCE

BYPASS NOT LIKELY SOON, COUNCIL SAYS

<P>
Ojai officials, concerned about the traffic impact of a proposed 50-home 
subdivision in Meiners Oaks, say the county should not take into account a 
bypass that may not be completed for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The county report calls for the developer, John Schuck of the Franciscan-Lowe 
Ojai Venture, to contribute a "fair share" toward building a park-and-ride lot 
along California 33 and toward construction of a new stretch of highway to 
bypass Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai City Council is asking why the bypass is being considered when 
construction is many years away. Ojai Planning Director William Prince said the 
city's response to the environmental report will be presented to the county by 
Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I question the adequacy of that bypass as a mitigation measure," Prince said. 
"It would appear the county should revise the document." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Allen, a planner with the Ventura County Planning Division, said that both 
the time and cost involved to make the road improvements could be prohibitive 
to the developer, depending on how much he is required to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
A one-acre parking lot for 175 vehicles, the report says, would cost $250,000 
to build after $500,000 is spent to acquire the land, at current market value. 
</P>
<P>
Building a Casitas bypass -- a new segment of California 33 proposed from 
Foster Park to Arnaz Grade south of Oak View -- is estimated to cost at least 
$24 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The bypass is not really a viable alternative," Allen said. "Caltrans has not 
put it on its five-year list of projects and state funds for it appear to be 
nonexistent. It's at least 10 or 20 years away." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the Board of Supervisors must decide which measures will be required 
of the developer before the project is approved. "If he can't fulfill those 
decisions, then there's no way he can build," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuck's attorneys are also reviewing the environmental report, a company 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Environmental Report Review Committee will hold a public hearing 
on it Aug. 22 in the County Government Center. THIA BELL

SLICES, HOOKS KEEP COUNTRY CLUB NEIGHBOR DUCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For as long as there have been golf balls and residences on fairways, people 
have endured the damage and fear of errant slices and wild hooks. But since 
most people who live in such houses are golfers, they usually understand the 
vagaries of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Pellico of Agoura Hills isn't a golfer. And he doesn't understand why his 
house is regularly shelled by golf balls when he can't even see the ninth 
fairway of the Lake Lindero Country Club from his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The balls began pelting his house and landing in his yard within weeks after he 
moved in, in early 1989. In May of last year, one broke a second-floor bedroom 
window. He later won a small claims court judgment against the club for $106.54 
to cover his costs in replacing the window and filing the lawsuit. But the 
club, which says golfers are responsible for their own shots, has appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I bought my house, I knew that there was a golf course around here, but 
when I looked at my property, I never ever in a million years would have 
thought I would be getting golf balls in my yard," Pellico said during an 
interview at his house, one lot removed from the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even see the golf course from here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the golf ball shattered the bedroom window, showering his bed with glass, 
Pellico said he called the club and asked that he be reimbursed. According to 
Pellico, a club official refused. 
</P>
<P>
Pellico filed a lawsuit in small claims court in Calabasas and won, but two 
weeks ago he received a notice that the club was appealing the judgment in Van 
Nuys Superior Court. No court date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has been followed with interest by Pellico's neighbors, most of 
whom, like him, were required to join the country club when they bought their 
homes. The club includes a lake and tennis courts as well as the semiprivate, 
nine-hole golf course. Most of the holes on the course are short, par-three 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Tom Teague, who lives across Mainmast Drive from Pellico, even farther 
from the course, estimates that he gets a golf ball a week in his yard. 
</P>
<P>
Retired aerospace worker Jerry Carnes lives on Slicers Circle, about half a 
block away, and said he has collected hundreds of golf balls from his yard and 
pool over 15 years. Carnes said he thinks golfers improperly use woods, rather 
than irons, on the small course and as a result hit balls beyond its 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the course may also contribute to the problem, said Camarillo 
attorney Glenn E. Churchman, who represented a Westlake Village couple that got 
an undisclosed settlement from the North Ranch Country Club in 1988 because 40 
golf balls a month hit their house. 
</P>
<P>
"If you set up golf courses right, you can eliminate the problem," Churchman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Thomas, communications director for the Southern California Golf Assn., 
said he isn't familiar with the Lake Lindero course, but that it would take 
"one big howling slice" for golfers to hit houses so far off the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the club's board of directors, Valerie Fitzharris, noted that 
the golf course existed before the houses were built during the early 1970s and 
therefore buyers should have known that golf balls would land near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Golfer Larry Zerr, who lives on the fairway of the ninth hole, said he's lost 
six windows to golf balls. In some cases, sheepish golfers paid for them, and 
the others were covered by his homeowner's insurance policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zerr built a roof over his patio to protect people sitting in his outdoor spa. 
The first day it was in place, it was hit by a ball. "Unfortunately, the ball 
bounced over and busted my next-door neighbor's window," he said with a 
chuckle. He paid for the window. 
</P>
<P>
Zerr thinks Pellico's lawsuit is frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
"If a kid throws a ball through his window, is he going to sue the city of 
Agoura Hills? If you live near a golf course, you expect golf balls. If you 
live at the marina, you expect fog and rust on your car."

RENOVATED EQUESTRIAN CENTER SADDLED WITH SKEPTICISM; 
</P>
<P>
HORSES: TWO BURBANK RESIDENTS BOUGHT THE GRIFFITH PARK FACILITY FROM THE 
INSOLVENT GIBRALTAR SAVINGS IN FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the three months since a Burbank development firm took over the financially 
troubled Los Angeles Equestrian Center, work crews have painted and repaired 
peeling fences, pulled acres of weeds, planted dozens of rows of flowers and 
towed away abandoned cars rusting behind stables. 
</P>
<P>
And while regular patrons of the center say Del Rey Properties has rescued the 
72-acre facility from disrepair, many remain wary of the future. "Eight years 
we've been here and everyone has promised everything and none of it has ever 
come through," said one horse trainer. 
</P>
<P>
It is that type of skepticism that owners Gregory Daggett and Timothy Behunin 
are finding difficult to overcome as they attempt to make profitable an 
operation that has lost money since it opened in 1982. The two Burbank 
residents bought the center in February from the insolvent Gibraltar Savings 
for $3.6 million. In May, they took control of the facility, which is on 
city-owned land in the northeastern corner of Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the new management has worked to revitalize the deteriorating 
center, which fell into disrepair during the caretaker ownership of Gibraltar. 
A 10-man crew has worked seven days a week just pulling weeds. Dozens of 
dumpsters have been filled with trash and hauled away. Slippery concrete wash 
racks have been improved so horses do not fall as they are washed. Transients 
sleeping in stalls have been evicted. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel good about the change," said Shirley Andrews, a city administrator who 
oversees the center. "For someone to take over an operation that has been 
deteriorating is very hard." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Kenneth Mowry declined to discuss when Del Rey expects to turn 
a profit on the center. 
</P>
<P>
Many patrons acknowledged that Daggett and Behunin face an uphill fight in 
turning the center around. Some protective horse owners said they were 
unsatisfied with Del Rey's operation of the center, but most reserved judgment. 
Many said they feel as though they have been in limbo since Gibraltar took over 
in 1988, when it foreclosed on the facility's previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone is a little nervous," said Beverly Engleberg, who boards a 
horse at the center. "Everybody is kind of watching and waiting." 
</P>
<P>
They are watching for changes in programs that might make the center cheaper to 
run, but would damage its reputation as one of the finest equestrian facilities 
in the United States. Even in its dilapidated condition, the center was 
acknowledged to be among the best riding centers and is home to several 
world-class horse trainers. Some expressed concern that Del Rey would expand 
the services of the center and neglect the basic care of the 645 horses that 
board there. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want restaurants and condos and swimming pools and tennis courts," 
said one trainer. "We just want a place that works." 
</P>
<P>
Daggett said that's what he wants too. He said programs at the center will 
remain intact and expansions will be made only if they can be shown to be 
cost-effective. "Everything has got to be a stand-alone deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the center was primarily a business decision, but Daggett said 
there was a certain amount of sentimentality involved in the decision. Horse 
riders since they were children, Daggett and Behunin spent many weekends of 
their youth riding their horses on the hills overlooking the open fields where 
the center now stands. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is a little bit cowboy at heart," said Daggett, who has run smaller 
stables nearby for several years. "But this was a business move. We hope to 
make money in it." 
</P>
<P>
Mowry said the owners believe they can succeed where others have failed largely 
because their debt service is considerably smaller than that of previous 
owners. According to Andrews, the $3.6 million Del Rey paid for the center is 
little more than a quarter of the approximately $12 million Gibraltar owed on 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mowry said, careful management has helped stem the flow of money. 
A 100-yard chain-link fence, for instance, has been rented since 1982 for $74 a 
month. Mowry said the fence could have been bought several times over with the 
rent money. It will be taken down and replaced with a new fence -- this one 
owned by the center. Andrews said electrical boxes around the facility have 
been padlocked to prevent the surreptitious use of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"The big story is the little things," Mowry said. "It's the small details." 
</P>
<P>
But some boarders and trainers said such cost-consciousness on the part of Del 
Rey has been reflected in the care of their horses. One woman complained that 
she could not get extra shavings used for padding for her horse's stall. 
Another said her horse's stall was not cleaned regularly. Others were anxious 
about the center's decision to feed horses alfalfa cubes, instead of loose hay. 
Several horses died a few years ago as a result of eating cubes contaminated 
with animal parts. 
</P>
<P>
"They ride horses, but they are not horsemen," said one boarder who asked not 
to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Mowry said stalls are cleaned twice a day and that horses whose owners do not 
want them eating cubes are fed loose hay instead. 
</P>
<P>
Daggett said it is understandable that many people are apprehensive about new 
management at the center and added that it might take time for longtime 
boarders to become accustomed to new ways. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can ask people is to judge us by what we do, not by what's been done in 
the past," he said.

COMMITTEE BEGINS STUDY OF CHILD CARE 
</P>

<P>
An ad hoc committee began work last week on its assignment from the City 
Council to study child-care needs and make suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
The group will inventory current programs, public policies and needs; project 
future needs; examine model programs, and define the role of public agencies, 
private nonprofit agencies and local businesses, said Randy Westrick, 
recreation supervisor for Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
City officials began considering the subject of child care earlier this year 
after discussing issues surrounding the city-sponsored preschool. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people realize there are gaps," Westrick said. "The idea of the 
(committee's) report is to quantify and correct where those gaps are." 
</P>
<P>
The 28-member committee includes a cross section of city and school district 
officials, child-care providers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed with the caliber and the range of knowledge of people (at 
last week's meeting)," said Councilwoman Leslie Anne Pontious. "I'm delighted 
to see it off the ground and on its way." 
</P>
<P>
New members are welcome to join the committee, which is scheduled to meet again 
at 7 p.m. Aug. 28 in the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
"But if people come to the meeting, they're going to get put to work," Westrick 
warned. SHANNON SANDS

VETERAN OF CITYHOOD FIGHT HAS NEW BATTLE ON HIS HANDS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA: CARL BOYER III, ONE OF THE FIRST CITY COUNCILMEN, IS THE FIRST 
TO FACE A RECALL EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For two decades Carl Boyer III fought for home rule in the Santa Clarita Valley 
-- a foot soldier in the suburban revolution that culminated when Santa Clarita 
spurned Los Angeles County and incorporated in 1987. He was elected to the 
first City Council and won a new term in April. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a counterrevolution may be in the works. And Boyer is its prime target. 
</P>
<P>
A group of residents -- shouting some of the battle cries Boyer used while 
fighting for cityhood -- is trying to oust him from office in the first recall 
of an elected official attempted in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Unsatisfied Taxpayers, or OUST, says Boyer is 
pro-development, arrogant and unresponsive to citizens. Boyer denies the 
charges. "I feel sad for the community," he said. The recall is a 
"short-sighted action by some people who are really confused by the growth." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer is responsive to citizens, his supporters say, noting that his home 
telephone number is still listed in the telephone book and he even put it on 
his campaign flyers. 
</P>
<P>
But Carmel Sizer, a spokeswoman for OUST, said, "This recall is by public 
demand. They want Carl Boyer out." 
</P>
<P>
The effort has just begun and recall petitions must still be certified by the 
city clerk before the activists can begin collecting the approximately 8,000 
signatures they'll need to force an election. 
</P>
<P>
But the recall movement has already produced some philosophical debate, some 
hardball politics -- and some soul-searching -- in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to oust Boyer has made some people reflect on the role of a council 
member and the nature of local democracy itself. Some see the recall as a fight 
between the city's old guard, of which Boyer is a part, and activists new to 
the political scene. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, the politics of the recall movement became ensnarled in the 
tangled web of personal relationships and rivalries in Santa Clarita. Boyer 
publicly questioned the integrity of Sizer, saying she has launched a personal 
vendetta against him. 
</P>
<P>
Many longtime residents describe Santa Clarita as the largest small town 
around, a gossipy community that could serve as the setting for a soap opera -- 
a Peyton Place with Spanish tile and stucco instead of wood-frame Colonials. 
</P>
<P>
Private lives became public when Boyer revealed that a San Fernando Superior 
Court judge had issued a restraining order in May that forbids Sizer from 
harassing or contacting him, his family or Leon Worden, who is engaged to one 
of Boyer's three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The order was prompted by tempestuous conflicts between Sizer and Worden, who 
lived together for five years before a bitter breakup about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Worden claimed in court papers that Sizer threatened him, harassed him and once 
let the air out of his tires. Sizer responded in court that Worden had 
threatened her, abused her children and let the air out of her tires, too. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the judge issued a mutual restraining order, 
telling Sizer and Worden to stay away from each other. Sizer also was told to 
stay away from the Boyer family. 
</P>
<P>
Sizer said the judge also indicated from the bench that the order applies to 
Boyer and his family. Boyer insists that it does not apply to him. 
</P>
<P>
Sizer said Boyer hurt his credibility by airing dirty laundry and denied that 
she was waging a personal war on the councilman. The real issue, she said, is 
Boyer's pro-growth voting record. Revealing the court order was a weak attempt 
to win sympathy from the public, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are grasping at straws," Sizer said. "They are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said he disclosed the court order to show the public that personal 
animosity was, in part, behind the recall. "It's the overriding motive for at 
least one person, who claims she's the spokesman for the group," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
But the blend of politics and personal lives in Santa Clarita is even more 
complex. Leon Worden is the son of Connie Worden, an influential figure in 
Santa Clarita who resigned from the city Planning Commission last month after 
critics revealed she had falsely claimed on her resume that she had earned a 
master's degree in history. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Worden said she resigned mainly to devote more time to her brokerage 
firm and apologized for the misstatement on her resume. 
</P>
<P>
A letter sent to the city attorney challenging Worden's resume was written by 
Brad Ambler, a member of OUST. 
</P>
<P>
Ambler said he acted as a private citizen, not on behalf of OUST, but some City 
Hall watchers say the fall of Worden and the attack on Boyer are part of a 
general dissatisfaction with the inner circle of civic leaders who led the 
fight for incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
John O'Dwyer, another OUST member, said the group targeted Boyer because of his 
overall record on development. The focal point of the recall, however, was 
Boyer's vote last month on the controversial Santa Catarina condominium 
project, which was killed by the council in response to an avalanche of 
homeowner opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer was the lone council member to vote against killing the project. Boyer 
said he hoped the developer could be compelled to make badly needed road 
improvements in exchange for city approval of the project. Boyer said he knew 
the vote was unpopular but cast it "so I could look myself in the mirror in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
That vote has touched off debates on the proper role of an elected 
representative in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of the councilman is clear," Ambler said. "He is there to represent 
the will of the people, not to go off on his own agenda and do what he wants to 
do. And that's what Carl Boyer did." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said there are times when an official 
must let his heart -- and the facts -- guide him. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you take a poll before each time you vote?" he asked. "Or do you vote your 
conscience? I just don't want to see government by intimidation, threatening 
recall every time you don't agree with someone." 
</P>
<P>
Sizer said widespread discontent will make the recall of Boyer succeed. But 
Boyer is well-known in Santa Clarita and was reelected to a four-year term in 
April with 4,042 votes, just 39 votes behind top vote-getter Jill Klajic, who 
ran on a controlled-growth platform. 
</P>
<P>
A high school social science teacher, he has served on the local water board 
and community college board of trustees, and projects the image of a scholar 
with a dry sense of humor. He is a genealogist and has compiled passenger lists 
of sailing ships into books to aid historians. The books are "about as 
interesting as phone books," but doing the research pleases him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents fear a recall battle will further split a city already divided 
by the Santa Catarina controversy. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said the recall movement has discouraged him and some of his friends, 
who thought Santa Clarita could avoid the squabbles which often erupt in young 
cities as they struggle to learn the basics of home rule. 
</P>
<P>
One of his friends recently told McKeon: "I thought we were better than this. I 
guess we're not." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Calvert, an unsuccessful candidate in the City Council election in April, 
said she does not want to see a recall election, although she personally 
dislikes Boyer and once got into a shouting match with him at a council meeting 
over the Santa Catarina project. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got enough wounds to heal in this community," she said.

RESIDENTS ARE UPSET BY REMOVAL OF TREES

<P>
On her way home recently from a trip to the fire-ravaged hills of Santa 
Barbara, Debra Ashley gave thanks that her own home, with its view of towering 
eucalyptus trees, would still be waiting for her. 
</P>
<P>
But when she returned, she found that all but a few of the 100-foot trees 
beyond her back-yard gate had been torn out and that the outlying field was 
filled with churning bulldozers, sending rumblings like those at the beginning 
of a medium-sized earthquake through her house. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we could go home and still have our trees, but when we got here, 
everything was gone. Our homes are literally shaking every day. My son hasn't 
taken a nap in a month," Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley and her neighbors on Briarwood Lane in the Village San Juan Capistrano 
housing tract claim they were never directly notified about the earthmoving 
project, part of a plan to build an extra parking lot for Capistrano Valley 
High School on a nearby slope. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a deal with the Capistrano Unified School District, the Mission 
Viejo Co. is grading a former RV storage lot below the high school and using 
the dirt to build a tiered parking lot against the slope descending from the 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Mission Viejo Co. overseeing the grading said that the 
eucalyptus grove had to be removed to grade the outer portions of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
"The trees were in the way, so we took them out, but we kept all the ones we 
could," said Wendy Wetzel. "They're not endangered. They'll grow back, and it's 
our property." 
</P>
<P>
But residents said they would have protested removal of the trees had they been 
informed of public meetings held in June. The hearings were advertised in a 
newspaper delivered only to Mission Viejo residents, and the only other 
notification given was a sign posted at the high school site nearly half a mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really sorry it happened this way, but they were legally notified," said 
Karl Krebs, director of facilities planning for Capistrano Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Under guidelines of the California Environmental Quality Act, the sign at the 
high school site was the only notification needed, Krebs said. 
</P>
<P>
But residents charged that school district officials should have notified the 
president of the Village San Juan Homeowners' Assn. about the project. Instead, 
Capistrano Valley High School Principal Thomas Anthony notified the high 
school's PTA president, Krebs said, because she happened to be a resident of 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Village residents and school district officials will meet Friday August 10 to 
iron out discuss their differences and landscaping suggestions for the high 
school parking lot, due to open this fall. CHERYLANNE BEALER

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER BURNED IN CRASH THROUGH FREEWAY FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old man was in extremely critical condition Sunday after he was 
pulled from a car that drifted off the Ventura Freeway, crashed through a fence 
and burst into flames, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An Bui suffered second- and third-degree burns over much of his lower body in 
the 5:15 a.m. crash in a North Hollywood neighborhood, Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Bui's passengers -- two women and a child -- were treated for minor injuries at 
AMI Medical Center of North Hollywood. Bui was being treated at County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the car drifted from the eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway, 
smashed through a chain-link fence separating the roadway from Sarah Street and 
stopped in front of 4554 Kraft Ave., where it burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the fire was quickly extinguished, but it took firefighters half an 
hour to pull Bui from the wreckage.

School officials are urging parents to enroll children early in school, because 
getting the necessary paper work and shots may take more time than they think. 
</P>
<P>
All children who will be 5 years old on or before Dec. 2 are eligible to attend 
kindergarten, but they must have birth certificates, baptismal certificates or 
passports. 
</P>

UNION SAYS ITS TALKS WITH CITY ARE AT IMPASSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The union that represents half of the municipal employees in San Fernando has 
declared an impasse after three months of contract talks with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Major disagreements remain between Local 690 of the California League of City 
Employees Assn. and the city of San Fernando over working conditions for five 
police dispatchers and salaries for all union members, union representative 
Dora Saenz said. 
</P>
<P>
The union represents about 60 of the city's 115 employees, including 
lower-level city service employees. The union does not represent the city's 30 
police officers or city management employees. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides began meeting in April to negotiate a new contract to succeed the 
three-year agreement that expired June 30, said James Hansen, mayor pro tem of 
San Fernando. Talks broke down July 31 after about six bargaining sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The union sent the city a letter July 31 declaring that it would not be able to 
settle its differences with the city's bargaining team, Saenz said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has called for a final meeting with the union this week, Hansen said. 
If the two sides agree then that their differences are irreconcilable, he said, 
the City Council will be asked to impose the city's final contract offer on the 
CLOCEA members for one year. He refused to disclose terms of that final offer. 
</P>
<P>
During that year the two sides would negotiate a longer contract, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Saenz said the union would attend the Aug. 20 council meeting to give the City 
Council its view of unsettled issues. Saenz said the union opposes the 
imposition of a one-year contract but declined to say what steps the union 
members might take if the council does impose it. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando declared an impasse last year in negotiations with its 30-member 
police union, and the City Council voted Aug. 23, 1989, to impose a one-year 
contract on the officers. The city and the police union signed a new three-year 
contract July 1, Hansen said.

MIKE PENNER: SAME RAM SCHEDULE: THEY PLAY TOURISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams can't get to the Super Bowl but they can get to East Berlin by 
climbing through a hole in the Berlin Wall. Five of them did it Sunday, proving 
once again that anything in this world is possible as long as Joe Montana 
doesn't play for the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, by the time the Rams got there, it was more Berlin mall than Berlin 
Wall. "I wish we would've gotten over here earlier," said offensive tackle Irv 
Pankey as he surveyed the swap meet that has set up shop outside Brandenburg 
Gate. Much has happened during the nine months after the liberation of Berlin 
-- most of it good if you own a piece of the rock and are looking to turn a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
Want a chunk of the wall? Five deutschemarks (about $3) will get you a plastic 
bag of graffiti-splattered stones, complete with certificate of authenticity. A 
palm-sized slab goes for two deutschemarks. And for three, you can rent a 
hammer and a chisel and take matters into your own hands. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviet guards who once patrolled the wall are now retired, their 
uniforms are up for sale. Spread atop folding tables as far as the eye can see 
are helmets, officers' caps, khaki shirts, medals, pins, coats and trousers -- 
an altogether different type of radical chic. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you're more interested in something suitable for framing, a vendor will 
gladly show you something black and white and once read all over the zonal 
border -- signs that scream, with a foreboding air: 
</P>
<P>
 Sperrgebeit! 
</P>
<P>
 HALT! 
</P>
<P>
 The irony behind this curtain is palpable. After 30 years, the Western world's 
darkest symbol of Communist repression has been trampled underfoot by 
capitalistic fervor, where, if you wish to share a piece of history, it's going 
to cost you. 
</P>
<P>
The death trap has become a tourist trap. Maybe you call it progress. 
</P>
<P>
Several Rams went along for the ride within hours of the team plane's landing 
at Tegel Airport. The Rams are here for an exhibition game with the Kansas City 
Chiefs, but more than that, they are seeking their place in the sun. London in 
1988. Tokyo in 1989. Berlin in 1990. Searching for some kind of identity, and 
knowing that America's Team has already been taken, Georgia Frontiere has the 
Rams committed to going global. 
</P>
<P>
As the Lewis and Clark of the NFL's world-conquest program -- Lawrence Taylor 
uber alles -- the Rams know the value of a photo opportunity. So Sunday 
afternoon, five players were rustled together and quickly shuttled off to the 
wall, with a couple of brief stops in front of the cameras along the way. 
</P>
<P>
First up, Kaiser Wilhelm Church, a landmark in the middle of the financial 
district in West Berlin. This church, shelled during World War II, stands today 
as it did 45 years ago in memory of the bloodshed. The players posed in front 
of it and next to Berlin, a twisting metallic abstract sculpture that is 
supposed to symbolize the relationship between East and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Art critic Pankey's analysis? 
</P>
<P>
"Some silver stuff in the middle of the street." 
</P>
<P>
Next, the bus weaved its way to Brandenburg Gate and a glimpse at the last few 
remnants of the wall. You can buy more than you can see and the hawkers hit 
everyone in the Rams' party, some more than others. 
</P>
<P>
Pankey decided he had to have a Russian hat, fur-lined and fur-covered, ideal 
for days such as Sunday -- pushing 90 degrees and panting amid the humidity. 
</P>
<P>
"Amigo!" Pankey shouted at an astonished salesman. "How much for one of those?" 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five marks, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Pankey pulled off the white baseball cap he was wearing, complete with sharp 
NFL logo. "I'll trade you this for that," Pankey proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor shook his head. "Is worth one mark," he replied, frowning at 
Pankey's headgear. 
</P>
<P>
So Pankey shelled out the 35 marks and grinned beneath the black fur for the 
photographers until he walked a few yards and saw the same hats selling at 
another booth for 15 marks. 
</P>
<P>
Silly American. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached the wall, Pankey was determined to get his money's 
worth. He rented one of the hammer-and-chisel kits and went off to stalk the 
cement. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to get a good spot," he said. "I'm going to be upset if I don't get a good 
piece of this wall." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey got more than one. He wanted his twin infant sons, Keith and Kevin, to 
have something besides pine cones and lizards by the time they reach 
show-and-tell age. Then he passed the hammer to his teammates. Fullback Robert 
Delpino took a few whacks. Kicker Mike Lansford and guard Duval Love pounded 
away as well. 
</P>
<P>
The graffiti is striking and it is telling. There are many references to Pink 
Floyd, the rock group whose concept album, "The Wall," was the inspiration for 
last month's German Woodstock, which brought a crowd of 300,000 to the real 
wall for a live performance of the music. There are lyrics from the Sex 
Pistols' "Holiday In the Sun": "Now there's a reason to be waiting at the 
Berlin Wall." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was built, Berliners had been waiting for this wall to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are holes in the cement big enough to drive a lineman through. 
Pankey completed the journey, stepping from west to east, and someone asked him 
if the wall takes on a new meaning when viewed from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall's down," Pankey answered. "That's the best meaning." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the Rams were summoned back to the bus and headed back to 
the team hotel, where beds and treatment for severe jet-lag awaited. Pankey 
looked beat, and he'd been taken at least once, but he figured there are worse 
PR gigs than this. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a kick in the butt," Pankey said with a grin. "I think I scared the 
hell out of some of the people there. A lot of people just turned around and 
looked at me and kept looking up. They had to catch themselves. It was a new 
experience, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-5, 280-pound professional football player in Germany. A newly 
dismantled Berlin Wall. The sightings are for real, even if they do take some 
time to sink in.

<P>
BASEBALL: CHUCK FINLEY RECOVERS AFTER GIVING UP LEADOFF HOMER TO RICKEY 
HENDERSON, BUT OAKLAND COMES ALIVE IN THE EIGHTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It evolved into a contest of wills, a tense matchup between a pitcher who is 
sure he will win 20 games for a fourth consecutive season and one who hopes he 
will win 20 for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
For seven innings Sunday, Oakland's Dave Stewart gave Chuck Finley and the 
Angels no room to waver, and Finley was no more generous to Stewart and the 
A's. Given so little, the A's still took away from Anaheim Stadium a 4-1 
victory, emphasizing in a dozen different ways the distinctions between 
champions and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching four days after an 11-inning shutout victory over Seattle, Stewart 
sustained a brilliant stretch Sunday by giving the Angels only one unearned run 
in the sixth on an error and Devon White's triple. 
</P>
<P>
Finley was nearly as good, recovering after he yielded a home run to Rickey 
Henderson leading off the game. But he faltered under the pressure applied in 
the eighth by Henderson and the A's. 
</P>
<P>
By giving up only five hits over seven innings, Stewart (15-8) moved a step 
closer to becoming the first pitcher to record four consecutive 20-win seasons 
since Hall of Famer Jim Palmer did so in 1975-78. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets in a game like this one -- and he's had about four or five all 
year -- where you can't blink, you can't flinch or you lose, he's awesome," A's 
Manager Tony La Russa said. "That's two games back to back and you tell me how 
he can do that on three days' rest, twice, first against (Erik) Hanson and now 
against Finley where you just can't flinch." 
</P>
<P>
Finley flinched in the eighth, walking Henderson on a full count. The game's 
third-leading base stealer stole his 920th base and scored on Dave Henderson's 
two-out single, but the A's didn't stop there. Terry Steinbach doubled and Mark 
McGwire deflated the spirits of the 51,597 fans with a two-run single, giving 
the A's a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent our best pitcher out there, they sent their best pitcher out. You knew 
we were going to have a battle today," said Henderson, who extended his own 
record with his 44th home run leading off a game. "We scored off him early and 
Stew shut them down real well. It was tough because Finley's a real tough 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Tough as he is, Finley was not prepared for another loss Sunday. Informed after 
the game that his 8-month old nephew had died of a heart problem in a New 
Orleans hospital, Finley was distraught and did not speak with reporters. He 
will fly today to his hometown of Monroe, La., for the funeral of James Cory 
Cox, the son of his sister, Susan Cox, and her husband, Rodney. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched great. He pitched well enough to win," Angel Manager Doug Rader 
said of Finley. "It was an excellent ballgame. You've got to admire both 
performances. They got a two-out base hit to break it open and that was the 
ballgame. It was a very good ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
And a very satisfying game for Stewart, who moved ahead of Finley and is tied 
with Boston's Roger Clemens for the second-highest victory total in the AL. 
Stewart lowered his earned-run average to 2.58, behind Clemens' 2.14 and 
Finley's 2.40. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I threw the ball pretty well and got outs when I needed them," said 
Stewart, who has won four consecutive games and has given up one earned run 
over 27 innings. "I just wanted to give us a chance to win the ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Nerve-wracking is what it is against a pitcher like Finley. You know Finley is 
going to be in the ballgame from the first out till the last. You hope you 
don't make the first mistake. Fortunately, he made a mistake to Rickey 
Henderson in the first inning. Devon White had an RBI for them in the sixth and 
that was another mistake, but Finley's a great competitor, probably one of the 
best in the league." 
</P>
<P>
But the A's are a team of superb competitors. Henderson excelled at the plate, 
on the basepaths and in left field, crashing into the barrier in the second 
inning to catch a fly ball hit by Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get a better example. That's probably as good as you'll ever see," 
La Russa said. "He hits a home run, makes a run where nobody else could make it 
-- and you don't steal many bases off Finley -- and he plays a nice left field, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, whose league-leading batting average fell a point to .332, said his 
leadoff home run on a 3-and-2 fastball was a nice boost for the A's. "We knew 
there weren't going to be many runs scored," he said. "The name of the game was 
who was going to score first." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, with relief help from Rick Honeycutt and Dennis Eckersley, made sure 
the Angels didn't score most. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to be consistent and give our ballclub what it needed," he 
said. "I've been pitching well but the results just haven't been real good. 
Things are starting to go more in my favor. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty wins never creeps into my mind because I know I'm going to do it. I 
know it. I've done it the past three years and nobody else has. No question, 
I'm going to do that. It's something I expect to do. Basically, it's not a 
matter of if I do it, but when I do it." 
</P>
<P>
The A's have taken eight of 10 games from the Angels this season and are still 
2 1/2 games ahead of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're perfect, but I don't think there's an area where anyone 
can say, 'We can beat that club there,' " La Russa said. "We can improve, but I 
think we're playing pretty well. There's always a way to play better with what 
you've got." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's attendance of 51,597 gave the Angels a record for attendance at a 
four-game series at Anaheim Stadium, with a total of 188,616. The previous 
four-game series record was 173,347, set July 1-4, 1983 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Joe Grahe, who had a chance to win his major league debut Saturday 
against Oakland, didn't mind not getting a decision as long as the Angels won. 
He showed considerable poise after Rickey Henderson walked, stole second, went 
to third on an error and scored the first run before the game was more than a 
few minutes old. "I thought it went OK. I was able to keep us in the game and 
it was a big game for the Angels," said Grahe, who gave up three earned runs in 
5 1/3 innings. "It was kind of a relaxer when Henderson scored. It was, 'OK, 
they got their first run,' that way I didn't have to be anxious about when 
they'd score." 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, on the disabled list with a strained lower back, will be 
re-evaluated Tuesday. He was been hitting from both sides of the plate as well 
as throwing and running and has reported no pain. Wally Joyner (broken right 
kneecap) is progressing slowly. Mark McLemore (sprained right wrist) has been 
hitting, taking grounders and throwing without difficulty. Greg Minton (sore 
left arm) has been throwing lightly. He hopes he has found a cure for his arm 
woes: shaving his mustache. "Maybe if I'm incognito from my elbow it will hurt 
less," he said.

RAMS GRAB THEIR BITS AND PIECES OF ROCK

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, a football team with an owner who has an insatiable quest for 
international adventure, arrived here Sunday morning to begin preparations for 
their third overseas exhibition game in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Georgia Frontiere did not accompany her team on its charter flight, but 
she is expected to arrive from New York in plenty of time to celebrate the 
events leading to Saturday's game with the Kansas City Chiefs at Olympic 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas previous trips to London in 1987 and Tokyo last year lacked for 
substance beyond promotional considerations, the Rams have arrived in Berlin 
amid quite an international backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
The team hotels stand not far beyond the shadows of the Brandenburg Gate, which 
separated West from East Berlin until last Nov. 9, when The Wall came tumbling 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, every trip abroad has its inconveniences. Last year in Tokyo, some 
Rams complained privately about having to double up in rooms while their 
opponent and chief rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, enjoyed separate 
accommodations in the same hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Rams arrived in a city sweltering from an unusual summer heat wave. 
Temperatures are in the 90s. One of the two hotels housing the players is 
without air conditioning, and the single beds in some rooms appear no more than 
cloth draped over a balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
The worn look on the sweaty face of nose tackle Alvin Wright, 6-foot-2 and 285 
pounds, summed up the situation appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players who had hit the wall, so to speak, somewhere over the 
Atlantic Ocean, were in no condition to chip away at the rapidly-disappearing 
barrier that had divided Berlin since the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Five bleary-eyed Rams, though, put aside sleep and took a quick tour of the 
site of one of the most celebrated and symbolic episodes in recent history: the 
destruction of a wall that started the process toward the reunification of 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Irv Pankey, guard Duval Love, linebacker Larry Kelm, kicker Mike 
Lansford and fullback Robert Delpino were eager to help dismantle where they 
could. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall that once adjoined the Brandenburg Gate has crumbled and become 
thousands of souvenirs. Really, there is scarce visible evidence that it ever 
existed, though pieces can be purchased -- complete with certificates of 
authenticity -- for five German deutschemarks (about $3 U.S. currency) from one 
of several hundred merchants that now compose a human wall of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with just purchasing history, the players were driven past 
Potsdamer Platz, site of last week's historic rock concert, to a section of 
secondary wall that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Pankey, 6-foot-5 and 280 pounds, rented a chisel and hammer and began chipping 
away. He broke off two particular pieces, one for each of his 14 month old twin 
sons, Keith and Kevin. One day, Pankey said, he'll explain to his sons the 
meaning of two ordinary-looking pieces of concrete and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"In school, when they're studying history, they can stand up in class and they 
can say, 'I got a piece of that wall,' " Pankey said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelm said it was difficult for him to understand the enormity of recent events 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very interesting," he said. "But it's hard for me to realize exactly the 
situation. I was never here before, when there was all the tension. I probably 
take it for granted, like it's always been like this." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram players who didn't make the trip were unsigned veteran linebacker Kevin 
Greene, safety Michael Stewart, defensive end Doug Reed, and tight end Damone 
Johnson. Tackle Jackie Slater is signed but has not reported. Receiver Aaron 
Cox stayed home to nurse a hamstring injury that is expected to keep him out 
three to six weeks. . . . The Kansas City Chiefs, who also arrived Sunday 
morning, were greeted at the hotel by a Prussian Brass Band in full historical 
regalia. The Chiefs arrived without seven unsigned veterans of their own, one 
signed player who has not reported -- corner Albert Lewis -- and an unsigned 
first-round draft choice, linebacker Percy Snow. Kansas City practiced for 
about an hour after arriving. The Rams and Chiefs will scrimmage Tuesday, 
Wednesday and Thursday. . . . The same plane that dropped off the Rams in West 
Berlin is taking the Raiders back to Los Angeles from London. . . . The Rams 
are not flying back to Los Angeles right after Saturday's game, as originally 
planned. The team will leave Sunday and arrive the same day in Los Angeles at 
1:40 p.m. . . . Hard to believe, but Rams' defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur 
is not German. He is of Polish, Irish and English descent.

TRAINING WHEELS OFF AS RACE ACROSS AMERICA GETS UNDER WAY; 
</P>
<P>
CYCLING: SAN JOSE'S PAT WARD TAKES LEAD ALMOST FROM START AND IS 41 MINUTES 
AHEAD OF NEXT RIDER AFTER FIRST 200 MILES.

<P>
A few minutes past 8 a.m. Sunday, Kay Ryschon walked out of the Holiday Inn 
lobby and into a cool, overcast morning. 
</P>
<P>
A few friends and family members, her lifeline for the next eight to 11 days of 
the Race Across America, broke into applause as she strode across the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
"You look like a million bucks," someone said, offering Ryschon a hug. 
</P>
<P>
A few paces away, Victor Gallo stood in front of his support van signing an 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys are something else," the autograph seeker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks, see you at the finish line," Gallo said. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:15, Jim Penseyres of San Juan Capistrano and his crew pulled into the 
Irvine parking lot. Penseyres, riding shotgun, slapped hands with a friend as 
they drove past. 
</P>
<P>
Standing near her pace van, which was filled to overflowing with water bottles, 
T-shirts and bicycle paraphernalia for the trip, a friend rubbed sunscreen on 
Michelle Grainger's arms, shoulders and face. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes before the 9 a.m. start, John Marino, the race founder and 
director, began introducing the 45 cyclists, who, if all goes well, will cover 
2,922 miles in 10 states from Irvine to Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bond, a 6-foot-8 design engineer from Dayton, Ohio, stood out among the 
crowd, earning the most applause. 
</P>
<P>
Photographers and friends, sometimes one and the same, milled about the riders, 
trying to get a few snapshots and soothe their nerves at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The tension was palpable. 
</P>
<P>
Ryschon, in green, black and pink spandex, fidgeted. A 32-year-old 
biostatistician from Omaha, Neb., Ryschon is attempting her first RAAM. 
</P>
<P>
At 58, Gallo is the oldest rider in the field. But he is considered a threat to 
win. Recently, he set a record for a ride from his home in Miami to Portland, 
Me. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty exciting," said Gallo, who is also riding in his first RAAM. "I'm 
relaxed right now. By the time I get to the staging area, it'll be a different 
story." 
</P>
<P>
A few seconds past 9, Penseyres, a 43-year-old machinist at the San Onofre 
Nuclear Power Plant, and Rob Kish, a 35-year-old land surveyor from Port 
Orange, Fla., and the elder statesmen in this year's field, rode out of the 
parking lot and turned left onto Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Penseyres and Kish, who were 13th and sixth, respectively, in the 1985 RAAM, 
led a group of 30 escort riders who accompanied the RAAM riders as far as Yorba 
Linda Park. 
</P>
<P>
The start continued that way -- two RAAM riders, desperately trying to hold 
back pent-up energy, trailed by inexperienced riders trying to get their feet 
safely into the toe-clips without causing a crash. 
</P>
<P>
By 9:20, the riders had started, headed toward the Santa Ana River trail. They 
rode in congenial packs to Yorba Linda Park. Once there, the RAAM riders 
reassembled, bid a final "See you at the finish line" to family and friends and 
began the long trek toward Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30, the last of the support vans had left the Irvine parking area and the 
sun began burning off the coastal fog. 
</P>
<P>
The cool morning rapidly turned into a hot, windy afternoon as the riders 
continued east toward Palm Springs. Pat Ward of San Jose took the lead almost 
from the start and was 41 minutes ahead of Rick Kent of Houston and Bob Fourney 
of Denver at 9 p.m. after the first 200 miles Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Stern of Menlo Park led the women's division. She was about 165 miles 
into the race and in eighth place overall at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The riders encountered an atypical head wind in the Palm Springs area. The 
temperature was a few degrees above 100 as most of the riders moved through the 
desert city between 3:45 and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun faded a bit and the temperature dipped below 100, the riders met 
their first difficult climb. In about 30 miles, they went from 14 feet below 
sea level to 1,800 feet above at Chiriaco Summit. Ward passed the rest stop 
near the top of the summit at 6:10 p.m. and second-place rider Kent didn't pass 
until 40 minutes later. Ward hit the second time station in Desert Center at 
7:42 p.m. Ward's crew said he felt fine and didn't mind the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"That's (the heat) what he likes to train in," one crew member said. 
</P>
<P>
Penseyres had yet to pass the second time station as of 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Over the summit, the riders were greeted by a full moon and storm clouds that 
brought lightning. Combined with a sandstorm on the horizon, it promised a 
difficult night's ride.

MISREPRESENTATION: POSTCARDS INVITE ARTISTS TO SHOW THEIR WORK AT A NONEXISTENT 
FACILITY FOR A $12 FEE. IS IT FRAUD, OR MAYBE A BIZARRE BIT OF PERFORMANCE ART?

<P>
Seduction comes easy these days. Elaborate mailings assure us that we are among 
the select few invited to subscribe to an upscale magazine, or to use a charge 
card named after a precious metal. For a fleeting moment we may even believe 
that we are being singled out as special. It's only human to preen. 
</P>
<P>
Artists are hardly immune. The tiniest sign that someone really is interested 
in their work is enough to send many a fledgling artist into orbit. After all, 
toting slides to indifferent art gallery owners can induce depression in the 
hardiest soul. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine how you'd feel if you were an artist who got a tantalizing postcard 
inviting you to show your work at a museum -- with just a few strings attached. 
On March 31, someone mailed a batch of such postcards from a Los Angeles ZIP 
code to an untold number of artists in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County Museum of Contemporary Art INVITES You to submit a Bio and 
Slides (All Media) of your Art Work," read the post card, printed in a mixture 
of script and sans-serif type. "The OCMCA is a (sic) Exciting and New 
Contemporary Art Museum accompanied by a Sales and Rental Gallery. Please 
submit your Materials and Twelve Dollars to: OCMCA, Registry Dept. P.O. Box 
691951, Los Angeles, CA 90069." 
</P>
<P>
The postcard is confusing. Are artists to be considered for curated museum 
exhibitions or for the distinctly less thrilling prospect of showing in a sales 
and rental gallery? Syntax aside, however, a bigger problem looms: 
</P>
<P>
There apparently is no such entity as the Orange County Museum of Contemporary 
Art. The California secretary of state's office reports that OCMCA has never 
registered as either a nonprofit or for-profit organization, as required by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Was someone out to defraud local artists? Was the solicitation someone's idea 
of a joke -- or even a peculiar "performance" piece? 
</P>
<P>
Deciding to play amateur sleuth after a Los Angeles artist mailed me the 
postcard she received, I located several other L.A. and Orange County artists 
who received the solicitations. One lives as far away as the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of too many museums that function like this," said Michael Hughes 
of Los Angeles, who received a postcard. "It didn't sound right. . . . And why 
was the post office box in Los Angeles if the museum was in Orange County?" 
</P>
<P>
The "cheap" look of the postcard also aroused Hughes' suspicions, but "it was 
the $12 more than anything else," he said, that made him question the offer. 
Normally, no money changes hands when a museum asks an artist to exhibit work. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Feld, an artist who lives in Santa Monica, admitted that the words invite 
you initially hooked her. "Oh, I don't have to go out and solicit," she 
thought. The $12 charge didn't strike her as peculiar, she said, because rental 
gallery slide registries commonly require artists to pay a small fee per slide. 
</P>
<P>
Feld's husband was skeptical, however, and suggested she call the museum to 
check it out. When she discovered that Orange County directory information has 
no listing for OCMCA, her bright hopes were dashed. 
</P>
<P>
The Better Business Bureau that serves the Los Angeles-Orange County area has 
recorded no complaints against any Orange County Museum of Contemporary Art. 
U.S. Postal Inspector Donald Obritsch said his office hadn't received any 
complaints about the museum solicitation either, but after receiving a copy of 
the postcard, he agreed that it might fall under the category of bunco crimes, 
or swindles. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, I learned that the post office box to which artists were supposed 
to send the slides and money was opened on March 26 by one Scott C. Griesbach 
in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Voter registration records show that 
Griesbach was born in 1967 in Wisconsin and is a Republican. Directory 
information had no phone number for him. A letter I mailed to his home address, 
asking that he call me to discuss the matter, has gone unanswered. So far, I've 
been unable to get ahold of him. 
</P>
<P>
When Griesbach filled out the post box rental form, he didn't say he'd be 
operating a business out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
It was heartening to hear from Obritsch that the post office has processed only 
"a negligible amount" of mail for the box number. 
</P>
<P>
Several artists I spoke to said they sent letters asking for more information, 
which they never received. One artist said he mailed a $12 check on April 20 
and got nothing in return except his cancelled check, which was endorsed 
"OCMCA" and apparently had been deposited. 
</P>
<P>
The stamp on the back of the check indicates that it cleared through the 
downtown Los Angeles branch of Security Pacific Bank on June 12, but a bank 
representative said the numbers underneath the endorsement don't indicate that 
OCMCA has an account there. Bank personnel are looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
To open the account, the mastermind behind OCMCA would have to have produced 
documents showing that he owned or was associated with a genuine organization. 
The plot thickens. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Obritsch said his office would need "quite a few" complaints in order to open a 
formal investigation. And, in his experience, when the amount of money involved 
in each solicitation is less than $50, people generally figure it isn't worth 
their time to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, perhaps most of the artists who received the postcards were too 
savvy to send any money. But anyone who did risk the $12 and wishes to squawk 
to the proper authorities should write to the Postal Service's Regional Chief 
Inspector, Western Region, 850 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, Calif. 94098-0100.

ANGELES BRUSH FIRE CONTAINED

<P>
A brush fire believed ignited by a lightning bolt continued burning this 
morning in Angeles National Forest west of Lancaster but the blaze was not 
endangering any homes, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which was started about 6 p.m. Sunday during an electrical storm, had 
burned 125 acres of brush near 200 Street West and Lancaster Road, county fire 
dispatcher Ronald Coffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Coffin said county and U.S. Forestry Service firefighters have the slow-moving 
blaze 90% contained but are making no estimate on how long it will take to 
control it. A helicopter and a crew of more than 50 were fighting the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Coffin said about a dozen other fires started by lightning strikes in the Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys were quickly put out Sunday night after burning 
only a few acres total.

HUNDREDS ROUNDED UP DURING SWEEP OF KUWAIT HOTELS;

<P>
Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign 
nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N. Security Council overwhelming approved 
sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading 
the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of 
Westerners based in Kuwait or caught by the invasion. More than 1 million 
foreigners live and work in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans were grabbed in the hotels, 
and some were taken to Iraq, the West German and British foreign ministries 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain said Baghdad had given no reason for detaining 366 people, most of them 
passengers from a British Airways flight stranded at Kuwait airport by the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, which included a ban on oil purchases, came on a vote of 13 
to 0, on the 15-member council. Cuba and Yemen abstained on the resolution, 
which was proposed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that 
they should not forget their citizens in Kuwait while heaping on economic 
punishments, and today's roundup appeared to be a reaction against the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops rolled into its New Jersey-sized neighbor Thursday, conquering the 
capital and moving south toward the Saudi Arabian border. 
</P>
<P>
Persian Gulf oil sources said today that they had seen Saudi troops moving 
north toward the Kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of Khafji, but the Saudis 
denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities today told Turkey's state-run pipeline company that one of 
the twin pipelines that carry Baghdad's oil through Turkey will be closed "for 
reasons of marketing," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
World oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as 
more countries joined the attempt to strangle Baghdad's economy and force it to 
withdraw its invasion troops. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil revenues totaled more than $11 billion last year. It has been 
pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the 1980-88 war 
with Iran and settle foreign debts of up to $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Iraq gave for invading Kuwait was Kuwaiti reluctance to slow 
its flow of oil and push oil prices higher, but it was Iraqi oil that had 
slowed today. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few tankers loading Iraqi oil at Yumurtalik," a senior Turkish 
government official said, referring to the export jetties on the Turkish side 
of the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein ordered drills for millions of people in 
case mass evacuations were needed. 
</P>
<P>
He warned his nation's 17 million people to be on alert for possible U.S. or 
Israeli attacks. The United States has warned Iraq against any attack on Saudi 
Arabia, and President Bush has said all options are open for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Kuwaitis took to the desert to flee into Saudi Arabia, their 
children and a few belongings crammed into four-wheel-drive vehicles.

City Controller Rick Tuttle today named USC journalism professor and Pulitzer 
Prize-winner Edwin Guthman as his appointee to the voter-approved city Ethics 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Guthman, 70, who also worked for the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
will serve as Tuttle's representative on the five-member commission, which was 
part of a package of political reforms approved by voters in June, inspired by 
a series of scandals that rocked City Hall over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Four other appointments are still pending, two by Mayor Tom Bradley and one 
each by City Atty. James Hahn and Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
Guthman is a former editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer and former national 
editor of the Los Angeles Times.

Liberian rebels today seized 14 to 15 foreigners, including one American, from 
a hotel in downtown Monrovia, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the hostages were taken to a camp outside 
the capital city by forces loyal to Prince Johnson, who heads one of two 
factions fighting the government of President Samuel K. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that any of the hostages had been harmed. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages were taken from the African Hotel in Monrovia and moved to 
Johnson's headquarters in the town of Caldwell, Tutwiler said, adding that she 
had no information on the nationalities of the non-American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had threatened Saturday to arrest all foreigners in Monrovia in the 
hope of provoking international intervention in the nation's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 more people were evacuated from Monrovia today, including six U.S. 
government employees, Tutwiler said. The rest were foreign nationals living in 
Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marines operating from naval vessels off shore evacuated 74 people over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Marines are dug in at the U.S. Embassy to defend the 
"skeleton-size" diplomatic staff remaining there and to ferry those people who 
want to escape the West African nation's civil strife, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 62 U.S. citizens evacuated in the weekend helicopter rescue mission that 
began Sunday, 35 have been flown to neighboring Sierra Leone and "on to London 
where travel arrangements are being made" for them to return to the United 
States, the Pentagon said in a statement today.

MEDFLY IS DISCOVERED IN BREA; 
</P>
<P>
INFESTATION: THE FLY IS THE FIRST ONE DISCOVERED IN ORANGE COUNTY SINCE JAN. 
10. A DECISION ON AERIAL MALATHION SPRAYING IS PENDING.

<P>
A Mediterranean fruit fly has been trapped in Brea, but state agricultural 
officials said today that they have not yet decided if aerial spraying of 
malathion will be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
The fly, found in a trap Friday and confirmed as a Medfly on Saturday, is the 
first one discovered in Orange County since Jan. 10, said Rick Lefeuvre, a 
deputy agricultural commissioner in the county. 
</P>
<P>
State agricultural officials have begun ground-spraying of malathion in 48 
residential yards near the tree where the fly was detected. They have also 
taken fruit samples from the area to check for larvae. 
</P>
<P>
The immature, unmated female fly was trapped in a peach tree less than a mile 
northeast of Puente Lane and Central Avenue. That location is only a quarter of 
a mile from where a pregnant Medfly was found in Brea last November, triggering 
Orange County's first round of spraying earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
That section of Brea is still under quarantine, which means back yard fruit 
cannot leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
In all, four have been found in the county and more than 260 in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying of malathion hasn't been conducted in Orange County for two 
months. The last time malathion was sprayed in Brea was April 30. In all, that 
area has been sprayed nine times. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly is considered a serious threat to agriculture because it can destroy 
more than 200 varieties of fruits and vegetables.

Jewish-born Morris Cerullo, the San Diego evangelist whose bid to buy PTL has 
won court approval, pledged today to keep Jim Bakker's Christian retreat free 
of demon rum and said it is time to forgive the imprisoned evangelist. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no drinking and there will be no smoking," Morris Cerullo, 58, 
told reporters at his first news conference since his $52-million bid for PTL 
was endorsed last week by a federal bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
But he said neither Bakker nor his wife, Tammy Faye, will be offered roles in 
the new ministry, although they are welcome to visit whenever they like. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Faye visited in March, but Bakker is not likely to visit any time soon -- 
he's serving a 45-year term for his conviction last year on charges of fleecing 
his flock at PTL.

The Food and Drug Administration today approved a drug, Exosurf Neonatal, that 
could help save thousands of premature infants born with immature lungs. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, a powder mixed with sterile water, substitutes for a naturally 
occurring foam that coats the inside of the lungs and keeps them from 
collapsing when the infant exhales. 
</P>
<P>
The infants receive the drug through a tube into their windpipes. They must be 
on a mechanical ventilator to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 infants are born prematurely each year in the United States. 
One-fifth of them have respiratory distress syndrome, or breathing 
difficulties, resulting from immature lungs. The problem is fatal in about 
5,000 cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
That makes respiratory distress syndrome the leading cause of death and 
disability among premature infants, the FDA said.

LATINO INCOME GAP WIDENED IN '80S; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: A NEW REPORT SAYS THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN AMERICA'S RICH AND 
POOR HAS INTENSIFIED EARNINGS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LATINOS AND OTHERS.

<P>
The difference between the incomes of Latinos and non-Latinos grew in the 
1980s, intensified by the wider gap between wealthy and other Americans, a 
report issued today said. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos have traditionally earned less than non-Latinos. But the study by the 
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the gap swelled during the last 
decade principally because Latino income stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos are nearly three times as likely to be among the poorest fifth of 
American households than among the wealthiest fifth, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings follow recent reports that Latinos are the most undereducated 
segment of the U.S. population and the fastest growing. They are expected to be 
the largest minority community within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The report's findings also came two weeks after the center reported a 
post-World War II high in the earnings gap between wealthy and other Americans. 
The top 20% of households will receive as much after-tax income this year as 
the other 80% combined, the center said last month. 
</P>
<P>
"When the gaps between rich and poor grow, Latinos tend to suffer the same 
fates as poor and moderate-income Americans," said Scott Barancik, author of 
the new report. 
</P>
<P>
Both reports use 1979-88 data, the latest available, from the U.S. Census 
Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office. The income figures are adjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The new study found that 28% of Latinos had incomes placing them in the poorest 
fifth of households in 1987. About 11% of Latino households had incomes that 
put them in the wealthiest fifth that year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the income of the typical Latino family was 71% of the average 
non-Latino family. That figure was 66% by 1988, the latest year to draw a 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants tend to have a lower income when they first arrive in the country, 
Barancik said. But he noted that there is also a substantial gap between the 
average incomes of Latinos born in the United States and non-Latinos.

Comic book character Dick Tracy found life on movie screens this summer, but a 
real Dick Tracy has been fighting crime in Manchester for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Richard (Dick) Tracy said he's taken a little more ribbing than 
usual about his name this summer. But he said things are still better than when 
his partner was Lt. Jimmy Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd knock on a door and they'd say 'Who's there?' We'd say 'Jimmy Stewart and 
Dick Tracy,' and they'd tell us to get lost," said Tracy, who works in the 
juvenile division. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, a man he questioned called a police commissioner to complain 
about a "wise guy who told me his name was Dick Tracy."

PUSH FOR IMMEDIATE UNION OF GERMANYS GAINS STEAM

Unions and political parties today demanded a vote on German unity as early as 
this week and said East Germany's worried people and dying economy can only be 
helped by quickly dissolving the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats, the second-biggest party in both German states, said they 
may seek to have East Germany's Parliament vote Wednesday to unite with West 
Germany this month. 
</P>
<P>
The small East German archconservative party, the German Social Union, said it 
will also propose Wednesday that the German states be unified. 
</P>
<P>
But the Christian Democrats of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East 
Germany Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said unity must wait for united 
German elections that they propose should be held Oct. 14 -- still, nearly two 
months earlier than had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict threatened to break up De Maiziere's broad coalition government 
and further fuel the political, economic and social upheaval in the young 
democratic nation. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the debate is an intense political struggle by parties 
jockeying to use unification to their political advantage in united German 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Horst Ehmke, deputy chairman of the West German Social Democrats, said West 
Germany can best deal with the shambles of East Germany's economy by 
immediately absorbing the former Communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic, social and financial developments in (East Germany) are going 
downhill at such a speed that I would not be astonished if we had a very fast 
unity," he said on West German radio. 
</P>
<P>
The left-leaning Social Democrats in both nations planned to meet late today to 
decide whether to press this week for a vote on unification. 
</P>
<P>
If their plan is approved, German unity would take place at the end of August.

The bodies of two slain Jewish teen-agers missing since Saturday were found 
today near an Arab neighborhood, triggering revenge stonings of Palestinian 
vehicles by crowds of angry Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Lior Tubul, 17, and Ronen Karamani, 18, were found in a valley in 
northern Jerusalem between the Arab neighborhood of Beit Hanina and Ramot, 
where they lived. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys had been bound, gagged and stabbed in the back many times, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to believe it was for anything but nationalistic reasons," 
Police Commissioner Ya'acov Turner said. "There is no clear-cut evidence. But 
there are no obvious explanations why they would be murdered for any other 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
Police said that many Arabs had been detained for questioning, but that they 
had no suspects. Police put Beit Hanina under curfew and searched the area. 
</P>
<P>
Turner urged calm, but crowds of angry Israeli Jews quickly gathered on roads 
in southern Jerusalem and stoned Palestinian cars from the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank. Three Palestinians riding in a bus were slightly injured by rocks, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 15 cars were stoned and a van set on fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We turn to the public to stay cool and to let us do our work," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The killings, immediately denounced by Israelis as an act of terrorism, came 
nine days after a 17-year-old Jewish Canadian tourist was killed by a pipe bomb 
on a Tel Aviv beach. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of the two Jerusalem teen-agers was deplored by leaders across the 
political spectrum.

Stock prices worldwide plunged, and oil prices rose more than $3 a barrel today 
after Japan and the European Community joined other nations in halting imports 
of Iraqi oil to protest the invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's Nikkei stock market index tumbled 916.23 points, or 3.1%, to 28,599.53 
after shedding 729.42 points Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"With Japan so dependent on oil, the bond market is getting battered by the 
high prices, and stocks responded in kind today," said a broker at a major 
Japanese brokerage. "If I were an investor, I certainly wouldn't be buying 
stocks right now." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index shed 248.97 points, or 7.42%, to close at 
3,107.98. 
</P>
<P>
"I would describe it as panic selling -- selling for the sake of selling," said 
James Osborn of Baring Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices leaped more than $3 a barrel in Asia as oil companies 
scrambled to secure supplies. U.S. West Texas Intermediate climbed to $27.45 a 
barrel for October delivery from $24.38 in the New York futures market Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion was quoted at $379.35 an ounce in late Tokyo trading against New

In the Singapore stock market, the Straits Times industrial index dropped to 
the year's lowest level, losing 96.03 points, or 6.35%, to close at 1,415.02. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all sell, sell. No one was interested in buying," one broker said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Australian stock market, where oil stocks benefited from the crisis, 
finished sharply weaker. The All Ordinaries index ended off 41.4 points at 
1,548.3. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, share prices plummeted on London's Stock Exchange as worries over 
increasing oil prices gripped the market. 
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 64.4 
points, or 2.9%, to 2,220.2. The session low was 2,202.5. It peaked at 2,253.1.

HARD-PRESSED STATES RAISE TAXES BY $7.6 BILLION IN '90

<P>
States increased taxes by an estimated $7.6 billion during 1990 legislative 
sessions, pushed by higher costs for schools, prisons and health care, a study 
released today said. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual survey of state budgets, the National Conference of State 
Legislatures said it expected state finances to continue to deteriorate in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"State balances fell throughout fiscal 1990 and for most states -- including 
all the larger states -- are now dangerously low," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
"The national average balance fell from 4.5% of expenditures at the end of 
fiscal 1989 to 4% at the end of fiscal 1990 and is expected to fall to 2.3% by 
the end of fiscal 1991," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Those balances are considered indicators of state fiscal conditions, and many 
states try to maintain a balance of 5% of general fund spending. The balance is 
considered a cushion against emergencies for states required by law or 
constitution to have balanced budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The NCSL released its report at its annual meeting being held this week in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The report said many state fiscal conditions weakened during the last year. 
Northeast and New England states were the hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
Tax increases were passed in 23 states. Those tax increases are expected to 
increase revenue by $7.6 billion in fiscal 1991, an increase of 2.6% of state 
tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
The study said spending for Medicaid, education and corrections grew faster 
than general state revenue. Medicaid spending grew at a 25% annual rate, 
putting pressure on state budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three major types of taxes, 10 states increased personal income taxes, 
the report said. Ten raised corporate income taxes, and 17 raised sales and use 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest tax increases were in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, New York, 
Kentucky and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Other states raising taxes were Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Vermont, Delaware, Ohio, Kansas, Nebraska, Alabama, Louisiana, 
Tennessee, Virginia, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey's increase totaled $2.2 billion, or 21% of 1989 revenue, the report 
said. Massachusetts' increase was $1.16 billion, or 12.8%, and Florida's was 
$1.09 billion, or 8.7%, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
States listed as lowering taxes were Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, South Carolina, 
Utah and Hawaii. All of the decreases were small, the report said.

Firstar Corp. and Banks of Iowa Inc. said today they have agreed to merge in a 
stock swap valued at about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said it will be the first interstate merger agreement in Iowa 
since that state approved an interstate banking law earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for Firstar, which is an $8.5-billion bank holding company 
based in Milwaukee, to exchange 2.7 of its shares for each outstanding share of 
the common stock of Banks of Iowa, a $2.5-billion bank holding company based in 
Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the closing price of Firstar stock Friday on the New York Stock 
Exchange, Banks of Iowa shareholders will receive a Firstar stock with a value 
of about $75.60 per share or a total of $219.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa company will become Firstar Corp. of Iowa upon completion of the 
transaction, and the combined organization will have 52 banks and 174 offices 
in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Arizona, as well as a trust 
subsidiary in Florida.

The Judas Priest trial moves from a courtroom to a recording studio today to 
allow a judge to hear for himself whether the heavy metal band's music includes 
the subliminal messages that allegedly drove two young men to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada District Judge Jerry Whitehead will convene his court in a Reno studio 
to listen to recordings of the original 24 tracks that were mixed into the 
"Better by You, Better Than Me" on the album "Stained Class." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the British rock group and CBS Records Inc. say they will also 
present testimony from the album's sound engineer and producer that there were 
no phrases such as "do it" hidden in the song. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives contend that subliminal messages in the music drove Raymond Belknap, 
18, and James Vance, 20, to their deaths in a 1985 suicide pact. 
</P>
<P>
Final arguments in the case are expected Wednesday or Thursday. Whitehead has 
indicated he will render a quick decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth McKenna, a lawyer for the Belknap family, said that he thinks there has 
been adequate evidence that the phrase is concealed in the music and that it 
prompted the young men to shoot themselves with a shotgun after drinking beer, 
smoking marijuana and listening to Judas Priest records for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Judas Priest and CBS Records deny there is anything hidden in the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has become a battle of contradictory testimony from sound and 
computer engineers, psychiatrists and psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the families have not indicated how much in damages they will seek. 
Vance lived for three years after the suicide attempt, but his face was badly 
disfigured and hospital bills amounted to more than $400,000. He died in 1988 
of complications from the wound.

John Denver hasn't had a hit record in 10 years, but he says his voice has 
improved with age. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, who will perform Wednesday at the Deer Creek Music Center north of 
Indianapolis, said he struggled during the 1980s to keep his career afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always hard to get my songs on the radio," he said. "But when they did 
get airplay, a lot of people liked the music, and I still have an unusually 
large audience for not having had a hit record in that time." 
</P>
<P>
Denver's album "Earth Songs," which is sold through the National Wildlife 
Federation, includes new versions of the hits "Sunshine on My Shoulders," 
"Rocky Mountain High" and "The Eagle and the Hawk." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm singing so much differently than I was 20 years ago," Denver said. 
"There's a much greater range of emotion in each and every word. And I'm 
singing better. All of that tends to make it a different recording."

BUCHWALD JUDGE MAY TELL STUDIO TO OPEN RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
FILMS: COURT IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ITS OWN EXPERT TO INVESTIGATE 
PARAMOUNT'S PROFITABILITY.

<P>
The judge in Art Buchwald's suit against Paramount Pictures said today he may 
order the studio to open all of its financial records to determine how much 
money it must pay Buchwald for the movie "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider said he is also considering appointing 
his own expert to investigate the accounting records and all financial books on 
Paramount's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear to me that I have all the facts I need on those issues," 
Schneider said as he announced more than 30 tentative views on legal issues in 
the lawsuit that is expected to have an impact on the way Hollywood does 
business. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he understands that there are internal profit-and-loss statements 
that have not been provided to Buchwald and his writing partner, producer Alain 
Bernheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to see these," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider ruled last January that Paramount's hit movie "Coming to America" was 
based on a treatment Buchwald submitted. The studio maintained that the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist's treatment, "King for a Day," was not the 
basis of the film starring Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Today's hearing was to determine how much money Paramount owed Buchwald and 
Bernheim. 
</P>
<P>
The studio has maintained that the two are owed nothing because the movie has 
not turned a profit although it has taken in more than $270 million at the box 
office. Buchwald claimed in court papers that he and Bernheim are owed between 
$6.9 million and $14.6 million.

Rue McClanahan and Casey Kasem criticized the judge in a trial over a monkey 
trainer's defamation complaint against an animal rights group. 
</P>
<P>
The two spoke to reporters Saturday and criticized state District Judge Myron 
Leavitt's participation in the case brought by Bobby Berosini. 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan, who appears on NBC's "Golden Girls," Kasem of radio's "American Top 
40" and actress Peggy McCay, all animal rights activists, said Leavitt had 
taken contributions from the Stardust Hotel, where Berosini performs. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is not involved in the trial between Berosini and People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals. 
</P>
<P>
Berosini is suing PETA for $80 million, claiming that the organization 
slandered him by releasing a videotape showing him disciplining orangutans used 
in his show.

CLAY'S EX: HE USED TO BE NICE

Even though Kathy Swanson is suing Andrew Dice Clay for $6 million, she wants 
people to know the comedian who once was her husband used to be sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, who left her family's rural Iowa farm to seek success in Hollywood, 
said she and Clay met in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Their first date included buying a bottle of wine at a convenience store and 
sitting in front of a fake log in his fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
They spent a chaste night together on the sofa, sleeping, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like he tied me to a pedestal. He was very protective of me, and that 
was fine at the time," Swanson said in an interview with the Des Moines Sunday 
Register. 
</P>
<P>
They lived together for four years, married in 1984 and were divorced two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Although her ex-husband -- whose act has been criticized as misogynist, 
homophobic and otherwise bigoted -- always tended to view women "as barefoot, 
pregnant and walking 10 feet behind you," she said, his barbs grew more 
vehement. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said that Clay manipulated her and that she did not get her own lawyer 
when they divorced. Her lawyer now, Marvin Mitchelson, said the divorce decree 
settled $4,000 in debts and paid Swanson $1,000 a month for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Her suit seeks $3 million in shared property and an equal amount in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
Clay's lawyers have declined to comment.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HOME REMEDIES COULD SOOTHE THE PAIN OF COLD SORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I get cold sores whenever we go to the beach. They are extremely 
painful and the scars last quite a while. My doctor tells me there is no cure. 
Is there a home remedy that I could use on my vacation this month? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Over the years we have received lots of home remedies from readers. We 
cannot vouch for any of them, but here they are. 
</P>
<P>
One man swears by buttermilk. He writes, "After suffering for several years I 
asked a doctor about treating fever blisters. His reply was not very 
encouraging. My pharmacist said to drink buttermilk. I tried it. It's easy and 
cheap and it has really cut down on the number of fever blisters I have 
suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Another reader suggests douching powder applied to the sore. She says dabbing a 
little Massengill or Bo-Car-Al on the blister overnight helps speed healing. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative would be the prescription medicine Zovirax (acyclovir). It is 
available as an ointment or in pill form. Although it is not a cure it can also 
speed healing or perhaps even prevent an outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
You should also use a lip balm containing an effective sunscreen. This may 
eliminate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My wife and her mother both have high cholesterol. Even eating a very 
low-fat diet has done little to lower it. 
</P>
<P>
They both take Dyazide and have for many years. I have read in the paper that 
Dyazide can raise cholesterol. How much does it affect cholesterol readings? Is 
there a good substitute for Dyazide that does not increase the cholesterol 
count? 
</P>
<P>
A. Many people find it difficult to lower cholesterol even with a strict 
low-fat diet. Some medicines may compound the problem, though. Thiazide 
diuretics such as Dyazide may make it a little harder to achieve the desired 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are other blood pressure medications that are less likely to 
raise blood fats. Only your wife's physician can decide which drug is most 
appropriate for her.

ONCE-SWAGGERING REDS FEEL THE HEAT OF A PENNANT RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds learned how to swagger in the first half of the season. In 
the second half, they are remembering how to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
A National League West title appeared inevitable for the Reds two weeks ago, 
when they opened an 11-game lead over San Francisco. A two-week nose dive has 
turned the runaway into a race, and the Reds feel it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going through as bad a stretch as anybody can go through," pitcher Norm 
Charlton said. "Most of the guys are still holding their heads up." 
</P>
<P>
They have taken to burying their heads in their hands these last two weeks, 
trying to forget about mental lapses that made them fall flat on their faces in 
what was expected to be a second-half victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's a period to forget," Manager Lou Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
It started July 24 in San Diego. The Reds had beaten the Padres, 9-2, the 
previous day to go up 11 games, their biggest lead of the season, at the start 
of an 11-game West Coast trip. One columnist dubbed the trip a mop-up mission. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds got mopped up instead, losing their next eight games before winning 
the final two of the trip. They returned home and lost three of four over the 
weekend to San Diego, allowing the Giants to get within 3 1/2 games before 
falling back to 4 1/2 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
So much for a quick knockout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new season," Piniella said. "It's down to a 56-game season. What 
happened to date is history. It depends on who plays best the next 56 games." 
</P>
<P>
Some Reds fans figure it should not have come to this. They fear yet another 
summer swoon like the ones under former Manager Pete Rose, who led the Reds to 
four straight second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds insist this year will be different. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone acts after every loss now like we're in a state where we're going to 
lose this thing," pitcher Danny Jackson said. "There are two months left. It's 
going to be two months of hard-fought baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to win it. There's no doubt in my mind we're going to win it." 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt in anyone's mind when the Reds got off to their best 
start this century, going 23-7 with nine season-opening victories. They are 
just 39-37 since, including 12-15 since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
The swoon brings to mind the 1982 Atlanta Braves, who opened the season with 13 
victories to build a large lead but let it slip away by later losing 19 of 21. 
They won the NL West title by one game on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
The method to the skid has been as maddening as the results. 
</P>
<P>
No one area of performance can be blamed for the slump, which has included five 
one-run losses. Key shortcomings have been a lack of clutch hitting, poor 
baserunning and inconsistent relief pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"The team that stays away from mistakes wins," Piniella said. "We've made too 
many mistakes the last two weeks."

Robert Rodenkirchen, a world-class sprinter who refused Hitler's request to 
represent Nazi Germany in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, has died of a heart 
attack at age 74. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Cologne, Germany, Rodenkirchen came to the United States with his 
family as a child. 
</P>
<P>
After qualifying for the 1936 U.S. Olympic team in the trials, Rodenkirchen was 
denied a spot when someone discovered his father had never obtained U.S. 
citizenship for himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
While Rodenkirchen was on the rubbing table for a race at Princeton University 
in 1936, the German ambassador to the United States hand-delivered a letter 
from Adolf Hitler. The letter invited the 19-year-old athlete to represent 
Germany in the Olympics that year as a representative of the Aryan race. 
</P>
<P>
Rodenkirchen refused, according to press reports at the time. "I never finished 
the letter," he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Rodenkirchen, who died Friday, competed for North Texas State and Cornell 
universities and set a world record at the 1936 Olympic trial semifinals by 
running the 200-meter dash in 21.2 seconds.

END OF COPYRIGHT SOUGHT ON 'BROOKLYN DODGERS'

Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden, displaying the feistiness 
Brooklynites hold dear, said today he had asked the city to seek a court order 
declaring the name "Brooklyn Dodgers" to be in the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
Golden asked the city corporation counsel to take the action to head off a 
lawsuit filed by the Los Angeles Dodgers against two men who are using the name 
"Brooklyn Dodgers" on their two restaurants in the Bay Ridge and Kensington 
sections of the borough. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, claims the team that 
abandoned Brooklyn more than 30 years ago retains sole rights to the "Brooklyn 
Dodger" name. 
</P>
<P>
Golden said that, if the name became part of the public domain, it could be 
used freely by anybody without the restriction of a copyright or trademark. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn Dodgers, who played in Ebbets Field, left for Los Angeles in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodger name was born in Brooklyn," Golden said in a statement. "It grew to 
glory in Brooklyn and it is an instrinsic part of Brooklyn's history. It is a 
basic part of what we are as Brooklynites, never-say-die underdogs, 
wait-til-next-year fighters." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York City corporation counsel 
were not immediately available for comment.

Seattle Mariners pitcher Bill Swift, struck on the forehead by a line drive 
while pitching against Minnesota, was released today from a hospital where he 
was checked for injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander will be reevaluated Tuesday, but all tests were normal and he 
was expected to make his next start Saturday, the Mariners said in a press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Swift, 28, was bruised on the right side of his forehead when he was hit by a 
line drive off the bat of Gary Gaetti in the fourth inning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to Providence Hospital, where he was tested and remained overnight 
for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Swift lay sprawled on the mound for several minutes after he was hit but never 
lost consciousness and was able to walk off the field with assistance.

Eric Dickerson, relenting on his earlier vows he would never again play for the 
Indianapolis Colts, arrived in town today for a physical examination before 
heading to training camp at Anderson University. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said in a telephone interview from 
California that Dickerson changed his mind. "Our sense of it was that valid 
contracts need to be honored," Steinberg said. "So it made sense for Eric to go 
back and fulfill his commitments." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg would not say whether Dickerson was happy with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's there to play football. He's under contract to the Colts. He'll play for 
the Colts. As to his state of mind, you can ask him," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has been AWOL from training camp since July 26, accumulating $1,500 a 
day in fines. He refused to talk to the media as he arrived at a Methodist 
Hospital clinic and said only, "I'll talk to y'all later." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg was brought in by Dickerson last week to help mend a sour 
relationship between the NFL's seventh-leading rusher, who has been sharply 
critical of the team during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson's verbal war with the team has included threats to retire and 
criticism of the offensive line and management. He has been particularly 
critical of the trade of perennial All-Pro offensive tackle Chris Hinton to 
Atlanta as part of the deal that brought quarterback Jeff George to the Colts 
as the league's top draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
George signed a six-year, $15-million contract, a deal that may have been 
another blow to the ego of Dickerson -- a six-time Pro Bowl selection. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said he doubted the acquisition of George would turn the Colts into 
an instant contender for the Super Bowl and demanded a trade. But the Colts 
have said they never received a suitable offer for the seven-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a second Colts' player AWOL from camp, quarterback Chris Chandler, 
was flying to Florida today, and his agent, Mike Sullivan, confirmed that 
Chandler had agreed to be traded to Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris is very, very happy with the deal," he said.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: PICKING WINNERS LIKE EXAMINING GEMS, JEWELER FINDS 
</P>

On June 28 at Hollywood Park, Speaking Part, running a six-furlong sprint 
against fillies and mares for 4-year-olds and up, started out fourth in a 
12-horse field after breaking from the No. 2 post position. Speaking Part moved 
up to third at the quarter-pole and took over second at the half-mile position. 
By the stretch, the horse was in front by a head. Extending her lead, Speaking 
Part won by three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
When the mutuels were posted on the totalizator board, the "Gem" wasn't even at 
the track, although he had his first winner of the day. The horse paid $32.40 
to win, and system backers were off to a good start after losing the first 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The Gem never gets to the track until the eighth race, after closing his store, 
which he has had for many years, in the Jewelry Mart building in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Being meticulous and precise, the Gem first conducts whatever business enters 
his shop, whether it's designing pieces of jewelry or selling items he buys 
from other designers. A creative type, artistic in nature, the Gem would rather 
design rings, pins and bracelets and enter them in various national and 
international competitions than actually sell them to his customers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, despite the huge sums of money his creative pieces would bring, the 
Gem gives many of them to his wife to wear, and that way keeps them in his 
possession, instead of selling them to his rich customers, many of whom travel 
to his shop from all over California. 
</P>
<P>
The Gem's system is a simple one, which he designed after studying the local 
newspaper's horse-racing pages. What he does is bet a money-progression system 
to win on the nine top horses chosen by one of the local newspaper 
handicappers. With a progression of $5-10-15-20-25-30-35-40-45, the Gem needs 
$225 a day for his betting. 
</P>
<P>
On June 28, the Gem was betting on the picks of Pat Ray, who is one of the 
handicappers listed in the Consensus box published on racing days in the Sports 
Section of The Times and who was the leading money winner among those listed. 
</P>
<P>
Ray had a loser the first race when his pick, Wildly Irish, going off the 
favorite, ran sixth in a nine-horse route. After losing $5, the Gem's friend 
bet $10 on Speaking Part, which returned $162. After deducting the $15 bet on 
the first two races, the Gem was ahead $147. 
</P>
<P>
The third race turned out to be another good bet for the Gem when Ray's top 
choice, Intrepidness, ran in a six-furlong sprint against 3-year-olds. Breaking 
slowly from the No. 3 post position, Intrepidness settled into sixth at the 
start, beating only two horses out of the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining his rhythm by the quarter-pole, Intrepidness moved up to fourth by the 
half-mile and at that point made a bold move, taking a one-length lead into the 
stretch, where he pulled away to win by two lengths. With the horse paying 
$10.40 for every $2 bet, the Gem received $78, profiting by $63 on the race and 
$210 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth race turned out to be Ray's and the Gem's third consecutive victory. 
Quite Regal took the lead at the three-quarter pole, opened up four lengths in 
the stretch and coasted to a 6 1/2-length win in a 1 1/16-mile race. Being the 
favorite, the horse paid $4.60, bringing the Gem $46 for his $20 bet and profit 
for the day hit $236. 
</P>
<P>
When Fraulein Maria came in sixth in the fifth race, the Gem lost $25, cutting 
his winnings to $211. However, in the sixth race, Free Love, running 5 1/2 
furlongs, started out second, entered the stretch 1 1/2 lengths in front of the 
11-horse field, and easily finished first by 3 1/2 lengths, paying $5.40 to 
win. For his $30 wager, the Gem received $81, made $51, and increased his total 
winnings to $262. 
</P>
<P>
Orrefor ran last in the seventh race and although the Gem dropped $35, he was 
still ahead a hefty $227 for the day. Arriving at the track just before the 
start of the eighth race, the Gem watched Ray's selection, Flirty, take the 
lead at the beginning of a 1 1/16-mile route on the turf. Flirty opened up 1 
1/2 lengths at the quarter-pole, maintained her position entering the stretch 
and held off the fast-closing second-place horse to win by a head. 
</P>
<P>
Racing as an entry with the second-place finisher, Flirty ended up the favorite 
in the race paying $4.60 to win. The $40 bet resulted in a return of $92 and a 
profit of $52. Now the Gem was ahead $279 with only one more race to go. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bet for the ninth would only be $45, the Gem knew he couldn't lose 
for the day. He calmly plunked his money down on Ray's choice, 
Excellentperformer, and watched as the nag made a move to third entering the 
stretch. In the stretch, however, the horse tired and ended up fourth. Despite 
the loss, the Gem left the track with a $234 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Another good day for the Gem was on July 5, when Ray again hit five firsts, 
winning the second, third, fifth, seventh and ninth races. What made the day's 
betting more satisfying than most days was winning the ninth race, when No 
Money, No Honey raced a mile against six other horses. The nag ran second 
through most of the race until the stretch where she passed the tiring Bigger 
Ability and raced to a half-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
No Money, No Honey paid $7.20 and the Gem received $162 for his $45 wager. With 
a profit of $117, the Gem left the track ahead $178.50 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Gem concedes that despite his good fortune in choosing a hot handicapper 
most of the time, betting on the horses is similar to identifying a good gem. 
By just looking at a gem, it is almost impossible to see if the inside is 
flawed. However, when one looks through a magnifying glass, then the flaws 
stand out. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of a horse, he says. If one just looks at the animal, there is 
no way of seeing the heart inside. However, in the case of the horse, it is the 
magnified competition that brings out the heart.

Aug. 6, 1990 -- Forty-five years later, residents of Hiroshima today mourned 
the 140,000 victims of the 1945 atomic bomb attack with a solemn look back and 
a note of optimism for the future as tensions ease between the Soviet Union and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For one eerie moment, the city fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
Taxis and street cars stopped, and people throughout this industrial center of 
1 million joined in a moment of prayer for the souls of those killed in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Dignitaries, Hiroshima residents and foreign guests bowed their heads at 8:15 
a.m., the exact moment the bomb exploded in a blinding flash of light. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony, officials added 5,551 names of people exposed to the bomb who 
died over the last year to the names enshrined in a granite cenotaph, raising 
the total of claimed victims to 167,243.

SECOND THOUGHTS ON SOCRATES; 
</P>
<P>
PHILOSOPHY: FOR 30 YEARS WHAT GREGORY VLASTOS THOUGHT ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHER 
CAME TO BE WHAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT. BUT NOW VLASTOS IS REVISING HIMSELF.

<TEXT>
<P>
Working from his home above the UC Berkeley campus, Gregory Vlastos looks out 
across the San Francisco Bay as its morning fog drifts toward the city famous 
for its precipitous slopes. 
</P>
<P>
But the philosopher's thoughts are wandering through another renowned hilltop 
metropolis, that of ancient Athens, itself much obscured by nearly 2 1/2 
milleniums of history. 
</P>
<P>
Internationally eminent as a historian of ancient Greek philosophy, Vlastos, 
who recently turned 83, has pioneered current thinking about one of the 
city-state's most illustrious citizens, Socrates. Roaming the marketplace in 
his well-worn coat, button-holing merchants and youths with his insistent 
questions, Socrates "brought philosophy from heaven to earth," in the acclaimed 
words of the Roman orator, Cicero. At a time when other thinkers were either 
speculating on the nature of the cosmos or cultivating the esoterica of 
metaphysics, Socrates began his analyses of human conduct, and in so doing 
helped to lay the philosophical foundation of Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
Vlastos, who is also Greek, has spent more than 30 years patiently striving to 
better understand the ideas of his countryman, whose life spanned 70 years from 
approximately 470 to 399 BC. The fruits of his labors are now twofold: Last 
month the octogenarian philosopher became the recipient of a $375,000 MacArthur 
Foundation Fellowship, awarded for creative endeavors by the John D. and 
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and, in the process, tied two former winners 
for the record of oldest honoree. In addition, next spring, his scholarly 
exploration will culminate in the publication of his book, "Socrates, Ironist 
and Moral Philosopher" (Cornell University Press and Cambridge University Press 
in England). 
</P>
<P>
According to specialists in ancient Greek philosophy, Vlastos, like Socrates, 
has done much to humanize the field at a time when emphasis is being placed on 
the logical validity of arguments rather than the substance of thought. 
</P>
<P>
"He has shown that philosophy can speak with a public voice and address 
problems that are of concern to everyone," says Alexander Nehamus, professor of 
philosophy at Princeton University and a former student of Vlastos. 
</P>
<P>
Along with British philosopher, G.E.L. Owen, Vlastos, says Nehamus, 
"established Greek philosophy as a serious field of study in America." 
Previously, "philosophy in America was unhistorical," and concerned more with 
solving contemporary problems. Vlastos showed there was relevance in the 
solution of problems bequeathed by ancient philosophers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Vlastos formed the generally accepted view of Socrates as a 
negative thinker who pointed out contradictions in other people's thinking, 
says Nehamus. His new book, he believes, "is going to change the way Socrates 
is being seen within philosophy. It's Vlastos revising Vlastos, but at the same 
time it's Vlastos revising common sense, because what he thought about Socrates 
for the past 30 years came to be what everybody thought about Socrates." 
</P>
<P>
Vlastos, who regrets that scholars have come to depict Socrates as a dull 
moralist, now presents a dynamic positive figure whose views had a charismatic 
influence on the youth of his time and have an immediate relationship to our 
own. In the late 20th Century he would be a brilliant debunker of hocus-pocus 
in issues of public morality. 
</P>
<P>
"We could use a whole platoon of people like Socrates," says Vlastos, who bears 
on his cane to ease himself into a living room chair. Suffering from bone 
cancer, which has left him frail, he nonetheless speaks forcefully, with the 
sort of fearless assertions and brisk ironic gusts of humor that are said to 
have characterized Socrates. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important single thing about Socrates is his insistence on clear 
thinking," says Vlastos. "There's a tremendous amount of fuzzy thinking today, 
particularly on the topic of morals, which allows ecclesiastical dogmas to be 
slipped in on us, like the questions of contraception and abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Vlastos, who attacks anti-abortion arguments with alacrity, finds "the idea 
that a fertilized ovum, within a day of its fertilization, is a person is 
simply absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the wrongness of reasoning, he says, is the fact that this dogma 
has been foisted off on a nation whose constitution proclaims the separation of 
church and State. 
</P>
<P>
"Socrates would have had a field day pointing out these absurdities," he 
declares. 
</P>
<P>
As the critic of the public conscience, Socrates, says Vlastos, would have a 
plateful of issues on which to speak: 
</P>
<P>
* Donald Trump: "He would really press him as to whether he can find happiness 
by piling up endless quantities of money and possessions." 
</P>
<P>
* The slashing of funds from social services and concurrent support for 
military defense: "The only way we apply modern technology, which can produce 
unlimited quantities of wealth, is by running into military crises and then 
diverting vast amounts of money to the production of 'illth,' which is the 
opposite of wealth." 
</P>
<P>
* The ethics of the Ronald Reagan era: "He was a great joker. . . . He had no 
compassion for others less fortunate than himself. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kinds of questions Socrates loved to address," Vlastos states, 
"the problems which real human beings have to face in real life." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the media would give him the opportunity to reach an audience of 
millions, rather than a scattering of individuals. "Socrates would be a prime 
subject for TV talk shows," says Vlastos. "He had something of substance to say 
and he would say it with wit and irony and fearlessness." 
</P>
<P>
The most important moral lesson that Socrates taught, and one to which Socratic 
students have not previously given proper attention, Vlastos believes, is his 
rejection of the principle of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was a very well-established 
principle of morality in Greece," he says, "far stronger" than it is in today's 
society, with Greeks commonly supplicating the gods to take vengeance on their 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Socrates held that "if your only reason for hurting someone is that that 
person did a nasty thing to you, that is totally unjustified," Vlastos says. 
"This is the principle that wrought havoc in the ancient world," setting Athens 
and Sparta in a nearly 30-year war of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it was to refute the principle of retaliation that Socrates, who was 
sentenced to death for impiety and the corruption of the city's youth, chose to 
drink the poisonous hemlock, the state's method of inflicting death, rather 
than accepting the escape from prison that his friends had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"The argument that was made to him was 'the Athenians have done you dirt. 
They've condemned you unjustly. So you should feel free to do whatever is most 
advantageous to your personal safety,' " says Vlastos. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Socrates obeyed the lawful punishment of the city, which, he 
recognized, had allowed him the freedom to question traditional platitudes for 
most of his life, a freedom he would not have enjoyed in Sparta. 
</P>
<P>
It is such an act of integrity that separates Socrates from American notables 
of our day, Vlastos thinks. Although there are some celebrated thinkers, he 
finds, "people with true integrity are quite rare in our society. I can't think 
of a contemporary Socrates." 
</P>
<P>
His style was in diametrical opposition to popular contemporary celebrities. 
Considered ugly by Greek standards of aesthetics, he was slightly pop-eyed and 
snub-nosed with large flaring nostrils (the better to take in fresh air, he 
would joke, Vlastos says), though as his pupil Plato wrote, he was "all 
glorious within." And rather than trumpeting his importance, says Vlastos, "he 
was always running himself down." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, he invented irony, Vlastos says. "He'd come up to you and say, 
'Oh, you look like a very wise lady to me. Now what do you think about this and 
that.' And pretty soon it would appear that your wisdom was a little bit 
over-rated." 
</P>
<P>
He was suspicious of politics, refused to become entangled with wealth, and 
felt his life's mission, commanded by God, was to examine himself and provoke 
self-examination among the citizens of Athens. 
</P>
<P>
He used language with striking virtuosity, engaging young men in debate on the 
benches of the city's gymnasia, at the same time that they developed their 
physical powers. 
</P>
<P>
But if Socrates flourished as a conspicuous celebrity, Vlastos points out, it 
was because he was part and parcel of a society in which intellectual prowess 
was highly prized. The word and the act of philosophizing, as it is known in 
Western civilization, are Greek in origin, as is "the idea that fundamental 
principles are all susceptible to rational criticism -- all of them," Vlastos 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"The Greeks had a much livelier intellect than appears in our young people 
whose minds are stupefied by TV and other essentially passive entertainments 
which don't call on them to exert their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"The general atmosphere of the age is not critical. In our society we have this 
success bug." Consequently, Vlastos says, "one adopts the conventional signs of 
good behavior and becomes very wary of departing from established habits." 
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, results in "the fact that people are buffaloed by all these 
uncritical dogmas," which Vlastos thinks is the source of "so many of our 
problems today." 
</P>
<P>
Vlastos' own critical thought was formed at an early age in the particularly 
Socratic manner of one-on-one tutoring, which he continues to tout in 
opposition to classroom instruction. Raised among the Greek minority in a 
Turkish village on the Bosphorus Sea, he received his schooling from his 
mother, proving its efficacy by entering Istanbul's (then Constantinople) 
American-run Robert College at the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
Graduating three years later, he left to study for the Congregational ministry 
on a fellowship at the Chicago Theological Seminary. For a summer he served as 
pastor in the hamlet of Beverly, Mass., before earning a doctorate in 
philosophy at Harvard University and opting for a life studying secular 
morality. 
</P>
<P>
Devoting so many years to the examination of Socrates' thoughts has greatly 
influenced his own life, Vlastos says. "You can't help it, living with a man 
like that who is a person of complete integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Like Socrates, he has spent much of his life teaching, influencing the thoughts 
of two generations of students. A professor of philosophy at Princeton 
University for 21 years, he retired in 1976 and became professor emeritus at UC 
Berkeley, leaving that post three years ago. He has also been a visiting 
professor at St. Andrews University in Scotland and Cambridge University, 
England, where he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. 
</P>
<P>
He has also achieved a Socratic moderation in his life, which he partially 
credits for his longevity. "That's one reason I've lived to my present age," he 
says, musing that he has presently outlived Socrates by 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Having survived his wife (he has a daughter in Alhambra and a son in Iowa), he 
spends most of his time in his secluded hillside house, which he finds 
conducive to thought. Since his illness, however, days of strenuous work have 
given way to three hours of morning writing. He has been working on his book 
for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased I finished it," he says, allowing himself a modest measure of 
self-satisfaction. "I thought my illness would finish me off before I finished 
the book. But I won, and now I hope to write a second volume."

THIS PITCHER TRULY DESERVED AN AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CY YOUNG WON 511 GAMES IN HIS REMARKABLE CAREER. THE FIRST OF THOSE 
CAME 100 YEARS AGO TODAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One hundred years ago today, in a rickety little baseball park in Cleveland, 
one of the great careers in American sports began. 
</P>
<P>
Denton True (Cy) Young, a 6-foot-2 Ohio farm boy with ax-handle shoulders, 
appeared in his first major league game as the starting pitcher for the 
National League Cleveland Spiders in beating the Chicago Colts, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up three hits, struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cleveland Leader and Herald's story: "Mr. Young is a tall, very well 
put-together and athletic young man of sundry summers. He doesn't pitch the 
ball but rather sends lessons in geometry up to the batter with a request for 
solution. Mr. Young knows almost as much about curves as an engineer on a West 
Virginia railroad." 
</P>
<P>
One down, 510 to go. Twenty-one years later, in 1911, Young pitched his final 
game, at 43 . . . after having won 511 games. 
</P>
<P>
If Nolan Ryan, who just won his 300th game at 43, could continue and averaged 
20 wins a season through the year 2000, he would reach 500 wins, at age 53. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, when Young was 71, he visited the New York Giants' spring training 
camp at Hot Springs, Ark. A newspaper editor there assigned a young reporter, 
apparently not a baseball fan, to interview Young. 
</P>
<P>
The young reporter asked the old pitcher: "Mr. Young, did you ever pitch in the 
big leagues?" 
</P>
<P>
A scowl clouded the old man's face. He placed a hand on the cub reporter's 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Son," he said, "I won more games in the big leagues than you will ever see!" 
</P>
<P>
Cy Young's numbers, from a career that straddled two centuries: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Between 1891 and 1904, when he won 396 games, he averaged 28 victories per 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He won his 100th game late in his third full season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of his 906 major league games, he completed 750, 110 more than anyone else 
on the all-time list. In 1901, when he was 33-10, he appeared in 43 games and 
completed 38. -- Fifteen times he won 20 or more games in a season, and five 
times won 30. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his greatest season, 1892, he was 36-12, with a 1.93 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At ages 40, 41 and 42, he posted 21-15, 21-11 and 19-15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His 511 victories (Young always insisted it was 512) seem more unassailable 
than Babe Ruth's home run records ever did. Only one other pitcher ever won 400 
games (Walter Johnson, 416). Of the 20 pitchers who have won 300, 12 won less 
than 330. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And one little Cy Young number: His highest major league salary was $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, turn-of-the century baseball shouldn't be confused with today's 
game. In Young's first three big league seasons, when he won 72 games, the 
distance between the pitcher's slab and home plate was 50 feet. In 1893, it was 
lengthened to 60 feet, 6 inches. Young admitted, in a 1940 interview, to the 
advantages of pitching in his era. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the benefit of a larger strike zone, from the top of the shoulders to 
the bottom of the knees," he said. "And I admit that some of my cut-plug 
tobacco sometimes got on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"But I also played on poor fields, with poor equipment, ate bad food, had bad 
travel conditions, sooty trains, hotels with no shower-baths, noisy rooming 
houses . . . some of them with bed bugs that kept you up all night." 
</P>
<P>
Cy Young's career returns to baseball's consciousness each time a pitcher wins 
his 300th game. And this time, 79 years after Young's last season, there are 
some similarities between the game's latest 300-game winner and Young. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost a baseball cliche that Nolan Ryan should will his right arm to a 
museum or to the Baseball Hall of Fame, because he's been throwing hard for 22 
seasons with scarcely a twinge. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, better that Young's arm should have been enshrined. There's never 
been another like it. 
</P>
<P>
Young pitched, like Ryan, into his 40s. And also like Ryan, Young never lost 
much velocity on his fastball. His problem was his stomach. It got too big. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing his career in 1940, Young indicated that if the bunt had been 
outlawed, he might have pitched into his 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had to have a trainer rub my arm the whole time I was in baseball," he 
said, fifty years ago. "I quit because other teams started bunting on me and I 
couldn't field my position any more. I figured when the third baseman had to 
start doing my work, too, it was time to quit." 
</P>
<P>
"My arm was weak and tired at times, but never sore, even though I worked 
usually with just two days rest and often with just one. I always credited it 
to my legs and my off-season conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran regularly to keep my legs in shape. In the spring I'd run constantly for 
three weeks before I ever threw a ball. And I worked hard all winter on my 
farm, sunup to sundown, doing chores that were good not only for my legs but 
also for my arms and back. 
</P>
<P>
"Swinging an ax hardens the hands and builds up the shoulders and back. I only 
needed a dozen pitches to warm up for a game." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that Young's numbers are rendered hazy today, owing to a changed 
game. (Can anyone imagine a manager today asking a pitcher to start both ends 
of an August doubleheader in, say, St. Louis?) But there can be no argument 
over what kind of right arm he had. 
</P>
<P>
A hard thrower according to every account, Young pitched 300 innings in 16 
seasons and five times pitched more than 400 innings. Last season, Bret 
Saberhagen led the major leagues with 262. Young was said to be a very strong 
man. In his prime, he was 6-2 and 210 pounds. His teammates called him "Chief." 
Only later in his career did he develop a substantial paunch. 
</P>
<P>
But his strength never waned. In his 80s, he enjoyed gripping a baseball with 
his huge, gnarled hand and challenging anyone to pry his fingers off the ball.

<P>
For a pitcher who won 511 games, he started comparatively late. He was 23 when 
he appeared in his first major league. Little is known of his early life, other 
than he was born two years after the Civil War ended, that he grew up on a farm 
near the little town of Gilmore, Ohio. He was called Dent Young as a boy. His 
middle name, True, was the last name of a Union Army captain who'd saved the 
life of his father in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
His hard-working grandparents, who raised him, discouraged their grandson's 
fondness for baseball. Finally, they relented in 1890, allowing him to attend a 
tryout with the Canton team in the Tri-State League. 
</P>
<P>
On his first workout with Canton, the team's catcher couldn't handle his 
fastball. Home plate was close to the wooden grandstands and several of Young's 
practice pitches crashed into the boards and broke them. As legend has it, 
someone commented that the bleachers looked as if they'd been hit by a cyclone. 
</P>
<P>
So for a day or two, he was "Cyclone" Young, until a teammate trimmed it to 
"Cy." 
</P>
<P>
He was an instant sensation with Canton and at midseason was sold, for $250, to 
Cleveland. Young received a bonus in the transaction: a new suit. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched in Cleveland until 1899, when that franchise moved to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the 20th Century began, he'd won 286 games. 
</P>
<P>
When the American League was formed in 1901, Young accepted an offer of a 
$600-a-year raise to jump to the Boston Red Sox. He was making $3,000, the 
highest salary in baseball. On Oct. 1, 1903, playing for the Boston Pilgrims, 
Cy Young threw the first pitch in the first World Series game. He also became 
the first pitcher to lose a World Series game that day. The Honus Wagner-led 
Pittsburgh Pirates scored four times in the first inning and beat Young, 7-3. 
Fifty years later, Young was asked to throw the first pitch to open the 1953 
World Series at Yankee Stadium. From the pitcher's mound, at age 86, he threw a 
strike to the Yankees' catcher, Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
He threw three no-hitters in his career. The second one, against Philadelphia 
on May 5, 1904, was a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing pitcher that day in Boston was another future Hall of Famer, Rube 
Waddell. Decades later, Young remembered the final hitter in that game was 
Waddell, who popped out to left. Time of game: One hour, 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Waddell hooked up in another masterpiece on July 4, 1905. Young, then 
38, battled Waddell for 20 innings before losing, 4-2. Young didn't walk a 
batter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1908, when he was 41, he pitched his third no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1908, Cy Young received the original Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
American League players chipped in to buy a loving cup, and it was presented to 
Young at a Boston banquet. The inscription on the cup: "From the ball players 
of the American League to show their appreciation of Cy Young, as a man and as 
a ball player. August 13, 1908." 
</P>
<P>
Young pitched for Boston through 1908, when he was sold for $12,500 to 
Cleveland, which by then had an American League team. 
</P>
<P>
The portly Young retired in the spring of 1912, when hitters began running him 
ragged with bunts. He returned to his Ohio farm and worked dawn to dusk until 
the 1933 death of his wife, Robba. 
</P>
<P>
He sold his land and moved in with friends who owned a farm in nearby 
Newcomerstown, explaining he could no longer live anymore in the house he'd 
share with his wife for 41 years. In the mid-1940s, the federal government 
wanted to close the post office in nearby Peoli, but kept it open for another 
decade, solely to handle the volume of mail Young still received. In his last 
years, he was immensely proud of his baseball achievements -- even of those not 
credited to him. 
</P>
<P>
Young attended a 1940 World Series game in Cincinnati, where sportswriter 
Grantland Rice introduced him in the press room. Rice said to his colleagues: 
"Gentlemen, I want you to meet Cy Young -- he won 511 ball games . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Interrupted Young: "Five hundred and twelve, Granny -- I won one they never 
gave me credit for." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1945 interview, Ty Cobb discussed Young's prowess. 
</P>
<P>
"Cy had been pitching 15 years before I came to the Tigers, but he was still a 
great pitcher," Cobb said. "He was a big, burly fellow and he could hide that 
ball better than anyone else I ever saw. He would turn his back to you in the 
windup and the ball would be on you. Cy had fine speed, a good curve and 
perfect control. He could pitch into a tin cup." 
</P>
<P>
In the autumn of his life, when the great victories had receded into the fog of 
all the years, Young simply faded away one afternoon in 1955, on the front 
porch of the Ohio farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Cy Young was dead. Hundreds of people, including Hall of Famers Bob Feller and 
Tris Speaker, attended his funeral. Sadly, Young never knew baseball's most 
prestigious award would be named for him the next year by baseball Commissioner 
Ford Frick. 
</P>
<P>
He lies today next to his wife in a quiet church cemetery, at Peoli, Ohio, 
beneath a huge elm. On his marker, a winged baseball appears to be flying off 
the granite headstone, toward some unseen batter.

THE LAW: KENNETH I. CLAYMAN'S OFFICE DEFENDS POOR CLIENTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS. HE CLAIMS INSPIRATION FROM TELEVISION'S PERRY MASON.

<P>
In the 1940s, Kenneth I. Clayman was a skinny, argumentative kid, the son of 
Russian immigrant grocers in New Rochelle, N.Y. By 1949, Clayman and his 
parents had moved to San Diego to operate an egg ranch and to ease his father's 
asthma. 
</P>
<P>
And as Clayman got older and more argumentative, his friends began picking on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was . . . a little on the obnoxious side," said Clayman, 48. "They'd say, 
'Why don't you become a lawyer?' " 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was that wiseacre suggestion. Maybe it was all the teasing he took for 
his beanpole frame, which eventually grew to 6 feet, 5 inches. Maybe it was all 
those episodes of "Perry Mason" he watched on television. 
</P>
<P>
But something drove Clayman to become a criminal defense lawyer. And something 
made him take one of the most difficult, low-paying jobs a lawyer can have -- 
deputy public defender in Los Angeles -- and eventually take what may be one of 
the toughest jobs for a defense lawyer in California -- public defender in 
Ventura County -- where prosecutors last year won 82% of jury trials and 87% of 
trials before judges. 
</P>
<P>
Now Clayman oversees 37 lawyers, who represent poor clients charged in simple 
traffic offenses to complex murder cases. During six years in the post, he has 
earned respect as a diplomatic administrator and staunch defender of 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Defending criminals is not the most popular thing in Ventura County, and it's 
a difficult job to begin with -- it's kind of like being Scrooge at 
Christmastime," said Supervisor James Dougherty. "Everybody wants to put the 
bad guys in jail, and he's doing his best to make sure their constitutional 
rights are protected. Not everybody appreciates that." 
</P>
<P>
Public defenders are unpopular because "they have to stand up for the underdog, 
who many times is a somewhat unpopular if not despicable individual," said Mark 
S. Borrell, president of the Ventura County Criminal Defense Lawyers Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And by all accounts, Clayman's deputies must handle a bigger caseload and work 
under far more pressure than their predecessors did under former Public 
Defender Richard Erwin. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney George C. Eskin has watched the public defender's office 
operate under both administrators. Eskin, who has served as assistant district 
attorney in Santa Barbara County and chief assistant city attorney in Los 
Angeles, was an assistant to Ventura County Dist. Atty. Woodruff Deem from 1967 
to 1970, while Erwin was public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Eskin praised both men as hard-working, competent public defenders, but he said 
Clayman and his deputies must work much harder. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's policy against plea bargaining, 
instituted soon after he took office in 1978, has forced the public defender to 
take more cases to trial. While defendants often are able to negotiate guilty 
pleas to lesser charges in Los Angeles County courts, Eskin said, defendants in 
Ventura County often have two choices: plead guilty as charged or go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman said that 5% to 7% of criminal cases go to trial in California, but 12% 
to 15% go to trial in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes a client is best served by pleading guilty, Clayman said. "The 
judges like to demonstrate . . . that if you go to trial and lose, you're going 
to do worse than if you plead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No records are kept on the success rate of the public defender's office. But to 
Clayman, victory comes when one of his deputies is able to persuade a jury to 
convict a client of a lesser charge. He cited the case of Peter Michael Bergne, 
who was convicted of second-degree murder and acquitted of first-degree murder 
and rape in the strangulation death of Linda Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes the public defender's office wins a trial, as in the 1989 case of 
a Vietnamese client in his 50s who was defended by Deputy Public Defender 
Alison Ayers. The man's car failed to stop at a stop sign and plowed into 
another driver, killing him. Ayers said her investigators were able to prove 
that the car's brakes failed and win an acquittal on a vehicular manslaughter 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman graduated from UCLA Law School in 1966 and worked 11 months on medical 
malpractice cases at the Los Angeles law firm of Leo Gelfand after passing the 
bar exam in 1967. But yearning to handle trials, he applied for a job in the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"That night when I went home, I couldn't sleep all night," Clayman said. "I 
realized I could not be a D.A. My heart was on the other side of the rules of 
evidence, of illegal search and seizure." 
</P>
<P>
So he joined the public defender's office in Los Angeles, where "training was 
anathema," Clayman said. "The only way we got training was they'd throw us into 
the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Clayman's former colleagues remember him as affable, hard-working, and a little 
tentative: 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was like all lawyers," said Charles R. English, now a Santa Monica 
defense attorney. "When you start, you second-guess all your decisions, and I 
think the biggest thing that's matured in Ken over 20 years is he's more 
comfortable in his decisions." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, a troublesome client made Clayman realize why he chose to be 
a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
"To say he gave me grief is an understatement," Clayman said. The man was 
"spitting on me, grabbing my tie and trying to choke me out. He cursed me with 
every word in the book, he ran out on me, he tried to fire me constantly. You 
know, that thing that everybody says: 'I don't want a public defender, I want a 
real lawyer.' 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I realized . . . that this was exactly the kind of client who 
needed me most." 
</P>
<P>
And Clayman remembers visiting the defendant in jail every Saturday morning 
until he finally earned the man's trust and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman rose through the ranks in the public defender's office in Los Angeles, 
spending nine years defending juveniles. In 1975, he became assistant chief of 
the juvenile division, then chief in 1977. In 1981, he was appointed chief of 
the misdemeanor division. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1984, Ventura County supervisors Dougherty and Susan K. Lacey 
nominated Clayman from among dozens of candidates to become public defender, a 
job that now pays $94,260 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman had to fill a huge pair of shoes. Erwin, Ventura County's first public 
defender, had held the post since 1966. Erwin was both respected and criticized 
by the district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Erwin was a flamboyant semi-showman . . . charismatic to the point of 
using the country boy image a lot to cover up the fine legal mind that he had," 
Sheriff John V. Gillespie said. Erwin "had a reputation for getting in the 
district attorney's face," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Clayman is more of the kind of person who can work things out in 
negotiation," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury remembers Erwin as a friend, but "kind of bombastic." The two often 
quarreled publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman airs his differences quietly in closed-door meetings and has "brought 
the office into the 20th Century," Bradbury said. Under Clayman, deputy public 
defenders have become more professional and are better trained, making the 
public defender's office "a much more formidable opponent in court," Bradbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Erwin "basically defined what the public defender was," said Lacey. "So when 
the choice came and we were able to review the three finalists, we needed an 
extremely strong person who could walk in and realize he or she was following a 
legend, and yet create a climate he could work in." 
</P>
<P>
While most officials admire Clayman's personal style, many do not always see 
eye-to-eye with him. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said he disagreed with Clayman's proposal to tighten rules governing 
conference rooms in the main jail after a sheriff's deputy overheard a 
conversation in April between a public defender and murder suspect Gregory 
Scott Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes think the defendants are overly defended," Gillespie said. "I 
would much prefer over-prosecution, but that's typical cop talk." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury observed that he and Clayman have a similar philosophy -- that their 
deputies should be tough. "We're here to see that justice is done, and it takes 
both of us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But Clayman has a ready sense of humor, particularly about the work to which 
the Perry Mason character helped drive him years ago. "I'm still waiting, after 
23 years in the practice, for somebody to stand up in the back of the room and 
say, 'I did it!' "
