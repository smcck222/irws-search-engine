 -- A flag carried aboard the space shuttle Challenger by New Hampshire teacher 
Sharon Christa McAuliffe went on display publicly for the first time at a 
conference of educators in Charleston, W. Va. The Flag of Liberty and Learning 
was recovered after the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing McAuliffe 
and six fellow crew members. State Schools Supt. Henry Marockie said educators 
nationwide still quote McAuliffe's words before the doomed flight: "I touch the 
future. I am a teacher." Marockie said the flag symbolizes America's reliance 
on education. Visitors may view it, along with a plaque from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, plus photographs of the Challenger crew, 
when the education conference ends. Later, it will travel to the other 49 
states.

 -- It has been host to everyone from royalty to war heroes to all manner of 
celebrities, and London's Savoy hotel celebrated its 100th birthday a little 
less snobbish but no less swank. Queen Elizabeth II first danced with Prince 
Philip there, when she was a princess. Another who graced the ballroom floor 
was Anna Pavlova. Winston Churchill held War Cabinet meetings there, and Gen. 
Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the hotel his linen from the battle front. Johann 
Strauss conducted waltzes in its restaurant, and impressionist Claude Monet 
painted views of the Thames from his suite. Today, said Stanley Jackson, author 
of a book on the hotel, "you've got your dukes and your Sinatras, and they seem 
to mix very well." Not that the hotel is for everyone. The Savoy has a staff of 
650 to cater to 300 guests; each of the eight floors has its own kitchen; every 
room -- all of them different -- has call buttons marked waiter, valet and 
maid; the mattresses are custom-made; the sheets and towels are pure linen. But 
the prices are between $244 and $832 a night.

Hyannis Port, Mass. Among the other Kennedys were Rhode Island state Rep. 
Patrick Kennedy, Ethel Kennedy, Eunice Shriver and Rep. Joseph Kennedy

Photo, March by Krishnas Hand-drawn chariots, cymbals and conga drums marked a 
march by 2,000 Hare Krishnas along Ocean Front Walk from Santa Monica to Venice 
beach Sunday. The event had two motives -- one to protest a $9.7-million court 
judgment which members say threatens the movement, the other to welcome 100 
Hare Krishnas on a walk from San Francisco to Tijuana. Police said the march 
attracted 20,000, drawn by the spectacle of the chariots and costumed marchers 
and by free food. Music and entertainment, staged at the Venice Pavilion, were 
part of the festivities. Authorities said the event was peaceful. MEL MELCON /

<TEXT>
<P>
Within weeks of moving to Los Angeles I realized that there are only two rules 
that govern traffic flow on the streets here: 
</P>
<P>
1. Red lights and green lights are optional. 
</P>
<P>
2. Yellow means speed up. 
</P>
<P>
Anarchy reigns on the streets of Los Angeles and Frankel was absolutely right 
to question our ability to comply with the more invasive forms of regulations 
on the horizon. Traffic and police authorities should heed well his call for 
enforcement of existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
But as individual drivers we must also make a commitment to obey these laws, no 
matter how much it hurts our pride and our drive time.

ART FUNDING CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial missed the point. Supporters of the exhibits causing the 
congressional actions and your editorial use an argument based on "free 
speech." A lady representing the museum used the same thesis in a recent debate 
on KCET on this subject. The congressman in that debate properly defended 
Congress with the statement that Congress controls the expenditures for the 
program and has the right to make the rules. The right of members of Congress 
to grant the funds also gives them the right to make and enforce the rules to 
be followed by the recipient(s) of those funds. 
</P>
<P>
Artists who are entitled to freedom of expression and who don't want to be told 
that government funds do not support their particular expressions and works of 
a certain nature are not being denied the freedom of expression -- they are 
only being denied government funds for work that is not approved by the 
government. They still have the right of free expression to sell their work to 
some other buyer with private funds. In other words, go sell your work 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Don't confuse the issues -- this is not an issue of the rights of artists to 
produce their conceptions of their feelings -- this is a case of wanting the 
government to give them money with no strings attached.

RUNNING RED LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Frankel misses one very important point in his column discussing Southern 
Californians' habit of ignoring red lights ("Better Red Than Dead on L.A. 
Streets," Op-Ed Page, July 28). Most drivers don't think of themselves as 
running red lights but rather running yellow lights. To them there's a big 
difference. A red light still holds the stigma of breaking the law. But a 
yellow light -- nah, that's just beating the odds. 
</P>
<P>
As one who views every yellow light as green, I would like to explain why. 
Lights on main thoroughfares are not synchronized. If you manage to get through 
one yellow light it could mean a dozen greens ahead of you. On the other hand, 
if you stop at a yellow, you will probably hit a red light for the next 10 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from the mean streets of Manhattan 12 years ago, I must say that little 
of the courtesy Southern California drivers were known for remains 
recognizable. Whatever is good for the driver goes -- even if that means 
possibly causing a major accident or killing a pedestrian. Again, as one who 
considers yellow lights nothing more than pale greens, I wish it were 
different. But unfortunately it won't be until the lights on major 
thoroughfares are synchronized and freeways are actually free.

HELMET BILL VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud Gov. Deukmejian's veto of the mandatory motorcycle helmet bill. The 
proposed helmet law embraces the philosophy that it is better to force the 
judgment of the majority on the individual than to grant that person the 
freedom, dignity, and occasional mistakes that all come as a package deal with 
being truly human. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, as long as the state reserves the right, at its own discretion, to 
draft a man and send him off to end up face down in a rice paddy somewhere with 
his brains blown out, it has no business telling him he must wear a helmet when 
he rides because otherwise he might get hurt.

News Item, July 27, 1989: The mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., a reformer who had 
been swept into office on the heels of political corruption, was arrested for 
bribery, conspiracy and official misconduct. Twelve other city officials were 
also arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlantic City? Remember when we drove there in an ice storm?" 
</P>
<P>
"No . . . yes. Pass the oranges, hon." 
</P>
<P>
"Who runs the place if they jail the mayor and his cronies?" 
</P>
<P>
"Pass the jam. New Jersey? You must be kidding. Some other bums. They're all 
corrupt. I'm gone. Is the traffic moving on the San Diego?" 
</P>
<P>
News Item: July 27, 1989: A Los Angeles City Council committee hears testimony 
about an attempt to cover up facts surrounding a deposit of tax funds in a bank 
that paid consultant fees to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
As the '80s stumble to a close, cynicism overwhelms indignation. Isn't private 
gain the name of the game throughout the land? Friends of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development are leaders in what everyone seems to be doing: 
trading contacts and information for bucks. They make some calls, send a few 
letters -- and line their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The former Florida Republican Party chairman helps steer a HUD low-income 
rental project to Lufkin, Tex. Hard work, as he testified, since the HUD 
headquarters is a "big building" and he "spent hours walking the halls." How 
many hours exactly did he spend? One hundred, but not without compensation. In 
fact, he bettered the minimum wage -- getting about $400,000, or $4,000 an 
hour. This work did not divert him from his commitment to the homeless of 
Jacksonville, Fla., which earned him another $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to benefit from these dealings -- at least everyone in 
government. For city officials, alas, the gains are usually smaller, since the 
spigots are narrower. Yet the figures bandied about Mayor Bradley seem 
embarrassingly small. For $18,000 did our mayor really help direct city funds 
to one bank? Surely a major metropolis like Los Angeles could do better. Where 
are the HUD or Pentagon connections? Why should a Jacksonville, Fla., homeless 
"consultant" humiliate Los Angeles officials? 
</P>
<P>
We re-enter the world of that Baltimore iconoclast, H.L. Mencken; perhaps we 
never left it. Mencken observed that Americans still insanely assumed that some 
politicians were superior to others. "What is any political campaign save a 
concerted effort to turn out a set of politicians who are admittedly bad and 
put in a set who are thought to be better? The former assumption, I believe, is 
always sound; the latter is just as certainly false . . . A good politician, 
under democracy, is quite as unthinkable as an honest burglar." Politicians, 
concluded Mencken, simply bilk taxpayers; they only seek to augment their 
compensation to "all the traffic will bear." 
</P>
<P>
We need Mencken today; he would have loved fat-cat homeless consultants and 
jailed Atlantic City mayors (of the last six, four were arrested). Mencken 
would have savored the spectacle of corrupt politicians swearing fealty to the 
commonweal. Dissolute wheelers and dealers outraged at insults to the flag. He 
would have enjoyed the tale of treasurers whiting-out documents; auditors who 
cannot audit; investment officials pointing fingers. 
</P>
<P>
But wasn't California supposed to be different, at least in myth? Wasn't this 
the difference between Los Angeles and Atlantic City or Jersey City or Chicago? 
The climate was milder, the land richer and the people friendlier and more 
honest. In the 19th Century, visitors and settlers to California promoted a 
vision of a better world; books like "California for Health, Pleasure and 
Residence" (1872) by the New York journalist Charles Nordhoff and "Happy Days 
in Southern California" (1898) by the Boston businessman Frederick Rindge 
extolled a new and sweeter civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was a myth. Los Angeles was as mean and violent as any American 
city. It still holds its own in poverty, racism and gangs. It is a world 
capital of cranks and hucksters. Yet myths have lives of their own. If only a 
myth distinguishes Los Angeles from Chicago or New York, this is something; the 
myth sustains lives and hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley entered politics as a reformer pitted against the old guard, Sam Yorty. 
"In Los Angeles today," Bradley stated in his 1969 mayoral campaign, " 
'commissioner' has too often meant corruption. Briefings on zonings or harbors 
have too often meant bribery. And civil servant has come to mean conflict of 
interest." In Los Angeles today, these words still ring true. Of course, 20 
years do not kill the myth of Southern California -- the orange groves, sun, 
mountains, the sea, a better life -- but surely the vision is harder to grasp. 
More than ever, pollution, violence and the seediness of local politics edge 
Los Angeles into the mainstream of American life; that's no place to be.

Six years ago, Nissan introduced worker participation into its management 
concept at Smyrna, Tenn. It took a risk that paid off in the election July 27 
when Nissan workers voted 1,622 to 711 against joining the United Auto Workers 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow the image of American auto workers in cowboy boots and jeans, waving 
Old Glory while wearing red-and-white T-shirts with "Nissan" boldly printed on 
the front, carrying anti-union signs seems paradoxical. 
</P>
<P>
Less than seven years ago, Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American engineer, was 
brutally beaten to death with a baseball bat by a frustrated, out-of-work 
Chrysler supervisor and his stepson in Detroit. They blamed Chin's supposed 
Japanese countrymen for unemployment in the American auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to anti-union management consultants who would herald the vote as 
proof that the labor movement is already down for the count, the union election 
should serve as a signal to American industry 
</P>
<P>
and organized labor that the U.S. worker will evaluate his options and choose 
the path that seems most likely to serve his self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
In Smyrna, Nissan wages and benefits were perceived as comparable to the union 
package. The union however, focused unsuccessfully on job-related injury 
problems and speed-ups to gather its campaign momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-union forces would argue that six years is plenty of time for Nissan to 
brainwash and intimidate workers with little union experience and who live in a 
right-to-work state. However, unions have been unable to win representation 
elections in any contested Japanese-owned auto plant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The task for the union is to re-examine the concerns and desires of the U.S. 
workers in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Can American unions win union certification elections by trumpeting the same 
old call that the company is the enemy and the union the friend of the working 
class? 
</P>
<P>
Can U.S. industry compete with foreign corporations while maintaining the same 
old adversarial relationship with their employees and their unions? 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for Nissan is to sustain the loyalty of their employees within 
the parameters of the team concept, and to address the concern about on-the-job 
injuries and speed-ups that more than one-third of their employees were looking 
to the union to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Can Nissan at Smyrna continue to hold the support of its workers in the future 
without being expected to steer a course even further in the direction of 
power-sharing? 
</P>
<P>
The UAW received more than one-third of the votes, and sent a strong message to 
the company that a sizable group of workers are looking for help. The union 
will most assuredly be regrouping to seize the moment when they sense that 
disenchantment with the system is beginning to take root. 
</P>
<P>
The team concept is a double-edged sword. Although some workers and their 
unions have been willing to offer the company more needed flexibility to 
operate its plant, what they demand in return is more power-sharing regarding 
operations and management. 
</P>
<P>
This domestic perestroika can lead to a much-improved level of quality and 
productivity, job satisfaction and security, and a better labor-management 
relationship. But the course must be pursued with skill, sincerity and genuine 
power-sharing. Disillusionment, bitterness and a return to adversarial 
relationships is inevitable if one side sees it as simply the most advanced 
form of weaponry in the age-old power struggle between labor and management. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan can expect more tests of its team concept. Once you begin to dance with 
the bear, you dare not stop the music.

The U.S. Senate's vote on July 26 to bar federal support of "obscene or 
indecent" artwork is the most serious and radical assault on freedom of 
expression to occur in this country since the days of Joe McCarthy and 
"blacklists." Worse, the measure sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) is part 
of an accelerating pattern of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
This action is the culmination of a plague that has moved from the mosques of 
Tehran to the very temple of democracy. It stems from a sensibility that wants 
to deny and destroy anything that it finds offensive or disagreeable. 
</P>
<P>
Helms' insidious proposal would bar the National Endowment for the Arts from 
making grants to organizations that support artwork found offensive by some 
people. That makes the senator a spiritual blood brother of the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini. The ayatollah's death threats against Salman Rushdie differ 
only in degree from Helms' desire to deny federal funds to Robert Mapplethorpe 
or Andres Serrano, both are the acts of self-appointed censors. 
</P>
<P>
We can understand that sometimes some people may find a particular work of art 
offensive. Yet there is a great difference between criticizing a work as 
reprehensible and censoring it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the serious themes explored and profound statements intended by the 
artists, there may not exist a mass audience for homoerotic and sadomasochistic 
images or crucifixes dipped in urine (Serrano's work titled "Piss Christ"). 
Nevertheless, artists must have the opportunity to experiment and create. 
</P>
<P>
Without an atmosphere of tolerance, the artistic imagination is forced 
underground. Those societies that have absolutely no tolerance for expressions 
outside the narrow bounds of a particular ideology pay for their lack of 
dialogue. The result in such intolerant societies: disappearances, gulags and 
massacres in public squares. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action is particularly shocking on two counts. It gives the 
Senate's imprimatur to censorship, thus encouraging those who wish to ban or 
censor art in any form. Also, only two senators, Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) 
and John H. Chaffee (R-R.I.), had the courage to speak against Helms' 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The disregard for freedom of expression has even infected those who should know 
better. In the last few months alone the following attacks against artistic 
freedom have occurred: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In an episode of CBS-TV's "Designing Women," one of the program's star 
characters crashes her car repeatedly into a newsstand because it sells 
pornographic magazines; the show's writers portray her as a heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Civil-rights activists demand that a UCLA-funded film with an anti-Mexican 
theme including bestiality be censored for being racist and sexist. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joseph Papp's Public Theater in New York cancels a scheduled production by 
the El-Hakawati Palestinian Theater Company. Under pressure, Papp agrees to 
present it next year, but only in conjunction with an Israeli play. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that whether in literature, the visual arts or any other art form, 
freedom of expression is essential. We, too, are always offended by racism and 
often offended by pornography. However, to diminish freedom for some is to 
diminish it for all. No nation that denies to its artists freedom of expression 
can ever hope to nurture great art, which is to say, great ideas compellingly 
(often provocatively) expressed. Failure to adhere to this standard -- however 
offensive its products may sometimes be -- guarantees the banality and ultimate 
demise of the nation and the culture that sustains it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is the nature of great art to risk intellectual and emotional 
provocation. Such risks are understood and valued by informed opinion, such as 
that institutionalized in the NEA's peer-review process. For more than 20 
years, this procedure has served our nation and its artists with distinction. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, taxpayers' money does fund the art. But we must keep in mind that, as 
a mature nation, we have reached a general consensus to nurture and cultivate 
the arts. Rather than dictate the nature of the artwork, we should allow our 
artists total freedom to create. 
</P>
<P>
We also recognize that no system is beyond improvement. However, to tamper with 
the essential autonomy of the National Endowment for the Arts as the Senate has 
done is to undermine the cornerstone of American democracy -- the First 
Amendment of our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The measure approved by the Senate now moves to a Senate-House conference 
committee where a final bill will be framed. We urge the conferees to ponder 
these words from the charter of PEN, the international writers organization: 
</P>
<P>
"In all circumstances . . . works of art and libraries, the patrimony of 
humanity at large, should be left untouched by national or political passion. 
The PEN stands for the principle of unhampered transmission of thought within 
each nation and between all nations, and members pledge themselves to oppose 
any form of suppression of freedom of expression in the country and community 
to which they belong."

Crown Oklahoma by Jim Lehrer (Putnam: $18.95; 223 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who watch the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" are used to taking the news 
of the day seriously. If we didn't, we wouldn't watch the "MacNeil/Lehrer 
NewsHour!" It's strange, in this world, that while we often can't take the 
President seriously, or political campaigns, or yet another set of murders more 
gross than the last, or the Middle East, or NATO, or the Stealth, seriously, 
still, the news itself, and the concept of the news, remains, at some level, 
absolutely sacred. (No one has ever said out loud, for instance, that Ted 
Koppel looks supremely silly. No one would dare, because he is Ted Koppel.) 
</P>
<P>
And so, if the "News" is to be spoofed (not "exposed" -- that would be 
permissible, because the expose-thrust is serious to the hilt), it must be from 
the inside. Jim Lehrer has taken the whole solemn concept of the news, and 
tickled it, poked it in the ribs, jabbed and punched it into giggling 
submission. "Crown Oklahoma" is a darling book, and Jim Lehrer, under his 
preoccupied frown of the White Protestant news-mogul must be a terminally Big 
Silly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweet Underachiever 
</P>
<P>
"Crown Oklahoma" marks the return of One-Eyed Mack, a sweet underachiever who 
has found his perfect vocation in being the lieutenant governor of Oklahoma, a 
job that pays about $9,000 a year, but also earns Mack prominent recognition at 
openings of mini-malls and the like. (Mack's wife, Jackie, is opening a string 
of drive-through convenience stores called Jackie-Marts, and Mack is her 
strenuous supporter.) Mack also has a son who's struggling with a baseball 
obsession: He loves the game, but plays so poorly in the city's intramural 
leagues that he's earned the unloved but appropriate moniker, Trash. 
</P>
<P>
But personal life is as nothing in the ongoing news, as Mack finds out one 
sultry summer night. His ongoing assignment for the state of Oklahoma is to 
watch the nightly news to see if his home state is mentioned: "It was July and 
Walter Cronkite was gone. The sound of ticker machines came up and a deep man's 
voice said, 'This is the CBS Evening News with Roger Mudd substituting for the 
vacationing Walter Cronkite.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor in a Snit 
</P>
<P>
The substituting Roger Mudd, on this particular night, chooses a hideously 
disconcerting lead story, read by a particularly unattractive reporter. A 
certain Archibald Tyler claims to have uncovered a "new Mafia" in the 
"hard-line narcotics trade." This mob, led by a man named Boomer, is allegedly 
based in Oklahoma, which throws Mack, his wife, his son, the governor (whose 
sole obsession in life is to stick a dome on the state Capitol, and thus to 
"crown Oklahoma") into a conniption. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, this news can't be true! And, of course, it isn't. Archibald Tyler has 
made it all up in a fit of pique. (This tradition goes back in time to Mark 
Twain making up the news in the Western town of Virginia City, because it was 
too cold to go outside, and has been recently revisited by David Freeman in the 
film "Street Smart.") But, just because this plot has been run through before 
takes nothing away, either from its relevance or its charm. 
</P>
<P>
This murky state of affairs takes all of Mack's wit and intelligence, as well 
as bushels of help from a loyal cadre of his Oklahoma family and friends to 
stop the berserk Archibald Tyler. False news, once announced, must somehow be 
made into reality, so that it can be exorcised. This eternal problem, though 
hilariously dealt with here, is both serious and criminal. Any nitwit in a 
tweed jacket and nice tie can make up anything at all. Once he's reported it, 
that's it; it's true, people believe it, live it, die from it. 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer's look at journalism's cardinal sin is both traditional and fresh as a 
penny. I hate to say it, but I have to: In his hands, "Everything old is news 
again."

A small plane whose pilot was spotting schools of fish for a fishing boat 
crashed into the Pacific off the Orange County coast, prompting a search by the 
Coast Guard and Navy for the flier, authorities said. Searchers found a 
sneaker, a flight plan, an aerosol can and pieces of the aircraft, but no sign 
of the pilot, Joseph A. Shirley, 42, of Del Mar, several hours after the plane 
nose-dived into the ocean 10 miles southwest of Dana Point. Coast Guard 
spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely said crews aboard a Coast Guard cutter and patrol 
boat and two Navy vessels searched for the pilot of the Cessna 172 until 
nightfall. The plane is believed to have taken off from Gillespie Field near El 
Cajon in San Diego County, Neely said. Shirley was working with the commercial 
fishing vessel Horizon, spotting schools of fish.

Two top-of-the-line Soviet fighters accompanied by the world's largest aircraft 
made a historic stop at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, en route to a 
"sales mission" in Canada. It was the first time that MIG-29 fighters and the 
Soviet An-225 transport had landed on the North American continent. "These are 
showroom models," said Maj. Doug McCoy, an Elmendorf spokesman who was 
referring to the pair of stripped-down MIG-29s. After a refueling stop in 
Alaska they were to be escorted to the Canadian border by U.S. Air Force F-15 
Eagles.

Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been confirmed as the Islamic spiritual 
successor to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was the nation's supreme 
leader, the official Islamic Republic New Agency reported. IRNA said the 
83-member Assembly of Experts -- a group of Iranian jurists and clerics -- 
reaffirmed its vote taken June 4 -- the day after Khomeini's death -- that had 
provisionally elected Khamenei, 50, to the post in accordance with Khomeini's 
wishes.

URBAN LEAGUE DECLARES WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Urban League, one of the largest and most influential 
organizations concerned with the problems of black America, announced it would 
launch a no-holds-barred effort to wipe out drug trafficking in the 113 
communities across America where the league has affiliate chapters. League 
President John E. Jacob said: "It's not a black problem. It's not a white 
problem. Drugs are a national problem, and if the nation isn't willing to wage 
war against it, we'll have to ourselves." Jacob spelled out some of the 
measures that Urban League affiliates would seek to engage in: creating 
information networks with other local organizations to compile name lists of 
known and suspected traffickers; cooperating with criminal justice authorities 
in sting operations and photographing out-of-neighborhood drug users' cars when 
they enter a community to buy drugs.

LAWYER WANTS CLIENT ON COKE

The lawyer for Ramon Salcido, charged with killing three members of his family 
and three others in an April 14 rampage in Northern California wine country, 
says he wants to prove his client has a brain disorder by giving him cocaine. 
"I want to get him intoxicated with some cocaine and see what the connection 
is," said Deputy Public Defender Marteen Miller, who believes Salcido used 
cocaine and alcohol on the day of the killing rampage. Miller said preliminary 
tests indicate Salcido may have a history of seizures and trauma that could 
explain the crimes. The attorney said he will ask a judge to transfer Salcido 
from the Sonoma County Jail to Orange County, where more neurological tests can 
be performed. Dr. Monte Buchsbam of UC Irvine, who would perform the tests, 
said they may tell whether Salcido is a schizophrenic, a manic-depressive or a 
sufferer of some other mental illness, but said drugging Salcido with cocaine 
might not prove much.

The cost of operating prisons in California is expected to increase, costing $4 
billion annually by 1994. That is more than double the current bill, according 
to prison officials. In addition, taxpayers can expect to spend $3.5 billion to 
build new prisons in the next five years. Corrections Director James Rowland 
said that the costs stem from projections that the state will have 136,000 
people in prison by 1994, compared to 82,800 locked up now. The state currently 
spends about $1.8 billion annually to run its prisons.

Two Lebanese girls drowned after Syrian rocket fire capsized a boat packed with 
refugees fleeing Lebanon's civil war. The boat was ferrying passengers from the 
besieged Christian port of Juniyah to a Hovercraft bound for Cyprus when a 
Syrian rocket battery opened fire. Crew members from the Hovercraft lowered 
life rafts and picked up six passengers, while eight others were rescued by a 
fishing boat. In Beirut, three people were killed and 18 wounded in duels 
between Syrian and Christian forces and in clashes across the capital's 
dividing Green Line.

Showers and thunderstorms soaked much of the nation Sunday, as fierce winds 
whipped parts of Kentucky and New York and thousands of West Virginians were 
left without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms packing 65-m.p.h. winds and torrential rain also plowed across 
northern and western Texas.

<P>
Dallas was hit by a storm that inundated low-lying parts of the city with 
floodwaters, choking highway underpasses. Water on Interstate 35 was 3 feet 
deep.

<P>
Winds at 65 m.p.h. in Collin County, northeast of Dallas, ripped down tree 
limbs and damaged at least one outbuilding, the National Weather Service 
reported. 
</P>

The thunderstorms produced small hail, damaging trees and power lines near 
Hopkinsville, Ky. There also was damage from thunderstorm wind gusts at Dundee, 
N.Y.

A small plane whose pilot was spotting schools of fish for a fishing boat

Searchers found a sneaker, a flight plan, an aerosol can and pieces of the

Coast Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely said crews aboard a Coast Guard cutter

until nightfall. His name was withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
"The water in that area is pretty deep," she said. "It's at least 200 to 400 
fathoms," about 800 feet to 1,600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is believed to have taken off from Gillespie Field near El Cajon in 
San Diego County sometime Sunday morning, Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot was working with the commercial fishing vessel Horizon, spotting 
schools of fish and reporting by radio their position to the boat, whose owner

</P>
<P>
"There was no fire and no smoke" coming from the falling plane, Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was believed the pilot was alone in the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
A Federal Aviation Administration duty officer said the pilot did not report 
having difficulties, and there was no immediate information on what caused the 
crash.

A decision is expected early this week on adding a third date to the Rolling 
Stones concerts in Los Angeles in October. Fans bought up tickets for the 
band's Oct. 21 "Steel Wheels" show at the Coliseum in just over an hour 
Saturday, and a second performance (on Oct. 22) sold out nearly as fast. A 
source close to the tour said Sunday that a third date is under consideration. 
Capacity is figured at 72,000 per show. Tickets, costing $36 each, were limited 
to eight per person. This is the first Stones tour in more than eight years. 
The concerts also feature Guns N' Roses and Living Colour. Los Angeles wasn't 
the only place where Rolling Stones tickets were gathering no moss Saturday. In 
Philadelphia, some 100,000 tickets for Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 "Steel Wheels" shows 
went on sale there at 10 a.m. and were gone by 12:45 p.m. ALEENE MacMINN

Cashing in on the megabucks hysteria of "Batman," Bob Kane, the artist who 
created the "Batman" characters for D.C. Comics back in 1938, has signed a 
development deal with Nelvana Productions for his latest comic book creation, 
"Negative Man." The character will be part of a live-action television series 
that Nelvana hopes to put into production next year. Nelvana, which produced 
the recently released "Babar" movie, also is working on several animated 
programs based on some of Kane's other superhero creations. ALEENE MacMINN

LATIN PRESIDENTS AGREE ON DISBANDING CONTRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TELA, Honduras 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presidents of five Central American countries, ignoring direct appeals from 
President Bush to go slow, agreed in principle Sunday to start dismantling the 
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel army within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidents have reached a consensus that this plan should go forward right 
away," President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said during a break in the talks in 
this Caribbean banana port. 
</P>
<P>
Other presidents withheld comment and kept meeting to complete details of an 
updated regional peace accord, but senior Costa Rican and Salvadoran aides 
confirmed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Start to Disarmament 
</P>
<P>
John Biehl, a close adviser to President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, 
said the process of disarming Nicaraguan rebel troops would start "almost 
immediately," as soon as a commission is set up by the United Nations and the 
Organization of American States and dispatched to the Contra bases in Honduras 
to supervise the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The disarmed rebels would be repatriated to Nicaragua if they wished or 
relocated in third countries. How long this process would take is still under 
discussion, Biehl said, but the issue is expected to be settled before today's 
scheduled conclusion of the three-day summit. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement, if signed today, would apparently defeat a White House 
effort to keep the idled, 11,000-member Contra army intact in its bases until 
after Ortega's Sandinista government holds national elections next Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
It would also bring pressure on the U.S. Congress to divert what is left of the 
Contras' current $47.9 million non-lethal aid package to the exclusive purpose 
of assisting their return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
Bush telephoned Arias and presidents Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Vinicio 
Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras last week to press 
his view that a large Contra army is the only way to hold Ortega to his promise 
that the election will be fair. 
</P>
<P>
But some Central American officials said that Bush's publicized appeal was 
probably aimed more at soothing his right-wing critics at home than swaying his 
allies in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody here was convinced that Mr. Bush wants to continue supporting the 
Contras," one official said. "Everybody knows that the Contras are finished as 
a fighting force." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel bands began fighting in Nicaragua a year after the Sandinistas seized 
power in a 1979 guerrilla uprising. They have received U.S. aid and direction 
since late 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The movement has been steadily weakened by peace accords signed at three 
previous regional summits over the past two years. Most rebel troops withdrew 
to Honduras last year after their U.S. military aid was cut off and a 
cease-fire pact signed with the Sandinistas in March, 1988, broke down over the 
issue of democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Under the last summit accord, signed six months ago, the five presidents agreed 
to draft, at the current meeting, a plan for closing the Contra camps in 
exchange for free elections in Nicaragua nine months ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Gesture 
</P>
<P>
With that trade-off topping the agenda here, Ortega strengthened his hand with 
a dramatic gesture in Nicaragua on the eve of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
In an all-night session with 22 anti-Sandinista parties that was televised live 
in his country, he achieved a landmark agreement on political and electoral 
reforms to ensure a fair campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Among Ortega's concessions were a suspension of military conscription during 
the six-month campaign period, abolition of Sandinista police powers to conduct 
arbitrary arrests and summary trials, and a series of technical reforms making 
it easier for opposition parties to monitor the February vote. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition politicians in Nicaragua hailed the accord as a vindication of the 
Contra cause and urged Central American leaders to adopt a plan to dissolve the 
insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement reached in Nicaragua was absolutely decisive," Biehl said. "It 
cleared away 90% of the agenda here." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega arrived here Saturday and handed a copy of the 40-point agreement to 
Azcona, saying the electoral guarantees "remove all pretexts" for allowing 
armed Contras to remain on Honduran soil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for Deadline 
</P>
<P>
In the meeting here, Ortega pushed for a 90-day deadline for disarming the 
rebels and closing the camps. 
</P>
<P>
He won qualified support from Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for 
starting the regional peace process and who helped set up the negotiations that 
produced the election reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Arias said that dismantling the Contras should be gradual "but not conditional 
on the Nicaraguan elections." 
</P>
<P>
At first it appeared that Azcona and Cristiani might block the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Honduran leader said the electoral agreement in Nicaragua was "not enough." 
He offered his own plan for a lengthy inspection by international observers of 
political conditions in Nicaragua before disarmament could start. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan was largely abandoned, with Azcona's acquiescence, when other 
presidents failed to back it, Central American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impatient With Administration 
</P>
<P>
The United States has long depended on Honduras to carry U.S. views in Central 
America. But Azcona has become impatient over the Bush Administration's failure 
to come up with its own plan for getting the Contras out of his country, 
fearing that they will dissolve into uncontrolled armed bands. 
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to be uncertain whether Washington's withholding of $70 
million in promised economic aid was meant to force him to make an unpopular 
currency devaluation or to keep the Contras around -- either of which would 
damage his party's candidate in Honduras' scheduled November elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Azcona doesn't want to be remembered as the president who stuck Honduras with 
the Contras," an official of another Central American country said in 
explaining the unanimous backing for an early demobilization. 
</P>
<P>
Like Azcona, Arias will leave office early next year and was eager to see the 
Nicaraguan conflict settled by then. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani's new right-wing government in El Salvador, however, had threatened 
to complicate a peace accord by insisting that leftist guerrillas in his 
country be disbanded in tandem with the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
But other presidents rejected any linkage in resolving the two very different 
guerrilla conflicts. They were reported near an agreement to call for peace 
talks in El Salvador -- the first in nearly two years -- as an unrelated item 
of the final summit accord.

FOR ATLANTIC CITY, CASINO JACKPOT'S STILL A LONG SHOT 
</P>

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 38 years watching the boardwalk from a worn Persian carpet in "Madame 
Edith's Temple of Knowledge," Edith Stevens says she doesn't need her crystal 
ball or Tarot cards to read this city's future. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be changes here," she said, gold bracelets jangling on each arm. 
"This town can't get any worse." 
</P>
<P>
With the dramatic arrests last month of Mayor James L. Usry and 13 political 
associates on charges of bribery and corruption, one need not be psychic to see 
fortunes are fading for this famed seaside resort. Eleven years after the first 
casino opened, gambling has yet to pay off for Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city is the nation's top tourist draw -- 33.1 million visitors 
came last year -- seven of the 12 casinos lost money and one, the Atlantis, 
closed its doors forever. Casino revenues so far this year are flat. "I expect 
next year will be a disaster," said market analyst Marvin B. Roffman. "There 
probably will be a couple of casinos that will go under." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the casinos, the city is increasingly poor and black. There is still no 
movie theater or major supermarket. Population has plummeted. Violent crime has 
tripled. Public assistance rolls have doubled. Block after block still looks 
bombed out, with dilapidated row houses and boarded-up stores. Money magazine 
ranks it as the most unlivable city in America. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the ultimate in glitz and luxury in one small part of the city, and 
abject poverty everywhere else," said Albert A. Marks Jr., a civic leader and 
longtime director of the Miss America Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a decade of planning, a new convention center remains unbuilt. The 
"Atlantic City International Airport" has one dingy terminal and one commercial 
airline. And relations are so strained between city officials and the casinos 
that Thomas D. Carver, president of the Casino Assn. of New Jersey, the 
industry's chief trade group, likens it to war. 
</P>
<P>
"We are like the British Army in Belfast," said Carver. "We are not part of 
this community. We are like an occupying force." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, by all accounts, this city of 36,000 is so racially polarized that many 
casino executives, community leaders and state officials say they are helpless 
to act. Casinos, which pay 62% of the city's $110-million budget, are 
controlled mostly by whites. City Hall, which spends the money, is controlled 
mostly by blacks. The two sides rarely talk. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bitter racial division that affects everything," said Carl Zeitz, 
who left the New Jersey Casino Control Commission last December after eight 
years. "No matter what you say or do, no matter what your intention, it finally 
comes down to whether you're black or white. It's a sorry, sorry place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racial Tension 
</P>
<P>
The racial tension was clear after state police arrested Mayor Usry, City 
Council President Walter Collette, two city councilmen, the zoning board 
chairman and nine others early on July 27. Usry, 67, is the city's first black 
mayor and all but one of the eight other city officials are black. Their 
supporters angrily insist the real conspiracy is racism, not corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's an attempt to dismantle our black leadership," said Wilbert Huff 
Royal, a community leader who organized a three-hour "Save Our Black Community 
Rally" at St. James A.M.E. Church last Sunday. "It was a slap at blacks in 
general." 
</P>
<P>
John Whittington, a former city councilman, agrees. "They can't vote Usry out, 
so they're looking for any way to get him out," he said. "From the moment a 
black person assumes elected office, he immediately becomes a target." 
</P>
<P>
Usry denied the police charges in an emotional appeal to the packed pews. "I 
have not betrayed you, I will not betray you," he said. Court papers allege 
that Usry accepted $6,000 in cash from a police informant in exchange for 
support for an ordinance allowing electric carts on the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
State police deny race was a factor in the eight-month investigation. Citing 
more than 300 audio and video tapes, court papers allege that Albert Black, a 
portly private detective who worked undercover for police, paid $60,000 in 
bribes for zoning variances, rent control waivers, airport concessions, illegal 
campaign contributions and the electric cart rules. At least a dozen other 
arrests are likely, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sticky Problem 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens in court, political corruption is as sticky a tradition here 
as saltwater taffy. Back in 1910, supporters of Mayor Louis Kuehnle counted 
more votes than there were registered voters. His flamboyant protege, Mayor 
Enoch L. (Nucky) Johnson, ran rackets, brothels and gambling dens during 
Prohibition. He went to jail in 1941. So have three other mayors in the last 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlantic City was founded on corruption and speculation," explained City Clerk 
Benjamin Fitzgerald. "This is nothing new here." 
</P>
<P>
Usry, a former school principal and semi-pro basketball player, was first 
elected mayor in 1984, vowing to end patronage, payoffs and corruption. His 
plea had special appeal since, prosecutors charged, then-Mayor Michael J. 
Matthews had sold his office to the Mafia. Matthews later pleaded guilty to 
taking a $10,000 bribe and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Thomas H. Kean proudly embraced Usry to the Republican Party. He helped 
bankroll Usry's mayoral campaigns and introduced him at the 1984 Republican 
National Convention. Usry attended the 1988 convention as a delegate for George 
Bush. He was elected president of the National Conference of Black Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
But back home, critics say patronage is as endemic as ever, and decisions are 
forever delayed. A $250,000 audit of city government in 1986 by Touche Ross 
&amp; Co, paid for by the casino industry, cited case after case of over 
staffing, mismanagement and absenteeism. Although Usry initially agreed to the 
audit, most of the 150 recommendations were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewed Demands 
</P>
<P>
The arrests prompted renewed demands for state help, either by taking over 
local government, appointing a trustee or just hiring a trained city manager. 
State Sen. William L. Gormley, who represents the Atlantic City area, said this 
week he would start with "a cop watching the zoning board." So far, Gov. Kean 
has refused any intervention. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the state had hoped for far better. Twelve years ago, Atlantic City was 
at the end of a long postwar slide. Once grand hotels were crumbling, 
unemployment soared and middle-class residents fled. The "queen by the sea" was 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1977, state legislators specifically approved casino gambling to 
rebuild the city. The Casino Control Act called legalized gambling "a unique 
tool of urban redevelopment" and directed casinos to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
But no mechanism was established to collect or spend the money. It took the 
state eight years to create the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, and 
two more years for the agency to begin operating. In the meantime, feverish 
land speculation stifled development. Tax hikes of up to 600% forced older and 
poorer residents out of their homes. Conditions grew worse, not better. 
</P>
<P>
That has begun to change, insists CRDA director Noel Eisenstat. He said the 
agency has now helped to build 688 rental apartments and is beginning a 
10-year, half-billion-dollar project to build 3,000 new homes and apartments in 
the Northeast Inlet area. "It will be a totally new community in the most 
blighted area of the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finger-Pointing 
</P>
<P>
But that is in the future. For now, the finger-pointing is as fast as action on 
the craps tables. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Steven P. Perskie, chief sponsor of the original gambling 
law, defends the casinos. "By itself, gambling never could solve all the 
problems here," he said. "The goal was to provide the tool by which government 
could work on solutions. The casinos did their job: They made money and they 
paid taxes. The problem in the equation is the failure of government to use the 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders who popped open Champagne when the first casino opened in 1978 
say they misread how the city would be affected. John R. Siracusa Jr., former 
head of the city's Chamber of Commerce, thought the casinos would boost local 
business, bring conventions, lure investments and save the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we didn't read right was the gambler comes into town, parks his car, goes 
into the casino, has dinner there, shops there, is entertained there, then 
calls for his car and goes home," Siracusa said. "He leaves not one dime in the 
rest of Atlantic City. And the rest of the city has deteriorated." 
</P>
<P>
Not so the surrounding suburbs. More than four times as many casino workers 
live outside Atlantic City as within. Towns like Egg Harbor and Galloway, a 
short drive away, are thriving. Casino officials are quick to claim other 
statewide benefits: 70,000 direct and indirect jobs, $5 billion in investment, 
and almost $3.7 billion in federal, state and local taxes and fees, much of it 
dedicated to programs for the elderly and handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts warn rough times are ahead. Although casinos reported revenues 
last year of $2.7 billion, net profits fell 80% to $14.7 million. And Donald 
Trump plans to open his third casino, the $1-billion Taj Mahal, next spring. 
The vast, onion-domed gaming hall will add 20% more tables and slots overnight 
to an already saturated market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Slices 
</P>
<P>
"That means the pie stays the same, but the slices get smaller," said Al 
Glasgow, publisher of Atlantic City Action, an industry newsletter. "It's going 
to mean survival of the fittest." 
</P>
<P>
Carver, who heads the casino association, says the city still needs an economic 
game plan for the future. "There is no common vision of what Atlantic City is 
supposed to be," he said. "Is it going to be a year-round convention 
destination and resort community? Or an ugly city separate and apart from the 
casinos, which is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
For now, hundreds of buses clog the narrow streets, carrying low-income 
gamblers to the casinos. Tapped out gamblers snooze on sunny benches. At Park 
Place, famed from Monopoly boards, a rundown restaurant offers "All you can 
eat!" for $4.29. Several blocks away, children play in rubble-strewn lots. Most 
visitors are gone by sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlantic City used to be a dump," said Roffman, an industry analyst with 
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia. "Now it's a dump with casinos."

AIDS CARE: WHO'LL PICK UP THE BILL?

<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS researchers at the National Institutes of Health last week trumpeted some 
of the best news yet in their eight-year struggle against the killer syndrome: 
evidence that the drug AZT can delay the development of full-blown AIDS in 
people with early symptoms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Now come the hard economic realities. A full dose of AZT costs $8,000 a year, 
and federal officials estimate that up to 200,000 of this country's 1.5 million 
infected people need it. 
</P>
<P>
Other AIDS drugs have equally stratospheric prices: aerosolized pentamidine, 
including the cost of administration, can reach $3,000 a year. Analysts say 
high-tech drugs in the pipeline will fetch even more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue of Economics 
</P>
<P>
The costs of treatment now are beginning to catch up with medical advances. As 
scientists discover new ways to prolong the lives of people infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus, the national struggle against AIDS increasingly 
becomes an issue of economics -- and fiscal priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions grow more urgent with every biomedical advance," said Dr. Philip 
Lee, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UC San Francisco. 
"Who will pay? How much will it cost? Why does it have to cost so much?" 
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS activist movement has made great strides in streamlining the federal 
drug approval process," added Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS 
Action Council in Washington. "If we can extend those gains to reimbursement 
issues and drug pricing, we will have truly made a revolution." 
</P>
<P>
The estimated costs of a national program to medically monitor and treat those 
infected with HIV before they develop full-blown AIDS are staggering. The total 
annual bill could range from $2.5 billion to $10 billion, according to New York 
health economist Peter Arno in an article prepared for publication next month 
in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Concerns 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Medicare's kidney dialysis program for the nation's 110,000 
patients with end-stage renal disease is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion 
this year, according to the Health Care Financing Administration. But 
budget-conscious legislators are in no mood to create another disease-specific 
entitlement program. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Congress nor the Administration have included funding in next year's 
budget for a large-scale program for early intervention against the virus. 
Coverage for drugs by private health-care plans is spotty, and some are dodging 
costs by instituting caps or exclusions on reimbursements for AIDS and HIV 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
In February, for example, Commercial Sales and Service Trust of Los Angeles, 
whose policies provide a maximum lifetime benefit of $1 million, slapped a 
$10,000 cap on AIDS benefits, even for existing policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
"One year of AZT or a few days in the hospital would eat that up very quickly," 
said one frightened policyholder, a 37-year-old self-employed carpenter who 
tested positive for HIV three years ago and has been covered by the company for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
"As more and more insurance companies or employers start to redline, we will 
have created a class of people our society has never faced before: the employed 
uninsurables," said Timothy Westmoreland, counsel to the House subcommittee on 
health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about who will pay for new medical technology predated acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome and go far beyond it. In the 1970s, for example, 
private insurers and government health care programs were forced to decide 
whether, and under what circumstances, to pay for costly organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Society Benefits' 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, a survey of major health insurers found that 85% would reimburse for 
heart transplants but only 69% would pay for the costlier and riskier combined 
heart-lung transplant. Experts predict that the conflict between technological 
advancement and health-care cost containment will grow even more difficult to 
resolve in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of spending for early intervention against HIV make both humanitarian 
and economic arguments. "Society benefits by keeping these people healthy, 
active, employed and paying taxes," said Dr. David Rogers, elected last 
Thursday as deputy chairman of the new National Commission on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative to early intervention is to do nothing and wait until we have 
a lot of sick, dying and demented people," Rogers said. With total national 
health care spending of $550 billion annually, he added, "it is nonsense to say 
that we cannot afford it." 
</P>
<P>
"Early intervention dollars now will save an astronomical sum of money down the 
road in terms of future costs for hospitalization," added Rep. Nancy Pelosi 
(D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Still, the debate is pitting advocates of people with HIV disease against 
lobbyists seeking funds to combat cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. 
Some argue that AIDS research and education, budgeted at $1.31 billion for the 
current fiscal year, is already taking too large a slice of the federal health 
research pie. 
</P>
<P>
Comparable federal research allocations in fiscal 1989 were $1.45 billion for 
cancer, $1.01 billion for heart disease, $267 million for diabetes and $127 
million for Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Research Funds 
</P>
<P>
Besides the current competition for research funds, "down the line, you can 
imagine a competition between the elderly and AIDS patients for health-care 
dollars," said Anthony Pascal, a senior economist with the RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Within the National Institutes of Health, scientists fret that AIDS research 
dollars will be siphoned away to help pay for patient care. That is precisely 
what happened in March, when $7 million originally earmarked for research was 
diverted to a federal AZT program for people with AIDS. "It is a worrisome 
precedent," said one researcher, noting that the AZT funds are slated to run 
out again in September. 
</P>
<P>
Other participants in the emerging debate include the state and federal 
governments, private health insurers and pharmaceutical companies, who face 
serious pressures to roll back their prices of expensive AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that in order to pay for early intervention, we will need to piece 
together funding from a number of sources: Medicare, Medicaid, insurers and 
HMOs," said Steve Morin, an aide to Rep. Pelosi. "Participants will also have 
to pay a portion of the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Morin said cost estimates of a large-scale early intervention program remain 
highly speculative. "We haven't really tested the market yet. Demand is 
probably high in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, but early 
intervention is probably a foreign concept in much of the country," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"How many people will come in (for testing and treatment)?" Morin asked. "What 
will their needs be? What funding sources are already available?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Issues to Fore 
</P>
<P>
Government payments cover life-extending AIDS drugs in many states, including 
California through the Medi-Cal program. But such coverage requires that 
patients be impoverished to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere there is evidence that questions about funding are coming to the 
fore. Last month, for example, in its first foray outside of biomedical and 
behavioral research, the American Foundation for AIDS Research's board of 
directors earmarked $500,000 for studies of health-care financing and service 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the AIDS story is going," said David Corkery, the foundation's 
director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Health Insurance Assn. of America has established a task 
force of insurance company medical directors to consider reimbursing patients 
for experimental drugs for AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Most insurers currently do not reimburse patients for such drugs or for 
hospital stays associated with their use. In addition, some balk at paying for 
FDA-licensed drugs unless patients fit into precise criteria set forth by the 
agency or in medical literature. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and patient advocates argue that such restrictive reimbursement 
practices exact an inordinately heavy toll on people with AIDS and HIV because 
treatment advances are occurring more rapidly than can be reflected in the 
medical literature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caps Not Condoned 
</P>
<P>
Jude Payne, policy analyst for the Health Insurance Assn., said private 
insurance companies are treating HIV and AIDS the same way they are treating 
other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to be sensitive to the fact that New York and California are ahead 
of the rest of the country in defining standard medical practice for HIV," she 
said. In setting reimbursement policies, she added, the insurers must look at 
the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said the association, which represents 350 private insurers, does not 
condone exclusions or caps on payments for AIDS or HIV. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, according to California Department of Insurance attorney Peter Groom, 
such caps and exclusions generally crop up only in self-insured health care 
plans. Such plans, under which employers typically bear the financial risk, are 
beyond the reach of state insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"These exclusions are cruel and heartless," he said. "They dump people onto the 
public dole." Some civil rights attorneys contend that the exclusions would be 
outlawed if, as expected, Congress enacts legislation supported by the White 
House barring discrimination against disabled people, including those infected 
with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
However, the legislation would provide little relief against steadily rising 
insurance premiums. "I've seen situations where an employee with AIDS at a 
small company files his first claim and rates triple or quadruple for the rest 
of the company," said Benjamin Schatz, director of the AIDS Civil Rights 
Project of National Gay Rights Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
To hold costs -- and premiums -- down, some health-policy analysts believe 
Congress should consider ways to reduce prices of drugs for AIDS and other 
life-threatening conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Orphan Drug Act 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, they are urging changes in the Orphan Drug Act, which provides 
tax credits and a seven-year exclusive marketing license to companies that 
develop drugs for disorders affecting fewer than 200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Lee of UC San Francisco points to the price of pentamidine, which jumped from 
$24 a vial to $99.45 when its use became clear in preventing pneumocystis 
pneumonia, the most frequent killer of AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are going to treat HIV-positive individuals (instead of just people 
with AIDS), you've got a world market of 10 million people and a domestic 
market of 1 million," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
As the uses for an orphan drug widen, "you've got to ask, 'Can we lower the 
price with competition by re-examining the applicability of the Orphan Drug 
Act?' " Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
To promote price competition, the Public Citizen Health Research Group and the 
American Public Health Assn. have petitioned the government to issue multiple 
licenses for AIDS drugs developed at public expense. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the current system, the government is paying twice: the first time for 
the research and the second time for an outrageously priced drug through 
Medicare or Medicaid," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the health 
research group. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. John C. Petricciani, vice president for medical and regulatory affairs 
of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., warned that tinkering with the law 
could discourage drug makers from pursuing AIDS research. "Price controls," he 
said, "could have a chilling effect on the industry's willingness to take risks 
to develop new drugs."

MILITANTS OFFER SWAP OF CAPTIVES; 
</P>
<P>
WILL FREE CICIPPIO IF ISRAEL RELEASES CLERIC, 450 OTHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Muslim extremist group holding American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio in 
Lebanon declared Sunday evening that it would free him if Israel released a 
captive Shiite clergyman and 450 Arab prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The communique from the Revolutionary Justice Organization was the first 
proposal by Shiite kidnapers to trade one of their American hostages for Sheik 
Abdel Karim Obeid, a southern Lebanon leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah 
movement who was abducted from his village by Israeli commandos July 28. 
</P>
<P>
By offering freedom for an American hostage, the statement, handwritten in 
Arabic and delivered to a Beirut newspaper office, appeared couched to invite 
U.S. pressure on the Israeli government to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Attached to the statement was a color photograph of yet another American 
captive, Edward A. Tracy. Tracy, whose abduction was reported in October, 1986, 
was bearded and wearing a brown T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Alon Liel, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The 
Times that his government has received no word on negotiations from either 
Hezbollah or the kidnap groups and refused to respond to the welter of 
communiques being released in Beirut. Privately, another Foreign Ministry 
official said the Israelis are perplexed by the diversity of offers and 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's communique declared, without specifics: "Following the positive 
response and flexible stands, which were announced by the concerned parties 
regarding the initiative, and after the encouraging regional developments that 
promised happy endings to the hostage problem, the Revolutionary Justice 
Organization announces the operation stages of the initiative in return for the 
immediate release of Cicippio." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Release of 450 
</P>
<P>
It then demanded in return that the Israeli government permit the return of 
Palestinians deported from the occupied territories; the release of Obeid and 
150 other Lebanese it said are being held by the Israelis, and freedom for 300 
Palestinians jailed in Israel for participating in the intifada, the 
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"The names will be discussed upon the agreement of the other party," presumably 
Israel, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah statement released Saturday specified five Palestinians it wanted 
released along with Obeid, without offering a prisoner swap in return. The five 
included militants involved in terrorist incidents in Israel earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Justice group, believed to be a cell of the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah, singled out Syria, an ally of Iran, for playing a positive role in 
developments on the hostage crisis since the abduction of Obeid and declared: 
"We hope that the Syrian government will agree to negotiations through 
international organizations to make the initiative succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The communique concluded, "The organization points out that the success of this 
initiative could lead to dramatic developments ending the hostage problem." 
</P>
<P>
Previous demands from the kidnap groups threatened to kill the hostages if 
Obeid was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on 
Earth announced it had executed U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and 
turned over a videotape of a hanged man it said was the American officer. 
</P>
<P>
Later the same day, the Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened to kill 
Cicippio, a 58-year-old official at American University in West Beirut. He and 
seven other Americans are among the 14 Western hostages still held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Cicippio's execution was twice delayed during the week, then suspended Thursday 
night as the kidnapers proposed instead an "initiative" to Israel demanding the 
release of Obeid and an unspecified number of Lebanese and Palestinians held by 
the Israelis. It demanded a response "within days." No mention was made of a 
hostage trade. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli has made a public offer to trade Obeid, two men captured with him and 
other Shiite prisoners in return for three Israeli soldiers held captive in 
Lebanon and all the foreign hostages there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Mention of Israeli Soldiers 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Justice statement released Sunday made no mention of the 
Israeli soldiers. However, in an interview Sunday with Western reporters in the 
Shiite stronghold of Baalbek in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, a senior leader of 
Hezbollah, Hussein Moussawi, threatened to kill one of the Israelis if Obeid 
was not released. Release of the three soldiers is the key to any deal for 
Obeid, Israelis officials have said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Moussawi also admitted that some of the kidnapers holding foreign hostages are 
known to the leadership of Hezbollah, a fundamentalist Islamic movement. "We 
hold consultations with them from time to time," he told the reporters. "There 
are telephone calls, hellos between us." 
</P>
<P>
In two days of feverish diplomatic contacts on the hostage crisis, Sheik 
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of Hezbollah, has denied any 
direct knowledge of the kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah issued a statement Saturday denying that it was involved in 
negotiations for a prisoner exchange with the Israelis. "We affirm that 
Hezbollah has no direct or indirect links with the hostage issue and with 
negotiations concerning it," the message insisted. "The matter concerns only 
the kidnapers. Everyone knows that and knows how to get to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomats Remain Cautious 
</P>
<P>
While Sunday's statement by the Revolutionary Justice Organization suggested 
movement on the hostage issue, foreign diplomats and others involved in the 
busy round of contacts during the week were more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Syria, Nabih Berri, whose Amal movement is locked in a 
long-running struggle for power with Hezbollah among Lebanon's Shiite Muslims, 
warned Sunday that prospects were slim for an immediate prisoner swap between 
Israel and pro-Iranian Shiite radicals that would involve the foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's proposal, which Israeli spokesman Liel said Sunday night still stands, 
has no chance at present, Berri said. "That is what I believe." The Lebanese 
leader met in Damascus with U.N. Undersecretary Marrack Goulding, who is taking 
soundings on the possibility of a hostage deal. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the problem in Lebanon is a general problem," Berri told a British 
interviewer. "To finish the problem of the hostages . . . we have to help to 
resolve the Lebanese problem, to change the regime in Lebanon," where the 
Christian minority is engaged in a 14-year-long civil war with the Muslim 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
Goulding told reporters he still senses "a kind of subdued optimism" that the 
hostage crisis could be resolved with the release of the 14 Westerners held 
captive in Lebanon. But he, too, was pessimistic about an early release. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Painful Process' 
</P>
<P>
"The release of the hostages is going to be a long and sometimes difficult and 
painful process of quiet diplomacy," he said, "conducted in private and not by 
public statements." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials privately raised the possibility that the contradictions and 
confusion caused by the almost daily statements by Shiite organizations in 
Lebanon may reflect divisions between moderates and hard-liners in the Iranian 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It poses the question of who is in charge," one said. Liel, the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, commented: "We believe that if all the countries that have 
hostages in Lebanon stick together and coordinate, their chances are better."

AMERICAN ALBUM: PRESCRIPTIONS FOR AN AGED PATIENT, THE POISON-DAMAGED TREATY 
OAK, INCLUDE BOTH SCIENCE, TALISMANS.

AUSTIN, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Giedraitis opened the package that had come in the morning mail. The 
talisman inside was for the ailing Treaty Oak. 
</P>
<P>
"May fear and hate become peace and love," it read. "May poison become the 
water of life. And may you be healed." With it was a letter from the sender, 
one Erik Felker of Burbank, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just today's basket of goodies," Giedraitis said as he stuck the charm 
into the ground. Someone else had already sent a crystal reputed to have 
healing powers, and it was tucked into the knot of the tree. A suggestion had 
been made that playing Indian sitar music would help save the gigantic, 
600-year-old oak. 
</P>
<P>
Giedraitis' jovial manner on this hot afternoon belied the very serious nature 
of his work and the importance of his gnarled patient. As Austin's urban 
forester, he has spent the past two months as head of a team of experts 
desperately trying to save the Treaty Oak -- one of the nation's grandest tree 
specimens -- from a poisoning that was discovered just before the Memorial Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The poison, however, is still coursing through the historic tree and killing 
each new flush of leaves. Someone poured on enough of the herbicide Velpar to 
kill the Treaty Oak 20 times over, and the odds are that this much-loved 
patient will die. 
</P>
<P>
The Treaty Oak shades a quiet neighborhood street near downtown Austin. Its 
name derived from the legend -- probably unfounded -- that Stephen F. Austin 
signed the first boundary agreement with the Indians under its branches in 
1824. 
</P>
<P>
The tree held a special place in history long before then, long before Texas 
was even Texas. The Indians believed that drinking a special concoction made 
from the tree's acorns would assure warriors of return home from battle, and 
use of another brew was believed to ensure a mate's fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the American Forestry Assn. enshrined the Treaty Oak in its Hall of 
Fame for Trees, dubbing it the most perfect North American specimen. When it 
was in danger of being cut down a few years later, a campaign to save it spread 
across Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Giedraitis proposed to his wife under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
When he received a call reporting that the tree seemed to be ailing, the first 
thing that crossed his mind was that it might be afflicted with oak wilt, a 
disease that has killed an estimated 10,000 oaks around Austin in the last 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
When state laboratory tests detected the herbicide, DuPont, which manufactures 
Velpar, offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to conviction of the 
poisoner. Billionaire H. Ross Perot, the richest man in Texas, stepped in then 
and offered to foot the bill for the best treatment money could buy. 
</P>
<P>
A task force assembled from around the country recommended that the tree be 
sprayed and shaded and that all the soil around it be excavated to a point 
where no more poison was detectable. Large sun screens attached to telephone 
poles now surround the tree, and its leaves are bathed by a custom sprinkler 
system every 30 minutes. In the most recent attempt at expunging the poison, a 
mild saline solution was injected into hundreds of tiny holes drilled into the 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
The treatments so far have cost $63,000. Giedraitis said the fate of the Treaty 
Oak will be known for certain in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police had been working the case hard. Almost a month after the 
poisoning was discovered, they arrested a drifter and former convict, Paul 
Stedman Cullen. He has been charged with criminal mischief. So far, there is no 
known motive for the poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Each day now, people drop by to pay their respects to this tree that was here 
long before the city. Some bow their heads in prayer; others just read the 
Treaty Oak historical marker. Many also sign the posters that are attached to 
the chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Get well, Treaty Oak," reads one inscription penned in a very young hand. 
"Hope you get better soon. Don't die."

CUBA SAID TO SEIZE HUMAN RIGHTS CRITICS

<P>
Three leading human rights activists who outspokenly criticized the regime of 
Cuban President Fidel Castro were arrested in pre-dawn raids on their homes in 
Havana on Sunday, according to a representative of Cuban rights organizations 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The three, Elizardo Sanchez, Hubert Jerez and Hiram Abi Cobas were picked up 
only days after they complained to visiting American journalists of an 
intensified crackdown against dissidents by the Castro government. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ramon Cernuda, the Miami representative of the Havana human rights 
groups who had been in touch with Havana by telephone, security police raided 
the homes of the three men at 5 a.m., seizing papers and books. Cernuda said 
the security police who seized Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission of Human 
Rights and National Conciliation, also took an enlarged photo of the rights 
leader with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) taken during a trip to the United 
States last year. 
</P>
<P>
Jerez heads the year-old Jose Marti Human Rights organization and Abi Cobas is 
acting head of the Human Rights Party, founded a year ago by members of another 
activist group, the Cuban Human Rights Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting With Journalists 
</P>
<P>
Cernuda said no reason for the arrests was given, but it was believed that the 
government action stemmed from remarks the three men made in their meeting with 
the foreign journalists 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Sanchez and other activists had been allowed limited freedom in 
contacting foreign diplomats and journalists to complain of rights abuses by 
the Castro regime which, since late 1987, had been attempting to polish its 
human rights image. The regime even permitted Sanchez to visit the United 
States for a few weeks last year. 
</P>
<P>
But official tolerance of the dissidents has waned this year, particularly 
during the April visit to Cuba by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when 
Sanchez said that more than 60 activists were detained. Sanchez was briefly 
detained by security police in mid-April, and he was denied permission to make 
another long-planned trip to the United States in June. 
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with American reporters 10 days ago, Sanchez and the two 
other rights leaders characterized the executions of four Cuban officials 
convicted of drug trafficking last month as "assassinations" and reported that 
the rights of the doomed men's families to claim their bodies had been violated 
when they were buried secretly. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez also complained that the Castro regime was showing increasing contempt 
for human rights and had begun an intensified campaign against the country's 
rights organizations, which are technically illegal under Communist Cuba's 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Cuba's official news agency said Sunday that the 
longtime financial director in the Interior Ministry had killed himself, having 
expressed "shame" over his colleagues' involvement in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuban Official's Suicide 
</P>
<P>
"Victim of a severe state of depression, Col. Rafael Alvarez Cueto, who worked 
for years as chief of the finance bureau of Interior Ministry, took his life," 
Prensa Latina said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez left two letters to friends and family expressing his "dejection and 
shame" over revelations that some Interior Ministry officials engaged in the 
trafficking of narcotics to the United States, Prensa Latina said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities have been reorganizing the Interior Ministry and other 
agencies since June 12, when the government publicly acknowledged the 
involvement of some officials in the trafficking of cocaine and marijuana.

LANGE TO RESIGN AS PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND

Prime Minister David Lange said today that he is resigning but plans to remain 
a member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, 47, who underwent a heart operation last year, told a news conference 
that medical advice had influenced his decision to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, prime minister since 1984, said he will tender his resignation to 
Governor General Paul Reeves on Tuesday and will then ask the ruling Labor 
Party to elect a leader and deputy leader. 
</P>
<P>
Lange said he expected the new prime minister to name a new Cabinet by the end 
of the week. He said he would not take a Cabinet post himself. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, who used to relax by racing motor cars before an operation to widen a 
heart artery in July, 1988, said his doctor had told him: "My not continuing 
(as prime minister) would be compatible with my health." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication if Lange's decision to resign was connected 
with a bitter row with former Finance Minister Roger Douglas that has 
threatened to split the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Lange dismissed Douglas, once his closest ally, last December over the scope 
and speed of New Zealand's drastic economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has been fighting back ever since and last week won a new place in the 
Cabinet after topping a poll among Labor members of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Lange responded with a pledge that Douglas would not be given a portfolio that 
enabled him to influence economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar fell sharply after Lange's resignation was announced.

A Soviet diplomat on Sunday said Moscow has joined in the flurry of diplomatic 
maneuvering to try to free Western hostages held by Shiite extremists who 
continue to insist that Israel release a Muslim cleric it seized. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet ambassador in Beirut, Vasily I. Kolotusha, said in a statement 
issued Sunday that "efforts to settle the hostage issue have been essentially 
pushed forward." 
</P>
<P>
"In response to a request by the United States, the Soviet Union has been 
conducting contacts with regional parties to help reach a political settlement 
to the hostages matter," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet envoy appeared to be hinting that Syria, Moscow's main regional 
ally, and Iran, which has been seeking better Soviet relations, are being asked 
by the Kremlin to exert pressure on their Lebanese Shiite allies.

U.S. TO CHALLENGE SOVIETS ON NICARAGUA ARMS 
</P>

<P>
The United States will challenge the Soviet Union this week over what U.S. 
officials charge is an unkept promise by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
to stop arms deliveries to Nicaragua, aides said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told President Bush in a letter in May that the Soviet Union had 
responded to U.S. complaints by cutting off its supply of weaponry to 
Nicaragua's Marxist regime. 
</P>
<P>
But officials traveling to Mexico with Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
said that while Soviet arms shipments have dropped, arms deliveries from East 
Germany, Cuba and other Soviet Bloc nations appear to have increased markedly, 
leaving the overall level of shipments slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a perplexing coincidence between the drop in Soviet shipments and the 
increase from the rest of the Soviet Bloc," one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another official said that the assistant secretary of state for inter-American 
affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, will demand an explanation of the shipments when 
he meets in London this week with Yuri I. Pavlov, a Soviet deputy foreign 
minister and Latin American specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua depends entirely on the Soviet Bloc to equip its 65,000-member army, 
the largest in Central America. The United States has long asked the Soviet 
Union to reduce its support for the ruling Sandinistas but until May had 
received no positive response. 
</P>
<P>
Since Gorbachev's letter, they said, there have been encouraging signs from 
Moscow of a willingness to cooperate with the United States in the region -- 
but few, if any, concrete acts. 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet deliveries of guns and ammunition to Nicaragua appear to have 
stopped, one official said, the Soviet Union is still delivering helicopters 
and other militarily-useful equipment to Managua. 
</P>
<P>
And in neighboring El Salvador, arms shipments from Cuba to the Marxist-led 
guerrillas have increased significantly in recent months, several officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker discussed the issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
in Paris on July 29 but received no satisfactory reply, officials said. In the 
wake of that exchange, Baker directed Aronson to bring up the issue more 
strongly in his meeting with Pavlov this week. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet policy toward Nicaragua is regarded by many Bush Administration 
officials as a key test of Gorbachev's claim of "new thinking" in Soviet 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Baker arrived in the Mexican capital Sunday night, heading a delegation of 
record size -- 41 U.S. officials, including five Cabinet members -- for 
meetings with Mexican leaders that will deal with subjects ranging from debt 
relief to Tijuana sewers. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state hailed the new, more cooperative atmosphere in 
U.S.-Mexican relations that has followed the inauguration of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship (between the United States and Mexico) used to be 
characterized as one of managing irritants," Baker said. "We'd like to build 
one that could be characterized as creating common opportunities."

ARMY TROOPS BACK UP FIREFIGHTERS AT IDAHO BLAZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 9,000 firefighters bolstered by Army troops battled brush and timber 
blazes in remote areas of Idaho on Sunday amid forecasts of stronger winds, 
unstable air and even lightning, which caused most of the wildfires raging 
through some 90,000 acres in the state. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 soldiers from Ft. Carson, Colo., arrived Saturday night in Boise for 
firefighting assignments, and an additional 500 soldiers from Ft. Riley, Kan., 
were due today. The Idaho National Guard has been on fire assignments for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 22 major fires burning in Idaho, many in rugged areas where 
smoke and terrain made it difficult to assess the damage, said Rebecca Burkhead 
of the Boise Interagency Fire Center. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the West, 37 major fires were raging over 180,000 acres, Burkhead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Utah firefighters hoped to have a 1,500-acre blaze in Chalk Creek Canyon fully 
controlled by today. The fire did not threaten any structures. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon fire crews worked Sunday to contain four more fires in the eastern part 
of the state, but scorching temperatures and bolts of lightning had officials 
worried about new blazes flaring up. 
</P>
<P>
The largest Oregon blaze close to containment was the Canal Fire in the 
Enterprise Complex, about three miles east of Wallowa Lake near the Eagle Cap 
Wilderness. It has burned 23,350 acres, Liz Rayno of the Northwest Interagency 
Coordination Center said. 
</P>
<P>
A week-old wildfire in the Sierra Nevada foothills of Central California was 
declared 80% contained Sunday. There were 2,163 personnel working on the 
7,000-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, firefighters gained the upper hand on an 8-day-old fire 
that scorched 15,100 acres in Cleveland National Forest and crept within three 
miles of the famed Palomar Mountain Observatory before switching direction. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze near San Diego was 75% contained by some 2,500 firefighters by early 
Sunday.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: GYM WILL STAY A PLACE FOR HULKS OF STERNER STUFF

<P>
For 42 years, Stern's Gym in North Park has been a beacon to the 
biceps-possessed. 
</P>
<P>
Jack LaLanne and Vic Tanny came and went, but Stern's endured, even when the 
business downstairs was a chicken slaughterhouse and the summertime stench 
could knock a man to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
Now a Chinese laundry is downstairs and Stern's is a legend: the only remaining 
male-only, no-nonsense weightlifting parlor in San Diego County -- no aerobics, 
no dancercize, no MTV, no family discounts, nothing but weights and 
large-muscled men dedicated to their use. 
</P>
<P>
Think of "Rocky I." The wooden-slat floor shakes when the weights go bang. 
</P>
<P>
Stern's idea of air conditioning is opening the fire-escape door. The showers 
dribble a brown something; the air is thick with sweat socks. 
</P>
<P>
A newcomer to Stern's is someone who's only been coming a decade. Bill Pearl, a 
former Mr. 
</P>
<P>
Universe, pumped at Stern's. So did Lou Ferrigno ("The Incredible Hulk"), 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and numerous Chargers and Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
"Modern weight-lifting in Southern California started at Stern's," said Ron 
Flisher, 44, a UC San Diego custodial supervisor who has been coming to Stern's 
since he was a tight end for the Aztecs in the 1960s. "Everybody came here." 
</P>
<P>
The boss of the place was Leo Stern, a gruff former Army drill instructor to 
whom "whaddyawant?" was a term of endearment. His motto: Pay up or get out. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the 68-year-old Stern sold the place on Granada Avenue just off 
University, although he retains a weightlifting equipment store nearby and a 
women's gym around the block. 
</P>
<P>
His youngest son, who helped him run the gym, died this spring of cancer. Leo 
Stern wants to devote more time to raising American pit bull terriers. 
</P>
<P>
Will Stern's go modern? With ladies' nights, social events and classes on 
proper grooming? 
</P>
<P>
Stuff it, says the new owner, Timothy S. Mauricio, 30. Stern's will stay 
Stern's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to ruin the place with a lot of chrome and new carpet," said 
Mauricio. "There are plenty of places where you can go and lift some weights 
and try to party with the girls wearing tights. Stern's is strictly for 
gladiators."Runway as Road to Glory 
</P>
<P>
Take heart, married women of California. Caryn Levitt of Vista is in Dallas as 
your standard bearer. 
</P>
<P>
Levitt, 26, mother of one, stepmother of two more, a graduate of a high school 
in Escondido and a fashion academy in San Diego, is Mrs. 
</P>
<P>
California International. By week's end, she hopes to be Mrs. U.S. 
International. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the state pageant in Los Angeles, she's up against 47 other state 
winners in the weeklong beauty-and-talent pageant at the Dallas Convention 
Center. Television actor Don Galloway (late of "General Hospital") will crown 
the winner Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Levitt is a competitor. She was Miss Valley Center 1981, Miss Greater San Diego 
1985 and second runner-up Miss California USA 1986. She loves it. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of courage to get up there in front of people and be judged," 
she said. "I grew up in Valley Center by showing horses at horse shows. This is 
an extension of that, except that I'm showing myself rather than a horse." 
</P>
<P>
She gained 70 pounds before the birth of her son, Robert, eight months ago. Now 
she's back to runway trim. Her husband, Art, is manager of the meat market at 
Alpha Beta in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The prizes in Dallas are not skimpy: round-trip air fare anywhere, five days at 
a Sheraton, a suntan bed, a gold and diamond necklace, a $10,000 fur coat, and 
a 21-piece set of Saladmaster cookware. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the crowns, beauty titles have not gone to her head. She still 
thinks of herself as "a bow-legged tomboy." She doesn't want to hear any 
blah-blah about pageants exploiting women. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a basketball star or class valedictorian in school," she said. "You 
go with what you're given in this world. That's what I'm doing. I'm going for 
it."

JUDGES WIN COURT TURF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
THEY GAIN CONTROL OF CLERKS, VOW TO IMPROVE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The way things get done at your local county courthouse just got shaken up -- 
again. 
</P>
<P>
This latest bit of business, the newest in a unprecedented series of changes 
that have swept the state's Superior Courts in recent months, is the product of 
what was once characterized as a "turf war." 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court judges have been unanimously declared the winners. The 
elected county clerks are the clear losers. The state Constitution was the 
battleground. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the winners walked away with the power to hire and fire the 
clerks who work in the courts with them. 
</P>
<P>
The real dynamite, however, is that, sparked by a case that started in San 
Diego, Superior Court judges in various counties have been given the green 
light by the state Supreme Court to go for control of anything in a county 
clerk's office that's court-related. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Want It All 
</P>
<P>
And at least in San Diego, they say they want it all. 
</P>
<P>
If they get it, the local judges say, they promise a courthouse where you're 
greeted by pleasant, well-equipped clerks who genuinely care about serving the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"The person on the street should expect to be greeted by a reasonably content, 
pleasant, well-equipped, albeit overworked, person and get their business done 
and get out of here, not stand around waiting and suffering through the trials 
and tribulations they might otherwise have to put up with," Judge Wayne L. 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied that I speak for the entire Superior Court when I say that's the 
environment we want to create with the expansion of our responsibility for the 
courtroom clerks and attendant staff," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
County Clerk Robert Zumwalt takes exception to the implied criticism. "We're 
getting the job done," Zumwalt said. "That's the main thing. We're getting the 
job done with limited resources. I've never had to tell a judge that judge 
couldn't have a trial because there wasn't a clerk. That's never happened." 
</P>
<P>
The shift in authority over the clerks is in keeping with the wave of change 
rolling through the Superior Courts. 
</P>
<P>
"You just stop, stand back, take a look at it, we're going through -- I'm using 
this word by design -- an exciting period of time for the judiciary in 
California," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Changes 
</P>
<P>
"More has happened in the last 18 months to change the face of the judiciary, 
not only its size but its composition, its management style and its authority, 
than in the history of California," he said. "I don't think there's been any 
other time when these many dynamic forces have been at play in one moment than 
now. It's going to change the way the judiciary does business for the next 50 
to 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom clerks case appears to be the most important of those 
developments to come from a court ruling, said the winning lawyer in the case, 
Kenneth Andreen of Fresno, a former justice on the 5th District Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gigantic opinion in terms of administration of justice," Andreen said. 
"I can't think of a more important opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The other changes are due to action from the executive and legislative branches 
-- as well as on the streets: 
</P>
<P>
* Last September, Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law two bills implementing 
a plan calling on the state to finance county trial courts. In the last half of 
the 1988-89 fiscal year, the state was to provide counties $206 million. By the 
1997-98 fiscal year, the annual block grant will grow to $601.5 million, 
according to legislative estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that the state should fund local courts was first broached in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
* Deukmejian has appointed 362 of the state's 724 Superior Court judges, or 
exactly half, since he took office in 1983, according to statistics from the 
governor's press office in Sacramento and the Administrative Office of the 
Courts in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Deukmejian has appointed 42 of 62 judges. Nine more are due by 
the end of the year, said Judge Michael I. Greer, the court's presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
* Criminal filings are on the rise. In San Diego, for instance, felony filings 
rose 28% in 1988 from 1987, to 11,988, Greer said at a recent press conference. 
Superior Courts handle felonies as well as civil cases worth more than $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
* A 1986 legislative initiative popularly called "fast track" has changed the 
way civil cases move toward trial. Lawyers and clients no longer control the 
pace of litigation. Instead, judges set deadlines and hold contempt hearings 
for attorneys who fail to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
The program got under way in San Diego in 1987. It spread to eight of the 
state's other largest counties in 1988, and moves to all the state's counties 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, it used to take up to five years to close a case. In San 
Diego's pilot program, 90% of civil cases filed after 1987 are concluding in 
two years, according to the court's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
* "Fast track" cases in some counties are assigned to one judge from start to 
finish, the same way cases are handled in federal court. The practice in state 
courts had been to move a case through different judges as it proceeded toward 
trial. In San Diego County, the courts are moving toward the new system. 
</P>
<P>
* The increased size, the faster pace, increasing automation and other changes 
at the courts have created a demand for professional court managers, a 
"profession that has emerged in the last decade," said the San Diego court's 
new executive officer, Kenneth Martone. 
</P>
<P>
Martone took over the job just two weeks ago. He beat out 62 other candidates, 
Greer's office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Court management was the most important factor behind the case of the courtroom 
clerks. 
</P>
<P>
A courtroom clerk prepares the informal court orders called "minutes," which 
summarize what happens in court. Among other tasks, the clerk can also handle a 
judge's calendar, call the roll of jurors and swear witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
In the state's Municipal Courts and appellate courts, as well as in federal 
courts, the courtroom clerks work for the judges. In the Superior Courts, by 
historical accident, they worked for the county clerk. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, the San Diego judges adopted a rule transferring 121 courtroom 
clerks from Zumwalt to their executive officer, who was then William Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Under Zumwalt, the clerks were inadequately trained and didn't have the 
equipment they needed for the job, Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most glaring examples, Greer said, was that the clerks didn't -- and 
still don't -- have a computer or silent typewriter for use in the courtrooms. 
That meant they had to work when court was not in session, usually through 
lunch or overtime, to type their "minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The real problem, though, was the "dual line of authority," Greer said. "It 
created an impossible situation, a pull and a tug, between the county clerk who 
would want the clerk to do something and the judge who would want the clerk to 
do something else." 
</P>
<P>
The judges' rule was passed under a 1971 state law that was amended five years 
later to permit them to pass exactly that kind of rule. Zumwalt, however, said 
the law violated the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
A section of the Constitution says the county clerk is the clerk of the 
Superior Court by virtue of being county clerk. As such, the clerk has certain 
core duties that cannot be transferred, including control of the courtroom 
clerks, Zumwalt argued. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego said Zumwalt 
was wrong. It also called the dispute a "turf war." 
</P>
<P>
The next February, Greer postponed civil trials for what turned out to be three 
weeks, laying part of the blame for the moratorium on the clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Greer charged that Zumwalt failed to keep him up-to-date on the growing number 
of criminal cases facing dismissal unless trials began immediately. Zumwalt 
argued that the problem was created by the county's swelling criminal caseload 
and a shortage of judges. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis ended when Deukmejian appointed seven men to the bench on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
Zumwalt, meanwhile, appealed his 4th District loss to the state Supreme Court. 
Last Monday it also ruled in favor of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional section Zumwalt cited requires a county clerk to do what the 
Legislature says, Justice David Eagleson said. But simply being clerk creates 
no right to perform duties the Legislature has permitted judges to transfer to 
a court executive officer, Eagleson said for a court unanimous on those two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The decision validated rules adopted by the Superior Courts in at least eight 
other counties around the state, said Andreen, the winning lawyer. A Riverside 
County rule is still before the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I think other counties may follow suit -- but they may not," Andreen said. "A 
court is not going to undertake the administrative burden of supervising court 
clerks if the job is being done adequately by the county clerk." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling does not affect counties where the county clerk and executive office 
have been combined. These include Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The decision left Zumwalt, minus the courtroom clerks, with the court's 
business office, the court records, the exhibit room and such non-court duties 
as marriage licenses and registering fictitious business names. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised is what I'm going to say," Zumwalt said. "It's very 
difficult to get judges to rule against judges." 
</P>
<P>
The surprise is that the judges didn't stop. In a footnote, Eagleson said that 
to the extent a 1986 Court of Appeal opinion suggested some court-related 
duties must be left to the county clerk to "avoid destruction of the office," 
it is "disapproved." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Stanley Mosk disagreed. The Legislature cannot "authorize a total 
reassignment" of the clerk's duties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only Justice Allen Broussard, however, joined that part of Mosk's dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Given that 5-2 go-ahead, Greer said he "wants to bring over more than 121" 
because he wants "to be able to manage the things that are being mismanaged 
that are not covered." 
</P>
<P>
"Because we feel the responsibility for managing the system, I'm going to 
suggest that we consider legislation" to bring under the judges' umbrella the 
clerks in the business and records offices as well as those in the exhibit 
room, Greer said. He said last week that he had no timetable for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the judges will have to confront some very uncertain clerks. A 
specific state law says that clerks in San Diego County who transfer to the 
judges' side of the aisle not only lose the civil service benefits they had 
under Zumwalt, they serve at the judges' pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"What's so hard for us to understand is that I joined the county government for 
security reasons and I'm losing something I cherish dearly," said Carol Bozlee, 
one of the 121. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale here is at an all-time low," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another law gives the transferring clerks the opportunity to engage in 
collective bargaining, said Tony Albers, a chief deputy at the San Diego County 
counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
"To be quite blunt with you, I assume they're going to obtain union 
representation," Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the judges and clerks enter their brave new world, the irony is that 
they didn't have to get there this way, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This matter has turned into one with statewide if not countrywide 
implications," he said. "But if we could have worked out a compromise, with a 
merging of the clerk's office and the courts (as in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco), the recalcitrance of the clerk would not have worked to the 
disadvantage of clerks throughout the state. I believe this one will."

SOME DOWNTOWNERS LIKE THE FUTURISTIC PASSAGEWAYS BUT DISILLUSIONED URBAN 
PLANNERS SAY L.A. MAY GET NO MORE

<P>
Legal secretary Annie Yakutis traverses at least three pedestrian walkways each 
morning as she rushes five blocks from where she parks her car at 2nd and 
Figueroa streets to the law office where she works atop Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"The pedways are sort of futuristic," said Yakutis, making the turn with two 
colleagues between pedways crossing Figueroa and 3rd streets. "It brings a 
'Blade Runner' aspect to our daily lives. There is a science fiction element to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The relatively few pedestrians who have discovered and use downtown Los 
Angeles' system of 10 elevated public pedways and or concrete foot bridges -- 
scurrying from residence or garages to office, or from office to appointments, 
lunch or shopping -- praise it as convenient, safe, healthful and fun. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they point out minor problems with cleanliness and major 
problems with byzantine design, which attorney Karen Ann Widess says forces a 
pedestrian to "do a lot of upping and downing" in the buildings linking the 
pedways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planners Disappointed 
</P>
<P>
Users wish the system stretched farther -- but that isn't going to happen, say 
planners who became disillusioned with pedways about the time the first system 
around Bunker Hill was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive enclosed pedway systems have been successful in eastern cities where 
cold winters make heated passageways attractive -- St. Paul, Minneapolis, 
Atlanta, for instance. Similarly, humid Houston has kept pedestrians happy with 
an air-conditioned system built mostly underground. But extreme temperatures 
pose no problem in Los Angeles' climate, making a pedway system less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
There is a bigger reason to explain planner wariness toward expanding the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles," said John Spalding, director of planning and urban design at 
the Community Redevelopment Agency, "it has been found in certain cases that 
street life can suffer if you force people to go up to a second level pedway 
system." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's favorite example of the kind of street life it hopes to foster 
throughout downtown happens along Broadway, a teeming shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Street Activity' 
</P>
<P>
"We find it is more desirable to reactivate the streets or to maintain street 
activity," Spalding said. "We need the interaction between pedestrians and 
vehicles. On Broadway, drivers cruise the streets, see what movie is playing, 
see if their friends are on the street, then park and walk around." 
</P>
<P>
Private planners agree that elevating pedestrians above streets is a bad idea 
for Los Angeles. Like Spalding, they endorse isolated, privately built 
pedestrian bridges linking a parking garage to a plant or linking separate 
buildings of one establishment, such as the California Mart downtown. But they 
consider any extensive system of public pedways outdated thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown, this whole second level for pedestrians, with cars on the first 
level, has just made it very uncomfortable along the ground level," said Elaine 
Carbrey, planner and architect with the Gruen Associates urban planning firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say you can have it on both levels, but you can't, because there 
is just not that much retail to go around. And it is costly for the developer 
to build in two lobbies in every office building." 
</P>
<P>
An angry critic of this attitude is Calvin S. Hamilton, Los Angeles' former 
city planner who designed a more extensive downtown pedway system. City 
planners, however, do not currently plan to build more of the walkways. 
</P>
<P>
"If pedways had been done the way we recommended," he said, "it would have 
created a much better pedestrian environment in the central business district. 
It would certainly have made it easier to walk around, and would have eased the 
traffic congestion." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their disillusionment with elevated pedways, the current planning 
officials are not about to tear down the 10 that did get built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design Concepts 
</P>
<P>
The Bunker Hill pedways, Spalding said, were planned 20 years ago for two 
reasons -- to help pedestrians conquer the steep topography of the hill itself, 
and to serve as a feeder system for a mechanized "People Mover." The 
Disneyland-style carts, aborted when the federal government eliminated funding 
in 1981, would have had stations one level above the pedways at the World Trade 
Center, California Plaza, and the 444 S. Flower building. 
</P>
<P>
Usage of the current pedways has never been measured. 
</P>
<P>
An informal count indicated that several hundred commuters use the Flower and 
5th Street bridges for daily treks from car to office; while the Figueroa 
pedways are far less traveled. 
</P>
<P>
While planners debate their merits, the pedways are enthusiastically endorsed 
by those who use them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the fastest way between parking in the Arco Plaza Garage and my office in 
Arco Towers. It's a direct line," said attorney Roland G. Simpson as he dashed 
over pedways crossing Flower Street, wrapping around the outside southeast 
corner of the Bonaventure Hotel and crossing 5th Street to Arco Towers. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps you out of traffic," added Eric Bader, an accountant walking the same 
route. 
</P>
<P>
"I ride buses, and I use these little bridges to save time getting to work from 
the bus stop or going out to lunch," said Lauretta Brown, rushing from the 
Bonaventure to her office in the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
The pedways also are said to be safe. Unlike downtown city sidewalks, the 
pedways appear untraveled by the homeless asking for handouts, or shadier 
characters bent on crime. An expensive pair of sunglasses and two metal 
measuring tapes left on the Security Pacific pedway across Flower one recent 
morning remained there untouched two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Connecting through major buildings, the well-lighted pedways inherit an 
unofficial police force among the 24-hour guard stations paid for by each 
business complex. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor, a World Trade Center guard, said one recent midnight that the 
most potentially threatening people he sees wandering along the pedways during 
his Monday-Friday 11:30 p.m. to 8 a.m. graveyard shift are "maybe a few people 
who might be drinking too much" at the nearby hotel lounges. They can be loud, 
he said, but they aren't dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, a few pedway walkers complain about uncleanliness, 
although the public system remains relatively free of trash, graffiti, and dirt 
that can plague sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"One day last year someone left a cup of ice cream on top of one of these 
railings," said legal assistant Richard Magee, indicating the 3rd Street 
bridge. "And it melted and melted and melted for about a month. Nobody cleans 
up." 
</P>
<P>
The universal complaint about pedways, however, is that they are difficult to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Private planner Carbrey of Gruen Associates said she had never walked the 
downtown pedways at all because she considers them "poorly designed . . . out 
of the way and not easy to find." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Course 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the goals of planners in the 1960s of moving from 1st to 6th 
without touching a street, the pedestrian must find his way along the unmarked 
public easement through the grounds of the residential Bunker Hill Towers; walk 
through the World Trade Center on its second story; take an escalator up to the 
pedway entering the Bonaventure on the north at its sixth floor; and meander 
around the hotel's round silos to find the south pedway, which signs indicate 
is on the hotel's third floor but is reached by taking outdoor concrete stairs 
down to the second floor. The trip is completed by crossing 5th Street and 
riding down an escalator -- if it is working -- to return to earth by entering 
Arco Plaza at the street level. 
</P>
<P>
Yakutis said she considers the lack of directions throughout the system merely 
another recreational element of the pedways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun," she said, "to find out how many different ways you can get 
from Point A to Point B in downtown Los Angeles."

HOMEOWNERS SEEK OUTSIDE BRADLEY PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their first plunge into the controversy over Mayor Tom Bradley's financial 
affairs, a coalition of Los Angeles homeowner organizations demanded Sunday 
that an independent counsel be appointed to investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the need to remove politics from the inquiry, about 40 community 
activists -- most from suburban areas -- gathered on the front steps of City 
Hall to ask that an impartial lawyer take over the investigation from City 
Atty. James K. Hahn, whose ties to the mayor, they complained, will compromise 
any final report. 
</P>
<P>
"No disrespect, but we feel that Inspector Clouseau might do a better job than 
Jimmy Hahn," said Norton Halpern, representative of the Hollywood Homeowners 
and Tenants Assn. "This is not an attack on Mayor Bradley but an attack on the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Federal, state and local agencies are looking into Bradley's stock transactions 
and whether his influence resulted in the deposit of city funds into Far East 
National Bank, for which he was a paid adviser. He has denied using his 
official position to benefit himself or business associates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized by Valley Groups 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's press conference was organized by a coalition of 10 Valley homeowner 
groups that had mailed out 400 letters last week to invite other community 
organizations. About 15 groups were represented, only one from South-Central 
Los Angeles and none from the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers vowed to expand their campaign for a special investigator, speak 
before City Council committees and launch a telephone campaign targeting 
members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition called on the City Council to appoint a special counsel, 
preferably from outside of California, who would use the council's subpoena 
powers to obtain sworn testimony from witnesses as part of an independent 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the coalition charged, the inquiry has been sidetracked by the 
political agendas of a few council members who, in turn, have neglected the 
daily, pressing business of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been whitewashed so far," said Salvatore Grammatico, head of 
the Coalition of Concerned Communities, which is based on the Westside. "It's 
time we know what is really going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cloud of Suspicion' 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hunter, a Hollywood community activist, said that he has been a faithful 
supporter of Bradley but that the mayor has "come down a couple of pegs" in his 
estimation. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the cloud of suspicion hangs over City Hall, the city of Los 
Angeles cannot move forward," Hunter said. "And the only way to clear the 
suspicion is an independent investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members of the coalition have not been Bradley supporters in the 
past. Several are veterans of fights against airport noise, mass transit lines 
and other development issues that have aligned them with Bradley rivals such as 
Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Nate Holden. 
</P>
<P>
But they insisted that they were not after the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"We must get the final answer, if Mayor Bradley is guilty as charged or 
innocent," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners' Assn. 
"I think (an independent investigation) is his best shot at having his 
reputation restored." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the deepening crisis Bradley faces, the mayor continues to receive 
shows of support. Hours after the homeowners' press conference, Bradley was 
honored at the Nisei Week Grand Parade in Little Tokyo, where later in the day 
Japanese-American community organizations were to observe Tom Bradley 
Appreciation Day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a very good mayor to our community," said Tosh Terasawa, president 
of the Japanese American Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Watts organization presented Bradley with a plaque that carried 
the signatures of several hundred supporters. And on Saturday, about 30 of his 
closest backers pledged to help him raise $300,000 for legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Hahn on Sunday were unsuccessful, but he has said that a 
special investigator is not necessary. Bradley also has said he believes the 
appropriate agencies are already involved. 
</P>
<P>
Some City Council members, though leery about taking on an investigation, have 
expressed interest in hiring an independent counsel if needed, once Hahn's 
effort is completed.

The number of people suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, a trauma disorder 
caused by repetitive and stressful motions of the hand and wrist, may be far 
higher than recognized, the results of a California study suggest. Carpal 
tunnel syndrome is marked by pain and numbness in the hand and wrist. Evidence 
of injury has been found among garment workers, butchers, grocery checkers, 
assembly-line workers, typists and musicians, among others. But the Centers for 
Disease Control reports that reliable information on the number of people 
affected is lacking, in part because health professionals are not trained to 
detect it. 
</P>
<P>
This view is borne out by a survey undertaken last year by the California 
Occupational Health Program in Santa Clara County and reported last month in 
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Of 515 health-care providers, 95% 
reported caring for a total of 7,214 people suffering from carpal tunnel 
syndrome. Of those, 3,413 cases were deemed work-related. This compares with 
just 71 work-related cases reported to the state in 1986.

3 APPARENTLY HELD HOSTAGE BY ALIEN SMUGGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two women and a 6-year-old boy were apparently robbed and held hostage Sunday 
by smugglers who brought them across the Mexican border, a spokesman for the U. 
S. Border Patrol said. One woman escaped and the others were released unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The trio was picked up by the smugglers early Sunday and taken to Los Angeles, 
as they had been promised, Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg said. But when 
the women failed to come up with $1,500 required as payment, the smugglers 
drove them back to San Diego County and held them captive in a house in San 
Ysidro, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Border agents learned of the apparent kidnaping shortly after noon, when the 
mother of the 6-year-old boy escaped from the house and ran to the Border 
Patrol station, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
When agents converged on the house in the 1800 block of Isla del Campanero, 
they found the other woman and the boy outside, Gregg said. The woman, whose 
name was not released by authorities, told the agents that the smugglers had 
let them go after they discovered the other woman had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said that inside the house, the agents found five undocumented Mexicans. 
Two men were arrested on suspicion of smuggling: a resident alien who claimed 
to own the house, and another man who was identified by the women as the driver 
who took the trio to Los Angeles and back. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating whether charges of kidnaping, false 
imprisonment or robbery should be filed. 
</P>
<P>
The women and child, who were not identified, were being held as material 
witnesses to a crime, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the suspects were not released.

SAN FERNANDO LOOKS FOR WAY TO INCLUDE ITS 'HIDDEN POPULATION' IN 1990 CENSUS

<P>
If city officials and census employees aren't careful, Juan Hernandez might 
become one of the "uncounted" of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez doesn't have a permanent job. Since coming to the United States from 
Mexico four years ago, he has earned his living a day at a time, finding menial 
jobs for $4 or $5 an hour as a day laborer on a Sylmar street corner. 
</P>
<P>
His living situation isn't stable either. A few months ago, Hernandez, 30, and 
his Guatemalan girlfriend lived in a North Hollywood apartment. But they were 
evicted. Unable to come up with a rent deposit, they lived in a series of 
motels until a friend offered them a room in a small house on Lucas Street in 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his problems, Hernandez finds some consolation in the fact that he has 
avoided arrest and deportation by "la migra," (Spanish slang for the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem for City 
</P>
<P>
The success of Hernandez and other immigrants at eking out a living in San 
Fernando and avoiding contact with the immigration authorities presents a 
problem for San Fernando city officials, who are trying to ensure that all city 
residents are counted when the U.S. Bureau of the Census conducts its decennial 
tally of the population in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants tend to shy away from census officials as well as the INS, even 
though the information provided to census workers is confidential. After the 
1980 census was completed, city officials said the bureau's inability to count 
the city's "hiddenpopulation" led San Fernando to be under-counted by as much 
as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
They believe that as many as 3,000 of the city's 20,000 residents are illegal 
immigrants -- the exact number remains something of a mystery. Hoping for an 
accurate count in next year's tally, a committee of city officials and 
community activists was formed last month to act as a liaison between the city 
and the bureau. The committee plans to launch a campaign later this year to 
educate San Fernando residents about the importance of the census. 
</P>
<P>
At stake for the city are hundreds of thousands of dollars in state and federal 
funds. City Administrator Donald Penman said the city receives about $44,000 in 
state and county funds for each 1,000 residents counted in the census. And any 
federal community development grants the city receives in the coming decade 
will be distributed according to census figures -- the funds are used to 
rehabilitate housing and parks and to repave streets. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can prove there are more people living in converted garages, then we'll 
get funding for low- to moderate-income housing," said Jess Margarito, a San 
Fernando city councilman and a community awareness specialist with the census 
bureau. "If we are under-counted, we will go without for the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Project 
</P>
<P>
Census officials agree that counting the immigrant population is difficult. 
"Historically, we have under-counted minority persons," said Jerry Wong, an 
information specialist with the bureau. "Our fear now is that those persons who 
are undocumented and did not qualify for the amnesty program will be driven 
further underground." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, city officials say that if they are to get an accurate count of the 
city's population, they will have to reach deep into San Fernando's barrio, 
where the immigrants' deep-seated fear and distrust of the authorities has been 
worsened by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
Many illegal immigrants had an opportunity to become legal residents through 
the amnesty program created by the law. But the act also established penalties 
against those who hire illegal immigrants and has led to increased INS efforts 
to oust illegal immigrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
The distrust is evident even at St. Simon's Episcopal Church, where Juana 
Mojica and other church volunteers distribute 45-pound boxes of groceries to 
about 150 needy families from San Fernando and other East Valley communities 
every Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Those who pick up the groceries are asked to fill out a brief form but often 
give incorrect information, Mojica said. "We ask them how many people live in 
the house, and they don't tell us the truth because they're scared," Mojica 
said. "They'll say three people are living in the house, but then later we find 
out it's seven." 
</P>
<P>
Mojica, who is a member of the city's census committee, said she plans to buy 
some tennis shoes so she can canvass the barrio streets and talk to people 
about the census. She did a little of that work one day last week, talking to 
people waiting in line for the food distribution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fill Out Form 
</P>
<P>
Ana Rosa Lopez, a 30-year-old native of Mexico City, told Mojica she would fill 
out her census form and even offered to volunteer for the campaign. "Why should 
we be afraid of the authorities?" she asked. "We're all human beings, and we 
have the right to live where we want." 
</P>
<P>
Among San Fernando's immigrants, Lopez is a relatively long-term resident -- 
she came to the city in 1976. She forms part of an informal support network 
that has helped hundreds adjust to life in Southern California after making the 
trip across the border from Mexico and Central America to San Fernando in the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said she has given temporary shelter to at least a dozen friends and 
relatives over the years. Some, she said, have lived in a room in her garage. 
"They put up more walls and fences at the border to keep them out, but more of 
them keep coming across," she said in Spanish. "What can you do? One way or 
another, they're going to keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
Once they receive the form, the immigrants will be asked about family members, 
which will undoubtedly make some feel uncomfortable. For example -- "How well 
does this person speak English?," "How many babies has she ever had, not 
counting stillbirths?" and "Does this person have a physical, mental or other 
health condition that has lasted for six or more months. . . .?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strictly Confidential 
</P>
<P>
Census officials stress that the information is confidential. "No one has 
access to any personal information except census employees, and they're sworn 
to secrecy," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
A complete count of the ever-growing immigrant population will provide city 
officials with a valuable statistical portrait of the city's immigrants, 
including their housing conditions and income. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Fernando community advocates expect the census to show that many of 
San Fernando's residents are among the "working poor" -- such as Carmen 
Rodriguez, a 54-year-old Salvadoran housekeeper. After divorcing her husband in 
El Salvador, Rodriguez came to the United States in 1977 and raised five 
children as a single mother. Her youngest son, 23, moved out recently, and she 
now lives alone, supplementing her income each week with free groceries from 
St. Simon's. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said she earns about $30 to $40 a day cleaning houses in Canoga Park 
and Sylmar. "I have to look for a way to earn a living," she said. "I work a 
little here, a little there, so I can pay the rent and the light bill. 
Sometimes I have to pick up cans from the street to pay the light bill." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez hopes her tribulations will end soon. She has nearly completed the 
English and civics classes necessary for amnesty and soon will become a legal 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of San Fernando residents such as Rodriguez have applied for amnesty 
at St. Simon's Church and at Immigration Services of Santa Rosa, where 
instructor Ruben Coronado Salcedo helps them complete the program's required 
English and civics classes. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado said he will most likely help some of his students complete census 
questionnaires since they already have asked him for help with other forms. 
"Sometimes they come up to me with job applications and tax forms and ask me, 
'Maestro, can you help me with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
The experience of the amnesty program might make the task of the city's census 
committee easier. Many civic and church groups helped immigrants apply for the 
amnesty program. Mojica said the same groups might work on the census problem, 
setting up centers in churches where volunteers will help people fill out 
questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
"People trust the church," she said. "That's why they came out for the amnesty. 
They told themselves 'Here la migra won't get me.' "

PAIRINGS OF CONVENIENCE HELP SENIORS EASE PROBLEMS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Lew was a handicapped, elderly widow with extra space in her Beverlywood 
home -- too much space, she said. She needed help with household chores, and 
she ached for companionship. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Morgan was a 40-year-old divorcee, whose job-related disability left her 
broke and unable to work regularly. 
</P>
<P>
It was a perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
The two women met in July through a nonprofit Los Angeles agency called 
Alternative Living for the Aging, and they have shared Lew's home since. 
</P>
<P>
"I like having someone to laugh with, to talk with after dinner," Lew said. "I 
have that in Rusty." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles program, which has been operating for 10 years, is being 
duplicated in the San Fernando Valley. Jewish Family Services has been awarded 
a two-year, $50,000 state grant to begin a shared housing project for senior 
citizens that will operate from the Valley Storefront on Victory Boulevard in 
North Hollywood. The program, the first of its kind in the Valley, is open to 
all senior citizens, regardless of religious affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ease Financial Burden 
</P>
<P>
It is an attempt to help the elderly remain independent, to soothe their 
loneliness and ease the financial burden they often face when the cost of 
housing rises faster than their Social Security payments, said Dori Gradwohl, 
Valley Storefront's director. 
</P>
<P>
It offers an alternative to living with children or moving into an institution, 
Gradwohl said. Senior citizens, she said, can remain in control of their lives, 
eat when they are hungry and not when meals are served, keep the pets they have 
grown to love, live among the possessions they have collected over a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which officially started last month, has yet to make its first 
match. The applicants, 60 so far, are still being interviewed, and the lengthy 
questionnaires they have been asked to complete are being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman wants to share a place, but she wants her own kitchen," Gradwohl 
said. "That's a little unreasonable. I'm not sure we'll be able to help her." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Capper's application is among the stack of entries. Capper, 62, said she 
recently left her husband and a comfortable house in Canoga Park after 36 years 
of marriage. She got a part-time job as a receptionist in a dental office -- 
the first time she has worked for someone else since 1957 -- and she receives 
half her husband's Social Security check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Time 
</P>
<P>
But her income totals less than $700 a month, not enough to pay her bills and 
support a place of her own. She is not looking for fellowship, just buying time 
until she can get back on her feet. In exchange for low rent, Capper is hoping 
to care for someone else's home while they are away. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to pair the most compatible people, all applicants are queried 
about their personal habits -- whether they awaken early or late, whether they 
smoke, keep pets, watch television or entertain guests frequently. 
</P>
<P>
And although the shared housing staff makes home visits and screens all 
applications, the final decision rests with the senior citizens. They are 
responsible for checking personal references and choosing a partner. Sometimes 
they choose wrong and have to try again. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly not the CIA, but we endeavor to do the best job we can to ward 
off potential problems," Gradwohl said. "And after the match is made, we will 
continue to be actively involved to make sure it's a good marriage." 
</P>
<P>
But some matches, like some marriages, are ill-fated. 
</P>
<P>
Edith Rieder, 76, has lived alone in her two-bedroom apartment since her 
husband died in October. She desperately wanted company, and in May, called 
Alternative Living in Los Angeles to inquire about a roommate. 
</P>
<P>
She offered to lease a bedroom and bath in her ground-floor apartment for $200 
a month, less than half her $500 monthly rent. "I made it very reasonable 
because I wanted somebody to be with me," she said. "I'm afraid to live alone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needed a Home 
</P>
<P>
Hara Berland, 62, needed a home. She was working and living at a retirement 
hotel, but when her job was eliminated during a cutback, she landed at a 
shelter for the homeless. She called Alternative Living and was given Rieder's 
phone number. 
</P>
<P>
The two women met, and a match was made. But Berland said it hasn't worked out. 
She described Rieder as "a very lovely lady" but said she wants a place of her 
own. "I am surrounded by pictures of her family," Berland said. "I am 
surrounded by her things. . . . What she needs is a companion. She's very 
lonely and needs company." Berland, on the other hand, said she yearns for 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But for every match with problems there are scores without them. Alternative 
Living has placed more than 2,800 people in shared housing situations. Fifty 
more make their homes in cooperative buildings, where up to 14 senior citizens 
live communally. 
</P>
<P>
Similar programs operate in Glendale, the harbor area and Pasadena. The 
California Homesharing Assn. reports at least 51 such programs statewide. And 
nationally, there are nearly 400 programs operating in 42 states, up from about 
50 in 1980, according to the National Shared Housing Resource Center in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Cuts 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, several shared housing projects for senior citizens have 
fallen victim to cuts in government funding. Four programs in Pennsylvania have 
closed in recent months. And $500,000 for shared housing programs in California 
was cut from the state budget this year, which could threaten about 20 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"For $500,000, we could match thousands of seniors a year," said Janet Witkin, 
founder and director of Alternative Living. "That's a lot of service for very 
few dollars. You could not build many buildings for $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 270,000 elderly people are on waiting lists for affordable 
housing nationwide, a number that is expected to rise as the population ages 
and the pool of affordable housing drops, said Deborah Cloud, a spokeswoman for 
the American Assn. of Homes for the Aging, a Washington-based lobby for 
nonprofit housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need are more brick and mortar dollars as well as housing and rent 
subsidy dollars," Witkin said. "How many homeless old people do we want to see? 
I don't think we want to see any. What a terrible thing to happen in the last 
years of your life." Alternative living situations foster a feeling of family 
in an age when privacy and personal possessions are held in high esteem, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're into having our own car, our own hot tub, our own VCR, and I'm afraid 
we've created one of the loneliest peoples on the face of the earth," Witkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a burden to live with people. We're not accustomed to it. We 
live in couples, in singles or in a nuclear family. And old people, once their 
spouse dies, live alone."

PLAYING IN ITALY: IT'S FANTASTICO; 
</P>
<P>
FERRY COULD LIKE IT SO MUCH THAT HE'LL STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM DROZDIAK, Washington Post 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds like a dream asignment: as much as $2 million to play about 30 games 
of basketball while living amid the stunning splendors of Rome. Tooling around 
town in a Lamborghini or Maserati. Postgame meals of scampi and risotto washed 
down with Frascati. Midnight strolls along the Tiber or in the Piazza Navona, 
where you can encounter some of the world's best ice cream or most glamorous 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Those puzzled by Danny Ferry's decision to shun the Clippers in favor of 
playing in Italy for a year may not realize some of the great experiences that 
may await a 22-year-old American with the imagination to expose himself to the 
finest in European civilization and debauchery, with a lot of time and money to 
enjoy both. 
</P>
<P>
The whirlwind courtship that led to Ferry's snub of the Clippers in favor of 
Messaggero Rome virtually assures him of superstar status in a country that has 
embraced basketball with a fanaticism previously reserved only for soccer. Some 
of the American players who have preceded him in going to Europe have found 
life so exquisite that they decided to remain forever, in many cases marrying 
native women and changing nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
The vaunted style and hospitality will mean virtually all doors in Italian 
society will be flung open. High-powered industrialists, who often serve as the 
sugar daddies of European teams, are all too willing to proffer financial 
advice, investment opportunities and endorsement ideas. With the help of such 
well-heeled groupies, American players in Europe have been known to plunge into 
lucrative sideline pursuits involving the wine-export business, veterinary 
medicine, radio talk shows and the modeling of high-fashion suits in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
On the court young Ferry will discover some pleasant advantages in choosing the 
more elegant and fastidious style of the European game over the rigorous and 
more brutal nature of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
A greater premium on shooting and the intolerance of referees for violent 
jostling under the backboards will result in fewer bruises and less wear and 
tear on the body. That has enabled many former NBA stars, such as Bob McAdoo 
and Spencer Haywood, to prolong their careers well beyond retirement age in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Road trips also will prove less grueling: Short hops from Rome to Venice bear 
little in common with transcontinental red-eye trips, and gondola cruises 
afford more relaxation and stimulation than hotel lobbies in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
With only one or two games a week on the schedule, and a very Mediterranean 
attitude toward practice sessions, professional basketball in Italy almost can 
seem like the sporting pursuit of a gentleman of leisure compared to the 
ruthless Darwinism of the NBA. But those appearances can be deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
If your team does not win, forget about looking elsewhere to place the blame. 
As the prized American import earning a salary more than 10 times that of the 
best-paid Italian, you will be the scapegoat for losing games even if you score 
40 points, pull down 20 rebounds and all but spoon-feed layups to your 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
If you succumb to the abundance of the dining-table temptations and put on 10 
or 20 pounds in the first weeks -- an affliction that strikes many of the 
American players arriving in Italy -- be prepared for serious grumbling from 
the owners. If your game falls below par or your team loses, be stoic when they 
place you on a penitent diet of spinach and water. Or else be ready to dispense 
with part of your paycheck for the hefty fines when you indulge in a pasta fix. 
</P>
<P>
When you play away games against gritty little teams in Sardinia, where the 
entire village is poised to celebrate for a week if the local team can defeat 
Rome and its million-dollar American, be prepared for nothing short of 
guerrilla warfare. Referees will be cowed into whistling you for fouls if you 
come close to breathing on an opponent. Maniacal fans have been known to heat 
up 100-lira coins with their cigarette lighters and toss them at the American 
star. When the crowd runs out of change, burning cigars and cigarettes may rain 
down on you -- especially if you are causing their team to lose. 
</P>
<P>
A smart American player will make the best possible effort to learn the native 
language as quickly as possible. But as you go through culture shock in the 
early phase of your stay, don't be too bewildered when scenes of Babel-like 
confusion surround you. Well-meaning coaches will try to bridge the 
communication gap with their English, and many of the Europeans are 
impressively fluent in the American lexicon of the sport. But don't lose your 
cool when, in the heat of the game, you hear the coach rabidly exhorting you to 
"make breakfast" when he really means you should join the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
If you approach the season with a sense of adventure and respect for another 
culture as well as an air of bemusement, you cannot fail to have a great time 
as well as acquire a great education in a unique kind of life abroad. You can 
always come home next year to try your luck in the NBA. But there is also a 
chance you may not wish to do so.

GRAF WINS BUT IT'S NOT EASY; 
</P>
<P>
TOP-RANKED PLAYER COMES BACK TO BEAT GARRISON IN FINAL 
</P>

Top-ranked Steffi Graf knew she was in a match Sunday against Zina Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
She argued line calls. She shouted to the heavens in anger. She mumbled to 
herself between points. Twice she trailed by two games or more in a set. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she came back to win. Anything else would have been unthinkable 
after the way she swept through the rest of the tournament. But at least she 
had to work for her 6-4, 7-5 victory in the championship of the $200,000 Great 
American Bank tennis tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-ranked Garrison made sure of that. The first three times Graf served, 
she lost -- the first time the West German's serve had been broken in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win the first game off of Steffi," Garrison said, "you have a chance 
because when she is in tune in her game, you know you won't get a chance to 
touch her serve, or a lot of the balls she hits. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing about me is, I am not afraid of her. A lot of people fear her, 
fear the shots she hits. She is a great player, but it is a game, and you have 
to challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison's challenge was a calculated risk, booming her first serve and coming 
to the net after Graf's second serve. The frequent charges unsettled Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept coming to the net and didn't let me get into rhythm," Graf said. 
"When somebody comes in, it is hard to make the point." 
</P>
<P>
After losing only five games in four matches to advance to the final, Graf lost 
almost twice that many in the 1-hour 36-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison had her down, 4-2, in the first set, but Graf won the last four games 
to take the set, twice fighting off a series of break points. She held after a 
double break point in the eighth game and a triple break point in the deciding 
10th game. 
</P>
<P>
"That was horrible," said Garrison, who had an even better opportunity in the 
second set. She led, 4-1, but Graf won six of the last seven games to take the 
match. Graf said the key was breaking Garrison after Garrison led, 5-3, 30-0, 
in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"(At that point) you do not think about losing, but usually the set is over," 
Graf said. "Then, some great passing backhand shots came out of me. That is the 
best point about my game, when I am down I am not afraid to hit them. I went 
for the shots; I am not afraid of losing." 
</P>
<P>
That is something she has done only twice in 59 matches this year and only once 
in six career matches against Garrison. The title, for which she earned 
$40,000, was her ninth of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Graf will take a week off before entering a $200,000 tournament in Mahwah, 
N.J., her last tuneup before the U.S. Open, which starts Aug. 28. But while she 
left San Diego with her 38th career singles title, she was not entirely 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It is OK if you win, still you want to always do well," she said. "I didn't 
play bad, but not (as well as) I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Her perfectionist nature aside, the only real downside for Graf might have been 
the crowd. They were sellouts of 4,400 for her semifinal and final matches, but 
most of the encouragement was for her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was saying afterward, 'We like you that much; that is why we want to 
see you (play) longer; that is why we cheer for the other one,' " Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
Just another part of being No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ros Fairbank of Rancho Bernardo and Elise Burgin of Baltimore won the doubles 
championship over Gretchen Magers of San Diego and Robin White of Del Mar, 4-6, 
6-3, 6-3. It was the first victory in three finals this year for Fairbank and 
Burgin, who have been regular partners since 1986. It was the first tournament 
for Magers and White as a team in several years. "Elise made some great shots 
on some key points, and that was the difference," Magers said.. . . The 
presence of top-ranked Steffi Graf helped push attendance to a record 37,269 
for 13 sessions, more than three times last year's total of 12,000. Graf said 
she planned to return next year.

MILERS STEAL SPOTLIGHT AT UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH JUMP AND LONG JUMP RECORDS REMAIN INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first Jack in the Box Invitational meet will be remembered by many in the 
crowd of 7,815 at UCLA's Drake Stadium not for the athletes' accomplishments 
but for their failures. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Javier Sotomayor did not clear eight feet again in the high jump. Larry 
Myricks and Mike Powell did not break the 21-year-old world record in the long 
jump. No one ran fast enough to attract more than a passing notice in the 
world's track and field capitals, such as Zurich, Oslo and Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
But the day was not wasted for those fans who can enjoy the simple pleasures of 
spending a pleasant afternoon in the sun, even if it is only to watch the likes 
of Claude Akins, Garrett Morris, Will Wheaton, Richard Roundtree and Sen. Alan 
Cranston in the Celebrity "Make a Wish" Relay. 
</P>
<P>
And for some of the athletes, the results were everything they could have 
wished for and more. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Padilla, considered better at longer distances, won the men's mile in a 
personal best of 3:54.2, beating a field that included U.S. Olympians Jeff 
Atkinson, who was third in 3:55.3, and Steve Scott, who was fifth in 3:57.1. 
</P>
<P>
Suzy Favor, three-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 1,500-meter champion 
from the University of Wisconsin, ran the fastest time of the year outdoors by 
an American in the women's mile, 4:27.31, to beat PattiSue Plumer, who was 
second in 4:29.21. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Brown won the men's 800 meters in an unspectacular time of 1:47.50. But 
among those chasing him at the finish was the world's second-ranked half-miler 
from last year, Johnny Gray, who finished fifth in 1:48.27. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Ana Quirot, ranked first in the world last year in the women's 800 
meters, ran the first half of that race in a world-record pace, came to her 
senses on the second lap and still set a stadium record of 1:59.54. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other winners were two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom, whose 
13.22 in the 110-meter hurdles beat Olympic bronze medalist Tonie Campbell's 
13.34, and Olympic silver medalist Randy Barnes, who put the shot 70 feet 7 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
None of those athletes received much pre-meet attention because of the presence 
of Sotomayor, the 21-year-old Cuban who only nine days ago became the first 
person to clear eight feet in the high jump, and also because of meet promoter 
Al Franken's offer of $500,000 to the first man to break Bob Beamon's long jump 
record of 29-2 1/2, which was set in the 1968 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Telling it like it is, one of the long jump hopefuls, Myricks, called it "good 
hype." One of those doing the hyping was Beamon, who was on the scene as an 
analyst for ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
As for the jumps, they were not so good. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, a four-time Olympian and bronze medalist last year at Seoul, had only 
one legal jump, which was good enough to win at 27-11 1/2. Of his five fouls, 
three probably would have been measured at over 28 feet but would not have 
threatened Beamon's record. 
</P>
<P>
The other competitor considered most likely to challenge the record, Olympic 
silver medalist Mike Powell, finished second at 27-5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd helped as much as it could, clapping rythmically for Powell and 
Myricks before their final jumps. Both said they were pleased to be noticed in 
an event that usually has eyes only for two-time Olympic champion Carl Lewis, 
who did not compete because, quite frankly, he did not feel like it. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the high jump pit, Sotomayor seemed as if he had rather been with 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
In his first competition since his historic jump in a meet at San Juan, Puerto 
Rico, he won at 7-8 1/2 over a field that included Hollis Conway, the American 
record-holder who finished second at 7-6 1/2. Sotomayor then missed three times 
at 7-10 1/2, which would have been the highest jump ever in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
So what have you done for us lately? 
</P>
<P>
"I did not have my concentration today," said Sotomayor, who seemed a little 
agitated at that line of questioning by some reporters after his performance. 
"I was not that stimulated and was not up for the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about how high I can go, but I only do 7-10 1/2 about once 
or twice a year, and eight feet is not something I can be expected to do 
often."

RAIDER STACEY TORAN, 27, DIES IN MARINA DEL REY AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Raider safety Stacey Toran, a rising star whose low-key personality belied a 
future glistening with promise, died late Saturday night when his car hit a 
curb a block from his home in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
Toran was alone. Police said there was no sign of excessive speeding, nor any 
skid marks to suggest reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
However, said Sgt. Robert Topete of the Los Angeles Police Dept.: "It's 
apparent that he was not wearing his seat belt." 
</P>
<P>
Toran crashed his BMW 735i at 11:30 p.m. on Glencoe Boulevard. Police said the 
car, which was headed south on the curving street, struck a curb, rolled over 
several times and hit a tree. The police report says that Toran was ejected and 
hit his head on the pavement. He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't appear to have been driving extremely fast," Topete said. "Witnesses 
estimated he was driving about 40-45 m.p.h. That's a 35-m.p.h. speed zone." 
</P>
<P>
Toran's body was taken to the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. A spokesman 
said that an autopsy won't be performed until today at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Toran and the rest of the Raiders practiced here Saturday, appeared for the 
team's annual Family Day open house at Oxnard High School, and then were given 
the rest of the day and Sunday off. Many of them drove back to Los Angeles, as 
he did. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, his teammates began hearing about Toran's death on the news or 
from friends. Many returned early. Sunday afternoon, a hush had fallen over the 
camp. Players walked around slowly, wearing dazed looks. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard at 7:30 in the morning," said cornerback Lionel Washington, one of 
Toran's best friends. 
</P>
<P>
"My phone rang. It was Sammy Seale (an ex-Raider cornerback, now with the 
Chargers) calling. He was crying. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought there was something wrong, football-wise. We had become close, 
Sammy, Stacey and me. We worked out together, we ran together, we did 
everything together. We were supposed to get together Saturday night and do 
something. Stacey was supposed to call me. But when he didn't, I just stayed 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"Sammy said, 'Stacey's dead.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's just unbelievable. You don't want to hear it. He was a great player and a 
great guy. Stacey was the kind of guy you could sit down and talk to." 
</P>
<P>
Toran is survived by his mother, Christine and an uncle, Melvin, in 
Indianapolis, and a half-brother, Isiah, who is in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Indianapolis, Toran was captain of his football and basketball 
teams as a senior at Broad Ripple High School and won a memorable state 
tournament game against undefeated New Albany High with a last-second heave 
from half-court in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Notre Dame and started for four seasons at cornerback, making 
All-American freshman and sophomore teams picked by Football News. The Raiders 
chose him with their No. 6 selection in the 1985 draft. 
</P>
<P>
They moved him to strong safety and began predicting big things for him. They 
didn't have to wait long: in the 1985 opener, he returned an interception 76 
yards for a touchdown against the New York Jets. By midseason, he had replaced 
longtime starter Mike Davis. In 1986, he had six sacks and two interceptions 
and was regarded league-wide as a comer. 
</P>
<P>
However, last season he held out. He got a $1.2-million contract but missed 
most of training camp. He regained his starting job briefly but injured an 
ankle early in the season. After that, he only backed up Russell Carter. 
However, no one, not the club nor Toran, said that the injury was really a 
broken fibula, until Toran revealed it recently. 
</P>
<P>
Toran had been moved back to No. 1. The Raiders were running a new attacking 
scheme, which was going to place a premium on big, blitzing backs, a defense 
that was made for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode over to Family Day with him," said Vann McElroy, the free safety who 
played alongside Toran. "He was in great spirits. Everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, Jerry (Robinson) came over and knocked on my door. He said, 
'Stacey's dead.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'That's nothing to joke about.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Stacey's dead.' 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't sunk in yet. You still halfway think it'll blow over and he'll be at 
meetings tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as a young guy coming in. That's when me and Mike Davis and 
Lester (Hayes) and Mike (Haynes) were going strong. He was trying to establish 
his niche. The coaches were already really high on him the first game his 
second season, he intercepted a pass against the Jets and took it back for a 
touchdown. After that, there was no stopping him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand things like this. He was really working this summer, 
because of last year. Training camp was going well. I think the new system was 
great for him. The coaches really had high expectations for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a good guy. There's not a guy on this team who ever had a problem 
with Stacey Toran, I'll guarantee you that. Stacey was never a real big talker. 
The only thing you remember was his smile. You'd say something or joke with 
him, he'd just smile." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Townsend, Toran's roommate for five seasons, says Stacey was so quiet, 
they only recently began to get close. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked, we joked about things, like current events," Townsend said. "But 
getting on a personal basis, we never did that until he came to camp, last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who knew Stacey, knew Stacey. The people who didn't, didn't. You 
talk to somebody who knew him, they'd tell you entirely different. The guy was 
warm, sensitive, caring. He was everything you could want in a friend and 
roommate. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in very good spirits. Life seemed to be treating him well. He was 
planning on getting married. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I saw him was at Family Day. We rode there together. He went to 
the cleaners to get his clothes out. He said that after Family Day, he was 
going to go home, check on his house, make sure everything's OK. 
</P>
<P>
"That was it." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Shanahan called it "a tragic loss." 
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts go out to his family," Shanahan said. "Everything Stacey Toran ever 
accomplished, he did with extreme pride and class. I would be extremely proud 
if my son grew up to be like Stacey Toran. Our entire organization is deeply 
moved. . . . This organization loved Stacey Toran. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not just a fine job (that Toran did, coming back this season), it was a 
great job. Stacey wanted to be the best. He wanted to be All-Pro this year. He 
shared those sentiments with me. And he did what it took to become an All-Pro, 
as far as his dedication in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"He was everything you'd want as a person -- (pausing, his voice breaking) and 
as an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan met with his players Sunday night to find out what they wanted to do 
about a memorial service and the upcoming schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said he is dedicating this season "and the next two or three" to 
Toran, and hopes they won't assign him another roommate. 
</P>
<P>
On a table in their room sat some football cards Toran had just found of 
himself. Townsend says he'll send them to Stacey's family. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon one of the Raider trainers, Todd Sperber, walked up to Lionel 
Washington and shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"You all right?" Sperber asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing you can say," Sperber said, shaking his head.

CHAISONGKRAN AS GOOD AS GOLD; 
</P>
<P>
HE SCORES TWO GOALS TO LEAD NOMADS TO 3-1 VICTORY

<P>
Only nine days ago, the La Jolla Nomads under-19 soccer club clinched the 
McGuire Cup, symbolic of the national championship. But in the world of youth 
soccer, victory can soon be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The national champion Nomads already have disbanded, and on Sunday their 
replacements won the gold medal at the California State Games. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Chaisongkran, 16, kicked in two first-half goals in the title game and 
Matt Baldwin added a third as the Nomads defeated San Diego Villa, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chaisongkran, the youngest Nomad, travels from Hemet to La Jolla -- about an 
hour-and-a-half drive -- several days a week for practice. He has been doing so 
since age 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it because of Coach Derek Armstrong," Chaisongkran said. "I feel he's one 
of the best coaches in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Said Armstrong: "I think Eric's just about to break out. He's a smooth player, 
nicely balanced with good athletic skills and good control. What's between his 
ears will be the determining factor. We don't know about his bravery or how 
he'll react under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The Nomads under-16 team also defeated San Diego Villa in the gold-medal game, 
7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Two North County athletes led the way in multiple gold medals. Gymnast Ryan 
Barry of Vista collected seven golds, including one in floor exercise (where he 
scored a 9.0), pommel horse (9.5), rings (9.6), vault (9.5), parallel bars 
(9.4) and the high bar (9.2). 
</P>
<P>
Barry was an all-around gold medalist with a score of 56.1. 
</P>
<P>
Kelli Manion of Penasquitos took four golds during the four-day competition. 
Her first came in 16-and-under one-meter diving (325.25). She earned the other 
three in gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
Manion won golds in the beam (8.7) and vault (9.15), placed second in the floor 
exercise (9.0) and took third on the uneven bars (8.1). And she was the 
all-around winner in her age group.

MAHAFFEY GETS FIRST WIN SINCE 1986 
</P>

<P>
John Mahaffey shot a six-under-par 65 Sunday to win his first PGA event in 
three years by rallying to take the Federal Express St. Jude tournament at 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 10th of Mahaffey's PGA career but his first since the 1986 
Tournament Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time since I had won and I think I had become complacent," he 
said. "When I went out there today I wanted to be as aggressive as I could." 
</P>
<P>
Mahaffey, who trailed third-round leaders Bob Gilder and Bernhard Langer by 
three shots entering the final round, took the lead for good with a 25-foot 
birdie putt on the 15th hole and padded his lead with another birdie on No. 17. 
He finished at 12-under-par 272 and earned $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Mahaffey) played well," Gilder said. "He went out and won the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Gilder, the last player with a chance to catch Mahaffey, bogeyed the last two 
holes and fell into a four-way tie with Langer, Hubert Green and Bob Tway at 
275. 
</P>
<P>
Green tied Doug Tewell's course record with a 63 despite bogeys on the last two 
holes. Tway had a 69 and Langer shot a par 71. 
</P>
<P>
Mahaffey went ahead to stay on No. 15 when he made a 25-foot birdie putt to 
move to 11-under, then added a 15-footer on No. 17 and parred the final hole 
for his 65. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel ended a four-year winless streak by making 18 consecutive pars for 
a 71 and a four-stroke victory over Sherri Turner in the Greater Washington 
Open at Potomac, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel earned $45,000 to move past Pat Bradley and into third place on the 
LPGA's earnings list this year. She took a four-shot lead into the final round 
and never faltered in finishing at eight-under-par 205 for 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Daniel had 18 consecutive pars, in 1985, was also the last time 
she won an LPGA event. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same type of tournament," she said. "I had a lead going into the 
final round and nobody charged. It was just a matter of me hitting fairways, 
hitting greens and making pars." 
</P>
<P>
Turner came out of the pack to finish second with birdies on three of the last 
four holes for a 65, the best round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Geddes shot a final-round 68 to win the British Women's Open at Ferndown, 
England, by two strokes, becoming only the third player to win both the United 
States and British national championships.

Tom Shaw sank a 2 1/2-foot par putt on the 18th hole to win the U.S. West 
Showdown tournament at Jeremy Ranch, Utah, for his first victory on the PGA

GILBERT SWEEPS PAST PUGH IN VERMONT

Brad Gilbert, after trailing 2-5 in the first set, did not lose another game en 
route to a 7-5, 6-0 victory over Jim Pugh in the final of the Volvo 
International tennis tournament Sunday at Stratton Mountain, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, seeded third, rebounded after double-faulting twice to lose the 
seventh game of the first set. The victory gave him his second singles title 
this year, the 14th of his career and the $114,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well right now, and I'm just hopeful of gearing up for the U.S. 
Open, which is the most important tournament for me," said Gilbert, who hoisted 
his 8-month-old son Zachary above his shoulders after winning the match. 
</P>
<P>
It snapped a 10-match winning streak for Pugh, of Palos Verdes, who gained his 
first singles title three weeks ago in Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down a break in the third in my first match and my second match," Pugh 
said. "I feel very fortunate to have made it this far, so I'm not that upset." 
</P>
<P>
With the tournament marked by upsets, particularly to top-seeded Andre Agassi 
and No. 2 Michael Chang, Gilbert coasted through his first five matches without 
dropping a set or facing a seeded player until meeting No. 14 Pugh in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Pugh, who earned $57,000, started well, breaking Gilbert's serve in the third 
and seventh games. 
</P>
<P>
Pugh netted a backhand to go to break point in the next game, and although he 
warded that one off, he was broken on another netted backhand. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert remembered the point. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a backhand angle that I thought was going a couple feet wide, and then 
all of a sudden, he wasn't sure," he said. "He hit it, and hit it into the net. 
That really helped. I got a big break." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gilbert switched to a more aggressive forehand that forced Pugh into 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pugh: "I felt like I got maybe a little physically tired after playing so 
many tough matches and the doubles matches." 
</P>
<P>
Losing only one set throughout the $350,000 tournament, Emilio Sanchez of Spain 
defeated Martin Jaite of Argentina, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, to gain the title 
at Kitzbuhel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
After both players held service throughout the first set, Sanchez won the last 
point of the tiebreaker on an ace. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening game of the fourth set, Sanchez had to fend off three break 
points. Then he quickly broke Jaite's serve. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Paolo Cane of Italy edged Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia, 7-6 (7-4), 
7-6 (7-5), to win the final of a $305,000 tournament at Bastad, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Cane, seeded fifth, became the first Italian winner of this clay-court 
tournament since Corrado Barazzutti in 1977.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chris McCarron really knows how to throw a going away party for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Just one day before he'll leave for Saratoga, N.Y., and the Racing Hall of 
Fame, McCarron capped a quadruple with an impressive win aboard Charlie 
Whittingham's River Master in the $100,000 La Jolla Handicap Sunday at the Del 
Mar Thoroughbred Club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a nice way to leave town," said McCarron, who will be inducted 
into the Hall on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
River Master, who beat Tokatee by 1 3/4 lengths, covered the 1 1/16 mile turf 
course in 1:42.3 and paid $5.00, $4.20 and $3.20 in the Grade II race for 
3-year-olds. Owned by Cardiff Stud Farm, Red Baron's Barn and Timestable, River 
Master is three for three under Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice horse; he's only just learning what it's about, too," said 
Whittingham, who began working with the colt during the Hollywood Park meeting. 
"He likes the turf and he's eligible to run better on it next time." 
</P>
<P>
Next time will come Aug. 20 in the $200,000 Del Mar Derby where Hawkster, 
winner of the Oceanside Stakes, and Notorious Pleasure, who won the Will Rogers 
Stakes at Hollywood Park, figure to challenge River Master. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be awfully hard to beat," said Whittingham, who has won three stakes in 
the first 11 days of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
After winning $65,000 Sunday, River Master has earned $101,650 in five starts. 
Last year at Del Mar, the colt finished sixth and second in sprint races. He 
did not race for almost a year before winning a sprint race at Hollywood Park 
and an allowance race on the grass at Hollywood in July. 
</P>
<P>
Tokatee, ridden by Robbie Davis, was in command throughout the race and held a 
three-length margin entering the stretch. But the colt, trained by Laz Barrera, 
could not hold off the charging River Master. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to get it, but when I saw Chris' horse coming at me, I 
knew I was in trouble," Davis said. "I thought (Tokatee) ran a real strong 
race." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron said he was beginning to wonder if his horse would ever get by 
Tokatee. 
</P>
<P>
"I was riding my horse in the far turn and I didn't know if I was going to get 
by him," McCarron said. "But he finally got in high gear and overhauled him." 
</P>
<P>
Art Work, ridden by Gary Stevens, finished four lengths back and third. 
Exemplary Leader, who won a division of the Oceanside Stakes, was a 
disappointing sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Notes 
</P>
<P>
The combined attendance (on and off-track) of 50,516 set an all-time record for 
Del Mar, breaking the record of 49,184 set last Aug. 21. The on track crowd was 
24,435 and the off-track attendance was 26,081. . . . The $9,755,498 bet was 
the second highest handle ever. . . . In her debut performance, 2-year-old 
filly Ten K won by an impressive 4 1/2 lengths in the sixth race over favored 
Viento Bailador. Owned by Glen Hill Farm, trained by W.L. Proctor and ridden by 
Gary Stevens, Ten K covered the six furlongs in 1:10. Ten K must be considered 
one of the favorites for the $200 Del Mar Debutante on Sept. 3. . . Wednesday's 
De Anza Stakes is the first major stepping stone for 2-year-olds pointing for 
the Del Mar Futurity, which closes the meeting on Sept. 13. The six-furlong De 
Anza is followed by the seven-furlong Balboa and the one-mile Futurity.

DANIELS, HATCHER GO ON DL FOR 15 DAYS, TWO CALLED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Just when they have finally started hitting, the Dodgers placed two of their 
best hitters, outfielders Kal Daniels and Mickey Hatcher, on the 15-day 
disabled list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, hitting .342 since being acquired in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds 
July 18, is sidelined with a sore right knee. He admitted Sunday that he tried 
too come back to soon from May 16 arthroscopic surgery on the knee. He could be 
out for the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, hitting a team-leading .322, is suffering from a strained left 
hamstring, which popped while he was chasing vandals near his home Friday 
night. He likely will return within 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have recalled outfielder Mike Huff and infielder Mike Sharperson 
from triple-A Albuquerque. Some believe Huff could be the Dodgers eventual 
answer in center field. He is hitting .323 with 30 stolen bases. Sharperson, 
who has spent parts of the last two seasons with the Dodgers and was recalled 
for two games earlier this year, is hitting .311. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed, and we decided it would be better if I just rehabilitate the 
knee instead of trying to play every day," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' knee was examined by Dodger doctors last week and no damage was found. 
The knee simply hasn't recovered from earlier surgery. Daniels tried to play 35 
days after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back too soon from the operation -- I would tape up my knee every night 
and go out there," Daniels said. "But my first day with the Dodgers, when I 
tried to tape it, they told me if I had to tape it, I shouldn't be playing." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said: "We knew about his knee problems, but 
that was part of the deal. If he was hitting .330 with two good knees, they 
wouldn't have traded him. This was the only way we could him. We're confident 
that we can get him completely healthy again." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, who had replaced Daniels in left field, was upset about a loss of 
precious playing time. "To have this happen at this time, and because I was 
chasing kids . . . I can't believe it," Hatcher said. BILL PLASCHKE

EAGLES USE GIZMO TO BEAT BROWNS IN LONDON

In a game filled with errors common to exhibition openers, Philadelphia 
quarterback Don McPherson and wide receiver Gizmo Williams came up with a 
picture-perfect play that helped the Eagles beat the Cleveland Browns, 17-13, 
in the fourth annual American Bowl played Sunday in front of 73,677 at Wembley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
An interception by safety Tom Gerhart four plays after McPherson failed to 
scored on a fourth-and-goal play gave the Eagles the ball at their 48 and set 
up a 34-yard McPherson-to-Williams touchdown pass play that gave Philadelphia a 
17-6 lead with 10:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
The loss spoiled the coaching debut of Cleveland's Bud Carson, former Ram 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, a second-year pro from Syracuse, replaced Eagle starter Randall 
Cunningham at the beginning of the second quarter with the Eagles leading, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
After his missed opportunity at the goal line, McPherson made the most of the 
second chance that Gerhart's interception gave him. McPherson passed nine yards 
to Robert Drummond for a first down. Then after Cleveland was called for 
holding, negating a sack, McPherson looped the ball into the right corner of 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who signed with the Eagles in the off-season from the Canadian 
Football League, dove for the ball and made a fingertip catch, ending the play 
with a forward roll. He tossed the ball to an official, then did a forward flip 
in the air -- a move that cost the Eagles five yards on the ensuing kickoff for 
showboating. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to learn to play NFL football. He can get away with that in Canada," 
Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan said. "The jury is still out on Gizmo Williams."

IMPORT FROM OXNARD; 
</P>
<P>
THE FORMULA MAY BE FOREIGN, BUT IT'S AN AGRICULTURE-BASED CALIFORNIA TOWN THAT 
SPREADS THE FLAVOR OF GREY POUPON.

<P>
Marceleno Felix's friends often greet him with the question: "Pardon me. Would 
you have any Grey Poupon?" He always smiles, twitches his heavy black mustache 
and his ample eyebrows and replies: "But of course." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexico-born Felix, 55, is master mustard maker for Grey Poupon Dijon 
Mustard at the big Nabisco Brands food plant here. "I get the biggest kick out 
of those Grey Poupon TV commercials," he said. "my friends all know I'm the guy 
who makes Grey Poupon." 
</P>
<P>
Few mustard lovers are aware that Grey Poupon is produced in Oxnard, an 
agriculture-based town 60 miles up the coast from downtown Los Angeles. Most 
think that the mustard -- whose makers call it one of "life's finer pleasures" 
-- is imported from Dijon, France. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the formula did come from Dijon. It's the same formula -- with a few 
modifications -- devised there in 1777 by a Monsieur Grey, an Englishman, and a 
Monsieur Poupon, a Frenchman. Their secret recipe uses mustard seed, distilled 
vinegar, salt, white wine and several unidentified spices. 
</P>
<P>
For 212 years the Grey Poupon firm has produced the creamy yellow mustard with 
a distinctive pungency. And the Grey Poupon Mustard Shop at 32 Rue de la 
Liberte in Dijon is owned and operated by Monsieur Henri Poupon, a direct 
descendant of the founder. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1946, Heublein Inc. purchased the secret formula from the French company 
and started producing Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard in America. The company made 
the mustard in Connecticut until 1975, when it moved production to Oxnard. 
</P>

Then, in 1982, Heublein merged with R.J. Reynolds. Nabisco Brands joined R.J. 
Reynolds in 1985, and the Nabisco Brand's division of Reynolds has made Grey 
Poupon for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Locked in a Safe 
</P>
<P>
"The entire U.S. supply of Grey Poupon -- 30 million jars a year -- is made at 
our Oxnard plant," said plant manager I. D. Neel, 43. "Under the agreement with 
Grey Poupon, we cannot export any of the product outside this country." 
</P>
<P>
Neel says that even he does not know the closely held formula for Grey Poupon. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gutsche, corporate communications director for Nabisco, said, "The formula 
is locked in a safe at Nabisco's research and development headquarters in New 
Jersey. Only four people back there know the formula. The secret is the spices, 
which are blended in New Jersey and shipped to Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
The mustard seed for America's Grey Poupon comes from Canada and is stored in 
two silos at the Nabisco plant here. The wine used in the mustard is a kosher 
white wine from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Grey Poupon is certified as a kosher product," Neel said. "A rabbi visits the 
plant at least once a month to make sure everything we're doing is kosher." 
</P>
<P>
Grey Poupon's sales really took off 10 years ago with the now-familiar 
advertising campaign created by Lowe Marschalk, a New York ad agency. The 
product has become the biggest-selling mustard in the premium-priced category. 
</P>
<P>
In the ads, Grey Poupon is shown being used by diners served by a waiter in 
white dinner jacket aboard a Venice gondola, being exchanged by two passengers 
in chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royces and aboard the Orient Express. The commentary 
is the same: 
</P>
<P>
"Life's finer pleasures. . . . Happily, some are affordable like Grey Poupon 
Dijon Mustard. Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon? But of course."

Japan Prods Auto Makers: The Japanese government has asked domestic auto makers 
to boost imports of vehicles and parts and it might give them another nudge if 
imports fail to rise, a trade official said. "Our request is not binding. But 
we hope they will listen to our request and import more," the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry official said. Japan has been under pressure 
from its trading partners to reduce its huge trade surpluses, in which car 
exports have played a major role.

Japan, U.S. to Start Steel Talks: Japan and the United States will begin 
negotiations in Tokyo today on a new quota for Japanese steel exports to the 
United States, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. Ministry 
officials said both sides will present their basic positions and full-scale 
talks will start later this month. The session stems from a U.S. decision to 
extend the five-year voluntary restraint agreements with major steel producing 
countries for 2 1/2 years. The current arrangement, which expires Sept. 30, 
limits U.S. steel imports from the European Community, Japan, South Korea and 
17 other countries to 18.5% of total domestic consumption. Ministry officials 
said Japan will ask the United States not to reduce Japan's quota, now set at a 
maximum of 8.5% of U.S. consumption.

Delores' ex-husband didn't start out a deadbeat dad. For three months, the 
$100,000-a-year attorney promptly paid the court-ordered child support of 
$1,000 every month. Without warning, he slacked off. "One month, he paid me 
$25," she says. Then he quit paying altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Without his monthly check, Delores' finances rapidly became rocky. Her income 
as a temporary secretary couldn't cover the house payment, child care and 
school clothes for the kids. In exchange for his promise to let her and their 
two children stay in the house, she signed it over to her ex-husband. But a 
year later he served her with eviction papers and a statement denying any past 
due support. When her 9-year-old daughter saw the eviction notice tacked to the 
garage door, she cried, "Mom, Daddy's making us leave!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chasing the Checks 
</P>
<P>
For seven grueling years, the single working mother chased after support 
checks. She contacted attorney after attorney. Some refused her case on grounds 
they knew her husband professionally. Some asked exorbitant retainer fees. 
Nothing seemed to help. Says Delores, who asked that her last name not be used: 
"Every time we went to court, the hearing seemed to be postponed." 
</P>
<P>
Her luck changed in 1987 when she met the self-described Robin Hood of Wilshire 
Boulevard -- Dennis A. Cohen, a former Beverly Hills divorce lawyer who now 
specializes in collecting child support. (Cohen's new newsletter, The Robin 
Hood Report, is a collection of client success stories and advice.) Cohen got a 
court hearing, proved that Delores' ex-husband owed thousands of dollars and 
collected $32,000 in overdue support. A second payment of $70,000 is due early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years since he founded the Center for the Enforcement of Family 
Support, Cohen and his band of seven merry men and women have collected $8 
million in overdue child and spousal support payments. Some were hefty 
five-figure sums, others just a few thousand dollars (though still sorely 
needed). "We take from the deadbeat dads and give to their families," says 
Cohen, who observes that nearly all of his clients are women. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles District Attorney's office wholeheartedly supports Cohen's 
alternative collection center. The District Attorney's collection services are 
free but the process can be slow. "There are a 
</P>
<P>
lot of cases -- about 250,000 -- and about 600 people to work on them," says 
Wayne Doss, assistant director of the Bureau of Family Support Operations in 
the D.A.'s office. "Cohen's work complements our own. He's helping to get a 
handle on the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's own clients talk about him in terms usually reserved for those rare 
pediatricians who return midnight telephone calls. "I've finally got an 
advocate," sighs Suzan Fender, a Seattle teacher whose ex-husband owes her 
$75,000. Says Nadya Batchelor, a former client who received $40,000 in overdue 
support: "He's a knight in shining armor." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen could use a solid coat of armor for protection. One ex-spouse warned him 
at a court hearing, "You don't know what I can do to you." Minutes later a 
passer-by rushed into the building yelling, "Anyone here own an RX-7? It's on 
fire." Another parent mailed him a drawing of a hand with the longest finger 
pointing upward. An ex-cop shoved him against the wall before a hearing. And 
he's received scores of death threats, 
</P>
<P>
along with fervent promises to rearrange his anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who doesn't disclose his home address, copes with the job stress by 
relying on physical activity. He sails, rollerskates and dances every chance he 
gets. (His red dancing shoes are legendary around the office. At last count, he 
owned four pairs.) Even at work he looks like he stepped out of GQ. During a 
recent interview at his Wilshire Boulevard office, the 43-year-old attorney 
wore fashionably baggy khaki trousers, a maroon rayon shirt and leather 
sandals. Suits and ties, he explains, are only for court days. "Clothes should 
be fun," the attorney says, showing off pink and green socks. 
</P>
<P>
Office camaraderie helps, too, to relieve tensions. His partner Keith Clemens 
needles Cohen by politely interrupting the interview to introduce himself as 
the guy in the office who wears a tie but no red shoes. It's a zany office with 
an informal atmosphere, given to gleeful outbursts. "At any time, you might 
hear someone yelling, 'Yay, we got him,' " Cohen laughs. 
</P>
<P>
But he knows his clients' lives are far from fun. Here are the grim statistics: 
</P>
<P>
* One of four mothers with a court order for child support won't see a dime, 
according to Census Bureau figures. 
</P>
<P>
* Men pay more for monthly car payments than child support, according to a 
Denver Law Journal study. 
</P>
<P>
* Men with high incomes don't pay their share any more frequently than men with 
lower incomes, several studies show. 
</P>
<P>
* While $11 billion in child support was owed in 1985, only $7 billion was ever 
collected, according to the latest available Census Bureau statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-husbands don't pay, Cohen believes, largely because the system is too lax. 
"Men think they have a choice," Cohen fumes. "If we had a choice about paying 
taxes, how many people do you think would pay?" The attorney has suggested 
legislation that would attach a penalty for each delinquent payment, 
</P>
<P>
similar to the charges levied on bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen dismisses the notion that men don't pay because they are denied 
visitation, a charge frequently made by fathers' rights groups. "Maybe 1 in 10 
fathers has a legitimate beef about visitation," Cohen says, citing several 
studies. "But 65% of the mothers wish the fathers were more actively involved 
in their kids' lives." 
</P>
<P>
To collect the past-due money, Cohen and his staff rely on some classic 
private-eye tricks. "If a guy is working for General Motors, it's pretty easy 
to garnish his wages," Cohen says. "But if he's self-employed, you have to find 
his assets." No problem for Cohen. "Suppose the ex-spouse is a (self-employed) 
hairdresser," he says. "We send a friend of the client in to get her hair cut. 
When her check clears, we know where the bank account is. Then we can seize 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Trapping a pool cleaner was a bit more convoluted. "We had someone follow him 
and copy down the addresses (of customers)," says Cohen. "Then we got the 
customers' names and served them writs of execution, asking them to pay any 
money they owed the pool man to the sheriff instead. It got his attention. 
Customers said, 'You don't take care of your kids? I'm going to find a new pool 
man.' " 
</P>
<P>
Persistence is the name of the game. Clemens, a former law school classmate who 
teamed up with Cohen four years ago, remembers one delinquent dad who didn't 
seem to have any assets at all. "Finally, we discovered he had a motorcycle," 
Clemens recalls. "We had the sheriff take the motorcycle. To get the bike back, 
he paid the sheriff $11,000 in overdue support. When he didn't pay again, the 
sheriff took the bike once more. Again he paid up. Now the kid's almost 18, so 
the father's not paying anymore." Will Clemens take the bike one last time? "No 
comment," he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Contingency Basis 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's tactics rile not only delinquent fathers. Some child advocates accuse 
him of taking money away from the kids as well. Though Cohen only charges $35 
to start a case, he works on a contingency basis, asking clients to pay him 
fully one-third of the past-due child support they collect. However, other 
private lawyers charge roughly the same. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Jensen, a divorced mother and the founder of the nonprofit Assn. for 
Children for Enforcement of Support in Toledo, Ohio, advises parents not to pay 
contingency fees. She opposes them because "they take the child support money 
to pay for the service." Instead, she believes the government should take a 
more active role in helping parents collect, and parents should band together 
in advocacy groups to improve government collection action. 
</P>
<P>
But Sue Speir, a divorced mother of two who directs Single Parents United 'N 
Kids (SPUNK), routinely sends clients over to Cohen. "They're more successful 
than the D.A.'s office. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
"As I see it, this problem has gotten out of hand," says Cohen, who also offers 
his services on an hourly basis. (But most mothers can't afford up-front fees.) 
"Nearly half of my clients have already been to the district attorney for help 
(and not collected). They say two-thirds is better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen hopes to popularize his collection model. He plans to set up a national 
network of attorneys who devote a significant part of their practices to child 
support collection. "I've already developed the computer software to help them 
start up the business," Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
(Cohen already has competition. A San Antonio business firm is franchising 
collection agencies around the country. There are now seven in operation; an 
eighth will open in Glendale this fall.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Child of Divorce 
</P>
<P>
Why does Cohen relish work shunned by many of his more status-conscious 
colleagues? One impetus is his own experience as a child of divorce. Although 
his own divorce was amicable, his parents' pattern put him on an emotional 
roller coaster for years. They divorced first during Cohen's junior high days, 
remarried and divorced again while he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Cohen got into the specialty practice only by accident. A UCLA law 
school graduate, Cohen was working for a Beverly Hills law firm, doing divorce 
and personal injury lawsuits, when he first met Nadya Batchelor who came in 
seeking back support. After a brief interview, he recommended that the firm 
turn down the case because it would be too time-consuming and unprofitable. 
"But the senior partner took the case," Cohen recalls with a smirk, "and 
promptly assigned it to me." Cohen was so radicalized by the problems of child 
support collection that he eventually left the firm to found his center. 
Batchelor became his client again a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Cohen's clients come to him after years of trying to tough it out on 
their own. Cohen suggests, ever so gently, a different point of view. "Mothers 
owe it to their kids to collect, no matter how bastardly the ex has acted," 
says Cohen. "I'm not out to kill the dads, but to empower the moms to go after 
support due them." 
</P>
<P>
Suzan Fender, the Seattle mother owed more than $80,000, learned Cohen's lesson 
well: "A part of me said, 'Cut your losses.' But the other part said, 'This is 
money due my children.' " 
</P>
<P>
When some women hire Cohen, their ex-spouses respond with threats. One 
ex-husband said, "If you come after me for support, the kids will never see me 
again." 
</P>
<P>
But often the reverse happens. "When a delinquent dad starts paying," Cohen 
says, "the relationship with the kids is often normalized. I had a case of one 
deliquent father who hadn't seen his child in three years, vowing to go to jail 
before he'd pay a penny. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the sheriff's office seize his Corvette. The man paid up his past-due 
child support to reclaim his car, calmed down and reasoned: 'If I'm going to 
pay support, I might as well see the kid.' As a result, the two have developed 
a good relationship. The child has a dad, the dad has a son and the mom's 
getting the help she needs." Cohen beams: "Now that's a success on all grounds. 
It's nice to wear a white hat."

As he strides through the auspicious halls of Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; 
Scripps, Timothy R. Pestotnik seems to epitomize the yuppified young associate 
attorney on the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
He buttons power-red suspenders over a crisp white shirt. He drives a Porsche 
Carerra -- sometimes faster than he should, friends say. He loves to blast rock 
'n' roll music and owns a house with an ocean view in Cardiff, all the better 
for warp-speed Porsche trips downtown every morning. 
</P>
<P>
He lunches at Rainwater's, where all the waiters know his name. He's 28 years 
old and likes to spend what little free time he has sailing, playing volleyball 
or working on his car. Yet on any given evening, you probably won't find 
Pestotnik wining and dining potential clients, or pricing new stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, the young attorney will be sitting in a local hospital, helping a 
dying AIDS patient draft a will. Or answering legal questions for that 
patient's family. Or speaking at a charity or club event about the many 
discrimination problems AIDS patients face, whether someone is canceling their 
medical insurance or refusing to rent them an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
For Pestotnik, this is more than the pro bono, or free, legal work attorneys 
are expected to perform as part of their public duty. This is a mission. 
</P>
<P>
At an age when many young lawyers living the good life in Southern California 
would be happy with the Porsche and the house at the beach, Pestotnik wants 
things money can't buy. He wants to change things, to help people. And he has. 
</P>
<P>
During his three years in San Diego, Tim Pestotnik has helped halt 
discrimination against victims of AIDS in San Diego. He helped write San 
Diego's AIDS Anti-Discrimination Ordinance and was instrumental in winning its 
7-1 passage through the City Council in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That law was tested last month and Pestotnik's efforts were rewarded. A 
chiropractor in Hillcrest, Dr. Joseph Cicmanec, agreed to pay $5,000 for 
refusing to treat Robert E. Walsh, who is dying of AIDS. More important, say 
those in San Diego's gay community, other AIDS patients, and Pestotnik, is the 
judge's decree that the chiropractor no longer refuse to treat people with 
AIDS. They see the ruling as a victory over discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation Pestotnik authored might have been written and passed without 
the attorney's help, says longtime gay activist Rick Moore, "but it would have 
taken longer and it wouldn't have been as good." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say anything about Tim that doesn't sound unbelieveable. He is 
kind of unbelieveable," says Moore, who has worked with him at the San Diego 
AIDS Project. "A hot shot attorney who, for personal reasons, has chosen to 
direct his activist energies in our direction. Thank heaven. We can use the 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Such adulation and influence might turn the head of a young attorney. Big egos 
are seldom scarce in law firms, after all. Pestotnik, however, does anything 
but puff himself up. Instead, he explains why he preferred settling the case 
rather than taking the issue to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I do AIDS litigation is not to nail people to the wall," he says, 
looking out his 15th-floor office window at the ships on San Diego Bay. "It is 
purely to prevent people from discriminating." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Pestotnik's father died of AIDS. When he learned of his 
father's condition, Pestotnik immediately flew home to Colorado from 
Washington, D.C., where he was in his third year of law school at American 
University. He arrived to find an emotionally and legally complex situation. 
</P>
<P>
While doctors could provide no cure and little hope, the family's attorney was 
able to sort through many problems with Tim, his mother, and five brothers and 
sisters. His own experience with his father's death prompted him to volunteer 
with the San Diego AIDS Project soon after he arrived in San Diego to start 
work at Luce, Forward in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He helped create the Project's free legal clinic, is now president of the 
organization's board, and does free legal work for AIDS victims and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Backing his endeavors, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, is the staid downtown law 
firm, Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps. "I suppose it's an issue that just 
naturally raises questions as to why a person or a firm would be involved with 
it," admits Chuck Hellerich, the managing partner of San Diego's oldest and 
second-largest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
One client did question the firm's decision to contribute its resources to 
Pestotnik's campaign. But the firm didn't back off its commitment to the cause 
and managed to retain the client. 
</P>
<P>
Like most big law firms Luce, Forward encourages its attorneys to do legal work 
for worthy causes, such as helping the homeless or indigent who need legal 
representation. Attorneys are asked to donate 400 free hours a year, beyond the 
1,850 hours they must bill to clients. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising is that a firm as old and established as Luce, Forward would 
commit itself to the controversies surrounding AIDS in a conservative city like 
San Diego. Hellerich says it was Pestotnik's intense and persistent interest, 
energy and commitment to resolving the problems faced by AIDS victims that 
inspired he and the firm's other partners to back Pestotnik's cause. 
</P>
<P>
"He challenges the firm, he energizes a real commitment, and that's a positive 
thing . . . over the long haul, that comes back as a benefit to the firm. It 
underscores the firm's dedication to the community." 
</P>
<P>
For Pestotnik, the choice to lend his time to AIDS victims grew directly out of 
the problems he faced when his father died. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to use my legal training to help people with the disease, and 
particularly their families who were being left behind. My family was left 
behind, and I noticed that there were a lot of things a lawyer could do for a 
family at that time, that the doctors couldn't do. The doctors kind of throw up 
their hands many times . . . the lawyers often can give the family and the 
patient a sense of dignity and a sense of control that they miss very dearly." 
</P>
<P>
Tim will answer questions about anything regarding AIDS, the laws surrounding 
it, and his personal views about the disease and its implications to society. 
</P>
<P>
But he won't talk about his father's death. "That's where I draw the line," he 
says firmly. Perhaps his fervent work to help the incurably dying is a way to 
deal with his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think it is a way to work it through," he says. "I just saw 
this tremendous need. Death is something that takes a lifetime to work through. 
I think you think about it every now and then, but I don't really struggle with 
it anymore. I think you just go on." 
</P>
<P>
Around the office, Pestotnik's colleagues call him "Boy Wonder." Another friend 
says she's heard him referred to as "The Saint." The latter suits the former 
alter boy, who speaks liberally about his Catholic upbringing, and has a wooden 
plaque bearing a cross tacked to the wall of his office near the door. 
</P>
<P>
"My upbringing, my Christian values teach me that doing something for people in 
need is what I should be doing. I don't think Jesus was kidding when he washed 
the feet of the lepers. I think that we all need to be doing something." 
</P>
<P>
He tries to downplay the notoriety he's achieved through his work with the AIDS 
Project. If anything, he seems wide-eyed and amazed about what has happened and 
that he's had a part in it at all. Although the recent settlement set legal 
precedent regarding how AIDS patients are treated not only in San Diego, but 
throughout the state, Pestotnik blanches at taking credit. 
</P>
<P>
"So you've become an expert on this stuff?" asked one visitor recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say that." 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't consider yourself an expert on all this?" 
</P>
<P>
He stammers. "Well, I work in it a lot. But I don't want to use that word to 
describe myself. I will tell you that others have used it frequently to 
describe me when I get up to talk about AIDS and the law. Because there are so 
few people doing this kind of work today." 
</P>
<P>
After talking with Pestotnik and listening to his friends, you start to wonder 
if this guy is for real. Even his friends aren't above wondering. But the 
answer always comes back the same . . . in the affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in volunteer work have a hidden agenda. They want to influence 
policy or make social contacts. But Tim just gets genuinely moved by people who 
are being discriminated against and are sick. That's his main motivation," says 
Corinne McPartlin, a former member of the AIDS Project Board and close friend 
of Pestotnik's. 
</P>
<P>
Even at his law firm, where competition to become a partner could take a brutal 
form, other associates and partners admire Pestotnik's work, according to 
fellow attorney Dan Lawton, who says Pestotnik is known as a "a cool 
litigator." During a recent deposition, for example, a client hurled water at 
one of the opposing attorneys in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim interposed himself in that volatile situation and calmed things down," 
says Lawton. "I don't know if anyone else would have acted as calmly." 
</P>
<P>
So, if Pestotnik is a bona fide hot shot, and he could spend more time lolling 
on the beach, driving his Porsche and crewing on his friend's yacht, why 
doesn't he? 
</P>
<P>
"We all are charged with the responsibility of our faults and our talents. And 
to the extent that I can try to utilize my family's experience along with my 
legal training, why not try to make the world a better place?"

SALMAN RUSHDIE'S LIFE ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN FRANKEL, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While their captors play with the lives of the hostages in Lebanon, another 
hostage to Islamic fundamentalism remains on the run, living underground in a 
prison without walls, serving a sentence with no end. 
</P>
<P>
Author Salman Rushdie has not been seen publicly since British police bundled 
him and his wife into a car and sped off from their north London home on Feb. 
14, following a death threat from Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Since 
then, friends say, they have been moved at least 56 times and are never alone, 
always in the presence of at least one armed bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat Still in Force 
</P>
<P>
For nearly six months, Rushdie and his wife, American-born novelist Marianne 
Wiggins, have lived in limbo, the reluctant guests of Britain's Special Branch 
security police, waiting for a reprieve that never came. Although Khomeini has 
since died, the death sentence he imposed on Rushdie for writing "The Satanic 
Verses," a novel that the ayatollah and many other Muslims condemned as 
blasphemous, remains in full force. 
</P>
<P>
A wall of secrecy surrounds the whereabouts and lives of Rushdie and Wiggins. 
He has issued only a few brief statements -- one of which, expressing "profound 
regret" that the book had distressed Muslims, was immediately rejected by 
Tehran. Rushdie has granted no interviews. 
</P>
<P>
But small glimpses of their existence have begun appearing in the British press 
in recent weeks, provided by friends who have had fleeting contact with the two 
fugitives. And last week, Wiggins broke her silence to give a brief interview 
to Lucy Hughes-Hallett of the Sunday Telegraph and mark the publication in 
Britain of a new edition of "Herself in Love," a collection of Wiggins' short 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terribly frustrating, terribly lonely existence for them both," said 
Lisa Appignanesi, a friend of Rushdie who has spoken to him on the phone in 
recent months and has co-edited a new book summarizing the events and furor 
surrounding his novel. "After a while you become a symbol of the issue at stake 
and people begin to forget that you're also a human being living an incredibly 
difficult life." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the couple was allowed to live the semblance of a normal life. 
Accompanied by detectives, Wiggins returned to their home in the neighborhood 
of Islington to pick up clothes and books. There were also occasional dinners 
and social meetings at the homes of friends. At one, which reputedly took place 
at the London home of Michael Foot, a Labor Party member of Parliament, Rushdie 
dined with party leader Neil Kinnock. 
</P>
<P>
But those occasions ended in late March at the insistence of Rushdie's 
bodyguards, according to David Lister, arts writer for the Independent 
newspaper. Now there are no dinners, no trips to the supermarket or the movies, 
nothing that might endanger their lives or divulge where they are living. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the couple's isolation has been all but complete. They receive mail 
and phone messages only through Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken. He does not 
know where the couple is, but passes on material through the police. 
</P>
<P>
Aitken's standard response to reporters is this: "We really have no comment. 
The policy is simply not to speak and not to explain. I'm not allowed to say 
anything more." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins had little more to say in her interview with the Sunday Telegraph. She 
said there were times when she and Rushdie do not have access to television, 
newspapers or the phone. In March, when an all-star lineup of American authors 
staged an all-night reading of "The Satanic Verses" to express their support, 
it was more than two weeks before the couple learned of the event. 
</P>
<P>
What they do have are books. Wiggins said she and Rushdie have been reading 
works from the 18th-Century Enlightenment by Rousseau, Thomas Paine, Diderot 
and Voltaire. Rushdie reportedly has been working on a children's book -- the 
one thing that might escape the controversy that has plagued "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The flight into exile has been particularly hard on Wiggins, an author with a 
growing reputation here. As Lister points out, she spent the evening before the 
death threat at a lavish reception marking the publication of her new novel, 
"John Dollar." She even insisted on attending a book signing at a London 
bookstore soon afterward but was forced to cancel an American publicity tour. 
</P>
<P>
She told the Sunday Telegraph that she had no doubts about what she had to do. 
"If I weren't married to him, if I didn't know him, I would be signing 
petitions, I would be reading in public from his text, I would be picketing 
bookstores," Wiggins said. "But I am married to him, and what I needed to do 
was to be with him to make his life go forward, and that meant I had to go into 
invisibility, too." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins was reluctant to comment on the Rushdie affair itself. "Salman has, 
from the beginning, refused to enter into a debate because there's no debate to 
be had," she said. "A death threat is an ultimatum, not an argument. What is he 
supposed to do? To beg for his life? You can't begin a discussion from such a 
debased level. 
</P>
<P>
"We were as appalled and stunned and confused and gobsmacked (punched on the 
mouth) as anyone else. My visceral reaction to tyranny is the same as any 
rational thinker's. I abhor it. But I didn't have any kind of inside track for 
understanding it. I was just making decisions from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support From Muslims 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie himself has had little to say since Khomeini scornfully dismissed his 
"apology" nearly six months ago. He issued a brief statement through a press 
conference held two weeks ago here by an international committee set up for his 
defense. He said he had received many letters of support from Muslims that 
showed the apparent gap between himself and the Muslim world was not 
unbridgeable and that some Muslims recognized the book was written within the 
Islamic tradition. As a result, Rushdie said, he was encouraged to hope for 
"mutual understanding and reconciliation" with his fellow Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rushdie has all but disappeared, the controversy over the novel has 
not. Labor Party leader Kinnock's statement of support for Rushdie's right to 
publish brought a critical response from some other party leaders concerned 
that they might lose votes among their Muslim constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a BBC-TV broadcast earlier this week of a program entitled 
"Blasphemers' Banquet," a spirited defense of Rushdie by playwright Tony 
Harrison, brought condemnation from some Muslim leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast was also criticized by the office of Robert Runcie, the 
archbishop of Canterbury, whose spokesman said he feared the program would 
damage "community relations" between Muslims and other Britons. "There are 
times when restraint should be exercised," said John Lyttle, Runcie's 
assistant.

MARINE STRATEGY FOR TEACHING WAR GOES BY THE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Marines are looking for a few good books. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. A. M. Gray, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, believes that "Marines 
fight better when they fight smarter." 
</P>
<P>
So he ordered sergeants and other noncommissioned officers below them to read 
two to four books a year and directed those ranked higher to read three to six. 
</P>
<P>
Rock-hard drill sergeants will find "War and Peace," "All Quiet on the Western 
Front" and "The Red Badge of Courage" on Gray's list -- but not Shakespeare, 
Joyce or Dickens. Gray's list of 175 titles emphasizes war and its heroes. He 
recommends biographies of Patton, Eisenhower and MacArthur with books on 
strategy by Mao, Thucydides and Von Clausewitz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Combat Experience 
</P>
<P>
The goal, explained Brig. Gen. Paul Van Riper, president of the Marine Corps 
University at Quantico, Va., is to provide vicarious combat experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Training and exercises are limited by money and time, so this is the best 
alternative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The key word is synthesis. You take from what you learn about battles at 
Gettysburg, Pusan or Tet and apply it at crucial moments." 
</P>
<P>
Van Riper has no desire to turn leathernecks into leather nerds: "We want the 
hard discipline, the willing obedience to orders, all the things which made the 
outfit what it is." 
</P>
<P>
He wants officers to storm libraries with the same enthusiasm as battlefields. 
Those who fail to improve their performance through reading will be "asked to 
go to other pursuits outside the service," Van Riper said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray has asked base libraries to secure the books they lack. 
</P>
<P>
Now, will the few, the proud, the brave become the bookish?

THE RETELLING OF FAIRY TALES TOO OFT TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's the big movie this summer? "Batman." What's the big musical? "The 
Phantom of the Opera." What do they have in common? 
</P>
<P>
We already know the story. Like the Greeks trooping into the amphitheater to 
see the latest version of "Medea," we've got a general sense of who the 
characters are and what sort of thing will happen to them. But we're eager to 
see what this telling of the tale will produce. "Tell it again," we say. 'And, 
pray, surprise us." 
</P>
<P>
It's the same with "Cinderella" at Long Beach Civic Light Opera and "Peter Pan" 
at Occidental College's splendid new Keck Theatre. In fact, these are stories 
that we may know too well, those of us who aren't children. Is there anything 
new to say about Cinderella? 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Sondheim proved that there was in "Into the Woods." But the LBCLO 
version is Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1957 TV musical adapted for the stage. It 
is rather sweet and slightly funny. (Cinderella's sisters -- Pamela Myers and 
Kathryn Skatula -- are stupes rather than meanies.) 
</P>
<P>
Enchanting? No. Without camping the story, Hammerstein reduces it to his kind 
of fairy tale, where an adorable young woman learns to follow her dream and 
thereby catch the prize, i.e., the prince. It's to the credit of actress Juliet 
Lambert that we like Cinderella as much as we do, for her lyrics are mush. 
</P>
<P>
The prince is played by Greg Louganis, the Olympic diver. When he waltzes with 
Cinderella, it's a neat but modest one-two-three. He has pitch problems in "Do 
I Love You Because You're Beautiful, or Are You Beautiful Because I Love You?" 
</P>
<P>
His line readings aren't bad, though. We can even say that he creates a 
character: a likable young man who doesn't particularly want to be a prince, 
but who is living up to what his parents (Alan Young, Marilyn Child) expect of 
him. This probably comes closer to real life than the standard Prince Charming, 
and is at least a point of interest in Fran Soeder's by-the-book staging. 
</P>
<P>
The major technical interest is to see how the show adapts to the stage. Not 
badly. Cinderella's friendly godmother, Pat Carroll, turns the pumpkin into the 
coach practically before our very eyes (Adam Bezark is credited with the 
special effects), and Cinderella throws her wedding bouquet to the audience, 
proving that it's not TV. 
</P>
<P>
Point of information: The King and Queen's duet, "Boys and Girls Like You and 
Me," wasn't written for "Cinderella" but for "Oklahoma." It was dropped in 
Boston and ought to be dropped here too -- it doesn't pertain. 
</P>
<P>
If "Cinderella" offers no surprises, Occidental's "Peter Pan" offers several. 
This is not the Disney version (back in the movie theaters this summer) and 
it's not the Mary Martin musical version either. It is Sir James M. Barrie's 
original 1903 play, expanded with sections from the novel. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie was a mother-dominated Scots bachelor who really did believe in 
ghoulies, beasties and things that go bump in the dark, and there's a lot more 
death and sex in his story than are dreamed of in the usual presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being a sparky little guy who always gets to go out to play, Peter 
can almost be seen as a creature being punished for his hubris -- a "lost boy" 
who will never make human contact, will never grow older and will never be 
permitted to die. 
</P>
<P>
The gloom is heavily observed in Alan Freeman's production, with its dark 
atmospherics (Pamela Gross did the filmy setting, Howard Schmitt the costumes) 
and its mournful piano music. And yet Freeman's cast tries to play the story 
cheerfully, the way it is played in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity created problems at the preview I saw, which also had some 
technical problems. For example, John Clancy as Peter -- yes, a young man in 
the role for once -- is as frank and open as Huck Finn. But with none of the 
latent poignancy that comes across even in the musical. It's particularly 
missed when the approach is so decidedly serious. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Walsh's Wendy did, however, evoke some of that character's very 
complicated reactions when Peter insists on treating her as his mother. And the 
flying sequences (as in all productions of "Peter Pan," they are managed by the 
Foy Brothers) are magical. 
</P>
<P>
The new Keck Hall is a beauty, by the way: a state-of-the-art version of a 
European court theater, just large enough (400 seats) to make a young performer 
extend himself, but not too large to daunt him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Pan" plays at 8 p.m. this Thursday and Saturday, and also on Aug. 18 
and 20. Matinees are at 2 p.m. Aug. 20, 26, 27 and Sept. 2. Closes Sept. 2.

A CREATIVE GARDONY AT GRAND STREET BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laszlo Gardony has the look of a mad scientist -- a shock of wild, unruly hair; 
round, overmagnified spectacles; a rumpled shirt, and an arms-akimbo 
interaction with the piano. But he sure can play. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Grand Street Bar in his first Los Angeles appearance, the 
Hungarian jazz musician made the most of somewhat less-than-perfect 
circumstances. Working with a new bassist, Mary Ann McSweeney, in a room filled 
with TGIF revelers, Gardony stuck to his guns and played a set of attractive 
original material from his new Antilles Records release. 
</P>
<P>
The decision may not have delighted the noisemakers who only wanted to hear 
background music, but it was a wise creative choice. Most of Gardony's pieces 
had a distinctly atmospheric quality -- not quite Impressionistic, but strongly 
suggestive of cinematiclike images. Many were based on percussive ostinato 
chording juxtaposed against rapid-fire melodic curlicues. 
</P>
<P>
On the few occasions when Gardony whipped out a pure jazz improvisation -- "Elf 
Dance" was a good example -- he demonstrated strong mainstream jazz skills. 
Pieces such as "Sunrise" and the rhapsodic "Anne's Dream" underscored his 
classical training. After six years of living in the United States, mostly in 
the Boston area, he clearly has found an equitable balance between his academic 
background and the street rhythms of America. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her relative unfamiliarity with the music, McSweeney played a strong 
supportive role. Her brief solo moments on "The Legend of Tsumi" -- sliding up 
and down a modal scale -- provided the perfect counter to Gardony's bombastic 
chording. The other member of the trio, San Francisco drummer Ken Wollesen, 
contrasted sturdy time-keeping with an unusual array of percussive zips, 
creaks, squeaks and rattles. DON HECKMAN

KEYBOARDIST BENOIT IN A CAREFREE MOOD AT THE GREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Benoit must live in a different world. The keyboardist and his group 
played a lengthy set Saturday night at the Greek Theatre full of happy-go-lucky 
melodies and carefree solos that carried little of the edge we associate with 
modern times. Doesn't this guy have any Angst in his life? 
</P>
<P>
If he does, it isn't reflected in his material. Tunes like "Sailing Through the 
City" and "Every Step of the Way" typically started with elegant introductions 
that soon moved into optimistic, major-key themes. There were no mistakes 
during the solos because no one was taking any chances. The emotions expressed 
in the songs were genuine; they just didn't run very deep. And when the next 
number began, it often sounded suspiciously like the last. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Benoit doesn't have the technique to get his point across. He 
displayed ability in abundance on a fast-played, untitled blues number that had 
him swinging up and down the keyboard in a persistent, if not witty, manner 
before supplying a hotbed of chords behind saxophonist Eric Marienthal's 
sparking alto solo. But this kind of excitement was the exception rather than 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Adding further gloss to the already glistening proceedings was the inclusion of 
the Warfield Avenue Strings, whose 12 pieces were orchestrated to track the 
melodies and add a heart-tugging shimmer here and there. Best addition to the 
proceedings was singer Jennifer Warnes, who used her warm, smooth voice to put 
a saintly touch to "Song of Bernadette." 
</P>
<P>
The opening act, flutist Tim Weisberg, was also hurt by simplistic material. To 
his credit, Weisberg, who has a light, airy tone, avoids blowing overtones or 
other novelties like humming into his instrument. But he limited his playing to 
short, melodic lines that gained detail only after he kicked in an electronic 
echo device. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, Benoit brought Weisberg back to the stage for a final encore 
together entitled "Duet for Dorothy," a piece that quoted freely from 
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow." Isn't it time these guys left Oz and got back to 
solid ground? BILL KOHLHAASE

MASTERS OF REALITY: SEMISERIOUS THROWBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Swathed in oceans of dry ice, with the fading echoes of some classical overture 
reverberating through the never-sounded-so-good Palace sound system, the 
Masters of Reality emerged on Friday as semiserious throwbacks to those kozmik 
daze, circa 1972. 
</P>
<P>
While the Syracuse quartet's hour-plus set rambled from stoooop-down boogies 
(is that ZZ Top cop a parody or a pastiche?) to almost-acoustic numbers (the 
trad. "John Brown") to a drum solo (what decade is this anyway?), it was also 
unfocused. Too much arrogance in place of genuine persona didn't help, either. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, this MOR outfit displays more creativity/weirdness (albeit borrowed) than 
the legions of Bun Jovi (or Guns N') Poses clones currently stompin' 'round the 
elephant's graveyard that passes for heavy metal nowadays. Nevertheless, as far 
as namesakes go, these particular Masters of Reality are a lot closer to the 
ol' Vincent Price sci-fi flick (pretty scary, kids) than the (cough, cough) 
third Black Sabbath LP.DON WALLER

CHAMBER MUSIC FROM THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finely honed ensemble playing may be too much to expect from ad hoc collections 
of young musicians. They can, however, revel earnestly in the sort of repertory 
seldom heard outside such gatherings, as members of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Institute did Friday evening at Schoenberg Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A squad of eight cellists and soprano Elissa Johnston reminded us of 
Villa-Lobos' wonderful scores for cellos with an energetically scrappy account 
of the "Bachianas Brasileiras" No. 5. Johnston supplied both soaring purity and 
insinuating zest, straitjacketed and overwhelmed at times by Lynn Harrell's 
awkward conducting and his pressing little band. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, the institute's artistic director, also joined pianist Stephen Hough 
in an unscheduled demonstration of eloquent personal artistry. The veteran 
cellist brought the simple virtues of tone control and direct sentiment to bear 
on transcriptions of two Schubert songs, "An die Musik" and "Nacht und Traum." 
</P>
<P>
Hough, who had played the "Emperor" Concerto the night before at the Hollywood 
Bowl, also collaborated with violinists Helen Nightengale and Amanda Yules, 
violist Vincent Phelan and cellist Amanda Forsyth in Dvorak's familiar Quintet 
in A. Theirs was a performance veering from startling technical crudity to 
moments of real magic, all marked by a high seriousness and vigor. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the institute wind players provided the concert's best ensemble work in 
Gounod's "Petite Symphonie," and unconducted at that. They dealt generously 
with both the lyrical effusions and the circus music impulses, in a brisk, 
balanced reading. JOHN HENKEN

KIROV'S (PROVISIONAL) ORANGE COUNTY CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kirov Ballet has announced partial, tentative casting for its nine-day 
engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, opening 
Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kirov artistic director Oleg Vinogradov revises casting as he goes 
along, as he told The Times recently in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The opening night Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty" in Costa Mesa will be Galina 
Mezentseva, with Evgeny Neff as Prince Desire and Lubov Kunakova as the Lilac 
Fairy. Mezentseva, a controversial ballerina, and Neff were both prominent in 
the Kirov's 1986 engagement at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Aug. 18: Tatiana Terekhova as Princess Florine, and Kirill Melnikov, a 
stylish classical dancer not on the previous tour who is emerging as one of the 
company's strongest dancers. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 19, the roles in "Sleeping Beauty" will be taken by Zhanna Ayupova, 
Farukh Ruzimatov, Yulia Makhalina, Elena Pankova and Vitali Tsvetkov. 
</P>
<P>
Ayupova was a secondary dancer on the 1986 tour and recently attracted 
attention in the title role of "Giselle," a ballet not to be seen here. 
Ruzimatov, known for flashy temperament, has generated much excitement during 
recent tours. 
</P>
<P>
At the Aug. 20 matinee of "Sleeping Beauty," the roles will be taken by 
Kunakova, Konstantin Zaklinsky, Mezentseva, Veronika Ivanova and Melnikov. Both 
Kunakova and Zaklinsky also were prominent in the 1986 tour. Zaklinsky appeared 
in American Ballet Theatre's production of "Swan Lake" in March in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Petipa's "Le Corsaire," as reconstructed by Pyotr Gusev and Yuri Slonimsky, 
will open at 8 p.m. on Aug. 22 with Altynai Assylmuratova, Neff, Pankova, 
Zaklinsky and Ruzimatov. 
</P>
<P>
Assylmuratova, arguably the company's international favorite, appeared with 
Zaklinsky, her husband, in ABT's "Swan Lake" in Los Angeles and previous to 
that with Ruzimatov in "La Bayadere" in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cast for "Le Corsaire" at 8 p.m. on Aug. 23 will include Terekhova, Eldar 
Aliev, Irina Chistiakova, Tsvetkov and Melnikov. Terekhova, a strong classical 
dancer, was seen briefly when she guested last season with the Moscow Classical 
Ballet at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The cast for "Le Corsaire" at 8 p.m. on Aug. 24 will be the same as on Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Casting for the repertory bills is yet to be announced. Vinogradov has said 
that although the company's historic ventures into Balanchine repertory -- 
"Scotch Symphony" and "Theme and Variations" -- are not scheduled on the Costa 
Mesa run, "sometimes there are surprises." These ballets were seen in New York 
and Washington.

NEW YORK JAZZ FEST SALUTES PIANIST BUD POWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Bouncin' with Bud," an evening of music by the pianist Bud Powell, which built 
from the ethereal to the fast and furious, was a delightful revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's concert at Alice Tully Hall was the second of six in this 
season's Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center series. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was all music, without spoken information about Powell, the most 
important piano architect of early be-bop. Powell died at 41 in 1966. Judging 
from the enthusiasm of the audience, they knew all about Powell and were 
thrilled to be hearing his infrequently played compositions. Anybody present 
who didn't know Powell's music was shown a new and wide world of music. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with two tunes played by pianist Barry Harris, who is the 
foremost player of the music of Thelonious Monk, Tadd Dameron and Powell. 
"Oblivion" and "Dusk in Saudi" were introspective, as delicate as a daydream 
wafting through blue skies, ruminations on emotions long since calmed. 
</P>
<P>
Then pianist Tommy Flanagan, whose graceful but authoritative style was 
influenced by Powell, came on to play a brief set, the lilting "Celia," fast, 
cheery and emphatic "So Sorry Please" and "Bouncin' with Bud," where long 
phrases, which make one smile with their joy, revealed Powell's amazing melodic 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Walter Davis Jr. played the percussive solo "Glass Enclosure," which 
shows Powell's classical training. Both the writing and playing style evoked 
stern, angry 20th-Century Russian composers. 
</P>
<P>
Davis introduced alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and said proudly that Powell 
called them his disciples. They played "I'll Keep Loving You," where the piano 
plays background chords. Then they were joined by bassist Ray Drummond and 
drummer Kenny Washington for "Bud's Sure Thing," with scorching solos for 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Powell intended to write for a band but never did so. Davis, trombonist Slide 
Hampton and tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath arranged two tunes each -- bright, 
brassy and beautiful -- for a distinguished 10-piece band for this concert. 
</P>
<P>
Players were trumpeters Art Farmer and Earl Gardner, Hampton, French horn 
player John Clark, tuba player Bob Stewart, McLean, Heath, Drummond and 
Washington, with Harris and Davis taking turns on piano. 
</P>
<P>
They played the spinning "Parisien Thoroughfare"; "Strictly Confidential"; 
"Hallucination," roiling with inner rhythms then sliding into dissonance; "Time 
Waits," with its slow, sad introduction leading into milder dissonance; "Dance 
of the Infidels," with solos for French horn, trombone and tuba, and "Tempis 
Fugit," full of urgent jazz spirit and feel. 
</P>
<P>
Harris forgot his reading glasses and was loaned a pair by a man in the front 
row. 
</P>
<P>
The eminently solid concert ended with more audience participation -- a 
standing ovation.

ZIGGY MARLEY LIVELIES UP HIMSELF IN THE NICK OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ziggy Marley did not wait a minute too long to dip into his father's songbook 
for "Lively Up Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The first few songs of the nearly two-hour set Saturday at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre by the Melody Makers slid by uneventfully, with proficient but 
colorless renditions of material from the band's current "A Bright Day" album. 
</P>
<P>
But the charged rendition of the celebratory "Lively Up Yourself," the only Bob 
Marley tune the Melody Makers performed Saturday, galvanized the performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Melody Makers band is made up of four singers: Ziggy, Steven and Cedella 
Marley, all children of Bob Marley, plus Sharon Prendergast. They are backed up 
by the instrumental band Dallol, which followed up the "Lively Up" high point 
by locking into the ominous, rolling groove of "Lee and Molly." When lead 
guitarist Earl (Chinna) Smith ripped off an unusually raucous solo, the Melody 
Makers were on their way to a set that visited far more peaks than valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The early section had foundered as much on Ziggy's lack of animation as any 
inherent weakness in the material (although the songs on "One Bright Day" do 
generally lack the catchiness of the Melody Makers' breakthrough "Conscious 
Party" album). Dressed in a loose, mismatched ensemble that sported 
Afro-Caribbean prints in black and white on the tunic and in red and gold on 
the pants, Ziggy came across as a distant performer who did not seem concerned 
with making audience contact. 
</P>
<P>
That initial impression may have stemmed from the difference between his 
performing style and that of his late father. Where Bob Marley functioned as 
the shaman-like visionary and projected that spirit to the audience, Ziggy cut 
a more private, Sphinx-like figure who required the audience Saturday to come 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
But he did progressively loosen up; the catalyst was the powerful support of 
his eight-piece band. Smith's raw-edged tone repeatedly injected added 
electricity into the arrangements. Ziggy took particular delight in the 
frequent "dub" excursions featuring the potent rhythm section of drummer 
Raphael W'Mariam and bassist Zeleke Gessesse. 
</P>
<P>
The Melody Makers are still a youthful unit, so the performance periodically 
suffered from rough stretches, such as the melodic fussiness afflicting some 
tunes and the overextended arrangements plaguing others. Prendergast and 
Cedella Marley (joined by a third vocalist) chipped in with sharp backing 
vocals and nonstop dancing, but the group needs to find something for Steven 
Marley to do other than wander around the stage, add very occasional snatches 
of percussion and sing a couple of songs. 
</P>
<P>
But Ziggy remained the focal point. In the ongoing speculation over whether he 
is filling his father's footsteps, what gets lost in the shuffle is that Ziggy 
is just 20 years old. The almost exclusively teen-age makeup of the crowd 
Saturday made it obvious that Ziggy is successfully talkin' to his generation 
-- the tomorrow people, not the reggae crowd that was fired and inspired by Bob 
Marley. Songs like "Tomorrow People," "Tumbling Down," "Pains of Life" and 
"Black My Story" are dealing with (or at least introducing in rudimentary 
fashion) some universal themes and major issues. 
</P>
<P>
Far better Ziggy Marley as a model than Pato Banton, whose well-received 
opening set included a brief cameo appearance by Ranking Roger, the former 
vocalist with the English Beat and General Public. Banton is a slick, 
personable reggae cartoon who relied on a kinetic stage presence and 
interminable audience participation numbers that plumbed the lowest common 
denominator of reggae cliches. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he "challenged" the audience by shouting, "Do you people out 
there believe in freedom?" Way to ask the really tough questions, Pato.

COUNTY TO FEEL THE FULL IMPACT OF PACIFIC BELL STRIKE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statewide strike against Pacific Bell delayed directory assistance calls and 
idled nearly 5,000 Orange County telephone workers Sunday as some managers 
spent the day learning how to be operators and pay-phone collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Communications Workers of America, Local 9510, posted 
pickets at phone company offices from Anaheim to Tustin on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But both union leaders and telephone company managers said the strike's real 
test would come this morning from 6 to 10 a.m. when most employees are supposed 
to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
Monday "is the critical day and there'll be 4,000 to 5,000 members out there 
picketing," vowed Del McBryde president of CWA's Local 9510. 
</P>
<P>
McBryde warned that telephone customers will probably feel the widening impact 
of the strike today with delays in reaching operators, difficulty in placing 
operator-assisted calls and continuing problems with directory assistance. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific Bell officials promised business would be close to normal because 
so much of their system is fully automated. 
</P>
<P>
"You can still call the world -- if you know how to dial," said Gary Cuccio, 
general manager of customer services in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell serves 640,000 residential and 903,000 business customers in 
Orange County, covering every community except Seal Beach, Fountain Valley, 
Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Seal Beach and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
During the strike, telephone repairs should occur within a day, just as they 
did before the job action, Cuccio said, but telephone installations may now 
take five or six days instead of the usual two or three. 
</P>
<P>
Added John H. Adair, director of customer access services for Pacific Bell's 
Southern California region, "if you want an installation in your residence, 
you'll probably be in pretty good shape. But it's not going to be quick." 
</P>
<P>
Though operators, repairmen and other crafts are on strike, Pacific Bell's 955 
managers in Orange County are trained to replace them and another 350 managers 
from the company's Oakland office have flown in to help, company officials 
said. All are going to be working 12-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 of them went to school Sunday in Tustin, Buena Park and Garden Grove, 
learning to work as telephone operators or collect coins from pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's picketing was peaceful, both management and union representatives 
said, but the two parties differed sharply on how many locations were picketed. 
Cuccio cited pickets at eight spots, while union leader McBryde said his 
members went to 28. 
</P>
<P>
The day's only incident occured before dawn when Gary Fleer, a Pacific Bell 
manager at the company's Garden Grove office on Euclid Street, said someone had 
tossed an egg at his car. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio said site managers early Sunday morning changed the locks at all 53 work 
sites in Orange County as a precaution to protect valuable switching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio said that the longer the strike continues "there'll be a slight 
deterioration" in service. Instead of repairing a phone in one day, that job 
may take two days, he said. Also, he said, "if we get some major damage -- a 
tropical storm or a large cable cut -- it won't go as fast. . . . No doubt 
about it, that's a substantial work force we've lost." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, callers who tried directory assistance lines repeatedly had 
difficulty getting through. Calls were answered with a recorded message that 
said, "We're sorry. Because of a work stoppage the operator will be delayed in 
helping you." Several callers reported that it took at least five minutes for 
an information operator to come on the line. But by late Sunday afternoon, some 
directory assistance calls got through in just under three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the strike seemed to consider Sunday a practice run for today, a 
full-fledged work day, when customers would demand more operator assistance, 
more repairs, new installations, and help with bills. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for that event, a dozen Pacific Bell executives, some wearing shorts 
and sneakers, went to coin-collecting school. 
</P>
<P>
They huddled around a partly disassembled pay telephone as instructor Bill 
Spencer advised them on the "rhythm" of opening up a phone, removing the coin 
box, emptying the money and closing the phone again. 
</P>
<P>
But if they occasionally joked with Spencer about their new jobs, they turned 
serious when they talked of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate," said Cecelia Annas, 43, the account executive. "I don't 
think either side will win it." 
</P>
<P>
Added director of customer access services John Adair, who was supervising the 
class: "We'd rather not have a work stoppage. It's really very unpleasant. 
We're prepared to step up and try and maintain service as best we can -- but 
we'd rather be doing other things on a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Out on the picket lines in Garden Grove, telephone operator Luann Nelson, 29, 
agreed, saying she was "not real thrilled" with the strike either. 
</P>
<P>
A single mother with a 3-year-old daughter, Nelson said she was worried about 
paying bills during the strike, even though she supports her union's 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"This job is high stress," she said. "The one good thing is the benefits, and 
now they're trying to take them away."

Before Stanford University student Janice Cobolt can leave on her trip to 
Africa this summer, she must put in one more week behind the counter of a Costa 
Mesa clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the 20-year-old figures, she will have the $2,500 needed for the flight 
to Kenya, which she wants to visit for her research paper in next semester's 
Third World history course. 
</P>
<P>
Cobolt of La Mirada is among hundreds of high school and college students 
working this summer in Orange County at a variety jobs for a variety of 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Some hope to make a dent in next year's school expenses, some want the 
experience and some simply enjoy working. 
</P>
<P>
And in a county where the unemployment is just over 3% -- the third-lowest 
county rate in the nation -- there is no shortage of opportunity for those who 
choose to sling hamburgers, punch computers or move couches rather than trek to 
the beach or mall. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually work doing something I enjoy during the summer to give myself a 
break from the grind of school," Cobolt said. "Working with kids or 
volunteering for the Red Cross are preferences. But this year I had a goal in 
mind and knew I couldn't accomplish it without making the money to get it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Cobolt said finding jobs related to her history major is next to impossible, so 
she opted for what she called the easiest market to enter: retail. 
</P>
<P>
"If all else fails, you know you can get a job selling something," Cobolt said. 
"There is always something to sell and someone to buy it. I am just happy I 
didn't end up at McDonalds." 
</P>
<P>
But Diane Hertz, a cashier at Burger King in Anaheim this summer, figures that 
a paycheck is a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if I like what I am doing; I am making money," said Hertz, a 
recent high school graduate who plans to enter San Diego State University in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it would have been nice to work in an air-conditioned office where I 
could wear heels and dresses, but the bottom line was I needed a job fast, and 
money is money no matter where you spend it." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Holden, a sophomore majoring in mathematics at Cal State Long Beach, 
hopes to make enough this summer working as an assistant foreman at a 
construction site in Santa Ana to avoid working during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked full time last year and took 18 credit hours," Holden said. "It was 
self-declared murder, and my grades showed it. So despite a compact disc every 
now and then, this money is for fees and books next year." 
</P>
<P>
Another student who has found summer work is Kevin Allmendinger, 24, of Yorba 
Linda, who is hauling furniture for the Starving Students Moving Co. in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy working for the moving company because there is no one looking over my 
shoulder. I'm not restricted to the office," said Allmendinger, a second-year 
communications major at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Allmendinger's boss, Tharnwell John Pool, said many students "come back from 
year to year and are usually good workers, but we do have a problem with 
dependability at times. A lot of them don't feel this is what they will be 
doing for the rest of their lives, so they don't always take it seriously and 
often don't come in, particularly on weekends, which is our roughest period." 
</P>
<P>
Still, county employers are hungry for summer student help, said John Haesler, 
vice president of Temp Associates. 
</P>
<P>
"We are always in need of more people," said Haesler, who estimated that his 
company hired 300 students this summer for temporary clerical and computer data 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Glonek, a senior marketing major at San Diego State, found work through 
Temp Associates in the data-entry department of Armour Co. in Irvine. It is a 
job, he said, "in a field that will help me after I graduate. Making money is, 
of course, one of the reasons I'm working, but looking out for my career after 
graduation is equally important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, college students want summer jobs related to their majors, said 
Gladys De Necochea, assistant director of career planning and placement at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We get students every now and then who just a want any type of job quickly, 
but basically most students are career-oriented in thinking and want the 
practical experience that will help them in the long run," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Deannie Lucas, 22, of Newport Beach, a senior majoring in engineering at UC 
Irvine, found summer work at Mobil Oil in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually work at the YMCA as a counselor, which helped my people skills but 
wasn't in my field of interest," she said. "It was a long way to come to get 
the type of experience I needed, but I know it's worth it to start out with 
something in your corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my share of working odd-type jobs, and for my senior year I thought it 
was just time to get down to business." 
</P>
<P>
Starr Lee, 30, a law student at UC San Diego, traveled to Newport Beach this 
summer to work in a law firm for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, but law school doesn't teach a great deal about practicing law," 
he said. "Without working in a law office, you have no idea what this business 
actually about. You have to go out into the real world."

FISH-SPOTTING PLANE CRASHES OFF COAST; PILOT MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A light plane whose pilot was spotting swordfish for a commercial fishing boat 
crashed into the ocean Sunday morning about 10 miles southwest of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard and Navy rescuers searched late into the night but failed to find 
any sign of the pilot. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said 
that because the water could be as deep as 2,400 feet, recovery of the Cessna 
172 is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, identified as Joseph A. Shirley, 42, of Del Mar, was working with 
the crew aboard the Horizon, a fishing boat based in San Diego but operating 
Sunday from Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Caldwell of San Clemente saw the plane go down from aboard his own boat, 
the Leslie Anne. "One minute I saw him circling around, and the next, his plane 
was on its back heading fast for the water, nose first," Caldwell said Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said the plane seemed to be flying at a normal altitude for a 
swordfish-spotting plane. Coast Guard officials later said several witnesses 
indicated there was no fire or smoke coming from the plane and that the crash 
occurred just seconds after the plane began to spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Two marlin fishermen also close to the crash scene said they heard the initial 
radio call from the Horizon to another fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy from the Horizon was really upset," said Ken Snyder of Laguna Beach. 
"He yelled that the plane had gone down too fast for them to get there before 
it sank." 
</P>
<P>
Search authorities said they recovered a flight plan with no entries, a tennis 
shoe, an aerosol can and some flotsam in the water near the crash. Authorities 
also reported finding a gasoline slick at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The weather conditions were clear and the sea was calm with little wind, 
according to fishermen in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Two Coast Guard cutters, two Coast Guard helicopters and a Navy vessel searched 
the area for the pilot and the plane. But a Coast Guard spokeswoman, Petty 
Officer Elizabeth Neely, said the deep waters made the search extremely 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Neely said the pilot apparently had flown out of Gillespie Field in El Cajon in 
San Diego County. But Coast Guard officials late Sunday were unable to confirm 
the pilot's identity from information given them by the Horizon crew. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member crew of the Horizon was unavailable for comment, but other 
fisherman who heard their radio reports said they were all stunned because 
there had been no indication that the plane was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, at Dana Point's commercial fishing dock, many fishermen who had heard 
of the crash were in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak thing," said Caldwell. "We never have any problems with 
spotters." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot who spots for Caldwell, who identified himself only as "Rod," said 
swordfish spotting is one of the safest areas of employment for commercial 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to stay in a pattern and we watch out for one another," he said. 
"We're in constant contact with the fishing boats and with each other. This is 
really unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Swordfish feed at night in lower depths and come to the surface during the 
daytime, several Dana Point fishermen explained. They can be more easily 
spotted by an airplane pilot, who then usually drops some type of dye into the 
water to locate the fish for the crew on the boat. Other fish, such as marlin, 
also stay near the top, but they cannot be sold commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Several said swordfish fishermen can get between $5 and $6.75 per pound for 
fish that usually weigh in at more than 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The spotter planes usually fly at altitudes of 1,000 feet or more and travel at 
speeds up to 90 m.p.h., Caldwell's pilot explained. 
</P>
<P>
But other fishermen at the Harbor said some of the pilots fly as low as 500 
feet and at speeds much slower than 90 m.p.h. to more easily spot the fish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hand-Thrown Harpoons 
</P>
<P>
When a swordfish is spotted, a fisherman standing on a long plank at the bow of 
the boat hand-throws a harpoon at the fish. A wire attached to the harpoon 
carries flotation devices that help the fishermen track the fast-swimming 
swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
"The swordfish swims away until he finally wears out, then the boat just drives 
over and picks him up," one fisherman explained. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell, who caught a swordfish Sunday, said the season has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't easy to talk about," he said. "We just don't see something like 
this in our line of work. I'm really sick about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Caldwell said commercial fishermen in the area were greatly impressed with 
the speed with which the Coast Guard reached the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say enough about them," Caldwell said.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;

<P>
EVEN A VIOLENT CRIMINAL HAS AN INTROSPECTIVE SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald sentenced James A. Melton six 
years ago to be executed for the robbery and murder of a Newport Beach man, he 
told the defendant it was too bad, because he liked him. 
</P>
<P>
I remember being a little surprised. Covering Melton's trial, I hadn't found 
anything likable about him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Melton, a large man, appeared menacing. He glared when spoken to. He never 
smiled or talked with his lawyer. He never watched the witnesses or even 
appeared to be listening to them. 
</P>
<P>
During his death penalty hearing, he doodled on a piece of paper while two 
women who took the stand described in heart-wrenching detail how he had raped 
them. One rape occurred as the woman's terrified young son watched. 
</P>
<P>
During a short recess, I strained over the courtroom railing to see what Melton 
had been doing: He was drawing airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
In many years of court reporting, I had never seen a killer so callous, so 
bored with the proceedings. He did not testify, even at his death penalty 
hearing. Even participation in his own trial appeared to be too much of an 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
But that was six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since doing interviews with Death Row inmates, I have come to know James Melton 
better. And now, as the judge who sentenced him, I see another side of him. 
</P>
<P>
Melton, 37, now says that he had been given such heavy doses of prescription 
drugs at Orange County Jail that he was barely aware that a trial was going on. 
If he did not look at the witnesses, he says now, it was because he had no idea 
who was on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for a successful appeal for Melton is rather grim. The state 
Supreme Court turned down his first appeal earlier this year. Melton's 
appellate attorney, Robert F. Kane of San Francisco, is genuinely convinced 
that Melton was impaired by a drugged condition and that kept him from getting 
a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
I believe Kane is a conscientious lawyer, but I have no idea whether Melton was 
drugged. I can only say that it's surprising that the James Melton I have 
interviewed at San Quentin is the same person his jurors saw. He's an 
interesting man, introspective, who searches for answers to why he became so 
violent. Melton at the trial was dull, mean-spirited, inhuman. 
</P>
<P>
Kane recently asked me whether I would write a declaration about my 
observations of Melton during the trial. Kane had hoped that it would help 
support the appeal argument that Melton had been drugged. 
</P>
<P>
This was out of the question, of course. Reporters are not supposed to be 
involved in their stories. But the request bothered me: Would I even want to 
help? 
</P>
<P>
Melton acknowledges that he has a terrible criminal past but claims he is 
innocent of this murder. Do I believe him? No. 
</P>
<P>
Melton and another inmate had been planning this robbery while he was in prison 
for a previous crime. Melton was found with the victim's car and possessions. 
</P>
<P>
With such overwhelming evidence, and with Melton's incredible history of rapes, 
robberies and assaults, the trial results, including the death verdict, were 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
But a nagging question remains: Did Melton really give his jurors any choice at 
all in deciding between death and life without parole? No. Melton, for whatever 
reasons, acted like his own worst enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Melton's first execution date, set for last month, was routinely postoned while 
his appeals continue. 
</P>
<P>
Melton called me from San Quentin State Prison just before then. "You know my 
execution will be put off, and my lawyer knows it. But all I know is I'm set to 
die," Melton told me. "This thing is getting so close, I figure I better get 
more involved." 
</P>
<P>
If Melton ever is executed, I'm not sure what my reaction will be. I do know I 
will feel a sadness that he probably never fully understood the terror he 
created on this earth. But I'll also wonder: If Melton really wanted to save 
himself, why did he wait six years to try?

BUFFALOES THRIVING ON SANTA CATALINA UNDER WATCHFUL EYES OF CONSERVANCY

AVALON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Propst maneuvered his Jeep down a dry ravine through scrub oak, prickly 
pear cactus and scorched grass. One hundred yards away, dust hung in the air 
like baking powder flung skyward. 
</P>
<P>
"That's them," he exclaimed, squinting into Santa Catalina Island's shimmering, 
mid-morning light. 
</P>
<P>
As the vehicle eased over a knoll, the object of his search appeared on the 
valley floor. More than 50 large, shaggy buffaloes lounged around the foot of 
Cape Canyon Reservoir, drinking, snacking and sunning themselves -- not unlike 
the tourists on Avalon's beach 10 miles to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grunted Nervously 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate brown buffalo cows, with caramel colored calves at their side, 
grunted nervously and turned their bearded faces toward the intruders. A bull, 
the size of a Volkswagen, rolled on the ground, powdering his coarse, matted 
hair with dirt -- nature's version of mosquito repellent. Bath complete, he 
pushed to his feet and emitted a belch-like snort before casually rambling up 
through the sage scrub. At the top of the rise, he stood poised against the 
azure sky. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that most people have seen such profiles only on nickels is not lost 
on Propst, who is president of the Catalina Conservancy. He has been roaming 
these back roads for more than 34 years, but speaks as enthusiastically as 
someone seeing the magnificent beasts for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
A former Montana rancher, he was hired to run the Santa Catalina Island Co.'s 
cattle ranch. But the cattle were soon phased out, and he found himself 
caretaker of the island and one of the largest herds of bison in the country 
outside of such refuges as Yellowstone National Park and the National Bison 
Range in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Than a Thousand 
</P>
<P>
The bison count nationally, which numbered an estimated 60 million in the 
1800s, dwindled to less than a thousand at the turn of the century as hunters 
shot the animals for their hides and meat. Whole carcasses were left across the 
plains as hunters took only the gourmet delicacy of the day, buffalo tongue. 
Still others were slaughtered for sport. 
</P>
<P>
Bison protection laws were enacted in 1907. Since then, the numbers have 
increased to about 80,000, according to the American Bison Assn. Of these, 
about 1,500 are found in California, most of those on ranches in the southern 
part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But on Catalina, the buffaloes, first by circumstances and then by ambitious 
conservation efforts, have been given refuge. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case with non-natives who move to California, the first 
buffaloes arrived on Catalina to become movie stars. Approximately a dozen 
animals were shipped in for cameo appearances in the 1924 silent film, "The 
Vanishing American." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, a few more were brought in from their traditional Great 
Plains home to strengthen the island herd. Today, the buffaloes still get top 
billing in the Catalina Conservancy's extensive preservation program. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1919, the 21-mile-long island has been owned by the family of chewing gum 
magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the Catalina Island Co. In 1975, the 
company deeded more than 86% of the island, or about 42,000 acres, to the 
nonprofit, private conservancy to preserve and restore the island's plants and 
animals and control recreation use. Financing for the programs comes mostly 
from a stock portfolio donated by the Wrigley family and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the wildlife was introduced to the island by settlers and later by 
state game officials. 
</P>
<P>
As Propst drove through rugged Cape Canyon on a recent morning, animals 
nonchalantly showed themselves. A black and white feral pig and her piglet 
trotted up a hillside, a wild turkey ambled through a small grove of red barked 
manzanita and swallows dived onto ponds to scoop up bugs. 
</P>
<P>
It is rutting season, and the buffaloes are gathered near ponds and streams in 
larger herds, sometimes as many as 100 cows, yearlings and calves band under 
the watchful eyes of bulls who have won the harem. At one watering hole, a 
large bull with ribs showing lumbered by. Usually weighing about two tons, the 
bulls often lose two or three hundred pounds this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushed From Herd 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, solitary old bulls will be seen, pushed out of the herd by the 
younger bulls. "See that old guy. He's been in a lot of wars," Propst said, 
pointing out a rangy animal with one horn broken off and the other chipped. 
</P>
<P>
Some live to be more than 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
At Middle Ranch, the conservancy's working ranch, dozens of young buffaloes are 
lured into corrals each year and shipped to ranchers for breeding stock. 
Without such measures, the island would be overrun. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy staff does no hands-on work with the buffaloes unless there is 
an emergency. Herding them is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"You can drive cattle where you want to go. And you can drive buffaloes where 
they want to go," Propst said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled one bull that the staff tried to snare in hopes of removing a long 
strand of wire tangled around his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to herd the bull through the brush where one of our men, a good 
roper, was hiding in bushes on horseback. Well that animal got one sniff of 
what was awaiting and took off -- buffaloes can make horses look like they are 
tied to the ground -- we never saw him again."

As Greg Bell and Cleveland Gary watched from the comfort of living rooms across 
the Pacific, Gaston Green won the first round of the Rams' annual summer battle 
for leading man in a running back position. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who rushed for 116 yards in 28 carries, had the distinct advantage of 
playing in Saturday night's 16-13 overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, last year's 1,000-yard man, and Gary, the Rams' first-round choice from 
Miami, are locked in what could be long contractual negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
This Rams' revolving tailback door, remember, had Bell replacing Charles White, 
who had replaced Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
Green was frustrated with his non-role as a rookie last season, but has vowed 
not to let this opportunity pass. Against the 49ers, he even showed the Rams a 
new wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Considered by some too frail to take a constant pounding, Green countered with 
a 28-carry performance that didn't include a run of more than 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it does show people that I can carry the ball," Green said Sunday after 
the team arrived home from Japan. "I always thought myself that I can carry the 
ball a lot, but those are some of the things that people have said." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson wants Green to work on becoming a slashing, darting 
tailback in the mold of Tony Dorsett. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to continue to improve on hitting the crease between players so fast 
that he can get through," Robinson said. "I think we've got him playing at a 
faster level. I think he looks faster." 
</P>
<P>
The tailback position, shared by Green and Robert Delpino Saturday night, 
produced 169 yards rushing in 43 carries, with Delpino adding 53 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of see them as a tandem," Robinson said of his second-year runners. 
"Obviously, they're different kinds of runners. Gaston's a speed guy, he's got 
to hit creases in the defense and burst through. Bobby is a more physical 
player, an inside pounder. I think the two of them are a nice match." 
</P>
<P>
Second-year linebacker Fred Strickland, who missed the Tokyo game with a knee 
injury, will undergo arthroscopic surgery this week and will likely be lost 
four to six weeks. Robinson said Strickland would be ready for the 
regular-season opener against Atlanta Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland had taken over as a starting inside linebacker this season along 
with Larry Kelm. Richard Brown filled in for Strickland and played well against 
the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The news wasn't as bad for rookie cornerback Darryl Henley, who suffered an 
ankle sprain in the game. He's expected to miss two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve quarterback Mark Herrmann erased some doubts about his ability Saturday 
night. He replaced Jim Everett in the second quarter and ran the offense 
smoothly, completing 16 of 29 passes for 186 yards with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann, who threw only five passes as Everett's backup last year, couldn't 
remember the last time he'd received so much work. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know how you're going to react until you get under center in a 
game-like situation," Herrmann said. "It pretty much all came back to me. I 
didn't feel rusty out there. I felt pretty much in control of things. We had a 
lot of young guys in there. I was trying to help them out. That kept me into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever fears Robinson had about his backup were relieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was very important," he said of Herrmann's performance, "and I 
thought he did it with poise and a kind of calmness. Of course, Mark's a calm 
fellow. I think he establishes that we have two quarterbacks and could continue 
to run our same offense with either man. The thing that kind of haunts you all 
the time, is, 'Oh gosh, if we lose the first one we have to change what we're 
doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
With receivers Henry Ellard, Ron Brown and Aaron Cox missing in action because 
of injuries, Flipper Anderson was asked to take the lead Saturday night. And he 
did just that, with six catches for 90 yards. The Rams outgained the 49ers in 
total yardage, 433 to 299. . . . The team moves training camp to Cal State 
Fullerton today, though players will only be put through a light evening 
workout.

Q &amp; A: DAVID BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
A TEST OF BIG SCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
METWEST IS OUT TO PROVE THAT LARGE HEALTH LABS DO BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The job of developing a major network of diagnostic laboratories in the western 
United States rests on the shoulders of David Bush, president and chief 
executive of MetWest, an 8-month-old Newport Beach company with big ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
Since gaining its corporate independence from New Jersey lab giant MetPath, 
MetWest has embarked on an acquisition binge. So far it has purchased a 
laboratory operation in San Jose for $20 million, and it has agreed to pay $85 
million for Central Diagnostic Laboratory, a laboratory chain based in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was born in London, studied electrical engineering and accounting. 
One of his first jobs was with a British subsidiary of Corning Glass Works. He 
later transferred to its New York headquarters. He worked in a variety of 
management positions in the company's medical products and laboratory glass 
units until 1984, when he joined MetPath in the data processing department. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Bush became that company's chief financial officer, the position 
he left to take charge of MetWest. During his four years with MetPath, the 
company's annual revenues almost doubled, from $180 million to to $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Times staff writer Leslie Berkman, Bush said he believes 
there is an industry-wide consolidation going on as smaller and less 
cost-effective labs are being purchased by larger ones. Bush also outlined 
MetWest's strategy to grow into a major regional operation while striving to 
maintain service convenient to local hospitals and doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. Have you seen changes in the clinical diagnostic laboratory industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. The industry is historically a very diffuse one with lots and lots of 
competitors. Laboratories started out as mom-and-pop operations -- the wife 
worked in the lab and the husband sort of managed the office, or the other way 
around. As electronics and computer technology developed in the 1960s so you 
could do more tests outside university research laboratories, there was an 
enormous expansion of the business. Some of the big corporations started to get 
interested, and some pharmaceutical companies got into the business and started 
doing lab testing -- people like SmithKline Bioscience Laboratories and Roche 
Biomedical Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Were the big companies able to operate the laboratories with greater cost 
savings? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Obviously the reason big companies came in was because they thought 
there was a business opportunity. The reason they were successful was that they 
had money in a very capital-intensive business. They could buy expensive 
equipment, and they had the management techniques to know how to run a large, 
complicated operation. By growing larger, they were able to become more 
cost-effective and improve quality-control procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why were well-funded corporations better able to control the quality of test 
results? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not only is there overhead involved in quality control, but there's a danger 
that if you're very small, you may cut corners because of costs. Also, if you 
put a large volume of testing through a machine, quality control is easier. I 
would argue that the big labs had better, more consistent results. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have efforts to curb the rising costs of medicine affected your industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. Sure. Reimbursement has become an issue. No longer is the country 
comfortable with the continuing escalating costs of all medical care, and lab 
testing is one component of that. Part of the problem is that there are more 
tests to do. We are getting better health care, but that is not for free. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are physicians being more careful in choosing which tests need to be done? 
</P>
<P>
A. People have argued that in physician-owned labs, the doctors may have a 
financial incentive to order more tests. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you feel that doctor-owned laboratories should be outlawed? 
</P>
<P>
A. It seems to me that there is an inability of the industry to manage its own 
affairs in an appropriate manner and there is a need for some sort of 
legislation to restrict some activities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your laboratory is not owned by physicians. So would legislation against 
doctor-owned laboratories open up more business for you? 
</P>
<P>
A. I suppose somewhat. Concern about doctor-owned labs is not just about 
whether the doctors are making excessive profits but that they are motivated to 
purchase tests from the labs because they have a financial stake in them and 
not because the test results are good or their testing capability is ideal. If 
legislation is enacted that forbids doctors from referring tests to 
laboratories they own, we will be able to compete freely. Our job is to be 
better; and if we are better we will get the business, and if we aren't we 
won't. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there also a trend toward consolidation in the clinical laboratory 
business? 
</P>
<P>
A. We are now seeing reimbursement decreasing, and because of genuine concerns 
about quality there are moves to increase regulation of the industry. Under the 
Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act, come 1990 every lab will have to be 
licensed federally and be subject to doing proficiency testing. 
</P>
<P>
So with increased demand for quality and the increased cost of capital needed 
to buy and replace sophisticated equipment, the increased complexity of running 
it, and declining reimbursement, a lot of people in the business are going to 
find it harder and harder to survive and many people are deciding to sell. Only 
the very efficient are going to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a whole group of independent laboratory owners are reaching the age of 
retirement anyway because the industry started 30 years ago. A lab tech who 
started his own lab then is now between 55 and 65, and he's ready to retire. 
So, for that reason, there's a sudden flurry of buying and selling labs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is there more concern about the quality of laboratory test results? Is 
it because of cases such as that of Central Pathology Services Medical Group, 
which the state recently shut down because too many Pap smear test results were 
inaccurate? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think what has happened is the major companies in the business have always 
pushed quality. There has been a steady gain in market share by the large labs 
over the smaller labs over the last 10 years. I think part of that is because 
they have been able to do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Was Central Pathology a small operation? 
</P>
<P>
A. It was a small part of a large lab. I do not know what happened in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One of the accusations in that case was that the lab technicians were 
overworked and trying to do too many tests a day. How could that have been 
prevented? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is a question of each company's internal policies. We have very strong 
policies about how many tests anyone can do. (Lab technicians) are all paid a 
salary and are not paid by the test. They have ongoing training programs. We 
rescreen 10% of everything we do at random. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it legal to pay technicians by the test? 
</P>
<P>
A. As far as I know, it is not illegal today, and some labs do it. We believe 
we should take that pressure off the technician. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What regulations currently control the quality of test results in 
laboratories? 
</P>
<P>
A. For a start, every major lab that does business with Medicare has to be 
licensed by Medicare, which makes routine inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the state also license labs? 
</P>
<P>
A. It depends on the state. In California the regulation is very stringent. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It seems that price competition in such a cost-conscious market could 
undermine quality. 
</P>
<P>
A. We in fact have made the decision internally not necessarily to compete on 
price. Our list prices are significantly higher than some of our competitors,' 
and we've said in order to provide a product we believe in -- and we can stand 
behind and we can sleep at nights with -- this is what we have to charge. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you persuade insurance companies that they should pay your prices? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think insurance companies are a problem. They understand these 
things, and you can deal with them fairly rationally. The biggest problem is 
with the physicians. But many of them also understand. That's why we are still 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do health maintenance organizations and other managed care systems negotiate 
directly with laboratories on prices? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. Their contracts are competitively bid, and many of the HMOs are 
in financial difficulty. So they are very tough to negotiate with. We have 
walked away from a number of them. 
</P>
<P>
There is a great attraction to an HMO because of the large amount of business 
involved. We have had to make some tough decisions. If we don't think we can 
generate the sort of money from that contract that will allow us to maintain 
our quality standards and reinvest in the business in a way we feel is 
appropriate, we will walk away from it, and we have. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are your corporate goals? 
</P>
<P>
A. What we want to do is to be the premier lab in the West. The way we're set 
up, we really only operate in the western United States. We have a sister 
company, MetPath, that operates in the East. We are highly regionalized, highly 
decentralized and do as much as we can in facilities close to the client. But 
we do also have access to MetPath's esoteric reference lab in New Jersey to do 
highly specialized tests. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will you focus on metropolitan areas? Or will you branch out to rural 
America? 
</P>
<P>
A. Essentially our prime focus is in the metro areas, although we have samples 
coming in every day from outlying areas like Billings, Mont. Large metropolitan 
areas are where we are building labs and making acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will increased size help give you name recognition in the market? 
</P>
<P>
A. Name recognition is important, but size is mostly necessary to provide 
sufficient service. It's tough to service a client if he's two hours' drive 
from anyone else. And so building a volume of business in one proximity allows 
you to be there whenever they want you. It is similar in dynamics to the 
problems of Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who are your main competitors? 
</P>
<P>
A. That varies city to city. In general there are three big guys: SmithKline 
Bioscience Laboratories, Roche Biomedical Laboratories and National Health 
Laboratories. And a second tier of people like Damon Clinical Laboratories. And 
then in every city, there is usually some local lab of substance and size who 
is a competitor. And then there are thousands of small labs, all of who can 
provide in a sense the best possible service because they are usually very 
close to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you face competition in the many new home testing kits for such 
conditions as colon cancer and pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't see it as competition. I think there was concern at one time that 
some testing would move from the lab to the home. But now I don't see it that 
way. These home tests are designed to be very easy to use and to give immediate 
information, but they do not provide a certain diagnosis. So if a person tests 
positive by using a home kit, the first thing he does is go to a doctor, and 
the doctor will draw a sample and send it to a laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing applies to a kit used in a doctor's office. The doctors know 
that even those have limitations, and the manufacturers acknowledge that they 
are only preliminary tests. So inevitably if someone tests positive, a sample 
goes to a lab. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How are clinical laboratories doing financially? Hospitals are on the ropes. 
Is the clinical laboratory industry having troubles too? 
</P>
<P>
A. My guess is that an industry analyst in the stock market would say on 
average it is not particularly good. As in any industry, there are wide 
fluctuations. There are a couple companies that do very well and many who are 
doing very poorly. I think there is a whole segment of the industry struggling 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are they struggling because of the demand for cost containment? 
</P>
<P>
A. I guess the question is whether the costs are too high and therefore they 
are having problems with the amount of insurance reimbursement, or is the 
reimbursement too low? I would argue that there are too many people in this 
industry and there are too many who are too small and aren't efficient. I would 
be concerned about their cost-effectiveness and their quality. So I personally 
think that reimbursement is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So do you believe that the reimbursement that private and government 
insurers offer is sufficient? 
</P>
<P>
A. Sure. We and our sister company MetPath indicated in congressional hearings 
that we would be supportive of some reduction in Medicare reimbursement given 
the size of the budget problems that the government has. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you planning to issue more stock to raise funds to expand your company? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not yet. I don't think it would be appropriate. We're just too new. When we 
complete our acquisitions in a couple of months, we will have revenues of about 
$130 million to $140 million a year. We'll be bigger than Nichols Laboratories 
(in San Juan Capistrano) and a little bit smaller than Damon. Then we will be 
of more interest to stock analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides gaining access to public money, what are the reasons that you 
decided to establish a western company separate from MetPath? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have an independent management that's local. It's headquartered here in 
California. It's not headquartered in New Jersey. It allows us to move faster 
on our feet. MetPath has not done as well on the West Coast as on the East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
It is a mistake for a laboratory company to try to be a national conglomerate 
because the business is regional. The doctor in L.A. really doesn't care about 
how lab testing is done for the doctor in Chicago or the fact that you have a 
big lab in Chicago or New Jersey or anywhere else. The doctor in L.A. is 
worried about what happens to his tests in his town. 
</P>
<P>
So, although we're involved in multiple states, we actually operate in each 
city as if it is an independent market. Each has its own general manager, sales 
force and testing capabilities. And their job is to service their community.

NEW CHILDREN'S PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA YOUTH THEATER CITED AS BEST IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater has been named the country's best new 
children's program by a national organization of educators and theater 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The American Alliance for Theater and Education is expected to announce this 
morning at its annual convention in New York that the Youth Theater is the 
winner of the Outstanding New Children's Theater Company Award. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious award is bestowed by the 700-member organization on theatrical 
programs between 2 and 5 years old. The Youth Theater recently concluded its 
third season at the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Davidson, artistic director of the children's troupe, said from New York 
through a Laguna Playhouse spokesman that he was "thrilled by this kind of 
national recognition." He said it affirmed his belief that "children are 
entitled to the best of all the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Krall, whose work has been performed by the Youth Theater, is also to be 
named the winner of the alliance's Charlotte Chorpenning Playwright Award, 
Laguna spokesman Brian Murphy added. The award goes to a nationally known 
writer of outstanding plays for children. 
</P>
<P>
Krall's "Special Class," a drama about handicapped children, was staged at the 
Moulton two seasons ago. Another of his works, "Draw Fire," will be offered 
during the Youth Theater's 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
The subscription audience for the children's troupe has increased nearly 
fivefold since it began operating in 1986, Murphy said. There were 240 season 
ticket holders that year and more than 1,100 this year. The program has also 
doubled its theater-arts class enrollment during each successive season. There 
were 160 students this year. 
</P>
<P>
The task of "preparing audiences of the future can often be unsung," Douglas 
Rowe, artistic director of the Laguna Playhouse, said in a prepared statement. 
"We hope this award will further serve to bring into focus the importance of 
the work being done by Scott, his staff and our diligent company of players and 
volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse is currently raising money for the purchase of the General 
Telephone building in downtown Laguna Beach to expand operations beyond the 
Moulton Theatre, both for classrooms and performance space for the children's 
troupe as well as for a professional company. 
</P>
<P>
The Youth Theater produced five plays during its 1988-89 season at the Moulton, 
including "The Nightingale," "Barnum" and "I Never Saw Another Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Next season it will also offer five plays, beginning with "Alice in 
Wonderland," to be staged as an environmental theater work at Anneliese's 
Willowbrook School (Sept. 30-Oct. 22). 
</P>
<P>
That will be followed at the Moulton by "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever" (Dec. 
15 to 23); "The Code Breaker" (Feb. 3 to 11); "Draw Fire" (March 31 to April 8) 
and "The Bluebird" (June 8 to 17).

The Kirov Ballet announced partial, tentative casting Friday for its nine-day 
engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, opening 
Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The opening night Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty" will be Galina Mezentseva, 
with Evgeny Neff as Prince Desire and Lubov Kunakova as the Lilac Fairy. 
Mezentseva, a controversial ballerina, and Neff were both prominent in the 
Kirov's 1986 engagement at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Aug. 18: Tatiana Terekhova as Princess Florine, and Kirill Melnikov, a 
stylish classical dancer who was not on the previous tour but is emerging as 
one of the company's strongest dancers. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 19, the roles in "Sleeping Beauty" will be taken by Zhanna Ayupova, 
Farukh Ruzimatov, Yulia Makhalina, Elena Pankova and Vitali Tsvetkov. 
</P>
<P>
Ayupova was a secondary dancer on the 1986 tour and recently attracted 
attention in the title role of "Giselle," although that ballet is not on the 
schedule for Orange County. Ruzimatov, known for flashy temperament, has 
generated much excitement during recent tours. 
</P>
<P>
At the Aug. 20 matinee of "Sleeping Beauty," the roles will be taken by 
Kunakova, Konstantin Zaklinsky, Mezentseva, Veronika Ivanova and Melnikov. Both 
Kunakova and Zaklinsky also were prominent in the 1986 tour. Zaklinsky appeared 
in American Ballet Theatre's production of "Swan Lake" in March in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Petipa's "Le Corsaire," as reconstructed by Pyotr Gusev and Yuri Slonimsky, 
will open at 8 p.m. on Aug. 22 with Altynai Assylmuratova, Neff, Pankova, 
Zaklinsky and Ruzimatov. 
</P>
<P>
Assylmuratova, arguably the company's international favorite, appeared with 
Zaklinsky, her husband, in ABT's "Swan Lake" in Los Angeles and previous to 
that with Ruzimatov in "La Bayadere" in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cast for "Le Corsaire" at 8 p.m. on Aug. 23 will include Terekhova, Eldar 
Aliev, Irina Chistiakova, Tsvetkov and Melnikov. Terekhova, a strong classical 
dancer, was seen briefly when she was a guest last season with the Moscow 
Classical Ballet at the Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The cast for "Le Corsaire" at 8 p.m. on Aug. 24 will be the same as on Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Casting for the mixed-repertory bills will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Some casting may change once the Kirov arrives, however, because artistic 
director Oleg Vinogradov revises casting as he goes along, as he told The Times 
music and dance critic Martin Bernheimer recently in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov also told Bernheimer that although the company's historic ventures 
into Balanchine repertory -- "Scotch Symphony" and "Theme and Variations" -- 
are not scheduled on the Costa Mesa run, "sometimes there are surprises." These 
ballets were seen in New York and Washington.

The trial in an unprecedented custody battle over seven frozen embryos opened 
today with lawyers debating whether the mother has the right to bear the 
"test-tube babies" against the father's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sue Davis, 28, contends that the embryos created through in vitro 
fertilization are "pre-born children" and she wants the right to have them 
implanted in her womb. Her estranged husband, Junior Davis, 30, argues that use 
of the fertilized eggs held in frozen storage would force him into unwanted 
fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
Davis won a temporary court order against his wife's use of the eggs after 
filing for divorce in February to end their nine-year marriage. He told 
reporters that he does not want his children to suffer the pain of a broken 
home.

The FBI said today that its experts believe the body hanging from a rope in a 
videotape released last week by Lebanese terrorists is likely that of hostage 
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, but offered no judgment about the time and 
cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
An agency statement said "a judgment has been made within a reasonable degree 
of medical certainty that the person depicted in the videotape is dead." 
</P>
<P>
"Although a positive identification could not be made, numerous observable 
characteristics were noted, indicating that the person depicted in the 
videotape is Higgins," the FBI said. "This judgment was made by forensic 
experts and pathologists." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the only way 
the FBI could deliver a completely positive identification would be to have 
Higgins' remains or other physical evidence, such as fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, head of a 75-member U.N. peacekeeping team, was kidnaped in south 
Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988. His captors claimed last Monday that he had been 
hanged in retaliation for Israel's refusal to release a kidnaped Muslim cleric. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of a figure, hanging by his neck, bound and gagged, was released 
that day.

U.N. OFFICIAL SEES NEW HOPE ON HOSTAGES; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH REPORTED 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' BUT LONG WAIT IS EXPECTED

A senior U.N. official said today after meeting with Muslim leaders that 
"circumstances might be more conducive" to resolve the problem of Western 
hostages held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush's chief spokesman said Bush is "cautiously 
optimistic" that American hostages will gain their freedom but added, "It's 
probably going to be a longer period of time rather than shorter." 
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said proposals to free hostages have come from 
countries that include Iran, Syria, Algeria, and Israel in addition to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Undersecretary General Marrack Goulding said a solution could come about 
only "through a long process of quiet and patient diplomacy" in which many 
governments and organizations would have to take part. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Israel, which July 28 seized a Muslim cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim 
Obeid, reiterated today that there will be no exchange of captives unless three 
Israeli servicemen are part of the swap. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get the Israelis, there won't be a deal," said Israeli Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Alon Liel in Jerusalem. Right-wing legislators also called 
for retaliation if any Israelis were harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Kidnapers holding U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio on Sunday offered to release him 
immediately if Israel frees Obeid and 450 Arab prisoners and allows 55 
Palestinian deportees to return home. 
</P>
<P>
Goulding spoke after two meetings he held in West Beirut with acting Muslim 
Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide 
of Hezbollah, or Party of God. 
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim fundamentalist party is believed to be the umbrella group for 
pro-Iranian extremist factions holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leader Hussein Mousawi said an Israeli soldier his group holds could 
be killed if Obeid is not released. 
</P>
<P>
Goulding, who heads U.N. peacekeeping operations, said he will fly back to New 
York "fairly soon" to report to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say without claiming to be optimistic, this is something that many 
people have said to me, that there are certain tendencies, certain trends in 
the international climate which suggest that circumstances may be more 
conducive to a settlement to the hostages problem now than they have been 
sometime in the past," he said without elaborating.

Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) began a monthlong congressional recess today on a 
honeymoon with his new wife. 
</P>
<P>
Udall's office announced that the 67-year-old congressman was married to Norma 
Gilbert in a private ceremony Sunday in the Prayer Room of the Capitol. The 
couple then left for their honeymoon in the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Gilbert Udall is a Los Angeles native who has worked as a lobbyist and 
congressional staff member in the capital for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the congressman said the new Mrs. Udall is keeping her age a secret. 
"She said she doesn't want to go through life with her name always appearing in 
print followed by a comma and her age," Udall spokesman Erik Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Udall's first wife, Ella, with whom he had six children, died Aug. 13, 1988.

Much of the eastern two-thirds of the nation cooled off today after a heat wave 
that toppled temperature records in at least eight states. 
</P>
<P>
The summer break was most apparent for residents in the north-central United 
States, where temperatures early today were generally in the 50s and upper 40s. 
</P>
<P>
In the hours after midnight, several record lows fell for the date, including 
at Kansas City, Mo., 55 degrees; Lincoln, Neb., 50; Marquette, Mich., 41; Des 
Moines, Iowa, 48; Chicago, 52; Topeka, Kan., 49; Milwaukee, 50, and South Bend, 
Ind., 46. 
</P>

Strong thunderstorms developed Sunday night in east-central New Mexico, Texas, 
northwestern Oklahoma and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
In Memphis, Tex., nearly two inches of rain fell in 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Early today, the thunderstorms and showers extended from New Mexico into 
Louisiana, with the strongest storms in Texas.

Four members of the Guardian Angels vigilante group descended on the Paris

increasingly dangerous underground system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to feel the atmosphere, to see if they need us," Guardian Angel 
co-founder Lisa Sliwa told a press conference at Chatelet, one of the city's 
roughest Metro stations. 
</P>
<P>
A thick belt of photographers and journalists surrounded the Angels, who wore 
the group's trademark red berets. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers were squeezed aside as the Angels passed through the turnstiles and 
took up position on the platform. 
</P>

Passengers, mostly tourists, looked on in confused amusement. One American 
tourist shouted out, "Yeah, you do a great job in New York, I tell ya, good

President Bush, his voice choked by emotion, paid tribute today to Marine Lt. 
Col. William R. Higgins, slain by his Lebanese captors, as "the symbol of the 
courage" of American servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Bush coupled his praise for Higgins and for others in uniform with an appeal 
for Congress to restore cuts it made in nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it is not a shortage of rifles that threatens to undermine America's 
ability to keep the peace," Bush said. "To preserve the peace today we must be 
strong in other ways. This means that we must rely on advanced technology, not 
the strategic equivalent of the horse cavalry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
War Department Anniversary 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke at a ceremony at Ft. Myer marking the 200th anniversary of the 
founding of the War Department, the forerunner of the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush flew to Fort A. P. Hill in Bowling Green, Va., where he urged about 
30,000 youths at the 12th National Boy Scout Jamboree to steer their friends 
away from crack cocaine and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He took with him three members of his Administration who were Eagle Scouts: 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner; Andrew Card, the deputy to Chief of 
Staff John H. Sununu, and Robert M. Gates, deputy national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
At Ft. Myer, just across the Potomac River from Washington, Bush said in a 
halting voice: 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot leave here today without pausing to salute one who stands as the 
symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of every American in uniform, 
one Marine who has been very much in our thoughts, Lt. Col. Higgins, William 
Richard Higgins." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retaliatory Hanging 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, head of a 75-member U.N. peacekeeping team, was kidnaped in south 
Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1987. His captors said last Monday that he had been hanged 
in retaliation for the Israeli kidnaping of a Muslim cleric. 
</P>
<P>
Putting in a plug for nuclear modernization, Bush said, "The United States 
today requires a closely integrated strategic program designed to enhance our 
strength, bolster deterrence and facilitate arms control." 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States must redeploy the 10-warhead MX missile from fixed 
silos and put them onto rail cars, and at the same time develop and deploy a 
smaller, single-warhead Midgetman missiles. 
</P>
<P>
He also pushed for more money for the radar-evading B-2 Stealth bomber and the 
Star Wars missile-defense system.

"He was a great leader," Jacques Fauvet, Beuve-Mery's successor as editor and

spirit and moral authority at the same time."

Striking Eastern Airlines pilots in New York and Atlanta voted to continue 
their walkout against the carrier, while pilots in Miami voiced support for the 
5-month-old strike. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots met separately Sunday in the first of a series of local meetings 
intended to assess the mood of the union membership. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Assn. at Eastern voted unanimously Saturday to 
continue the strike, but the leadership wants to gauge the depth of support for 
that action within the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald today quoted union sources as saying pilots in New York and 
Atlanta voted to remain on strike, but vote totals were not available. The 
meeting in Miami was recessed until Tuesday, when leaders expect to take a 
straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Only Option' 
</P>
<P>
"There are number of options before the (leadership council), and the options 
do include returning to work," said a spokesman for the pilots union, who asked 
not to be quoted by name. "That is not the only option (and) it is not the 
strongest option." 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union has supported the strike, which was called March 4 by the 
International Assn. of Machinists, the union that represents the airline's 
ground workers, and the union representing Eastern's flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 200 of Eastern's 3,500 pilots initially crossed the picket line, but 
Eastern claims that striking pilots have been returning to work in growing 
numbers. As of Aug. 1, Eastern said 367 pre-strike pilots were working. 
</P>
<P>
The union spokesman said the re-evaluation of the strike was not prompted by 
pilot defections. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not -- I could not -- characterize that as a reason for meeting," he

Rebuilding Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, which was forced by the strike to suspend much of its service and file 
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, 
has since begun to rebuild its flight schedule, in part with replacement 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
If the striking pilots were to return to work, a key issue would be how many 
jobs remain at Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
The airline says it has jobs for only about 1,700 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
As of Aug. 1, the company had trained 291 replacement pilots to fly for 
Eastern, and another 750 new hires were attending training classes.

Railroad workers have ratified an agreement with the Santa Fe Railway that 
authorizes a reduction in the size of some freight train crews, the carrier 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement covers 30% of Santa Fe's conductors, trainmen and yardmen," the 
railway said. "None of the approximately 1,300 employees involved will be 
furloughed as a result of this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
A standard crew consists of one conductor, one brakeman and one locomotive 
engineer. Under the agreement, on designated intermodal trains, which represent 
20% of the railway's through trains, there will be no brakeman. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the railway is providing $75,000 to each employee who voluntarily 
resigns. Those remaining employees will receive a $10,000 cash payment to be 
paid by the end of September and $65,000 to be indexed for inflation and 
distributed when they retire or leave the company.

INVESTORS WARNED ON DEALS THAT USE GOD AS COLLATERAL

Con artists, claiming God is their co-investor, bilked thousands of Americans 
out of more than $450 million in the last five years, according to a study 
released today by state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Beware of the growing number of investment con artists who are out to fleece 
the flocks of the faithful," John C. Baldwin, president of the North American 
Securities Administrators Assn., said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Religiously oriented swindles are one of today's hottest tickets for 
investment con artists," said Baldwin, who also is director of the Utah 
Division of Securities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Effort 
</P>
<P>
The national survey, a joint effort of the securities association and the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus, detailed investigations into investment 
schemes with religious overtones in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
The survey said the increase in "false prophets of investment has resulted in a 
surge of state-level complaints from consumers about fraud and abuse by 
self-proclaimed 'born again' financial planners, con artists claiming to be 
endorsed by local and national church officials, and givers of 'divinely 
inspired' investment advice about coins, precious metals, real estate and oil 
and gas well programs." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged scams outlined by the report included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A former preacher and Sunday school teacher, now serving four years in 
prison, who conned more than 600 investors in 20 states "who believed they were 
dealing with a man blessed by God with extraordinary business abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The former treasurer of a large Alabama church, also now in prison, who 
took an estimated $18 million from investors who were promised a return of up 
to 30% a month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Swindlers who bilked 10,000 investors in Utah out of $215 million by 
falsely claiming connections to the Mormon hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An oil and gas drilling company ordered by Massachusetts and Missouri 
authorities to stop selling stock to investors who were told the firm would use 
Old Testament prophecy to decide where to drill in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Some scam artists cite Biblical predictions of disaster or social chaos to woo 
investors in phony gold or rare coin schemes, the report said.

The Soviet Union is establishing two more Arctic research centers to forestall 
"ecological disaster" and monitor depletion of the ozone level in the vast 
frozen region surrounding the North Pole, Tass said today. 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet press agency said the government's third and fourth 
monitoring stations will be set up outside Murmansk, a city of 426,000 e near 
the Finnish border on the Barents Sea, and on the Norwegian island of 
Spitzbergen. 
</P>
<P>
"An ecological disaster may occur in the atmosphere of the Arctic," Tass said. 
"Some scientists believe that the density of the ozone layer, which protects 
the Earth from ultraviolet solar radiation, has been depleted there in recent 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The Arctic includes the 5,500-square-mile Arctic Ocean, the Bering Sea, 
Greenland, most of Iceland, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and the 
extreme northern sections of Alaska, Canada, Norway and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Arctic territories are the frigid region's most developed areas and 
form vast storehouses of mineral wealth, including huge deposits of nickel, 
copper, coal, gold, uranium, tungsten and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union was at the forefront of intensified efforts beginning in the 
1960s to search for mineral and power sources in the Arctic, one of the world's 
most sparsely populated regions. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Soviet) scientists' particular concern is aroused by the rapid increase 
in economic activity in the Arctic, which is the main cause of atmospheric 
pollution in high latitudes," Tass said.

tribunal to settle claims of American businesses and individuals against Iran. 
The award also covers interest, costs of arbitration and cancellation of a 
standby letter of credit.

The Blackhawks have signed veteran left winger Al Secord as a free agent, 
officials announced today. Secord, 31, will return to the Blackhawks after a 
nine-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
He originally was traded to Chicago on Dec. 18, 1980, from the Boston Bruins in 
exchange for defenseman Mike O'Connell. During the 1982-83 season, he scored 54 
goals, becoming one of only two Blackhawks to score 50 or more in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Secord was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with Ed Olczyk on Sept. 3, 
1987, for Steve Thomas, Bob McGill and Rick Vaive. He was traded to the 
Philadelphia Flyers at mid-season last year.

Former Denver Bronco starting cornerback Jeremiah Castille signed a series of 
one-year contracts, ending a three-month holdout during which he refused to 
speak to Coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not released, but it was reported that Castille will 
get the same pay as last year, $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
Castille's holdout began when the Broncos left him unprotected under terms of 
the NFL's Plan B free-agency system. He demanded to be traded, boycotted an 
off-season mini-camp and refused to report to camp two weeks ago.

TORONTO EDGES RANGERS 2-1, REACHES .500 FOR 8TH TIME

Toronto reached the .500 mark for the eighth time this season as John Cerutti 
pitched a five-hitter today for a 2-1 victory over the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Texas shortstop Fred Manrique's two sixth-inning errors led to both runs as the 
Blue Jays improved to 56-56 overall and 44-32 since Cito Gaston replaced Jimy 
Williams as manager. On each of the seven previous occasions that the Blue Jays 
got to .500, they lost the next game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Complete Game 
</P>
<P>
Toronto began the day three games behind division-leading Baltimore in the AL 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Cerutti, 9-5, pitched his second straight complete game, striking out five 
without walking a batter. The Rangers' only run came on Steve Buechele's 12th 
homer of the season, a drive just over the left-field fence with one out in the 
fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Manrique's errors enabled the Blue Jays to score twice in the sixth off 
Mike Jeffcoat, who fell to 5-5 despite pitching allowing only four hits in 7 
1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Lee led off with an infield single and took second on Manrique's throwing 
error. Tony Fernandez followed with a high chopper to Manrique, who threw the 
ball past first again, allowing Lee to score and Fernandez to go to second. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez took third on Mookie Wilson's grounder and scored on Kelly Gruber's 
sacrifice fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffcoat struck out four and walked two before being relieved by Cecilio Guante 
with one out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, who have lost three straight games, have made 12 errors in their 
last five games.

ORIOLES APPEAR TO BE LOSING BEN MCDONALD TO AN INVISIBLE LEAGUE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orioles appear to be losing the race for Ben McDonald to an invisible 
opponent -- a baseball league without franchises that has yet to play one game. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, the first player selected in June's free agent draft, has declined 
the Orioles' most recent offer and will decide in the next 10 days whether he 
will join the proposed league, in which play is supposed to begin in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben has evaluated offers from the Baltimore Orioles and from the external 
market," McDonald's agent, Scott Boras, said in a telephone interview from his 
office in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Boras declined to elaborate on what he meant by an open market. But he 
apparently was referring to the proposed league that was conceived by David 
Lefevre, a New York attorney and former minority owner of the Houston Astros 
and Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
According to newspapers in Baltimore and Washington, representatives of the new 
league have offered McDonald a two-year contract worth $2 million. Boras and 
McDonald met with backers of the new league last week in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have offered McDonald a package worth more than $600,000. The offer 
includes a signing bonus of $300,000, a guaranteed contract for 1990 and an 
option year for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baltimore Orioles tendered an offer last Friday, and Ben McDonald has 
declined," Boras said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reiterates Offer 
</P>
<P>
"We made our offer," Orioles President Larry Lucchino said. "We have reiterated 
our offer. It's there for Ben McDonald. It's an extraordinary offer for Ben 
McDonald." 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the second-biggest ever offered an amateur player, exceeded only by 
the three-year, $1.06-million contract given to Bo Jackson in 1986 by the 
Kansas City Royals. The Royals outbid the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who made 
Jackson the first pick in the 1986 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McDonald, who represented his son in early negotiations with the Orioles, 
said after the baseball draft that he was seeking a deal similar to Jackson's. 
</P>
<P>
Boras said McDonald would sign with the Orioles if they match the offer from 
the new league. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben has not changed his demands from the beginning," Boras said. "Even though 
an external market has put a value on him, he has not changed his original 
demand to the Baltimore Orioles." 
</P>
<P>
Larry McDonald said baseball is lagging behind other sports in its signing 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, baseball is going to have to change its system," McDonald 
told USA Today. "Troy Aikman gets $11 million for five years, and he hasn't 
thrown a pass in pro football. Patrick Ewing got $6 (million) or $7 million for 
three years, and he had never shot a basket in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looking for Security' 
</P>
<P>
"The Orioles offered Ben a $255,000 signing bonus and $850 a month in the 
minors to see what he can do. That's baseball tradition for the owners to put 
the money in their pockets. The new generation of players is looking for 
security." 
</P>
<P>
If the Orioles sweeten their offer, McDonald will listen, Boras said. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations have been amicable and the lines of communication are still 
open," Boras said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was 14-4 with a 3.49 ERA and 202 strikeouts as a junior at Louisiana 
State this year. The Major League Scouting Bureau gave him its highest rating 
ever for a pitcher.
