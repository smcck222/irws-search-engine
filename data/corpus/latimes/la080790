PROPOSALS ON BALANCING FEDERAL DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposal to reduce the mortgage interest deduction to $20,000 maximum must 
be killed! 
</P>
<P>
This is another tax on the middle class that unfairly affects all of us in the 
Los Angeles and California areas where prices of real estate are double the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
The $20,000 deduction would limit the house value to $220,000, using 10% down 
and 10% interest. Prices for homes in the Los Angeles area are much higher than 
$220,000 so interest is greater than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of passing this limit would be to raise taxes greatly and to reduce 
the prices of homes dramatically as people will not be able to afford the 
higher payments without the tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
As a recent retiree (caused by the defense layoffs), my plan to sell my house 
and live off the proceeds will be crushed. Add this to the proposal to limit 
state and local tax deductions to $10,000 and the current tax on Social 
Security the result will be that a retiree's plans for financial independence 
will be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that when it is your turn, they change the rules? 
</P>
<P>
I propose eliminating the interest deduction from second (vacation) homes, 
reducing foreign giveaways and taxing the rich at the same level as the middle 
class -- 33%.

THURGOOD MARSHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall's remarks regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Judge 
David Souter and President Bush only served to demean the Supreme Court and 
raise serious questions about Marshall's continued presence on the court 
("Somebody's Calling Bush's Shots, Marshall Says," Part A, July 27). 
</P>
<P>
It is apparent that Justice Marshall is unable to remain and unbiased jurist 
and sit in judgment on the important cases that come before the court. It might 
be wise for the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings to determine 
whether Justice Marshall should be subject to impeachment for his conduct, 
after completing its confirmation hearings on Judge Souter.

CAMPAIGN WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
A GOOD ISSUE, BUT THE WRONG MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson both are instinctual political 
moderates, few genuine differences over issues have emerged in their 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
However, as she demonstrated in the Democratic primary, Feinstein has a shrewd 
sense of the electorate's anxieties and an ability to make her opponent their 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
In that race, she managed to link women's apprehension about reproductive 
rights to John Van de Kamp's personal reservations about abortion. Now, she has 
sensed the voters' anger over the savings and loan debacle. As a result, her 
campaign is attempting to imply that Wilson is particularly culpable in the 
matter because he received unusually large contributions from S&amp;L 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Neither point is supported by facts. A recent Common Cause report said that 
Wilson had received more money, $243,000, from thrift-related contributors than 
any other senator. It did not point out that during the period analyzed, Wilson 
ran for office twice, while many of his colleagues had run only once. Moreover, 
his funds were reported as direct contributions, while S&amp;L gifts to his 
colleagues often were disguised. For example, Alan Cranston, who ran only once 
during the period, is listed by Common Cause has having received only $143,700. 
No mention is made of the $1 million he got for a voter registration drive. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is no evidence that Wilson, whose S&amp;L contributions account 
for less than 1% of his total campaign funding, ever intervened on behalf of 
the thrifts.

STATISTICS ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those are pretty wild statistics quoted by Los Angeles Councilman Marvin 
Braude: "425,000 die from tobacco each year. . . . Smoking costs this country 
$65 billion a year" (Commentary, July 21). How can anyone obtain these precise 
figures? Has each smoker got a nicotine meter attached to his body? How about 
people who die from caffeine in coffee and tea? Why isn't this drug taxed? 
Because all politicians drink it? Smokers contribute $10 billion a year in 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Who would make up this loss and how many would be unemployed if tobacco were 
banned? How about the smokers who've lived to a ripe old age? 
</P>
<P>
Does do-gooder Braude know about the study showing that kids, by the age of 10, 
have damaged lungs from smog, not tobacco. All of us have to breathe this foul 
toxic air that is killing all of us, yet Braude and other politicians condemn 
smokers as more dangerous! Have smokers no rights? Where is the ACLU in this 
matter? When will these picayune politicians concern themselves with the real 
problems destroying our society, like pornography and obscenity, and stop 
harassing taxpaying smokers? 
</P>
<P>
I am going on 80, and have been smoking for 60 years. If the Braude bunch 
intends to prohibit tobacco, somebody better tell them what Prohibition did to 
this country.

The intemperate interview given by Justice Marshall on ABC television regarding 
the Souter nomination is the best argument I've seen for mandatory retirement 
for Supreme Court justices.

More cities are just saying "no smoking." I am a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
But how can you ban something that is not illegal. The anti-smokers have rights 
I agree, but I have a right, too. It is called freedom of choice. I am very 
considerate about smoking. If someone in the room doesn't smoke, I ask if it is 
OK. But if they are rude, like most of the anti-smokers, so am I. Plus, I don't 
see how secondhand smoke is so bad because there are a lot of other things such 
as smog that are worse.

While the congressional Budget Reduction Committee is planning to raise taxes

working on approval of a $55-billion subsidy over five years for the very

So you want to ban smoking in all eating establishment? Well you go right ahead 
and do that little thing. And when the 40% of smokers stop eating out, the 
restaurants can do one of two things. 
</P>
<P>
If business falls off 40%, they can: close or raise the price of a $20 dinner 
40% to $28. Remember, the loss has to be made up somewhere, and I would be 
delighted to see these zealots pay an additional 40% for their dining in a 
"smoke-free environment." I'll stay home and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
And when you leave that "smoke-free" environment, don't breath on the way home. 
L.A.'s filthy air is gonna kill you a lot quicker than my secondhand smoke. But 
that doesn't seem to be an issue with you people.

BLUE JAYS THROWN FOR 4-3 LOSS, PUSHED TWO GAMES BACK

Charlie Hough outpitched Dave Stieb and the Texas Rangers threw out two runners 
on the bases in the ninth inning to hold off the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-3, Monday 
night at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto went 3-5 on its trip and fell two games behind Boston in the American 
League East, while Texas won for the seventh time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (14-4) had not given up a run in two victories over the Rangers this 
season, but was tagged for four runs on seven hits in six innings. He had been 
7-0 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hough (9-7) gave up two runs on six hits in seven innings. He struck out seven 
and walked two. Kenny Rogers got his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Chicago 4 -- Gerald Perry's double and two errors by catcher 
Carlton Fisk keyed a five-run third inning that lifted the Royals over the 
White Sox at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, which snapped the White Sox's five-game winning streak, dropped 
Chicago three games behind idle Oakland in the American League West. Melido 
Perez (10-9) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Davis (5-7) gave up five hits in five innings and Jeff Montgomery got his 
16th save. 
</P>
<P>
Perry made it 4-0 with his two-run double to right, giving him six RBIs in his 
last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 6, Minnesota 0 -- Ron Robinson broke Milwaukee's eight-game losing 
streak by pitching his first major league shutout, leading the Brewers past the 
Twins at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson (5-3) pitched a six-hitter, struck out two and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker and B.J. Surhoff each had three of Milwaukee's 14 hits and Paul 
Molitor had two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Smith (5-10) fell to 1-4 since returning to the rotation June 26. 
</P>
<P>
New York 2, Cleveland 1 -- Rookie Kevin Maas broke a sixth-inning tie with his 
11th home run to lead the Yankees to a victory over the Indians at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mass homered off Greg Swindell (7-7), who struck out eight and gave up eight 
hits, including another homer by Roberto Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Andy Hawkins (3-9) gave up seven hits in eight innings, walked two 
and struck out three. Hawkins, who failed to win a game between May 6 and July 
27, has won two of his last three decisions.

GAVALDON WINS, SEEKS CHANCE TO PLAY NAVRATILOVA

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angelica Gavaldon came dressed for success. The color-conscious 16-year old 
from Coronado left the neons at home and opted instead for all-white. 
</P>
<P>
But the player who has quickly developed a reputation as being one of the more 
flamboyant dressers on the tour didn't break with tradition entirely -- a red 
band held her long hair in place. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening match of the Great American Bank Tennis Tournament Monday night, 
Gavaldon played like a seasoned veteran, defeating West Germany's Claudia 
Porwik, 7-5, 6-4 before 3,514 at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. The 
victory earned Gavaldon, who turned professional in February, the chance to 
play the second-ranked player in the world, should Martina Navratilova win her 
opening match against Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer tonight at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I was down in both sets," Gavaldon said, "I was very happy to be 
able to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday's draw, Gavaldon has known Navratilova would be her opponent in 
the second round, should she beat Porwik as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon made it to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in January, then 
was stopped by Porwik. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my best victory," she said of winning Monday night, "but I was happy 
to get another chance to play her. I could have gotten to the semis at the 
Australian Open if I had beat her there." 
</P>
<P>
With her powerful groundstrokes, Gavaldon had Porwik moving from side to side 
in the backcourt. But with her first match point, Gavaldon double-faulted for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Was it nerves or a bad toss? Neither. It was Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
"On match point that's what I was thinking about," she said. "But I'm not 
nervous about playing her. I have nothing to lose. I'm just glad I have an 
opportunity to play her." 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon may still be a new kid on the block, but she is still more well known 
than rookie Alysia May, the other wild-card player. They can make the veterans 
nervous. Ask Manuela Maleeva. 
</P>
<P>
May, a former UCLA All-American, turned pro two months ago in Singapore, and 
gave fourth-seeded Maleeva a scare before losing Monday night, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
"I think she played very well," said Maleeva, "not knowing who she is and where 
she's from. I don't know if she can play every day like this." 
</P>
<P>
If, indeed, she can, May's emergence on the pro tour verifies Maleeva's view 
that in today's tournaments, there is no such thing as an easy match. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's so good now," she said. "I really think, against the player you 
haven't heard of, you can't afford one mistake, you can't relax for one point." 
</P>
<P>
May was down, 4-1, in the second set before winning her serve to take a 5-4 
lead. But both players held serve -- Maleeva held twice -- to force the 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was becoming impatient," May said. "But then I settled down and started to 
play better." 
</P>
<P>
In the opening match on center court, Terry Phelps of Larchmont, N.Y. dropped 
the first set, but came back to upset seventh-seeded Gretchen Magers of San 
Diego, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Renata Baranski, the 150th-ranked player in the world, eliminated Catarina 
Lindqvist, a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1989, 0-6, 6-4, 6-2. Martina Navratilova 
will play Rancho Bernardo's Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer tonight at 6:30. 
Top-seeded Steffi Graf, the No. 1 player in the world, will play wild-card 
entrant Stephanie Rehe of Oceanside today at 11 a.m.

Old Chicago: Al Capone has finally won his case. Unfortunately for the 
Prohibition-era gangster, his victory came only in a mock trial during an 
American Bar Assn. meeting in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Capone lost the trial that counted in 1931. Sunday's not guilty verdict came on 
two counts of failure to file tax returns and three counts of attempted income 
tax evasion.

New Chicago: Former Mayor Jane Byrne may return from political retirement to 
challenge Mayor Richard Daley in his 1991 reelection bid, the Chicago Sun-Times 
reported Sunday. "I've been getting encouragement from throughout the city," 
Byrne told the paper. Daley's reaction? "Is she really running?"

Big Money: Dethroned heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is the highest-paid 
athlete in the world with an estimated $28.6 million in income this year, 
according to Forbes magazine. Buster Douglas, little known until he upset Tyson

another boxer, Sugar Ray Leonard, at $13 million. Next are auto racers Ayrton 
Senna at $10 million and Alain Prost at $9 million.

Little Mark: Roll Call, Capitol Hill's insider newspaper, wants to do an

reviving memories of the tiger reportedly tattooed on the tail of former 
Secretary of State George Shultz. Anyone with skin art was encouraged to call 
in, and anyone who has seen some during those nude swims at the gym can turn in 
a colleague, "confidentiality assured," the paper said.

<P>
Judi Sullivan of Glendale has sent me a strange letter, or document, that she 
says she found in the bushes outside her house. It was wet and torn, and had 
evidently been blown there in a storm. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is not dated, but since there has been no storm in Glendale for some 
time, I assume it is a few months old. It appears to be a fragment, and, oddly, 
is in legal form, listing a plaintiff and a defendant, the author herself. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sullivan says the letter struck her as funny. "I can feel the writer's 
frustration, though sense there is no pain as one so often finds in male-female 
conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
I sense real pain; at least the woman has had it, finally, with her male 
adversary. Their relationship is through; kaput. The spelling is atrocious, but 
that may be because the author evidently is learning to use a computer. I have 
corrected the spelling except in one instance, which I have marked sic. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sullivan has humanely crossed out the two names, though I wouldn't have 
used them anyway. The letter begins: 
</P>
<P>
"We now come to the point where we can really talk here, but I don't wish to 
make it hard. . . . I just want to express my feeling that I won't take this 
kind of carp (sic) any more. 
</P>
<P>
"I really hate you, and think you are very sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick! 
. . . Why do you keep doing the things you do? I really can't understand but 
I'll bet you have a real good reason. . . . I don't like it one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I will have to do something to you to make you stop pestering me with 
the clicking in my house. I am just fooling around with my new computer, trying 
to get to the bottom of this legal paper so that I can see the line number and 
set it up for my customer tomorrow when he comes because I am going to do a 
document for him. . . . I really like my own business and everybody seems to 
love my work. I am so very excited that I can't stand it. I just know that I 
will do extremely well and make some money to support myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you will do. I think you will be a real loser in the long run 
because you have gotten away with so much for so many years. I don't love you 
at all and can't think that you could be so crazy as to buy a house 200 yards 
from me." 
</P>
<P>
End document. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many questions," remarks Mrs. Sullivan. "Is this her husband? What 
is the clicking? Why can't she spell? And, of course, did they end up 
together?" 
</P>
<P>
I sense that this letter, or document, was never sent, and was never meant to 
be sent. It is simply an expression of anger and frustration in the war between 
the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
I have already suggested why its author apparently can't spell. Her anger might 
have something to do with that, as well as her inexperience on her computer. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously she is setting out on a new life, and she is frightened. The clicking 
she hears may be the symptoms of a mild paranoia -- or else it is her husband, 
or partner, clicking his teeth. He may be in the next room, for all we know. 
</P>
<P>
My guess is that this woman has made up her mind to be independent of a cad, 
and she is trying to keep him away with a document that obviously has no legal 
force, and will most likely never be read by him. 
</P>
<P>
Why he has bought a house only 200 yards from her I can't guess, but it 
suggests to me that he is as crazy as she thinks he is. Did she receive their 
house in a divorce settlement? Does he want to be near her to continue 
antagonizing her? Does he really love her? 
</P>
<P>
Reading only her side of it, my sentiments are with the woman in this case. She 
obviously needs space, as they say. Her husband or partner, whatever his 
virtues, is obviously a nerd and a pest. She is well rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt the author of this rather pitiful document will ever see this column, 
but if she does, I want her to know that at least one person is on her side. 
</P>
<P>
I do have some advice for her, though. She had better learn to spell, if she 
hopes to be independent, especially in the computer typing of documents. 
</P>
<P>
Carp was by no means the worst of her errors, though perhaps it was the most 
felicitous. 
</P>
<P>
How this document ended up in the brush outside Mrs. Sullivan's house I don't 
know. But I suspect that its author got her angst out of her system by writing 
it; then heard that mysterious clicking, rushed to her front door and threw it 
out into the storm. 
</P>
<P>
One thing she better do is keep that brute at least 200 yards away.

ART BUCHWALD: AN UNWIFELY QUIET ON SRO RESTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife is a strong women's rights advocate. She will fight for any kind of 
equal opportunity, except when it comes to larger public restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The other evening we went to see a hit Broadway show. After the first act, she 
excused herself to wash her hands. 
</P>
<P>
When she failed to return to her seat 20 minutes later, I decided to look for 
her. She was in line on 52nd Street slowly wending her way toward the washroom. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think?" I asked her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to make the second act." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because I never make the second act when I go to the washroom. I don't even 
know how 'Phantom of the Opera' ends." 
</P>
<P>
"You're a pessimist," I told her. "As I see it, there are only another 100 
yards to the restroom door. All you need is a few breaks, and you'll be home 
free." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do they build a theater for 2,000 people and a women's restroom for two?" 
she wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's because theater owners have to put their money where it will help 
the show -- in the scenery. As far as they are concerned washrooms are a waste 
of space. They would rather have the square footage for standing room only." 
</P>
<P>
My wife said, "If I don't make it, brief me about the second act on the way 
home." 
</P>
<P>
"You'll make it. Remember when you were waiting at 'Chorus Line'? Despite your 
doubts, you got back for the final curtain." 
</P>
<P>
"That's because I went to the restroom at the beginning of the first act. I 
missed the opening and all the scenes that followed." 
</P>
<P>
"Look, you just moved up three places. This could be your night." 
</P>
<P>
She said, "Why don't you find someone to sit with in the second act -- then my 
seat won't be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
"Nosirree. I came with you and I won't let anyone take your place. I can't 
understand why women don't raise more hell about the restroom facilities of our 
theaters and sports palaces. 
</P>
<P>
"They will protest every indignity heaped on their sex except what architects 
are doing to cut down on their washroom rights. If you don't raise your voices, 
you're going to be standing in line for the rest of your lives." 
</P>
<P>
"It's undignified to make a fuss over those rights," she explained. "We do have 
pride." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe so -- but that doesn't mean you're going to see the big finish of this 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you suggest women do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Take over the men's john for starters and lock them out. If males can't get 
back for the second act, they will be the ones to let management know it." 
</P>
<P>
My wife was in tears. "The last time I saw an entire show was when I was 6 
years old." 
</P>
<P>
"I hear music. I think I'd better go back to my seat." 
</P>
<P>
"Au revoir," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I told her, "It isn't your fault that the theater owners won't build decent 
facilities for their customers." 
</P>
<P>
The lady behind my wife asked me, "Are you in line?" 
</P>
<P>
I told her I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Good," she said. "That means I can still catch the midnight local to 
Stamford."

TENNIS ACES RALLY BIDDERS AT WOMEN'S SPORTS BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene 
</P>
<P>
About 320 local tennis fans gathered at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach 
on Friday for cocktails and auction bidding to support the UC Irvine Athletic 
Foundation and the Women's Sports Foundation. The $75-per-ticket, two-hour 
party raised $30,000 and concluded with a shuttle ride to the John Wayne Tennis 
Club, where the Dukes, a professional team from Orange County, played the L.A. 
Strings. 
</P>
<P>
Focal Points 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes and Strings are two of nine teams in a national league called 
Teamtennis, which was founded 10 years ago by guest of honor Billie Jean King. 
Looking businesslike in a turquoise blazer and black slacks, King arrived to 
the flash of photographers' strobes, the craning of rubbernecks and the 
outstretched pens of autograph seekers. She obliged, looking a little pained by 
all the fuss. A few minutes later, a smiling, joking, stunningly svelte Martina 
Navratilova showed up, doubling the banquet hall buzz. The two tennis legends 
settled at a table near the door, where they ate and chatted with friends 
between interruptions. Among those seated with the queens of the court were 
former top-ranked player Rosie Casals and Deborah Anderson, executive director 
of the Women's Sports Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Speeches 
</P>
<P>
After guests had a chance to browse silent-auction tables and serve themselves 
pastas and other goodies from the buffet, Anderson stepped to the podium. The 
New York-based, nonprofit foundation she heads -- another of King's creations 
-- was founded 17 years ago as "a collective voice for women in sports," she 
said. Now 330,000 members strong, that voice is heard through educational 
programs, grants to athletes and coaches, and government lobbying. Anderson 
described a recent survey of high school students that ranked athletes equal or 
better than nonathletes in achievement tests and grades and indicated that 
athletes were more involved with community organizations and less likely to 
take drugs. "So the 'dumb jock' myth is just that -- a myth," she said. Next up 
was King, who garnered a standing ovation. "Very good," she said, when the 
applause died down. "That was the seventh-inning stretch." Saying she hadn't 
known that she would be called on to speak, King kept it short and sweet -- a 
few words about growing up in Long Beach, and a few more about the ongoing 
fight for equal opportunities for women. She asked parents to "encourage your 
girls to be active, not passive. We get a lot of messages to be so-o-o 
dependent and so-o-o stupid," she said, singsonging for a big laugh. "Then we 
get out in life and we're in trouble!" 
</P>
<P>
Working The Room 
</P>
<P>
Before regrouping court side, guests had a shot at a few items up for grabs in 
a live auction. Navratilova opened bidding on Rams quarterback Jim Everett's 
jersey (taken home by Leslie Cancellieri of Huntington Beach, who paid $550 for 
the tent-size orange shirt), then sat back and listened while bids piled up for 
one of her own racquets. Actually, she only sat back until the bidding stalled 
at $700, when she took the microphone from the auctioneer. "This racquet has a 
built-in forehand," Navratilova joked. King took over. "This is historic! She 
used this racquet at Wimbledon! (Last month, Navratilova became the only person 
ever to win nine singles titles at Wimbledon.) C'mon people! Let's go!" (They 
went. The racquet -- plus a rubber chicken, a Spuds McKenzie doll and 10 
lottery tickets -- sold for $1,500.) 
</P>
<P>
Faces 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Fred Lieberman, owner of the Dukes; Greg Patton, the Dukes' 
coach and men's coach at UC Irvine; Tom Ford, UCI's athletic director; Lynn 
Cox, the globe-trotting swimmer from Los Alamitos, and Dukes players Sophie 
Amiach, Marty Davis, Amy Frazier and Roger Smith.

Rappers Get Rapped: Rap duo Kid 'n Play may have to return to Augusta, Ga., to 
face charges for "simulating sex" on stage during a concert there Thursday, a 
spokeswoman for the New York act's record company said Monday. Christopher 
(Kid) Reid and Christopher (Play) Martin, stars of the movie "House Party," 
were arrested after appearing as an opening act for Public Enemy at the 
Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center, and were freed after paying fines of $550 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Bennick, vice president of creative services for Select Records, described 
the actions that led to the arrests as "making love to the stage," and said it 
is a regular feature of the duo's show. Neither Augusta police nor Kid 'n Play 
was available for comment Monday. GREG BRAXTON

"Inside the White House" will use newly available material from the 
presidential libraries to give viewers an "incisive, behind-the-scenes look at 
presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt through Ronald Reagan," producers said. 
In addition, dramatizations with actual historical dialogue will be combined 
with existing footage. The producers are shopping the show around to several 
networks. GREG BRAXTON

Peter Hall Quits Glyndebourne: An artistic tiff over Peter Sellars' staging of 
Mozart's "Magic Flute" at the Glyndebourne Festival has resulted in Sir Peter 
Hall resigning last weekend as artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 59, said he had not been consulted about Sellars' radical production -- 
which has no dialogue and is staged on a Los Angeles freeway. In his 
resignation letter, Hall said his quarrel was not with Sellars, but with 
Glyndebourne "which now attaches little importance to my artistic opinion." 
Hall had been artistic director of the festival, one of the world's most 
prestigious opera organizations, since 1984 and associated with it for 20 
years. GREG BRAXTON

Opera Turnarounds: Soprano Karen Beardsley will sing Marzelline in the Music 
Center Opera production of "Fidelio," which opens the season with a 
five-performance run Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
She replaces Elise Ross, who decided that the part -- new to her -- was too 
high for her voice, according to a company spokesman. Beardsley made her debut 
with Music Center Opera in June, singing the role of Max in "Where the Wild 
Things Are." In other changes to the announced season, David Pountney will make 
his local debut directing "Elektra," which opens Feb. 23. Additionally, George 
de la Pena and Heather Toma have been cast as the lead dancers in Mark Morris' 
ballet segment of "Nixon in China," opening Sept. 11. GREG BRAXTON

LOWENTHAL PLAYS NEWLY DISCOVERED LISZT CONCERTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that Franz Liszt wrote three piano concertos, circa 1839. The two we 
know he later revised, performed and published, while their sibling was left 
forgotten in subsequently dispersed manuscripts -- until musicologist Jay 
Rosenblatt discovered and assembled them last winter. The new/old work, now the 
Piano Concerto No. 3 in E-flat, was premiered in Chicago in May. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, pianist Jerome Lowenthal and the enterprising forces of the Music 
Academy of the West gave the first West Coast performance of the piece, on a 
characteristically rich and varied program, in the sold-out Lobero Theatre of 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the excitement of discovery and the imperatives of research, the 
exhumation raises many questions. On an intellectual level are the 
ethical-aesthetic issues of creative rights, while more practically one might 
wonder about the need for another Liszt piano concerto when the two we have are 
hardly overworked. 
</P>
<P>
This one, however -- ignoring Liszt's feelings about it -- could be the pick of 
the litter. Like the others it is in one compact, substantial movement, though 
it is the most novel in form. It also moves far beyond Romantic rhetoric into 
the rarefied realm of articulate instrumental drama. 
</P>
<P>
It received eloquent championship from Lowenthal in a vivid, compelling 
performance. There are plenty of fireworks in the piece, which he ignited with 
big attacks, but Lowenthal also allowed a quieter voice to be heard, one 
pleading and rhapsodic. He insinuated as well asserted, giving the outbursts 
greater vehemence in contrast, and let the structure evolve organically. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenthal also enriched the long program with a clean, clear, wonderfully lithe 
and expressive account of Mozart's Rondo in D, K. 382. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Leighton Smith and the Festival Orchestra were active partners in both 
concerted works, supporting sensitively and rising in powerful argument when 
needed. The sound of the young orchestra, filling the cramped Lobero stage to 
bursting, could be raw at times, but never flaccid or unmotivated. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and his charges invested Mozart's "Prague" Symphony, K. 504, with 
abundant energy, in a reading pointed firmly forward at all times. At the end 
of the afternoon they turned in a colorfully swooning, ardently dancing 
performance of the Second Suite from Ravel's "Daphnis et Chloe." 
</P>
<P>
From the Academy ranks came 24-year-old conductor David Wiley to lead Elliott 
Carter's difficult Variations for Orchestra. He launched it with great 
authority in the darkling, often thunderous mysteries of the Introduction and 
Theme, and kept the diffuse, abstruse chamber music of the nine variations 
gamely together, if not thoroughly convincing or polished. JOHN HENKEN

CLIMATIC COMPETITION AT SUNDAY BOWL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes a lot to upstage Mother Nature. That John Nelson, Cho-Liang Lin and 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute Orchestra even came close in their 
Sunday night concert at Hollywood Bowl is tribute to their considerable 
music-making abilities. 
</P>
<P>
This was no routine evening at the Bowl. Lightning, thunder, rain -- and plenty 
of it -- livened/dampened the evening. But few of the 6,892 in attendance felt 
the need to leave, opting instead to stay for what proved uncommonly compelling 
performances of Prokofiev and Schumann, under any conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Lin's performance of the Violin Concerto No. 1 by Prokofiev was remarkable for 
its unremitting intensity. The violinist seems virtually incapable of producing 
harsh sounds, even though he dug into his part with fiery aggression. His tone 
never wavered, never thinned, his intonation remained perfect, and nothing 
overtaxed his technical capabilities. As a result, this virtuoso performance 
managed not to call attention to itself; the focus remained firmly on the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
When the rain began in the third movement his playing only gained in intensity, 
despite the not inconsiderable ruckus in the audience and clatter onstage as 
violinists scooted to avoid the wet. Otherwise, Nelson kept the orchestra in 
tight order, offering keen, flexible support. 
</P>

Spectacular thunder and lightning together with sporadic rain accompanied,

declamations and crisp timpani interjections.

Joe Orton's "Loot," a deliciously mordant farce revolving around an embalmed 
corpse and a bank robbery, died on arrival over the weekend at the Newport 
Theatre Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
This production needs an autopsy, not a review. Please consider the following a 
coroner's report: 
</P>
<P>
* The deceased was well-dressed and appeared to be in reasonable health at 
first glance, a misapprehension quickly revealed at the onset of the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite actors who put on passable imitations of British accents, the lines 
were almost invariably starved of their caustic wit through a fatal lack of 
timing. Only the most obvious wisecracks survived. 
</P>
<P>
* On opening night Friday, asphyxiation occurred by the end of the first act. A 
shorter, faster-paced second act -- during which Orton explodes his lethal 
package -- provided a few bracing twitches of momentary life before it, too, 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
* The ultimate cause of death was an all-too-common form of theatrical 
strangulation, resulting from a combination of static direction, misread 
characterizations and awkward casting. 
</P>
<P>
Was there anything right with this production? 
</P>
<P>
Not much. The players remembered their lines and were more than willing. The 
set was serviceable, the costumes better than that, the lighting sufficient. 
But a production made less resonant on the stage than the play is on the page 
is not worth the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Orton's biting indictment of a totally corrupt and hypocritical society depends 
on absurdities taken to extremes. The diabolical inner logic must be 
underscored by stiletto-sharp execution or it culminates in little more than 
the mannered trappings of a drawing-room comedy, albeit one with a maniacal 
cast of characters. 
</P>
<P>
"Loot" is not an easy farce to stage correctly even in England, where the 
satire ought to be clearest. The 1965 world premiere in Cambridge flopped. 
Trying to explain that, Orton biographer John Lahr has pointed to the premiere 
production's cartoonish sets and campy acting. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright himself believed "Loot" should be played absolutely straight, so 
as to emphasize the contradictions among what the characters say, what they do 
and who they are. " 'Loot' is a serious play," he wrote. "Unless (it) is 
directed and acted seriously, the play will fail. As it failed in its original 
touring version. A director who imagines that the only object is to get a laugh 
is not for me." 
</P>
<P>
Given the roles in "Loot" -- subversive caricatures really -- and the utterly 
unrealistic plot, Orton's prescription for comic success would test the limits 
of a professional company, to say nothing of a troupe of amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the late Mrs. McLeavy -- played by a dummy that gets dumped out of its 
coffin to make room for money stolen in a bank robbery -- there is McLeavy 
(David MacArthur), a Catholic widower in late middle age whose devotion to the 
church is perhaps exceeded only by his devotion to his rose garden. 
</P>
<P>
Fay (Kathryn Byrd) is the imperious young nurse recently hired to care for 
McLeavy's dear departed wife. With her patient departed and her job at an end, 
Fay doesn't take long to let McLeavy know where she stands. ("You've been a 
widower for three days. Have you considered a second marriage?") When it comes 
to widowhood, Fay knows whereof she speaks. A serial killer, she has seven dead 
husbands to her credit. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's McLeavy's gay son, Hal (Reed Boyer), an unemployed layabout whose 
chief fault is his inconvenient habit of blurting out the truth. Hal's 
homosexuality is scarcely hinted at here, let alone explored, except for a 
brief (and stereotypical) bit of narcissistic primping. Why the omission, which 
is crucial to the trademark Orton tone of the play? 
</P>
<P>
The rake in this peculiar menage is Hal's bisexual lover, Dennis (Tom Orr). 
Having already bedded Fay, he has proposed marriage to her and is devastated by 
her refusal -- if only because it casts doubt on his sexual prowess. Dennis 
also happens to be the local undertaker and the mastermind of the bank robbery 
that he and Hal have committed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is Truscott of Scotland Yard, a very bribable veteran detective 
with a streak of violence. He resembles an evil-minded Sherlock Holmes in his 
determination to solve the robbery. Lacking a search warrant, Truscott gains 
entry to the McLeavy house by posing rather ludicrously as an inspector from 
the Metropolitan Water Board. He commonly flouts the law, in fact, and whether 
he catches the real bank robbers or frames an innocent party makes no 
difference to him. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the players, MacArthur comes closest to portraying his role without 
damage to the playwright's intentions. His McLeavy is a bumbling mourner, 
fastidious in keeping up appearances and conventional to the point of idiocy. 
The monotonous tone that eventually overtakes MacArthur's performance, although 
tedious and annoying, actually enhances it. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's depiction of Fay betrays more unfulfilled promise than the other 
characterizations, because the actress seems capable of growth in the role. She 
is well-spoken in her effort to be the commanding, rapacious nurse, but she 
puts too much emphasis on the prim sound of her lines and too little on their 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Orr brings a lot of energy to his performance. As game as he is, though, and 
despite a certain comic flair for suggesting a small-time hoodlum, the role of 
Dennis somehow eludes him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boyer doesn't show much as Hal. And Kevin Knill, who looks entirely 
too young for Truscott, is simply miscast. He also needs to slow down and stop 
swallowing his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loot" continues through Sept. 2 at the Newport Theatre Arts Center, 2501 
Cliff Drive, Newport Beach. Performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 
p.m., Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $10. Information: (714) 631-0288.

NEW RULES PLACED ON TAILGATE PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In yet another attempt to cut back on drinking-related rowdiness at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium, the City Council on Monday authorized the creation of a 
caterer's permit that must be acquired by fans who intend to serve beer from 
kegs at their pre- and post-game tailgate parties. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which will take effect shortly before San Diego State 
University's football season begins in the fall, would force tailgaters to seek 
a $25 caterer's permit and provide $1 million in liability insurance, according 
to Steve Shushan, the stadium's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ordinance does not specifically require tailgaters to hire a 
caterer before tapping a keg in the stadium parking lot, "there aren't too many 
people out there who will be able to afford that kind of insurance," Shushan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium authorities believe that the permit system will cut back on alcohol 
consumption by forcing tailgate party hosts to hire caterers who would dispense 
beer from kegs, according to a city staff report. The ordinance does not affect 
beer consumed from cans or bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Caterers would be required to "control the distribution of the beer, which 
should eliminate most of the problems currently experienced from unsupervised 
consumption of keg beer," according to the staff report. 
</P>
<P>
The move represents a step back from a previous proposal to ban beer kegs at 
the stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
That request surfaced earlier this year when SDSU representatives noted that 
beer served from kegs had resulted in "alcohol abuse at Aztec football games 
which results in numerous problems," according to the city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
Although the keg discussion focused on problems at Aztec football games, San 
Diego City Atty. John Witt ruled earlier that any action taken to limit beer 
consumption at the stadium would have to apply to all events. Consequently, the 
catering permit will also be required at tailgate parties hosted before or 
after Padres baseball and Chargers football games. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Police Department, during 1989 only three 
of 150,000 Aztec football fans who attended home games in 1989 were arrested 
for being drunk in public in the parking lot. Fewer than 30 minors were 
arrested for possession of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 2 million fans who attended Padres games during 1989, 16 people were 
arrested in the parking lot for being drunk in public. Two were arrested for 
driving while intoxicated and nearly 100 minors were arrested for illegally 
possessing alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Of 500,000 fans who attended Charger games in 1989, 10 were arrested in the 
parking lot for being drunk in public, according to police figures. Eleven 
minors were arrested for illegal possession of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The beer-keg prohibition is the latest in a string of efforts to reduce alcohol 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Stadium Authority and the council had previously prohibited fans from 
bringing alcohol into the stadium. Alcohol is no longer served after the 
seventh inning at Padres games, and beer sales are cut off after the beginning 
of the fourth quarter of Aztec and Charger games. Jumbo-sized beers are no 
longer served in the stadium, and the 28-ounce beer cup has been reduced to 22 
ounces.

A SPECTACULAR LIGHTNING SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: MORE ELECTRICAL STORMS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE COUNTY IN THE WAKE OF 
SUNDAY'S DAZZLING DISPLAY, WHICH SPARKED BRUSH FIRES. 
</P>

<P>
Lightning storms are expected to flash across San Diego County skies until 
Wednesday, with thunderstorms and warm, humid weather predicted for the rest of 
the week, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Warm, moist air flowed into San Diego over the weekend, resulting in a 
brilliant lightning storm late Sunday night, the second electrical storm of the 
summer, National Weather Service meteorologist Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"The activity was numerous and extremely brilliant. It was one of the most 
brilliant in San Diego over the last couple of years," said Shigehara, noting 
that the storm received the service's highest lightning-storm ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the popular time of the year for lightning activity," Shigehara said. 
"August and September are the favorite times of the year for these storms, but 
we're starting a little early." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Sunday storm produced high amounts of energy, pushing temperatures 
in some parts of North County into the 90s around midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric spokeswoman Barbara Burton reported that 14,000 
customers were without power Monday morning because of the lightning. Most 
power was restored by noon Monday, Ramona and northeast areas being the last to 
regain power. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the storm ignited at least one and possibly three brush fires in San 
Diego County. Shortly after 8 a.m. Monday, a quarter-acre of brush in the 
Cleveland National Forest in East County was blackened by fire sparked by the 
storm. It was contained by late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A 200-acre fire in Cuyamaca State Park and a 150-acre one north of the Viejas 
Indian Reservation in the Cleveland National Forest, both in East County, may 
have been started by lightning Monday, fire officials said. No structures were 
threatened by the blazes, but two firefighters battling the Cuyamaca blaze were 
taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with second-degree burns, and two others 
fighting the Viejas fire were injured. One suffered a broken arm and the other 
may have broken ribs, according to spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
More than 190 firefighters, 15 fire trucks, one bulldozer, five air tankers and 
one helicopter were called to battle the flames, spokeswoman Andrea Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
Campgrounds south of Green Valley Falls where the fire started were evacuated, 
and California 79 was temporarily closed, then reopened at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the fire had been contained in the river bottom, but 
firefighters have no estimate when it will be entirely extinguished because the 
area is heavily timbered, and winds are erratic, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
About 33% of the Viejas fire near the Viejas Grade had been contained by late 
Monday, and firefighters expected to extinguish the rest by morning, said U.S. 
Forest Service spokesman Edward McChesney. 
</P>
<P>
The service sent more than 250 firefighters, 10 engines, two helicopters and 
one bulldozer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego can expect partly cloudy skies today with less than a 20% chance of 
thundershowers and a high temperature of 81 and a low of 69. Thunderstorms 
throughout the week may contain frequent lightning, winds gusting up to 40 
m.p.h. and some heavy rains, the weather service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Warm and moist air from Mexico circulating around a high pressure centered over 
Nevada is bringing the thunderstorms to the area in what Shigehara calls the 
start of the nocturnal thunderstorm season. 
</P>
<P>
Weather through the week will continue being warm, humid and partly cloudy, 
with chances of thunderstorms in the mountains and deserts, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Extended temperature for the week are expected to range from highs of 78 to 81 
to lows of 66 to 72 downtown; highs of 72 to 77 and lows of 66 to 72 at the 
beaches; highs ranging from 85 to 95 in the inlands areas to lows 63 to 68; 
mountain highs 85 to 90, lows 55 to 65, and desert highs 105 to 112 and lows 75 
to 85. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said the lightning storm started in North County about 10 p.m. and 
spread to most of the county by midnight.

DOCTORS, LAWYERS RAISE FUNDS FOR FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Ventura County doctors and lawyers raised about $20,000 Monday at a 
reception to help Dianne Feinstein's campaign for governor, moving the 
Democratic nominee a small step closer to the $10-million campaign she says she 
needs to win. 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raiser, one of about a dozen Feinstein will attend this week, is part 
of the price of running for governor of the most populous state in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Feinstein raised $5.8 million through June 30, a tough battle for the 
party's nomination in the June primary left her with only $645,344 in cash. The 
Republican nominee, Sen. Pete Wilson, who had no significant primary 
challenger, had nearly $4 million in the bank as of the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's fund-raising reception was wedged into a quick, one-day campaign swing 
that began in Santa Barbara with a policy statement on Feinstein's opposition 
to offshore oil drilling and ended at the Ventura Harbor with a stump speech to 
union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big race," Feinstein said, urging more of the crowd of about 100 
lawyers and doctors to join her "cabinet" of $1,000 donors. "We don't just want 
your money, we want your knowledge, too." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those attending Monday's $100-a-person fund-raiser at the Tower Club in 
Oxnard were attorneys who handle workers' compensation claims or physicians who 
treat injured workers in Ventura County. The race is important to this group 
because the governor appoints administrators of the state workers' compensation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big fight against insurance companies and self-insured companies," said 
Louis Vigorita, a Ventura lawyer who joined Feinstein's 2,000-member group of 
big donors. He said Gov. George Deukmejian has disappointed doctors and lawyers 
in the field by not looking out for the interests of injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson would just be a rubber stamp of Deukmejian's policies," Vigorita 
said. "Dianne is our future. We are hoping as a new governor she will help us." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Monday night to labor leaders at the Harbortown Marina Resort in 
Ventura, Feinstein criticized Wilson, as a U.S. senator, for receiving "more 
contributions from the scandal-ridden savings and loan industry than anyone 
else in the entire Congress." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't believe California can afford to have a governor who is 
beholden to the savings and loan industry," Feinstein told members of the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has said it was unfair for Common Cause, a self-styled citizens lobby, 
to single him out as the top recipient of savings and loan political donations 
because he had to raise money for two elections during a period that most of 
his colleagues only ran for office once. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Wilson said he refused to intervene on behalf of savings and loan 
officials and he has opposed legislation to bail out the savings and loan 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
At a policy speech in Santa Barbara, Feinstein said she opposed offshore oil 
drilling and outlined several steps she would take as governor to protect the 
state's coast from the dangers of an oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would seek to extend state control over coastal waters from 
today's three-mile limit to 12 miles out to sea. In addition, she said, she 
supports establishing a $500-million fund from oil transport fees that could be 
used for immediate cleanup of any spill and restore areas contaminated by oil.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'TATTOOED RAPIST' SUSPECT WAIVES 
EXTRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man authorities allege is the so-called "Tattooed Rapist" sought by 
California authorities for 10 years waived extradition to California Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Everett Comstock, 46, appeared in U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Iowa and waived an extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said he will be transported to California within 10 days. Comstock 
was arrested Saturday in a Williams, Iowa, motel. Authorities said Comstock was 
apparently working as a farm laborer. 
</P>
<P>
He was wanted in connection with five rapes in California, including three in 
the Los Angeles area in 1980, one in San Luis Obispo in 1989 and another near 
Palm Springs, also in 1989. Authorities said he is also suspected of being 
involved in as many as 11 other sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker was dubbed the "Tattooed Rapist" because of several unusual 
tattoos described by victims.

RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES CUT WATER USE 10% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents and businesses in Camarillo and the Santa Rosa Valley have cut back 
their water consumption by more than 10% since May, city and Camrosa Water 
District officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks came in response to requests for conservation from the city of 
Camarillo, which serves the city's west end, and the Camrosa Water District, 
which serves water users in eastern Camarillo and the unincorporated Santa Rosa 
Valley northeast of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the continuing statewide drought, both the city and Camrosa were 
faced with reductions in their water supplies from the Metropolitan Water 
District in Los Angeles and local water pumped from underground. Both the city 
and Camrosa enacted ordinances last spring prohibiting water waste. 
</P>
<P>
John Elwell, Camarillo's director of community services, said officials are 
encouraged by the reductions since the ordinance was enacted April 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased, but it's important to recognize that we still have to keep our 
guards up. Three months is a very short period of time to establish a trend." 
</P>
<P>
Camrosa Water District General Manager Gina Manchester said people and 
businesses had been wonderful since the district requested the cutbacks and 
passed its ordinance May 11. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been very responsive to conservation programs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both ordinances forbid residents to allow water to run to waste and forbid lawn 
watering during daytime hours when water easily evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo water department inspectors have warned 251 water users they were 
violating the ordinance and fined five violators. Fines average about $17.50. 
</P>
<P>
Camrosa has warned about 300 people and fined about 20, Manchester said. Fines 
average about $10, but may increase, Manchester said.

The condition of a Santa Paula man who was stabbed 18 times has improved from 
critical to guarded, a Ventura County Medical Center nursing supervisor said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Avelino Morales, 28, was admitted to the hospital late Friday after the knife 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
But the identity of the assailants who repeatedly knifed Morales remains a 
mystery, Santa Paula Police Cmdr. Bob Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales was walking with a friend at 10:29 p.m. Friday in the 1200 block of 
East Ventura Street when they were approached by two men in their mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
Morales was stabbed in the chest, back and both legs. The two attackers fled on 
foot, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are not revealing the name of Morales' friend out of concern that he may 
be attacked in retaliation for his testimony, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers have been unable to determine whether a gang was involved in the 
stabbing because Morales' friend could not identify the attackers by name, 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police plan to interview Morales when he is released from the hospital, 
Gonzalez said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

BURGLARY BARS ARE SYMBOLS OF CHANGE

<P>
New steel bars cover the door to Tony's Indian Art Gallery in downtown Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Tony Moore said they are symbols of change in the resort town, where he 
has lived for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Within a recent two-week period, both Moore's Ojai home and business were 
burglarized. More than $14,500 worth of American Indian jewelry and hand-carved 
knives were taken from Moore's gallery at 602 E. Ojai Ave., he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the largest commercial thefts in Ojai Valley in recent years, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Don Cunningham said he is not surprised to see 
bars go up on the store. "Ojai could look like downtown Oxnard in five years," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of commercial burglaries in Ojai rose by 31% last year, nine more 
than the 29 reported in 1988, the Sheriff's Department reported. Vehicle 
burglaries rose by 60% last year over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A three-hour vandalism spree in Ojai last week resulted in broken windows at 
five businesses and $30,000 in damage to four public schools, said Ojai Unified 
School District Supt. Andrew Smidt, who authorized a $1,000 reward for 
information leading to arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai authorities said these could be isolated incidents rather than an 
indication that a major crime wave is sweeping the city of 7,946 residents. 
Residential burglaries were down by 21%, with six fewer than the 29 reported in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
But that is little comfort, Moore said. "People in Ojai need to wake up and 
realize we are going to become victims. 
</P>
<P>
"They think we're surrounded and protected by these mountains, but the road 
goes both ways," Moore said of California 33, the main link between Ojai and 
the rest of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a Lakota Sioux Indian who owns the gallery with his wife, Rosie, of 
Chumash Indian descent, operated the shop for five years without bars, an alarm 
system or any thefts except occasional shoplifting. He said he occasionally 
forgot to lock the door and would find customers inside when he returned, but 
nothing missing. 
</P>
<P>
But July 21, he found a display case had been smashed with rocks. Shards of 
Southwest Indian pottery littered the floor. About 250 pieces of Navajo, Hopi 
and Zuni silver and turquoise jewelry and hand-carved knives were missing, 
Moore said, along with several hundred dollars from the register. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the door all smashed, and when I peeked in, I dropped the hides I was 
carrying," Moore said. "I just wanted to sit down and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Ojai detectives said they have several leads but have made no arrests. THIA

OLD COASTER READY TO ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 65 years after its inaugural run in 1925 on the Fourth of July, the 
Giant Dipper roller coaster is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
The historic wooden coaster in Belmont Park reopens to the public today at 
about 1 p.m. after surviving many demolition threats and undergoing a 
$1.2-million restoration by the San Diego Seaside Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all ready," said Belmont Park spokeswoman Judi Lapin. "It's actually 
moving." 
</P>
<P>
A ride on the coaster will cost $2. It will be open during the summer from 11 
a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, except Friday and Saturday when it will run until 11 
p.m., said Tim Cole, an assistant manager for the company. The hours will be 
scaled back during spring, fall and winter months. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few weeks, Cole said, the coaster won't open until about 2 p.m. 
every day so that painters and carpenters can finish cosmetic touch-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Coaster officials promise a two-minute, hair-raising ride aboard the Giant 
Dipper, as the six-car, steel and fiberglass train whips around half a mile of 
track, taking riders down 13 drops. It hits a top speed of 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic," said Cole, who rode the coaster during a test run. 
</P>
<P>
Replaced during restoration were all 2,600 feet of the wood-and-steel track, 
all 28,973 bolts and much of the coaster's Douglas fir frame. The coaster was 
designated a landmark last month by the National Park Service. DEANNA BELLANDI

COURT REJECTS FILIPINOS' U.S. CITIZENSHIP BID 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred Filipinos who served in the U.S. Navy at the time of the 
Grenada invasion were denied naturalization as U.S. citizens Monday. A federal 
appeals court ruled that an executive order by then-President Ronald Reagan was 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a case from San 
Diego affects Navy recruits from the Philippines, who need not be U.S. 
residents. Other non-citizen members of the armed forces must be permanent 
legal residents of the United States and therefore are eligible for 
naturalization after three years of service. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan issued an order in 1987 saying all non-citizen veterans who served in 
Grenada and adjacent islands during the nine-day U.S. invasion in October and 
November 1983 were eligible for naturalization, under a law covering 
foreign-born combat veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said the order was invalid because, as the government has now 
conceded, the law authorized a President to declare only a time period for 
citizenship eligibility, and not to specify geographic areas of service. 
</P>
<P>
But the court also agreed with the government that the invalid designation of 
geographic areas could not be removed from the order, which would make all 
non-citizens in the armed services during the period eligible for 
naturalization. Instead, the court said, the order was entirely illegal and 
made no one eligible. 
</P>
<P>
It is "apparent that the President would not have signed this order had he 
known it would encompass those aliens serving in the military in other 
geographical locations unrelated to the Grenada invasion," said the opinion by 
Judge Stephen Trott. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling upheld an earlier decision in the case by U.S. District Judge Earl 
B. Gilliam of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It rejected an appeal by Arthur Espineli Reyes, a native of the Philippines who 
was recruited into the Navy in 1981, remains on active duty and is not a 
permanent legal resident of the United States. He was stationed in San Diego at 
the time of the Grenada invasion and was not called into combat. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Robert Mautino, estimated that several hundred Filipinos, mainly in 
San Diego and Los Angeles, are in the same situation. 
</P>
<P>
"They're subject to all of the military discipline that any American is subject 
to, all the risks of being killed or put in danger," Mautino said. "But they 
don't get the benefits that Congress actually intended them to get . . . just 
because the President made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
He said the government's lawyer indicated during oral arguments in May that 
foreign-born veterans who had actually served in Grenada had probably already 
taken advantage of Reagan's order and become citizens. Though the order has 
been declared illegal, it seems unlikely that the government would move to 
revoke their naturalization, Mautino said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law makes eligible for citizenship any alien who serves honorably in 
active duty in the U.S. armed forces during a time that the President 
designates as a period of combat. 
</P>
<P>
Mautino argued that the law was intended to benefit anyone serving in the armed 
forces at the time and might therefore have been sent into a combat area. But 
Trott said the argument did not fit a brief engagement like the Grenada 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast to the major conflicts, there was little chance that any service 
personnel not originally sent to Grenada would be sent there during those nine 
days," the judge said. "Such a limited involvement does not appear to be the 
scenario Congress had in mind when the decision was made to include all 
servicemen within a particular time period."

MINISTERS DENOUNCE SUSPECTS' TREATMENT IN SLAYING OF PASTOR; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE INITIAL DECISION TO GRANT BAIL TO THE TWO WHITE TEEN-AGERS IS 
BRANDED AS 'LETHAL RACISM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of ministers and community activists from the northeast San Fernando 
Valley on Monday angrily denounced the initial granting of $20,000 bail to two 
teen-agers charged in the shooting death of a Pacoima pastor. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the granting of bail last week to the two suspects, who are 
both white, in the death of Carl White, 54, the black minister of the Apostolic 
Temple Church, was "lethal racism." White was shot to death at his Chatsworth 
home July 28, allegedly during a dispute over a minor traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually low bail for murder charges was set Thursday for Dana Singer, 18, 
and Phil Dimenno, 19, both of Northridge, when police and prosecutors thought 
that the suspects had no prior criminal records. Both youths lived with their 
parents and were not a threat to flee or endanger the public, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the next day, police discovered the pair had allegedly used stolen 
credit cards in the past and both had been cited earlier this year when they 
were caught trespassing at a city park while armed. 
</P>
<P>
The low bail order was vacated and both suspects are now being held without 
bail pending their Aug. 13 arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve members of the Ministers' Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley 
held a press conference Monday to criticize the Los Angeles police, the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office and San Fernando Municipal 
Commissioner Richard L. Brand, who accepted the bail recommendation of the 
prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The life of Pastor White was treated with cheapness in the shallow background 
investigation done by the Police Department," said the Rev. James V. Lyles, 
president of the ministers' group. "The D.A.'s office acted with total 
disregard for life in recommending such low bail, and Commissioner Brand 
committed utter contempt for Pastor White, his family and this community by 
accepting such recommendation from the D.A. 
</P>
<P>
"The rationale for low bail is laced with lethal racism. If two black men had 
wantonly and in cold blood killed a white man, they would not have been let 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
The ministers said they will ask Board of Supervisors and the American Civil 
Liberties Union to investigate the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a total breakdown, step by step," said Fred Taylor, a community 
activist who took part in the press conference. "Obviously, the entire system 
worked for the betterment of the two alleged murderers." 
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the suspects should never have received bail, even if they 
had no prior record as authorities initially thought. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office denied that the suspects received better 
treatment because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Billy D. Webb, chief prosecutor in the San Fernando office, 
said he made the decision to allow the bail amount to be set at $20,000 because 
of numerous reasons regarding the suspects and the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We never discussed the color of the victim nor the defendants," Webb said. 
"That had nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Webb and Deputy Dist. Atty. Leland B. Harris said that at the time bail was 
being considered, prosecutors knew of no prior record of criminal activity by 
the suspects. Both teen-agers have long-term ties to the community and were not 
believed to be dangerous. The prosecutors were also faced with the perplexing 
motive for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It was based on stupidity more than anything else," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors decided to deviate from the routine schedule used by the district 
attorney's office and allow bail to be set. They said the suspects' attorneys 
played no part in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after police turned up a record of a misdemeanor citation issued to 
Singer in May by a park ranger that authorities had evidence of any prior 
criminal activity involving the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"We then took appropriate action," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to comment on the ministers' charges, but prosecutors said that 
detectives did not find the citation issued to Singer during routine computer 
checks for criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
"They were still investigating because the reason for this it was so bizarre," 
Webb said. "They kept digging and came up with the additional information about 
them."

SHIELDED LIGHTS HELP COLLEGE OBSERVATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark College officials are overseeing the final stages of a project that 
would keep the sky over the campus dim enough to observe the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
The project to install 94 light shields in the college parking lot is almost 
over, just in time for one of the biggest meteor showers of the year. 
</P>
<P>
An evening show is scheduled Saturday at the college observatory. 
</P>
<P>
The encroachment of development and the resulting light pollution has been a 
longtime concern for members of the Moorpark College astronomy faculty, 
instructor Hal Jandorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Installing shields took a year to bring about and costs the college about $51 a 
shield, or $4,794, said astronomy instructor Charles Townsend. The shields 
deflect the light downward, away from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
While the installation of shields on lampposts at Moorpark College alleviates 
the surrounding light problem, the orange glow of lights from nearby Simi 
Valley threatens to extinguish nighttime observations in coming years, Jandorf 
said. Light rays from ground sources obstruct the viewing of celestial objects 
through telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
"For Moorpark, the observatory itself will be useless in 10 years, except for 
looking at the moon and sun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the public shows, the astronomy program runs evening 
laboratories every day of the week, in which students peer through 13-inch 
telescopes into deep space. 
</P>
<P>
Although the shields will work as a temporary solution to the light problem in 
the parking lot, Jandorf predicted that the glow emanating from newly installed 
stadium lights on the other side of the campus may also force astronomy 
instructors to reschedule their evening programs so that they do not conflict 
with sports events. PSYCHE PASCUAL

CASTAIC RESIDENTS FEAR IMPACT OF MAJOR INDUSTRIAL PARK ON QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patricia Elward and her family moved to a secluded street near Castaic six 
months ago to escape a noisy boulevard in Reseda where trucks rumbled by their 
home day and night, shaking the house as they passed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had cracks all down my ceilings and walls," Elward said of her old house. 
Today, Elward fears she may be in for much of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Elward, her husband and two young sons live in Live Oak, a housing tract a few 
miles north of Six Flags Magic Mountain near the proposed Valencia Commercial 
Center, a giant industrial park planned by the Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. 
for 1,436 acres west of the Golden State Freeway and north of California 126. 
</P>
<P>
The county Regional Planning Commissioners, who will hold a hearing on Newhall 
Land's proposal Wednesday, toured the site Monday in response to complaints 
from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
A major entrance to the park, Backer Road, would pass directly behind Elward's 
home. She and other members of the Live Oak Community Assn. say they are 
concerned about noise, traffic and the possible dangers of locating 
manufacturing plants within 750 feet of homes and an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Freeman, president of the homeowners association, charged Monday that 
parts of the project's environmental impact report, such as a noise study, were 
based on incomplete data. The group has compiled 64 pages of complaints 
challenging the findings and methodology of the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land, said the project is well 
planned, would not harm the nearby homes and would benefit the surrounding 
Santa Clarita Valley by creating as many as 20,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park would have 12 million square feet of manufacturing and 
office space and would house only clean industries compatible with the area, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major tenants will be the U.S. Postal Service, which purchased 62.4 
acres for a $26.8-million processing center to handle mail in northern Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land already has received permission to begin grading about 100 acres 
of industrial land adjacent to the proposed park, and giant earthmovers kicked 
up clouds of dust as they carried loads of dirt across the barren site Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the chief concerns of homeowners is Backer Road, which currently comes to 
a dead-end behind a row of houses. Backer Road, which connects to The Old Road, 
would be extended in a long arc until it reached California 126 to the south, 
cutting through the length of the industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land wants to widen Backer Road from two lanes to four and possibly six 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to appease homeowners, Newhall Land has offered to move Backer 
Road 40 feet north, build extra berms to cut down noise and erect a bridge for 
pedestrians. Freeman called the offer unacceptable, saying an alternate route 
should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents are angry not only at Newhall Land for proposing the park, but 
at other developers and real estate brokers who, the residents insist, never 
told home buyers that a major industrial park was planned next door. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved here six months ago and I was never told," Elward said. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept it hush-hush," said Paul Ball, another resident. 
</P>
<P>
Local home builders, meanwhile, have been assuring homeowners in recent weeks 
that they too were unaware of Newhall Land's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Lauffer countered that "it's certainly been no secret on our part." 
</P>
<P>
She said Newhall Land has been working on the project for a decade, noting the 
industrial park was the focal point of a two-year effort to revise the Castaic 
General Plan, which acts as a broad blueprint for development. 
</P>
<P>
The general plan designated the industrial park site, once farmland, as 
suitable for industry. That plan was approved by the Regional Planning 
Commission two years ago after lengthy and often well-attended hearings. 
</P>
<P>
When the debate over the industrial park is finally over, many residents will 
want real estate brokers and developers to explain why they failed to disclose 
the plans for the industrial park, Elward said. If her family had known, she 
said, they never would have purchased their home in Live Oak. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how many lawsuits are going to result from what happened here," she 
said.

WOOD RANCH SCHOOL PLANS TO BE SHOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for a new $5.5-million elementary school in Wood Ranch are scheduled to 
be presented tonight to the Simi Valley school board. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed facility is being touted as a model school, complete with built-in 
television monitors and videotape machines in every classroom and several 
common areas. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the 34,000-square-foot school, designed by the Blurock Partnership in 
Newport Beach, recently won an honor award from the Orange County American 
Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Ken Ashton said that, although the district has four closed 
elementary schools, it would be less expensive to open a new school because the 
entire cost will be paid by the developer of Wood Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
A model of the school will be presented tonight to Simi Valley Unified School 
District board members, who will vote on the design drawings. Officials 
approved the schematic design in May. 
</P>
<P>
The public portion of tonight's meeting, to be held at district headquarters, 
will begin about 8 p.m. after school board members get out of a closed session, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of Wood Ranch, Olympia-Roberts Corp., has agreed to build and 
outfit the new elementary school, district officials said. The cost is 
estimated at $5.5 million, including $250,000 for computer and technical 
equipment, project designer Jim Kisel said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-classroom school, to be built on Circle Knoll Drive near Grass Valley 
Street, will accommodate 500 students. 
</P>
<P>
The classrooms will be wired so that newer technology can be installed as it 
becomes available. Construction is expected to begin in the spring of 1991 with 
an opening date in the fall of 1992, officials said. STEPHANIE STASSEL

CANOGA PARK HIGH CHEERLEADERS SCORE V-I-C-T-O-R-Y IN INTERNATIONAL CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giddy with the thrill of victory and hungry for American fast food, 13 members 
of the Canoga Park High School cheerleading squad arrived home Monday after 
winning first prize in an international competition in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We made history," said an exuberant Tisa Dixon, noting that Canoga Park High 
was the first American squad to win the co-ed cheerleading contest, sponsored 
jointly by the government of Japan and the city of Nagoya, where the event was 
held. The competition, dubbed Miss Drill Team International, takes its name 
from the title given the contestant judged best female cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
In two performances during the eight-day trip, Canoga Park was judged superior 
in its division, which also included eight teams from Canada, Japan and 
England, squad members said. Sixty-three high school squads from throughout 
Europe, Asia, North America and Australia competed in 12 divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The local squad qualified for the invitational competition by winning a 
national contest, called Miss Drill Team USA, in which about 200 high school 
teams competed in Los Angeles earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park students who raised $900 each in travel funds participated in the 
international competition, said coach Carolyn Purkey. Members held a garage 
sale, solicited donations and attended television game shows as paid audience 
members. 
</P>
<P>
As the teen-agers walked out the gate of Los Angeles International Airport and 
into a crowd of proud parents and friends, their stomachs were first on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We want American food is what we want," said senior John Call, one of four 
male cheerleaders and a lineman on the Canoga Park football team. "Hamburgers. 
Big Gulps." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Drill Team International is the latest in a series of competitions the 
Canoga Park squad has won over the past three years. The cheerleaders won the 
state championships in 1989 and in 1990, and placed high in the national 
championships for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Purkey attributed the team's recent success to the 1987 addition of male 
cheerleaders to the squad. The boys' strength has enabled the squad to perform 
acrobatic stunts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Ferris, senior quarterback for the Canoga Park football team and a rookie 
cheerleader, said the squad's trophy collection silenced friends who mocked him 
for participating in a traditionally female sport. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a little flak, but they start to appreciate it more and more," said 
Ferris, who added that he would forsake cheerleading this fall to play 
football. "It's a lot harder than you think. I'm in better shape now than I was 
during football season."

OFFICER THOUGHT QUICKLY AT WRONG END OF GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing in the middle of a San Diego motel robbery, off-duty Officer Robert 
Ray Barr decided he would die if he handed over his wallet. It carried his 
Huntington Beach police badge. 
</P>
<P>
So he lied, claiming it was in his car. Then, as a pair of bandits trained a 
12-gauge shotgun on him and six other people, Barr managed to toss the wallet 
unnoticed under a chair. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he lay on the floor, face down, the bandits persisted. They wanted to 
know what was in his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
He showed them, pulling out a .22-caliber handgun and firing a single round. He 
missed, police said Monday, and was wounded twice by the return fire. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought they would kill him if they knew he was a cop," said San Diego 
Police Lt. Paul Ybarrando, one of several officers investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing he wasn't killed," Ybarrando said. "The guy was standing over him 
with a shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
Barr, an accident reconstruction expert and 13-year Huntington Beach officer 
who turned 43 today, was reported in fair condition Monday in the intensive 
care unit of Sharp Memorial Hospital. He suffered leg and arm wounds in the gun 
battle, which unfolded late Saturday in the lobby of the Hampton Inn on Kearny 
Mesa Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although at least half a dozen people lay sprawled near the officer, no one 
else was injured in the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarrando said Barr "was basically forced into reacting. The wise thing he 
intended to do was to be a heck of a good witness after it was all over. But he 
had to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego detectives are investigating the shooting, which occurred about 10:30 
p.m. Saturday after the two masked robbers invaded the motel as Barr was 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Barr, who had spent the day at the San Diego Zoo with his fiancee and two 
teen-age daughters, left them in the car and inquired about a room. The inn was 
booked, and, as he walked toward the door, two men wearing white masks stormed 
into the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
One vaulted over the front counter; the other trained a shotgun on the victims. 
The gunman ordered Barr and the others to lie face down on the floor. The 
robbers seized the motel's receipts -- police refused to disclose the loss -- 
as well as the wallets of the desk clerk and the other people in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
From a half-kneeling position, Ybarrando said, Barr fired one round at the 
bandit. He thought he had hit him, but evidence indicates he did not, Ybarrando 
said. The gunman fired back at close range, striking Barr once in the leg, 
severing an artery. Barr fell face down. The gunman fired again, wounding Barr 
in the left arm. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits, described as about 6 feet tall and wearing dark clothing with 
white sheets or scarfs cloaking their faces, ran out the front door and hopped 
a fence of a neighboring hotel. Ybarrando said no vehicle was seen. 
</P>
<P>
One of Barr's daughters flagged down a passing policeman as Barr's fiancee, a 
nurse whom police would not identify, applied a tourniquet to his leg. 
</P>
<P>
Barr underwent surgery Saturday night to repair his arm wounds and nerve damage 
to his leg. His condition was upgraded from critical to fair Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The gun Barr fired was not his service revolver, Huntington Beach Police Lt. 
Jeff Cope said; officers from that department are armed with larger-caliber 
weapons. The department's officers are allowed to carry guns off duty and, in 
fact, are expected in their own time to perform as officers of the law if 
necessary, Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not required that an officer carry a gun off duty," Cope said, but "it's 
almost an unwritten rule. You almost have to these days." 
</P>
<P>
Cope, who has worked with Barr since Barr joined the department, said that, to 
his knowledge, Barr has never been involved in a shooting, on or off duty. 
</P>
<P>
He described Barr as "very well-liked" and mild-mannered.

EDDIE (TIGER) HOLOHAN; RETIRED AIRPORT OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie (Tiger) Holohan, a retired Los Angeles Department of Airports official, 
has died in Granada Hills. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Holohan was the administrative assistant to the general manager of the 
Department of Airports from 1970 until his retirement in 1986.

A longtime Granada Hills resident, he died Sunday of heart failure following a 
lengthy battle with heart problems, said his wife, Ellen Holohan. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, he was a civilian aerobatic flight instructor for the Army 
Air Force in Miami and was appointed by President Harry Truman to serve as 
chief of aviation in Puerto Rico, a position he held for four years. Holohan 
later worked in Washington as the director of public relations for the Flying 
Tiger Line Inc. and was transfered to California in 1958. He worked with the 
airline cargo company until he was hired by the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Holohan also served as president of the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce 
from 1965 to 1967 and president of the Aero Club of Southern California from

JIM MURRAY: SILK PURSE BECAME SOW'S EAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For decades, the cry has gone up in baseball, "Break Up The Yankees!" 
</P>
<P>
They were stifling the game. They were one of the most hated organizations in 
the world, ranked alongside the Krupp Works in Germany, the warlords in China, 
the Cossacks in Russia. They weren't a team, they were a monarchy. The 
Hapsburgs of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
They were haughty, imperious, overbearing. They really weren't an athletic 
hegemony, they were an economic hegemony. They made more money on the side than 
other franchises did on ticket sales. One year, 1934, the New York Yankees drew 
81,000 to an afternoon doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers. That was 1,000 
more than the St. Louis Browns drew for that entire season. 
</P>
<P>
If two teams were bidding for a star prospect and one of them was the Yankees, 
there was very little doubt where the athlete would go. The Yankees could even 
offer him less. He would make it up in World Series checks. 
</P>
<P>
Their symbol, fittingly, was a top hat. Between 1921 and 1964, they won 29 
pennants and World Series championships were almost automatic. They won World 
Series games by scores of 18-4, 12-6, 13-5. Those weren't games, they were 
batting practices. 
</P>
<P>
They usually kept the same manager throughout their streaks -- Miller Huggins 
in the '20s, Joe McCarthy in the '30s and '40s, Casey Stengel in the '50s. 
Their owner was a German brewer who spoke with a heavy accent and called the 
great Babe "Root." 
</P>
<P>
They made a travesty of the game, as the saying goes. Watching a Yankee game 
was like watching a guy pulling wings off a butterfly. For sickos. 
</P>
<P>
And then, someone finally came along and broke up the Yankees! 
</P>
<P>
You'd think they'd give him a ticker-tape parade. The keys to every city in the 
league. Instant installation in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Know what they did? Kicked him out of the game, is what they did! Suspended 
him. Stripped him of his epaulets. Threw him out the front door. Ordered him 
into exile. 
</P>
<P>
Is that any way to treat a public benefactor of this magnitude? 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner should be a statue in every ballpark in the country. 
Instead, I'm not sure he dares show his face. 
</P>
<P>
George did what the game couldn't do in 43 years -- broke up the Yankees. He 
turned a once-proud franchise into a collection of clods. He made them the 
laughingstock of the grand old game. He lost the town to the Mets -- the Mets! 
-- and he lost the game to a lot of bozos the Yankees used to beat regularly 
like a gong. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy. The Yankees took a lot of breaking up. They went down like the 
Ottoman Empire. The dismantling required a lot of concentrating. 
</P>
<P>
George was equal to it. He began by discharging managers, throwing them out the 
door like drunks in a waterfront bar at 2 a.m. He never really gave anybody a 
chance to even know his players. George didn't really want a strong manager. 
George saw it as a ventriloquist act. When a manager talked, you could see 
George's lips move. 
</P>
<P>
He bought players for reputation, not prowess. He lucked out with Reggie 
Jackson. Reggie came with a pennant attached, like Babe Ruth or Mickey Mantle. 
Other acquisitions came with fifth place attached. 
</P>
<P>
He had a team of strangers. They were like passengers in the same plane. 
Yankees in the past didn't like each other sometimes. But they knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
George didn't take much out of the Yankees -- just their soul. 
</P>
<P>
But where was he when we needed him? Where was he when they were swallowing 
baseball whole, when a World Series had about as much suspense as a drowning? 
</P>
<P>
Still, you might say George opened up the game. Even unwittingly, he broke up 
the Yankee monopoly as effectively as a Justice Department task force busting 
up a cartel. The Yankees are only a shell of their former selves, and we have 
George Steinbrenner to thank. 
</P>
<P>
And what thanks does he get? Out! There's the door! Never darken it again! 
</P>
<P>
Tsk, tsk! That's gratitude for you. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, George didn't set off on this trust-busting venture as a public 
service. It just kind of happened. 
</P>
<P>
Poor George! You see, I think I have a handle on George's problem. George never 
properly grasped the fundamental character of baseball. George's background was 
all in football, first at his alma mater, Williams College, then at Ohio State, 
where he worshipped at the knee of Woody Hayes, no less. Then, he was an 
assistant coach at Northwestern and Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
George thought baseball could be run like football -- locker room pep talks, 
motivational programs, pom-pons, cheerleading. He never caught onto the basic 
precept that baseball, unlike football, is not a team game, it's a series of 
solo performances. 
</P>
<P>
That's why you don't have to pump up a baseball player any more than you do an 
opera star. You might have to put some fight in an interior lineman in 
football. After all, nobody knows what he's doing on any given play except the 
coach assigned to him. He can dog it. 
</P>
<P>
But a baseball player is like a guy doing his aria or a tap dance in a 
spotlight. The last thing he wants to do is humiliate himself. He doesn't need 
any fight talks, any pleas, any exhortations to win one for the old Gipper or 
someone's sick aunt in Peoria. If he can knock that ball out of the lot, he 
will. Even if his mother is pitching. The last time anybody made out in 
baseball because he wasn't doing his best up there was in the 1919 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
None of George's shtick worked in baseball. He simply never really got the hang 
of it. Sarcasm, threats, tantrums, backdoor punishments -- none of them ever 
worked a better performance. George thought it was going to be like Notre Dame- 
Army. Michigan vs. Ohio State. Pure emotion. It was more like an orchestrated, 
set-piece war. Baseball calls for careful, rational, deliberate thought, not 
runaway adrenaline flow. 
</P>
<P>
Still, George broke up the Yankees, didn't he? The game owes him that. Even the 
Red Sox sneak into an occasional pennant now. The old St. Louis Browns, now the 
Baltimore Orioles, even do it. 
</P>
<P>
They booted George out for giving $40,000 to some character who bets the horses 
and eats with his hat on. I guess that's a no-no. Baseball is getting quite 
sanctimonious. 
</P>
<P>
So, George is out of here after all he's done. Well, sort of. I think he 
appointed his son in his place. I guess because his chauffeur was busy. 
</P>
<P>
So I don't have too much worry that the Yankees will claw their way back to the 
throne. Funny, but I get the feeling George will still find a way to keep those 
good men down. He always has. 
</P>
<P>
But what if he can't? What if some management comes along and restores the 
Yanks to their old-time tyranny? 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner of baseball said he ran George out in "the best interests of 
the game." We'll be the judge of that, commissioner. Particularly if the Yanks 
come back to win World Series games, 18-4. We may be begging George to come 
back and break them up again -- in the best interests of the game.

Since Len Bias' cocaine-induced death, the University of Maryland athletic 
program has nearly collapsed, following a trend of hiring successful, respected 
coaches and athletic directors and bringing out their worst. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is reeling from another blow to its downward spiraling athletic 
program Friday, when the NCAA announced it would not lessen severe sanctions 
levied against the university in May. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was the most recent episode of a saga that has seen the resignation 
of two basketball coaches, two athletic directors and a president, and that has 
left the university with a projected budget deficit of $2.6 million for the 
upcoming academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Before Bias' death, Maryland was considered one of the top athletic programs in 
the country, producing nationally competitive teams and showcasing such 
athletic talents as Boomer Esiason, Buck Williams, Adrian Branch, John Lucas, 
Renaldo Nehemiah and Ferrell Edmunds. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Terrapins have been a case study in ongoing mismanagement that 
was brought to a head in March when the university was sanctioned by the NCAA 
for a lack of institutional control over its athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
A yearlong NCAA investigation into allegations of basketball recruiting 
violations and other improprieties found the university in violation of 13 NCAA 
rules, the most serious of which included scalping complimentary Atlantic Coast 
Conference basketball tournament tickets, giving greatly discounted clothing to 
recruits and giving a loan and transportation to a former player who was trying 
to regain his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
For that, the NCAA put the basketball program on three years' probation; 
prohibited postseason play through the 1991-92 season; prohibited television 
appearances during the 1990-91 season, effectively eliminating the Terrapins 
from the ACC tournament; and ordered the forfeiture of $361,000 for their 
participation in the 1988 NCAA tournament. The NCAA also ordered a reduction in 
the number of scholarships from 15 to 13 through the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions went way beyond what they should have been, given our total 
cooperation, our absence of any violation in the past and the fact that 
everyone named in the charges had left the institution," said Maryland 
President Dr. William Kirwan. "They sent the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I've gotten some calls (from other schools) on that very point. 
They've asked if they should cooperate (in NCAA investigations) to the extent 
that we did. I can understand why it would give other schools some pause. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative is to hire an expensive lawyer and cut off communication (with 
the NCAA) and treat it as a totally adversarial relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their recent problems, Maryland administrators are saying that last 
week's denial of the appeal marks the turning of a page in the school's 
history, that the university now can begin to put its problems behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland has pitched the same "new leaf" idea after every hiring or resignation 
over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA is conducting another investigation of Maryland, this one concerning 
the report that basketball Coach Gary Williams observed a practice before the 
official Oct. 15 starting date last season. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is still out on Maryland, and may be for some time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEFTY DRIESELL 
</P>
<P>
Charles G. (Lefty) Driesell coached Maryland basketball for 17 years, and in 
his final seasons at Maryland was able to successfully recruit Len Bias, who 
went on to become one of college basketball's great players. Someone said, 
"Watch Len Bias play once, love him forever." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-8, Bias was an indomitable ball of energy, capable of carrying a team 
single-handedly. Drive the lane, slam dunks, double-pump fakes, sink 
three-pointers -- Bias could do it all. His presence alone gave his Terrapins 
an advantage, since the opposition would surely have to double- or triple-team 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Bias was selected by the Boston Celtics in the first round of 
the 1986 NBA draft, then came to a handshake agreement on a $1.6-million, 
five-year endorsement contract with Reebok shoes the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Bias returned to College Park from Boston that night for a private party at his 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Terry Long and David Gregg and friend Brian Tribble met Bias at his 
dormitory on the South side of the campus at about 3 a.m. Shortly afterword, 
the group began snorting cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Long and Gregg said later that they warned Bias not to snort too much, but that 
he didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, Bias had a seizure, dropped to the floor, lost consciousness 
and regained it. Then he had a second seizure and still another. Long tried 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:32 a.m., Tribble called 911, and at 8:50 a.m., on June 19, 1986, Bias was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy later determined that cocaine had interrupted the electrical 
activity to Bias' brain, ending the flow of signals to the heart and causing it 
to stop beating. 
</P>
<P>
Police and reporters scrambled to uncover the details of Bias' death, and bit 
by bit the story unfolded of the dormitory party and of Bias' alleged 
occasional drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The community -- at first surprised, and hurt by Bias' death -- became 
impatient, demanding answers quicker than investigators could find and assemble 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of Bias' death, the university and its students were drawn into the 
investigation, taking questions from community leaders, the police -- and even 
their own parents. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Koppel did his "Nightline" show from the top of Cole Field House and papers 
all over the country carried pictures of more than 10,000 students and fans 
mourning during a memorial tribute to Bias. During that memorial at Cole Field 
House, state flags flew at half staff and Jesse Jackson and others spoke of the 
tremendous potential Bias had shown. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after his death, things began falling apart for the athletic 
department. It started with the resignation of an academic counselor for the 
basketball team, who said she believed education was not Driesell's top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, in the spring semester of 1986, five of 
Driesell's 12 players had flunked out of school. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the reports further showed, one in 10 Maryland athletes flunked out 
every semester, then reapplied for admission, took the classes he had failed 
over again in summer school and continued to play without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
On July 9, John Smialek, the state medical examiner, announced that Bias had 
died a "cocaine-induced" death. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the evidence that had been leading to that conclusion, Smialek's 
announcement fell on the Maryland community like a lead weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, parents were explaining drugs and death to their small children, 
many of whom had included Bias in their bedtime prayers and had hung his 
posters on their walls. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury investigation ensued but no charges were brought, and, on the 
advice of their attorneys, Driesell, his coaches and the players involved 
declined to answer reporters' questions. It was then reported that Bias had 
rarely attended classes in the spring semester and that he was still 21 credits 
-- seven classes -- short of graduation in May. 
</P>
<P>
With that revelation, Maryland's academic policies came under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Kitty Saylor, a one-time graduate teaching assistant, told the 
Washington Post that, at the request of Ken Vreeland, an academic counselor, 
she had changed an an F grade to an incomplete for basketball player Adrian 
Branch in the summer of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the situation was growing worse. There were far more questions than 
answers, and adding to the distrust were students, coaches and counselors 
refusing to speak to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Then, four months after Bias' death, athletic director Dick Dull resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Dull said that he had been thinking about leaving for some time but Bias' death 
and the mess that followed probably made his decision much easier. 
</P>
<P>
Driesell was next. 
</P>
<P>
He was an icon. Driesell never had a losing season at Maryland, had 16 seasons 
of 20-plus victories and built a 349-159 record, including one ACC title. 
Maryland was a conference and national power and it had Driesell to thank. 
</P>
<P>
His swaying walk and slow drawl made him colorful, and his court tantrums and 
passionate love for the game and the student body gave him charisma. He was 
brash and outrageous, a joy to root for. 
</P>
<P>
But during the grand jury investigation, there were unproved allegations that 
Driesell had been part of a cover-up, instructing his players to clean up Bias' 
room the morning of his death. That, and the academic problems enveloping the 
basketball team, all pushed Driesell nearer to the doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on Oct. 29, Driesell, flanked by his wife and two 
daughters, stood before more than 200 reporters and cameraman, announcing that 
he was resigning to accept a position as assistant athletic director in charge 
of promotion and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
It was a facade and everyone knew it. 
</P>
<P>
In April of '88, he was hired as coach at James Madison University in 
Harrisonburg, Va. In two seasons there, Driesell has gone 36-25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOB WADE 
</P>
<P>
The day after Driesell's resignation, Maryland Chancellor John Slaughter 
announced the hiring of Bob Wade as basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland was rid of Dull and Driesell -- both of whom had been in the spotlight 
during the lengthy Bias investigation -- and the hiring of Wade was welcomed as 
a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that he had the kind of sensitivity to deal with the needs of the 
young men in the basketball program," said Slaughter, now president of 
Occidental College. "At the time, they'd been a pretty besieged group and they 
needed someone who had discipline and who in addition had proved he was a solid 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"But I failed to put the kind of support network around (Wade) that any coach 
would have needed." 
</P>
<P>
Wade was the first black Division I basketball or football coach in the ACC, 
and, although all his coaching experience was at the high school level, he was 
a winner. 
</P>
<P>
He had compiled a 341-25 record at Dunbar High School in Baltimore, including 
five national top-10 and three No. 1 high school rankings, in 1982, '83, and 
'85. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Morgan State in Baltimore, he went to the NFL in 1968 and played 
for four teams as a defensive back, among them the Washington Redskins under 
Vince Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
At Dunbar, he was both father and coach to many young men who had had neither 
before joining Wade's high school basketball or football teams. By all 
accounts, Wade was successful, respected and clean. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Bias' death and the restructuring of the athletic 
department, it seemed that he was just what Maryland needed -- a strong hand to 
set the program straight. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, however, what Maryland might have needed more was an experienced 
college coach, not a disciplinarian. Outside the basketball arena, Wade was 
rough and gruff, quite the opposite of Driesell. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986-87 season was as difficult as expected for the first-year coach. The 
Terrapins struggled to a 9-17 finish, going winless in 14 ACC games. But the 
next season, 1987-88, Maryland went 18-13, 6-8 in the ACC and, surprisingly, 
qualified for the NCAA tournament. After beating UC Santa Barbara in the first 
round, 92-82, Wade stood before a large group of sportswriters, smugly enjoying 
a moment some had thought would never come to him. 
</P>
<P>
One of Wade's biggest coaching assests was his recruiting ability. Among his 
top recruits were 6-10 center Brian Williams, 6-10 forward Jerrod Mustaf, 6-8 
guard Walt Williams and 6-1 guard Rudy Archer. Each was touted as one of the 
nation's elite high school -- or in Archer's case, junior college -- recruits. 
But although Wade could get good players, he couldn't keep them. Williams was 
the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1988, Williams, the ACC's rookie of the year, said he had had enough 
of Wade, and in July of of that year announced that he would transfer to 
Arizona, where he is now a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Williams told The Washington Post in December: "I was fine (at Maryland) as far 
as the social life. I was fine there as far as the academics. But I said to 
myself, 'Where do I want to be in a few years, and what coach do I want to be 
playing under and in what kind of system?' I didn't think I could be there 
under Bob Wade." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most telling defection, though, had occurred earlier. On April 1, 
1988, Slaughter had announced that he was leaving Maryland for Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Bob when I left, 'The only thing I regret, is that I'm leaving you 
alone,' " Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
In February of 1989, a Washington Post reporter began uncovering information 
that Archer, the Terrapins' former point guard who had been dismissed because 
of academics, was getting transportation to a nearby junior college from 
members of Wade's coaching staff -- an NCAA rules violation. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the reporter began working on the story, Wade told Athletic 
Director Lew Perkins that his basketball staff had violated NCAA rules by 
providing transportation to a recruit. 
</P>
<P>
The university immediately reported the violation to the NCAA and the ACC and 
left the matter to its legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Wade denied prior knowledge of the transportation, and said emphatically that 
he had had no involvement in giving rides to Archer. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, freshman guard Jesse Martin was charged with assault 
and battery after an alleged altercation with a female student. Maryland 
basketball just couldn't stay out of the news, and both athletic department and 
school administrators seemed satisfied to blame Wade. 
</P>
<P>
But some players believed Wade was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the university betrayed him," said Jerrod Mustaf, who was recently 
drafted by the New York Knicks. "After Rudy (was academically dismissed), he 
would still come back and shoot around in the gym. Lots of people did. I didn't 
think much of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But the athletic director (Lew Perkins) was there. He saw Rudy, and if it was 
wrong, if it was against the rules, why didn't he say, 'Hey Bob, he's not 
allowed to be in here.'? I didn't know about that rule. And Coach Wade was 
still sort of new to college, maybe he wasn't aware of the rule. I don't know. 
But (Perkins) surely did. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning, Coach Wade and the athletic department didn't get along 
together and one of them had to leave. And the same thing is happening now, 
somebody's going to have to leave again," said Mustaf, just a month before 
Perkins resigned to become athletic director at Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
In his three years at Maryland, Wade's teams had a 36-50 record overall, went 
7-35 in the ACC and made one NCAA tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1989, Wade resigned under pressure brought about by a nearly 
three-month investigation of his program. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA infractions report last March accused Wade of a cover-up, questioning 
his knowledge about the illegal rides to Archer and said, "The head coach knew, 
or should have known that the men's basketball staff was providing such 
transportation." 
</P>
<P>
The report also said: "The coach participated in a meeting on Feb. 20, 1989, 
with other members of the men's basketball coaching staff for the purpose of 
providing false and misleading information regarding the transportation of a 
prospective student-athlete." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, Maryland's newest troubles were laid squarely on Wade. Although 
many of the facts surrounding his regime are still unclear, some think he was 
simply the most convenient scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GARY WILLIAMS 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Wade resigned, a six-member board offered the coaching job to Ohio 
State's Coach Gary Williams, a 1968 Maryland graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams accepted the offer on June 13, 1989, fully aware that the program was 
under investigation, and that he might have to pay for mistakes made during the 
Wade era. 
</P>
<P>
Williams seemed to be everything the Terrapins were looking for. A very intense 
person on court, he was squeaky-clean off it, everyone said. A three-year 
starter as a guard at Maryland, Williams had coached at American University and 
Boston College before moving on to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season at OSU, 1986-87, he led the Buckeyes to a 20-13 record, 9-9 
in the Big Ten and an appearance in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the Buckeyes went 20-13 again and lost to Connecticut in the final 
of the National Invitation Tournament. And in 1988-89, they went 19-15 and were 
ousted from the NIT in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Williams was 59-41 at Ohio State and was regarded as one of the 
nation's top young coaches. 
</P>
<P>
He was an instant hit at College Park. A handsome man with a warm smile, 
Williams has a distinctive, bouncing walk that was soon being widely imitated. 
In a sportscast on a Washington television station, Terrapin players took turns 
mocking Williams' walk, and sideline antics for the camera. After three tough 
years, Maryland basketball was fun again. 
</P>
<P>
Students lined up inside the gym at 6:30 a.m. on the day of a game for student 
tickets, armed with pillows and doughnuts and an occasional book or two for the 
long wait. 
</P>
<P>
Williams often met students during the early morning ticket handout. But if 
that wasn't possible, he was sure to greet them with high-fives and handshakes 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the excitement of the new job, however, Williams had seemingly forgotten 
about a few mistakes of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days after Williams was named as the Terrapins' new coach, the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer reported that he was being investigated by Ohio State officials 
for possible misuse of telephone privileges. He allegedly had made more that 
479 calls to the residence and office of Victoria Chen, who identified herself 
as Williams' investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
Williams divorced his wife of 20 years in November of 1989, then became engaged 
to Chen a few months later. In July of 1989, the Maryland State Ethics 
Commission began investigating a $90,000 second mortgage, arranged by and for 
Athletic Director Lew Perkins through the athletic department's fund raising 
arm, the Terrapin Club. When the loan was made public, Perkins pulled out of 
the deal and the investigation was dropped. But the uniting of Maryland and 
investigation had occurred again. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Maryland officials told the NCAA that Jeff Adkins, a former 
assistant basketball coach, had violated NCAA rules by arranging to sell ACC 
tournament tickets for five Terrapin players. 
</P>
<P>
The university told the NCAA that Adkins' scalping of ACC tickets wasn't an 
isolated incident, and Adkins told the university's investigators that it had 
been going on as a matter of course since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Later in February, Maryland told the NCAA and the ACC that Williams had 
observed an informal workout -- a pick-up game among Maryland players -- before 
the beginning of preseason practice. 
</P>
<P>
Here it was, happening again, even before the NCAA had finished its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Then in March, the NCAA announced its findings and sanctions in a live 
television conference shown on three of Washington's largest television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will cost the Terrapin athletic department an estimated $4 
million in lost revenues over two years. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Maryland announced a scholarship freeze for all 23 varsity sports and 
cut financing for several other men's and women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
On May 14, Gary Williams was arrested for drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Athletic Director Perkins announced he was leaving Maryland 
for Connecticut. His resignation sounded a familiar chord. When Dull and 
Driesell resigned after Bias' death, Wade and Perkins had been looked upon as 
saviors. Now, Williams and a yet-to-be-named athletic director have inherited a 
similar mess, and Williams has already had problems of his own. 
</P>
<P>
They may very well be wondering at Maryland if there is no end to all of this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LIST OF NCAA SANCTIONS AGAINST MARYLAND 
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1990, the NCAA and University of Maryland held a joint news 
conference in College Park, Md., to announce sanctions against the Terrapin 
basketball program. After the sanctions were read, Maryland President Dr. 
William Kirwan announced he would appeal the ruling, which was upheld last 
week. The sanctions: 
</P>
<P>
1. Banned from postseason play through the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
2. Placed on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
3. Prohibited from appearing on television for the 1990-91 season, which also 
bars the school from competing in the televised 1991 Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
4. Must return $361,000 to the NCAA from participation in its 1988 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
5. Scholarships reduced from 15 to 13 through the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
6. Foreign tours prohibited through the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
7. Games outside the continental U.S. prohibited through the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
8. Individual and team records from the 1988 NCAA tournament deleted and the 
team's finish in the final standings vacated. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Because of the sanctions, the athletic department has a projected budget 
deficit of $2.6 million for the upcoming academic year. In the long term, it is 
expected to cost $4 million.

Maryland -- A caption running with the University of Maryland story in

basketball coach, told his players to clean the dormitory room in which Len 
Bias had died of a cocaine overdose. A grand jury investigation in 1986 was 
unable to verify that accusation and neither Driesell nor any of his players or

FREE AGENT PERKINS GOES TO THE LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THE DEAL IS ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH $18 MILLION FOR SIX YEARS. 
CAVALIERS DENY TRADE RUMORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was that all there is? 
</P>
<P>
After a week of speculation that the Lakers were about to acquire every NBA big 
man who was available -- and several who weren't -- the team Monday signed 
free-agent Sam Perkins to a deal estimated to be worth $18 million for six 
years and called "one of the top three or four contracts" in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
So the speculation ends? 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
While Perkins was speaking at a Forum press conference, a Laker source said a 
deal sending A.C. Green and Byron Scott to Cleveland for 6-11 Hot Rod Williams 
and guard Craig Ehlo is on hold, but still on the table and even "likely." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cleveland officials vehemently denied any talks. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, you can't trade a free agent," Cavalier General Manager Wayne 
Embry told an Ohio writer. "That's the rule. Why don't people understand that? 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, we're not looking to move Ehlo. We really can't afford to trade him. 
That's all I'm going to say about this." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is thought to be imminent. Laker General Manager Jerry West is on 
vacation for two weeks, and his assistant, Mitch Kupchak, represented the team 
Monday. Key Laker aides have been told that there's nothing about to happen, 
and are planning to start their own vacations this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers may be hoping that Williams, a restricted free agent, holds out -- 
he has already lost his suit for unrestricted status -- and pressures the 
Cavaliers into a deal they don't seem to want. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the Lakers have a lot of depth at power forward, now shared by 
Green and Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, the star of this season's unrestricted free-agent class, got a 
contract, described by a source as "comparable" to the deal that Dallas offered 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins said the Lakers offered a little more than the Mavericks. His lawyer, 
Lee Fentress, said it was one of "the top three or four contracts" in 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Lakers, Kupchak called it "a very significant and happy day," 
but wasn't sure Perkins would start. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of himself, the soft-spoken Perkins noted that he had received two 
other offers even higher than the Mavericks' and Lakers'. He made his decision 
on other factors -- the Lakers' tradition and upbeat style, the chance to play 
with Magic Johnson and Perkins' North Carolina roommate, James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one for attention," Perkins said. "Before I start saying things that 
don't make sense up here, I'd like to say I'm very excited." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins now earns more than any Laker but Johnson. Is he worth it? 
</P>
<P>
"Is anybody worth this kind of money?" Perkins asked, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins is similarly unassuming on the floor. A Dallas writer calls him "a 
totally complementary player." However, if he isn't overpowering at any one 
thing, Perkins' game has no holes. He's 6-9 and his 41-inch sleeve size makes 
him a shot blocker. He has bulked up into the 240-pound range. He's a decent 
perimeter shooter, has a nice post-up game and has played all three positions 
on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a favorite of his coaches, from Dean Smith to Bobby Knight in the 
Olympics to Dick Motta, John MacLeod and Richie Adubato in Dallas, for doing 
the little things, playing hurt, practicing hard and not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
He has averaged 14 points and eight rebounds a game. Last season, with Roy 
Tarpley gone much of the time and Adubato featuring him, Perkins improved his 
shooting percentage to 49.3%, his best mark since 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
As things stand, the Lakers have traded Orlando Woolridge, are about to accept 
Michael Cooper's "retirement," have taken the $1.5 million-$2 million they've 
saved, thrown some more in from the newly raised salary cap and given it to 
Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
They have upgraded the forward rotation, Perkins replacing Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell if the vacationing West has more plans.

UCLA COMES UP WITH O'BANNON ON THE REBOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE and ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed O'Bannon, one of the country's most coveted basketball recruits last season 
at Artesia High School in Lakewood, announced Monday that he will enroll next 
month at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-8 forward, O'Bannon is the second recruit in the last week to spurn 
Nevada Las Vegas in favor of the Bruins, joining Shon Tarver, a 6-5 guard from 
Santa Clara High in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, the defending national champion, was banned by the NCAA from postseason 
competition next year because of alleged recruiting violations of 13 years ago, 
prompting O'Bannon and Tarver to change their minds about enrolling at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Neither O'Bannon nor Tarver signed letters of intent with UNLV at the 
suggestion of Coach Jerry Tarkanian, giving them the option of changing their 
minds if UNLV was penalized by the NCAA before the start of the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV is still awaiting word on possible sanctions stemming from alleged 
improprieties in its recruitment of former New York City prep star Lloyd 
Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon is expected to have the greater immediate impact on the UCLA program, 
possibly moving into the starting lineup as a freshman in place of Trevor 
Wilson, who was drafted last June by the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Frieder of Arizona State, who wanted both players, said last winter 
that the left-handed O'Bannon was the best player he has ever tried to recruit. 
</P>
<P>
Among Frieder's former recruits are Roy Tarpley of the Dallas Mavericks, Glen 
Rice of the Miami Heat and Gary Grant of the Clippers. Three of Frieder's 
former recruits at Michigan -- Rumeal Robinson, Loy Vaught and Terry Mills -- 
were first-round NBA draft picks this year. 
</P>
<P>
"O'Bannon will be a three-time All-American no matter where he goes," Tarkanian 
said last week, when O'Bannon was still considering USC, Syracuse and Arizona 
State. "If UCLA gets both (O'Bannon and Tarver), they could have the best team 
in the country. They'll be so talented, it will be unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach George Raveling of USC, which was said to be O'Bannon's second 
choice last spring and again this summer: "My feelings are the same as when he 
announced he was going to attend UNLV, except now it gives the Pac-10 two teams 
this year with Final Four potential." 
</P>
<P>
With the additions of Tarver and O'Bannon, UCLA is expected to challenge 
Arizona next season for the Pac-10 championship. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Bruins were 22-11 and reached the East Regional semifinals in 
the NCAA tournament before losing to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that I can contribute in some small way to the great UCLA basketball 
tradition," O'Bannon said in a statement read over the phone to reporters by 
his high school coach, Wayne Merino. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon and his family were unavailable for comment, referring all inquiries 
to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon averaged 24.6 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists a game last season, 
leading Artesia to a 29-2 record, the Southern Section 4-A championship and the 
state Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
He was named national high school player of the year by Basketball Times and 
state player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
In postseason all-star games, he was named most valuable player of the West 
team in the Dapper Dan Classic and scored 19 points in the McDonald's All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he helped the U.S. junior national team win the Championship of the 
Americas tournament at Montevideo, Uruguay, averaging 11.5 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
His roommate in Uruguay was Darrick Martin, UCLA's junior point guard and one 
of fourreturning starters for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"Darrick is a great spokesman for UCLA basketball and UCLA in general," said 
Bruin Coach Jim Harrick, giving credit to Martin for influencing O'Bannon's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel fortunate," Harrick said. "We got (Tarver and O'Bannon) after some 
bizarre things happened. Yeah, we feel very fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) obviously, they weren't completely satisfied with their (original) 
selections because they didn't sign letters of intent."

SUCCESS QUICK FOR STEVENS, BUT QUESTION IS STAYING POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The measure of progress for most rookies is how well they hit the curveball. 
For Lee Stevens, it's how often he throws his batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Only twice has the Angel first baseman given in to the rages that used to 
follow his unsuccessful at-bats in the minor leagues, signifying that either he 
has become more mature or more successful since he joined the Angels on July 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Or both. 
</P>
<P>
"At this level you just don't do it (throw your helmet) because it's a step 
up," Stevens said. "I don't know if the reason is because there's so many eyes 
on me or I'm just handling it better. I don't know that I get frustrated any 
more. I'm never satisfied. I never give up." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens has seemingly adapted to the mental and physical demands of playing 
every day in the major leagues. Promoted after first baseman Wally Joyner was 
found to have a fractured right kneecap, the 6-foot-4, 205-pound Stevens has 
earned a place on merit and not on contingency. 
</P>
<P>
"The success he's had warrants his being here," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. 
"The fact that he struggled for a short period of time is nothing unusual, with 
the scouting that goes on nowadays and cable (televised games). It's easy for 
opponents to catch on to a young player's vulnerabilities. A young player is 
going to have to make some adjustments, and so far he's made them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to go out there and produce again after you've gone through a 
tough stretch. You have to be emotionally sound and have to make some mental 
adjustments. I have no question that he's able to do those things." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, a first-round draft pick by the Angels in 1986, knew he wouldn't be 
able to maintain the pace he set in his first few games, when he was six for 17 
with a double, a home run and six runs batted in. But he also knew he could hit 
more than .200, the level he reached July 27 after going three for 28. 
</P>
<P>
Although he struck out three times Sunday, Stevens got a hit in his final 
at-bat and has at least one in six of his last seven games. He has gone 12 for 
28 during that stretch, raising his batting average to .286 entering the 
Angels' three-game series against the AL East-leading Boston Red Sox. His 11 
RBIs in 20 games makes him one of the Angels' most productive hitters. 
</P>
<P>
He produced one of those RBIs in his debut with a single, part of a 
three-for-four performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to believe, my first night getting three hits," Stevens said. "I 
didn't expect that kind of night at all. Not that it was easy, but I thought it 
would be tougher. I was thrown in the fire and didn't have time to think about 
it or worry, and maybe that helped me. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I started trying to do a little too much, I think. I changed my 
mechanics from the way I had been doing things when I first got here. Now I 
think I'm back to where I was. I wasn't trying to hit home runs, just changing 
to adapt to what I thought I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
He has since discovered that all he has to do is what he did before. "The 
game's pretty much the same," said Stevens, who was hitting .293 with 16 home 
runs and 66 RBIs when he was recalled from Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"The players are a little more consistent, and guys put the ball in play more. 
The pitchers come at you more, too. The Oakland staff impressed me. That's why 
they lead the league in ERA. To me, every pitcher is a challenge. There's no 
easy pitcher or they wouldn't be in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
How long he will remain in the major leagues is a question Stevens prefers not 
to ponder. He's guaranteed an extended stay because Joyner's knee has been slow 
to heal, but just in case, Stevens hasn't made permanent living arrangements in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm renting," he said. "I try not to worry about it. It's not 
necessarily that I'm trying to take his job -- I'm trying to open peoples' eyes 
and trying to make a name for myself. I don't want to make it an issue of 
trying to take Wally's job. I'm just doing my job. 
</P>
<P>
"They take very good care of you here. You can get spoiled. A lot of players 
I'd talked to before I came up here who had been in the big leagues said 
there's no place like the big leagues, and they're right. Until you get there 
and be sure you're going to stay there, you can't be content. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to drive in runs and produce. One of my goals is to be more focused 
and concentrate more in every at-bat so I can do that job better. I'm never 
content. I feel I have a lot of potential left. I've done a little more than I 
expected, which is hard for me to do because I expect a lot from myself. The 
coaches know I've never been satisfied with my stats. I'm out there to work as 
hard as I can, whether the team's in first place or wherever." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said he put "some guys . . . but I wouldn't say the 
whole club" on waivers Aug. 1 at the start of the new waiver period. The Angels 
can withdraw any player claimed by another club. Players who clear waivers can 
be traded before the Aug. 31 deadline for eligibility for postseason play. 
Waiver claims are kept confidential and Port would not say if any Angels were 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Port also said his declaration on July 17 that Angel player must "flat-out 
start showing results" or face the possibility of being traded was not a 
threat. Although he said the Angels were ready to do business with other clubs, 
he has made no deals. After defeating Milwaukee the night of his remarks, the 
Angels were 45-46 and 12 games out of first place; they are 7-11 since and have 
fallen 16 games behind Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an observation and wasn't meant in a motivational vein," Port said of 
his remarks, which were made in separate conversations with reporters. "I 
wasn't questioning anybody's effort. It was more in the category of an 
observation than a clubhouse motivational speech." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Bert Blyleven is expected to return today after being with his family 
since last Thursday, after his wife, daughter and two of his three sons were 
injured in a car accident. He's not scheduled to pitch in the Angels' series 
against Boston.

DYE DESIGN FIRM SEEKS PURCHASE OF CYPRESS CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golf course designer Pete Dye is attempting to purchase Cypress Country Club, 
formerly Los Alamitos Golf Course, and turn it into a championship golf resort 
that would be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Dye Designs of Denver, Colo., has entered escrow to purchase the 96-acre course 
and an additional 21 acres from the owners of Los Alamitos Race Track, adjacent 
to the course. Sources said the purchase price is about $33 million. A 
spokesman for Dye Designs said he hopes escrow will close at the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game plan at this point, while preliminary, would be to remodel the golf 
course into a championship style course, make it into a great golf course, and 
attach a hotel to it," said Charles Tourtellotte, president of Dye Equity. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-hole, par-66 course was closed several years ago by Hollywood Park 
Realty. In September of 1989, a group headed by Lloyd Arnold purchased the Los 
Alamitos Race Track, the golf course and adjacent land from Hollywood Park 
Realty for $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Arnold has spent about $2 million in renovations. But should Dye 
Designs purchase it, the entire course will be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't use any of the existing (facilities)," Tourtellotte said. "It will 
totally be redone." Tourtellotte estimates that $5 million will be spent to 
rebuild the course, exclusive of the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the third golf course in California owned by Dye Designs, which is 
in the process of building Fresno Ball Ranch and the Old Coach in Poway. But 
Dye, who has designed numerous courses around the world, is perhaps best known 
for the PGA West Stadium Course at La Quinta -- a difficult course dotted with 
pot bunkers, boulders, railroad ties, rolling terrain and lakes. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 acres adjacent to the course would be used for a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's zoned for hotel and office," Tourtellotte said. "We're going to try and 
get a hotel up there as quickly as we can. We're talking to some operators 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Golf Course and the use of the adjacent land long has been the 
subject of controversy in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Cypress voters approved an initiative allowing Arnold to convert 75 
acres of land surrounding the track into a business complex. Arnold promised 
voters that the course, which also provides a greenbelt for some Cypress 
residents, would stay open for at least 10 years.

DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
CEE'S TIZZY PUTS TRAINER INTO TIZZY WITH A NEAR-RECORD PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though the track at Del Mar has been unusually fast lately, Cee's Tizzy's 
winning time of 1:07 4/5 Monday is worth noting. It was only one-fifth of a 
second off the track record, set by King of Cricket in August of 1973, and it 
was the 3-year-old colt's second impressive performance in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice horse," said John Russell, Cee's Tizzy's trainer. "This is a horse 
I've been counting on." 
</P>
<P>
Last month at Hollywood Park, Cee's Tizzy, the grandson of 5-year old champion 
Tizly, broke his maiden in 1:08 3/5 for six furlongs. But in his Del Mar debut 
-- the second division of the mile-long July 25 Oceanside Stakes -- Cee's 
Tizzy, owned by Cecillia Staub-Rubens and ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, fell 
off the pace early and finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"He was too green a horse to ride in that long of a race," Russell said. "That 
was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Russell said Delahoussaye rode the perfect race Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie is a very patient rider and he almost got us the track record," Russell 
said. "The track is very hard and fast right now. I sort of owed Eddie one for 
a long time. He's been a great friend and a great rider for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Russell said Cee's Tizzy is a potential Breeders' Cup horse, but said he is not 
sure when he will run him again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be very careful with him," Russell said. "We'll probably go 
seven-eighths of a mile next and then maybe a mile if he's ready." 
</P>
<P>
The first scuffle of the meeting between jockeys occurred Monday when Alex 
Solis threw a couple punches at Kent Desormeaux after the fourth race. In that 
race, Solis thought that Desormeaux's horse, Fareway Foli, left his horse, 
Chief Sassafras, too little running room. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmish was quickly broken up, although both jockeys will be called in 
Wednesday to talk with the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
With the radio sports talk-show market booming, John Hernandez figured, "Why 
shouldn't there be a talk show strictly for horse racing fans?" 
</P>
<P>
So Hernandez, a horse owner and a former racing publicist, began a nightly talk 
show for Southern California racing fans called "Thoroughbred Nightly." 
</P>
<P>
"You can make the argument that there isn't an audience to support a nightly 
show, but the statistics don't show that," said Hernandez, whose show has been 
on the air for almost a year. "The mainstream talk shows do not do a very good 
job of covering horse racing, unless it's (Kentucky) Derby season or Breeders' 
Cup season." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics Hernandez is referring to are a daily racing audience in 
Southern California of 30,000, which includes satellite and track attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"Thoroughbred Nightly" can be heard on K-Orange, AM 1190, in Anaheim from 8 to 
9 p.m. During the Del Mar meeting, Hernandez's show can also be heard on KCEO, 
AM 1000, a 1,500-watt station in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The hour show consists of about 30 minutes of phone calls from what Hernandez 
says is a loyal audience. There also are interviews with jockeys, trainers, 
owners and handicappers and nightly handicapping tips from Bruno De Julio, the 
show's co-host. 
</P>
<P>
But Hernandez stressed that his show is not a tout show. "We're not asking 
people to call a 900 line for advice," he said. "We're just giving good solid 
information for educated people." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally, fresh from his first stakes victory of the Del Mar 
meeting, left Monday for Saratoga, where he will be inducted into racing's Hall 
of Fame Thursday. McAnally's horse, Tight Spot, held off Itsallgreektome by a 
nose in winning the $107,000 La Jolla Handicap Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens, who already has nine winning mounts at Del Mar, will also 
travel to Saratoga this week. He will ride Wayne Lukas' Open Mind in the 
Ballerina Stakes Friday. Then on Saturday, Stevens will be at Monmouth, N.J., 
to ride Deposit Ticket, another Lukas horse, in the Sapling Stakes.

<P>
"This was not a typical Cooperstown day," Mayor Harold Hollis said. "We did the 
best we could." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, Morgan, Holtzman and Saam were inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame 
Monday, a day after the ceremony was postponed because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
It rained again Monday and, in a departure from the norm, the four made their 
induction speeches from the stage of the Cooperstown high school auditorium, 
with Ted Williams, Bob Feller, Stan Musial and Willie Stargell sitting with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Seating in the auditorium was limited to invited guests and media members. Just 
in case someone didn't know where to go, the superintendent of schools was on 
hand to direct traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Another group watched on a big-screen TV wheeled into the carpeted cafeteria. 
The lunch tables were moved out of the way and seats were borrowed from 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fans, however, stood outside in the rain and listened to the 
ceremonies on loudspeakers that are usually used to announce the end of recess. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Hall of Fame exhibition game, scheduled between Baltimore and 
Montreal, was cancelled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry a lot of people who came to share this moment with me didn't see 
it," Palmer said. "This is a celebration of what the game is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer pitched to a career record of 268-152 and a 2.86 earned run average with 
the Baltimore Orioles and played on World Series champions in 1966, '70 and 
'83. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan won consecutive MVP awards in 1975 and '76, helping the Cincinnati Reds 
to the World Series championship each year. He had a lifetime average of .271 
with 268 homers and 1,133 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Palmer were each elected to the Hall of Fame in their first year of 
eligibility after careers noted for winning numbers on winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
Holtzman, a baseball writer in Chicago for 29 years, was the recipient of the 
J.G. Taylor Spink award; and Saam, longtime voice of the Philadelphia Phillies, 
was inducted into the broadcasters wing.

NEWSWIRE: NHL-SOVIET SERIES MAY BE CANCELED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
National Hockey League officials have given the Soviet Union two days to 
confirm its participation in two exhibition series or both may be canceled, 
Montreal Canadiens' general manager Serge Savard said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Korolev, vice president of the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation, and Igor 
Dmitriev, assistant coach of the national team, said at the Goodwill Games in 
Seattle they will notify the league Wednesday that the two series will be 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation would be a protest against the Detroit Red Wings' signing of 
Sergei Fedorov, one of the top 20-year-old players in the world, who left the 
national team before the Goodwill Games and signed with Detroit.

Iraqi soldiers rounded up hundreds of foreigners in Kuwait on Monday and began 
transporting them to Iraq, while persistent reports of a threatening Iraqi 
troop presence at the Saudi Arabian border escalated military tensions in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration said that 28 Americans were among an 
estimated 366 foreigners taken from two hotels in the Kuwaiti capital and 
placed on buses for Baghdad, where analysts said they could be held to 
discourage an American air strike. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of the detainees -- including Britons, West Germans and a 
Spaniard in addition to the Americans -- appeared to have been passengers on a 
British Airways flight that was stranded at Kuwait Airport after last 
Thursday's invasion, according to the British Foreign Office in London. 
</P>
<P>
British officials expressed hope that the travelers would be permitted to leave 
Iraq after their arrival in Baghdad and said that none of the detainees 
appeared to be in danger. At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler said it was too early to consider the travelers as hostages, but she 
stressed that American officials "hold Iraq responsible for their safety." 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, the Security Council, in its strongest such action in 23 
years, adopted a comprehensive package of trade and military sanctions against 
Iraq, including a ban on oil and other exports from Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq, 
which is believed to have launched the invasion of Kuwait in a bid to increase 
its oil revenues, earns $11 billion a year from petroleum sales, representing 
nearly all its foreign-currency earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney conferred with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd in Riyadh 
about possible military options should Iraqi troops cross the Kuwaiti-Saudi 
frontier. Diplomatic sources said that Saudi Arabia has deployed at least one 
armored brigade from a military base about 50 miles south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Iraq announced that it has halted the flow of export oil through 
one side of twin Iraqi pipelines that pass through Turkey to the Mediterranean 
Sea and had reduced the flow through the other side by more than half because 
of decreased demand. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will make an emergency trip to Turkey 
this week to discuss the pipeline issue with the Ankara government, and 
diplomatic sources in the region said a key purpose of Cheney's visit to Saudi 
Arabia is to reassure Saudi officials of American military protection. U.S. 
officials said that it was not certain whether Cheney would travel on to other 
Middle East capitals before returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraqi officials notified the capital city's 4 million residents to 
be prepared to evacuate, and an Iraqi journalist interviewed by telephone from 
Amman, Jordan, said "precautions are under way" throughout the Iraqi capital 
for any U.S. air strike. 
</P>
<P>
However, several sources said the United States is likely to think carefully 
before any attack on Iraq because of the 500 Americans who live there. 
Recalling the 1986 bombing raid on Tripoli, Libya, one official explained: "We 
have people in Baghdad, whereas we did not have people in Tripoli." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that Iraq appears to be increasing its presence near 
the Saudi border, and White House spokesman Marvin Fitzwater declared that it 
is "clearly in the national interest to stop Saddam Hussein," the Iraqi 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the (Persian) Gulf remains extremely serious," Fitzwater 
said. "There is no information suggesting that Iraqi military units are 
departing Kuwait. To the contrary, the Iraqi military presence throughout 
Kuwait, including along the Saudi border, remains extremely large and 
threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the gulf said there were no signs of an imminent 
confrontation along the Saudi border, but they added that Saudi troops appeared 
to be deploying away from bases in the region in order to be dispersed from 
central military locations in the event of an Iraqi strike. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to be in the field -- just like a boat wants to be at sea rather 
than in port in the event of an attack," one official in Saudi Arabia said. 
"When you're in a base, you're all sitting together, and you're in fact 
inviting a preventive attack." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Airways evacuated 300 Iraqis from Cairo to Amman on Monday on two 
unscheduled Boeing 747 flights, according to an Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
official. Egyptian officials said they believed the move was a response to 
rapidly deteriorating relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ambassador here told Egyptian officials that Iraq was simply taking 
vacationing tourists home. But a Foreign Ministry source said that Egypt fears 
Iraq may be planning to take action against the 1.5 million Egyptians working 
in Iraq and does not want to leave room for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's treating our people there as prisoners, and he's afraid we will do the 
same thing with his people," this official said. "It's a war step." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Iraqi Embassy in Cairo confirmed the flights but said he 
could not say why his countrymen were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
As the economic chokehold on Iraq tightened Monday, oil analysts said Baghdad's 
decision to cut back exports through its trans-Turkey pipelines reflected in 
large part dwindling markets for Iraqi petroleum in the face of a spreading 
embargo movement and could be expected to cut Iraq's total crude oil exports in 
half. These exports, through all channels, recently had been running at about 
2.7 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
After the Security Council vote Monday, President Bush called for "full and 
total" implementation of the global sanctions. "These sanctions will be 
enforced, whatever it takes," Bush said at a Washington news conference with 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the squeeze on petroleum in the Persian Gulf, world oil prices 
jumped another $3 a barrel Monday to their highest level in more than four 
years. Analysts predicted the reduction in flows through the Turkish pipelines 
could translate into a shortfall in the world market of at least 4 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials also have been 
stepping up pressure against Turkey and Saudi Arabia to shut down the pipelines 
across their territories through which Iraq exports 90% of its crude. Both 
countries have expressed private nervousness over an increasingly belligerent 
Hussein, who has threatened swift retaliation against any nation that threatens 
Iraq's security. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Hussein summoned American charge d'affaires Joseph Wilson and 
emphasized that Iraq has no plans to invade Saudi Arabia, but he warned the 
United States "against any behavior that destabilizes the region," according to 
the Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq (is) capable of defending its sovereignty, interests and rights and 
expresses its readiness for sacrifice," the agency quoted Hussein as saying. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler said that Wilson, in a meeting that 
lasted several hours, raised the issue of the 3,000 Americans in Kuwait and the 
500 living in Iraq, in addition to demanding that Iraq withdraw its troops from 
Kuwait and restore the ousted government of that tiny emirate. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned Iraqi 
Ambassador Mohammed al Mashat to try to establish the whereabouts of the 28 
Americans who were among the foreigners rounded up for transport to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials and several military analysts said it appears Hussein is 
attempting to bring foreign nationals into Baghdad and may well transfer them 
to outlying military installations to discourage an American air strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a hostage situation," declared Heino Kopietz, a London-based Middle East 
specialist. "They stop being hostages when they're out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Kopietz added that Hussein "doesn't have to threaten them. The fact that 
they're in his hands, and given the record he has, you don't have to be very 
bright to figure out what he could do to them." 
</P>
<P>
Reports have been sketchy in the past several days from Kuwait. Its borders and 
airport have remained closed and its international telephone lines have been 
cut off since Iraqi troops stormed through the country early last Thursday and 
installed a proxy government. 
</P>
<P>
But a Swedish engineer who was among a growing number of Kuwaiti residents 
fleeing by car into Saudi Arabia said that he, like others, became concerned 
for the safety of his family with the Iraqi troops' spread throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, Mikael Wiberj, said he saw no Iraqi soldiers except those manning 
three checkpoints along the coastal road as he drove toward the border Sunday 
with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call our departure an adventure," Wiberj said in a telephone 
interview from his hotel in Bahrain. "Just a peaceful drive out of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Wiberj, an employee of Bofors Electronics Co., said two young women, an 
American and a Canadian, were turned back at the Saudi border crossing, which 
he said was manned only by Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the women) seemed very, very nervous," he said. Wiberj said he did not 
know their names or why they were denied entry into Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, Helena, Wiberj had lived for 18 months in a suburb south of the 
Kuwaiti capital and did not see any fighting. However, he said, he heard the 
bombing of the airport and became concerned for his family's safety. 
</P>
<P>
When a group of Iraqi officers, which he estimated at nearly 100, took quarters 
at a hotel near his home, he became more alarmed. "They began to ask the local 
people for food," he said, and he feared that it was a sign that discipline was 
breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was worth a try," he said of his decision to leave.

ANC HALTS ALL ARMED STRUGGLE; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: THE REBEL GROUP ACTS TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR TALKS ON POWER-SHARING 
BETWEEN THE BLACK MAJORITY AND THE WHITE MINORITY.

PRETORIA, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The African National Congress early today suspended its 30-year-old armed 
struggle against the white minority-led government of South Africa in an 
agreement that both sides described as "a milestone on the road to true peace 
and prosperity in our country." 
</P>
<P>
The historic declaration by the government and the country's primary guerrilla 
movement, coming at the end of a 14-hour meeting in Pretoria, cleared the ANC's 
remaining obstacles to formal negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The way is now open to proceed towards negotiations on a new constitution," 
the two sides said in a joint statement. They added that "exploratory talks" on 
ways of launching those negotiations will be held soon. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC-government accord set in motion a plan for the phased release of 
political prisoners and indemnity for returning exiles. Under that plan, the 
first prisoner releases will begin on Sept. 1 and indemnity declarations will 
begin on Oct. 1. The entire process will be completed by April 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to give "immediate consideration" to repealing all 
provisions of the Internal Security Act that make it a crime to further the 
aims of a Communist organization as well as those provisions that create a 
category of "listed" people and prohibit the publication of their statements or 
writings. 
</P>
<P>
It also said it will continue reviewing legislation "to ensure free political 
activity" and will introduce amendments to security legislation at the next 
session of Parliament in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, revealed early this morning at a joint news conference by 
President Frederik W. de Klerk and ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, brought 
to an end a guerrilla war, launched in 1960 by Mandela, that has claimed 
hundreds of lives, injured thousands and caused millions of dollars in property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no infiltrations of men and arms into South Africa, and any 
activity related to military action will be suspended," Mandela said. "And we 
hope to be able to communicate with our people and inform them of what we've 
decided." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela called the ANC's move "a significant concession." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a working group of ANC and government representatives will 
be established to deal with any disagreements over the guerrilla war 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's armed struggle has been mostly dormant in recent months, but the 
government has maintained that the ANC's continuing commitment to its military 
strategy has caused an increase in violence in South Africa's black townships. 
</P>
<P>
The two five-man teams from the ANC and the government expressed "serious 
concern about the general level of violence, intimidation and unrest in the 
country, especially in Natal (province)," their joint statement said. And both 
sides agreed to take steps to stabilize the situation "in line with the spirit 
of mutual trust . . . among the leaders involved." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most violent regions is Natal, in eastern South Africa, where 
supporters of the ANC have been battling followers of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi. Three years of factional fighting there have claimed some 
3,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
The government agreed today to consider lifting the state of emergency in Natal 
province "as early as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel there will hopefully be a fundamental change in the situation on the 
ground" as a result of the agreement, De Klerk said. Although the ANC says the 
fighting in Natal is not being directed by its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe 
(Spear of the Nation), some analysts believe the ANC's previous refusal to 
suspend the armed struggle has fueled the fighting, especially among young 
radicals in the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
"We think what has happened today forms an important turning point, which will 
in all probability result in a much more peaceful situation in South Africa," 
De Klerk said. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and the government disagreed strongly, however, on the activities of 
the South African police in quelling anti-apartheid protest in the country. 
More than 125 activists have been killed in police action, much of it aimed at 
halting protest marches, since the ANC and other organizations were unbanned in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the "police should at all times deal with violence in an 
evenhanded manner," and he added that the government would investigate ANC 
allegations of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the reply of the state president," Mandela countered 
at the news conference. "The actions of the police indicate to us that the 
government has not succeeded in curtailing police action. We feel quite 
dissatisfied with the way the state is dealing with peaceful protest. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something wrong. The government has either lost control over the 
police or the police are doing what the government wants," Mandela said. He 
added, however, that "the ANC accepts the government's assurances" that it will 
investigate instances of police misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those police clashes with demonstrators have followed ANC-organized 
protests. Mandela said the ANC is not abandoning its strategy of mass protest 
actions, which have included consumer boycotts and marches. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the new accord provides channels of communication between the ANC 
and the government "that can be used to defuse any situation that calls for 
mass action." 
</P>
<P>
Although they hailed their agreement as the first real step toward peace in 
South Africa, the government-ANC statement alluded to the fact that other 
parties, including Buthelezi's Inkatha movement, left-wing black organizations 
and right-wing whites, must now become involved in the process to keep it 
moving ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not pretend to be the only parties involved in the process of shaping 
the new South Africa," their statement said. "All of us can henceforth walk 
that road in consultation and cooperation with each other. We call upon all 
those who have not yet committed themselves to peaceful negotiations to do so 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The most important ANC precondition for constitutional negotiations was the 
freedom of political prisoners and the return of exiles without fear of 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations estimate that there are 2,500 to 3,000 people in 
South African prisons on convictions for politically motivated crimes, and more 
than 1,600 people currently are on trial for political offenses. The government 
has estimated that there are fewer than 400 political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Among the estimated 35,000 political exiles living outside South Africa, at 
least 6,000 are soldiers in the ANC's military wing, and several thousand 
others are involved in activities that might subject them to prosecution upon 
their return. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC-government agreement acknowledges De Klerk's power to pardon prisoners 
and grant indemnity to those activists, including exiles, who may be liable to 
prosecution or are now undergoing trial. But both sides agree that De Klerk 
will appoint a panel, by Aug. 31, to identify "political" prisoners on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
The accord establishes broad guidelines for that panel's decision-making, 
suggesting, for example, that the definition of a political crime could range 
from purely political offenses such as treason to common crimes, including 
murder. In the case of common crimes, the ANC-government agreement urges the 
panel to consider several circumstances, including the motive of the offender, 
the context in which the offense was committed and the nature of the political 
objective.

The African National Congress has undergone radical changes since it was 
launched in 1912 as the South African Native National Congress, a small group 
led by traditional chiefs. It was primarily a pressure group promoting the 
interests of black Africans by using legal means, such as petitions to the 
government. It began to resemble a mass liberation movement in the 1940s, when 
it adopted a constitution calling for universal suffrage. A Youth League was 
formed in 1943, attracting more radical blacks such as Nelson Mandela and 
Walter Sisulu, and the young radicals took control of the ANC in 1949. The 
shooting of unarmed demonstrators by police at Sharpeville in 1960 and the 
outlawing of the ANC the following year forced the organization to review its 
nonviolent strategy.

U.N. RETALIATES WITH EMBARGO ON OIL, ARMS; 
</P>
<P>
SANCTIONS: SECURITY COUNCIL'S STUNNING UNANIMITY IN STRIKING BACK AT IRAQ IS 
SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR BUSH.

<P>
Acting with swift and resounding unanimity, the United Nations Security Council 
on Monday imposed a worldwide economic and military embargo on Iraq for 
invading Kuwait and setting up a puppet regime to run its oil-rich neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved 13 to 0 with 2 abstentions, requires all 159 member 
nations of the global organization to stop importing oil from Iraq and Kuwait 
and to halt nearly all exports to the Baghdad regime, including arms. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third time in U.N. history that such sweeping sanctions were 
imposed, following earlier embargoes voted against the white-minority 
governments of Rhodesia and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The vote represented a major triumph for President Bush's campaign to place 
broad-based economic pressure on Saddam Hussein to force him to withdraw his 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Experts on the oil trade cautioned that Iraq still might be able to sell oil on 
the black market or to oil-dependent countries that choose to defy the 
sanctions in order to keep their economies strong. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions are expected to significantly complicate and constrict 
Iraq's chief method of producing income and to ostracize the nation in 
international commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"These sanctions must be enforced," Bush said at the White House after the 
vote. "We need to discuss full and total implementation of these sanctions, 
ruling out nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in Washington to discuss the Persian 
Gulf crisis, added: "I cannot remember a time when we had the world so strongly 
together against an action as now." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's envoy to the United Nations termed the embargo "illegal" and the product 
of U.S. intimidation. "One superpower is trying to use the U.N. and the 
Security Council to realize its objectives, as if the Security Council was 
simply its foreign ministry," Ambassador Abdul al Anbari said. 
</P>
<P>
However, only two Security Council members did not vote for the resolution: 
Cuba and Yemen both abstained. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, once Iraq's main arms supplier and often at odds with the 
United States in U.N. affairs, voted for the sanctions. So did China, another 
permanent Security Council member along with the United States, Britain and 
France. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has indicated that a naval blockade to stop tanker 
shipments from Iraq and Kuwait is being considered to back up the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts warned that it may be difficult to stop all sales of Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti oil because those nations produce 4 million barrels a day, or about 
7.5% of world output. Higher prices will provide a strong temptation to cheat. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with oil, and you're dealing with money -- and the impact of 
that on a lot of countries is going to be very serious," said Patrick Connelly, 
a specialist on the oil trade at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the Middle East Economic Survey said it is doubtful that 
Saudi Arabia would increase its oil production to make up the shortfall. 
Increased Saudi production would be necessary to prevent oil-consuming nations 
from suffering significant adverse economic effects, but the Saudi government 
may be fearful of antagonizing Iraq, which has massed troops on its border. 
</P>
<P>
But G. Henry Schuler, director of the energy program for the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the embargo could pinch 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"If Western Europe, the United States and Japan comply in good faith, there is 
very little Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil that's going to move," he said. But "the 
boycotting nations . . . are going to feel the pain long before the Iraqis feel 
the pain." 
</P>
<P>
In an important gesture of support, Turkish President Turgut Ozal said in a 
broadcast interview that as a result of the vote, he will close the pipeline 
across his country that takes Iraqi oil to the Mediterranean for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We will obey the U.N. embargo," Ozal said. Earlier in the day, Iraq had 
announced that it would halt the flow of export oil through one side of 
pipeline that passes through Turkey to the Mediterranean and that it had 
reduced the flow through the other side by more than half because of decreased 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Another pipeline for Iraqi oil crosses Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution was the result of three days of 
behind-the-scenes lobbying by the United States. It came after the United 
States, Japan and the European Community had announced their own trade 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq must learn that its disregard for international law will have crippling 
political and economic costs, including but not limited to arms cutoffs," said 
Thomas R. Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. "Iraq's aggression 
must be and will be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Other favorable votes were cast by Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, 
Finland, Malaysia, Zaire and Romania, all temporary members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on U.N. members to prevent their citizens from aiding in 
the transshipment of Iraqi or Kuwaiti products -- language obviously directed 
at the Turkish and Saudi Arabian pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
It also calls on all states to cut off loans or any other form of economic aid 
to Iraq but allows the shipment of medical supplies and other humanitarian 
assistance. The U.N. action came as the stock market tumbled and oil prices 
climbed over fears that Iraq might send its troops into Saudi Arabia and 
tighten its grip on the world oil market even further. It followed an earlier 
resolution, passed 14 to 0 last Thursday, condemning the invasion and demanding 
immediate withdrawal from Kuwait of an estimated 100,000-man Iraqi invasion 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Anbari charged that the sanctions will "destroy the world economy. It's 
going to destroy Third World countries. The United States and U.S. oil 
companies will make billions of dollars, but the poor Third World countries 
will suffer the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
But Pickering said it was Iraq's "blatant aggression" that had plunged the gulf 
region into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Iraq's and Kuwait's huge reserves, he said, "Thirty percent of the 
world's oil is now under Iraqi control . . . thus threatening international 
economic health and stability." 
</P>
<P>
Compliance with the sanctions will hurt some nations more than others. Japan, 
for example, now imports 550,000 barrels a day from Iraq and Kuwait, or 12% of 
its consumption, and would have to make up for the loss elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which declared its support for the embargo, imports 30% of its oil from 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey gains about $500 million a year from its pipeline operations for Iraqi 
oil and gets half of its oil supply from Iraq at a favorable price. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand to suffer a great deal," said Turkish Ambassador Mustafa Aksin in a 
telephone interview. "We are not a rich country, and we don't have the room for 
maneuver that a country like Japan has, for example. But I think Turkey will do 
what is right." 
</P>
<P>
Latest U.S. government statistics show that West Germany, France, Britain and 
Japan all imported large amounts of oil from Iraq in 1988, indicating that they 
will need to replace part or all of this amount from other sources and probably 
pay a higher price for petroleum as long as the embargo lasts. Western Europe, 
Japan and the United States have accounted for 70% of Iraq's oil sales in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia could make up almost half of the 4-million-barrel daily shortfall 
with its surplus capacity if it chooses to do so, according to the Middle East 
Economic Review. The United Arab Emirates could supply another 600,000 barrels 
a day, and Venezuela has a 500,000-barrel-a-day spare capacity, the publication 
said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports of Iraqi crude oil amounted to 10% of total U.S. purchases of 
foreign oil in the first five months of this year. Kuwaiti oil represented a 2% 
share.

PROSECUTORS SAY CARPENTER WANTED DONATIONS BEFORE DISCUSSING BILLS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors, outlining their case against state Board of Equalization 
member Paul Carpenter, charged Monday that the former senator was a ruthless 
fund-raiser who sometimes refused to talk about legislation with lobbyists 
unless they steered money to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
According to the trial memorandum filed by the office of U.S. Atty. David F. 
Levi, secretly recorded conversations and other evidence demonstrate that 
Carpenter and his onetime aide, John Shahabian, had a callous view of the 
legislative process and blatantly used their positions of power to raise money 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about this system is it's foolproof," Shahabian advised a federal 
undercover agent in one tape-recorded conversation. " . . . You have to buy it 
. . . you have to buy in or you can't beat it . . . they've got all the angles 
covered. There's always another tollgate . . . even if you beat them at one 
point. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter is scheduled to go on trial Monday on four felony counts of 
extortion, racketeering and conspiracy dating from his days as a Democratic 
state senator from Norwalk. Carpenter has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian is expected to be a key witness for the prosecution. The former 
Carpenter aide began cooperating with the FBI after agents confronted him with 
the evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Carpenter trial is the second case against an elected state official 
stemming from the undercover FBI sting investigation of corruption in the state 
Capitol. The first trial resulted in the conviction in February of former Sen. 
Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who is serving a 6 1/2-year sentence at the 
federal prison camp near Boron. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when Carpenter was running for the Board of Equalization, the senator 
received a total of $20,000 from undercover agent John E. Brennan II. The agent 
posed as businessman Jack Gordon, a talkative Southerner seeking support for a 
bill that would help him set up a shrimp importing business near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Shahabian warned Brennan that he would get little action from the 
Legislature without making at least a $10,000 "first installment" to Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Shahabian extolled the virtues of his boss, saying, "He's an honest 
shooter. . . . And he's the best lobbyist you could have. . . . You can pay 
another lobbyist a hundred thousand and they couldn't do for you what he 
(Carpenter) can do for 10 (thousand dollars)." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Hinckley, Carpenter's attorney, has consistently predicted that 
Carpenter will be found innocent and has charged that the case is built largely 
around Shahabian's self-serving statements. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with prosecutors last November, Carpenter said he had suspected 
that the legislation sought by Brennan was part of an FBI undercover 
investigation. But he said he believed he was doing a "sort of reverse sting" 
on the FBI by accepting the $20,000 and then not voting for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Carpenter stated that he was giving the sponsor of the bill 'access' or 'an 
ear' at a particularly busy time in the legislative schedule in exchange for 
the contribution," the trial memorandum said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Carpenter is guilty of extorting a payment simply by 
accepting the money in exchange for a promise to help. 
</P>
<P>
In five separate incidents unrelated to the sting, prosecutors also charge that 
Carpenter used his Senate office illegally to solicit campaign contributions 
from lobbyists and other individuals who came to him seeking his vote. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the trial memorandum says, Carpenter made it clear he expected 
donations before he would discuss the legislation in question. In most of the 
conversations, he relied on computerized records to point out that he had not 
received the contributions he expected, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter received a contribution in only one of the five cases -- a $1,000 
donation from the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter told prosecutors that he could not remember most of the meetings, 
which date back as far as 1980. But in the case of the prison guards' 
organization, Carpenter said he recalled meeting with a lobbyist for the group. 
</P>
<P>
"Carpenter admitted that he had a list of his opponent's campaign contributions 
and pounded the table with this list," the trial memorandum said.

The Food and Drug Administration said it has approved a drug that company 
studies have shown can cut by 50% the death rate in premature infants suffering 
from a severe lung disease. The disease, called respiratory distress syndrome, 
is the most common cause of death in infants younger than 30 days, the American 
Lung Assn. said in New York. The drug, Exosurf, mimics the action of lung 
surfactant, a liquid that helps keep lungs inflated.

About 5,000 people who were forced to flee a fast-moving forest fire near here 
began returning to their homes Monday as the danger subsided, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Awbrey Mountain fire, six miles southwest of Bend, a town of about 17,000 
people, destroyed 28 homes, and burned across 3,300 acres of forest, grass and 
brush, said Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Jim Unterwegner. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was contained but still smoldered about a mile from the homes, 
Unterwegner said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,600 firefighters were expected to surround the fire with a 
containment line by tonight, he said. At least five other fires are burning in 
central and southern Oregon. The largest of them, the 1,300-acre Newberry 
Crater fire about 90 miles south of Bend, forced dozens of vacationers to flee 
area parks and resorts.

LAWYERS URGE REPEAL OF ABA'S ABORTION STAND; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: VOTE CALLS ON GOVERNING BODY TO REJECT ITS BACKING OF ROE VS. WADE 
RULING AND TO ADOPT A NEUTRAL POSITION. ACTION IS DUE WEDNESDAY.

<P>
A closely divided American Bar Assn. membership on Monday urged its governing 
body to repeal a six-month old policy that endorses a woman's right to choose 
to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
On a vote of 885 to 837, the lawyers recommended that the nation's largest 
legal group drop its support for abortion rights and adopt instead a neutral 
position that is "neither pro-life nor pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 461-member House of Delegates will meet to vote on the ABA's 
abortion policy. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the delegates had decided by a narrow 20-vote margin in Los 
Angeles to adopt an official policy on the abortion issue. Then the delegates 
voted, 238 to 106, in favor of the right to choose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Women's rights advocates saw the ABA stand as an important asset as lawmakers 
in many states were about to reconsider restrictions on abortion. Within the 
ABA, the new abortion rights policy was seen as evidence that women and younger 
lawyers were playing a greater role in a group long dominated by gray-haired 
men. 
</P>
<P>
But many lawyers, women as well as men, branded the new policy as a mistake for 
the organization and a moral outrage to them as individuals. For months, they 
sought support to overturn the policy, and on Monday they took a major step. 
</P>
<P>
"This vote demonstrates how divisive this issue is," said Anthony Palermo, a 
Rochester, N. Y., attorney who sponsored the neutrality resolution. The 48-vote 
victory in the open assembly Monday showed that most lawyers favor a neutral 
stand on such a contentious and personal issue, he said, adding that he is 
"very optimistic" the abortion-rights policy will be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
During debate at the convention, supporters of the current policy said that the 
ABA should not take a "vow of silence" on controversial legal questions, but 
rather should stand firm in behalf of individual and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not 'neutral' about race discrimination. We should not be 'neutral' 
now on women's rights to reproductive freedom," said Roberta Ramo, an attorney 
from Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the abortion-rights policy accused their opponents of having "packed 
the meeting" Monday afternoon and said that the outcome should not influence 
the delegates' vote on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very close vote. It sends no real signal" about the thinking of 
most ABA members on the abortion issue, said Sally Determan, a Washington 
lawyer who sponsored the original abortion-rights policy. "We are still 
confident the House of Delegates is with us." 
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's vote, Determan and other supporters of the abortion policy said 
that a reversal of it this week will be seen nationwide as a "repudiation" of 
the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that made abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
If the House of Delegates fails to overturn the abortion-rights policy 
Wednesday, opponents can challenge it again in another open assembly. If they 
can muster a two-thirds vote against the policy then, the matter would be 
decided by ballots sent to all 360,000 ABA members. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh put in a plug for the proposed 
"neutral" policy on abortion. He noted that an ABA committee will meet 
privately and pass judgment on the qualifications of U.S. Judge David H. 
Souter, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court. Though conceding that he 
has "seen no evidence" of bias by the ABA, Thornburgh said that it "creates a 
perception problem" for the organization to have an official policy in support 
of abortion rights.

As he prepares to step down as Harvard's president after almost two decades, 
Derek Curtis Bok is issuing a serious warning: American universities are 
failing to provide the scholarship and leadership needed to solve society's 
most pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you are looking at entire schools, like schools of education, or 
schools of public administration or social work, whether you look within 
schools at what is really strong . . . you are struck by what an inverse 
correlation there is between what society needs from these institutions and 
what we are taking most seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take some of the basic problems facing our society . . . and then make 
a list of all the things that a university could contribute . . . and ask 
yourself how do all these things rank in the list of priorities of the modern 
university, one is struck by how low they rank." 
</P>
<P>
Bok delivered the critical appraisal during an interview in his office. He 
discussed challenges facing higher education in general and Harvard in 
particular, touching on troublesome issues his successor will face. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Bok, 60, announced that he would resign next June as Harvard's 
25th president. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School, said he wanted 
to tell the search committee that will pick his successor what he told the 
committee that selected him: "Beware of the danger of trying to win the last 
war." 
</P>
<P>
"If you do that, you are getting the wrong set of (presidential) 
characteristics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a central problem that Harvard's new president will face is how to 
avoid becoming so immersed in fund raising, lobbying and other external tasks 
that insufficient time exists to remain a participant in the intellectual 
agenda of the university. 
</P>
<P>
"The external jobs of a university president have gotten so much greater than 
they were 20 years ago," Bok said, "the danger is that presidents will become 
sort of exclusively managers and disconnected from the center of the 
institution, which is, of course, intellectual education and research." 
</P>
<P>
Bok said he would like to tell Harvard's new president: "It is very important 
at Harvard to keep that from happening, and I am sure you will not keep that 
from happening unless you are aware of that problem from the very beginning. 
You are going to have to be much more creative in keeping it from occurring 
than I was. And it took some fairly fancy footwork on my part." 
</P>
<P>
Bok said he would advise his successor to play a pivotal role, "observing what 
is happening in society, observing what is happening in the minds of other 
people, observing what is happening intellectually and then seeing how the 
university can pick and choose among new opportunities thrown up by changes in 
each of these areas." 
</P>
<P>
He outlined some of the opportunities and obstacles Harvard and other 
universities will face during a series of lectures he delivered at Duke 
University this spring. Viewed in the light of his departure, they constitute 
an informal valedictory. 
</P>
<P>
"Most universities continue to do their least impressive work on the very 
subjects where society's need for greater knowledge and better education is 
most acute," Bok told the Duke students. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's president sketched a number of problem areas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grants for research facilities have dropped by 95% since the 1960s, and the 
number of research fellowships funded by the federal government has declined by 
a quarter. Leading departments of engineering and computer science face serious 
shortages of American graduate students. One result: 50% or more of those 
departments' Ph.D. candidates come from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the nation must replace half of its 2.5 million teachers within a few 
years and when public schools badly need more effective methods of instruction, 
graduate schools of education rank low on the totem pole at many universities, 
with low faculty salaries and overcrowded classes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When poverty, homelessness, drug abuse and chronic unemployment are major 
problems, schools of social work are neglected and, "like faculties of 
education, they are poor stepchildren on most university campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 -- American colleges "have not made much headway" in giving students 
sufficient knowledge of foreign languages and cultures so they can have the 
international background necessary for careers. U.S. universities send 60,000 
students to study abroad, versus almost 400,000 foreign students who attend 
U.S. colleges and universities. In addition, fewer American colleges require 
language instruction than 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Regional and international centers specializing in advanced education and 
research "are probably no stronger and may be weaker" than 25 years ago, 
Harvard's president said. Few centers have joint programs with business and 
other professional schools. There are serious shortages of outstanding 
specialists in such fields as the Soviet economy, development economics and 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foundations rarely consult with universities on funding priorities, 
depriving academic officers of a chance to express their views on how 
universities can contribute to important social problems, Bok charged. 
Long-term foundation support has been disappointing in education, poverty and 
public policy. Faculties of education and public administration schools are 
forced "into a hand-to-mouth existence, endlessly seeking new projects that 
funding agencies will support in order to defray the salaries and stipends of 
professors and graduate students." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Federal funding to universities for poverty, education and other areas 
bearing on U.S. competitiveness has fluctuated too widely to build a strong 
base of research and teaching. Further, little discussion exists between 
government and academic officials about how universities can respond to key 
national challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"All things considered," Bok concluded, "in the constant interplay between 
universities and the outside world, neither side has done a satisfactory job of 
promoting the nation's long-term interests." 
</P>
<P>
Bok returned to those themes during the interview in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of education and teaching are at risk in a research university 
because the rewards of society are so powerful in the direction of research," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is voting heavily in favor of research rather than education in where 
it is putting its money and all of the prizes, the visibility, the excitement 
and consulting . . . . We have to be more imaginative in figuring out how to 
develop incentives that will ensure greater attention to teaching." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, in an age of far-reaching scientific discovery, the contribution 
of the humanities, in "what they can tell us about a quality of life, a quality 
of community, a quality of an individual's existence that is really worthwhile" 
should not be downplayed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, in the next 50 years, the realization that scientific knowledge 
is outrunning moral development "will come home to us with terrifying force." 
Fundamental questions will be raised about "what it means to be human and how 
we relate to each other." The humanities will have to be called on in the 
broadest sense to help provide answers, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
When he was appointed in 1971, it was fashionable to argue that the selection 
committee had turned to Bok, then dean of Harvard's law school, because he was 
a crisis manager able to deal with campus unrest. But the search committee was 
convinced -- and events proved it right -- that the crisis on campus would 
disappear only to be replaced by more enduring problems. 
</P>
<P>
In his almost two decades as Harvard's president, Bok presided over significant 
expansion of America's oldest institution of higher learning. Initiatives 
included the establishment of a core curriculum for undergraduates, major 
development of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, revision of the 
Harvard Medical School's curriculum, programs to foster education in ethics and 
more effective college teaching. Scholarship and research on a broad variety of 
problems, including poverty, energy and the environment, international 
security, business and government and AIDS were stressed. 
</P>
<P>
Bok said that one of the roles of a Harvard president is to "move against the 
tide . . . to try to offset one-sided pressures and occurrences that are 
flowing rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Harvard's president often has to balance conflicting psychic 
pressures, Bok said. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Bok explained, danger exists that a new president will be so 
eager to be appreciated that "you really don't have a mind of your own and you 
are simply reacting." On the other hand, there is the danger of being 
thick-skinned because "you don't like all those people out there telling you 
what to do and you don't listen to what you can learn from the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
"You are continuously being tested by people who are trying to put you under 
pressure, subject you to some form of psychological pressure to conform to 
something they want, whether it is a particular issue or whether they are 
trying to get you to conform to a whole image of the presidency they think is 
important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . If you don't think about that before you are into the maelstrom, it can 
easily get to be too little, too late."

U.S. SAYS OIL IS PLENTIFUL, REJECTS PANIC; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: COMPANIES ARE WARNED ABOUT GOUGING. THE FED DECIDES AGAINST ANY 
IMMEDIATE ACTION TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.

<P>
Faced with soaring energy prices and plummeting financial markets, the Bush 
Administration sought Monday to head off an economic panic, assuring Americans 
that world oil supplies are plentiful and warning oil companies to exercise 
restraint in raising prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear that all the price increases that have been reported at the 
consumer level are necessary," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
cautioned. "It would be most unfortunate if there was any gouging or anyone was 
trying to take advantage of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board, caught between fears of a recession and 
the threat of new inflation, decided Monday against taking any immediate action 
to lower interest rates, government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But sources said the policy-makers left open the possibility that the central 
bank may cut short-term rates later if it seems possible to do so without 
raising fears among Wall Street bond traders that the Fed is abandoning its 
effort to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of actions reflects the increasingly tough economic realities 
that the United States finds itself confronting as it responds to last week's 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In financial markets Monday, the stock market took its steepest fall since last 
October, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 93.31 points in the face 
of investor worry about the impact on the economy of rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, oil prices continued to skyrocket. The prices of West Texas 
intermediate, a key grade of crude oil, soared $3.56 a barrel Monday to $28.05 
a barrel -- almost $7 a barrel higher than it was a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the markets were worried is that the Administration's push to 
organize a worldwide economic embargo of the oil produced by Iraq and Kuwait 
adds to inflation pressures and threatens ultimately to tip the economy into a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the patient was dying of cancer, and suddenly he has a heart 
attack," said Kenneth Gerbino, a New York investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the risk of higher prices, the White House is still urging the Fed to 
ease its grip on credit quickly to help keep the economy out of a recession, 
Administration officials indicated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the sluggish state of the economy and the risk of 
recession call for some gradual Fed easing," one senior official said. "Even 
when you superimpose the Iraqi oil situation, it looks like the one-time impact 
on inflation should be relatively modest." 
</P>
<P>
But the official added that "we understand why they (top Fed policy-makers) 
have to be cautious, because there are a lot of uncertain possibilities out 
there right now." 
</P>
<P>
In their move to quell panic buying of oil, officials pointed out that the 
world was already awash with surplus crude before the Iraqi invasion. And they 
suggested that the current supply-and-demand situation does not justify sharp 
price boosts. 
</P>
<P>
"With the current excess world supply of oil, there is no economic reason why 
prices should be going up so much," a top Energy Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers appeared even more skeptical of the recent price boosts, with several 
of them demanding a rollback and an investigation of oil company actions. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) formally asked Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh to launch an antitrust investigation. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Price-gouging' is a harsh term, but it is a term that seems to most aptly 
describe the situation we are now witnessing," Dole said in a letter to 
Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) took a similar tack. "We deserve a price 
rollback," he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast to the rhetoric coming from Capitol Hill, White House officials 
emphasized that they want to avoid any hint that might encourage reimposing 
price controls on the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely critical that we not repeat some of the stupid mistakes of the 
1970s," one senior Administration official said. "If we got price controls, 
then we would have to worry about artificial shortages and gas lines. Nobody 
should want that again." 
</P>
<P>
His reference was to the situation in the 1970s, when price controls imposed 
after the 1973 Arab oil embargo prevented U.S. oil companies from moving 
gasoline to high-demand areas and exacerbated regional shortages, forcing 
motorists to wait in line for hours to buy gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Because prices now are free-floating, energy experts say that the price 
increases can be used to help ration supplies more sensibly and that the nation 
should be able to avoid the kinds of artificial shortages that plagued the 
United States in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson of the 1970s is that it's better to let markets do the work, even 
if they sometimes overreact, rather than trusting in some bureaucrat sitting in 
his office," said John Sawhill, a former top energy official in both the Carter 
and Reagan administrations. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve officials said they, too, are trying to avoid some of the 
economic policy mistakes of the past. Where the Fed eased monetary policy in 
the 1970s, in hopes of cushioning the depressing effects of higher oil prices, 
today it is seeking to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a force for higher inflation and a force for lower 
growth," said Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank 
and a member of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a real danger if people thought Fed policy could be used in any 
dramatic way to deal with these kinds of events," Parry said. In the past, he 
added, "insufficient attention was paid to the inflationary consequences of 
policy in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
As the Administration worked to put the global economic embargo of Iraq in 
place, the Treasury Department clarified its decision last Friday to allow U.S. 
firms to accept shiploads of previously purchased oil from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the oil may be used as long as it was purchased before the ban 
went into effect last Thursday and the tankers in which it is carried arrive at 
the United States by Oct. 1.

IRAQ'S ROUNDUP OF AMERICANS GREATLY LIMITS U.S. OPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: THE ADMINISTRATION EXPANDS ITS CRISIS TASK FORCE TO INCLUDE SPECIALISTS 
ON COUNTERTERRORISM. 
</P>

<P>
The Iraqi decision to round up more than two dozen Americans in Kuwait adds a 
chilling new dimension to the Persian Gulf crisis and sharply complicates the 
options available to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Although their fate remains unclear, the fact that American citizens have been 
detained by Iraqi authorities raises the prospect that they could be used to 
blunt any U.S. response to the invasion of Kuwait, according to experts on the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis are engaged in terrorism now," Robert Kupperman, a Washington-based 
analyst, said. "If (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein has miscalculated and is 
feeling frightened, he now has other forms of retribution." 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of the changed equation, the Bush Administration quietly moved 
for the first time Monday to expand its crisis task force to include government 
specialists in counterterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration pointedly declined to describe the captives as hostages -- a 
move that experts said was a deliberate effort to avoid inflaming the 
situation. The experts added that Iraq too is unlikely ever to use the 
"H-word." 
</P>
<P>
But as President Bush moves to tighten the coils around Hussein, the abrupt 
Iraqi action leaves Americans caught at the fulcrum of the crisis, dashing 
Administration hopes of spiriting its citizens from the scene and raising the 
potential stakes in any U.S. military moves. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 28 U.S. passport holders rousted from three downtown hotels 
Monday, an unspecified number of others have been gathered in a ballroom in the 
Kuwaiti capital, and at least 11 more have been taken to Baghdad and are now 
being held in an Iraqi hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 additional Americans remain unconfined but essentially trapped in 
Kuwait and have no means to leave the country, now occupied by Iraqi troops. 
Most of the Americans are oil workers; others include businessmen, journalists 
and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official said the presence of the Americans has made 
Bush and his advisers particularly wary of any military option involving 
confrontation with Iraqi forces because it would run the risk of an enormous 
loss of U.S. civilian as well as military lives. 
</P>
<P>
That dilemma has been compounded by the taking of the new detainees, analysts 
said. With Americans at risk -- and Iraqi motives still a mystery -- U.S. 
crisis managers may be forced to ascribe to the worst intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know that these are hostages," said Brian Jenkins, a leading 
terrorism expert who is managing director of Crowell Associates in Los Angeles. 
"And even if they were, it would be to nobody's advantage to refer to them as 
such. 
</P>
<P>
"But as we contemplate these moves," Jenkins added, "this becomes part of the 
equation. It is something that we have to reckon with." 
</P>
<P>
Experts said the motivations for the Iraqi roundup could range from an isolated 
decision by a commander acting in the chaos of war to a deliberate effort by 
Hussein to secure insurance against American attack. 
</P>
<P>
Another interpretation is that the move is a signal in an escalating war of 
nerves -- a case, Jenkins suggested, "in which we huff and puff and rattle 
sabers, and the Iraqis do something like this to remind us that they have some 
power too." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motivation, the Iraqi grab Monday of nearly 400 foreigners, 
including the 28 Americans, represents a troubling development in the 
chronicles of war, in which belligerent nations as a rule have made extensive 
efforts to repatriate those caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts cautioned that it would be premature to draw comparisons, 
they said the Iraqi action is most reminiscent of the Iranian 
government-sanctioned seizure of American hostages in the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the latest incident, in which the foreigners were last seen being 
loaded into buses headed toward Iraq, Bush Administration officials said Monday 
they regard the step as a serious breach of international conduct. 
</P>
<P>
But in describing the Americans as "detainees" rather than hostages, the 
Administration sought to put the action in the most favorable possible light as 
part of a strategy designed to minimize the crisis at home and avoid 
unnecessary insult to Hussein, outside experts said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they suggested that Hussein himself is unlikely ever to label 
any American citizens as hostages because such a statement could limit his 
options to release them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little doubt in the minds of those who study hostage-taking that 
the Iraqi move represents at least a tentative effort to shield the nation from 
military or perhaps even economic retribution. 
</P>
<P>
"As there is more evidence that this conflict is going to escalate, it's not at 
all surprising that Iraq is doing this," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert 
at the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the move may have at least thwarted a developing 
plan to evacuate Americans by chartered airplanes that would seek permission to 
land in Kuwait. They confirmed that the U.S. military Delta Force and other 
hostage rescue teams had been moved into the region, but said the large number 
of Americans still stranded would limit their utility. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just going into a hotel room," one well-placed source cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait have 
begun to conduct "welfare and whereabouts inquiries" by telephone in an effort 
to track down Americans in the region. 
</P>
<P>
But the official conceded that telephone lines within Kuwait remain "very bad." 
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that for most of the 
approximately 3,000 Americans in the country, "I don't have anything specific 
other than that they're there." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Americans in Kuwait are employees of American firms that do 
contract work for oil companies, including state-owned Kuwait Oil. The bulk are 
technical personnel, a State Department official said, and are located at oil 
drilling sites around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The largest contractor for Kuwait Oil is Santa Fe International of Alhambra, 
Calif. The company has confirmed that eight of its employees are among the 
Americans already held in Baghdad. In addition, there are a small number of 
Americans in Kuwait who are employees of various airlines or are married to 
Kuwaiti citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of one of the 11 American oil workers picked up by invading Iraqi 
forces and brought to Baghdad last week said in a telephone interview from 
Harmony, Tex., on Monday that her father is "in daily contact with the embassy 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But "as far as anything else, we just don't know," said Karen Amos, whose 
father, Charles Amos, is being held in the Oberoi Rashid Hotel in the Iraqi 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real tough right now," Karen Amos said. She added that the State 
Department "tries to answer as many questions as they can and give as much hope 
as they can. But as far as telling us when Daddy can leave -- they just don't 
know."

KUWAITIS' BEDOUIN PRIDE DAMAGED BY INVASION;

MIDEAST: IRAQI GUNS HAVE BURST THE BUBBLE OF THE RICH LIFESTYLE.

<P>
Their entrance is always impressive -- in a London hotel, a Zurich business 
suite or in one of the sun-baked capitals of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
A door swings open, and in stride three or four stern-faced men in gleaming 
white robes and flowing headdresses, their beards and mustaches neatly trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
The shoes are Bally and the watches Rolex. These are among the richest people 
in the world, per capita, and they move with a confident bearing. 
</P>
<P>
It is a stereotype, but in many cases it is not far off the mark. The Kuwaitis 
have a Bedouin pride, and it has been hurt by Iraq's invasion of their country. 
</P>
<P>
A young college graduate who arrived in Dubai from London over the weekend 
found his Kuwaiti currency worthless as a result of the uncertainty brought on 
by the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a humiliation I have never suffered before," he told a local reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Another arrival, Ali Mohammed, said he had been turned out by a London hotel 
that would not accept his credit card. 
</P>
<P>
"I know London like the back of my hand," he said. "So do many of my friends 
and relatives. We never dreamed that we would find ourselves in such straits, 
and it shook me to learn that the Londoners wouldn't help us even for a few 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed was taken in by friends in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi guns have burst the bubble of the Kuwaiti lifestyle, a 
government-subsidized existence that has made Kuwaitis the envy of the oil-rich 
Persian Gulf region. But the Kuwaitis have come through hard times before. 
</P>
<P>
They are the descendants of a Bedouin clan that sailed up the Persian Gulf from 
the southwestern quarter of the Arabian Peninsula in the late 17th Century, and 
they occupy a small desert country of 6,880 square miles, squeezed between 
powerful neighbors, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
They have been ruled by sheiks of the Sabah family for more than two centuries. 
Through periods of Turkish and British tutelage, Kuwait has grown on the 
fortunes of oil from a tiny port of fishermen, pearl divers and traders. Oil 
was discovered here in 1938, and oil revenues have built a welfare state that 
provides preschools and health services and subsidized housing for the small 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis account for less than 1 million of the 2 million people in their 
country; the others were brought in to build the roads and office blocks of 
modern Kuwait, fill the professional and clerical ranks and work at the hotels 
and restaurants. Foreigners fill eight of 10 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The country has survived repeated territorial demands by Iraqi governments, a 
tumultuous war between Iran and Iraq that raged on its borders in the 1980s, 
and the disastrous collapse of its unregulated stock market in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, Kuwait's culture has been shaped by its location. Arab and 
Persian influences have left their mark, and trade has given the Kuwaitis a 
cunning sense of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The people are strongly religious Muslims with a strain of desert wildness. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch out, these fellows are absolutely mad," a British expatriate warned a 
first-time visitor to the Kuwaiti capital as they drove along the seaside 
highway. Moments later their car was overtaken by a sleek Mercedes going 80 
m.p.h. or more. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the 'Bedu' (Bedouin) in them," he told his rattled passenger. "They've 
traded in their horses for high-powered cars." 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti passion for action, well known at the casinos of London and Monaco, 
was the cause of the fall of the stock exchange. Kuwaitis were playing the 
market with postdated checks. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these same men carry honor and responsibility in their main obligation, the 
commitment to their extended family. The family forms the Kuwaitis' identity. 
The Kuwaiti family has been compared to the Chinese clan: It provides talent, 
connections and financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
Any man or woman who brings dishonor to the clan through unseemly behavior is 
excluded, and without connections he or she is left adrift. 
</P>
<P>
The men's world rotates around the diwaniya, the all-male social gathering that 
takes place in the evening in a special room or outbuilding of the family home. 
Over tea or coffee, visitors play cards, watch videos and, as the evening draws 
on, talk politics and business. 
</P>
<P>
When the ruling Sabah family shut down the Parliament in 1986, the political 
opposition went behind the doors of the diwaniya to map strategy for achieving 
a more democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can work an invitation to a diwaniya," a foreign diplomat advised a 
visitor, "you will see the real Kuwait. There, public formality is set aside. 
They really let their hair down." 
</P>
<P>
The women's lot is more constrained. Islamic modesty is observed, and few women 
leave home without covering their heads and wearing black robes. 
</P>
<P>
Marriages are arranged, and the groom puts up a dowry, which brides often 
invest in gold or property, hedging against the unfortunate day when her 
husband may declare three times "I divorce thee" and she is out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion, while long a possibility, has shattered the Kuwaitis' 
composure. Tearful women, carrying photos of their self-exiled leader, Sheik 
Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, have mounted protest demonstrations in European 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm utterly disgusted at what's happened," a Kuwaiti woman stranded in Dubai 
said. "We never thought it would be carried out."

PALESTINIANS DIVIDED ON IMPACT OF IRAQI MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
OCCUPIED AREAS: SOME ARABS FEEL THE INVASION DIVERTS ATTENTION FROM THEIR 
UPRISING.

<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has caused sharply mixed emotions among 
Palestinians in the occupied territories, as well as divisions of opinion over 
whether President Saddam Hussein's lightning strike last week will further or 
hinder the cause of Palestinian independence. 
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian leaders feel squeezed by the Iraqi move because it diverts 
attention from the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, and it backs up Israeli 
warnings against creating a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
But Palestinians are united in criticizing the United States' call for an 
economic embargo against Iraq, which they see as hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
Doud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian commentator in East Jerusalem, put it this 
way: "In four days, President Bush has gained worldwide support against the 
Iraqi invasion. But 23 years have elapsed since the Israeli occupation of the 
West Bank and Gaza, and Israel still counts on economic and moral support from 
the West." 
</P>
<P>
According to Kuttab, the Palestinian masses strongly support Iraq's President 
Saddam Hussein, who is widely known by his first name in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"The gut feeling on the street," he said, "is mostly favorable to the invasion. 
People had little hope that Kuwait's Sabah family would really help liberate 
the Palestinians. To them, Saddam is an Arab patriot -- and a strong one -- 
willing to use oil as a political weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time," he said, "intellectuals have mixed feelings: Some worry 
that the invasion will only direct attention away from the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict and will justify Israel's procrastination in dealing with the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erakat, a professor of political science at An Najah University in Nablus, 
said he believes that ordinary Palestinians have been stirred by the sense of 
change generated by the Iraqi president. 
</P>
<P>
"People are happy that Saddam has shaken up the Arab world," Erakat said. "The 
feeling is that Israel cannot be forced into a peace process unless it is 
deterred by political changes in the Arab world." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion comes as the 2 1/2-year-old Palestinian uprising appears to 
be running out of steam, and with the peace process on hold, according to 
Kuttab, "people think this may get the Palestinian issue moving again." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers that support the Palestine Liberation Organization generally 
supported the Iraqi invasion, as did Al Quds, the independent Jerusalem paper. 
</P>
<P>
But other newspapers, and ordinary Palestinians, have begun to express concern 
about the 300,000 Palestinians who work in Kuwait -- in the oil fields, in 
commerce and in government -- and about the $100 million or more they send home 
every year. These people are a major source of support for relatives in the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians remember the discrimination they experienced in Kuwait, where 
they found that even second-generation Palestinians could not obtain 
citizenship or residence papers, only working permits. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have no love for the ruling Sabah family of Kuwait. The 
Sabahs, they complain, have provided more funds for the rebels in Afghanistan 
than for the Palestinian cause. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders are calling for an early settlement of the situation in 
Kuwait. In East Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian activist, 
urged "both sides to stop fighting and solve the conflict in a diplomatic way." 
</P>
<P>
Radwan abu Ayyash, president of the Arab Journalists' Assn., said the Iraqi 
move has diverted attention from the Palestinian problem and added, "I call on 
our Arab brethren to stop all acts of war and seek peaceful means to solve 
their conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Saleh Abdel Jawad, head of the history and political science department at Bir 
Zeit University in Ramallah, said the Palestinian position has suffered at the 
expense of Israel because of Iraq's action. 
</P>
<P>
"The invasion has resulted in support for Israel's position," he said. "It 
showed that the Palestinian position is not the main problem in the Middle 
East, and showed Iraq as an aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel will exploit this invasion in order to consolidate its position. Even 
before the invasion, I hinted at the negative impact of (Hussein's) statements 
against Israel, which Israel exploited very well. (Hussein) has also created an 
uncomfortable situation for the PLO and the Palestinians, at a time when they 
don't need to be a party to inter-Arab differences." 
</P>
<P>
Jawad said he is worried about the future of Palestinians working in Kuwait and 
the money they send home, since their well-paying jobs could be taken over by 
trained Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Palestinians in Kuwait," he said, "will lose this independence, 
and their cultural and financial wealth, in favor of the regime in Iraq."

FEW U.S. ASSETS IN KUWAIT COULD BE SEIZED

Threats by Iraq's new proxy government in Kuwait to nationalize foreign 
property are not causing undue alarm in the United States: There are few 
American assets in Kuwait and little foreign investment in the country in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
State and Commerce department officials in Washington said they could not come 
up with an estimate of the value of American investment in Kuwait. But federal 
government sources said the value is considerably less than $1 billion and may 
amount to no more than a few hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a large sum," Elizabeth Dugan, a spokeswoman for the 
Commerce Department, said. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said Kuwait has prohibited foreign investment except through joint 
ventures in which Kuwaitis hold a majority stake. A Commerce Department list 
includes the names of 57 American companies participating in joint ventures in 
Kuwait. But many of the ventures are small, and the list is out of date. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the ventures listed actually are only contracts for services, and 
officials of the American companies involved said in interviews that they do 
not actually own assets in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
For example, both the Boeing Co. and the Douglas Aircraft subsidiary of 
McDonnell Douglas Corp. are listed as being involved in joint ventures for 
aviation support services. But spokesmen for both organizations said that 
although they have small numbers of employees stationed in Kuwait, they do not 
own property or equipment there. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said American concerns have virtually no investment in Iraq, 
which has for some time prohibited foreign investment by non-Arab investors. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia, however, could jeopardize considerably more 
American assets. William T. Archy, a vice president of the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce in Washington, said that as of 1986, the most recent year for which 
figures are available, direct American investment in Saudi Arabia was worth 
$2.4 billion -- of which almost $1 billion was directly related to petroleum 
production. Another large portion of the $2.4 billion represents U.S. 
petrochemical interests in Saudi Arabia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among companies that confirmed Monday that they do own assets in Kuwait are 
Texaco, the oil company, and Halliburton, an oil-well services company. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Anita Larsen said Texaco owns a small refinery in Kuwait and a 50% 
interest in the production of oil in an area known as the "neutral zone," which 
straddles the frontier between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Larsen said total 
production from the area amounts to about 135,000 barrels a day but declined to 
place a value on Texaco's interests there. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Halliburton said the company owns equipment in Kuwait "related 
to our oil field services business."

A manhunt has ended with the arrest of a second suspect in the July 29 shooting 
of a California Highway Patrol officer whose life was saved by a bulletproof 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Lee Allen, 34, was arrested at his Vallejo home, a CHP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Eugene Mulata was shot twice in the chest and four times in the back 
after making a traffic stop near Crockett. Because he was wearing a bulletproof 
vest, he suffered only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Allen handed a .44-caliber revolver to Jeffery Shawn 
Rendall, 29, of American Canyon after the officer stopped their stolen pickup 
truck for speeding. Rendall is suspected of firing the shots. 
</P>
<P>
Rendall was arrested last Monday after a police dog found him in a crawl space 
under a building in Crockett. Why Allen returned home and where he had been 
hiding was not known.

BAN ON AUTO RATE HIKES TO BE EXTENDED; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: GILLESPIE SAYS THE PRICE FREEZE WILL LAST UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
HEARINGS ON PROPOSITION 103. HER AIDE SAYS THE WAIT MAY BE EVEN LONGER.

<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday she intends to extend her 
10-month-old freeze on auto insurance rates in California through the 
completion of hearings scheduled to begin next month on rate rollbacks called 
for under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's special counsel for Proposition 103 implementation, Karl 
Rubinstein, went further, saying that no rate increases will be granted until 
the insurance company's appeals expected on the rollback orders for 1989 
premiums are litigated to the appellate court level. The orders mandate rebates 
to customers of part of the 1989 premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein's remarks indicated that any rate hikes for auto insurance could be 
delayed several months at least. Insurers had anticipated that they would be 
allowed to raise rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
The statements about extending the rate freeze came after four leading consumer 
advocacy organizations announced they will not participate in a different set 
of hearings Gillespie has scheduled on approval of new, possibly higher future 
rates for auto insurers. 
</P>
<P>
The groups -- Voter Revolt, Consumers Union, Latino Issues Forum and Public 
Advocates -- said they object to the retired state Court of Appeal judge the 
insurance commissioner has named to preside over the hearings because as a 
"rent-a-judge" he has in the past worked for insurance companies on a number of 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Gillespie on Monday, officials of the consumers organizations 
said the judge, James Scott, admitted to them in a pre-hearing conference last 
week that he had been paid by insurance companies whose rate applications he 
would be hearing, but he had refused to recuse himself. They asked Gillespie to 
remove him. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie and Rubinstein said Monday they believe Scott will be fair to all 
sides. Also, they said, all final decisions for future rates resulting from the 
hearings beginning Wednesday will be made by Gillespie and held in abeyance 
pending outcome of the rollback hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The groups maintain that the hearings on future rates should not begin until 
the rollback hearings are complete. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said Monday that the rollback hearings require 30 days' advance 
notice, and if she waits on finishing them to begin the hearings on future 
rates, "it will needlessly delay the entire Proposition 103 implementation 
process." 
</P>
<P>
A special counsel to Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp on insurance matters, 
Fredric Woocher, said Monday he is concerned that Gillespie may be trying to 
establish pro-insurer hearing procedures in advance of a new elected 
commissioner taking office in January that will tie that commissioner's hands 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an attorney for State Farm, the state's largest seller of auto 
insurance, disclosed Monday that at this week's hearings State Farm is asking 
for approval of rates it has had in effect since last year and not for any rate 
increase.

SUSPENSION OF OPEN-MEETING LAW CREATES A STATEWIDE STIR

Although a little-noticed provision of the state budget suspends an 
open-meeting law for city councils and other local elected bodies, many local 
elected officials say they will continue to post an agenda 72 hours before any 
meeting, stick to that agenda and allow public testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Budget-writers suspended the open-meeting law for a year as a cost-saving 
measure. A recent study indicated that it would cost the state more than $2 
million annually to reimburse local governments for the cost of complying with 
the law, although some critics contend it actually would cost much less. 
</P>
<P>
Public interest groups and newspaper editorialists are furious about the move, 
saying it will allow local lawmakers to conduct shady, back-room dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a disaster for open meetings at the local level," said Ruth 
Holton, a lobbyist for Common Cause. "There are unscrupulous local agencies 
that will no doubt be delighted now to hold meetings without the public's 
knowledge and without public comment." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in a number of Southern California cities said Monday they intend to 
follow the provisions of the now-suspended law. Many said they posted agendas 
and allowed public comment before it was required and will continue to do so 
even though it is no longer a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who called the Legislature's 
action "a tragedy," has introduced a resolution that would require the council 
to continue posting agendas and allowing public input. The council, which 
prompted the open-meeting law in the first place by passing a 10% pay raise for 
itself in 1985 without public notice, is scheduled to consider that measure 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, John Sweeten, director of the Intergovernment and Public 
Affairs Office, said: "I can't foresee any change at all. Our board's policy 
has always been to fully disclose things." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays agreed. "We're pretty used to the current 
procedures," he said. "As long as I'm mayor, we'll continue to have public 
comments. It's very important to have community input in local government and 
it's important to have agenda postings." 
</P>
<P>
The open-meeting law was one of 19 state mandates -- including a requirement 
that police officers provide assistance to stranded motorists and that judges 
consider victims' statements when sentencing felons -- that were suspended this 
year to achieve a claimed savings of $59 million. 
</P>
<P>
James Apps, a budget analyst for the Department of Finance, said most of those 
requirements were "totally unnecessary" because local government would perform 
the functions even if the state didn't pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) introduced legislation Monday to reinstate the 
law. Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), author of the 1986 
open-meeting law, said he would follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any public entities are going to abuse the law in the next year, 
but the potential is there," Connelly said. "There is a history of public 
entities acting without public notice. In some instances it's negligence, but 
in other instances it may have been intended." 
</P>
<P>
So far no state money has been paid out because of the open-meeting requirement 
and only one local agency -- the Los Angeles City Council, which asked for 
$12,000 in 1987 -- has ever filed for reimbursement. Another local board, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, estimated it would cost $1.6 million 
over four years to pay for the posting of agendas and allowing public 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics challenge those numbers, however. "That's just junk. It has no 
basis in fiscal reality. It's not going to cost the state a dime to enforce 
this mandate," said Connelly, adding that it is relatively inexpensive to type 
and post a two- or three-page agenda.

An eight-day manhunt ended with the arrest of a second suspect in the July 29 
shooting of a California Highway Patrol officer whose life was saved by a 
bulletproof vest. Matthew Lee Allen, 34, was arrested at his Vallejo home, a 
CHP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Eugene Mulata was shot twice in the chest and four times in the back 
after making a traffic stop near Crockett. Because he was wearing a bulletproof 
vest, he suffered only minor injuries. Investigators said Allen handed a 
.44-caliber revolver to Jeffery Shawn Rendall, 29, of American Canyon after the 
officer stopped their stolen pickup truck for speeding. Rendall is suspected of 
firing the shots. Rendall was arrested last Monday after a police dog found him 
in a crawl space under a building in Crockett. Why Allen returned home and 
where he had been hiding was not known. Authorities said both men have criminal 
records.

LAWMAKERS RETURN TO EMPTY CAPITAL CUPBOARD; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: AUSTERE NEW BUDGET LEAVES NO MONEY FOR PET SPENDING BILLS. THE 
GOVERNOR SAYS HE WILL OPPOSE ANY MAJOR APPROPRIATIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
State legislators ended their abbreviated five-day vacation and straggled back 
to a brutishly hot capital on Monday to find the cupboard picked virtually bare 
of money to pay for their pet spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
The newly enacted $55.7-billion state budget is so austere that money 
customarily available in rosier times to finance expanded state programs 
devised by the Legislature is now almost non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gov. George Deukmejian is in control of the state's pocketbook and 
has shown every indication that he intends to leave office in January as 
tightfisted as when he arrived in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that the Legislature recognizes the critical fiscal situation the 
state is in," Deukmejian press secretary Robert J. Gore said Monday after 
conferring with the governor. "We don't expect to see any new major 
appropriations bills." 
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the Administration "as a standard position, will oppose any new 
spending bills." 
</P>
<P>
The costs of any general-fund spending bills Deukmejian did sign would have to 
come at the expense of the $1.3-billion reserve for economic uncertainties that 
he fought for during budget negotiations last month. He intends to safeguard 
the surplus against any intrusions, his aides have warned. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it crappy to be back?" one senator complained as he slumped into his 
Appropriations Committee seat behind a thick binder of about 200 spending 
measures with seemingly no chance of becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
Another testy member of the committee, veteran Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), 
surveyed the barren fiscal situation and told his colleagues: "I just think 
what we are doing is a waste of time. There's no money." 
</P>
<P>
Their scheduled four-week vacations cut down to only five days because of last 
month's prolonged delay in enacting a budget, legislators returned to baking 
105-degree heat to complete their 1990 agenda by Aug. 31 and set out on 
reelection campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Unfinished business includes such tasks as making automobile insurance more 
affordable to some California motorists, providing health insurance to 5 
million people who cannot afford it and requiring earthquake insurance for 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list also is the tailoring of a comprehensive offshore oil-spill 
cleanup program to deal with catastrophic tanker accidents like the one in 
Alaska last year. Two competing proposals, both financed by a new 
25-cent-a-barrel tax on oil, would create the cleanup program. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three major insurance matters, an earthquake coverage bill probably has 
the best chance of passage. A measure sponsored by Deukmejian has cleared the 
Senate and is pending in the Assembly, where it is expected to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would slap a surcharge averaging $36 on every homeowner insurance 
policy in the state. The money would go into a state fund. After an earthquake, 
residents would get up to $15,000 in coverage for structural damage. The 
proposal is meant to supplement private earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating possible criticism that the plan is too limited, Sen. Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier), who is carrying the bill, said the measure is not intended to be 
the "ultimate solution" to the earthquake insurance issue. 
</P>
<P>
On automobile insurance, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) is 
negotiating with the governor in hopes of creating a low-cost policy that would 
make insurance affordable to motorists now breaking the law by driving without 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive overhaul of the auto insurance system is unlikely this year. 
But Brown continues to push a more limited proposal under which drivers no 
longer would be required to carry insurance that includes coverage for the 
"pain and suffering" they cause others in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
By limiting the state's minimum insurance requirements in this way, Brown hopes 
to reduce the cost of coverage for low-income drivers who have no assets to 
protect. More affluent motorists would be expected to keep buying the liability 
coverage, even if it is made optional. Otherwise, they would risk losing 
everything they owned if found liable in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
On health insurance, Deukmejian started the year by pledging to enact a major 
health bill that would provide insurance for most Californians who lack even 
basic medical coverage. But the governor began to back away from the issue when 
a task force he appointed failed to agree on a plan that could satisfy the 
half-dozen interest groups with a stake in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a month remaining in the legislative session, rank-and-file 
lawmakers have all but abandoned hope of passing a health insurance package. 
Even participants in the private talks have conceded that the chances are slim. 
With no taxpayer funds available to subsidize insurance for the poor, the only 
alternative would be to put the bulk of the burden on the business community -- 
an unlikely political scenario. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be very difficult," said Democratic Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
of Los Angeles, a key player in the negotiations.

The one-time campaign manager for a Colombian presidential candidate killed by 
drug traffickers takes over the office himself today, hoping to enlist more 
foreign aid in the continuing war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Gaviria of the Liberal Party assumes the presidency at a time when drug 
lords have declared a cease-fire, several leftist guerrilla groups are talking 
peace, and there is an agreement to reform Colombia's 104-year-old 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, violence continues. Last week police said they found three Uzi 
submachine guns that were part of a terrorist plan to disrupt the inauguration. 
Gaviria was campaign manager for Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, an anti-drug crusader 
assassinated last year.

On Saturday, the Chinese official begins a three-day visit to Singapore, which

<P>
Both Indonesia and Singapore cite the promise of improved trade relations with 
Asia's most populous potential market as one reason for rapprochement, while 
China seeks to enhance its standing in the region to counterbalance U.S. and 
Japanese influence. Beijing's decision to stop supporting most Communist rebels 
in the region has helped open the way for better ties.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Nunes smiled approvingly as a clutch of agitated soldiers grasped their 
automatic rifles and bolted past the front porch of her small clapboard house 
near the Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) station where radical Muslim 
rebels were holding 29 hostages behind a barricade of booby-trapped vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged government worker seemed unperturbed by the occasional bursts 
of small-arms fire just a block away. 
</P>
<P>
"Come in and wash your face and have a glass of rum," she called out in a 
traditional gesture of Trinidadian hospitality to a group of harried foreign 
journalists who had paused to take cover. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting placidly in her porch rocker with a half-emptied glass in her hand, 
Nunes said she would be happy if the soldiers stormed the station and the Red 
House Parliament building where 42 more members of the radical Jamaat al 
Muslimeen rebel group were holding Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson and 17 
other senior government officials captive. 
</P>
<P>
But even though she shared widespread feelings against the unpopular prime 
minister for austerity policies that have pinched the incomes of most 
Trinidadians, she hoped he would not be killed or forcibly ousted from power 
during the hostage ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the sonuvabitch either," she said, her rocker thumping 
emphatically on the porch floorboards. "But we'll vote him out our own way, not 
by hostage takin'. Don't be takin' the choice out of my hands!" 
</P>
<P>
Her implacably democratic feelings were shared by many in the devastated 
capital city, even among those who virtually wiped out Trinidadian commerce and 
industry with five days of rampant pillaging when law and order broke down on 
the first night of the hostage crisis. The rebel leader, Yasin abu Bakr, had 
counted on such disaffected people to join his aborted revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Why he did not succeed in turning the violent seizure of Parliament and the 
broadcast center into a full-scale revolution was clear as the waters of the 
Caribbean to the country's leading sociologist, Dr. Selwyn Ryan of the 
University of the West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
"Trinidadians play cricket, and cricket is a game of rules that must be 
respected," he said as if that explained the matter. "People who play cricket 
don't make revolutions. It isn't cricket." 
</P>
<P>
As for the lawlessness and looting that left Port of Spain's once sparkling 
Independence Square commercial center looking as burned out as downtown West 
Beirut, the editor of a leading local newspaper had an equally benign and 
probably correct explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not complicated by racial hostilities or an uprising of the 
dispossessed or that sort of thing, because all races and classes appeared to 
take part," he said. "It was simply people taking something for nothing in the 
absence of visible law and order. That's not peculiar to Trinidadians." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Muslimeen rebels themselves, hardly anyone in Port of Spain 
thought the seizure of the hostages was a revolutionary act. Most of those 
interviewed on the streets agreed with Col. Joseph Theodore, the armed forces 
chief, when he called it a simple act of terrorism, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"(Abu) Bakr expected the people to rise up like revolutionaries and help him," 
said a businessman who declined to give his name. "Instead they rose up and 
helped themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The wild carnival atmosphere of the looting during the first three days of the 
hostage crisis already has provided the material for legend. Lennox Murray, a 
local devotee of traditional Caribbean calypso music, said he knows several 
calypso composers and singers who are already at work immortalizing some of the 
Herculean looting feats they witnessed on the flame-lit streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of it, Mon! ," Murray exulted. "Usually take six Trinidadians to move a 
refrigerator 10 feet. Now we see one man take a fridge six blocks on his head. 
What a song!" 
</P>
<P>
The question of why the looters burned down so many buildings, including some 
of the city's most modern office structures, remains a puzzle, but like 
everything else that happened here last week, there were many uninformed 
rumors. A cab driver named Joe Winter said he knew for a fact that Libyan arson 
squads had come ashore from ships to accompany the looters. 
</P>
<P>
Winter also claimed positive knowledge that a U.S. Navy task force lurking just 
offshore "blew them Libyan boats sky-high right out of the water." When 
challenged with the obvious fact that no warships were in sight, Winter blandly 
amended his report. "They were submarines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Winter's rumors were wholly fabricated, talk of a Libyan connection 
had a basis in fact. Abu Bakr is known to have visited Libya and received 
financial support from its radical leader Col. Moammar Kadafi, according to 
Trinidad and Tobago police who have had him under surveillance for six years. 
Some of his men received military training in Libya as well, the police said. 
But they said that they have found no evidence that Libya had anything to do 
with Abu Bakr's violent takeover of the Parliament and broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
Before founding the radical Muslim sect and turning to violence, Abu Bakr was a 
respected, law-and-order mounted policeman. For lack of a better explanation of 
Abu Bakr's recent behavior, The Guardian, a local newspaper, reported that he 
underwent an abrupt change of personality after being medically discharged from 
the police. The medical reason for the discharge, the newspaper said, was that 
Abu Bakr had become addled after his horse kicked him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the final outcome for Abu Bakr and his 111 fellow hostage takers, now 
in military custody and likely facing charges of treason and murder, they will 
not have a home to return to if their freedom ever is restored. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings of the nine-acre religious commune that the sect built on squatter 
land north of Port of Spain burst mysteriously into flames two days after the 
crisis ended on Wednesday. No one seemed to know who started the fires, but 
they centered on the plush four-bedroom apartment of Abu Bakr in a building 
that contained the commune's shops. 
</P>
<P>
Before the fire, journalists were taken on an army-sponsored tour of the 
commune and found it totally, and apparently hurriedly, abandoned by the wives 
and children of the insurgents. Discarded clothing and other possessions of the 
radical Muslims littered the buildings and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like Jonestown without the bodies," said Bernard Diederich of Time 
magazine, who covered the 1979 mass suicide in Guyana of the followers of the 
Rev. Jim Jones, another rebel who claimed a religious mission to purify a 
corrupt world.

MUNICH, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Siegmar Klebenow came face to face with capitalism for the first time at a 
Bavarian butcher shop. He nearly fainted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stared at all the meats," the 26-year-old East German emigrant 
recalled. "There were so many of them! I looked so hard, I couldn't see 
anymore. It made me dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to run outside for air." 
</P>
<P>
Eight months after he crossed the border with a caravan of friends, Klebenow 
considers himself well-adapted, "a genuine West German." 
</P>
<P>
But the transition from a plodding, socialist society to a bustling capitalist 
one has not always been easy, and now the demands as well as the choices 
occasionally leave Klebenow gasping. 
</P>
<P>
"It's completely different," he says. "I'm perfectly happy, and I would never 
go back, even after reunification, but life is totally different here." 
</P>
<P>
More than half a million East German refugees have streamed across the West 
German border in the last year, looking for better jobs, better pay, a better 
life. Klebenow, who found work at a Lowenbrau brewery here, is one of the lucky 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Of 192,152 East Germans who emigrated in the first six months of this year 
alone, an estimated 90,400 remain unemployed, according to Bonn government 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Some who do find jobs soon quit, or are fired, because they cannot adapt to the 
faster pace and higher demands of Western production. Others move on when they 
cannot find affordable housing, which Lowenbrau said was the case with three 
other East Germans it hired. 
</P>
<P>
The East German government estimates that 150,000 workers are now commuting to 
jobs in West Berlin, while an unknown number shuttle between jobs in West 
Germany and homes in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Pritzwalk, a village of 360 near Potsdam, Klebenow worked on a 
collective dairy farm as a shift supervisor. His nine-person unit managed 600 
cows. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to keep track of what each cow was fed, what shots they had, how much 
milk they produced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, not many people wanted to go into this field of work, and we 
were short-handed all the time," he said. "We had to work 220 to 250 hours a 
month. Eight-hour days, but we had to work 11 days in a row, then two days off, 
then switch to the night shift for another 11 days on, two days off, and so 
on." 
</P>
<P>
He earned 800 marks (about $500) a month, plus a free hot lunch each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I earn four times that," he said with a broad grin, "and the work isn't as 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Klebenow found his Western job filling beer bottles "too boring. I 
was used to more physical labor, and more responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
But he soon became fascinated by the technology and now hopes to learn more 
about the computers that guide beer bottles through the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Klebenow has already earned a promotion to bottle inspector and monitors three 
different machines from a computer screen that tells him what is happening to 
any given bottle during the filling process -- the brewery's equivalent of an 
air traffic controller. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the East Germans who come over and don't make it are overwhelmed by 
the technology," Klebenow said. "There are hardly any computers over there at 
all, but over here, school kids have them. 
</P>
<P>
"That worries me some. The education differences, I mean. Because our education 
systems are so different, it would be hard for me to go back to school here." 
</P>
<P>
Klebenow has no great ambitions at Lowenbrau. He spends 80 marks a month -- 
about $50 -- for a factory dorm room across the street from the brewery. He 
shares a room, a bath and a small kitchen with three other men.

"I'm saving my money to buy some property," he said. "I miss open land. The 
toughest part has been coming to a big, anonymous city from a small village 
where everybody knows everybody, and someone in the next village always knows 
someone you know, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"Back there, I could get on a motorbike and be right there in a place where I 
could just ride through fields all afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he owns a 10-year-old car. "I never dreamed two years ago that I would 
ever own a Volkswagen!" he said. "I'm so proud of it! " 
</P>
<P>
He returns to East Germany often to visit his ailing mother and the 5-year-old 
son who lives with his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I went by the dairy once, and they were still waiting for the new automatic 
milking machines they had been promised ages ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones they have now are 11 years old. The dairy will probably go under 
before the new ones ever arrive. It's not efficient. Under central planning, we 
had to overproduce milk to meet goals. Thousands of liters would go bad and be 
used to feed pigs." 
</P>
<P>
Klebenow got his brewery job through an amazing stroke of luck on his very 
first day in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The four-car caravan of 14 villagers from Pritzwalk left Nov. 9 for the Czech 
border, where the East Germans had heard they could cross freely into West 
Germany. They were well on their way when they heard that the Berlin Wall had 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they reached the border, traffic was backed up for 30 miles. It 
took them 21 hours to inch their way to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
When the sputtering caravan reached Munich, the friends stopped a man on the 
street to ask directions to the refugee camp. The Bavarian took all 14 home for 
coffee and cake. He was a beer distributor, and a friend of Lowenbrau's 
personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
Klebenow was a novelty at the brewery, the sole East German among 750 workers. 
"People wanted to know everything about me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when co-workers ask him to join them for a drink after work, or at a 
soccer match, Klebenow begs off. 
</P>
<P>
"Work is work, and my private life is separate," he declares. 
</P>
<P>
He readily admits that this may well be a throwback to his East German life, 
when secret police would infiltrate factories or recruit workers to spy on each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"Pubs were the very worst -- that's where the most people were arrested," he 
said. "You never knew when the bar had 'ears,' you know, an informant. And if 
you're drinking, your guard is down and you might say something that could get 
you in trouble. It's hard to break that taboo against talking about what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Other lessons from East Germany have been easier to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Now Klebenow chuckles at the anti-capitalist propaganda he continually heard 
from teachers and youth group leaders. The portrait they painted of the West 
was Dickensian. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us that, in the West, if you overslept even once, you were 
immediately fired from your job without a penny, and that you would get fired 
if you got sick." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he is reluctant to blame Marxism for East Germany's collapse, and 
launches into a tirade about the city of Karl-Marx-Stadt changing its name back 
to the original, Chemnitz. 
</P>
<P>
"That's sheer nonsense," he said. "I hear it's costing them 10 million marks 
just to change all the signs. Ten million! There are better things to spend 
that money on over there. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl Marx couldn't say in the 1800s how we would live in the 20th Century," he 
added, launching into a monologue about the East German political scene. 
</P>
<P>
Klebenow raves on for a few minutes before sputtering to a sheepish stop, as if 
stunned to hear himself expressing such opinions out loud. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never go back," he says.

A MONK IN A MESS IS THE TALK OF ALL THAILAND A BUDDHIST ABBOT SAYS HE PAID 
$200,000 TO A WOMAN WHO SAID HE WAS THE FATHER OF HER UNBORN BABY. HE IS 
SOUTHEAST ASIA'S ANSWER TO JIM BAKKER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a faint echo of the Jim Bakker story in the United States, the Thai news 
media have been held spellbound for the past month by a sex scandal involving a 
prominent Buddhist monk. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has been front-page news since the monk, Phra Nikorn Dhammavadi, 
the abbot of a temple in the northern city of Chiang Mai, complained to the 
police that he was forced to pay $200,000 to a woman in an extortion case. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Ornpraweena Bootkhuntong, a 23-year-old law student, caused a 
sensation when she replied that she was four months pregnant and that the monk 
was the father of her child. 
</P>
<P>
Like their Roman Catholic counterparts, Buddhist monks take vows of celibacy 
and poverty. Thus, Phra Nikorn, one of the most revered spiritual leaders of 
northern Thailand, stood doubly under suspicion: He was accused of breaking his 
celibacy vow -- a charge he vehemently denied -- and disturbing questions were 
raised about how the supposedly impoverished head of a monastery could have 
enough money to nevertheless pay off the lady involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to ask how a monk, who according to the vinaya (monastic code) 
cannot even touch money, let alone own it, could write a check for as much as 5 
million baht ($200,000) to pay off what he calls blackmail," a Buddhist 
scholar, Suewanna Satha-anand, said in one newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The monk scandal not only has an obvious titillation factor, but it is causing 
many Thais to reflect on the moral values of their society as it changes from a 
largely agrarian country to an industrial power. 
</P>
<P>
As Sanitsuda Ekachai of the Bangkok Post observed, the revelations about the 
monk just added "to the slow erosion of their image as the spiritual leaders of 
society." 
</P>
<P>
While Thailand may be known abroad as a place for tourists to come and cavort 
licentiously, it has remained a paradoxically conservative society where 
Playboy magazines are not widely available for sale and films are heavily 
censored. 
</P>
<P>
More than 95% of the population are followers of Buddhism, a fact that helps 
define Thai society. It is still common to see people offering a wai -- a 
hands-pressed obeisance -- as they pass in front of a Buddhist shrine, even 
while driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, it was not uncommon for young men of high-school age to become 
Buddhist monks for several months as part of the family's effort at merit 
making, a key Buddhist precept. The monks in their saffron robes can be seen 
wandering in towns and cities seeking alms, such as gifts of food. But 
recruiting of young monks has reportedly fallen off as graduates compete for 
high-paying jobs and the good life of young urban professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The Phra Nikorn scandal is the second major Buddhist scandal in a year. Several 
months ago, the Buddhist hierarchy defrocked a highly popular monk who, like 
Protestant Reformation leader Martin Luther, established a sect that rejected 
the increasing wealth and worldly ways of the clergy. News accounts uncovered 
an increasingly affluent lifestyle even for those who had adopted the ascetic 
life, including one monastery equipped with walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
Once the dam burst over Phra Nikorn, the Thai-language press began printing 
evidence of his misdeeds. One photo showed him in white pajamas in a wedding 
ceremony with Ornpraweena, which for sheer shock value was the equivalent of a 
picture of a Roman Catholic cardinal tying the knot in a Las Vegas wedding 
chapel. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to Phra Nikorn's plea that he hardly knew the girl, the newspapers 
published photos of the two on vacation in various spots abroad, including the 
United States, which indicated the relationship had been long term and 
intimate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most damaging of all, the press began focusing on the wealth 
accumulated by abbots such as Phra Nikorn, showing them driving about Bangkok 
in chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz limousines. In the traditional system under 
which monasteries operate, the abbot can use public donations in any manner he 
wants. According to recent newspaper articles, it has opened the system to 
abuse, particularly from young women seeking riches. 
</P>
<P>
While Thailand has experienced one of the highest rates of industrial growth in 
the world over the last five years, the wealth has not been distributed evenly. 
There are many new Thai millionaires, but at the same time the working class in 
Bangkok complains vocally about being less and less able to afford life in the 
industrial metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing their avowedly poverty-stricken clergy living like millionaires has 
clearly deeply offended many Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you see a man wearing saffron (the colors of a monk's robes), you 
can't assume that he is a monk," said the mass-market Thai Rath newspaper. "It 
needs a lot of consideration. If we happen to pay respect to a half-man, 
half-monk, it may be a waste of time and effort."

CHARGERS RELEASE ARCHER; GET DOWN TO 3 QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
He was the fourth quarterback, and there was really only room for three. 
</P>
<P>
So David Archer, a veteran of six NFL seasons and a longtime favorite of Coach 
Dan Henning, was released by the Chargers Monday. He left camp quickly without 
much commotion, which, when you think about it, is about the way his career 
with the Chargers went. Quickly. Very little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joe Tolliver, the Chargers' starting quarterback, spoke with Archer 
briefly before he left camp. Tolliver has lost a bit of competition but also a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty down about it," Tolliver said. "I hated that it was Dave because 
he's a good friend of mine. When you've got a close friend and something 
happens to them you hurt a little bit, too. But Dave will be the first to tell 
you that you've got to press on." 
</P>
<P>
Archer was brought in by Henning to compete for the starting job at last 
summer's camp. In 1986, when Henning was coach of the Atlanta Falcons, Archer 
was his starting quarterback. Atlanta and Archer made a big splash at the start 
of the season, when the Falcons won five of their first six games and Archer 
put together the top-rated passing statistics in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Five games later, Archer separated his shoulder and his career has since been 
filled with a host of rejections. He has been cut four times in three years, 
and when Jim McMahon was shipped in from Chicago last August Archer became 
little more than a high-priced spectator. 
</P>
<P>
Archer's departure allows Henning to work the other three quarterbacks -- 
Tolliver, Mark Vlasic and rookie John Friesz -- with the frequency needed to 
evaluate them properly during preseason. Henning said Tolliver would likely get 
50 snaps in practice, Vlasic and Friesz 25 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time we can't work more than three," Henning said. "Over the last week 
I've evaluated the situation with John Friesz and Vlasic. I've seen some good 
improvement, some positive signs that their potential is higher than I thought 
it was in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
After being relegated to backup last season, Archer didn't prove to be 
particularly valuable as a sideline quarterback. Considering Archer has only 
thrown 37 regular-season passes in the past three years and Henning thinks of 
him more as a starter than a backup, the decision was clear if not easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision for Dan because he's (Archer) been with Dan all that 
time," Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said. "But Dan just felt it was 
time to make the change." 
</P>
<P>
Archer had expressed concern throughout this camp that, unlike Henning, 
Beathard hadn't had the opportunity to take a good look at him because of the 
limited number of snaps he was getting in practice. 
</P>
<P>
To that, Beathard responded: "He's wrong. I did know him. I've seen a lot of 
him. We had him in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Archer has been in the league long enough that what you see is 
what you get and I don't think there's any potential there. The other guy 
(Vlasic) continues to rise. How good he can get, I don't know. But he's still 
going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the Houston Oilers have expressed interest in Archer. Neither 
Archer nor his agent, Steve Feldman, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Chargers' current quarterback situation, the coaches will hold their 
breaths and hope Tolliver begins to show signs that he is capable of more than 
he produced in Saturday's exhibition with the Phoenix Cardinals. In 24 plays he 
completed seven of 16 passes and threw two interceptions. Among them, the three 
remaining Charger quarterbacks have started seven games, which is cause for 
concern with the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it is," Henning said. "It's always a concern. When you have concerns you 
consider your alternatives and when you don't think you have real good, viable 
alternatives then you don't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Starting free safety Vencie Glenn ended a 10-day holdout by agreeing to a 
two-year contract and returning to camp in time to practice Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn, who has started 51 consecutive games for the Chargers, said he killed 
time during his holdout by playing golf and "sitting around and waiting." 
</P>
<P>
"It gets kind of frustrating because you don't know what's going to happen day 
to day," he said. "The main thing you've got to do is stay positive." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's arrival reduced the holdout list to two: defensive end Leslie O'Neal 
and Junior Seau, the Chargers' first-round draft selection. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard met with Seau and his agent, Steve Feldman, Monday morning and Feldman 
made a new proposal, which Beathard said is still well above what the Chargers 
are prepared to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a pleasant meeting, but frustrating in a way because I think Junior is 
frustrated," Beathard said. "It's difficult for a young player to be directly 
involved in this because Junior wants to be here and Junior wants to be on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
To keep their roster at the 80-man limit, the Chargers released free agent 
safety Tim Jackson and cornerback Keith Collins, a seventh-round draft choice 
from Appalachian State. Collins is the first draft selection to be released. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Joey Howard is scheduled for arthroscopic knee surgery today and rookie 
guard Chris Goetz will undergo arthroscopic elbow surgery Wednesday. Eric 
Floyd, a second-year tackle from Auburn, will likely take Howard's place in 
practice.

GAVALDON SHOWS TRUE COLORS, WINS

<P>
Angelica Gavaldon came dressed for success. The color-conscious 16-year-old 
from Coronado left the neons at home and opted instead for all-white. 
</P>
<P>
But Gavaldon, who has quickly developed a reputation of being one of the more 
flamboyant dressers on the tour, didn't break with tradition entirely, as a red 
pony-tail holder held her long hair in place. 
</P>
<P>
But the color most conspicuously missing was rookie green. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening match of the Great American Bank Tennis Tournament Monday night, 
Gavaldon played like a seasoned veteran, defeating West Germany's Claudia 
Porwik, 7-5, 6-4, in front of 3,514 at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. 
The victory earned Gavaldon, who turned professional in February, the chance to 
play the second-ranked player in the world, should Martina Navratilova win her 
opening match against Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer at 6:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, despite being down, 4-1, in the first set and, 4-2, in the second, 
never flinched. She simply put on her game face and went to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I was down both sets," she said, "I was very happy to be able to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday's draw, Gavaldon has known Navratilova would be her opponent in 
the second round, if she could get past Porwik. A big if. 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament that thrust her into the public eye, Gavaldon made it to the 
quarterfinals of the Australian Open in January, then was stopped by Porwik. 
Payback was sweet, but Gavaldon isn't wasting time relishing the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my best victory," she said, "but I was happy to get another chance to 
play her. I could have gotten to the semis at the Australian Open if I had beat 
her there." 
</P>
<P>
With her powerful groundstrokes, Gavaldon had Porwik dancing from side to side 
in the backcourt. But on her first match point, Gavaldon double-faulted. Her 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Was it nerves or a bad toss perhaps? Neither, she said. She was looking ahead 
to Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
"On match point that's what I was thinking about," Gavaldon said. "But I'm not 
nervous about playing her. I have nothing to lose. I'm just glad I have an 
opportunity to play her." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Merry, Gavaldon's coach of six years, said this is an important time in 
Gavaldon's career. After a treacherous six-week swing through Europe recently, 
Gavaldon had the opportunity to play five events, some on grass and clay, 
giving her a dose of invaluable experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an eye-opening thing," Merry said. "She needs to play all the Grand 
Slam events and on all surfaces. Now she has that experience. This is an 
important week for her." 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon may still be a new kid on the block, but she still is more of a 
presence than rookie Alysia May, one of two wild-card players in the 
tournament. These are the players who can make the veterans squirm. Ask Manuela 
Maleeva-Fragniere. 
</P>
<P>
May, a former UCLA All-American, turned pro two months ago in Singapore, and 
gave fourth-seeded Maleeva-Fragniere a scare, before Maleeva-Fragniere took the 
match, 6-4, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she played very well," said Maleeva-Fragniere, "not knowing who she is 
and where she's from. I don't know if she can play every day like this." 
</P>
<P>
If, indeed, she can, May's emergence on the pro tour verifies 
Maleeva-Fragniere's view that in today's tournaments, there is no such thing as 
an easy match. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's so good now," she said. "I really think, against the player you 
haven't heard of, you can't afford one mistake, you can't relax for one point." 
</P>
<P>
May was down, 4-1, in the second set before winning four consecutive games to 
take a 5-4 lead. But both players held serve -- Maleeva-Fragniere held twice -- 
to force the tiebreaker, which Maleeva-Fragniere won, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Still, May said she was encouraged by her play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to get some games," she said. "I've never played anyone that 
good. She's ranked ninth in the world, and that's a pretty good showing." 
</P>
<P>
In the day's opening match on center court, Terry Phelps of Larchmont, N.Y., 
dropped the first set, but won the next two easily to upset seventh-seeded 
Gretchen Magers of San Diego, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The first set, she played so well, there was nothing I could do," Phelps said. 
"Then I started getting my volleys in, got more aggressive and she made some 
mistakes. It's hard when you play so well, to keep up that intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said she was able to capitalize on Magers' mental lapse and unforced 
errors to take the second and third sets. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to take it point by point," said Phelps, who lost, 7-6, 6-4, to 
Magers in the finals of a tournament in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1988, the last 
time they met. "There were some signs she was tight and nervous. She semed a 
little angry with herself." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina's Renata Baranski, the 150th ranked player in the world, 
eliminated Sweden's Catarina Lindqvist, a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1989, 0-6, 
6-4, 6-1. Sixth-seeded Barbara Paulus of Austria defeated former San Diego 
State All-American Monique Javer, 6-3, 6-1. . . . Top-ranked Steffi Graf meets 
wild-card entrant Stephanie Rehe of Oceanside at 11 a.m. today. It is Rehe's 
first match since November, 1988, when she was forced to take a year off 
because of back injuries sustained in a car accident.

<P>
Corey Bromberg nearly worked himself into a lather the night before the most 
important start of his young career, for Woodland Hills West in the third round 
of the American Legion state baseball tournament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He tossed. He turned. He buried his head in the pillow. 
</P>
<P>
He then repeated the sequence, thought not necessarily by choice. It seems that 
a few high-spirited teammates tossed and turned him some more late Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Bromberg, in his first year with West, was being officially welcomed to the 
club while sleeping. His teammates held him down and jokingly threatened to 
shave him from head to toe if he didn't win Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Bromberg and West more than pinned down Stockton, 11-1, in a 
game that was called in the bottom of the seventh inning because of the 10-run 
rule. West, 34-6 overall and 3-0 in the double-elimination tournament, has 
automatically qualified for a berth in the regionals on Aug. 15-20 in either 
Union City, Calif., or Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
West plays Escondido (15-3) for the state championship today at 10 a.m. If West 
loses, a second game will be played in the afternoon. A win by West in either 
game would mean a state title, something that eluded the team last season en 
route to its World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
Bromberg (7-1) struck out four, walked none and recorded 18 of the first 19 
outs via fly ball (16) or strikeout (three) Monday. His defense -- particularly 
left fielder Chris Castillo and center fielder Jeff Marks -- repeatedly bailed 
Bromberg out by pulling down an assortment of loopers and liners in the gaps 
and at the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Staked to a 6-0 lead after three innings -- by which time West had banged out 
11 of its 16 hits -- Bromberg reared back and fired. And he came within a 
whisker of the tournament's only shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 10-0, in the top of the seventh, he needed three outs for the game to

<P>
AEROSPACE: GENERAL DYNAMICS WILL LET UP TO 2,000 WORKERS GO. IT ALSO PLANS TO 
CONSOLIDATE UNITS IN POMONA AND RANCHO CUCAMONGA.

General Dynamics said Monday that it will lay off 1,500 to 2,000 workers in the 
Los Angeles area by the end of 1991 and consolidate two divisions in Pomona and 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis-based defense giant blamed the cutbacks on declining defense 
budgets and on the negative effects of a broad Pentagon procurement policy to 
seek second production sources for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Hawes, the firm's executive vice president, said Monday that the company 
may lay off 600 to 1,000 workers by the end of this year but has made no 
decision about closing any of its missile plants. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's Valley Systems division in Rancho Cucamonga employs 3,500, and its 
Pomona division employs 5,700, including 1,600 out of state. Both divisions 
produce tactical missiles. The Pomona division already has laid off 560 workers 
this year and is down from a peak of 8,000 three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear that there is going to be less business out there," Hawes 
said in a telephone interview Monday. "It is really beginning to hit home." 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace downturn overtaking General Dynamics is expected to last at least 
through the mid-1990s, by which point the California economy would have lost an 
estimated 110,000 direct defense jobs, according to economic forecasters 
DRI-McGraw Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, virtually every major prime contractor in Southern California 
has been forced to cut back employment, either because of a drop in business or 
because it wants to flee to lower-cost areas of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft eliminated more than 9,000 jobs last year. Lockheed may cut as 
many as 8,000 jobs over the next few years. McDonnell Douglas is slashing 8,000 
jobs this year. Northrop is trimming 3,000 jobs this year. Only TRW and 
Rockwell International have yet to order sizable layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defense contractor and has 
103,000 employees at facilities stretching from a submarine shipyard in the 
Boston area to a rocket plant in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga are among the firm's smaller 
operations, they have accounted for about half of the corporation's layoffs 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the disproportionate effect is that tactical missile programs 
are being sharply cut back by the Pentagon, even as it seeks to preserve the 
$62.8 billion B-2 Stealth bomber program and other higher cost weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the General Dynamics operations have been severely hurt by a broad 
Pentagon policy in recent years to seek second production sources for its 
weapons. Every major program at the two divisions was slated for second 
sourcing, Hawes noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy selected Raytheon to compete on the Standard missile and General 
Electric to compete on the Phalanx shipboard gun. The Army selected Raytheon to 
compete on the Army Stinger missile. 
</P>
<P>
Now, both Raytheon and General Electric are behind schedule in learning how to 
build those systems and have yet to be "certified" for production, even though 
the Pentagon is continuing to award contracts to the firms, Hawes charged. 
</P>
<P>
"They are both substantially late in getting qualified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even though the Pentagon has a new policy of curtailing second source 
competitions, it can not terminate the General Dynamics competitions until the 
second sources have been qualified so they can compete for a final buyout of 
production, Hawes charged. 
</P>
<P>
"From a business point of view, you have to question the sanity of it," Hawes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hawes said, General Dynamics is now attempting to cut its costs so 
it can eventually win the future competitions, assuming the competition learns 
how to build the products. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics said about 600 of the 1,500 to 2,000 due to be eliminated will 
come from reducing duplication once the divisions are combined. 
</P>
<P>
When General Dynamics decided to open the Rancho Cucamonga operation in 1985 in 
the heyday of the Reagan Administration defense buildup, it was to relieve the 
growth at the Pomona operation. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon decision to seek second sources left General Dynamics with 
excess factory capacity, since it would have to share production. In Phalanx 
guns, for example, General Dynamics tooled up for production of 10 systems per 
month, but under dual sourcing production is likely to be two or three per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the company will eliminate surplus factory space. Though 
Hawes expressed the sort of dissatisfaction with the California business 
climate that is now commonplace in the industry, he ruled out a total closure 
of the California facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any immediate plans for a wholesale move out of California, but I 
would certainly have to say that the trend is to move out of California on a 
long-term basis," Hawes said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the firm has invested tremendously in its Pomona plant over the 
years. In addition, it is partly owned by the Navy, which helps lower costs. 
The Rancho Cucamonga plant is owned by General Dynamics. The two divisions also 
operate plants in Camden, Ark., and on a Navajo Indian Reservation. Hawes said 
the company recently opened a small plant in the Imperial Valley, where wages 
are lower, to see if it can continue to do business in California at all. So 
far, 100 workers are located at the facility.

THE FEAR FACTOR; 
</P>
<P>
MARKET'S ORDERLY DECLINE MAY CREATE FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Amid the stock market's continuing slide, many Wall Streeters are expressing 
satisfaction with the "circuit breakers" that seem to be slowing the decline. 
</P>
<P>
But that's raising a difficult question: Would it be better just to let the 
market find its own level -- as quickly as possible -- rather than artificially 
stretch out the plunge? 
</P>
<P>
Noting a lack of panic in the market, despite the severity of stocks' losses so 
far, some analysts fear that institutional investors are lulling themselves 
into a false sense of security. True panic selling, unencumbered by circuit 
breakers, might finally wash out the fear in the market and allow it to 
stabilize at levels that reflect the new economic reality, some argue. 
</P>
<P>
"One argument against circuit breakers is that maybe prices should be lower, 
and you want to get there quickly," says Tyler Cowen, associate professor of 
economics at George Mason University's Center for the Study of Market Processes 
in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that circuit breakers could artificially create a panic selling 
situation: As stocks fall near a level that would trigger a circuit breaker, 
investors may begin dumping for fear that they won't be able to sell later. 
</P>
<P>
So far, circuit breakers on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, where stock index futures are traded, have achieved the 
desired effect, those exchanges say: 
</P>
<P>
* On the NYSE, index arbitrage program trading has been all but suspended after 
the Dow Jones industrial index has fallen 50 points. That has removed 
considerable selling pressure, even though the Dow has gone on to close down 
54.95 points last Friday and 93.31 points on Monday. NYSE Vice President 
Richard Torrenzano on Monday called the circuit breaker "very effective." 
</P>
<P>
* On the Chicago Merc, a circuit breaker that halts selling when the Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500-stock index futures contract falls 12 points seems to have 
braked selling across both futures and stock markets. After dropping the 
12-point limit Monday, selling at a lower price was banned for 30 minutes. In 
the interim, buyers surfaced and the contract rebounded by midday, though it 
fell again by the close. 
</P>
<P>
Besides their use in program trading, S&amp;P futures often are used as a proxy 
for actual stocks, when traders simply want to bet on a market decline. Either 
way, futures -- and futures circuit breakers -- can set the tone for the stock 
market. Thus, analysts say it isn't a coincidence that the Dow seemed to hold 
just above the minus-100 level for much of Monday: The 12-point S&amp;P circuit 
breaker is the equivalent of about a 100-point fall in the Dow, around 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many experts agree that stock prices are likely to drop much lower in the 
near term, given the potential for a U.S.-Iraq war and for a global economic 
recession as oil prices jump. In many nations without market circuit breakers, 
stocks suffered far greater declines Monday than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Would it be better just to allow the selling to reach a crescendo -- like the 
508-point, 22.6% plunge in the Dow on Oct. 19, 1987, before circuit breakers 
were introduced -- than to prop up stocks artificially? 
</P>
<P>
California State Treasurer Thomas Hayes, who sat on the blue-ribbon NYSE panel 
that studied market volatility after the 1987 crash, says the benefit of 
circuit breakers is simply that "they give people time to think." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes says he didn't support the concept of circuit breakers initially. "I took 
some real convincing, because I consider myself a free marketeer," he says. But 
talks with investors who lived through the 1987 crash swayed him. 
</P>
<P>
Investors felt that events happened far too fast to allow any rational 
decision-making in the 1987 crash, Hayes says. Circuit breakers at least 
provide some breathing room. Yet such limits don't interfere with the long-term 
market process, because "eventually the market will find its own level," Hayes 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Cutler, editor of the Market Mania newsletter in Pacifica, agrees that a 
daily Dow drop of 80 to 90 points is preferable to a sudden 500-point loss. "It 
at least gives investors the opportunity to review the situation daily." 
</P>
<P>
But Cutler also admits that the circuit breakers that restrain blue-chip 
selling are misleading because "they only limit the area that is the emotional 
trigger," meaning the Dow stocks. 
</P>
<P>
By limiting the damage in those visible stocks, more money managers may be 
encouraged to remain complacent about the market decline. Meanwhile, the rest 
of the market is suffering far worse. Monday, for example, while the S&amp;P 
500 index lost 3.0%, the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite suffered a 4.2% hit. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Baxter, president of Jefferies &amp; Co., a Los Angeles brokerage that 
specializes in institutional trading, says that while many investors may be 
heartened by the market's seemingly orderly decline, "there really hasn't been 
any buying support."

<P>
Oil prices reached their highest levels in five years Monday and gasoline 
prices continued to spurt upward as uncertainty in the wake of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait fueled fears of shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Prices could go as high as $40 or $50 per barrel if a worldwide embargo 
succeeds in eliminating Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil from world supplies, analysts 
added. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract price of the 
benchmark U.S. crude oil grade, West Texas Intermediate, continued its 
stratospheric climb, closing Monday at $28.05 a barrel, up $3.56. 
</P>
<P>
It brought the price of the crude grade to near its all-time high of $30.15, 
reached in 1984 during the Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices are moving further and faster than any of us have given them credit," 
said Peter Beutel, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. 
</P>
<P>
At the gasoline pump, the average cost of self-serve unleaded gasoline jumped 
7.1 cents per gallon over the weekend, the American Automobile Assn. said 
Monday. In California, some areas reported price increases of 12 to 15 cents 
per gallon, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
The increases were the fastest since those in the two-week period following the 
March, 1989, oil spill in Alaska, when prices rose nearly 12 cents a gallon, 
the association said. 
</P>
<P>
The AAA's Fuel Gauge Report, which is based on a spot check of 1,400 service 
stations around the nation, showed self-serve unleaded gasoline averaging 
$1.186 per gallon nationally, up from $1.115 on Friday and $1.075 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The price hikes were driven largely by fear and market psychology, as well as 
by demand to beef up oil inventories, even though current stocks of oil remain 
ample, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices could go even higher if real shortages develop as feared. Experts say 
prices easily could peak at $40 to $50 a barrel before demand would fall 
sharply. An increase of oil prices to $40 per barrel could boost the price of 
gasoline by 25 to 60 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
All guesses would go out the window if a shooting war breaks out in the Persian 
Gulf, or if Iraq invades Saudi Arabia. "You'd be in uncharted waters," said one 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
Shortages could develop under the move by virtually all major consuming nations 
-- and a vote Monday by the U.N. Security Council -- to bar imports of Iraqi 
oil. If strictly enforced, a worldwide embargo would eliminate from world 
supplies Iraq and Kuwait's combined oil production of 4 million to 5 million 
barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
That likely would push up prices to $30 per barrel in the next two or three 
weeks, barring some action to counteract the shortfall. Gasoline prices could 
be expected to follow, increasing by 2 to 5 cents per gallon for every $1 per 
barrel increase in crude. 
</P>
<P>
Such an embargo would likely require a military blockade of Iraqi ports and 
pipelines that cross Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo is already having an effect: Iraq shut down one of its twin oil 
pipelines running through Turkey to the Mediterranean on Monday, and curtailed 
flow through the other, in the face of dwindling demand for its oil. 
</P>
<P>
Price shocks would be dampened if other oil producing countries take up the 
slack. But the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly newsletter, reported that 
current excess capacity by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries amounted to only 3.5 million barrels of oil a day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush so far seems unwilling to tap the United States' 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, whose 590 million barrels would provide 3.5 
million barrels a day of oil for about 170 days. Energy Department officials 
said over the weekend that the SPR was not intended to be a "pricing 
mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, experts said, would go off the chart if Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein invades Saudi Arabia, provoking a military response from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Picture a car speeding along at 65 m.p.h. in a foggy tunnel, where you know 
there's a brick wall ahead of you somewhere, but you just aren't sure where," 
Beutel said. "That's what we're dealing with."

Oil price -- A story in Tuesday's Business section incorrectly stated the 
all-time high price for crude oil. Crude oil futures prices reached their peak 
at $32.35 a barrel on Aug. 2, 1983, in trading on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, the exchange reported. On the cash market, West Texas Intermediate, 
the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil, peaked at $39.80 a barrel on March 29, 
1980, according to Peter Beutel, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures.

The dollar fell against most major currencies Monday, despite a clear risk of 
military conflict in the Middle East. And that is both unusual and a potent 
indicator of present and future economic events, financial experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the dollar is a "safe haven" currency, bought heavily by foreigners in 
times of high tension. But in this crisis it has been bought tepidly. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar has been abysmal," remarks Allen Sinai, chief economist of Boston 
Co. It gained only slightly last week following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and 
fell on Monday despite a worsening of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
That sent a signal to financial markets. "I think the dollar is losing some of 
its safe haven status," said a London currency dealer. "People are focusing on 
the fundamental weaknesses in the U.S. economy." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the belief among global investors that with the U.S. 
economy teetering close to recession, the Federal Reserve will lower interest 
rates -- which would make U.S. government bonds less attractive to foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's more than a matter of interest rates. World markets are focusing 
on what is perceived to be weaknesses in the American character, says a global 
money manager. And it is that focus that offers financial markets a forecast of 
what's ahead for the U.S. economy, and explains much of what is happening 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of international money markets -- where multinational businesses, 
banks and individuals trade currencies around the clock -- the United States is 
regarded as having abandoned the dollar's value in recent years because it has 
borrowed from abroad to fund the U.S. government deficit, and run a huge trade 
deficit because it refused to curb domestic consumption. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the United States has flooded the world with dollars, and their 
value has declined almost 40% against both the German mark and the Japanese yen 
-- meaning that the purchasing power of a dollar in Germany or Japan is now 
only 60% of what it was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This has been devastating for the oil producers -- because oil is bought and 
sold in dollars. So members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries -- be they Arab or Venezuelan, Indonesian or Nigerian -- have seen 
their oil revenue purchase less in machinery or consumer goods from Germany or 
Japan, or France or Britain. With the dollar worth 20% less in German marks 
than a year ago, even Volkswagens are expensive -- not to mention Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
That declining purchasing power made oil producers restive, and that opened a 
door for Iraq's empire-building President Saddam Hussein. To be sure, dollar 
depreciation doesn't explain, much less excuse, Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. But 
dissatisfied oil producers backed Hussein in OPEC councils; they wanted to hit 
back at the United States. Hussein played on those emotions. 
</P>
<P>
But Hussein may be a passing problem; with the world united against his 
aggression, he may not even survive as leader of Iraq. But oil and the dollar 
will continue to be a problem, say analysts. No doubt the price of oil will be 
higher than it was before the crisis -- OPEC had already voted to increase the 
price to $21 a barrel from $18. 
</P>
<P>
More important, say analysts, the OPEC producers may try to prevent future 
erosion of their purchasing power, perhaps by denominating oil in several 
currencies. They would then be able to demand payment in marks or yen or 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And that would be disadvantageous for the U.S. economy. "Fewer countries would 
have to acquire or keep dollars to pay for their oil, and so the dollar's value 
would fall," explains economist Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he adds, that is already happening as the markets buy the mark and 
sell the dollar. (The yen has been weak also in this crisis because of Japan's 
total dependence on imported oil; but Japan's economy is regarded as strong, 
and it may attract the global investment the lagging U.S. economy may lose.) 
</P>
<P>
The logical conclusion, say analysts, is that the Federal Reserve will have to 
keep interest rates high to "defend" the dollar. Otherwise, a falling dollar -- 
which could help exports -- would also bring higher inflation in a country that 
imports half its oil and which owes so much abroad after years of borrowing. 
"The accumulated budget deficits at the federal and state levels limit our 
alternatives," says Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that the U.S. economy is in a difficult position, needing high 
interest rates to curb inflation but low interest rates to avoid recession. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any way out? Well, the United States might hope to carry on borrowing 
from abroad, counting on the world's gratitude for putting its military on the 
line in the Middle East to protect international oil supplies. But the 
battering of the dollar shows what the cold, calculating world thinks of that 
hope.

COPPOLA TO RESHOOT PORTIONS OF 'GODFATHER, PART III' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After spending $55 million and six months behind the camera, director Francis 
Ford Coppola will return to Italy to reshoot portions of his upcoming epic, 
"The Godfather, Part III," according to sources close to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 million in reshoots -- one week in Sicily in early September, followed 
by one week in New York, and involving stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton -- will 
boost the cost of the troubled production to more than $60 million, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola has said that the film was budgeted at $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures President Sidney Ganis denied that there were problems with 
the movie. He said "any costs associated (with the reshoots) were absolutely, 
unequivocally budgeted" and involve "no major material whatsoever, only 
incidental scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Both Paramount and Coppola have a lot riding on the much-heralded project. The 
first two "Godfather" movies -- released in 1972 and 1974 -- together grossed 
more than $700 million at theaters and earned another $100 million in TV and 
video sales. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, which has lost its historical dominance at the box office, could use 
another artistic and commercial success of that magnitude. The studio has been 
trying to get "Godfather III" off the ground since 1974, when the first sequel 
to Coppola's epic became a smash box-office hit and earned an Academy Award for 
best picture. 
</P>
<P>
For Coppola, "Godfather III" is a chance to revive his sagging reputation as 
one of the country's premier filmmakers and to pay off debts that forced him to 
put his Zoetrope Productions into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He is being 
paid $6 million to direct the film, sources close to the project say.

Eastern Airlines and eight of its managers Monday pleaded not guilty to federal 
charges that they intimidated mechanics into doctoring records to falsely show 
that scheduled repairs on Eastern aircraft were made. 
</P>
<P>
The bankrupt unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and the employees 
entered their pleas before U.S. District Court Judge I. Leo Glasser in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
In a 60-count indictment announced July 25, the defendants were charged with 
conspiring to defraud the government, wire fraud, falsification of documents 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, including Edward Upton, former vice president of maintenance 
and engineering, and Thomas Lewis, Eastern's maintenance director for the 
Washington-to-Montreal region, were charged after a 10-month grand jury 
investigation of the troubled carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that the defendants did not perform required maintenance 
work on Eastern aircraft, and then conspired from July, 1985, to October, 1989, 
to falsify records to show that the work had been completed to avoid flight 
delays and cancellations.

Two Los Angeles brokerage executives who cooperated with prosecutors in 
securities cases stemming from the Ivan F. Boesky insider trading scandals, 
settled administrative charges with federal regulators Monday. 
</P>
<P>
James T. Melton, who testified for the government at the GAF Corp. stock 
manipulation trial, and Michael Z. Landy, a government witness against takeover 
strategist Paul Bilzerian, settled actions brought by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Both men, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to a six-month ban 
from dealing in the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
Melton, 47, a former director of trading for Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; 
Co., testified at two of the three trials of GAF and its vice chairman, James 
Sherwin. They were accused of plotting to drive up the price of Union Carbide 
stock after a failed GAF takeover attempt of the Danbury, Conn.-based chemical 
maker. The case ended in a mistrial twice before a guilty verdict in December, 
1989.

DOLLAR MANAGES GAIN AGAINST ONLY THE YEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dollar ended higher against the Japanese yen but lower against other major 
currencies as its status as in times of turmoil seemed to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
As oil prices soared and the stock market experienced its worst one-day drop 
since last October's "mini-crash," the U.S. currency managed a modest gain only 
against the yen, because Japan is expected to suffer severely from the Mideast 
oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended at 150.35 yen, compared to 149.25 at Friday's close. But 
against the German currency, which has been trading near its postwar highs 
against the dollar, the U.S. currency sank to 1.5760 German marks from 1.5850 
on Friday. The dollar's historical low against the mark is 1.56, set in 
January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar is likely to fall more easily than rise," said Marc Chandler of 
Money Market Services. "For the dollar, the downside is the path of least 
resistance." 
</P>
<P>
"The flight to quality is now in European currencies," said one dealer. "The 
U.S. is dependent on imported oil and is under recessionary pressures from 
rising oil prices. The only thing that could help the dollar is if the stock 
market turns around at the 2,700 level." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the yen remained weak. "Among all major currencies, the yen is the 
weakest because of the perception that Japan's economy will suffer from the 
rising oil prices," said Ravi Bulchandani of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Japan imports virtually all of its oil. 
</P>
<P>
The rally in oil prices boosted the British pound because Britain is a net 
exporter of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The pound rose to $1.8730 from $1.8600 at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Gold Futures Get Lift From Tensions 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices climbed strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
reflecting growing fears that the soaring price of crude oil will lead to 
higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures rose to their highest levels in more than 4 1/2 years as Iraq 
and the United States appeared to be headed for a showdown over Iraqi 
aggression in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures rose, and livestock and 
meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $7.30 to $7.80 higher in New York, with the contract for 
delivery in August at $384.70 an ounce; silver ended 5 to 5.7 cents higher, 
with September at $4.92 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by sharp 
gains in corn and soybeans as the surging crude oil and gold markets stoked 
inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
Crude's gains also sparked speculation that the Soviet Union, which exports oil 
to European countries, might soon have more money to spend on grain imports, 
said Joel Karlin, a grain market analyst with Research Department Inc. in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Karlin said unseasonably cool overnight temperatures in the Midwest revived 
concerns about the possibility of early frost damage to late-planted soybeans, 
which added further support.

INFLATION FEARS POUND BOND PRICES LOWER

Bond prices took another drubbing Monday amid rising fears of bonds' most 
dreaded enemy, inflation. 
</P>
<P>
As investors worried that the Persian Gulf crisis would drive up oil prices, 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slumped 2-19/32 points, or $25.94 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield soared to 8.80% from 8.56% on Friday. Bond 
yields rise as bond prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many ways this Kuwait crisis could end, but almost every one 
involves higher-price oil," said Kevin Flanagan, economist at Dean Witter 
Reynolds. "They're feeling the implications in every corner of the market." 
</P>
<P>
Also troubling to investors was the prospect of the U.S. Treasury selling 
another $32.25 billion in bonds this week in its quarterly refunding and the 
implications of the unemployment statistics released last Friday. The report 
showed joblessness rising 0.3 percentage points in July. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts recalled the 1979-80 oil crisis, in which some bond buyers 
suffered huge losses as the effects of oil price increases pushed inflation 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
By some measures, the bond market performed worse than the stock market in that 
period. In 1979, for example, the Dow Jones industrial index lost 11% of its 
value from the year's high to its low, while the 30-year Treasury bond was off 
12%. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation erodes the value of all bonds, but in particular the bonds with the 
longest maturities, and analysts said investors have been shunning long-term 
instruments in the past three sessions while they await a clearer picture of 
the likely outcome of developments in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
At 8.80%, the 30-year T-bond now is the highest since early May. 
</P>
<P>
Volume in trading of long-term bonds was reported to be very light. Analysts 
said the bond market's decline also in part reflected disappointment that the 
Federal Reserve didn't cut interest rates Monday, as some had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter-term government securities fell 1/8 to 3/4 point, while intermediate 
maturities were off 5/8 to 1-19/32 points, according to Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's auction begins today with the sale of 3-year notes. The 
government will attempt to sell 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on 
Thursday. A key concern is whether foreign investors will be willing to bid for 
the bonds, given the uncertainty in global markets.

3 FIRMS LIMIT GAS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: ARCO, TEXACO AND CHEVRON SAY THEY ARE ENSURING SUPPLY FOR THEIR OWN 
STATIONS. CRITICS SAY THEY ARE STOCKPILING TO PUSH UP PRICES.

<P>
In a move that independent gasoline distributors say could boost gasoline 
prices further, at least three major oil companies have restricted gasoline 
sales to the firms. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield, Texaco and Chevron have limited sales to the distributors, 
the middle men who in turn sell to independent service stations. The 
restrictions have sent the distributors scrambling for alternate gasoline 
sources and prompted further criticism of an industry facing widening charges 
of price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reminder that we're held hostage by the industry and they'll use any 
excuses to raise prices," said Lee Ross, president of the California 
Independent Oil Marketers Assn. "To me, this is strictly a price move that is 
motivated by exploitation." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics contend that the restrictions are a way that oil companies are 
trying to stockpile reserves in anticipation of higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is trying to hold onto supply because it might be worth more 
tomorrow," said consumer advocate Ed Rothschild with Citizen Action in 
Washington. "They're acting as if there's going to be a shortage and are 
creating one." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Wallace, owner of South Bay Petroleum Co., said Arco cut his allocation 
by 250,000 gallons a month, a reduction of 30%. The move is forcing him to find 
new suppliers in a frenzied market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfair cost and expense to these independent business people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arco, the leading gasoline retailer on the West Coast, said it restricted sales 
to independent wholesalers last week to ensure adequate reserves for its 
company stations. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have the capability of taking all of our product if we let them," 
said George Babikian, president of Arco Products Co., Atlantic Richfield's 
refining and marketing division. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to similar restrictions after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, 
Fereidun Fesharaki, an oil market expert at the government-funded East-West 
Center in Honolulu, said other companies likely will follow with restrictions 
similar to those by Arco, Texaco and Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
"Arco usually is the leader in this kind of activity," he said. "I'd be 
surprised if other companies didn't follow." 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions allow oil companies to hedge against uncertainties, Fesharaki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can reduce the commitment at present, you are more flexible as a 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Independent wholesalers supply about 20% of all fuel sold in the United States, 
according to the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Arco said it funnels about 18% of its business through independent 
distributors.

Paul DelPizzo spent the past five years studying for a career in advertising. 
This fall, he is thinking about leaving college -- but not for a job on Madison 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of selling images, DelPizzo may soon be selling pizzas. He is pondering 
an offer to manage an Italian restaurant in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past four months, all I've been thinking about is this decision," said 
DelPizzo, 24, who is a senior majoring in advertising at Cal State Fullerton. 
"My heart says to go with what I've dedicated the last five years of my life 
toward. But my head is saying to go with the financial security now." 
</P>
<P>
For DelPizzo, at least there appears to be an employment option. But for the 
thousands of students who are majoring in advertising at universities 
nationwide, the situation looks pretty dismal. Most advertising agencies are 
laying off -- not hiring. Yet none of this seems to be stopping record numbers 
of students from majoring in advertising. Virtually every college in the nation 
offering a degree in advertising reports that demand is so great that many are 
actually turning away prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly aren't trying to paint a rosy picture," said Fred Zandpour, 
coordinator of the advertising department at Cal State Fullerton, which with 
1,100 advertising majors ranks among the largest in the nation. "The job market 
isn't good. But that doesn't seem to be discouraging anyone." 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 students nationally are expected to graduate with degrees in 
advertising during the next year, according to estimates by academics. But less 
than half of the graduates are expected to find jobs even remotely related to 
the field of advertising. "It defies logic that so many would enroll in a 
degree program when the industry is in the doldrums," said Charles Sharp, a 
West Los Angeles-based headhunter who specializes in placing ad executives. "I 
have no idea where these graduates are going to find jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Professors of advertising echo those words. "The hard facts are, we have many 
more students than there are jobs for," said John P. Jones, chairman of the 
advertising department at Syracuse University, which has seen its enrollment 
double to more than 400 majors during the 1980s. "We try to discourage ad 
majors by telling them how difficult it is to get a job." 
</P>
<P>
But few students are switching majors. Instead, some are just lowering their 
expectations. "I'm not above working in a mail room," said Becka Stair, a 
senior in advertising at Cal State Fullerton, who graduates in December. "I 
have several friends who are working at agencies for free right now just to get 
connections." 
</P>
<P>
Even connections might not be enough these days as the nation's universities 
continue to overflow with advertising majors. Until last year, Michigan State 
University, one of the largest ad schools in the nation, had 1,400 ad majors. 
Last year the East Lansing institution began limiting the number of ad majors 
to 1,000, and it is now turning many away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to relate to 1,000 advertising majors," said Bruce 
VandenBergh, chairman of Michigan State's advertising department. "Back in 
1968, when I majored in advertising at Rutgers, there were just a handful of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Other schools are placing limits too. "We're trying to find ways to restrict 
enrollment in a school that doesn't usually believe in such restrictions," said 
Edward Cundiff, chairman of the advertising department at the University of 
Texas in Austin, which now has nearly 700 ad students. "In the last six years, 
our size has doubled." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Advertising Center, a rigorous trade school that trains 
people for the ad business, has seen its enrollment jump 200% to 1,200 over the 
past five years, said Wayne Mansfield, executive director of the center that 
also has a branch in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for students who graduate this year," said Walter Lubars, 
chairman of the School of Mass Communication at Boston University, which has 
about 450 ad students. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how Kim Rotzoll, head of the University of Illinois advertising 
department, reminds the school's 260 majors where they stand: "I tell them they 
can take all the people who work in the ad business in America and fit them 
into our 80,000-seat football stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Some advertising majors have all but given up on the prospect of landing jobs 
domestically. When he graduates, James McLaine, a 20-year-old junior in 
advertising at Boston University, doesn't expect to find a job at a Boston ad 
firm. Instead, he hopes to find an advertising job abroad. He is arranging for 
an internship later this year at a London agency. "I like the thought of doing 
something creative and still making money at it," said McLaine. "But most of us 
know the market is pretty bad right now, so we're looking at jobs overseas." 
</P>
<P>
That may be exactly the place to look, said Allen Rosenshine, chairman of the 
giant advertising agency BBDO Worldwide. "As advertising becomes more global, 
there's going to be a need for trained people, but not necessarily in local 
markets," said Rosenshine. "I don't know how you can look at the current state 
of world events and think anything else." 
</P>

Olympic Festival Needs Gold Medal Sales Pitch 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Southern Californians attended the Olympics here in 1984. 
But how will they react to a huge competition being held here next year to 
prepare athletes for the 1992 games? 
</P>
<P>
That could depend on advertising. Last week, the Los Angeles agency Ayer Tuttle 
was named the agency to create ads for the U.S. Olympic Festival. The 10-day 
event -- which will feature 4,200 athletes in 37 different sports -- takes 
place in Los Angeles in July, 1991. "I recognize a lot of people will think, 
'Ho-hum, it's the Olympics again,' " said Donna Tuttle, chairman of the agency. 
"That's something we'll have to fight." 
</P>
<P>
The ads will take pains to point out that about 90% of the American athletes 
who win medals at the '92 Olympics will first take part in the festival. The 
agency is not being paid for its efforts -- but if it can pull off a successful 
campaign, it hopes to attract future business from some of the wealthy 
corporate patrons of the games. 
</P>

Making TV Ad, Jackson Was 'Unstoppable' 
</P>
<P>
What went into Michael Jackson's newest commercial, "Unstoppable Magic" for 
L.A. Gear? 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Jackson's time, according to Sandy Saemann, executive vice president 
at L.A. Gear. "I spent over 90 hours with him in seven days," said Saemann of 
the ad to debut this week. "No one else would have gone this far but Michael." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson oversaw all the sound effects for the ad -- and also played a major 
role editing and directing it, Saemann said. The sound effects, which Jackson 
is said to have spent nearly 17 hours producing, are mostly late-night street 
sounds set to a rhythmic beat. 
</P>

Fruit, Cereal Ads May Be Coming in Bunches 
</P>
<P>
Next time you're slicing a banana on your morning cereal, you may find yourself 
caught in an odd dilemma. Which ad should you read first: the one on the cereal 
box -- or one stuck on the banana? 
</P>
<P>
It all began years ago with product-name stickers that said "Chiquita" or 
"Dole" or "Del Monte." But now, bananas are becoming increasingly popular as 
advertising mediums -- especially by cereal makers. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, for example, currently has ads for Fruit Muesli cereal stuck on its 
bunches. "This happens every summer when banana sales slow down," said Dan 
Edmeier, product distribution manager at Dole Fresh Fruit in Laguna Hills. 
Generally, the cereal makers and fruit companies split the costs of the 
cross-promotions that often include newspaper ads and coupons. No word yet 
about sticking ads inside the bananas. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Blue Line Advertising: Frequent Flyers Only 
</P>
<P>
Folks riding the Blue Line light rail from Long Beach to Los Angeles have 
probably noticed there are no advertisements on the trains -- or at the 
stations. But that might change. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year, RTD officers will "look at revenue possibilities," 
including the placement of ads inside the trains and outside at the stations, 
said Rick Jager, a spokesman for RTD. But there is an "unwritten policy" 
prohibiting ads on the outside of the trains, he said. In the meantime, several 
advertisers -- including Church's Fried Chicken -- have found a way to get an 
early start: They place flyers under windshield wipers of cars parked at the 
Blue Line parking lots. Said RTD's Jager, "We have no policy that prohibits 
that."

UNSOLD HOUSES, CONDOS REACH FOUR-YEAR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inventory of unsold new housing in San Diego County has reached the highest 
level in four years, an indication that sales at subdivisions and condominium 
developments have slowed significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Unsold houses and condos in the county totaled 3,265 units as of June 30, more 
than double the 1,557 units sitting unsold a year previous, according to Market 
Profiles of San Diego, a housing market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Although still far fewer than the record number of 6,768 unsold housing units 
in the county in September, 1981, the total is still the highest in four years, 
Market Profiles President Russell Valone said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Having many unsold units can prove disastrous to all but the financially 
strongest housing developers because of the large investment and high cost of 
financing that go into subdivisions. Several San Diego County developers went 
broke in the early 1980s when the recession caught them holding units they were 
unable to sell. 
</P>
<P>
A growing inventory of unsold new houses is further evidence that the housing 
market is softening. The total of new houses and condos sold during the three 
months ended June 30 dropped by nearly 50% from the total unit sales over the 
same period last year, according to Market Profiles. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in sales -- and the bulge in unsold inventory -- is attributable 
to high prices that are unaffordable to the bulk of new home buyers, Valone 
said. Growing economic uncertainty is also inhibiting home shoppers, he said, 
adding that more subdivisions are trimming prices and offering inducements such 
as appliances, landscaping and interior decorations in an effort to attract 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a new house in the county for the second quarter of 1990 
increased relatively slightly, to $262,214 from the $255,527 average price for 
the second quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a new condominium sold in the county during the second 
quarter jumped to $187,328, up 40% from $134,602 in the same period last year. 
The increase reflects the successful advance-sales programs of several luxury 
condominium developments in San Diego and La Jolla, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The resale market for housing continued to be flat, according to figures for 
July released Monday by the San Diego Board of Realtors, a trade group that 
represents brokers in San Diego, Chula Vista, La Mesa and El Cajon. Board 
members are involved in roughly half of all existing house and condo 
transactions in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The average price for a resold house in July was $222,591, up 6% from the 
$209,125 of July, 1989, the board said. The median price of a July resale -- 
the price at which half of all houses and condos sold had higher prices and 
half had lower -- was $177,500, just 2% above the July, 1989, median. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages now feature an average interest rate of about 10%, down 
from 10.5% a year ago and down from an average of 10.375% in late June, said 
Dennis Casey, HomeFed Bank's group product manager for retail and wholesale 
services. But the drop in rates has not caused a significant increase in 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in fixed-rate mortgage rates, Casey said, the bulk of buyers 
taking out loans at HomeFed are still taking out variable-rate mortgages, 
mainly because of low initial rates that make it easier for them to qualify for 
a purchase.

SAN DIEGO OFFICE GLUT IS GOOD NEWS FOR TENANTS; 
</P>
<P>
RENTS: BROKERS OFFER BIG DISCOUNTS IN EFFORT TO FILL BUILDINGS, BUT THEY EXPECT 
THE SITUATION TO CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego office market is generally overbuilt, which may be bad news for 
the developers stuck with largely empty buildings but good news for local 
tenants who are being offered big discounts as inducements to sign leases. 
</P>
<P>
But local brokers and developers expect the oversupply to shrink over the 
longer term as construction slows. They attribute the downturn in new building 
to the scarcity and high cost of construction financing and the cautious 
approach that Japanese investors are now taking in buying U.S. real estate. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is no different from most other U.S. metropolitan markets with its 
glut of office buildings, according to Kraig Kristofferson, a broker with 
Coldwell Banker's downtown San Diego office. He said the countywide vacancy 
rate is now about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is worse in suburban markets such as Mission Valley at 24% vacant 
and the University Town Centre area at 29% vacant. Office building owners are 
typically offering discounts of 25% or more on leases to prospective tenants, 
said Dennis Cruzan, a partner in CentreMark, a San Diego-based development 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year, three new downtown office buildings totaling 1 million 
square feet of leaseable space will be completed, an 18% addition to downtown's 
total office square footage, Kristofferson said. But the addition may not 
affect downtown's current 14% vacancy rate as much as one might think because 
the new crop of buildings is already 75% to 80% leased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The supply of available industrial and retail building space in San Diego is 
much less glutted than offices, although leasing of new retail buildings has 
slowed to the point that brokers expect an oversupply to develop in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial and warehouse buildings, countywide, feature an overall vacancy rate 
of 12%, with vacancies much slimmer close to the city's center. Coldwell Banker 
industrial space specialist Bill Haines credits strong job growth and the 
increasingly diverse San Diego economy for the strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
Most completed retail centers in San Diego County are virtually leased up, 
averaging vacancies of 5% to 8%, said Don Moser, a retail space specialist with 
Coldwell Banker's downtown San Diego office. But the figure is somewhat 
misleading: new retail centers now under construction have been slow to attract 
tenants, Moser said. 
</P>
<P>
"The (retail) market place has slowed down significantly, and it's shifted to a 
tenant's market," Moser said. "One of the main themes in the market place is 
that retailers are feeling a lack of confidence in consumer spending. So they 
are taking the same wait-and-see attitude on (leasing) new locations." 
</P>
<P>
Although larger retail tenants are still in the market shopping for prime 
locations, smaller independent retailers have slowed their expansion plans, 
Moser said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is now an overall glut of commercial real estate in the county, 
many local real estate brokers and developers predict the supply of available 
commercial space will shrink dramatically over the next year or two. That's 
because the overall pace of development of new buildings in San Diego has 
slowed considerably in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Several reasons for the slowdown are cited. Probably the largest single factor 
is the wholesale departure of savings and loans from the construction lending 
business, a flight caused by provisions in the S&amp;L rescue bill passed last 
summer that made commercial real estate loans and development less profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Until the S&amp;L crisis forced most of them from the arena, S&amp;Ls financed 
60% to 65% of commercial real estate transactions "one way or the other, 
through joint ventures or mortgage financing or both," said Coldwell Banker's 
Haines. Tighter regulatory requirements have now taken S&amp;Ls out of the 
game, leaving a significant void. 
</P>
<P>
Another dampener in San Diego is the expectation that the city may soon impose 
significant increases in development fees as a way of raising money to help the 
city out of its budgetary crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith, a broker with John Burnham &amp; Co.'s downtown San Diego office 
who specializes in land and industrial properties, said one city proposal would 
boost fees to an average cost to the developer of $12 per square foot developed 
from the current $3 per square foot. If passed, the fee increase would make 
many projects now being planned economically unviable. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of developers within San Diego are holding off on new projects to see if 
there will be any increase in building fees. If that's the case, there may not 
be any development taking place. It will flat put a lot of developers out of 
business," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristofferson said another factor in the building slowdown is that Japanese 
investors and lenders are not as eager to invest in San Diego projects as in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest rates in Japan have risen to where there isn't the spread between 
rates there and (interest rates) in the U.S. So there is less inducement to 
make loans over here," Kristofferson said. "They are not as aggressive as they 
have been."

Like most motorists around the country, San Diegans are already paying more at 
the gas pump because of recent events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a state gasoline tax increase of 5 cents a gallon that went into 
effect Wednesday, retail gasoline prices rose again Friday an average 5 cents a 
gallon as a result of market reactions to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, said 
Mary Ann Barngrover, a Chevron USA spokeswoman in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast wholesale spot prices rose another 8 cents a gallon Monday, a jump 
that is likely to translate soon into further price increases at the pumps, 
industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
However, San Diego's overall economy may suffer less than those of most other 
major cities because the area is not a heavy industrial center, nor is it a 
major transportation hub. Moreover, electric rates will probably not increase 
over the next year because of the climb in oil prices, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Max Schetter, senior vice president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce, said most San Diego companies do not rely heavily on oil to generate 
power and therefore are not hit as hard by price increases. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has mainly smaller companies that run on electricity," Schetter 
said.

based in Chula Vista, said Rohr does not use oil to generate power in its area 
plant. The company is a heavy user of electricity, and is concerned about oil 
prices mainly in how they affect electric rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not dependent on oil, and the price of it is not going to impact us at 
this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for San Diego businesses, local electric rates will probably be 
more stable than oil prices. Because San Diego gets its electricity from a 
variety of sources, including about 50% from the San Onofre Nuclear Power 
Plant, increases in oil prices do not necessarily result in a comparable 
increase in electric rates, said Jim Nugent, fuel manager for San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
An SDG&amp;E purchase of 285,000 barrels of oil shortly before the latest 
Mideast crisis will also help prevent rate increases, he said. The company 
supplements its outside sources of power with electricity from its own plants 
that mainly burn natural gas in the summer and oil in the winter, Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
The company saved millions of dollars by buying the oil for $14.65 a barrel 
last month, about $9.50 a barrel less than Monday's price, Nugent said. 
SDG&amp;E has a 1.6-million-barrel reserve, enough to last the utility through 
an average winter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is in good shape for the winter," Nugent said. "Fortunately, we 
bought those barrels and got them about two weeks ago, so we're not in the oil 
market currently." 
</P>
<P>
David Kusumoto, an SDG&amp;E spokesman, said it is difficult to predict how 
electric rates would have been affected if the company had not made the bargain 
purchase, because electricity demand and the cost of other sources of power are 
also big variables. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there would be upward pressure," Kusumoto said. "But it would not 
necessarily be reflected in a customer's bills because of all the other factors 
that go into a person's electric bill." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, one of San Diego County's biggest users of petroleum products, also 
appears to have sufficient supplies of fuel. Naval Supply Center spokeswoman 
Mary Markovinovic said that, although the amount of fuel in the Navy's Point 
Loma storage tanks is classified information, the crisis has not affected the 
Navy's use of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now there are no indications that we will have to cut back on training 
operations or other activities here," Markovinovic said. "We have not gotten 
any word on that." 
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of 1.1 million barrels, the Navy's Point Loma storage tanks are 
the main Southern California military supply center, she said. Between 5 
million and 6 million gallons of diesel, ship and jet fuel were distributed 
from San Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
If an increase in fuel prices forces the Navy to cut back on its fuel use, it 
is unclear how San Diego operations will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone in the Pentagon is going to have to make a decision on where the fuel 
money is going to go," Markovinovic said. "It may be that they'll cut back 
somewhere else or in local operations, but we don't know that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Schetter of the Chamber of Commerce said another reason San Diego is less 
affected by oil prices than similar-size cities is that few major trucking 
operations are based here. San Diego "is not a hub, just a destination or 
origination market" because it is not centrally located, Schetter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that many wholesale trucking firms compared to Los Angeles, San 
Francisco or other cities of similar size," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the most recent year for which figures are available, San Diego was 
the 19th-largest county in the nation, but ranked 59th among metropolitan areas 
for motor freight transportation and warehousing revenues, Schetter said. 
</P>
<P>
Managers of local trucking firms varied in their reaction to the recent oil 
price increases. Bob Neal, manager of Bill Signs Trucking in El Cajon, said a 
5-cent increase in fuel prices translates into an operating increase of about 
$5 per truck a day, a relatively minor expense. The company owns 10 trucks and 
specializes in construction and industrial equipment moving. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, it really doesn't make a significant difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But not all area trucking companies can absorb the increases so easily. Rose 
Pullaro, president of A.R.O. Trucking, said higher fuel prices could drive her 
three-truck company out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of fuel is killing me," she said. "Right now, it's week to week. . . 
. When you don't have a lot of cash flow, when you're not big, I think it hits 
smaller people like me more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do. I may have to close the doors. I don't want 
to. It's my life, but it's one thing after another."

JOE MORGAN'S SUIT PROTESTS DRUG 'PROFILE'; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: THE FORMER BASEBALL STAR SAYS HE WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED BY POLICE 
AND ARRESTED AT LAX BECAUSE HE IS BLACK. A SECOND TRIAL ON HIS CLAIM IS SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, 
police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for 
the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
When Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn 
abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police 
detective moved in quickly to question him. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men 
toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his suspect and pulled 
him to his feet. Placing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then 
marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby. 
</P>
<P>
Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration 
realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that March day in 
1988 was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted 
Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Morgan, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball 
broadcaster, is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court, 
claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain 
"profile" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was 
because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by," said 
William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug 
courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any 
drug activity," said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police 
officer who specializes in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of 
behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to 
transport narcotics. Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying 
for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage 
and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and 
question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers. But the court 
said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what 
the profile is I cannot tell you," said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. 
William Booth. "It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism. 
It's based on trying to protect the public." He said that last year, 254 
narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. Through Aug. 
3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that 
his agency uses drug courier profiles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people 
involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is 
scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles. Morgan is 
seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case. But two months 
later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after 
ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally 
detained by police. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal," the 
judge concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA 
agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that this hadn't happened," Searle said. "I wish (Morgan) luck now that 
I know who he is. I just hope I never see him again." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan could not be reached for comment. But in court documents, he said that 
on March 15, 1988, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a 
connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently 
making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was 
in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him 
retrieve it. When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- 
recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that 
Searle warned the man to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the 
floor. Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his back, wrenched his arms 
behind him and handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, 
but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. Searle 
then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's 
lawsuit. Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar 
incidents from occurring, his attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person 
who uses Los Angeles airport," said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also 
is black. "If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to 
any other black person." 
</P>
<P>
Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss 
specifics of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a 
good announcer," Searle said. "I wish it didn't happen. He just sort of went 
out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police 
Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to 
identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities 
and slapping the officer. 
</P>
<P>
"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted," Lewis said. "If he had 
cooperated, none of this would have happened. I think he had a bruised ego, and 
he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him." 
</P>
<P>
According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and 
Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had 
arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. They said he was using an 
alias. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they 
discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began 
looking for his companion. Since the passenger was black and indicated that his 
companion "looked like me," the officer began looking for a black man who was 
nervous-looking or having "other characteristics of a narcotics courier." 
</P>
<P>
When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan 
started screaming profanities and "making animal noises" and hit him in the 
chest with a wild swing. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered "acute physical 
and emotional distress and embarrassment" after the incident and expressed 
concern about damage to his reputation.

ALLEGED CONFESSION IN MENENDEZ CASE RULED ADMISSIBLE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE JUDGE SAYS A THERAPIST'S AUDIOTAPE OF SESSIONS WITH THE BROTHERS IS 
NOT PROTECTED BY DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In a major victory for prosecutors, a judge ruled Monday that a psychologist's 
audiotapes on which two Beverly Hills brothers allegedly confessed to the 
murders of their wealthy parents may be used as evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have ruled that none of the communications are privileged," Santa Monica 
Superior Court Judge James Albracht announced after a series of closed-door 
hearings that stretched over several months. 
</P>
<P>
He found that psychologist Jerome Oziel had "reasonable cause to believe" that 
Lyle Menendez, 22, and his brother, Erik, 19, "constituted a threat and it was 
necessary to disclose those communications to prevent a danger." 
</P>
<P>
Communications between a therapist and his patient are usually considered 
confidential, unless they involve threats or have been disclosed to a third 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, citing the importance of the issue, immediately said they 
would appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, while calling the ruling important, said it broke no new legal 
ground. Albracht's decision releases the tapes to the district attorney's 
office -- which has already heard them -- and clears the way for their eventual 
use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes, which include conversations and one actual psychotherapy session 
during a six-week period last fall, are considered key evidence against the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"They concern the brothers' emotional and psychological state after the murder 
of their parents," Albracht said of the taped sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were arrested in March in the 1989 shooting deaths of Jose and 
Kitty Menendez. Jose Menendez, a Cuban immigrant, was chief executive of Live 
Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a video and music distributor, a subsidiary of 
Carolco Pictures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not explain the legal basis for his ruling and said he would seal 
both his written opinion and the tapes until Aug. 15 to give defense attorneys 
time to seek an appeals court order. If the higher court agrees to hear the 
matter, local proceedings against the brothers could be delayed for months. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said they will take their appeal to the state Supreme Court, 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always said that this is too important an issue not to be decided at a 
higher level," said attorney Leslie Abramson. "It brings a virtual end to the 
patient-psychotherapist privilege as we understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Both Abramson and co-counsel Gerald Chaleff said that the right to 
confidentiality belongs to the patient and should not be trampled by a 
"talkative" therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Albracht's decision, Abramson said, "treats the privilege as if it's secret 
keeping. . . . The therapist cannot simply be a gossip or a liar -- which we 
are contending in this case -- to make the privilege disappear," she said. "In 
my opinion, Dr. Oziel was less than credible with this court." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the hearings on the issue were exceptionally complex and all 
parties involved "vigorously represented their side." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors -- who opposed Oziel's claim that the tapes belong to him and 
should not be used -- were barred from being present during testimony or 
argument on the matter, although they submitted briefs and position papers. 
Reporters and the public also were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff said Monday's decision breaks no new legal 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts were clear and there was sufficient law," the prosecutor said. "The 
ruling is important, though, because of the procedures used to make the 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
Just what procedures he was referring to is not known, since the hearings took 
place behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly does assist us in the prosecution of the case," Alhadeff said. 
"We do intend to introduce the tapes at the preliminary hearing." 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutor insisted, as he has before, that while "we consider it to be 
very important evidence, it is not crucial to the prosecution's case." 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez brothers showed no reaction to Albracht's ruling, although 
relatives and friends in the courtroom gasped. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, who have pleaded innocent, remain in jail without bail. They 
could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
A date for the brothers' joint preliminary hearing is to be set Monday in 
Beverly Hills Municipal Court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUND BARRIER TO BLOCK LAX NOISE TO BE 
STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo will study the feasibility of installing a sound barrier along 
Imperial Highway to reduce the noise from Los Angeles International Airport, 
which has plagued the city for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airport Commissioners last week allocated $50,000, but no date for 
the start of the study has been set, said Don Harrison, assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain along Imperial is hilly, and Harrison said the city believes that 
an earthen berm or a wall could effectively shield homes in lower-lying 
neighborhoods from the engine noise of aircraft on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Beard, LAX airport noise abatement officer, said a 20-foot-high berm and 
wall combination built several years ago north of the airport has cut noise 
from planes operating on the ground by up to 50% for the first two rows of 
homes near the wall.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN FRIEND'S FATAL 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Cerritos man pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary 
manslaughter Monday afternoon in the shooting death of a friend he was "horsing 
around" with, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Lowenberg is charged in the death of Jason Ford, 17, also of Cerritos, 
who died when a single bullet from a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol struck 
him in the head last Thursday, said Deputy Rich Erickson of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths had been at target practice at a Long Beach shooting range 
before going to Norwalk, where the shooting occurred. Investigators said Ford 
and Lowenberg had been cleaning and playing with Lowenberg's weapon when it 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg was being held at County Jail in Los Angeles Monday in lieu of $5,000 
bail. His preliminary hearing is set for Aug. 16 at the Downey Municipal Court.

CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT BY MRS. BUCKEY DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Monday dismissed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit that Peggy 
McMartin Buckey filed against the county, the city of Manhattan Beach and 
others immediately after her acquittal on molestation charges in the McMartin 
Pre-School case earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged a violation of Buckey's civil rights, but U.S. District Judge 
Richard A. Gadbois Jr., in dismissing the case, said such a claim was "just not 
going to fly." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which also alleged malicious prosecution, conspiracy and defamation, 
sought general damages of $1 million plus additional damages on each count. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you can say these criminal proceedings were without probable 
cause when there was an 18-month preliminary hearing," Gadbois said in a 
hearing Monday. Buckey was acquitted earlier this year after a lengthy trial. 
The judge said he sympathized with Buckey's being upset over her long court 
ordeal, but "being very, very upset does not state a cause of action." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, assistant county counsel Robert Ambrose, who said he was 
pleased with the judge's ruling, added that the U.S. Supreme Court has made it 
clear that just because someone is found not guilty does not give her the right 
to file suit alleging violation of civil rights. Otherwise, he added, the fear 
of liability would impede prosecutors from proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
William Waysman, the attorney representing Peggy McMartin Buckey, admitted that 
civil cases like the one she is pressing are "an uphill battle all the way." 
But Waysman said that, if any case proved the exception to the rule, it would 
be this one. He added that it is "likely" Buckey will appeal Gadbois' decision 
on the civil rights issue and will refile in state court a lawsuit based on the 
other allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants named in the lawsuit were former Dist. Atty. Robert 
Philibosian, Children's Institute International (the child-abuse study center 
where children were interviewed), social worker Kee MacFarlane, former 
television reporter Wayne Satz and his employer, Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 63, and her son, Ray Buckey, were acquitted in January of 52 
molestation charges involving the McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. After 
a retrial that ended last week with a deadlocked jury, eight molestation 
charges against Ray Buckey were dismissed. He immediately filed a civil rights 
suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Several other McMartin defendants, have filed civil suits in state court. While 
these cases have also been dismissed, some have been reinstated by appeals 
courts and others are pending appeal.

STATE TO CUT QUARANTINE ZONE IN WAR ON MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agricultural authorities announced plans Monday to scale back the Mediterranean 
fruit fly quarantine zone in parts of four Southern California counties, while 
a panel of medical experts and residents in Los Angeles complained about the 
effects of the state's recent aerial spraying of malathion, insisting that 
officials ignored the pesticide's potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agriculture officials announced Monday that they would lift the 
quarantine on nearly 20% of the 1,313 square miles in Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties that had been declared off limits for the 
sale and shipment of agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
That decision was tempered by the discovery of a fertile male fly in a peach 
tree in the Orange County community of Brea. Although the area will remain 
under the quarantine as a result of the discovery, state agriculture officials 
said they had no plans to renew the spraying there. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion spraying recently was suspended in the four affected counties. One of 
the world's most destructive agricultural pests, the Medfly attacks 260 
varieties of fruits, vegetables and nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during a special Los Angeles City Council committee hearing called 
by Councilman Joel Wachs, a group of medical experts worried aloud about the 
effects of malathion spraying. The experts, among whom were professors from 
UCLA and USC, suggested that the state may have severely underestimated the 
health effects of the spraying campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The only responsible course of action is to halt the spraying until we have 
reassurances that it is not a health hazard," said Jorge Mancillas, an 
assistant professor at UCLA Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
There was also testimony from Los Angeles spray zone residents whose complaints 
ranged from having flu-like symptoms to one man's insistence that exposure to 
Malathion caused him to suffer temporary blindness. 
</P>
<P>
Offering everything from photographs to neighborhood opinion surveys as proof, 
residents said they have suffered ill health that they directly attribute to 
the malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"They claim we're hysterically reacting, but my reaction is we're hysterically 
being sprayed," said Jean Hinsley Norcott, a resident of an area affected by 
the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo Ulloa, manager of an Alhambra apartment complex, said he has been 
exposed to the spraying three times, getting a dose while cleaning up after the 
nighttime assaults against the Medfly. Since then, Ulloa said, he has suffered 
periods of blindness, dizziness, lack of concentration and other neurological 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
But state and county health officials, who did not attend the hearing, 
reiterated assurances that the spraying does not pose a danger because the dose 
of malathion is extremely small. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've gone the extra mile to study this issue," said James Stratton, 
the state Health Services Department's medical epidemiologist. "There's no 
question that in sufficiently high doses, malathion can be significantly toxic. 
But our position is that the small doses in an aerial program do not pose a 
significant health risk to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs and others at the daylong hearing painted a far bleaker portrait. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of calls and letters from people suffering 
medical problems after malathion spraying," Wachs said before the hearing, held 
by the council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee. "The malathion health 
problem is clearly greater than the state or county officials either know or 
are willing to admit." 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Sadun, an ophthalmology professor at the USC School of Medicine, said a 
small percentage of people can suffer damage to the nerves of their eyes from 
exposure to malathion. More intensive examinations of people who suffer such 
symptoms are needed, he said, to determine any connection. 
</P>
<P>
"The absence of proof in this instance is used as proof that there are no 
problems" from the spraying, Sadun said. "Even if the odds are one in 100,000 
that something will occur, if we spray 1 million people that could mean 10 
people might be blind."

JUDGE RULES SEARCH INVOLVING 2 DEPUTIES IN DRUG CASE IS ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge ruled Monday that evidence obtained in search warrants against 
two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies cannot be used in court, dealing a 
legal setback to government prosecutors in their case against nine narcotics 
officers charged with stealing drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie threw out the evidence against Deputies 
Nancy A. Brown and Michael J. Kaliterna after ruling that authorities lacked 
sufficient cause to search their homes and offices for evidence linking them to 
the money-skimming scandal. Rafeedie said the ruling will stand unless he 
changes his mind in a subsequent written order. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Kaliterna are among nine deputies and a sergeant charged with 
stealing more than $1.4 million from suspected drug dealers and money 
launderers during the last two years. Another 18 narcotics officers have been 
relieved of duties in the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither Brown nor Kaliterna is considered a major figure in the case, 
federal prosecutors opposed Rafeedie's ruling. Government lawyers claimed that 
both deputies had joined other members of their elite narcotics investigations 
team -- known as Majors II -- in a conspiracy to skim money confiscated during 
narcotics raids. 
</P>
<P>
Protesting the judge's ruling, Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann 
contended that both deputies were part of an "ongoing criminal scheme within 
the Majors unit." 
</P>
<P>
The deputies, facing an Oct. 9 trial date, have maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie upheld most of the other warrants served last Sept. 1 -- the day when 
hundreds of FBI agents and sheriff's deputies descended upon deputies' homes, 
offices, cars and other locations during a daylong raid. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, the judge said there was "no probable cause" for investigators 
to have searched property owned by Kaliterna or Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Brown had been with the Majors II crew for only a few months before 
the search warrants were served, Rafeedie said it appeared the deputy had been 
swept up in the investigation "solely based on her membership in this unit." 
</P>
<P>
"That inference alone is not sufficient (for a search warrant)," Rafeedie said. 
</P>
<P>
In its indictment, the federal government claims that Brown was found with 
$13,280 in cash in her possession and Kaliterna had $2,770 in alleged drug 
money when their homes and other property were searched in September. 
</P>
<P>
None of that evidence -- as well as any other material obtained through the 
search warrants -- can now be used against the deputies, if Rafeedie allows his 
ruling to stand. The remaining evidence against the pair is now likely to 
center on the testimony of former Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, their one-time boss who 
has pleaded guilty in the case and has agreed to testify against the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Roger Hansen, who represents Brown, said he hopes the ruling may 
persuade prosecutors to drop their case against his client. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think so," he said, "but that would be up to the government." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Levine, a lawyer who represents Kaliterna, said his happiness over the 
ruling was tempered. "We've won the first battle but won't be satisfied until 
we win the war, until we have total exoneration at trial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hagemann declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rulings on Brown and Kaliterna, prosecutors were victorious in 
spurning efforts by other defendants to quash their search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie upheld search warrants served on Deputies James R. Bauder, Eufrasio G. 
Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, Daniel M. Garner, Macario M. Duran and Duran's wife, 
Maria, who also was indicted in the case. Another indicted deputy, Terrell 
Amers, had his home searched later that same day under a separate warrant. 
Deputy John C. Dickenson agreed to a consent search of his property, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Rafeedie, who will preside over the money-skimming trial, also 
rejected a request by defense attorneys for a hearing to determine whether FBI 
agents and other investigators lied or were negligent in their search warrant 
affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ruled that the videotape of an FBI sting last fall -- 
purportedly showing deputies stealing $48,000 -- can be shown as evidence. 
However, the audio portion, as well as separate audiotapes taken during the 
sting, will not be allowed as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie said that the federal government had missed a legally required 
deadline to seal the tapes as an insurance against possible tampering. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities failed to finish transcribing the tapes, Hagemann told the judge, 
because of its time-consuming investigation. Rafeedie said the fact that 
investigators were too busy to have the tapes sealed was not a satisfactory 
explanation.

MENTAL SERVICES IN PERIL; COUNTY BLAMES STATE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, responding to hundreds of the 
mentally ill and their supporters who packed its hearing room, bitterly 
complained on Monday that the board is being forced to dismantle the county's 
mental health system because of the new state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"This would leave our mental health system in ruins," Supervisor Ed Edelman 
predicted on Monday. "We would really not have a mental health system." 
</P>
<P>
During the first day of the board's budget deliberations, the supervisors came 
up with no solutions to save the network, which was threatened when Gov. George 
Deukmejian made massive cuts in county mental health funds in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, recommended that the 
supervisors add $7 million to the mental health department budget, but that 
would still leave the department with a $39-million deficit in its more than 
$100-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Even under that scenario, many county clinics would be forced to close and tens 
of thousands of people would go untreated. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the impact of the cutbacks was revealed when Roberto Quiroz, director 
of the mental health department, released a detailed list of private mental 
health agencies whose public funding would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health advocates predicted that dozens of these agencies will close, 
causing a loss of care for the homeless, abused children and the chronically 
mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe this," said Richard Van Horn, chief executive officer of the 
Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles County, after he had scanned the list. "This 
is total craziness. You are basically taking the entire mental health system 
and saying to hell with it." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, agency heads huddled around a copy of the list to see how 
they fared. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God!" exclaimed Gladys C. Lee, director of the Asian Pacific Family 
Center in Rosemead, when she read that her agency was being cut by $616,266. 
"This will close our program." 
</P>
<P>
A colleague hugged Lee as she started to cry. The center serves up to 600 Asian 
families living in 33 cities in the San Gabriel Valley. The patients, many of 
whom are schizophrenic, suicidal or deeply depressed, largely speak no English 
and have no where else to go, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
The board resumes deliberations on the $10.3-billion county budget this 
afternoon. If they are to find additional funds for mental health needs, the 
supervisors must balance a host of competing demands from health, criminal 
justice and welfare agencies. The board is expected to approve the budget for 
the 1990 fiscal year this week. 
</P>
<P>
While mental health has been hit the hardest, other departments, most notably, 
Health Services, also are facing significant cuts. But the gloomy picture that 
Health Service officials painted last week now appears brighter than it was, 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Department of Health Services faced an $81.8-million deficit 
that would have removed hundreds of beds from the county's already overcrowded 
hospitals. But county officials are now recommending that the supervisors spend 
$66.2 million more on Health Services, leaving a deficit of $15.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The extra money would come from a variety of new fees the county may now 
charge, as well as the expected proceeds from one of two initiatives on the 
November ballot that would increase the tax on liquor, wine and beer. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Health Director Robert Gates said a proposed cut of $15.6 million would 
mean more delays for patients, who already wait up to four months for 
appointments at the county's public health centers and hospitals. Overall, the 
system will have to cut back patient visits by about 10%, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is far outstripped by spending requests, the supervisors will begin 
their final round of budget discussions with a $23.7-million pot of uncommitted 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The county budget would grow 5.3% overall and includes funds for 100 new 
sheriff's deputies, 11 new fire stations in fast-growing areas, land for new 
courthouses and funds to increase community library staffs and facilities.

FINANCING THE 'NEXT PICTURE SHOW'; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN MAJOR STUDIOS BALKED, TINY CINE-SOURCE PUT ITSELF ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the acclaimed 1971 film "The Last Picture Show," director Peter Bogdanovich 
created a bleak portrait of a small Texas town in the 1950s. Now, 19 years 
later, Bogdanovich, whose up-and-down career has careened downward in recent 
years, is attempting a comeback with the sequel to "Picture Show" called 
"Texasville," which is due out next month. 
</P>
<P>
None of the major studios would touch Bogdanovich's latest project -- possibly 
because the film might not appeal to mass audiences or because of Bogdanovich's 
reputation for disputing studio dictates -- even though he lined up original 
"Picture Show" cast members Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
So the director turned to an obscure, 2-year-old Universal City company, 
Cine-Source Inc., to arrange the financing for "Texasville." Tiny Cine-Source 
is hoping that "Texasville" -- based on a novel by Larry McMurtry, also the 
author of "The Last Picture Show" -- will put it on the Hollywood map. 
</P>
<P>
"How it will do critically and how it will do at the box office, no one can 
guess," said Cine-Source President Robert Whitmore. "But it's a great motion 
picture and we have every reason to believe it's going to be an enormous 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich said a few other companies, including Carolco Pictures, had 
expressed interest in "Texasville." But, he said, "There certainly was some 
reluctance in this town about this project. I don't know that it was 
specifically me, but it was a difficult project." 
</P>
<P>
Though Bogdanovich's career seems to be on the upswing again -- he now has a 
Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder movie in development at Tri-Star -- he said he'd work 
with Cine-Source again. "They put themselves on the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As did a lot of other people. Cine-Source spread the film's risk among a 
variety of investors including foreign investors, and through the sale of cable 
and home video rights. By lining up financing for the film's $24 million in 
production, promotion and advertising costs from these parties, Cine-Source 
limits its risk and avoids having to give away a bigger chunk of the picture's 
gross revenue to obtain the backing of a major studio, Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
Cine-Source will reap 25.5% of the gross of "Texasville" after distribution 
fees and certain other costs are deducted, Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
But even though it's limiting its risk, Cine-Source is still taking a chance 
with Bogdanovich's latest film. 
</P>
<P>
After "Picture Show," Bogdanovich was glowingly compared to Orson Welles, and 
he scored subsequent successes with "Paper Moon" and "What's Up, Doc?" But he 
also had some celebrated flops such as "At Long Last Love" and "Daisy Miller." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich became known for pushing the careers of his girlfriends, such as 
Shepherd, at the expense of his films. The director sealed his reputation as a 
troublemaker after a bitter dispute with Universal Pictures over the music in 
his last film, "Mask," in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich's personal life has also had an arguably negative impact on his 
career. After the 1980 murder of his then-girlfriend, Playboy playmate Dorothy 
Stratten, Bogdanovich publicly clashed with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Last 
year, the director's marriage to Stratten's 20-year-old sister raised eyebrows 
even in freewheeling Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Whitmore steadfastly defended Bogdanovich: "It's not easy for a 
director to always be a rational man in the throes of the creative process." 
But, he said, there were no problems on the set of "Texasville," and the film 
came in on time and on budget. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore and his long-time partner, Cine-Source Chairman Henry Weinstein, were 
first approached with "Texasville" in February, 1989, by agent Martin Baum at 
Creative Artists Agency. Nelson Entertainment entered as the other production 
entity and, through an existing distribution agreement, arranged to have the 
film distributed through Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
A victory at the box office would not only make money for Cine-Source and its 
investors, it would also give the company the cachet it needs to continue 
making films. "If you've got a track record, then the big boys will compete for 
you and they'll distribute your product," said Peter Appert, director of 
research at the New York investment firm C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But, Appert warned, "The odds are really stacked against the independent 
producer." 
</P>
<P>
That's partly because many independents don't have the financial wherewithal to 
wait out the time it takes to start recouping money from the movie's being 
shown in foreign markets, and on cable and home video. "The cash return on a 
theatrical film can often require the funding sources to wait two to four years 
to see their cash back," said Jeffrey Logsdon, senior vice president of the Los 
Angeles investment firm Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Several independent production companies, including De Laurentiis Entertainment 
Group, Cannon Films and Vestron, have collapsed in the past few years after 
producing movies with studio-sized budgets and disappointing box-office 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
But some investors are betting that Cine-Source will beat the odds. The 
company's stock trades on the over-the-counter market at about 38 cents a 
share, giving the company a market value of about $2.24 million. Not bad for a 
company that took in just $96,000 in revenue -- from producer's fees -- and 
lost $304,077 from its start-up date in July, 1988, to Jan. 31 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cine-Source also recently raised $1.5 million -- netting about $1.25 million 
after expenses -- from a public offering of 200,000 units. Each unit consists 
of two shares of preferred stock, which are convertible into six shares of 
common stock, and two warrants to buy additional stock. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Lutsky, a Denver investor who was one of the first investors in 
Cine-Source, called the company "a little diamond in the rough." 
</P>
<P>
Lutsky was particularly impressed with Weinstein's background. Weinstein once 
headed production at Cannon Pictures, worked on films at MGM and 20th Century 
Fox, and -- with Whitmore -- executive-produced the critically praised 1985 
film "Runaway Train." 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore insists that Cine-Source will avoid the fate of unsuccessful 
independents by staying small and lean. The company has just seven employees 
and plans to do no more than three films a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no illusions of grandeur," said Whitmore. "We're not trying to be a 
major studio. We don't have our own art department. We don't have our own 
production coordinators. We don't have an in-house promotion guy." The typical 
Cine-Source film will have a production budget of about $10 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Matus, senior vice president in charge of Bank of America's entertainment 
and media group, said this type of strategy represents a new era among 
independent production companies -- in which the survivors are avoiding the 
excesses of the past. "Those that remain appear to be very conservatively run 
companies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cine-Source is also working on four other films: "Black Orpheus," a remake of 
the 1959 Oscar winner for best foreign film that will begin shooting in Brazil 
in February; "Five-O," a Brooklyn-based drama starring rap musician Kool Moe 
Dee; "Three Part Harmony," with Irene Cara; and "Louise," based on the life of 
Wells Fargo heiress Louise Hellman. 
</P>
<P>
Cine-Source also recently set up a subsidiary designed to exploit the musical 
soundtracks of its films -- a potential source of profits and a means to 
promote its films, Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the boyish, 42-year-old Whitmore, an attorney who once ran his 
own music management firm, and the rotund Weinstein, 66, seem an unlikely pair. 
But they say the partnership strikes a balance between Whitmore's business 
acumen and Weinstein's production skills. 
</P>
<P>
The pair met in New York in the late-1970s and later formed a production 
company, Skyfield Productions, that worked mostly on TV movies. After "Runaway 
Train," which received three Academy Award nominations, Weinstein went to 
Cannon. But he and Whitmore soon talked about teaming up again. In 1988, they 
formed Cine-Source, which then merged with Starwood Ventures, a publicly traded 
shell company, in a stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not "Texasville" is a hit at the box office, Whitmore says 
Cine-Source will keep making movies. "There's always a market for an 
intelligently done motion picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that "Texasville" will show that his and Weinstein's instincts 
were correct and that "we were right to work with Peter."

increase in revenue. 
</P>

down from $27.5 million, while its revenue climbed to $526.1 million from

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: RADIO STATION KBET-AM FILES FOR REORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KBET, the only radio station in the Santa Clarita Valley, filed for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The July 23 filing "will allow us to catch our breath and reposition the debts" 
of the 1,000-watt station on 1220 AM, said Carl Goldman, a consultant brought 
in to oversee the station's restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it 
works out a strategy to pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
The station listed assets of $275,000 and debts of $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
KBET, owned by Canyon Broadcasters Inc. in Canyon Country, has struggled under 
financial and legal problems since it debuted in mid-1989. Last month, it 
indefinitely laid off several on-air personalities and switched to a format of 
playing only Beatles songs. The station switched formats again last week and 
now plays "oldies" music. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Broadcasters is attempting to sell the station, which plans to retain 
its "oldies" format at least until it is sold, Goldman said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ELECTRONIC CLEARING PLANS TO SELL MORE STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Electronic Clearing House Inc., an Agoura Hills provider of electronic credit 
card and check-clearing services, plans to sell an additional 3.6 million 
common shares through the securities firm J.W. Gant &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it 
plans to use the sale's proceeds to repay debt, purchase equipment and develop 
software. 
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the stock would be an extremely speculative investment 
because of Electronic Clearing's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The company lost $171,000 on revenue of $6.34 million in the nine months that 
ended June 30, after losing $722,000 in its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 
1989. The company has had no earnings from operations since fiscal 1985, and 
its existing stock trades for about 87 cents a share in over-the-counter 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the SEC charged the company with late filing of several financial 
reports, and Electronic Clearing agreed to a consent judgment barring it from 
further violations of federal securities regulations. The company said it 
planned to file all future financial reports on time.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: INCOMNET'S EARNINGS UP 35% IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incomnet Inc. of Westlake Village said it earned $139,237 in the second quarter 
that ended June 30, up 35% from $103,454 in net income a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues rose 86% to $756,916 from $407,638. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which runs a computerized auto parts trading network, said that in 
the six months ending in June earnings fell 39% to $189,926 from $311,060 in 
the same period in 1989. Revenues increased 89% to $1.54 million from $816,325. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the decline in earnings in the six-month period was due to 
securities gains of $442,206 in 1989's first half. Otherwise, it said, results 
improved because of growth in its computerized trading network and new software 
division.

YOUR BODY: A BOOM FOR IN VITRO FERTILIZATION PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, there were just two in vitro fertilization programs in the United 
States to help infertile couples conceive. Today, the American Fertility 
Society reports there are 192 IVF programs across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere, says the society, is the baby-making boom bigger than in Southern 
California, home to at least 18 IVF centers, most based in hospitals or 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're suffering from infertility, this is the place to be," said David 
Hill, laboratory director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Century 
City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But with the multitude of choices comes a dilemma: how to select the best 
center? 
</P>
<P>
Often, patients are sent to a particular center by a gynecologist, usually when 
a couple has not conceived after a year of intercourse without birth control. 
Sometimes, couples search for a center on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, experts agree, couples should prepare themselves for the search as 
seriously as they would prepare for parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
To make an informed choice, couples should ask many questions about the 
programs they are considering. Here are some basic ones to ask: 
</P>
<P>
* What are the qualifications of the physicians? "The ideal is to see a 
board-certified reproductive endocrinologist or someone with comparable 
training," said Joyce Zeitz, spokeswoman for the American Fertility Society. 
</P>
<P>
* Does the center devote full-time to fertility patients? "Timing can be vital 
in infertility treatment," said Zeitz. "You want to be sure someone is 
available for you when you need a particular procedure." It may be 
psychologically easier to go to a specialized fertility center, she added, 
since many infertile women may be uncomfortable sharing a waiting room with 
pregnant patients. 
</P>
<P>
* What is the range of services? Most IVF centers offer a wide range of 
services, collectively known as assisted reproductive technology, or ART. In 
IVF, for instance, the egg and sperm are combined in the laboratory and 
incubated before the embryos are transferred into the woman's uterus. In 
another procedure, GIFT (Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer) the eggs and sperm are 
transferred to the woman's fallopian tube to allow fertilization to take place 
there. 
</P>
<P>
* What is the success rate? Experts agree this is the trickiest question and 
consumers need to ask it very specifically -- and in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
Ask: What is the overall success rate? "The national delivery rate for the IVF 
technique is 12%," said Zeitz. "Reproductively normal couples, in comparison, 
have a 30% chance of conceiving and carrying to term in a single cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Ask: "How many patients have you treated with my particular problem in my age 
group?," Zeitz suggested. "What are their success rates?" Be aware that many 
factors influence success rates. A woman under 35, for example, whose partner 
has no fertility problems will probably do better than a woman over age 40 
whose partner has sperm problems, Hill said. There is yet another way to ask 
about success rates, said Dr. Arthur Wisot, staff physician at the In Vitro 
Fertilization Center at South Bay Hospital, Redondo Beach, and co-author of 
"New Options for Fertility": "How many pregnancies and live births have you 
achieved in how many tries over one year's time?" 
</P>
<P>
* Does the program include psychological support services? "This is an 
extremely stressful treatment," said Wisot, "and the couple needs ongoing 
emotional support." 
</P>
<P>
* What are the fees? Cost is a factor, experts agree, especially since 
insurance often does not reimburse for costs of fertility treatments. But fees 
should not be the overriding factor in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
* Where is the center located? Consider how far the center is from work or 
home. "During the first few weeks, there are many tests and procedures," said 
Hill. So, if two centers seem equally efficient, he suggests choosing the 
closer one. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing an IVF center may one day be easier. Last month, Rep. Ron Wyden (D -- 
Ore.) introduced legislation to regulate the nation's IVF centers. His proposed 
Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act is under preliminary 
review, according to Wyden's Washington office.

When is it going to stop with 2 Live Crew? 
</P>
<P>
The notoriety following the Miami rap group's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album 
being declared obscene last June by a federal judge has led to a hit answer 
record -- "Banned in the U.S.A." -- and now the home video -- also titled 
"Banned in the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Can a "Banned in the U.S.A." book or T-shirt and car window reflector be far 
behind? 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew is turning into the biggest cottage industry in show business since 
the Simpsons and Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
You might not like group leader Luther Campbell's crude sense of humor -- his 
albums are mostly X-rated sexcapades in the old party-record style -- but 
you've got to admire his ability to take advantage of what could have been 
crippling adversity. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have asked for a home video that better showcased his story if he 
paid for it -- which, in effect, he did. Campbell is executive director of the 
47-minute "Banned in the U.S.A." home video, and it is released through 
A*Vision, the home video arm of Atlantic Records, which released Campbell's 
"Banned in the U.S.A." album. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily, Campbell had the good sense here to enlist Penelope Spheeris, who 
has directed several outstanding films about other rebel pop genres, including 
punk and heavy metal. This home video isn't in the same artistic league as her 
films. It lacks the objectivity and scope of those works. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's a more revealing way to sample the 2 Live Crew uproar than any of 
the group's albums. Spheeris mixes the rappers' promo videos with tapes of the 
group being interviewed by everyone from Phil Donahue to Miami reporters, and 
throws in some opponents of the group, who denounce the sexually explicit 
nature of the group's music and stage show. 
</P>
<P>
Most striking, however, is the footage by Spheeris' crew: the live show, 
including some audience participation in the steamy antics, and the ugliness of 
a crowd tearing up a Texas ballroom after 2 Live Crew canceled an appearance 
because of a financial dispute with promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's reaction to the latter shows just how adroit he is at making the 
best of a bad situation. Who else could view footage of the riot and -- noting 
the interracial make-up of the crowd that is demolishing the room's furniture 
-- declare the commotion a victory for integration?

STORMS LIGHT SUMMER SKY AND A RASH OF BRUSH FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The electrical storms that crackled through parts of California over the 
weekend staged pre-dawn and evening return engagements Monday, with more 
predicted, and left dozens of brush fires in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said lightning caused more than 100 brush fires to hopscotch through 
eight national forests in the state. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management 
recorded almost 9,000 separate lightning strikes between Bishop and the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Rainfall from the storms ranged from 0.11 of an inch at San Juan Capistrano to 
only a trace at most other locations. 
</P>
<P>
More thunder and lightning storms formed in the coastal mountains Monday 
evening, following winds from the east and southeast, said Steve Burback, 
meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a repeat pattern day after day, until drier air comes in from 
southwestern winds," he added. "It will probably stay that way for the next 
three to five days." 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Mountains and foothill communities were the scene of most of 
the action Monday night, with spectacular lightning displays, numerous small 
related brush fires and brief power outages. 
</P>
<P>
And thunder reverberated eerily through the high-rises in downtown Los Angeles 
late into the night as the storms moved to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fires reported during the day were small, including five in Angeles 
National Forest. They were either quickly controlled or not considered 
threatening, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A San Bernardino National Forest spokeswoman described fires there as "spot 
fires, a bush here, a tree there, or a little snag of grass." 
</P>
<P>
The various small blazes included four in San Bernardino National Forest, 40 in 
Stanislaus National Forest east of Sonora and 35 in Sierra National Forest east 
of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
But two fires in Kern County's Sequoia National Forest were still out of 
control late Monday and had consumed a combined 1,620 acres. Six bulldozers, 
three helicopters and 600 firefighters were battling the flames. 
</P>
<P>
The blazes were burning in separate areas northwest of Kernville but were 
expected to merge into one large fire, forest information officer Lindsay 
Maierhofer said. Flames advanced slowly on the small community of Wofford 
Heights, located between Kernville and Lake Isabella, Monday evening, bringing 
a call for a voluntary evacuation of residents as a precaution, but a fire 
spokesman said, "There is no immediate threat to the town." 
</P>
<P>
A third lightning-caused fire had consumed 10 acres by late Monday, Maierhofer 
added. 
</P>
<P>
In Stanislaus National Forest, Assistant Fire Management Officer Gary Biehl 
said none of the fires had burned more than three acres and most had fire crews 
on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bringing additional resources in in case the storms recur," he added, 
"and as of now we are guardedly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, two fires started in Cleveland National Forest. One burned 
about two acres and was put out Monday. Another on the Viejas Indian 
Reservation was still going Monday night after scorching more than 150 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Land Management reported three fires, none exceeding six acres 
and all listed as controlled Monday, said Dick Franklin, district fire 
management officer. One was near Mojave in the Tehachapis and two in Yucca 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Basin, a lightning-caused brush fire consumed about seven 
acres in Rancho Palos Verdes. The pre-dawn storm that caused it also created an 
unscheduled sound and light show for many in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Howlett of the Palos Verdes Peninsula said she and her husband were 
awakened by the storm shortly after 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
They walked onto their balcony to watch the lighting streak back and forth 
across the sky above the ocean. "It was very exciting, and so bright I felt I 
had to put sunglasses on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple saw the small brush fire start "as a circle that got bigger and 
bigger," Howlett said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fire Department said the blaze at Palos Verdes Drive 
South and Peppertree Drive in Rancho Palos Verdes was quickly extinguished and 
no homes or other structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, lightning strikes ignited four small brush fires in the northern 
part of Los Angeles County, but no serious damage resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning set off two small brush fires in a mountainous area north of Granada 
Hills, burning about two acres of brush just north of the Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill on San Fernando Road shortly before 6 p.m., Los Angeles city fire 
officials said. Four water-dropping helicopters and 18 engine companies 
extinguished them. 
</P>
<P>
In Newhall, lightning started two fires west of the Golden State Freeway near 
Weldon Summit shortly before 6 p.m. They burned about an acre of brush, county 
fire officials said. Two water-dropping helicopters and 150 firefighters 
extinguished the blazes within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning strikes also triggered power outages in communities throughout the 
San Fernando, Santa Clarita and San Gabriel valleys Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison said more than 1,000 customers were affected from 
Newhall to Glendale and Pasadena, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water and Power estimated that 800 customers were in the dark 
for a time in Mission Hills and Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was spared any major storm damage. County fire officials reported 
no lightning-related brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected storm, however, put on quite a show for some residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very long, enduring storm," said Jeff Miller, a resident of San Juan 
Capistrano who has his own weather station at home. "(The lightning) was very 
frequent, maybe 30 seconds apart." 
</P>
<P>
Hot, muggy weather continued throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury peaked at 89 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center, Anaheim and 
Long Beach.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FIREWORKS MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council today will consider whether to place on the ballot a measure 
that would ban the sale and use of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the second time Fullerton has considered a fireworks ban. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the council voted 3 to 2 against the idea, despite the Fire 
Department's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Molly McClanahan, who along with Councilman Don Bankhead voted for 
the ban on so-called "safe and sane" fireworks, said she is not certain how she 
will vote this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some decisions should be made by the City Council," McClanahan said. 
"I don't think we should run to the voters every time a decision has to be 
made. That's what we're here for." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Chris Norby and Richard C. 
Ackerman previously voted not to ban fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin, who will be attending his first council meeting since his June 20 
body-surfing accident, said he is undecided on the issue. Although he was 
impressed by the city's fireworks show last month -- intended to discourage 
private use of fireworks -- "I also want to emphasize the need to be careful 
about destroying tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman, who opposes any fireworks ban, said, "All I know is that no one has 
been circulating a petition, and there doesn't appear to be a public outcry 
calling for the banning of fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
In October, Fire Chief Ron Coleman warned the council that people from 
neighboring cities that outlaw fireworks increasingly were coming to Fullerton 
to use them. As a result, Coleman said the dangers have increased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Coleman's recommendations, two Orange County grand juries also 
have urged Fullerton to ban fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, "safe and sane" fireworks are banned in the unincorporated county 
area and in 23 Orange County cities. ERIK HAMILTON

BICYCLE REGISTRATION DRIVE SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because only about 300 bicycles are registered in this city of 75,000, 
officials are holding a bicycle registration day Saturday at the Oso Viejo 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real important," said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. George Johnson. "We do 
it to get people's bikes back to them when they are stolen." 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 bicycles were reported stolen in Mission Viejo last year, he 
said. In areas of the county served by the Sheriff's Department, more than 600 
bicycles lacking identification were recovered but couldn't be returned to 
their owners. 
</P>
<P>
The registration at the community center, 24932 Oso Viejo Road, will be held 
between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. Cost for a three-year permit is $2.

OCTD MANAGER PAY BOOSTED TO $93,984 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Transit District board on Monday unanimously approved an 
additional 5% pay raise for district General Manager James P. Reichert, 
bringing his annual increase to 10%. His new salary is $93,984 a year. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Joanne Curran said Reichert's four-year contract, which 
ends Nov. 1, 1993, calls for an automatic 5% increase this year and next year, 
plus a 6% increase in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 5 to 0 to approve the pay package and give Reichert an 
additional 5% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the board was split 3 to 2 on the question of whether to give 
Reichert a multi-year contract. Members Richard B. Edgar, William Farris and 
John Erskine approved the agreement, citing Reichert's job performance. But 
another board member, County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, called the contract a 
"guaranteed giveaway of raises in advance." 
</P>
<P>
Curran said the OCTD set a ridership record in the last year with 46 million 
passengers. The district has 1,500 employees, nearly 600 buses and vans and an 
operating budget of $184.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reichert has been with OCTD since 1973. He became general manager in March, 
1978. GEORGE FRANK

YOUTH AID PROGRAMS FACE MONEY CUTOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first round of repercussions from the recently enacted 1990-91 state 
budget, county supervisors today are expected to put five programs that serve 
troubled children on notice that their contracts may soon be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"These community-based organizations may really take a hit," said Rod Speer, 
information services representative for the county Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
"This is devastating." 
</P>
<P>
The state budget, which was signed last week after a long battle in Sacramento, 
cuts funding for the county Justice System Subvention Program by 49%, a 
reduction of $2.5 million, county officials said. That has forced the Probation 
Department to quickly identify areas that can be trimmed while still providing 
state-mandated services such as providing lawyers for accused juvenile 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, programs that shelter runaways, provide job counseling and 
emergency services to former inmates and give advice to other struggling young 
people could become the first victims of the budget ax this year. 
</P>
<P>
"All the departments that are facing cuts are identifying the programs 
affected," said Ronald Rubino, the county's administrative officer for 
management and budget. "The process has already begun in a number of areas." 
</P>
<P>
If private funding can be arranged or if any of the state funding is later 
restored, a prospect that county officials consider unlikely, then some of the 
programs could be reinstated. If not, their money will dry up in 30 days. JIM

CITY COUNCIL PASSES SECRECY ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG and GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a testy debate, the City Council passed a controversial ordinance Monday 
night that would subject council members to $1,000 fines or six-month jail 
terms if they disclose any matter discussed in closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 3 to approve Councilman Daniel E. Griset's proposal that 
prohibits council members from disclosing any issue discussed in closed session 
without authority from the rest of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also targets city employees "or any other person present" during 
closed council sessions, which are permitted by the state's open-meetings law 
only for discussions about personnel or pending litigation. The state law 
contains no prohibition against revealing the content of closed meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron May, who voted against the ordinance, said he did not think it 
was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the public has long been leery and suspicious whenever elected bodies 
break for executive session," May said. "I think the feeling is that's where 
the real decisions are made. Any ordinance with such stipulations, to me, 
increases the mystique of public government. I can't support this." 
</P>
<P>
Griset, however, said the ordinance was "a good proposal" that will help save 
taxpayer money by preventing "costly leaks." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, City Atty. Edward J. Cooper presented a memo to council members that 
outlined what they could not discuss outside of closed sessions. These items 
included pending litigation, labor and personnel matters, applications for city 
licenses, purchases and sales of properties and threats to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been studying Griset's proposal since its June 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Griset said "leaks of information" could cost the city millions of dollars in 
contract negotiations or litigation. 
</P>
<P>
During the council's debate Monday night, Councilman Richards L. Norton argued 
that Griset's proposal jeopardizes the public's right to know what the council 
does in closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The council has at least two closed sessions each month -- either before or 
after the public portion of the meeting. In the proposed law, those who attend 
closed sessions could disclose only the content of discussions with permission 
from the majority of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance mirrors one in Costa Mesa, the only city in the county that 
has such a prohibition. Costa Mesa's ordinance was passed in 1962 and updated 
in 1985. LILY ENG and GREG HERNANDEZ

PARTIES AGREE TO RUSH GAIDO SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the deadline approaching to hold a special election to fill an open City 
Council seat, attorneys for Mary Ann Gaido and the city of Irvine have agreed 
upon a rushed set of court dates for her lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido sued the city last month, alleging that the special election shouldn't be 
held and that she should be seated on the council. Under city election law, 
Gaido would have filled the open seat because she was the third-place finisher 
in the June council race. But a residents' group filed a petition last month, 
calling for the special election. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ballots for the special City Council election will be printed Aug. 
31, a Superior Court judge agreed with the attorneys to hear Gaido's lawsuit on 
that date rather than wait for the original Sept. 14 hearing, City Atty. John 
Fellows said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We both want to cooperate to get this resolved as quickly as possible so 
there's no cloud hanging over anybody during the election," Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge sides with Gaido, the special election would be canceled and Gaido 
would take the open seat. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido's suit alleges that the election should not be held because the petition 
filed with the city contains numerous flaws. Proper procedures were not 
followed in gathering the signatures and other information from the registered 
voters signing the petition, Gaido contends. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council disagreed, however, and called an election for Nov. 6 to fill 
the seat vacated by Sally Anne Sheridan, who was elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Aug. 31 hearing, Fellows will try to have the lawsuit dismissed and 
have the attorneys representing Gaido removed from the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Fellows filed a motion Monday contending that Gaido's attorneys, Stephen Coontz 
and Franklin J. Lunding Jr., have a conflict of interest with the city. The two 
previously worked for the city and could have an unfair advantage due to 
confidential information they might have received, Fellows alleges. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing to consider disqualifying Coontz and Lunding has been set for Aug. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Coontz, a San Juan Capistrano attorney, said that he and Lunding have no 
conflict of interest with the city. While working for the city on election 
matters, he said, they did not learn confidential information and based their 
work only on public city records. TOM McQUEENEY

RASH OF BICYCLE THEFTS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are investigating about 100 bicycle thefts in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Department spokesman Andy Gonis said the thieves know 
which bikes are among the most expensive. Last weekend, there were 13 bicycles 
reported stolen, one of which was valued at about $750, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police suspect that the crimes are the work of an organized group specializing 
in bicycle thefts, and are warning residents to lock their garages, lock 
bicycles and remove bicycle wheels even when bicycles are parked in garages. 
</P>
<P>
Although summer often brings more bicycle thefts, this year's increase has been 
unusually dramatic, Gonis said. Police have made some arrests but have been 
unable to reverse the trend, he said.

A 12-year-old boy escorted his 4- and 5-year-old sisters from a burning 
apartment building on Monday and then dialed 911 for help, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 8:17 a.m. fire was started by one of the children playing with matches in a 
bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused about $60,000 damage to the apartment complex at 120 Nisson 
Road, Orange County Fire Department Spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said the children were home alone when the fire broke out. Fire officials 
said the boy acted quickly to ensure the safety of his sisters and notify 
authorities of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a real good job of remaining calm and doing the right things," said 
Fire Department Capt. Dan Young, who added that the boy had recently completed 
a junior fire safety program at his school. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials have not identified which child was playing with matches. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and police officials on Monday were investigating the circumstances of the 
fire and why the children were left unsupervised.

STATUE MAKER CITED IN ACID LEAK;

<P>
A father and two sons who own and operate Statueland, a landmark in Garden 
Grove for 41 years, were each charged Monday with two misdemeanor counts of 
allowing a powerful acid to leak onto public land. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney filed the criminal complaint against 
Woodrow Butterfield, 71, who owns the statue-manufacturing company, and his 
sons, Kenneth Irwin Butterfield, 28, and Silas Gregory Butterfield, 32, who 
operate it. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jerry Johnston said muriatic acid, used by the company to 
clean its stone statues, flowed off the property and pooled onto land owned by 
the Orange County Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Samples taken more than a week apart showed that the acid in the pond was 
potent enough to eat through leather and burn skin, health officials said. 
Johnston said washing the statues and letting the acid drain onto the property 
apparently was a practice at Statueland for at least several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The standing pool of water, about 35 feet by 10 feet, became so acidic that it 
was hazardous waste," said Johnston, one of the county's environmental-crimes 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Statueland, at 13960 Harbor Blvd., is well known in Garden Grove as an island 
of marble and cement fountains and garden ornaments, including Venus de Milos, 
mermaids and busts of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Woodrow Butterfield was a Garden Grove city councilman from 1972 until 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield said Monday that the spill was a one-time accident in March and 
that he already has spent more than $14,000 to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't deny acid got down there, but it was so diluted it was harmless," he 
said. "I got a sample and drank a cup of it. I had a good-sized swig of it. 
That's how bad it really was. It wouldn't have burned anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield called the criminal case "total overkill." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised they didn't charge my dog Fang. She had just as much to do with 
this as I did. Maybe more, because I was in Europe when it happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the men would each face fines of at least $10,000 but no more 
than $200,000, and up to a year in jail, although jail sentences are rare in 
misdemeanor toxic-waste cases.

<P>
A Santa Ana woman was arrested on suspicion of murder Monday after the body of 
a baby girl believed to be hers was found in a Dumpster, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandra Baena, 19, was booked into the Anaheim City Jail after police 
recovered the baby girl's body from a Dumpster behind an apartment complex in 
the 800 block of South Anaheim Boulevard about 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the scene estimated that the baby had been dead for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the nearby apartments said there had been an odor since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ray Welch said the age of the baby was not immediately known. He said 
police were first alerted by an anonymous call at 1:30 p.m. Monday that there 
was a dead baby "in a container" near the apartment complex. At the direction 
of another witness, officers searched a large bin used for commercial waste, 
Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said officers enlisted the help of a local sanitation crew to empty the 
Dumpster. After sifting through debris for two hours, Welch said, the body was 
discovered at the bottom of the Dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim homicide detectives tracked down Baena after questioning residents in 
the vicinity, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
At the apartment complex, residents said Baena was a gentle-natured woman who 
baby-sat for Maria Candidad Romero's three children. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said that she did not know Baena had been pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"She hid it," Romero said.

GERMANY'S EAGLES BARELY FLYING; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: BERLIN TEAM, WHICH PLAYS AMERICAN VERSION OF THE GAME, IS SUCCESSFUL, 
BUT VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN IN THE COUNTRY.

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a land where 1-0 soccer scores prompt national celebrations and general 
mayhem, a quarterback who threw 52 touchdown passes in a single season might as 
well have not existed. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the staggering popularity climb American football faces in Germany. 
There are three sporting names that matter here: Steffi Graf, Boris Becker and 
Franz Beckenbauer. If your name is not among them, take your proper place 
behind a long and lonely offensive line in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Madison, a graduate of Crenshaw High in Los Angeles, is quarterback for 
Germany's best American football team, the Berlin Adler (Eagles). His team 
scored more than a 100 points in a game three times last season on its way to 
Germany's equivalent of the Super Bowl title. Madison threw for 4,028 yards in 
10 games, which included one nine-touchdown performance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, hardly anyone knows of him. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, one country's definition of excitement is not another's, as the NFL 
will learn as it attempts to export its brand of football to a new Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But if 52 touchdown passes doesn't grab your attention, what will? For one, a 
World Cup soccer championship, no matter what the complaints about aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just learning American football," Madison said. "It hasn't even caught 
on yet. Most people know very little about it." 
</P>
<P>
Madison said there are no attempts to compete with soccer, the national sport. 
American football was probably set back further after West Germany's recent 
victory in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"Berlin was wild," Madison said. "So many things were happening at the time. 
The wall came down, Germany takes the Cup. I mean how much better can it get 
for a city like this?" 
</P>
<P>
If you said the Rams and Kansas City Chiefs this weekend at Olympic Stadium, 
perhaps it's time to loosen the straps on your leder hosen. 
</P>
<P>
But until they deport Madison for preferring his brand of football, he promises 
to keep lighting up scoreboards to the sound of no applause. 
</P>
<P>
"I look in the stands sometimes, and I say 'Where are the people?' " he said. 
"This is America's sport. But that's why I like scoring 60 or 70 points a game. 
I let them know, this is football, this is not soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Madison's team, the Adler, is one of about 75 club teams competing in the 
country's Bundes Football League. The Berlin squad plays on a grass field 
encircled by a bicycle track. Madison said crowds range from between three and 
four thousand per game. As part of Saturday's scheduled events, Berlin will 
play the Dussaldorf Panthers before the Rams and Chiefs take the field. 
</P>
<P>
Madison joined the Adler in April, 1989, after playing out all his options in 
the states. He attended three colleges, had a brief stint in the Canadian 
Football League, and last played for the Chicago Bruisers of the Arena Football 
League in 1988. The Bruisers picked him up after Madison was beaten out by Matt 
Stevens for quarterback of the L.A. Cobras. 
</P>
<P>
After his Arena career ended, Madison attended another pro tryout camp that was 
held at UC Irvine. Madison's logic was simple: 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody picked me up, and I didn't feel like working 9 to 5," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A coach at the tryout suggested Europe, and Madison soon found himself in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of three Americans on the team. The star receiver, though, is German. 
His name is Roman Motzkus, who has 20 touchdown catches with one game remaining 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Motzkus, one German who considers American football more than a passing fancy, 
watched Monday's Ram practice with uncommon awe. 
</P>
<P>
His favorite American player is San Francisco's Jerry Rice, but he wears 
uniform No. 83 in honor of Ram receiver Flipper Anderson. Motzkus came to know 
Anderson after his game-winning playoff catch last year against the New York 
Giants. The game was broadcast live in Germany at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps I'd like to meet him," Motzkus said as he watched Anderson run a pass 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The German's club football season runs from April to October. 
</P>
<P>
The teams are staffed with German coaches, but Madison finds himself doing most 
of the teaching for the Adler. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaching staff is not really obligated," he said. "They have to work and 
take care of their families. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a head coach. I run the offense. We have three assistants and 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
When none of the coaches had arrived for a recent game, Madison ran the team 
from the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
Although Madison averaged 5.2 touchdown passes per game last season, he keeps 
the statistics in proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey man, these are phenomenal stats," he said. "But only over here, you know 
what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
The Adler pays Madison 3,000 German marks -- roughly $2,000 -- and furnishes 
him with an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Madison's goal is to catch the attention of someone in the newly-formed World 
Football League, which kicks off play in spring, 1991, with European teams in 
Frankfurt and Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can get a shot at it," he said. "I'm 27 years old, but I feel like 
23. My body's not aching at all. I've been in this game 20 years and my arm 
feels great. I am looking forward to leaving and joining one of these World 
Football teams." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The first of three scrimmages between the Rams and Chiefs is scheduled for 
today. "I think it's great," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "It begins the work 
of practicing against strangers. I think it's a nice step up." . . . Great 
arms, bad voices: Two generations of former Purdue quarterbacks, Len Dawson and 
Jim Everett, were reported out on the town Monday night, singing Elvis Presley 
songs in bad German accents. Dawson is a local television sports anchor in 
Kansas City. Everett, of course, plays quarterback for the Rams . . . Ram 
defensive end Bill Hawkins appeared to have aggravated an injury to his left 
knee in Monday's practice, but said the leg was just stiff from Saturday's long 
plane ride. Hawkins had surgery in December to repair a torn ligament in the 
knee. . . . Cornerback Darryl Henley (groin) and linebackers Larry Kelm (toe) 
and Fred Strickland (hamstring) also missed practice. Robinson said Kelm may be 
held out of Saturday's game as a precaution. . . . The best question of the day 
came from a German journalist who asked Everett: "In the United States, you are 
a star. But in Germany, it's a bit different. Who's Jim Everett? You're no 
Franz Beckenbauer. How does it affect you?" Everett's reply: "That's just fine 
with me. That's probably the way I'd like life anyways. I don't mind that one 
bit."

COPPOLA TO RESHOOT PORTIONS OF 'GODFATHER, PART III' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After spending $55 million and six months behind the camera, director Francis 
Ford Coppola will return to Italy to reshoot portions of his upcoming epic, 
"The Godfather, Part III," according to sources close to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 million in reshoots -- one week in Sicily in early September, followed 
by one week in New York, and involving stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton -- will 
boost the cost of the troubled production to more than $60 million, the sources 
said. Coppola has said that the film was budgeted at $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures President Sidney Ganis denied that there were problems with 
the movie. He said "any costs associated (with the reshoots) were absolutely, 
unequivocally budgeted" and involve "no major material whatsoever, only 
incidental scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Ganis declined to say whether Pacino and Keaton are involved in the new 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say the additional filming involves a love scene between Michael 
Corleone (Pacino) and his ex-wife (Keaton) and the clarification of a plot line 
about Corleone's connection to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
"Godfather III" focuses on Corleone's attempts to legitimize his empire by 
acquiring a European real estate firm, his Vatican connection and his 
relationships with his estranged son and wife. When Corleone takes ill during 
the height of a renewed gang war, he passes the baton of power to his 
illegitimate nephew (Andy Garcia). 
</P>
<P>
Both Paramount and Coppola have a lot riding on the much-heralded project. The 
first two "Godfather" movies -- released in 1972 and 1974 -- together grossed 
more than $700 million at theaters and earned another $100 million in TV and 
video sales. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, which has lost its historical dominance at the box office, could use 
another artistic and commercial success of that magnitude. The studio has been 
trying to get "Godfather III" off the ground since 1974, when the first sequel 
to Coppola's epic became a smash box-office hit and earned an Academy Award for 
best picture. 
</P>
<P>
For Coppola, "Godfather III" is a chance to revive his sagging reputation as 
one of the country's premier filmmakers and to pay off debts that forced him to 
put his Zoetrope Productions into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He is being 
paid $6 million to direct the film, sources close to the project say.

2 BROKERS TIED TO BOESKY SETTLE CASES

Two Los Angeles brokerage executives who cooperated with prosecutors in 
securities cases stemming from the Ivan F. Boesky insider trading scandals, 
settled administrative charges with federal regulators Monday. 
</P>
<P>
James T. Melton, who testified for the government at the GAF Corp. stock 
manipulation trial, and Michael Z. Landy, a government witness against takeover 
strategist Paul Bilzerian, settled actions brought by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Both men, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to a six-month ban 
from dealing in the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
Melton, 47, a former director of trading for Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; 
Co., testified at two of the three trials of GAF and its vice chairman, James 
Sherwin. They were accused of plotting to drive up the price of Union Carbide 
stock after a failed GAF takeover attempt of the Danbury, Conn.-based chemical 
maker. The case ended in a mistrial twice before a guilty verdict in December, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd L. Jefferies, who founded the securities firm and himself pleaded guilty 
to securities law violations, was the government's key witness against GAF, 
which was fined $2 million, and against Sherwin, who was sentenced to six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted stock speculator Boesky implicated Jefferies, along with several 
other Wall Street professionals, in the industry's biggest scandal. Melton left 
Jefferies &amp; Co. in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Landy, 47, a senior vice president at Jefferies, cooperated with investigators 
and testified at Bilzerian's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian was convicted of submitting false documents to the SEC, filing false 
tax returns and rigging transactions to skirt federal tax and disclosure laws 
in tandem with Jefferies. The case was the first criminal trial of illegal 
stock "parking," in which securities ownership is disguised to dodge federal 
tax or disclosure laws. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian was sentenced to four years and fined $1.5 million.

In its latest bid to reach young male consumers, Taco Bell Corp. launched a new 
$12-million advertising campaign Monday that features the rap artist Young MC 
pitching its products on the MTV cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign marks the first time that Taco Bell, a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc., 
has bought commercial time on a national cable television network. With the ad, 
the Irvine-based firm also joins other companies using rap music in their 
marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that rap music has entered the mainstream," said Taco Bell spokesman 
Elliot Bloom. "It really speaks to almost all of our audience." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Taco Bell believes the rap promotion will help it reach 12- to 
34-year-old males, the mainstay customers of the discount, Mexican-style, 
fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-food chain plans to spend $1 million in advertising on the Music 
Television network and much of the remaining $11 million on a plastic-cup 
giveaway. The multicolored cups are emblazoned with the logo of the MTV Video 
Music Awards. Taco Bell is a major sponsor of the Sept. 6 awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Young MC, in reality Marvin Young, is best known for his hit "Bust a Move," 
which earned him a Grammy Award for best new rap artist last year. The graduate 
of the University of Southern California is no stranger to commercials: He was 
the featured performer in Pepsi Cola's "Cool Cans" ad campaign this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We think rap is a great way of marketing our products to the youth market, and 
there could be no better rapper than Young MC," Bloom said. "He is a Grammy 
Award-winning artist; he is squeaky-clean; he is against drug use, against 
violence, and, in fact, much of his music speaks of this." 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial, Young MC performs a Taco Bell rap that talks of four 
giant-sized cups and a promise of free refills. He raps as colorful desert 
backgrounds pass by, "including four girls who magically turn into MTV 
collector cups," according to Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
A promotion with a rap artist as its focal point comes in sharp contrast to the 
"Tacos to Go" campaign over the summer, which sported Greg LeMond, the 
three-time winner of the Tour de France bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
That campaign took an ill-fated turn when Taco Bell had to recall millions of 
bicycle-type water bottles that were found to have a defective valve that could 
be easily swallowed by young children. This time, the company is playing it 
safe with a standard plastic cup.

PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN HEALTH SERVICES RESIGNS

The American Health Services Corp. chief executive credited with building the 
company into a $30-million operator of medical imaging centers resigned on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing that S. Lewis Meyer had stepped down as president, chief 
executive and a director, company officials offered no reason for the 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
American Health named E. Larry Atkins, the company's executive vice president 
and chief operating officer for the past four years, to replace Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday, American Health expressed its "appreciation for Meyer's 
efforts." Meyer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
American Health contracts with hospitals and other health-care providers to 
supply diagnostic equipment for such procedures as magnetic resonance imaging 
and computerized tomography at medical centers in 12 states and Puerto Rico. 
Eleven of the centers are in California. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said he plans to encourage the company's expansion by opening new 
centers. He said the number of centers is expected to increase to 40 by the end 
of this year, from nine in 1988. Twelve more centers are scheduled to open in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The publicly traded company, which employs 158 people, posted strong results 
for 1989. Net income was $910,145, contrasted with a loss of $4.7 million for 
the previous year, which included a loss of $4.1 million from discontinued 
operations. For the first quarter ended March 31, 1990, the company posted net 
income of $325,508, up from $106,666 for the like period in 1989. According to 
company spokesman Bradley Serwin, revenues for this year are projected at $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer had guided the 8-year-old company for the past 6 1/2 years. Before 
joining American Health, he was chief executive of Datatron Inc., a Tustin 
computer equipment company.

WAR: LIKE OTHER WWII VETERANS, THOSE WHO LANDED ON GUADALCANAL 48 YEARS AGO SEE 
IT AS THEIR DUTY TO KEEP ALIVE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THEIR WAR, DESPITE GROWING

The setting at Jeremiah Collins' little Costa Mesa outpost couldn't have been 
more military gung-ho, more rousingly patriotic, more evocative of a 
battle-forged camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
The five World War II Marine Corps veterans were meeting in Collins' garage, 
converted into a retired Leatherneck den overflowing with all sorts of banners, 
posters and other wartime memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead, fluttering in the breeze and visible to the whole street, was Old 
Glory itself, raised dutifully by Collins daily for the last 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
And the men themselves were there to remember once again that day -- exactly 48 
years today -- when they landed on a Godforsaken, Japanese-held Pacific island 
named Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalcanal? 
</P>
<P>
It may be forgotten by most in today's younger generations, but history books 
tell us that the U.S. victory at Guadalcanal was a World War II turning of the 
tide, coming eight months after the debacle at Pearl Harbor and two months 
after the epic defeat of the Japanese fleet off Midway. 
</P>
<P>
But that was too many yesterdays ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grandchildren barely know about World War II, let alone a Guadalcanal. I 
don't think they're even being taught about it in the schools," said Norton 
Henninger, 68, of Villa Park, who was 20 when he landed at Guadalcanal with 
thousands of other Marines on Aug. 7, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
But Henninger and the other Orange County veterans -- including Ed LeBlanc, 67, 
and Frank Aiello, 72, both of Costa Mesa, and Norris Cole, 66, of San Juan 
Capistrano -- have learned to live with this type of obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
After all, since 1942 two other wars have come and gone -- one of them, Korea, 
now just as obscure, the other, Vietnam, still shrouded by divisive debate. 
</P>
<P>
So, they said, why get worked up when people ignore a war fought more than four 
decades ago? 
</P>
<P>
"No big deal. Hell, Guadalcanal was a long time ago, and people have short 
memories," said Collins, 67, who was a 22-year career Marine who also served in 
China in 1946 and in Korea in 1950, where he earned a Silver Star. 
</P>
<P>
Then, before anyone gets the idea that these Marines are getting too soft -- or 
too mellowed with age -- Collins, in a barracks-booming voice, added: "But we 
remember! You can count on that!" 
</P>
<P>
Like other World War II veterans, Collins, Cole, LeBlanc, Henninger and Aiello 
see it as their duty to keep alive the achievements -- and significance -- of 
their war, despite growing obscurity and the shadows of time. 
</P>
<P>
Although they belong to the 3,000-strong Guadalcanal Campaign Veterans Assn. -- 
which includes Army, Navy and Coast Guard members -- they seldom make the 
association's national or regional reunions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, they gather to shoot the breeze in impromptu mini-reunions at 
local Veterans of Foreign Wars halls or at their homes, like the visit last 
week to Collins' garage museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," Cole said, "most of us aren't sitting around swapping old war stories. 
We talk about our families, about trips. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's about war, it's about the good times, or what now seem like the 
funny incidents to us," said Cole, who retired in 1961 as a gunnery sergeant 
after 20 years in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get into the sadder stuff, the grisly memories, unless someone asks 
us," added LeBlanc, a businessman ever since his World War II service. "It's 
not something you bring up on your own." 
</P>
<P>
Although all five men were with the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal, they 
didn't know each other during the war. That does not matter. Their lives are 
marked by an historic common denominator, an unspoken comradeship. They have 
Guadalcanal to remember. 
</P>
<P>
"It's with you all your lives, a wound mentally if not always physically," said 
LeBlanc, who, like the four other men, escaped serious injuries in the 
Guadalcanal and later Pacific campaigns. "You can't forget -- even if, 
sometimes, you wished you could." 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Aug. 7, 1942, flanked by a Navy armada, a 19,000-member 
Marine force landed -- the first units on four small nearby island strongholds, 
the main force on the 90-mile-long Guadalcanal itself, where the Japanese were 
completing a key airfield. 
</P>
<P>
To the U.S. high command in Washington and the Pacific, the taking of the 
Guadalcanal sector was absolutely essential in halting Japan's seemingly 
invincible push toward Allied-held Pacific bases and Australia itself. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
To the U.S. troops at ground zero, in the oppressively hot Guadalcanal sector, 
where thousands of Japanese soldiers were holed up in the jungle and ridges, 
the immediate concern was starkly more simple. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no tropical paradise, believe me," said Collins, who was with an 
engineer battalion. "It was a hellhole, a stinking, jungle-rotting island." 
</P>
<P>
"We were scared the day we landed until the day we left," recalled Cole, member 
of an intelligence patrol unit. "We didn't have enough to eat -- except tons of 
Japanese rice, crawling with vermin. We were short on vital equipment. We were 
left on our own for months." 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that the U.S. armada -- with much of the troops' supplies 
still unloaded -- had left after the first landings in the face of a powerful 
Japanese counterattack by sea. Also, as the Marines moved inland, they met 
fierce resistance from the Japanese, who were pouring in large numbers of 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc, a member of a rifle company, said: "We were pinned down by snipers or 
subjected to those wild, incredible banzai attacks. They kept charging, even 
though we kept cutting them down." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc remembers this especially horrendous sight: "We were moving forward 
behind our tanks. The tanks had to go over an area littered with Japanese 
bodies by the hundreds. The tanks chewed them up, like a meat grinder." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the day-and-night bombardment from Japanese ships, artillery and 
planes seemed ceaseless. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't sleep," said Henninger, who was a gun-placement crew member 
protecting the airstrip. "You felt helpless. All you could do was crawl into 
your dugout or foxhole and just pray." 
</P>
<P>
When the fighting ended in early 1943, more than 2,100 U.S. troops, including 
members of Army units, had been killed, according to the Guadalcanal veterans 
group. Another 4,000 Navy personnel were killed in the sea fighting. The number 
of Japanese troops killed was estimated at 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
But this was only the beginning for the members of the 1st Marine Division. 
They went on to other bloody Pacific island campaigns: Cape Gloucester on New 
Britain in 1943, then Peleliu, an island east of the Philippines, in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and the 
surrender ceremonies were held Sept. 2 in Tokyo Bay, the five of them -- 
Aiello, Cole, Collins, Henninger and LeBlanc -- were back in the United States 
with units being readied for the expected invasion of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Henninger, who remembers a big parade and a key-to-the-city ceremony 
in 1944 in Chicago, there were no big homecomings. However, like all the other 
military from the World War II campaigns, they were treated as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"America had been in mortal danger," Henninger said. "Everyone believed in the 
struggle, in what we were fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
"America was unified behind us . . . at least, back then." 
</P>
<P>
 To their dismay and disgust, America as a society seemed to fall into disarray 
in the "shooting wars" that followed: Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't let us win it," said Collins, who fought in late 1950 with the 
1st Marine Division at the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea, near the China 
border. "They (civilian authorities) stopped us at the Yalu (River). They 
didn't want us to get into China." 
</P>
<P>
It was far worse when it came to Vietnam in 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have stayed out of Vietnam," Cole said, "if we didn't have the 
stomach to go all the way and win. Instead, in that war it was political bull 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
The way returning Vietnam veterans were treated was "shabby and a disgrace," 
LeBlanc said. "People spat on them, tossed tomatoes at them. You had people 
running around the campuses, stirring up all those protests. Patriotism in this 
country really went down the drain in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 However, LeBlanc and the others believe that much of the protests and the 
"anti-military" attitude had subsided by the late 1980s. Vietnam veterans are 
now, very belatedly, getting hero treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism is now back in style," said Henninger, another career sergeant, who 
also served in Korea with the 1st Marine Division. "Well, OK, except for the 
flag burners. I don't even mind the flag burners . . . as long as it's wrapped 
around them when they burn it!" 
</P>
<P>
Some World War II veterans still feel an unrelenting enmity toward the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Henninger said: "We have every right to be so bitter. I was for a long time. We 
saw a lot of buddies killed -- my own brother was lost at Peleliu. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't go on hating forever. After all these years, you have to live 
and let live." 
</P>
<P>
To Collins and the others, the image of their role in World War II has not 
changed in the 48 years since Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
They say it has nothing to do with being heroes or wrapped with Hollywood-hyped 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our job -- as professional fighting men," said Aiello, looking at the 
other men seated around him. "It was what we were trained for, and we did it." 
</P>
<P>
"We were there," LeBlanc added, "to stop the Japanese, to help save the world 
and America, and to protect our loved ones. But it was supposed to be the last 
shooting war, the last time Americans had to go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Korea. We had Vietnam," LeBlanc added. "Our grandchildren's generation 
may have forgotten Guadalcanal, but we hope they're going to be OK. We hope 
they won't have to go and fight another war."

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: EASTERN WESTMINSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Westminster's most prominent symbol of its heritage is, of all things, 
a farm implement. The Post Brothers' Plow was built by Charles R. (Hap) and 
Norman R. Post in 1937 to reclaim farmland ruined by the flooding Santa Ana 
River. Measuring 37 feet long, 12 feet high and 11 feet wide, with a blade of 
86 inches, it is considered to be the world's largest plow. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of floods during the 1930s, the river had spilled over its banks, 
spreading silt. With its nutrients leached out, the land, no longer suitable 
for farming, was often abandoned. The plow, however, enabled farmers to bring 
the rich topsoil back to the surface after the floods, said Joy Neugebauer, 
chairman of the Westminster Historical Society. It brought back to life 6,000 
acres of important farmland. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing 15 tons, the carbon steel plow is mounted on a heavy frame with steel 
wheels more than six feet in diameter. It took five tractors to move the plow, 
which could dig a furrow 6 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
The plow was rented out at $100 per hour or per acre, and was sometimes used to 
cut a single deep furrow for a drainage ditch or a pipeline. And during the 
1940s it was taken to Nevada to dig the trenches for cables at bomb testing 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
The Post Brothers' Plow is on display at 15261 Brookhurst Ave., at the 
southwest corner of Bishop Place. Even though it is painted a bold shade of 
yellow, the plow is nearly hidden from view by an equally bold orange banner 
spread on the chain link fence surrounding the monument. The banner, 
advertising the Windmill Rental Office in large black lettering, is there 
simply to create interest in the 20-year-old Windmill apartments at Belgrade 
Street and McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The land on which the Post Brothers' Plow is displayed was once Rancho Bolsa, 
the Warne family ranch "since 1900," as the sign says. The Windmill apartments 
are also owned by the extended Warne family. 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Miriam Warne acquired the plow from Hap Post as a way of preserving the 
area's agricultural heritage, Neugebauer said. At one time the Warne family 
owned several hundred acres. "It (farming) was a way of life for so many 
years," Miriam Warne said at the Westminster Harvest Festival 10 years ago. 
"Things are changing now, but we want to preserve that way, so that children 
and future generations see how it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
This neighborhood is a microcosm of changes occurring in central Orange County 
-- Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Westminster. The Post Brothers' Plow, an Orange 
County historical site, is only blocks away from Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese have made their mark here. On Bolsa Avenue, a strip shopping 
center called Little Saigon Plaza features a music and video store, cleaners, 
supermarkets -- with Vietnamese names and signs. Most prominent among them is 
the Little Saigon Supermarket, featuring staples of Vietnamese cuisine among 
its offerings, and such favorites as pork feet, oxtail, black chicken, freshly 
severed catfish heads and soybean juice. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture gave way to shopping malls and housing in Westminster, and the 
choice of residence is varied. Immediately north of Edinger Avenue (actually a 
part of Fountain Valley, not Westminster), there are mostly single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
North of McFadden Avenue, though, the apartment complexes begin. The 
aforementioned Windmill apartments overlook Elden F. Gillespie Park (named for 
a former parks and recreation commissioner and the first elected mayor of 
Westminster), which is to the west just across Belgrade Street. North of Bishop 
Lane are the Cinnamon Creek Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Lane features two schools within two blocks. Bushard Street is the site 
of the Leo Carrillo School (named after the actor who played Pancho in the '50s 
TV series "The Cisco Kid"), an elementary school and home of the Carrillo 
Lions. The Sarah McGarvin Intermediate School (the McGarvins were the original 
landowners) and fields the McGarvin Owls. 
</P>
<P>
For those hesitant to lay down foundations, the Mission del Amo mobile home 
park offers another mode of living. The 25 1/2-acre (217-space) park opens onto 
both Bolsa Avenue and Bushard Street, north of Bishop Place. At the corner of 
Bushard Street and Bolsa Avenue lies the only undeveloped land in the 
neighborhood, other than two parks. 
</P>
<P>
But this tract of open land is slotted to meet its predictable fate: a new 
shopping mall.

<P>
Three teen-age girls from Orange who got lost Monday while hiking during a 
church outing in the rugged Angeles National Forest were rescued by authorities 
at dawn today, unharmed but shaken from their night under lightning and 
thunder-filled skies. 
</P>
<P>
The girls -- identified as Debbie Johnson, 13, Kristen Lawrence, 14, and 
Christina Roberts, 15 -- spent the night huddled together under leaves and pine 
trees and required no medical attention, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. 
Bobby Denham at the Antelope Valley substation. 
</P>
<P>
Other officers said the girls, camping with a Mormon church group from Orange, 
had left their campsite about 5 p.m. Monday bound for Jackson Lake, 1 1/2 miles 
away. On their return trip they ventured off the trail -- intentionally -- and 
became lost. By nightfall, Denham said, a "huge downpour" struck. 
</P>
<P>
The girls heard a helicopter at daybreak and hiked to a clearing where they 
could be seen, Denham said. Members of the department's volunteer search and 
rescue team found them at 7:15 a.m. near Inspiration Point, about a half-mile 
from the Angeles Crest Highway.

MONROVIA, Liberia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebel leader Prince Johnson, who holds several foreign hostages, said today 
that he will attack American Marines at the U.S. Embassy if U.S. or other 
foreign troops do not intervene to end Liberia's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
A group of West African countries meeting in Gambia announced today that they 
will send a joint military task force to Liberia, but they did not say when it 
would be mobilized. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 235 Marines airlifted into Monrovia to evacuate Americans and other 
foreign nationals on Sunday took up defensive positions within the walled U.S. 
Embassy compound after Johnson's threat. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also presented eight foreign hostages to reporters and said he would 
not free them until a peacekeeping force comes to this West African nation torn 
by a 7-month-old tribal conflict in which 5,000 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages shown included one American, identified as Chris Mendes, 27, a 
mining engineer from Sacramento; three Britons; two Germans; a Dutch national, 
and an Argentine. Johnson has pledged not to harm them, but said he would hold 
them until an outside force arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who killed a relief worker Friday who he said was selling rice to 
Monrovia's starving citizens, said he had killed one Liberian congressman for 
spying and would kill another. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages were abducted Monday night from Hotel Africa, on the northwestern 
outskirts of Monrovia.

<P>
Unemployment in East Germany almost doubled between June and July, official 
figures released today said. The West German official overseeing East Germany's 
businesses said the economy is in chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner Gohlke's remarks, published today in an East German newspaper, are some 
of the most ominous to date concerning the country's rapidly deteriorating 
economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
They coincided with the release of the latest official unemployment figures 
showing the number of East German jobless jumped to 272,017 last month, up from 
142,096 in June. 
</P>
<P>
More than 656,000 of the nation's 8.8 million workers are working short shifts 
because of the lack of demand for East German products. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, top-level meetings got under way in both Germanys to try to work 
out the precise date of German unity and the best means of stemming East 
Germany's escalating economic and social problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats -- the second-largest party in both Germanys -- have 
demanded unity by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But the Christian Democrats of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East 
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere insist unity must wait for all-German 
elections that should be held Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Since the West German mark became the East German currency on July 1, the 
country's 8,000 major businesses have faced increasing difficulties staying 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"The next six months will be the hardest," the newspaper Neue Zeit quoted 
Gohlke as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Gohlke is president of the Trust Institute of the German Democratic Republic. 
The institute was established to oversee the East German economy's change from 
a state-run economy to a capitalist system. 
</P>
<P>
There have been predictions that up to 4 million East Germans could be out of 
work by early next year as businesses close.

A farmer out for a morning walk near his fields captured two members of a 
"franchise" of the notorious Los Angeles-based Crips gang who were wanted in 
the shooting of a highway patrolman, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Belle Plaine farmer Ralph Wells and his wife, Rosemarie, were taking a Sunday 
stroll when they spotted a man hiding in a windbreak near their house. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, 39, said he had been aware of the shooting late Saturday night of State 
Trooper Edward Vohs. Vohs, who was listed in good condition today, was wounded 
in the chest after chasing a stolen car south of Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells thought that the incident occurred several miles from his farm and 
that the suspects were nowhere in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him and I thought he was just a poacher so I went and got my gun," Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While he retrieved his shotgun, Wells had his wife call the police, and then he 
noticed there were in fact not one man but two. 
</P>
<P>
"But I had my gun and the drop on them so I aimed my 20-gauge (shotgun) and 
said, 'You boys get out of my trees and hit the dirt,' " Wells said. "They 
cooperated real nice." 
</P>
<P>
Jamarrow Wright, 22, and his brother Jermaine, 18, of Wichita, were charged 
with aggravated battery against a law enforcement officer.

Officials of Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party went into hiding today, 
fearing arrest after her government's dismissal, and authorities ordered 
airports to bar PPP legislators from leaving the country, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, meanwhile, met with aides to discuss President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's 
actions Monday in dismissing her 20-month-old government, dissolving the 
National Assembly and declaring a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Ishaq Khan said he fired the government because of its "corruption and 
nepotism" and its failure to control escalating ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
International observers said the military is trying to regain control of 
Pakistan by having Bhutto dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Army contingents moved into the capital and took control of the Pakistan 
television headquarters, Radio Pakistan, the Information Ministry and several 
other government offices. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto said in a statement after today's meeting that the president had made 
"old and hackneyed charges, which have only one object -- to undermine the will 
of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The PPP is not afraid to face these charges. It is confident that if elections 
are held as promised, on schedule, it shall be vindicated in the court of the 
people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto later left Islamabad for her family home in the southern port of 
Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great, as I have done a good job," she told reporters. "The opposition 
parties have been brought into power through the back door as they had tried 
and failed to dislodge the PPP through all constitutional means." 
</P>
<P>
PPP sources said a number of the party's leaders have gone into hiding, fearing 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said authorities have issued to airport officials a list of 
prominent people, including PPP members of the National Assembly, whom they 
have barred from leaving the country. It was not known if Bhutto was also on 
the list.

Some of a crowd of more than 20,000 demonstrators protesting rises in food 
prices were briefly detained today after they scuffled with police outside 
Parliament, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers were organized by the Congress Party of former Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
Police and commandos armed with machine pistols and automatic rifles guarded 
the Parliament complex as members inside began a debate on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But outside, the Gandhi supporters shouted slogans calling for the resignation 
of Prime Minister V. P. Singh. 
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer then took a microphone and announced that the 
demonstrators were under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the protesters then scuffled with police, and they were briefly 
detained and released.

A handful of protesters took "umber-age" today, but it was out with the old and 
in with the new inside 64-color boxes of Crayola Crayons, the flip-top package 
that was the first status symbol for baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Crayola maker Binney &amp; Smith has created eight brighter colors and given 
them names like jungle green, wild strawberry and vivid tangerine. 
</P>
<P>
To make room, the company decided to ax eight classic but ho-hum colors so that 
the traditional sharpener-equipped boxes could be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
A ceremony this morning inducting the "retired" colors into the newly 
established Crayola Hall of Fame was picketed by about a dozen people who said 
they would miss maize, raw umber, lemon yellow, blue gray, violet blue, green 
blue, orange red and orange yellow. 
</P>
<P>
"Binney &amp; Smith, America takes umber-age," said one sign. "Indians call it 
maize, we call it gone," said another. 
</P>
<P>
New 5-foot-10 models of the retired colors stand in plastic tubes in front of 
Crayola's production center. Each has a plaque extolling the color's virtues. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll all miss these retired colors. That's why we started the Hall of Fame, 
so people can come by and see them whenever they want to," said Tom Muller, 
general manager of Binney &amp; Smith's Crayola division. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the list of new colors aimed at a fresh generation of children are 
dandelion, fuchsia, teal blue, royal purple and cerulean, a darker version of 
Crayola's sky blue.

RISING INTEREST RATES THREATEN HOME SALES; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: EMBARGO ON IRAQI OIL WILL LIKELY BOOST PRICES ON MOST GOODS, INCLUDING 
MORTGAGE RATES.

<P>
Sluggish home sales that had picked up lately as mortgage rates fell are under 
a new threat from rising interest rates resulting from the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait, analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The single factor that affects housing nationally is mortgage financing," said 
John A. Tuccillo, chief economist with the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Tuccillo and other economists said today that a worldwide embargo on oil from 
Iraq and occupied Kuwait will result in price increases for most goods, 
including a likely rise in mortgage rates of 0.25 to 0.50 percentage points in 
the near term. 
</P>
<P>
"If they go up 0.50 now and the thing is resolved in a few weeks, they will go 
down 0.50 and will continue going down," Tuccillo contended. "If the crisis 
lingers on . . . mortgage rates are going to go up and they'll stay up and 
housing's going to be in pretty bad shape." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Van Order, chief economist with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or 
Freddie Mac, said a 0.25-percentage-point increase in rates would result in an 
additional mortgage payment of $25 a month on a $100,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
According to weekly surveys by Freddie Mac, the average cost of a fixed-rate, 
30-year mortgage fell from its 1990 peak of 10.67% in May to 9.84% last Friday. 
The rates do not include add-on fees known as points. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors President Norman D. Flynn said that when mortgage rates began falling 
in May, buyers resumed house hunting, particularly in areas with relatively 
affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Commerce Department reported gains in new home sales during 
May and June after five consecutive monthly declines. 
</P>
<P>
And the Realtors said sales of existing homes, which represent about 80% of the 
housing market, posted a 1.2% increase in June. It was their first advance in 
seven months. 
</P>
<P>
But the decline in existing home sales in April and May resulted in a 0.5% drop 
in overall resales during the second quarter compared to the same period of 
1989, the Realtors said today. 
</P>
<P>
According to their most recent survey, second-quarter resales totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.68 million units, compared to 3.70 million 
units during the April-June period of last year. Sales dropped 2.7% from the 
first quarter to the second. 
</P>
<P>
By region, sales were off 14.5% to 650,000 units at an annual rate in the 
Northeast and 3.1% to 620,000 units in the West. Sales gained 4.4% to 1.41 
million units in the South and 4.2% to 990,000 units in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The Realtors said that in addition to rising mortgage rates, they were 
concerned over the effect of the government's sale of a large volume of 
properties in the Southwest that had been acquired from failed savings and 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
In their survey, the Realtors found the U.S. median price was $96,200, a 3.4% 
increase over the second quarter of 1990. The median price means half of the 
homes cost more, half less.

Harrods, London's luxury department store, today presented a new toothpaste for 
dogs that fights tooth decay and promises to give pets fresh breath. 
</P>
<P>
"Britain has nearly 7 million dogs, and their life expectancy is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
But often they have decaying teeth and gums, and their breath smells foul 
because they are fed on dog food that is soft," said Dr. Roger Mugford, an 
animal behaviorist. 
</P>
<P>
Mugford told reporters at the presentation of the new Petrodex toothpaste that 
he had tried the product out himself on a long-haired Irish setter and a 
short-legged Welsh corgi. "They loved the paste since it tastes malty," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that he would not venture to try to brush just any dog's teeth, 
saying: "I would think about it with a Rottweiler" -- a breed known for its 
sharp teeth.

Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter will spend two weeks in meetings with 
agricultural leaders of four Asian nations, including time in Japan to urge it 
to open its markets to U.S. rice, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan will be devoted to 
discussions of world trade reform, the new farm policy law being written by 
Congress and other agricultural issues. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter leaves Thursday for Japan to begin the tour. The U.S. rice industry 
gave him two symbolic bags of rice to carry on the trip to the island nation 
that bars virtually all imports of foreign rice. 
</P>
<P>
Asia buys 40% of U.S. agricultural exports. Japan is the No. 1 customer for 
U.S. farm goods and is forecast to buy $8.3 billion worth of them this fiscal 
year.

Stocks mostly moved lower in heavy and choppy activity today as traders reacted 
to Middle East developments. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.70 to 2,710.64. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 735 up, 838 down and 451 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 231.58 million shares, against 240.40 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index added 0.13 to 183.45. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index sagged 0.43 to 339.84. 
</P>
<P>
The panicky selling wave that engulfed Wall Street Monday, producing the worst 
performance since the "mini-crash" last October, subsided. 
</P>
<P>
But buyers failed to flock back to the market as pessmism prevailed in the face 
of an ailing economy, a rising inflation threat and the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Developments unfolding in the Mideast made the stock market reverse course 
several times. Traders appeared to pounce on each piece of news regarding the 
Iraq-Kuwait conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Word from the State Department in Washington that Iraq was increasing its troop 
readiness on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi Arabia increased the edginess in 
financial markets. A rumor, later denied, that Iraq had invaded Saudi Arabia 
temporarily incited heavy selling. 
</P>
<P>
The White House refused to comment on a report that the United States was 
beginning a major troop deployment in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Oil and related stocks were particularly sensitive to fluctuations in petroleum 
futures. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude 
settled at $28.31 a barrel, up 26 cents. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, foreign stock markets steadied, which helped restore calm in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The London stock market staged a partial rebound and the Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100-share index rose 15.6 points, or 0.7%, to 2,235.8. 
</P>
<P>
But in oil-dependent Japan, stocks continued to suffer. The 225-share Nikkei 
Stock Average dropped 946.46 points, or 3.31%, to close at 27,653.07. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chip stocks, which posted gains for most of the morning, abruptly reversed 
course and tumbled shortly before midday. Later, the Dow Jones average of 30 
industrial stocks bobbed up and down but never managed to move back into the 
plus column. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury bonds rebounded today following their biggest sell-off in nearly 
three years, one which stemmed from the rapid rise in oil prices and renewed 
inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers are also attracted to bargain prices on bonds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, for instance, fell more 
than 2 1/2 points, or $25 per $1,000 face amount, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
By midday today, it was up around 5/8 point, or $6.25. Its yield, which moves 
inversely to the price, eased to 8.74% from 8.80% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's rout was described as the biggest since just before the October, 1987, 
stock market crash, according to market observers.

The oldest Roman Catholic hospital on the West Coast will end 133 years of 
delivering babies in November. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's Hospital said it is closing down its obstetrics unit because it 
delivered fewer than 800 babies in the last year, although it was not losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals traditionally lose money when their number of births falls below 
1,200 a year. St. Mary's has been shifting emphasis toward heart surgery and 
orthopedic care. Both are more lucrative for a hospital than obstetrical care.

announced plans to make "The Adventures of Robin Hood" as a three-hour 
made-for-TV movie instead of a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
The studio suspended the project when it was learned that Morgan Creek 
Productions had signed Kevin Costner to "Prince of Thieves," a $40-million 
Robin Hood saga to be distributed sometime next year by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's TV movie, which is likely to air here before "Prince of Thieves" is 
released, will be distributed theatrically abroad.

Singer Janet Jackson postponed two concerts this week in Detroit after passing 
out backstage in the middle of a St. Louis show. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 24, collapsed Sunday after singing three songs. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to a hospital, treated for an acute viral infection and released, 
Kathleen Heinz, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Arena, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor recommended Jackson not perform for at least four or five days, Heinz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, the sister of Michael Jackson, has suffered from exhaustion during her 
"Rhythm Nation" tour and had come down with a fever and an ear infection that 
caused dizziness the day before she passed out, Heinz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit concerts had been scheduled for today and Wednesday but were moved 
to Aug. 22 and 23.

FRED ASTAIRE'S WIDOW SUES CBS RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: SHE CONTENDS THE FIRM UNDERPAYS ROYALTIES ON HER HUSBAND'S RECORDINGS 
AND THOSE OF OTHER ARTISTS.

<P>
Fred Astaire's widow sued CBS Records Inc., contending the firm provided false 
and incomplete royalty statements on sales of her husband's work. 
</P>
<P>
The breach-of-contract and commercial-appropriation lawsuit, filed Monday in 
Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that the world's second-largest record 
company underreports and underpays royalties to entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
"Reports such as these are not acceptable in other industries, and won't be 
tolerated here," said Thomas A. White, a Beverly Hills-based record industry 
consultant who manages the Astaire music assets. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records executives could not be reached in a telephone call made after 
business hours to seek comment. 
</P>
<P>
White said CBS Records' license to distribute the records has been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit demands return of an estimated 50 to 100 master recordings, 
including the soundtracks to such Astaire films as "Easter Parade," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Astaire albums sell hundreds of thousands of copies a year worldwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Astaire's widow, the former Robyn Smith, cites 
17 allegedly unfair business practices by CBS. It seeks at least $50,000 in 
damages and an injunction prohibiting CBS from selling Astaire's recordings.

LIZ SMITH: WHITNEY HOUSTON ON THE ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
WHITNEY HOUSTON, that young, gorgeous pop diva, has finally found a movie 
script that she is eager to do. Whitney turned down dozens in the past few 
years. She has now said yes to Tri-Star's screen version of the Terry McMillan 
novel "Disappearing Acts," from Pocket Books, a contemporary love story between 
a singer and a construction worker. It's certainly about time we had another 
major black female movie star. 
</P>
<P>
FLASH! Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson welcomed a 6-pound boy last Saturday in Los 
Angeles. Tom has two children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
FEAST or famine: That's the actor's life most of the time. Well, Kevin Conway, 
who made such an impression in the off-Broadway hit "Other People's Money," is 
truly feasting. Conway opens this week in the Ted Whitehouse play, "The Man Who 
Fell In Love With His Wife," at the Quaigh Theater in New York. His real-life 
wife, Mila Burnette, co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
The actor will also make his debut as a movie director when his film "The Sun 
and the Moon" opens at Joe Papp's Festival Latino in New York later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Conway has also just been signed by Disney for a two-picture deal, the first of 
which, "One Good Cop," starring Michael Keaton, starts shooting in New York on 
Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
SEVERAL MONTHS ago, when that "Designing Woman" Dixie Carter was setting New 
York on its ear with her cabaret act, she and I spoke of various things, among 
them, her hit CBS series and her wonderful co-stars, including the 
then-beleaguered Delta Burke. Dixie was affectionate and enthusiastic about 
everyone and everything on "Designing Women," including Delta, whose talent and 
beauty she praised. She was particularly incensed about the tabloid coverage of 
Delta's much-publicized battle with her weight. 
</P>
<P>
Now Delta has been nominated for an Emmy for the episode written especially for 
her that deals with society's attitude toward the overweight -- particularly if 
that overweight person happens to be a beautiful woman. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, on the heels of this triumph, Delta Burke has become embroiled 
in a war of words with producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. And from the bitter 
comments being flung about, it may be that Delta won't return to "Designing 
Women" as the femme fatale Suzanne Sugarbaker. 
</P>
<P>
As a fan of all the "DW's," I certainly hope this does NOT happen! "Designing 
Women" could survive without Delta, but her presence would be sorely missed, 
and, realistically, could Delta ever find such a marvelous role in any other 
series -- a character written expressly for her, so accommodating to both her 
talents and her real-life personality and problems? 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope cooler heads prevail.

"My hunger for making movies is over," said Richard Harris. "I'm almost 60. I'm 
rich. I prefer to do things for my own pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
The actor said he plans to spend the rest of his career working mainly on stage 
rather than film. 
</P>
<P>
The lanky, white-haired Irishman, who was homeless and hungry for some months 
in London as a young drama student, can now afford to pick and choose his 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
Draped in a bathrobe in his cluttered suite in London's Savoy Hotel, the 
57-year-old Harris said he plans to play major Shakespearean roles -- King 
Lear, Richard III and Shylock -- in London's West End over the next few years 
after his latest success there in Pirandello's "Henry IV." 
</P>
<P>
Harris says he prefers to work in the theater rather than film, but adds that 
he would do the occasional movie if the script were good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"On stage you have to start your role from scratch at 8 o'clock every night, 
and you've got the immediate response from the audience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But in Hollywood they're just interested in making money."

STEINBRENNER MEETING DELAYED; INTERIM VACANCY AT TOP SEEN

A meeting scheduled Wednesday between George Steinbrenner and his 18 limited 
partners has been postponed until next week due to an emergency family matter 
involving one of the partners. They are expected to approve his son, Hank 
Steinbrenner, as general partner at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The delay all but assures that the New York Yankees will operate without a 
full-time general partner for an interim period after George Steinbrenner 
resigns by Aug. 20. Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of 
baseball's Ownership Committee, said his group will not begin to examine Hank 
Steinbrenner's suitability as general partner until after the Yankees partners 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Kleinman, chief operating officer of the Yankees, said the club has not 
addressed how it will be run if Hank Steinbrenner is not approved by the time 
George Steinbrenner must step down. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," Kleinman said. "Nobody has discussed it at this time. 
There have been a number of things that have been addressed, but that is not 
one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent has said he will not postpone George Steinbrenner's 
sanctions. He has said he assumes the Yankees' "senior officers" will run the 
club on an interim basis.

One woman died today when a Japanese yacht racing in the Kenwood Cup capsized 
off the coast of Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 13 members of the all-female crew either swam to shore or were 
picked up by other boats shortly after the boat hit an underwater reef and 
capsized off Cape Halawa, Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead woman is a Japanese national, said Dr. Marion Hanlon, acting 
administrator at Maui Memorial Hospital. She was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was found unconscious in the yacht An by a Coast Guard search team 
and was brought to shore on Molokai, then airlifted to Maui Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The boat was taking part in a race between Honolulu and Molokai, one of a 
series of races making up the Kenwood Cup competition, race organizers said.

Citing high start-up costs, Triple-A Phoenix Firebirds owner Martin Stone says 
he probably will withdraw his bid for a major league baseball franchise, 
seriously setting back an effort to bring big-league baseball to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, a front-runner in Phoenix's effort to get a major league franchise, said 
he is "90%" certain he will withdraw his bid if he cannot persuade National 
League owners to reduce the $95-million franchise fee. 
</P>
<P>
Stone added that he is trying to arrange a meeting later this week with members 
of the league's expansion task force. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said he would have to pay an additional $40 million to $50 million in 
start-up costs, which would put the actual cost of beginning a franchise at 
$135 million to $145 million. 
</P>
<P>
The high start-up costs, Stone said, would make a new Phoenix franchise 
"economically not viable," because the Phoenix area could generate only $3 
million to $3.5 million a year in television and radio revenue. New York City 
can generate television revenue as high as $41 million, he said.
