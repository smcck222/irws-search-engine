India withdrew 875 more soldiers from Sri Lanka as President Ranasinghe 
Premadasa called a special Cabinet meeting to discuss negotiations for the 
withdrawal of all 45,000 Indian peacekeepers in the island nation. The two 
countries have been at loggerheads since Premadasa demanded that India withdraw 
troops dispatched two years ago to enforce an Indian-brokered peace accord to 
end a six-year insurgency by separatist Tamils fighting in northeast Sri Lanka. 
Meanwhile, the State Department expanded its notice to U.S. travelers in Sri 
Lanka to include the entire country, warning that there is a widespread 
potential for violence.

An exile Romanian human rights group in Paris said two ethnic Hungarians were 
beaten to death in the last two months by Romanian security agents. A spokesman 
for the League for Human Rights Defense in Romania said that Tamas Ianos, 42, 
was arrested May 23 at a Christian ceremony in Cluj province and was later 
killed by security agents, who interrogated him on how he obtained meat served 
at the ceremony. Tamas Imre, 38, was arrested in a bar in the town of Miercurea 
Ciuc on June 12 for ordering a drink in Hungarian and was later fatally beaten, 
the league said. Romania has previously been accused of violating the rights of 
its Hungarian minority.

Chinese peasants have clashed in more than 800 battles over resource-rich land 
since 1980, the official China Daily reported. Long, violent feuds over 
valuable land has caused "tens of thousands" of casualties, the report said. 
Most of the battles were in China's sparsely inhabited western provinces, where 
only provisional boundaries have been drawn to establish rights over forest and 
mineral resources, it added.

U.S. and Soviet officials ended the first round of nuclear arms negotiations 
under the Bush Administration on Monday without making progress on major 
disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever progress has been made does not involve, to my regret, solutions to 
major outstanding issues," chief Soviet negotiator Yuri K. Nazarkin told a news 
conference after a brief exchange of documents with his U.S. counterpart, 
Richard R. Burt. 
</P>
<P>
Burt took a more optimistic view in a separate news conference. "While there 
were no major breakthroughs, we achieved good, solid progress on a range of 
issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing defense policy for three months, President Bush decided to 
pursue broadly the same goals as the Reagan Administration in the talks, which 
are directed at finding an agreement on halving the superpowers' long-range 
nuclear arsenals to 6,000 warheads. 
</P>
<P>
After seven weeks of negotiations, much of the time devoted to understanding 
each other's positions, neither Burt nor Nazarkin was willing to predict when a 
strategic arms reduction (START) agreement could be signed. 
</P>
<P>
They said they have made some progress on issues that are not very divisive 
politically, such as the technically difficult concept of how to ensure that 
the other side is not cheating. 
</P>
<P>
The two most important areas of disagreement are whether to limit the number of 
sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) and whether an accord on long-range 
missiles should be linked to an agreement on space-based defenses such as the 
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). 
</P>
<P>
Nazarkin said "the problem of long-range SLCMs continues to be the most 
controversial." Washington says it is impossible to verify limits on these 
missiles, fitted to submarines roaming the seas. Moscow disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet ambassador said disagreement was so fundamental on "defense and 
space" that no improvements at all have been made on a draft text.

One hundred East Germans who took advantage of Hungary's dismantled border

Giessen city official Hans Haeuser said the refugees, leaving in two special 
cars of a train from Vienna on Monday night, will be housed in the main transit 
camp for East Germans in Giessen. 
</P>

In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the refugees had made their way to 
the West German Embassy in Vienna after Hungary removed its border fences with 
Austria. 
</P>

Since taking down the fences, Hungary has stepped up border patrols further 
inland to turn back East Germans trying to take advantage of the holes in the

MAJOR STEP TOWARD PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five Central American presidents have agreed on a plan to demobilize the 
U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The Bush 
Administration tried to block the accord, apparently more in a show of loyalty 
to its battlefield surrogates than in a serious effort to break up the peace 
process. But once Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo declared the deed done, 
the United States was left with only one option -- cooperating with efforts to 
disarm the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials had expected Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to 
push for a Contra demobilization plan at this past weekend's Central American 
summit meeting at the seaside resort town of Tela in Honduras. Before the 
summit, top U.S. officials traveled through the region urging the other four 
governments to resist Ortega's pleas. Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of 
state for inter-American affairs, put particular pressure on Honduras, which 
has provided the clandestine bases from which the Contras operate. He asked the 
Hondurans to let the Contras remain in their camps at least until elections are 
held in Nicaragua next February. Even President Bush weighed in, personally 
telephoning Azcona and Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias Sanchez, the 
architect of the Central American peace plan, to argue that an armed and ready 
Contra army is the only way to hold the Sandinistas to their promise that the 
Nicaraguan elections will be fair and free. 
</P>
<P>
But Ortega countered the pressure from Washington with something even more 
persuasive: an agreement calling for an end to the Contra war that was signed 
by 17 political parties who oppose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Ortega and 
other Sandinista leaders got the opposition groups to sign the statement by 
approving electoral reforms that opposition political leaders believe will make 
it easier to campaign against the Nicaraguan government before next February's 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
The willingness of the Nicaraguan opposition to publicly break with the Contras 
points up a dismal fact of Central American life that the Bush Administration 
-- and before it, the Reagan Administration -- has chosen to ignore in the 
debate over Nicaragua. Despite public-relations efforts to portray the Contras 
as "freedom fighters," the guerrilla forces have always had more support in 
Washington than they have in Nicaragua. All during the time that former 
President Reagan spent battling Congress over whether to fund the Contras, and 
what form that aid should take, there was a legitimate, peaceful opposition 
inside Nicaragua struggling to make itself heard. 
</P>
<P>
The Arias peace plan, with its emphasis on diplomacy and democratic elections 
in Central America, has given the Nicaraguan opposition a chance to assert 
itself, and now the Sandinistas' civilian opponents want a fair chance to beat 
them at the ballot box rather than on the battlefield. They are confident they 
can do so, especially considering the shambles the Sandinistas have made of 
Nicaragua's economy. But they know that the presence of a Contra army in the 
field does not help their cause, because it gives the government a villain on 
which to blame all of Nicaragua's problems and a symbol of yanqui 
interventionism with which to brand all opposition groups as traitors. With the 
Contras out of the picture, the elections, perhaps, can proceed unhampered -- 
though the Sandinistas' record of political blunders in the past has been 
destructive of the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
And what to do with the Contras, estimated to number 11,000 strong? The 
Administration should use the balance of the last allocation of aid to the 
rebels, $47.9 million, to begin a process of relocation in cooperation with the 
United Nations, which has already expressed a willingness to help end the 
fighting in Central America. Those rebels willing to return to Nicaragua should 
be allowed to do so, with no fear of persecution. Their rights should be 
guaranteed by the U.N., the United States and all five Central American 
governments as a precondition to their repatriation. Those Contras who would 
prefer to leave for other countries also deserve help. It is likely that many 
will opt for the United States, where exile communities have already been 
established in cities like Los Angeles and Miami. Administration officials 
should welcome them, just as this country took in the Cuban veterans of the 
failed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. That is the least Washington owes them for 
their efforts on the battlefield.

In response to "Six Democrats Backing Capital Gains Tax" (Part I, July 25): 
</P>
<P>
I do not see this as a partisan issue, nor should it be played as a Bush vs. 
Foley issue. Certainly it is not an "unnecessary giveaway to the rich." 
</P>
<P>
As a retired middle-class professional in my 60s, I would like to sell my house 
(purchased in 1972) and move to a less expensive area. I have not done so 
because of unjust, high capital gains tax. I'm sure there are many, many people 
in my position. 
</P>
<P>
It has been demonstrated that it would generate revenue by encouraging many 
people like myself to sell.

DEBATE OVER CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democrats have lost the last two presidential elections because they have 
lost touch with those whose votes they need to win an election (the 
middle-class American.) 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats presently are against a proposed reduction in the capital gains 
tax as it will only benefit the rich and the upper class. Why don't the 
Democrats propose a reduction in the capital gains tax that will benefit most 
Americans in one way or another? Why not treat interest income as capital gains 
and then the reduction in the capital gains tax will affect every American who 
has money in a bank account, etc? 
</P>
<P>
I see no reason why a person, rich or poor, should be penalized for saving 
money and have to pay a high rate of tax on the low rate of interest earned on 
the money. One reason that Americans do not save money is they earn 6% to 9% 
interest and after taxes their return is from 4% to 6%. When Americans do not 
save money, we then have to keep our interest rates high so that foreigners 
will deposit money in our financial institutions and purchase T-bills, etc. 
Therefore, if we can encourage saving by lowering the tax rate on interest 
income (by considering it a capital gain) we may also very well lower the 
interest rate we have to pay to borrow money.

'CREDENTIAL TEACHERS?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a potential nominee for becoming a member of the National Board of 
Professional Teaching Standards, I applaud your editorial "Credential 
Teachers?" (July 31). As a teacher for nearly 20 years, I personally face the 
future everyday in my high school classroom. Thus your statement that teachers 
hold one of the most important jobs in this country is not only indicative of 
your continued support for education, but also increases the value of what we 
teachers do for our society. 
</P>
<P>
If the teaching profession is going to command the image and respect accorded 
other professions, we must have a certification program that not only tests for 
subject knowledge, but also for how effective we are in relating to students. I 
have seen teachers with a limited subject knowledge imbue within their students 
an intense desire for learning and understanding while, on the other hand, 
there are some teachers with a profound understanding for their subject who 
fail to impart that great knowledge upon their students. The trick is to find 
individuals who can do both effectively . . . especially for the future of our 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Times' Sports Section columnist Jim Murray wrote that no wonder, 
as a society, we find foreign goods and services better than those made in this 
nation when we allow our educational systems to disintegrate. At least the 
Carnegie Forum is taking steps to alleviate the severe future shortage of 
qualified teachers so that our nation will enter the next century prepared to 
meet those future scientific and technological challenges.

VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not only an honor but a sacred trust to have the power to make daily 
decisions that affect the lives of every American. Each time we go to the polls 
we vote for our chosen representatives as "our voice" in our government, and so 
endow those individuals with the awesome authority to speak for us. But since 
we don't receive daily memos from them as to what's transpiring in the meeting 
rooms of our nation's Capitol, nor do we have box seats at Senate debates, we 
rarely know what legislation has been proposed, enacted or repealed until it is 
a fait accompli. So, it is with a deep sense of shock and outrage to hear of a 
proposed bill (S-874), which calls for "instant voter registration" -- a plan 
to automatically register people to vote when they renew their driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sponsor of this "motor-voter" bill, Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.), 
"It will remove obstacles from voter registration and encourage more people to 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
Surely at a time when fake IDs are as easily purchased as a box of Cracker Jack 
by illegal aliens and others who have ulterior motives for possessing them, the 
intelligence and motives of the sponsor and endorsers of this legislation must 
be seriously questioned. 
</P>
<P>
To allow such irresponsible and dangerous legislation to go unchallenged is to 
open the door to "voting by phone" or even total abolishment of the need to 
register.

POLITICAL LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip Dunne's excellent column "Pinning Down Political Labels" (Editorial 
Page, July 29) pointed out the semantic absurdities going about these days. 
Preposterous people, such as James Watt, are being described by equally 
preposterous -- and tortured -- phrases, "radical conservative," for one. 
</P>
<P>
A solution to this, it seems to me, would be the revival of a word which seems 
to have vanished, without a trace, from the American political vocabulary, 
namely: reactionary. It is not an epithet. It is a simple, direct, description 
of a political viewpoint. Its return to our language would spare us the 
absurdities and euphemisms which now irritate us. 
</P>
<P>
Calling James Watt, Jesse Helms, and others too numerous to mention, 
"conservatives" (no matter how you qualify the word) is about as accurate as 
calling Hitler a troublemaker.

MORNING BRIEFING: ALI REMEMBERS THE COLORS, BUT NOT 10-YEAR-OLD TYSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali appeared on Arsenio Hall's show last week, the 
New York Times said Tyson revealed that when he was 10 years old and doing time 
in a Bronx detention center, Ali visited the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he didn't get to meet Ali. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get close to him," Tyson said. "I was one of the troublemakers in 
the back." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember you," Ali said. "You were the one in the brown pants and the yellow 
shirt." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, wow." Hall said, marveling at Ali's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had brown pants and yellow shirts," Tyson said. "It was the 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Out of the dark: Tackle Harris Barton of the San Francisco 49ers, asked to 
compare new Coach George Seifert to Bill Walsh, told the Oakland Tribune: 
"George is a players' coach. Bill was like Darth Vader. You never knew what he 
was thinking. He was always watching you. There were so many things he was 
particular about, like keeping your shirt tucked in, not cussing. There was a 
definite dark side there. 
</P>
<P>
"George, though, is really pleasant. We don't have to be scared walking through 
the hallways limping. This is definitely a different feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In what ballpark did the Los Angeles Dodgers open the 1958 season 
after moving west from Brooklyn? 
</P>
<P>
Flip side: William Drozdiak of the Washington Post said that Danny Ferry will 
enjoy a lot of advantages playing in Italy, but warned: "When you play away 
games against gritty little teams in Sardinia, where the entire village is 
poised to celebrate for a week if the local team can beat Rome and its 
million-dollar American, be prepared for nothing short of guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"Referees will be cowed into whistling you for fouls if you come close to 
breathing on an opponent. Maniacal fans have been known to heat up 100-lira 
coins with their cigarette lighters and toss them at the American star. When 
the crowd runs out of change, burning cigars and cigarettes may rain down on 
you -- especially if you are causing their team to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Quick now, who holds the New York Yankee record for 
most steals of home in a career? Would you believe the Iron Horse? Yes, it's 
Lou Gehrig, with 15. Maybe even more surprising, Babe Ruth had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ho-hum: From Tom Friend of the Washington Post, trying to explain the 
infrequent appearances of Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke at league meetings: 
"Apparently they bore him. League officials remember the year he attended one 
morning session in New York and owners haggled over whether to fine teams if 
their players didn't pull up their socks -- then left in a huff. As it turned 
out, he bought the Chrysler Building that afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Need a license?: Ellis Clary, Toronto Blue Jays' scout, on the size of the new 
SkyDome: "It's big enough for deer hunting." 
</P>
<P>
Add Clary: According to the Chicago Sun-Times, he once gave this scouting 
report on Ryne Sandberg: "I found his weakness. He can't slide into the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Seals Stadium in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Longtime minor league manager Rocky Bridges, asked if he had reached 
his potential: "I may have gone beyond it."

ART BUCHWALD: THE DOG DAYS OF VACATION REAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past the vacation conversation around the guacamole dip bowl had to do 
with the killing everyone could make selling their second home. Prices have 
skyrocketed in the last few years, and houses we had bought 15 years ago for 
$30,000 were now selling for $2 million. Most of us credited the surge in our 
paper profits to our ability to know when to buy and how long to hold on. It 
was a talent that only a few of us, like Donald Trump and Harry Helmsley, 
seemed to have. As Donald Rappaport, our local tycoon, used to say, "The secret 
of investing is to buy low and sell high." Wisdom like this made us all listen 
when Rappaport spoke. 
</P>
<P>
But this year it's different. The real estate market is not only flat, it has 
tumbled and is now in the basement. Homes that originally were built for 
$64,000 are now selling for a measly $350,000. There are horror stories 
everywhere. Guggenheim built a lean-to on the pond in 1970 for $14,000, and 
when he put it on the market this year all he was offered was $150,000. This 
took place at the very moment that President Bush denied there was a recession. 
</P>
<P>
You can imagine the nervousness around the guacamole dip bowl about how much 
our homes are now worth. 
</P>
<P>
Payette said, "I can't believe that while I'm standing here the price of my 
$75,000 New Bedford ranch house has sunk from $750,000 to a half-million. What 
did I do wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Hawk the lawyer said: "You didn't do anything wrong. Your real estate is still 
worth as much as it was last year. The only trouble is nobody wants to buy it 
anymore. People are just sitting on their hands waiting for you to get 
desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport was ready to speak, and we, of course, deferred to him. "We are in a 
period of nervousness and doubt. The reason the prices on our homes have slid 
so badly is that Tokyo still hasn't made up its mind about the dollar, while 
Gorbachev has. I'm convinced as soon as the Swiss dwarfs do something, we will 
see a boom in vacation houses that will blow the Bank of England's mind. Of 
course, it will depend on whether Gov. Dukakis ever figures out what's up and 
what's down in his budget." 
</P>
<P>
As usual Rappaport was making a lot of sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you suggesting we hold on to our homes until we see how the Common Market 
is going to work?" 
</P>
<P>
"That goes without saying. We must look fore and aft to interpret the violent 
swings of the real estate fluctuation -- west to South Korea and east to 
Hungary. By watching their real estate prices we can get some idea of what to 
expect with our homes on Cape Cod." 
</P>
<P>
The group around the guacamole dip bowl had to admit that we had never dreamed 
that someday we would all lose our shirts in the market. "What happened to the 
American dream?" Wallace wanted to know as he stuffed his mouth full of potato 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
Durr said: "It's the crooks in Washington helping the savings and loan crooks 
that put us in this position. We homeowners are nothing more than pawns of 
bankers who live in overpriced homes in Southampton." 
</P>
<P>
Then Hawk raised a very interesting question. "If the price went up tomorrow on 
your homes, would any of you sell?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you crazy?" Durr replied. "Where would we live?" 
</P>
<P>
"If the price went down even further, would anyone sell?" 
</P>
<P>
It was so quiet you could hear Rappaport's whale pants flapping in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"So why do we care if our houses go up or down?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because," Ware said, "when you are on vacation it's very comforting to talk 
about money."

BOOK REVIEW;

<P>
PICKING THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THE MYSTERIES OF THE MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neuro-: Life on the Frontlines of Brain Surgery and Neurological Medicine by 
David Noonan (Simon and Schuster: $19.95; 233 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The human brain is the most distinguishing part of our body, the most 
fascinating, and probably the least understood. Unlike the other organs, the 
brain's product -- mind -- cannot be directly observed. The pancreas secretes 
insulin; does the brain secrete thoughts? If so, where are they? 
</P>
<P>
The link between brain and mind is very poorly understood. Yet doctors who 
treat the brain organically -- neurologists and neurosurgeons -- are frequently 
able to help their patients. "Neuro-" by David Noonan is the story of who they 
are and how they do it. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan, a Los Angeles writer, approaches his subject from the doctors' point of 
view and from the patients'. The chapters on brain surgery and brain surgeons 
are the best. To do research for them, he interviewed the surgeons and observed 
them at work. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The brain exposed. Light falls on its gleaming surface for the first time. It 
beats lightly, steadily. It is pink and gray, the brain, and covered with tiny 
blood vessels, in a web. In some openings you can see the curve of the brain, 
its roundness. It does not look strong, it looks very soft, soft enough for you 
to push your finger through. When you see it for the first time, you almost 
expect sparks arcing across the surface of the cortex, blinking lights, the 
crackle of an idea. You stare down at it, and it gives nothing back, reveals 
nothing, gives no hint of how it works." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident Practitioners 
</P>
<P>
The reader learns that practitioners in this field are supremely confident of 
their knowledge and their skills and their ability to make the right decisions 
in difficult situations. "Brain surgeons cut people's heads open," Noonan 
writes. A simple but startling statement. 
</P>
<P>
He has great affection and admiration for these doctors who do this work, and 
that comes through loud and clear. He is also aware of the difficult and 
unusual position that doctors -- particularly surgeons -- are in. Noonan is 
very perceptive about this. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons must care about their patients, but they cannot become emotionally 
involved with them. The patient's condition is part of the job, and it must 
always remain part of the job: 
</P>
<P>
"What is all new and strange to the patients and his family is old and familiar 
to the surgeon," Noonan writes. "The patient rightly considers his brain tumor 
to be the most important brain tumor that ever existed, while the doctor knows 
that the patient's brain tumor is one of many a doctor will have to confront 
over the course of his career." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neurological Problems 
</P>
<P>
While the first half of the book deals with doctors and patients and the 
relationship between the two, the second half deals in detail with three 
serious neurological problems: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's 
disease), which affects movement; aphasia, which affects speech, and 
schizophrenia, which affects thought. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the book is less successful than the first. It has a padded 
feeling. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease, for example, contains an extended 
discussion of Lou Gehrig's baseball career. The chapter on schizophrenia 
includes a seemingly endless diatribe against frontal lobotomies, which were 
extensively performed in this country from 1935 to 1960 as a treatment for 
mental illness. These chapters are more descriptions of diseases than "life on 
the frontlines of brain surgery and neurological medicine," which, after all, 
is the subtitle of the book. 
</P>
<P>
But they do have some value. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease includes a 
profile of Lance Meagher, a physician who has lived with ALS for 13 years and, 
though virtually paralyzed, continues in limited practice and is making plans 
to fly solo around the world. Meagher is probably the most interesting person 
Noonan presents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing the Soul 
</P>
<P>
At the very end of the book, in a short chapter appropriately titled 
"Conclusion," Noonan voices his only reservations about the doctors who work on 
the brain. By restricting their activity to the flesh, he says, they are 
missing the soul. Doctors treat the body but not the mind. Emotions are more 
than the sum total of complicated electrochemical firings in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Noonan says, "love is a chemical reaction, but there is more to it than 
that. There is, I believe, something beyond biology, and it is a factor, 
somehow, in the function of every living human cell and in every human thought 
and deed. In a sense, the human nervous system is a complex set of conditions 
necessary for the existence of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
This assertion, on the book's penultimate page, comes out of the blue. It does 
not follow from what has come before, and Noonan has hardly raised the 
question, much less prepared the reader for his conclusion.

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;

<P>
MILLER'S LIFE BEHIND THE 'STRETCH MARKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Miller is, of course, an egotist. It goes with the territory in performance 
art. In fact, it goes with the territory in art. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional artist, however, uses a mask to take the curse off his 
self-involvement. The hero of "This Side of Paradise" isn't F. Scott 
Fitzgerald, it's "Amory Blaine." "I know myself," says Amory at the age of 30, 
"but that is all." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who turned 30 last year, gives us Tim Miller straight up. His pieces 
constitute an ongoing autobiography, the latest chapter of which opened over 
the weekend at Highways in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"Stretch Marks" is the title, by which Miller means those little folds that one 
starts to notice after 30, not to mention the first few gray hairs. The golden 
boy is starting to feel flawed. 
</P>
<P>
The title also suggests the birth process, which our hero feels continually in 
the middle of, like a baby hurtling down the canal. Some of the best sequences 
in the piece suggest a man on a talking jag -- if he says the words fast 
enough, maybe he'll be able to discern the meaning of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
The tempo also suggests the rush of a passing train, one of the evening's 
recurrent images. Planes are another obsession. Miller straps a paper 747 to 
his arms and becomes a Daedalus (Stephen Daedalus?) who is panicked to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Death in Venice" is another source of imagery. Miller's bathing suit suggests 
Tadzio on the strand, but he is beginning to feel like Aschenbach, what with 
all the death around these days. 
</P>
<P>
Between arias, Miller simply converses, at normal speed and pitch. He is a good 
story teller. Sometimes a serious silence falls on the room, the highest 
tribute an actor can get. At other times -- the airline routine -- we're more 
lightly held. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also is a dancer, or at least a movement-person. He stretches on a 
vertical beach, achieves an epiphany of sorts with an unattached toilet seat 
and shinnies up a rope to perch on the steel girder over the stage. 
</P>
<P>
At no point does he suggest a wild man. As he keeps reminding us (another 
leitmotif), this is a nice boy from Whittier. His provenance and his 
temperament create something of a problem for Miller as an artist. He is 
submitting his life to us as a "found object." And no one would deny that he 
has had interesting experiences, that he has made important breakthroughs -- 
here, the decision to really make some noise about the lousy treatment that the 
county gives its AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
However, Miller doesn't have the skill of a born eccentric -- Spalding Gray, 
say -- to turn every moment in his life into an adventure. For example, he 
tells a long story about the summer he studied German with a woman who was 
actually, wow, a Latina. Somehow we aren't as blown away by the paradox as 
Miller is. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Miller recalls swapping stories with two people in a railroad dining 
car. Theirs are from real life, and Miller tells them beautifully. His is a 
fantasy, and it's a comedown. 
</P>
<P>
Not, of course, from his point of view. Like Whitman, he celebrates himself, 
and we can enjoy the ardor with which he does it. The Pacific Ocean, he tells 
us, isn't just any ocean -- it's the ocean beside which he first kissed another 
boy. There is the slight suggestion that a plaque on the site would not be 
amiss. 
</P>
<P>
After 30, this sort of narcissism gets problematic. There are signs in "Stretch 
Marks" that Miller is starting to kid it. At other moments, he seems determined 
to hang onto it, as if it were the thing that made him unique. Time will tell. 
</P>

Look for "Ghostbusters II" to be available in the home video market by 
Christmas. The word Monday from RCA/Columbia at the eighth annual Video 
Software Dealers convention in Las Vegas is that the hit film will hit the 
market in the fourth quarter of this year, possibly by Thanksgiving. The 
expected price tag: around $90. "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" is also headed for 
the video shelves about the same time. Convention delegates now are awaiting 
word from Warner Bros. as to when "Batman" might be available in video form. An 
announcement could be made Wednesday at a Warner-hosted luncheon. ALEENE

When "Oh! Calcutta!" cast members put on their clothes and went home after 
Sunday night's performance in New York, it marked the close of what has been 
billed as "the world's longest-running erotic stage musical." The show, born of 
the 1960s era of "free love," ended with its 5,959th performance. The revue 
opened Off-Broadway on June 17, 1969 and has moved to several New York theaters 
since then. There were 10 in the cast then. The final performance had eight in 
the opening number, "Taking Off the Robe," and 11 in the finale as a few alumni 
returned for a final scamper in white robes and birthday suits. With the 
5,832th Broadway performance of "A Chorus Line" this weekend -- it opened a few 
months earlier but has had a less-intensive schedule -- "Oh! Calcutta!'s" mark 
is expected to fall this fall. ALEENE MacMINN

The first winners of the Praemium Imperiale, a new international prize for 
lifetime contribution to the arts and intended to compare to the Nobel Prize in 
purpose and scope, will be announced at a Sept. 15 luncheon in New York. The 
Japan Art Assn., sponsor of the prize, said Monday that prizes of $100,000 each 
will be awarded in five fields: architecture, music, theater and film, painting 
and sculpture, areas not represented by the Nobel Prize. The announcement 
luncheon will be hosted by David Rockefeller, the North American representative 
of a blue-ribbon International Committee of Advisers that nominated candidates 
for the Praemium Imperiale to the Japan Art Assn. The other advisers are 
Jacques Chirac, former prime minister of France; Amintore Fanfani, former prime 
minister of Italy; Edward Heath, former prime minister of Great Britain, and 
Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. The 1989 
winners will get their awards at an Oct. 27 ceremony in Tokyo.ALEENE MacMINN

Rock star Billy Joel, who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away 
his rights to his early songs, gives this advice to newcomers in the field: 
"Get a lawyer . . . then hire another lawyer to watch the first lawyer. There's 
a great deal of dishonesty and greed, and musicians tend to be naive about this 
business." Joel made the comment during an appearance at a master class at Long 
Island University's Southampton campus. ALEENE MacMINN

JOHN WILLIAMS LEADS BOSTON POPS ESPLANADE AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By -- JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an unwarranted stigma attached to the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra. 
It is, as the program book Sunday evening at the Hollywood Bowl reminded us, 
composed of "other Boston-based musicians" rather than the Boston Symphony 
stalwarts who make up the real Boston Pops. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't tell that from the performance, however. This was a tight, 
hard-hitting band that played its pops with spirited conviction and skill. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concert was the finale of an 11-city, cross-country tour, there 
was nothing tired or routine in the playing. John Williams guided the orchestra 
in a program devoted largely to music from movies and musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Williams dispensed with the National Anthem, initiating instead an evening of 
brass heroics with his own Olympic Fanfare and Theme. Other Williams 
contributions were two characterful, lovely and almost understated pieces from 
his 20-year-old score for "Jane Eyre," the love theme from "The Accidental 
Tourist" and more predictable hits from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "E.T." 
</P>
<P>
Three big medleys -- a group of tunes from Fred Astaire films, a four-item Duke 
Ellington tribute and a train-theme set -- dominated the second half of the 
program. There were times when it all began to sound the same, through the 
high-calorie, overachieving orchestrations, but all sections of the orchestra 
had opportunities to strut their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The audience response was overwhelming. Relatively few of the 15,151 left 
early. Most stood and stamped and cheered, eventually drawing Williams out for 
four encores. -- JOHN HENKEN

 KLON'S BLUE NOTE CELEBRATION HAS ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting a little late (the promoters were no doubt waiting for a larger crowd 
that failed to show), the first of three concerts in KLON-FM's celebration of 
the Blue Note Records semicentennial got under way at the John Anson Ford 
Theatre on Sunday afternoon beneath a blazing sun. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Peterson, the drummer-composer whose quintet played the opening set, 
displayed an adventurous musicality in his writing, which leans to odd meters 
("Monief" was in alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8), tempos that slow down and 
speed up, and structures that are asymmetrical, as in the first piece, "Enemy 
Within." This was notable mainly for the piano solo by Geri Allen, whose power 
and sensitivity are the group's most valuable element. 
</P>
<P>
The most accessible piece was a blues, "Bebopskerony," with fine work by the 
cornetist Graham Haynes (son of the drummer Roy Haynes) and saxophonist Greg 
Osby. Phil Bowler is an admirable bassist, but Peterson's explosive drumming 
rendered him inaudible much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Note All-Stars was composed of eight musicians who, somewhere along 
the way (in most cases decades ago), recorded for the label. They played a 
major and a minor blues, a somewhat ragged ballad medley in which the 
innovative impulses of trumpeter Charles Tolliver and trombonist Curtis Fuller 
seem to have been dulled by the heat, and a few bop standards to which pianist 
Walter Bishop Jr., guitarist Tal Farlow and alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson 
applied their veteran chops. 
</P>
<P>
James Moody broke it up with his "Moody's Mood for Love" vocal and was at his 
creative, pulsating peak on tenor sax. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, in a half-full 1,300-seat theater, ground to a halt when Wayne 
Shorter's 5 p.m. set failed to start; his musicians could not be found. Because 
of a 6 p.m. curfew, his projected hourlong set was, predictably, shorter. At 
5:25 he began playing in duo format with pianist Mitch Forman; at 5:30 the 
bassist and drummer, John Patitucci and Terri Lyne Carrington, were setting up 
on stage while Shorter's soprano wailed its way through "Stella by Starlight." 
</P>
<P>
What there was of the Shorter Quartet had some valuable moments, particularly 
during his best-known piece, "Footprints," but it was too little and too late. 
One can only hope that the next two Sunday concerts, with a strong lineup of 
names, including Art Blakey, Bobby Hutcherson and Horace Silver, will be better 
attended and organized.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'COMRADES' AND 'BLOW BY BLOW' IN UCLA KARMITZ SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA Film Archives series "Marin Karmitz and MK2" focuses on one of 
France's most prestigious producers and his company. A longtime political 
activist, the Romanian-born Karmitz began as a film maker, and his 
three-weekend retrospective opens with two films he directed himself: 
"Comrades" (1970), which screens Saturday at UCLA's Melnitz Theater at 8 p.m., 
and "Blow for Blow" (1972), screening Sunday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Few film makers, even the most serious and challenging, deal with the central 
role of work in our lives. For this reason alone, "Comrades" and "Blow for 
Blow" are valuable and involving, although the second is the far more 
accomplished work. 
</P>
<P>
Both deal with factory workers rebelling against harsh and exploitative 
conditions. In the first, a pleasant young man, a high-school dropout 
(Jean-Paul Giquel), resists a life in the shipyards of his native St. Nazaire 
and eventually heads for Paris with the hope of finding office work, only to 
end up on a factory assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Karmitz has a vital, easy style and a fine sense of image and tempo, all of 
which makes it lamentable that in his film's final half-hour he lapses into 
long-winded preachiness involving his hero's political indoctrination. We are 
even treated to a tedious documentary on how a group of Argentinian workers 
have gone about organizing themselves. He ends the film with a salute to 
communism, endorsing its policy of the violent overthrow of government, a 
sentiment that he might find naive and passe today. 
</P>
<P>
Although made only two years later, "Blow for Blow" is a better film in every 
way. He centers on a large group of women who feel they have no choice but to 
toil as garment workers in what is the only factory in their provincial town in 
central France. Supervised strictly by a severe-looking woman, the workers are 
not allowed to socialize in any way. The emphasis is entirely on output, so 
much so that it's hard to believe that the film is set in the present -- i.e., 
France in the early '70s -- and not at the turn of the century or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the workers revolt, occupying the factory and striking for higher 
pay, shorter hours and better working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The women, many of whom are actual workers, are an earthy, humorous, 
no-nonsense lot, and one of the film's pleasures is watching them becoming 
acquainted with each other at last and achieving a lively sense of solidarity. 
"Blow for Blow" resists the didacticism of "Comrades" and it has a feminist 
spirit that makes it seem timelier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Both films, however, are notable in the way in which they point up the folly of 
greed. All the policies that tend to dehumanize the workers, exploiting them to 
the hilt, actually work against achieving productivity instead of ensuring it. 
In both film we witness human beings resisting becoming mere machines. 
</P>
<P>
"Blow for Blow" will be followed by Yilmaz Guney's "The Wall," which is set in 
Turkey but was shot in France in 1982 for Karmitz's MK2 production company. It 
was the first film the long-imprisoned and finally exiled Guney, considered 
Turkey's greatest director, had been able to direct since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
It is a beautifully crafted picture, in which a terrible prison becomes the 
symbol of present-day Turkey and which concentrates on the plight of some 
teen-age boys held there. As fine as it is, it really offers nothing new and 
therefore becomes punishing to experience. Tragically, Guney, who is best-known 
for that bleakest of masterpieces, "Yol," gained his freedom and resumed 
directing only to die of stomach cancer in September, 1984, at 47.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY URGES DEATH FOR KILLER OF 3 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica Superior Court jury recommended Monday that a former television 
cameraman die in the gas chamber for the 1984 murders of three Westside women. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 1/2 days of deliberation, the panel of seven women and five men 
recommended that Dean Phillip Carter be executed at San Quentin State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The same jury last month convicted Carter, 33, on three counts of murder, two 
counts of rape and two counts of burglary in the string of assaults in April, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, the son of a former police and fire chief in Nome, Alaska, was 
convicted of killing Culver City roommates Jillette L. Mills, 24, and Susan 
Lynn Knoll, 33, and their friend, Bonnie Ann Guthrie, 24, of West Los Angeles. 
Mills and Guthrie were also raped. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was earlier convicted and sentenced to 56 years in prison for the March 
29, 1984, rape and attempted strangulation of a 22-year-old Ventura County 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
He still faces murder charges in Alameda and San Diego counties.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE DAMAGES 2 BUILDINGS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire broke out in an abandoned commercial building south of downtown Los 
Angeles on Monday night and spread to an adjacent newspaper distribution 
facility owned by The Times, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began in the building scheduled for demolition about 8 p.m. and was 
controlled about two hours later, Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty engine companies and two helicopters fought flames that caused the north 
wall of the three story commercial building in the 1000 block of East 6th 
Street to collapse and crash through the roof of The Times' Center 8 
distribution center, Times Security Officer Michelle Horeczko said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the wall went down, flames gushed out and came through from next door. It 
burned like hell," said Don Buckland, a Times security supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Horeczko said that the distribution building is used from early morning hours 
until dusk and that no employees were at the site when the fire broke out. 
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators had not determined the origin of the blaze.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LOANS TO MEET SMOG RULES ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community Development Department will make available economic 
development loans to help small businesses struggling to comply with new 
regional air pollution regulations. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Monday, Mayor Tom Bradley and City Councilman Robert 
Farrell said they fear many small manufacturers will go out of business unless 
they receive financial help in installing pollution devices that are required 
under a sweeping 20-year plan for the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say 300 of these manufacturers are in the city of Los Angeles, 
and many employ low-income minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has begun adopting rules 
affecting furniture makers, bakeries, dry cleaners and other small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The rules call for reducing emissions of hydrocarbons and other pollutants by 
as much as 80% over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has directed the Community Development Department to establish a 
business hot line for information about the pollution requirements and funding 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses can apply for up to $82.5 million in economic development loans 
administered by the city.

AL MARTINEZ: EXIT THE CLOWNS, CRYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When comedy writer Martin Ragaway was dying of cancer last April and unable to 
speak, he wrote a note that said, "Game's over, we all lose." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed a bitter little punch line to a life that had been given over to 
laughter, and I wondered why he had written that. 
</P>
<P>
Not that I expected the man to be up telling jokes a few hours before his 
death. But I had known Ragaway fairly well and the last note did not fit my 
image of him. 
</P>
<P>
I began calling others who knew him better, among them Bill Larkin. Larkin and 
Ragaway had worked for Bob Hope for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Larkin why Ragaway would write something like that, and he said he 
really didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem like Marty," he said. "He was always up. His only goal in life 
was to entertain. But maybe being up and entertaining just covered his real 
attitude. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Comedy writers, he said, laughing, were skewed people. You couldn't predict 
what they'd do. 
</P>
<P>
Then Larkin proved his point. Not then, last Thursday. He went down into the 
garage of his Marina del Rey apartment and shot himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ragaway all over again, in a way. The last time I saw Martin he was as 
funny and strange as ever. I didn't realize it then, but he had terminal 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
When I talked to Larkin after Ragaway's death, he was funny and strange too, 
but maybe a little more reflective about humor masking personal anguish. 
</P>
<P>
That was last April. Larkin, who was 68, had been planning his own death even 
then, for essentially the same reasons Ragaway wrote that bitter epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
For all their immense talent to make others laugh, comedy would not work for 
its gifted creators. The clowns left the stage crying. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin began composing a suicide note in 1986 and finally left it last week for 
a friend, Nan Burrows. He had a heart problem and other ailments, and could no 
longer taste or smell food. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so goddamn sick of feeling 98% dead that I really want to die," he wrote. 
"I am lonely but no longer have the patience to be around people. I always say 
I feel fine. People aren't interested in how you feel and I don't blame them. 
Sick people are boring." 
</P>
<P>
Then he wrote, "While I've had a wonderful life and have done so much more than 
I have ever dreamed of doing, it's now over. I no longer serve any function. 
There is no reason for me to exist." 
</P>
<P>
This is a comedy writer? 
</P>
<P>
"He was so depressed," writing partner Mort Lachman said of his friend, "but 
you never knew it to talk to him. When Marty Ragaway died, Billy spoke at his 
funeral. He was hilarious and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"Later at lunch I said, 'Where'd you get all that stuff on Marty? I don't 
remember all that.' Billy said, 'He never did all those things. I made them up. 
I had to do something nice for the guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Larkin was an air traffic controller for the Santa Monica and Bakersfield 
airports when he began writing comedy in the late 1940s. He loved the Steve 
Allen radio show and sent in jokes. Allen liked them so much, he hired Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
His credits since then cover two typewritten pages. They include television 
shows, movies, books, night club acts and even speeches for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Lachman was looking for a writing partner and his agent suggested that 
he have lunch with Larkin. Later, the agent asked Lachman what he thought and 
Mort said, "Well, he eats good." 
</P>
<P>
They became a writing team closer than most marriages, not only traveling and 
writing for Hope, but also for the best comedy shows of the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so close," Lachman said, "that I could come up with a punch line and 
Billy with a straight line, and we could put them together for a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Both Lachman and Nan Burrows say that Larkin was the most organized person they 
had ever met. Even his maps were filed and labeled. He kept records of who 
borrowed what from his extensive tool collection. 
</P>
<P>
"What Billy really wanted to be was a funny plumber," Lachman said. "He wanted 
to work on pipes and do jokes for housewives in the daytime." 
</P>
<P>
Larkin's life brimmed over with comedy, but ended in despair. "I'm actually 
excited about dying," his own last note said. "In one instant, I can solve a 
million little problems." 
</P>
<P>
The note was found in his very neat apartment. As Lachman put it, "Not a thing 
was out of place." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody, I don't know who, once said, "Dying is easy, comedy's hard." For Bill 
Larkin, living was hard too. Last Thursday, he gave it up.

DEED CLAUSE BARS POPULAR AFRICAN FESTIVAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying their hands were tied by the terms of a 61-year-old deed, Los Angeles 
officials have told sponsors of a popular African cultural festival that the 
monthly event can no longer be held at the city-owned Leimert Plaza in the 
Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
The decision prompted about 60 supporters of Afrikan Culture Day on Monday to 
protest at City Hall what they called a "bureaucratic outrage," and a spokesman 
for Mayor Tom Bradley said that the matter will be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Fair' 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not fair. It (the festival) helps the community by bringing culture 
to the people," said 13-year-old Jamila Daniel, as she and other children held 
up placards to passers-by on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
Jamila's father, Warren Daniel, and other community leaders started Afrikan 
Culture Day last March in Leimert Plaza, a one-acre park with a fountain and a 
few trees centrally located in the Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
No admission is charged to the festival, at which African music and dance are 
performed. The entertainers are paid from part of the proceeds from 35 
concession stands, where food, art and clothes are sold, said Daniel, who sells 
silver jewelry at the festival staged at the park. 
</P>
<P>
The vendors are what prompted the city to balk at renewing the permit for the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, city officials discovered that the festival was operating in 
violation of a deed that prohibited any business of a commercial nature at 
Leimert Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Planning officer Alonzo A. Carmichael, who found the deed while researching an 
application to change the name of the park, visited the festival and found it 
"full of vendors selling goods of all kinds similar to the sidewalk stands 
along Ocean Front Walk in Venice." 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to Jane Rasco, assistant general manager of the Department of 
Recreation and Parks, Carmichael said: "Whether they had a permit is unknown 
and irrelevant. We don't want the heirs taking back the property." 
</P>
<P>
The organizers' effort to get the Parks and Recreation Department to rescind 
its decision failed, so they sought Monday to appeal the matter to the mayor, 
bringing a petition with 600 signatures to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters danced to the beat of conga drums on the steps of City Hall 
before going to the mayor's office to present their petition. They did not meet 
with the mayor, but press secretary Bill Chandler promised to bring the matter 
to Bradley's attention. 
</P>
<P>
While city officials say the festival can continue without the vendors, Daniel 
said that "without vendor participation, Afrikan Culture Day will be ended." He 
said also that the location is ideal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Benefits People' 
</P>
<P>
"Before Culture Day, African culture in Los Angeles was going the way of the 
Titanic," said Askia Muhammad, 45, who attended the protest rally. "This 
benefits people of all races and cultures. On an average Saturday, it's like a 
United Nations there." 
</P>
<P>
Bea Jones, 43, a mental health consultant who lives within walking distance of 
the park, said she was puzzled at the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"People look forward to it and the fellowship it brings. Black people are 
accustomed to this kind of action, but there really is no logical reason to 
stop the festival." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pharoah Rameses, 31, of Highland Park, who sells reggae T-shirts and 
African artifacts at the festival: 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell kids not to sell crack on the corner and at the same time 
say they can't sell T-shirts in the park to make a decent living. You can't get 
rich out of it and you stay out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The heirs of the grantor said Monday that they were unaware of any violation of 
the deed. George Leimert III said his late grandfather's company, which deeded 
the land to the city in 1928, is now defunct. 
</P>
<P>
"We were unaware of the violation and the fuss over the matter," Leimert said. 
"From the information we have, we're in support of cultural activities like 
this. We think it's kind of neat to have these events in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Leimert said he and his father were considering a request to alter the deed 
restriction to allow the vendors in the park. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials say that might not be easy. Pedro Echeverria of the 
city attorney's office said the Leimerts' approval might not change the 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to place the city in jeopardy." he said, adding that even 
within the Leimerts' approval, removal of the restriction could take months. 
</P>
<P>
"And that is assuming that the city wants to undertake to remove it," 
Echeverria said.

CONDO LIMBO; 
</P>
<P>
WEST HOLLYWOOD LAW LIMITING APARTMENT CONVERSIONS UPHELD; BUYERS OF UNITS LEFT 
IN A LEGAL TWILIGHT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee and Julie Kibbler looked at a dozen condominiums last year before finding 
one to fit their budget. 
</P>
<P>
It was a no-pool, no-spa, no-frills kind of place, but from their third-floor 
vantage point, it offered a nice view of West Hollywood, and, most of all, it 
was something they could afford. 
</P>
<P>
No one told them that West Hollywood had a lawsuit against the developer who 
sold them their home, claiming the 18-unit building where they chose to buy 
never should have been converted to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
They found out three weeks ago, after a state appeals court upheld a West 
Hollywood law prohibiting the conversion of apartment buildings to condominiums 
without the city's approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like victims, when all we did was scrimp and save to buy our first 
home," said Julie Kibbler, 33. "You would think we committed some sort of 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
They are among scores of West Hollywood condo owners left in limbo as a result 
of the ruling by the Court of Appeal. The three-judge panel directed a lower 
court to issue a restraining order barring future condominium conversions that 
violate a ban imposed by West Hollywood officials in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, issued in Los Angeles, left unresolved the outcome of conversions 
that occurred in violation of the ban, saying West Hollywood officials are best 
equipped to deal with the "variety of problems" the conversions pose. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for various owners of the buildings who sold off units as condos have 
said they intend to ask the appeals court to rehear the case. Failing that, 
they said, they will appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
But that is small consolation to Julie Kibbler, a free-lance writer, and Lee, 
32, an electronics technician, who combined their small savings with an income 
tax refund to come up with the $7,500 down payment for their home. 
</P>
<P>
"It might not be much for most people, but it was everything we had," Julie 
Kibbler said. "No one ever said anything about a lawsuit. We never dreamed the 
city would come along three years later and question the rightful ownership of 
our property." 
</P>
<P>
Their consolation may be in knowing that they aren't alone. 
</P>
<P>
The ban began as a moratorium imposed by the new City Council the day West 
Hollywood became a city in 1984. The council made it permanent in 1986 with an 
ordinance making the conversions illegal unless the owners obtained 
conditional-use permits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
No one really knows how many apartments have been converted to condominiums 
since the law was enacted. City officials estimate that there have been about 
100, while lawyers for the owners of some buildings that were converted to 
condominiums say the figure is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
After the owners of 26 buildings went ahead with conversions in defiance of the 
ordinance, citing permission obtained from the county government before the 
city was incorporated, the city went to court to halt the sales. But on three 
occasions, Los Angeles Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the building 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the building owners say the consequences of the court's decision 
could be "mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those units have been sold more than once. If, as the city claims, 
they're not really condos but apartments, who do they (city officials) plan to 
come back on?" said Stephen L. Jones, a lawyer representing several of the 
building owners. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood officials have said little about how they plan to proceed, 
except to say they do not intend to try to evict people who purchased 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
However, several building owners involved in the conversions, speaking on 
condition that they not be identified, said they expect the city to try to 
impose a monetary settlement against them. In buildings where apartment units 
remain unsold, the city may try to get control of the units and make them 
available to low- and moderate-income renters, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We bear no grudge against individual (condo) owners," Mayor Abbe Land said. 
"Our beef is with the developers who sold off the units, and we're going to be 
meeting with them to try and work out a resolution to the problem without 
anyone losing their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Such assurances have done little to curb the resentment of condo owners whose 
property rights appear to have been clouded by the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen of them confronted the mayor and other officials at City Hall 
after a recent closed-door session of the City Council, accusing officials of 
negligence for failing to notify them that the lawsuit was pending. 
</P>
<P>
"Where were you when my building was being converted, when we were buying our 
unit to keep from being evicted?" shouted Harry Herscovici, who bought his 
two-bedroom unit on Crescent Heights Boulevard last year to avoid having to 
move after the owner of the building decided to convert it. "You told us then 
nothing could be done, and now you say our condos are really apartments." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Michael Jenkins blamed the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is, your sellers sold to you without giving you notice 
(of the suit), and that seems to be the heart of the problem. That's where your 
anger should be directed. . . . We don't want to throw you people out in the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
But such assurances do not impress Julie Kibbler. 
</P>
<P>
"They're essentially saying, 'We could throw you out but we're not going to do 
that,' " she said. "Aren't they wonderful people?"

'AMERICAN' PARTS FOR ARMY WERE KOREAN, SUIT ALLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A federal judge Monday unsealed a civil fraud case against a Los Angeles 
defense contractor who has been sentenced for fraudulently providing South 
Korean-made military parts under the government's "Buy American" program. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court suit, seeking about $15 million in damages, alleges 
that Jerry M. Lewis Truck Parts &amp; Equipment Inc. of Los Angeles defrauded 
the government by supplying foreign-made items to the Army, ranging from clutch 
parts for tanks to propeller shafts. The company falsely claimed that the parts 
had been made in the United States, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis got numerous military contracts under the government's "Buy American" 
program designed to benefit domestic manufacturers, particularly small domestic 
manufacturers, but the company obtained much of the material it sold to the 
government from South Korean companies, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis officials disguised the origin of its products by creating a false paper 
trail of invoices and other documents, the suit said. In some instances, it set 
up sham companies and in other instances created phony purchase orders and 
invoices involving real domestic companies. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to the government exceeded $5 million, according to an affidavit filed 
by Gregory S. Mosely, an auditor for the Army's Tank-Automotive Command, who 
monitored the Lewis company's contracts with the command. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Steven Lewis, the company's president, and Robert Holtzman, its 
vice president, pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges stemming from the 
same alleged incidents. In January, Lewis was sentenced to 18 months in prison 
and fined $250,000. Holtzman was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann, who prosecuted the case, urged U.S. 
District Judge Robert M. Takasugi to impose stiff penalties because of the 
nature of the crime and because of the potential danger the defendants had 
created for U.S. military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
In a sentencing memorandum filed in January, Hagemann referred to Mosely's 
affidavit which said, "By its intentional disregard of contractual requirements 
and its elaborate scheme to cover up product defects and nonconformities," the 
Lewis company "compromised the operation of multimillion-dollar defense 
systems, and imperiled the lives of American soldiers who used and depended on 
those systems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total of $11.8 Million 
</P>
<P>
At the time the fraud was discovered, Mosely said, Lewis had 44 open contracts 
with the government and one open purchase order with a total dollar value of 
$11.8 million. In tests performed by the tank command, 86% of the material 
supplied by the company was defective, according to Mosely's affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the company had been able to underbid legitimate U.S. 
producers because it had obtained goods cheaply in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The civil case unsealed Monday was filed by Hall &amp; Phillips, a Los Angeles 
firm that specializes in defense fraud under the False Claims Act, which allows 
private citizens to file cases on behalf of the United States in an attempt to 
deter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs are Alnoor Virani, a former quality control manager at Lewis 
Truck Parts who was fired when he raised questions about the company's 
practices, and Taxpayers Against Fraud, a nonprofit organization incorporated 
in California in 1986 for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting 
corporations and persons that have made false claims against the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis of Allegations 
</P>
<P>
The suit states that the fraudulent acts occurred "from at least 1984 to 
October, 1987," and perhaps longer. The suit states that defendants Lewis and 
Holtzman submitted invoices to U.S. agencies which falsely represented that the 
Lewis company was manufacturing or supplying military parts from small 
businesses in the United States and "deceived" the government about the quality 
of the parts. 
</P>
<P>
Such suits, known as qui tam cases, initially are filed under seal for at least 
60 days to give the Justice Department time to determine whether it wants to 
jointly prosecute the case with the private citizen. This case was originally 
filed under seal on March 5. After the Justice Department filed notice of its 
decision to intervene in the case, the suit was unsealed. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Catherine Lunsford said the U.S. attorney's office would 
make no comment on the case. Janet L. Goldstein, who filed the suit for Hall 
&amp; Phillips, said that liability had been established as a matter of law in 
the case because the defendants already had pleaded guilty. She said that the 
sole issue to be determined now was the extent of damages. 
</P>
<P>
The False Claims Act provides for treble damages, so if the government was 
injured to the extent of $5 million, the defendants could be liable for $15 
million. Under the law, a plaintiff in a qui tam case that has been joined by 
the Justice Department is entitled to a minimum of 15% of the recovery to a 
maximum of 25%, depending on a judge's assessment of how much the individual 
plaintiffs contributed to the success of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Oliver, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented the Lewis company in the 
criminal case, declined to comment on the new suit, saying he had not seen it.

DODGERS CAN'T SOLVE GLAVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Glavine was drafted by teams in two professional sports, the Atlanta Braves 
and the L.A. Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Much to the Dodgers regret, he chose the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Because while Glavine may look as if he's merely an above average left-hander 
on a below-average ballclub to the rest of the league, to the Dodgers, he looks 
as unstoppable as Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
So Glavine pitches for the struggling Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. 
</P>
<P>
So he got only one run to work with Monday night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
No sweat. 
</P>
<P>
So he was pitching with a pulled right thigh muscle. 
</P>
<P>
No big deal. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine (10-6) made his run stand up as he always seems to do against the 
Dodgers, shutting them out, 1-0, on four hits before a crowd of 27,284. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta third baseman Jeff Blauser won the game with a home run in the third 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it," said Glavine of his dominance of the Dodgers, "but 
hopefully it will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just more confident. Last year, I couldn't go to my off-speed pitch and I 
kept hurting myself by walking people. This year I've had great control and I'm 
able to use my off-speed pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Don't think the Dodgers haven't noticed. Glavine is 4-0 against them in '89, 
having given up two unearned runs in 32 2/3 innings. Twice he has shut them out 
and three times he has pitched complete games. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, his record against the Dodgers was 0-5 with a 7.55 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-luck loser Monday was Ramon Martinez (3-1), who equaled a career-high 
with nine strikeouts and also gave up only four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez sailed through the first six Atlanta batters he faced, striking out 
three. 
</P>
<P>
But the seventh batter, Blauser, found a pitch to his liking and sailed it over 
the center-field wall, just beyond the outstretched glove of Jose Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
It was Blauser's sixth home run, and the sixth Martinez has allowed in six 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
That was the extent of the Atlanta offense. But remember who was pitching. And 
remember on whose mound he was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers threatened a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Willie Randolph singled and, with two out, stole second. 
Jeff Hamilton then sent a long fly ball in the same direction as Blauser's. But 
this one came down a few feet short of the center-field wall, safely in the 
grasp of Oddibe McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Gonzalez led off by bouncing a ball off the left-center wall for 
a double. Franklin Stubbs' fly ball to center sent Gonzalez to third. 
</P>
<P>
But there he stayed as Mike Scioscia bounced to second and Martinez grounded to 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mike Huff never caught the clues. His teammates on the triple-A 
Albuquerque club kept dropping hints Sunday that he need not worry about being 
given a day off, his first in several months. "Don't worry about your average," 
he was told. "It's going to stay where it is the rest of the year." Finally, 
his manager, Kevin Kennedy said to him, "You still don't know, do you?" Huff 
indeed had no idea that he had been recalled by the Dodgers and was hours away 
from putting on his first major league uniform. Huff's mother, the former Karen 
Mendyka, was a top javelin thrower in the early 1960s. She finished third in 
the 1960 Olympic trials after spraining an ankle. Karen Huff, a Los Angeles 
resident, missed her son's first major league game. She's in Oregon for the 
Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
With Kal Daniels (sore right knee) and Mickey Hatcher (strained left hamstring) 
on the disabled list, the Dodgers have made a total of 17 such moves this 
season. They made only 11 all of last year. . . . Hatcher was given the Big 
Brother of the Year Award before Monday's game for his work with children.

RECOVERING A CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER FACING DRUG ADDICTION, LONNIE SMITH SAVORS BRAVE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call always comes at night. Usually quite late. Most often, while he's 
staying in either Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
It has been five weeks since his last one, so Lonnie Smith has this gut feeling 
that before the Atlanta Braves leave town when their three-game series against 
the Dodgers ends, he'll be receiving another. 
</P>
<P>
The message never changes; only the voice: 
</P>
<P>
Voice: "The commissioner's planning a drug test tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Smith: "Thanks for calling." 
</P>
<P>
End of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Smith knows the routine by now. He'll show up at the ballpark a little early, 
wait for someone to introduce himself in the visiting clubhouse, and accompany 
him down the corridor to the umpires' room. 
</P>
<P>
"They always do it there," Smith said. "They want to keep it confidential, and 
inconspicuous as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the room, Smith will be presented two empty bottles. He'll be asked 
to urinate into each of them. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that the stranger would stand a few feet behind Smith, allowing 
him privacy. No more, Smith said, not since New York Giant linebacker Lawrence 
Taylor's book, "Living on the Edge," described how he was able to outsmart the 
system by sneaking in teammates' urine, avoiding detection. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the stranger stands right alongside Smith, and actually watches him fill 
the bottles. If Smith is unable, the stranger gives him glasses of water, 
refusing to leave until both bottles are filled. He seals the bottles, has 
Smith sign the required paper work, and takes the bottles to the laboratory. 
One will be tested, the other frozen as a safeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Some may find the process degrading, demeaning, even humiliating. 
</P>
<P>
To Smith, it's a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Six times this season he has submitted to this procedure, most recently in 
Philadelphia five weeks ago. He has no choice but to cooperate. If he refuses, 
he can be banned from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to play baseball, this is what I have to do," Smith said. "And if I 
can't go to the bathroom, it doesn't matter, they'll just keep feeding me water 
until I go. That's embarrassing, but those are the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Is this appropriate treatment for the man who appears to be the landslide 
choice as comeback player of the year? 
</P>
<P>
No, Smith says, this is part of being a recovering drug addict. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people say to me that it's not fair, that because I haven't used in 
six years, I'm cured," Smith said. "That's crazy. You're never cured, and never 
will be. You may not be using, but you're not cured. There is no miracle cure 
for a drug addict or alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day is a battle. You think about it all the time, especially when 
there's a lot of pressure, and you're all alone. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't go back. Not even once. Because I know if I tried it again, it'd 
be a hell of a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I don't know how I made it this far, I really don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Billows of smoke overhead, Smith lights another cigarette and inhales slowly, 
revealing the wrinkles that outline his face, and the dark shadows under his 
eyes. He's only 33 and should be in the prime of his life. But there are times, 
he says, when he feels like an old man. 
</P>
<P>
This, by rights, should be the most satisfying time of Smith's life. Cast off 
by the Kansas City Royals, and rejected by every major league club in baseball, 
he returned to the minor leagues and resurfaced this season as an elite player. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the Braves' starting left fielder, began Monday's game against the 
Dodgers with a .332 batting average, fourth-best in the National League, and 
among the league leaders in seven other offensive categories, including a 
league-leading .434 on-base percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"It might sound kind of strange because we're in last place, but I don't know 
where we'd be without him," said teammate Dale Murphy, a seven-time all-star. 
"He's the only consistent player we have. Without him, I think we'd have real 
trouble winning any games." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, although everything on the surface may look rosy, Smith admits that 
it's actually a facade. There are days when the pressure builds and surges of 
stress pound inside his head. Then, the best place to be is the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"It's starting to wear me down," Smith said. "I'm coming to the ballpark tired, 
sleepy. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy with the way my life is going 
professionally, but personally, I'm having some problems." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when he recalled his most difficult conversation as admitting 
that he was a drug addict to St. Louis Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
That changed over the winter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With tears streaming down his face, he told his wife of nearly 11 years that he 
wanted a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for Pearl and his two kids, he said, he would have given up on 
life long ago. They were his inspiration, helping him not only to revive his 
career, but his life. 
</P>
<P>
The kids were there, Smith said, when "I was doing it in the house. They wanted 
to know, 'Why is daddy snorting sugar up his nose?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pearl was there, Smith said, "when I cared about nothing else but my next 
high." 
</P>
<P>
So here he is, with his 11th wedding anniversary coming up on Aug. 26, trying 
to sort out his life, craving to see the children that his wife now keeps away 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife doesn't understand this," he said. "When I told her I wanted a 
divorce, she thought I was on drugs again. She called my therapists, and I had 
to convince them that this is something that's been building up for years. 
</P>
<P>
"But it hurts. It hurts bad. A long time ago, I made a promise to my kids that 
I would never leave them. Now, just at the time their lives are really getting 
started, with my son going to junior high in three years and my girl going 
there in four years, I won't be around. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen them all summer, and now summer's about over and they're about 
to go to school. There's an emptiness right now." 
</P>
<P>
Until his lawyer stepped in, Smith was sending $10,000 a month of his annual 
$250,000 salary to his wife and kids. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids are handling (the separation) much better than I am or my wife is," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Smith said, a woman, Dorothy Driver, has come into his life. He 
does not know when, or if, they will marry, but she is his constant companion, 
he said, the one now who helps him survive. 
</P>
<P>
When she's not on the road with him, Smith is on the phone with her. The 
telephone, he said, helps him fight the loneliness, the boredom, and most of 
all the depression. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not talking with her, Smith said, his mind wanders. And when his mind 
wanders, it usually wanders into temptation. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get too isolated, you tend to think about (using cocaine)," he said. 
"You start thinking about it all the time. That's when you really think you 
need some. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what got me the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Smith started smoking marijuana at Centennial High School in Compton, where he 
was a high school All-American baseball player. No big thing, he figured, 
everyone was doing it, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Selected third in the 1974 June free-agent draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Smith had plenty of bonus money to spend on himself and his friends. He was the 
main man in his circle of friends. Why, not only was Smith cool enough to smoke 
dope while establishing his career, he could even buy plenty for his friends. 
</P>
<P>
The only time he got in trouble was in 1975, during his second professional 
season, when he and a few of his Spartanburg teammates were caught smoking by 
their coaches. Oh, they were reprimanded, but it was not considered a serious 
offense, such as missing the cutoff or throwing to the wrong base. 
</P>
<P>
In two years, Smith progressed so rapidly that, at 19, he was playing for the 
Phillies' triple-A team in Oklahoma City. So close to making the big leagues, 
Smith decided to spend his 1977 off-season playing winter ball in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that Smith discovered cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know how to do it," Smith said. "They had to show me how to put 
the straw to my nose. I didn't like it at first, but when it started draining 
out, I said to myself, 'Ooh, this feels good. I like it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then I said, 'Do you know where I can get some more?' " 
</P>
<P>
At first, Smith said he only used cocaine on occasion. Then, when he joined the 
major league club, he met Curtis Strong, the Phillies' clubhouse caterer and 
the man described in the federal government's case against him in 1985 as "a 
traveling salesman of cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Smith thought he had found utopia. Not only could he buy cocaine whenever he 
wished, but Strong's stuff was the best around, he said. The cocaine was mixed 
with speed, and at $100 a gram, was a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
He started buying an eighth of an ounce at a time, then slowly found himself 
needing a little more, a little more until he was buying half an ounce at a 
time. His habit increased to $1,500 a week, but he had plenty of money, earning 
$500,000 by 1983, and $700,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The funny part, Smith said, was that for a long while, no one suspected a 
thing. He even kept some with him during games, hiding it in his socks. 
</P>
<P>
Dickie Noles, Smith's roommate in 1980 with the Phillies, said: "I didn't have 
any idea. I just couldn't believe it. I didn't see any of that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, who could tell by the way Smith was playing? He batted .339 his rookie 
year, earning the first of three World Series rings, and came back to hit .324 
the next season. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies, however, began to suspect that Smith had a drug problem in 1981, 
and at the end of the season traded him to the Cardinals. Smith was crushed. 
How was he supposed to get his cocaine from Strong? 
</P>
<P>
Strong comforted Smith, suggesting that a legitimate overnight delivery service 
would easily solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd get a newspaper, fold it up, paste the coke to some cardboard, and put it 
inside the newspaper," Smith said. "And I would get it the next day. It was all 
so easy." 
</P>
<P>
Smith adjusted quickly to St. Louis. He became close friends with Keith 
Hernandez, who not only was his teammate, but a buddy with whom he could spend 
the whole night snorting cocaine together. Sometimes they'd begin as soon as 
the game was over, and not stop until it was time to go to the ballpark the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
They partied their way to the World Series championship in 1982, and Smith was 
playing so well -- batting .307 with a league-leading 120 runs -- that he 
nearly won the National League's most-valuable-player award, losing out to Dale 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were riding on the top of the world and we didn't think anyone could knock 
us off," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine has a way of doing that, but just when you think you're invincible, you 
find out you've been had. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's bank account withstood his $60,000-a-year habit just fine; it was his 
body that couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
The crash began quickly. Smith lost his appetite and dropped 20 pounds in a 
month. And he couldn't sleep, either. What had been mild headaches became 
throbbing migraines that didn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
He became quick-tempered and once got so enraged at the antics of the Phillie 
Phanatic, his former club's mascot, that he viciously tackled him between 
innings, spraining both ankles of the man inside the costume, David Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
When the fans started booing him as he took the field the next inning, Smith 
challenged them, daring them to throw things at him. They obliged and the 
umpires suggested to Herzog that he remove Smith from the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care about the game, I didn't care about anything," Smith said. "I 
was just in a hurry to get the game over with so we can start using again." 
</P>
<P>
Smith used again that night, and when he went to the clubhouse the next day, 
after 36 hours without sleep, he was too wasted to even attempt playing. 
</P>
<P>
He went into Herzog's office, admitted his addiction and asked for help. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of June 8, 1983, he was checked into the Highland Center in 
St. Louis for substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
His wife heard about it on the radio. His parents read it in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I disgraced myself, I disgraced my family," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith turned out to be the lucky one. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strong, the man who sold Smith most of his cocaine, is in federal 
prison, serving 12 years for distributing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 scouting reports from the Kansas City coaching staff and scouts are in 
a folder on the corner of Royal General Manager John Schuerholz's desk. They 
were securely stashed away in his desk until a couple of months ago, but with 
reporters telephoning so often, Schuerholz now keeps them close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
The question is always simple, and quite direct: "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Why in the world did the Royals, who have been in dire need of a leadoff hitter 
all season, give up on Smith? Why didn't anyone pick him up once the Royals 
released him after the season? Why wasn't he given another chance? 
</P>
<P>
Schuerholz pulled out his folder, dated Sept. 23, 1987, from the Royals' annual 
scouting report, and thumbed through the evaluations of his staff: 
</P>
<P>
"Don't know if the desire's there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"He's slowed down, and he wasn't all that good before." 
</P>
<P>
"He's strictly an offensive player, and his offense is gone." 
</P>
<P>
"Just can't see him in the picture for '88." 
</P>
<P>
Said Schuerholz: "We just felt he was through. He wasn't hitting well, he 
wasn't running well, and this looked like the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we appreciated what he did for us in '85. We don't think we could have 
won the World Series without him. But we didn't see him fitting into our 
future, either." 
</P>
<P>
Smith doesn't fault the Royals for releasing him after batting .251 with eight 
runs batted in over the second half of the 1987 season, but he bitterly resents 
the Royals for spreading the word that he had a bad attitude and could no 
longer play. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did respect anyone in that organization except the players anyway," 
Smith said. "I heard what they were saying about me." 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith might not be a role model for youngsters and although he can 
make a front office nervous because of his candidness, there is respect for him 
among players and managers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the three best baseball people I ever managed, in terms of 
aggressiveness, were Hal McRae, George Brett and Lonnie Smith," Herzog said. 
"Those three by far are the best. He'd bust into second base, he'd climb a 
wall, he'd crash into the fence. What he was, well what he still is, is a 
ballplayer's ballplayer, a throwback to the old days." 
</P>
<P>
Said former Royal pitcher Dan Quisenberry, now with St. Louis: "He wasn't an 
organization type of player. He didn't do milk commercials. He didn't go to 
malls and sign autographs for three hours. He didn't go to airports and kiss 
babies. But, wow, did he play. Even when he made mistakes in the outfield, and 
slipped and fell, you could never get mad at him because he played so hard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing. He's been gone from St. Louis, for what, eight years, and guys 
still talk about him here. They say if they had the DH in the National League, 
he would have died a Cardinal." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, only three years after receiving his third World Series ring, Smith 
found himself unemployed, sitting by the telephone at his home in Spartanburg, 
S.C. When it didn't ring, Smith began making his own calls. 
</P>
<P>
He called all 26 major league teams. Twenty-five told him to get lost. Only 
Bobby Cox, general manager of the Atlanta Braves, showed even the slightest 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
He had a job opening. But sorry, it wasn't at the major league level. It was in 
the Braves' triple-A club in Richmond, Va. The pay was $5,000 a month; about 
$725,000 less than he earned in his final full season with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith took it. 
</P>
<P>
He shocked the Braves' coaching staff by reporting about 30 pounds overweight, 
and each morning vomited on the field during conditioning drills. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith laughed. How were the Braves to know that he never was one for 
off-season conditioning, even during his heyday? 
</P>
<P>
Smith made the triple-A team, kept his batting average around .300, and asked 
himself why he even continued to play the game. He had already proven himself, 
hadn't he? Why didn't the Braves call him up to the big leagues? 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few times he said he was quitting," said Terry Blocker, Smith's 
roommate at Richmond. "But there was one night where I didn't think I was going 
to be able to talk him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We came back from a road trip, and Lonnie said, 'Terry, I'm not going to 
unpack my bags. I'm leaving. I've got no future in this organization, anyway, 
so I might as well leave. I think I'll tell them tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
Blocker said: " 'Hey, man, stay in there, you never know. I got a feeling 
they're going to do something. You've come too far to give up now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith agreed to stay until the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
And on July 27, 1988, he was called up by the Braves. He hit only .237 with 
nine RBIs the final 43 games. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing those numbers might not even prompt the Braves to invite him to spring 
training, he played winter ball in Puerto Rico. He hit .366, was voted the 
league's most valuable player, and carried it over to spring training where 
Manager Russ Nixon designated him as the starting left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
He started fast, too, hitting .324 with six homers and 18 RBIs, but while 
chasing a ball May 19 against the Cardinals, he crashed into a wall and 
severely sprained his left ankle. He missed 20 games. Once back in the lineup, 
though, he continued his torrid pace and appeared headed toward his first 
All-Star game since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to get my hopes up," Smith said. "But everybody kept saying, 
'You're going to make the All-Star team. You're going to make the All-Star 
team.' 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda passed him up. Instead, he selected Vince Coleman, 
who was batting .261, Andre Dawson at .270 and Von Hayes at .294, as his 
reserve outfielders, saying that Smith simply got caught in a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he knows what happened. The game he got caught in was the politics 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hurt, real hurt," Smith said. "And Dorothy was 
very upset and angry. My teammates were mad. I just told them, 'Hey, that kind 
of stuff happens to me. I'm not Tommy's idea of a ballplayer.' 
</P>
<P>
"When you're an addict, there are a lot doors closed to you." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Murphy is Mr. Atlanta Brave. Selected two spots lower than Smith in the 
1974 draft, has spent practically his whole career playing against Smith's 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy had met Smith but they certainly weren't close, either as friends or in 
philosophy. Murphy, for instance, won't even allow a female admirer to put her 
arm around him for a snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
Now that they are teammates Murphy is learning things about Smith that he never 
imagined. Smith, for instance, signs autographs until his hand is sore. He 
treats the batboys as if they're his teammates. If anyone has a problem, 
personal or professional, Smith will listen as long as anyone wants to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely not the guy I thought he was," Murphy said. "He's one of the 
best things that's happened to this club. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's aware what happened, and the situations he was involved in. You 
look at him now, and you wonder what happened, but you don't ask. I figure if 
he ever wants to tell me, he will, but something like that you just don't go up 
and ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here knows he's a very quality person, a special person." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also has been accepted by the city of Atlanta. His name is chanted by 
kids before games and he is beckoned to the stands for autographs. No longer 
can he eat in a restaurant uninterrupted or shop in a mall unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like I've been dead for the past few years and suddenly people are 
realizing that I'm alive," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like with my bats. In the past, it's taken months, sometimes a year even, 
for bat companies to send me bats. Now, I'm getting the best quality bats I've 
had in my career. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask all of the time, 'Are you surprised Lonnie? Are you surprised? Did 
you think you could ever do it?' Hey, the difference is that I got a chance. 
Someone believed in me, and they gave me a second chance, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe now, Smith hopes, he can be a role model for every other recovering drug 
addict and alcoholic in America. He understands that there still will be people 
who never accept him, and some forever will hold grudges against him, but 
that's life. 
</P>
<P>
"And to tell you the truth," Smith said, "it feels great to be a part of it."

MCCLURE IS KING OF COUCH;

RELIEVER TAKES IT EASY, BUT NOT ON HITTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob McClure is a couch potato. Not your average flop on the sofa and waste a 
Saturday in front of the TV variety, but a serious, dedicated one who considers 
his inactivity an art form. 
</P>
<P>
This is not just the passing whim of another flaky left-handed pitcher who's 
trying to impress his buddies in the clubhouse. The Angel reliever and his best 
friend, Dave Downing, have been refining this science for more than 20 years. 
And, after compiling notes for more than 10 years, McClure and Downing are 
writing a textbook on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
They even have a patent on a line of inactive leisure wear. Really. 
</P>
<P>
McClure calls it "rotting," and when he's not twirling curveballs past American 
Leaguers, he's buried in this sport he truly loves, one he contends is really 
this nation's favorite pastime. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the nuances of rotting, you've got to hear McClure tell it 
because, well, the book hasn't been published yet. So snuggle down into your 
sofa -- sitting is allowed but frowned upon -- and bone up on the lowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows, you may already be a master rotter without knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
First, the definition, according to McClure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotting: Getting parallel; the art or science of doing nothing while looking 
as if you are doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to erase the guilt people seem to feel about relaxing," McClure 
said. "Too many of my friends could not rott -- it's always spelled with two 
T's by the way -- without guilt. They felt they had to do something 
constructive. 
</P>
<P>
"We developed rotting so now they are, in fact, doing something. You advance by 
logging rott time and you move up in degrees, sort of like in karate. You start 
out at the green level, you know, sort of a rookie, and you wear a green robe 
or something. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're really dedicated, you can become an ultimate master rotter. Then you 
get a black robe with gold tips." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds easy, but dedication is required. One must master the moves, or 
positions, and have lots of free time. And the parameters of what constitutes a 
legal rott are well defined. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say your first day is Saturday," says McClure, who never so much as 
cracks a smile during the explanation. "If you get up on the couch and watch 
football all day and don't leave, except to go to the bathroom or to go to bed 
at night, you've accomplished a minor rott. 
</P>
<P>
"If you return and make it through Sunday, that's a major rott. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you make it all the way through 'Monday Night Football,' that's a coma 
rott. 
</P>
<P>
"And, if you can hang out all the way to 'Thursday Night Football,' six full 
days, that's a death rott. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only been two documented death rotts, by myself and Dave." 
</P>
<P>
But just lying there for the better part of week isn't enough. You've got to 
throw in a few maneuvers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The prenatal rott: "You have your back to the TV and you peek at it over 
your shoulder. This is a good one when you just can't lay on one side any 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The sailor rott: "Your eyes are at half-mast. This is a good one when 
you're in the second stage of a major rott." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The possum rott: "One eye is buried in the pillow and the other is open 
just enough to let the light of the TV in." 
</P>
<P>
And there are duo moves, such the tier rott, in which one guy lies on the floor 
below the guy lying on the couch. And there are group rotts and rott-a-thons. 
</P>
<P>
Defining and refining a new sport takes a great deal of time, not to mention a 
serious lack of effort. McClure knew all along it would be a rottin' job, but 
somebody had to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, Bob McClure is tough on hitters. Otherwise, he wouldn't have all 
this time to lie around and rott. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have asked him to ply his trade often but in short spurts. McClure 
is a specialist, a role player. He comes in to face a left-hander or two, or 
hold a runner close with his good move to first base if the Angels can't afford 
a stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
He's No. 3 on the team in number of appearances, 30, but he has fewer innings, 
26 2/3, than anyone else on the Angel staff except Rich Monteleone, who spent 
almost two months in the minors but already has pitched 25 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
He has been on the mound for more than two innings just twice this season. 
Eight times, he has thrown five or fewer pitches. Fourteen times, he has needed 
10 or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
But McClure has made the most of his brief stints. He allowed just one earned 
run in his first 17 appearances, has a 2.03 earned-run average and a 3-1 record 
with three saves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the kind of arm that doesn't take long to get ready," Manager Dour 
Rader said. "So we don't have to abuse him by getting him up and down, up and 
down. He's done a great job." 
</P>
<P>
And, maybe just as important, McClure graciously accepts this abbreviated role. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be contributing to a winning club," he said. "That's my role 
and that's fine with me. If we weren't in a position to be where we are . . . I 
don't know. But it's easy to be satisfied when you're winning." 
</P>
<P>
McClure has not always been a get-one-guy specialist. He has spent parts of 15 
seasons in the majors, including a stretch with Milwaukee when he started 67 
games in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have asked me 15 years ago if it were hard to stay mentally and 
physically prepared when you're pitching to just a couple of hitters every few 
days, I'd have said, 'Yes!' " McClure said. "But it's a learning process and 
I'm at the point now where I can get ready to come in with just five or six 
pitches in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
McClure has made some contributions in the clubhouse, too. He's not exactly a 
team leader, but he is one of a number of new Angels who have revived a sense 
of camaraderie on the team. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't set out to do it and, if they had, it probably would not have 
worked. In the past, the clubhouse has been a morgue, especially after games. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, a lot of players, led by a nucleus of McClure, catchers 
Bill Schroeder and Lance Parrish and pitchers Greg Minton and Bert Blyleven are 
sitting around in their underwear hours before the game and long after. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, at home, my wife will get on me about it," McClure said. "She'll 
say, 'You were in there for an hour and a half after the game.' But I try to 
explain to her that I could take a line drive off my elbow tomorrow. I want to 
enjoy this while I can. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask you what you're going to miss when you leave the game, and of 
course there's the competition. But my first response would be the camaraderie. 
Going through the winning and losing together. Helping each other through the 
tough times. The heartbreak and the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"These are special times." 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, it's pretty remarkable that McClure ever made it to the 
majors. He had a troubled childhood and was living on his own by the time he 
was a junior in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a punk, you know, fighting all the time, hanging around with the wrong 
crowd," he says. "I was the kid your mom told you to stay away from." 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of factors contributing to his adolescent problems, but McClure 
doesn't want to detail them. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, after I retire, maybe I'll tell the whole story," he says. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he finished high school, he had given up sports -- he lettered in 
football and basketball as well as baseball at Terra Nova High School in 
Pacifica, Calif., -- and was working full-time for the phone company in San 
Francisco. He decided to give school, and sports, another shot, though, and 
enrolled at San Mateo, a junior college, where he became an all-state, 
All-American pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger scout named Ray Perry developed a rapport with the rebellious youth 
who still carried a log-sized chip on his shoulder and figured his talent might 
outweigh his problems with a little maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray thought that stuff was all behind me," McClure said. "He was going to give 
me a chance. He told me the Dodgers were going to draft me, give me a $25,000 
signing bonus and send me to double-A ball." 
</P>
<P>
But Perry died before the draft. And after the Dodgers selected McClure the 
third round of the free-agent draft in 1973, another scout told McClure he 
would be sent to the rookie leagues and offered a $5,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"For a kid who had been living on his own as long as I had, $25,000 seemed like 
a fortune," McClure said. "But I'd have gone to Timbuktu for a thousand bucks 
for Ray. But this guy comes in and says to heck with what Ray promised me. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to (get lost)." 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, before the secondary phase of the free-agent draft, scouts 
from both San Diego and Kansas City called McClure. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the first guy (from Kansas City) where he was and he said it was about 
40 minutes away from where I was living," McClure said. "Then I talked to the 
other guy and he said he was about an hour and 10 minutes away. So I called the 
first guy back and said I'd be over in 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about either team or organization. I just wanted to get 
in a uniform and prove to the Dodgers I could play." 
</P>
<P>
The kid with something to prove carved out a life in the majors. He picked up a 
victory over the Angels during the 1982 American League championship series and 
went on to the World Series with the Brewers that year. 
</P>
<P>
He's committed to playing in another World Series this year, but he's also 
looking forward to the off-season, when he'll be satisfied with leaving a 
lasting impression in his sofa.

TENNIS AT MANHATTAN BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
MCNEIL SLIDE GOES FROM BAD TO WORSE, 7-6, 6-1

If you can't hit a baseball even though you've brought a garage door to the 
plate, you're in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
If the basketball rim looks about the size of a coffee cup from the free-throw 
line, you're in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
If each tennis ball you hit decides to make the net its new residence, you're 
in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
Lori McNeil is in a slump. Her ranking has plunged from No. 9 to No. 24 and she 
hasn't made it past the second round in 11 of her 16 tournaments. She lost 
again in the first round Monday night and her spirits can't be located with 
sonar. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm out there watching her matches, I just kind of have my fingers 
crossed," said Willis Thomas, McNeil's coach. "I don't know what's going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, it hasn't been too difficult to predict. Tami Whitlinger, who turned 
pro last month, defeated McNeil, 7-6 (9-7), 6-1, in the first round of the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in San Diego, McNeil lost in the first round to Bettina Bunge, who 
was playing her first singles match in almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlinger, a 20-year-old Wisconsin native who would have been a junior at 
Stanford in the fall, is ranked No. 249. Bunge is not ranked. 
</P>
<P>
Because her first-round losses are now six, how does McNeil feel about all 
this? 
</P>
<P>
"I think a little confused," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Every athlete goes through slumps, but McNeil's has nearly lasted since her 
first tournament of the year, the Australian Open. There she lost in the first 
round to a 31-year-old housewife from Fugisawa, Japan, named Yukie Koizumi, who 
has played only two tournaments all year. 
</P>
<P>
This is not what was expected for McNeil when she burst into prominence with an 
upset of Chris Evert in the 1987 U.S. Open. McNeil went far with her 
serve-and-volley game last year when she won two tournaments, reached the final 
in another and the semifinals in four more. 
</P>
<P>
Then Koizumi came zooming in to start McNeil's new year poorly. McNeil 
regrouped and held a match point against Martina Navratilova before losing in 
the final of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, she couldn't win the Peter Pan Pacfic Open. What's gone wrong? 
The 25-year-old daughter of former National Football League star Charlie McNeil 
got knocked out of bounds. She began losing matches and her confidence got 
misplaced, too. 
</P>
<P>
John Lloyd, who coached McNeil part-time in the past, said the problem with 
McNeil is in her head, which he fears may be the worst place for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Her mind is fragile," Lloyd said. "When her game is off, it's in her head. 
It's not technique. It's all concentration. On a scale of one to 10, she can go 
from nine to one in one match." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd believes McNeil will rebound and get back into the top 10 again if she 
works hard. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason why she can't peak in the next two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who became McNeil's coach after Wimbledon, had been Zina Garrison's 
coach. He said it's going to take a year to put McNeil together again. 
</P>
<P>
Her biggest obstacle? 
</P>
<P>
"Herself," Thomas said. "When you can't even get the ball on the court when 
your opponent is off the court, it's herself. It's mental." 
</P>
<P>
McNeil played just enough careless shots to lose the first set, then went down 
meekly in the second. She missed a break point for 4-2 in the first set, 
double-faulted for 3-4 and went on to blow four set points. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlinger was down, 15-40 and 4-5, but McNeil lost the next four points on 
unforced errors. In the tiebreaker, McNeil held two more set points, but the 
rookie Whitlinger got away from the more experienced player. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil seemed to choke back tears in her interview session after the match. She 
said she would play smaller tournaments to try to regain her confidence. She 
looked worried even thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
And there's something else. It's that odd feeling she's getting these days. 
</P>
<P>
"An inner feeling that I feel when I step on the court that I know every match 
is going to be very, very tough for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Peanut Louie Harper (sore neck) and Andrea Temesvari (sore shoulder) were 
forced to withdraw. . . . Isabelle Demongeot, who plays top-seeded Martina 
Navratilova in a second-round match Wednesday night, has decided to change 
coaches after the U.S. Open and part ways with Regis DeCamaret, who has been 
working with the 22-year-old French player since she was 10.

FORMER USC COACH LEFT LASTING IMPRESSION ON THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The years that Don Clark coached football at USC aren't memorable in context of 
the school's athletic achievements, but the man made a lasting impression on 
those who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who died Sunday night in Huntington Beach of what appeared to be a heart 
attack while jogging, was warmly remembered Monday by his friends. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
"In Don Clark, you had as fine a friend as a human being could have," said Marv 
Goux, who began his college coaching career as a member of Clark's USC staff in 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an All-American kind of individual. There has never been a finer man 
than Don Clark in all aspects. And he taught me techniques of the game that I 
still teach." 
</P>
<P>
Goux said that Clark hired him when he was coaching at Carpinteria High School. 
Goux coached at USC for 25 more years and is now the defensive line coach with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Clark hired another assistant in 1959, one who made an indelible impression at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
John McKay was on Clark's last staff in 1959. The next year he became USC's 
coach, a position he held for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost a great friend," McKay said by phone from Tampa, Fla. "I can't 
think of a nicer person than Don Clark. I've never heard anyone say a 
derogatory word about him. As a head coach, he told the assistants what he 
wanted done and then let us do it." 
</P>
<P>
Clark played guard at USC in 1942 and again in 1946 and 1947. Then, he played 
two years with the San Francisco 49ers before going into coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Salata, a former teammate of Clark with USC and the 49ers, said: "You 
would want to raise a son to be just like him." 
</P>
<P>
Clark became USC's coach at the worst possible time. The school, along with 
UCLA, California and Washington, had been sanctioned by the Pacific Coast 
Conference for payments to athletes in excess of the league's allowable limit. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors, such as All-American Jon Arnett, were allowed to play only half a 
season in 1956. Other players, who were juniors in 1956, lost their eligibility 
in 1957 because of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Clark became coach in 1957, USC had lost 11 players to graduation and 
eight more from the junior class the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterness among the penalized schools led to the dissolution of the 
Pacific Coast Conference in 1959. A new league, called the Athletic Assn. of 
Western Universities, was formed with USC, UCLA, California, Washington and 
later Stanford as the member schools. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1964 that all of the Northwest schools became reunited with the 
Big Five in the Pacific 8, now expanded to the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Clark reminisced about his coaching ordeal in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"When I became coach, we hadn't recruited for two years," he said. "(The PCC) 
didn't say we couldn't recruit, but they put severe restrictions on us. In the 
spring of 1957, we were down to walk-ons -- no quarterbacks, or receivers to 
speak of." 
</P>
<P>
Without established players, USC had a 1-9 record in 1957, beating only 
Washington. It's the worst record in school history. 
</P>
<P>
By recruiting such talented players as the McKeever twins -- Mike and Marlin -- 
the Trojans improved to 4-5-1 in 1958 and 8-2 in 1959. The two defeats in '59, 
however, were inflicted by UCLA and Notre Dame in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
Clark left USC after the 1959 season to take over the family business, the 
Prudential Overall Supply Co., from an ailing brother. The company had 10 
plants by the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
During Clark's tenure at USC, he coached a quarterback, Willie Wood, and a 
tackle, Ron Mix, who later made the National Football League Hall of Fame. Wood 
was inducted Saturday after a career as a defensive back with the Green Bay 
Packers. Mix made his reputation with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there was a young assistant on Clark's staff who became renowned in 
the administrative aspect of pro football: Al Davis, the managing general 
partner of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the guy," Davis said of Clark. "I loved his family. He was a vital 
part of my life and my friend. And the memories of those teams are great. 
</P>
<P>
"We had over 20 guys make the pros from those teams and two Hall of Famers. I 
was just a kid then who came out from the East Coast. Don was a man, a great 
leader and was inspirational to me." 
</P>
<P>
Clark grew up on a farm in Iowa and he recalled listening on the radio to a USC 
game in the Rose Bowl while milking cows. 
</P>
<P>
His family moved to California in 1939, when he was 15. Clark then attended 
Washington High, earning All-City honors in football before enrolling at USC. 
</P>
<P>
After playing for USC in 1942, he enlisted in the Army and fought in the Battle 
of the Bulge. He reportedly spent 18 months in the combat zone and won a 
battlefield commission. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was distinguished by his crew cut, a rugged build and a zest for athletic 
competition even in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements at Pierce Bros.-Smith Mortuary in Huntington Beach are 
pending.

As a longtime Julie Andrews fan, Los Angeles accountant Nina Stein headed 
straight for the box office when tickets went on sale to the veteran 
performer's recent two-night stand at the Greek Theatre. Stein, 42, paid $156 
for four choice seats. 
</P>
<P>
After the concert, she and her three friends went to Canter's Deli in the 
Fairfax District for a late-night nosh. To her surprise -- and dismay -- she 
saw a stack of vouchers by the cash register, each one good for four free 
tickets to either of Andrews' shows. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's first thought: Why had she just paid $156 for what others could see for 
free? 
</P>
<P>
"If Julie Andrews can't sell (enough) tickets to her comeback concert, maybe 
she shouldn't play such a large venue," Stein said in a letter to The Times. 
"She certainly shouldn't insult the fans she has left by making them feel like 
suckers." 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent phone interview, Stein was still steamed: "Here I am the stupid 
one who gets stuck spending over $100 and everyone else was walking in free." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not everyone else, but a significant number. Susan Rosenbluth, general 
manager of the 6,200-seat Greek Theatre, said that about 700 tickets were given 
away each night. 
</P>
<P>
And this was hardly an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
A Calendar survey of booking agents and personal managers suggests that the 
practice of distributing free concert tickets in an effort to fill empty seats 
-- "papering the house," as it's called in the industry -- is common. Industry 
insiders estimated that at least some papering goes on at 10% to 40% of all 
shows across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Papering is especially prevalent in the media centers of Los Angeles and New 
York, where a high premium is placed on maintaining the image of success. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Casey, vice president at the ICM talent agency in Beverly Hills, said: "If 
you're playing Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and you've got three-quarters of a house 
filled, you're not going to worry about it, but if you're playing the Forum (in 
Inglewood), you want to fill it up. You want to give the impression that you're 
successful in the major media markets. There's nothing worse than a review 
coming out saying so-and-so played to half a house, so you try and find a way 
of putting more people in there and filling it up a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
But Casey said it's usually done more "tactfully" than it was in the Andrews 
episode: "You try to do it as discreetly as possible so that it doesn't look 
like you're flooding the city with tickets." 
</P>
<P>
An Andrews associate, who requested anonymity, said that "those who did get in 
for free were sitting in the back of the theater to make it look nicer so Julie 
would feel comfortable when she walked out on stage." 
</P>
<P>
The associate added that whoever put the vouchers on the counter at Canter's 
"wasn't the person who was authorized to paper a limited amount of seats for 
the Greek Theatre. The theater may have given them to somebody who's involved 
in a charity or an organization, who decided like a jerk to leave them at 
Canter's." 
</P>
<P>
Papering the house -- which does not include the routine practices of giving 
away a limited number of promotional tickets for radio station giveaways and a 
limited number of complimentary tickets to members of the media and the 
industry -- is a sensitive subject in the concert business. Everybody does it 
from time to time, but nobody likes to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very embarrassing for both the artist and the venue," said Dick Alen, 
head of the music department at the William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for their reticence is that papering is one of the tricks of the 
trade to give the illusion of success. Many in the concert industry would 
prefer that audiences didn't realize that there's sometimes a difference 
between appearance and reality, that one can't simply look at the size of the 
audience as an accurate gauge of a performer's drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
But no one denies that papering is a common practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's done all the time," said Ron DeBlasio, a manager who has worked with such 
artists as Donna Summer and the rock group X. "There usually are seats 
remaining that aren't particularly good that nobody wants." 
</P>
<P>
DeBlasio, a former William Morris agent, added that this is especially true 
with performers such as Andrews, whose appeal is to an upper-demographic, 
middle-of-the-road audience. 
</P>
<P>
"That audience tends to buy high-scale tickets," he said. "They probably 
wouldn't buy cheap tickets way up on top or way over on the side. So those 
tickets are available." 
</P>
<P>
Papering the house is usually carried out during the 48 hours before a show. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Kahane, who co-manages George Michael and was formerly a booking agent, 
said, "It's always just the last couple of days when you know it's going to 
look like a disaster and you want to save face." 
</P>
<P>
The key to successful papering is distributing the tickets to people who will 
use them. "You can get tickets out easily enough," said ICM's Casey. "You can 
rent an airplane and drop them out over the city, but that's not the purpose. 
You want to get them to people who you know are going to want to go to the show 
and who are going to be grateful for getting the tickets." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to do that, sources agree, is to give tickets to people who don't 
normally have the opportunity -- or the money -- to attend concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's normally done on an organizational basis, usually through charity," said 
Rosenbluth of the Greek Theatre. "There are a whole bunch of them we deal with: 
B'Nai Brith Women, Youth for Christ, halfway houses, abused-women's shelters, 
county facilities for teen-agers. We just have somebody in the office pull the 
charity list and start making phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
The theater owners like to give tickets to charities for another reason: The 
people those organizations service aren't the theaters' regular customers. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not taking tickets out of the marketplace that way," DeBlasio said. "If 
you give them to the patrons at a restaurant or a shop, they may have bought 
tickets anyway." 
</P>
<P>
DeBlasio said that he considers papering a good business practice. In most 
cases, no one has to pay for the papered tickets, the face value of which is 
not included in the box-office grosses reported to trade publications. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a form of promotion," he said. "The venue is sitting there anyway, so if 
they give out free tickets, they're going to get some money back on parking and 
on refreshments. They may be giving them to charitable organizations, but that 
doesn't necessarily mean that everybody in the organization is penniless. And 
by papering you may drum up word-of-mouth on the act and expose a patron who 
may be become a repeat customer." 
</P>
<P>
So why don't promoters paper every show that fails to sell out? 
</P>
<P>
Alen of the Morris Agency said that promoters don't want audiences to become 
conditioned to getting free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"The promoter wants the house to be full, but he doesn't want the audience to 
think that they can get in for nothing," he said. "If an audience learns that, 
then they'll keep on waiting next time." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbluth, who said that the Greek papers just three or four shows a year out 
of 80 concerts, added: "The ticket is your only product. It's the only thing 
you can assign value to." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbluth said that she prefers discounting as an alternative to papering. She 
noted that many theaters offer twofers, coupons that allow a customer to buy 
two tickets for the price of one on shows that aren't sell-outs. 
</P>
<P>
But she acknowledged that there would be tremendous resistance to enacting a 
similar system for selling concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Most managers wouldn't want you to take an ad discounting their artist's 
tickets because of the importance of image in this city and the nature of our 
business," she said. "With the record and movie industries based here, image is 
more important here than in any city except New York."

TRACY SHAFFER AVOIDS THE SENTIMENT OF A SUGARY ROLE 
</P>

Tracy Shaffer knows the dangers of being too-good-to-be-true. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the trap," said the actress who plays Shelby, a young diabetic in 
"Steel Magnolias" (at the Wilshire Theatre). "I mean, this girl does her 
Christmas shopping in advance. She gourmet-cooks, she sings Mozart, she wears a 
lot of pink. I don't trust people when they're too sweet: 'Hi, how are you? You 
look great.' You say, 'What's behind that?' But when Shelby asks how you are, 
she really asks how you are. She cares." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Shaffer envisions her character as the emotional linchpin for 
the contemporary comedy-drama, set in a Louisiana beauty shop. A succession of 
Saturday-morning gabfests between the local customers is the backdrop for the 
loving relationship between Shelby and her mother (played by Barbara Rush) -- 
and the consequences when the newly married Shelby decides to get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the diabetes, she's lived her entire life knowing how precarious it 
is," Shaffer said. "The rest of us live in a state of denial about our 
mortality; it's something that happens to other people. But Shelby knows the 
truth of life -- which is that she can go any time. All her childhood she 
heard, 'You can't do that: you're fragile.' When they tell her she's going to 
die if she has a child, she says: 'I'm going to die anyway. I've been 'going to 
die' since I was 7 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Since the character is based on playwright Robert Harling's late sister, 
Shaffer (who's performed the part since the Pasadena Playhouse staging last 
fall) feels a responsibility to do justice to her memory. "You want to be as 
good as they remember her," she said. "I know there have been others who played 
the role, but -- like I told Bobby, 'Now that I've met your family, I think I 
am your sister.' " 
</P>
<P>
That includes her transformation into a Louisiana belle. "I'm not a Southern 
girl," said Shaffer, who was born in La Mirada. "But I did spend some time 
there when I had a Southern beau. And yes, I can drawl. But it's more than a 
drawl. It's in the moves, in the wind. There's a heaviness in the air when it's 
humid -- and it permeates everyone's lives. If you were playing a girl from 
Texas who lives out on a ranch, she'd have a big, broad, free, 
cutting-through-the-plains type of movement. 
</P>
<P>
"In the South the trees are old, they hang low. The magnolias and honeysuckle 
and jasmine come out and there's a lot of sweetness in the air. It's a kind of 
loveliness you can get into -- like when you hear a song and you dance (to that 
mood). 
</P>
<P>
"Once I was in Alaska doing 'Noises Off' and it was dark all the time. After 
the second week, I thought, 'This is what Ibsen is like; this is the 
Scandinavian experience of life.' And you realize how much environment affects 
people." 
</P>
<P>
In the last seven months of touring, she's had to make some adjustments to her 
own rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time in my life where all I had to be responsible for was being 
at the theater eight times a week for 3 1/2 hours," Shaffer said sunnily. "I 
wasn't getting my bills, my mail; I'd delegated all that stuff. I could 
basically watch soap operas and eat bon bons all day if I wanted to -- although 
I didn't. Our (regular) lives are like a series of appointments; we structure 
ourselves into little periods of time. So it was jarring at first." 
</P>
<P>
An alumna of the Stella Adler Conservatory in New York, Shaffer moved West in 
1986. A waitressing job at the Hard Rock Cafe kept her afloat during her leaner 
acting days. "I look at the women in this cast," she said, referring to such 
elders as Rush, Marion Ross and Carole Cook -- "all of us actresses at 
different points in our lives and careers. Each of us has a unique talent, each 
has taken a unique path. Being with them has allowed me to see how life in this 
industry can treat you. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at them and say, 'Is there a reason I have to buy into this (career) 
fear?' Sure, it's easy to be neurotic. You get off the plane in L.A. and think: 
'I'm not pretty enough, not tall enough, not blond enough, my nails aren't long 
enough -- and I put on a ton of weight on the tour.' You can drive yourself mad 
thinking how you're not enough. But after five minutes of that you say, 'Wow, 
really boring. I don't have to buy into that.' "

<P>
William C. W. Mow sat in his Chatsworth office smoking cigarettes and trying to 
explain the strange detours in his life. 
</P>
<P>
At 53, he's attained a success that few will enjoy. As founder and chairman of 
Bugle Boy Industries, he runs one of the hottest clothing companies in America. 
Last year's sales of $267 million should climb to $500 million this year, he 
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age boys and young men can't seem to get enough of Bugle Boy's casual 
clothes, snatching them from shelves at retailers as diverse as J. C. Penney 
and Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now everybody wants his product," said Peter McGrath, young men's 
apparel merchandising manager at Penney. "In the young men's market, there 
really isn't anybody they buck up against other than Levis. Kids want it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with L.A. Gear and Guess?, Bugle Boy is part of the powerful new 
California-influenced apparel business. Mow, who owns 90% of Bugle Boy, could 
probably sell the business tomorrow for $250 million or more, although he said 
he's happy running a private company and has no plans to sell or go public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted to 'Get Even' 
</P>
<P>
Mow's success is all the more remarkable because in the mid-1970s he was out of 
a job and the Securities and Exchange Commission had alleged that he had 
committed fraud by understating losses at a company he headed. Mow always 
denied the allegations, and his deft comeback owes much to something they don't 
teach in business schools. Revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get even," Mow said, his lips tightening. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years ago, Mow was working in what he believed would be his life's 
work, electronics and computers. He ran a promising semiconductor testing 
equipment company that he had founded called Macrodata in Woodland Hills. But 
getting there hadn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
Mow (rhymes with how) was born in China, the son of a Chinese diplomat later 
assigned to the United Nations. When he was 13 the communists swept to power, 
and Mow's parents and five of their sons took refuge in New York. Bill Mow was 
quick at math, and he used that skill to bootstrap his way into electronics in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the mid-1970s Mow's life took another detour. Cutler-Hammer, a 
Milwaukee conglomerate, bought control of Macrodata; within a year, a 
$2-million understatement of losses at Macrodata was discovered, and 
Cutler-Hammer blamed Mow. He was forced to resign a week later as Macrodata's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler-Hammer got in touch with the SEC, which started its own investigation 
and eventually filed a civil lawsuit accusing Mow and other executives of 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing to do with it," Mow said. He later filed suit claiming that it 
was Cutler-Hammer's plan to make him a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
To fight back in court he needed money. To get the money he needed to start a 
new business. "That was the motivation to develop a business," he said. "To 
clear myself and to right the wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Through some fluky twists, Mow got into the clothing trade. His company almost 
went bankrupt a couple of times, and the lingering Macrodata headaches helped 
crack up his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his personal troubles, after a decade and $400,000 in attorneys' fees, 
Mow said, "justice was done." Last year, a California appeals court essentially 
exonerated him, laying the blame for the accounting fraud scheme on 
Cutler-Hammer executives. All other appeals of the case have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Mow has carved out an empire for himself in a chaotic and 
fickle end of the fashion trade. Young people "have got the attention span of a 
flash bulb," said Harry Bernard, a partner with Colton Bernard, a San Francisco 
consulting concern. About five years ago, when designer jeans started to lose 
their chic, Bernard said, "nobody was prepared to give younger kids a jeans 
alternative. Bugle Boy did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inventive Advertising 
</P>
<P>
The company, which imports clothes from about 15 countries including Taiwan and 
China, has made its stamp with reasonable prices (trousers start at $20), 
fast-changing styles and trousers with extra belt loops, jumbo pockets and "as 
many zippers and buttons and snaps as you can find. They captured that 
particular look," Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
Bugle Boy has managed to drive home its message with inventive advertising in 
print and on television and with eye-catching bus stop posters. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mow is branching into men's, children's and women's clothes, and he 
talks of hitting $1 billion in sales within five years. Despite Bugle Boy's 
growth, however, Mow remains relatively unknown outside the apparel industry 
and is usually press-shy. 
</P>
<P>
When it's mentioned that clothing designer Ralph Lauren has achieved not only 
great wealth but great notoriety, Mow laughs. "That's OK," he said. "We sell 
more pants than he does." 
</P>
<P>
Mow's father was chief of the military committee for Chiang Kai-shek's 
Nationalist government and was working at the U.N. when Mao Tse-tung's 
revolution took root. There was never much money after that, so Bill Mow worked 
his way through Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York where he studied 
electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discovered a Market 
</P>
<P>
Later, after working at Honeywell near Boston, he followed his older brother 
Harry Mow -- who worked at the RAND Corp. think tank -- to Los Angeles. He 
eventually saw an opening for selling state-of-the-art semiconductor testing 
equipment and in 1969, Mow opened Macrodata. In five years, the company grew to 
$12 million in sales and counted most of the world's major semiconductor 
manufacturers as customers. 
</P>
<P>
But Mow's life turned in April, 1976, when Cutler-Hammer executives confronted 
him with the alleged fraud and understated losses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Mow signed a consent decree with the SEC, neither admitting nor 
denying the allegations, but prohibiting him from any future violations of 
securities laws. Today, he says he did that "to get the SEC off my back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Victory 
</P>
<P>
Mow sued Cutler-Hammer for fraud, for scheming to buy his company for as little 
as possible by driving down its stock price and for trying to destroy his 
reputation. Several years later the company settled with him out of court. But 
the settlement was contingent, Mow said, upon the outcome of another suit filed 
against Cutler-Hammer -- itself later bought by Eaton Corp. -- by a group of 
Macrodata investors. 
</P>
<P>
That case was concluded last year after a California appeals court upheld a 
$17.6-million judgment against Eaton. The judges ruled that Cutler-Hammer 
executives had intentionally understated Macrodata's loss to pump up the parent 
company's earnings, then blamed the accounting problems on Mow. Mow said Eaton 
paid him $820,000 to end his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen years ago, Mow figured that his scarred reputation would hurt him in 
the computer industry, so he looked for something new. He had relatives in the 
garment trade, and when he met an American who had run a clothing company, Mow 
pulled together $200,000 from a Taiwan investor, put up his house to get a line 
of bank credit and in 1977, Buckeroo International opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
But the first season, the company lost $300,000. At a fashion show that year, 
Mow remembers waiting in a booth for buyers to stop by. Nobody did. A couple of 
years before, Mow recalled, he made a sales pitch for semiconductor gear to 
Siemens executives "and that whole room doesn't sit down till I sit down. Here 
I am sitting in a little booth tackling the buyers to look at the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Powerful Duo 
</P>
<P>
Mow could have used a few more tackles. Several years later, in 1981, his 
company lost $750,000, on sales of $4.1 million, and his marriage broke up. 
</P>
<P>
Mow figured that he had maybe two more seasons to save the company. He changed 
the company's name to Bugle Boy -- after the Yankee kids who played the bugle 
during Civil War battles -- and put Vincent Nesi in charge of sales. (Today 
Nesi is president and owns 10% of the company.) 
</P>
<P>
Mow and Nesi have made a high-octane pair. Nesi joined Mow's company a few 
months after the company opened and has worked his way up. Nesi has a 
reputation in the trade as a rough but savvy merchant. "Nesi is a tough guy to 
do business with, and difficult to work for, but he's a very shrewd marketer," 
Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
After half a decade struggling with the intricacies of the rag trade, by the 
early 1980s Mow had come up with a two-step strategy. "At the right price, you 
can sell anything. And keep it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Bugle Boy started to grow, before almost collapsing in 1984. Parachute pants -- 
baggy trousers made of nylon -- were the rage, and Mow threw everything into 
making them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Turns the Corner 
</P>
<P>
"I cornered the nylon twill market in Taiwan. I virtually put the umbrella 
people out of business that year." But the fad burst, returns piled up, and 
Bugle Boy had a negative net worth of $5 million. Working fast, the company 
brought out a new line of clothes only four months later, and department 
stores, eager to come back from their own parachute losses, filled their 
shelves. By then, Bugle Boy's name had been in front of enough young buyers, 
Mow said, that the brand finally caught on, and with that season the company 
turned the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mow is pushing hard into the older men's market because there are 2 1/2 
times as many men between 25 and 49 than in the 15-to-24 age group. Mow said 
his line of clothing for older men is catching on and has helped Bugle Boy's 
sales surge this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Complaints 
</P>
<P>
But analyst Bernard said it's unclear whether Bugle Boy can duplicate its 
success with young men in the older market. A more immediate chore for Bugle 
Boy is keeping store buyers happy. "Quite frankly, almost every (Bugle Boy) 
order is shipped late," Penney's McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
Mow said department stores are griping, in part, because his clothes are 
selling so fast Bugle Boy "can't keep the pipeline filled." 
</P>
<P>
With Bugle Boy's success, Mow appears to have mellowed. These days much of his 
energy is spent thinking about Levis, not his past. "Over time you develop 
something even better," Mow said. "So you have to let the past go."

Wall Street's blue chips surged Monday to within striking distance of their 
all-time high, powered by the biggest ever single-day gain in the 
transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of UAL Corp. set the mood for the session, soaring 46 1/4 to 210 3/4 
on reports that investor Marvin Davis of Los Angeles was readying a 
$200-a-share-plus bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's run-up and its ripple effects on other airline issues sent the Dow Jones 
index of 20 transportation stocks up a record 94.06 points, or more than 7.5%, 
to 1,344.06. The gain in the 20-share sector was more than double the previous 
largest single-day rise of 46.75 points, set on Oct. 21, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The news prompted buying of other airline stocks. Delta Air Lines climbed 2 3/8 
to 74 1/2, AMR gained 3 1/2 to 71 1/2, USAir Group rose 1 to 51 and Southwest 
Airlines was up 1 at 27. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Confident 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials jumped 41.54 points to 2,694.99, just 
27.43 points shy of the record closing high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 
1987. It also marked the seventh-highest close ever for the market indicator. 
</P>
<P>
Most other broader market measures reached new peaks, having already surpassed 
their 1987 tops. 
</P>
<P>
As the Dow industrials advance toward their all-time peaks, stock analysts are 
generally confident that the rally is broadly enough based that it is not a 
speculative bubble. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the blue chips are lagging the rest of the market, which is a 
good sign. Also, economists point out that while stocks may now be at August, 
1987, levels, corporate earnings are much higher than they were then, so the 
key price-earnings ratio has declined from nearly 20 two years ago to a much 
more reassuring 13. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said traders seemed increasingly confident that a recession could be 
avoided in the months ahead, following an unexpectedly strong report from the 
government Friday on employment in July. 
</P>
<P>
The news pushed interest rates higher in the credit markets, but also evidently 
calmed worries that had been developing among stock traders about a possible 
slump in business conditions and corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
One apparent beneficiary of that change of sentiment was the technology group. 
Hewlett-Packard rose 3 1/8 to 57 1/2, International Business Machines gained 1 
7/8 to 117 3/8 and Digital Equipment advanced 2 3/4 to 98. 
</P>
<P>
In the cyclical basic-industry sector, International Paper gained 2 3/4 to 57, 
Scott Paper was up 1 1/4 to 50 1/4, Alcoa gained 1 1/8 to 72 5/8, Dow Chemical 
gained 2 1/2 to 95 1/2 and Monsanto rose 3 7/8 to 120. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,054 up, 476 down and 465 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 197.58 million shares, up from 
169.75 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 229.58 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,412.012, up 42.321. Large 
blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 4,021, compared to 
3,583 in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices closed broadly lower, responding to the yen's 
depreciation and suggestions that interest rates will not be falling soon. The 
key 225-share Nikkei index lost 111.61 points to close at 34,630.38. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices ended higher. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 
100-share index ended at a session high of 2,341.5, up 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Most bond prices finished slightly lower in edgy trading in anticipation of a 
big supply of new securities to fund government debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was unchanged in price. Its yield, 
which moves in the opposite direction to price, stood at 8.08%. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, bond prices took their biggest dive in about 22 months as 
unexpectedly strong employment data jolted the market. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices started out higher Monday but weakened as the market grew more 
concerned about absorbing the $29.5 billion in new securities that the Treasury 
plans to auction this week, beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush cleared the way for the new debt issue by signing into law 
Monday a $70-billion increase in the federal debt limit, increasing the 
borrowing ceiling to $2.87 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.875%, unchanged from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar edged higher against most key currencies in thin trading, extending 
last week's rally, which stemmed from speculation that interest rates aren't 
likely to decline soon. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery fell to $365.90 an ounce from $367.25 on Friday. Republic 
National Bank of New York said the late bid for gold was $365.20, off $2.30. 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said the dollar continued to be buoyed by Friday's 
better-than-expected employment figures. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
closed at 139.78 Japanese yen, up from 138.05. The dollar closed lower in 
London at 139.47 yen, and higher in New York at 140.05 yen, up from 139.85. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6075, cheaper for buyers than Friday's 
$1.6150. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures prices resumed their downward spiral as analysts learned that 
a summer surge in production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries is even larger than originally feared. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, cotton futures slipped the daily trading limit after two 
listless weeks near the top of their recent price range; sugar futures trended 
lower after tests revealed that some of the Western European crop was in better 
shape than expected, and soybeans staged a modest rally on follow-through 
selling from last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum prices gained some support last week amid concerns that last week's 
hostage crisis could lead to a U.S. military response, which in turn could have 
disrupted the flow of Middle East exports. 
</P>
<P>
But with that situation considered less volatile, traders redirected their 
attention to OPEC overproduction. A respected newsletter pegged July's output 
at 21.8 million barrels per day -- well beyond the cartel's official quota of 
19.5 million, and above even the 21.2 million barrels that some analysts had 
thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil, which had been over $20 a barrel just 13 sessions ago, settled 5 to 
12 cents lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for 
delivery in September at $17.91 a barrel; heating oil settled 0.28 to 0.74 cent 
lower, with September at 48.44 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.24 
to 0.49 cent lower, with September at 49.75 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton futures were 1.45 to 2 cents lower on the New York Cotton Exchange, with 
October at 72.94 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Some rain in Texas over the weekend added to cotton's decline. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures were 0.15 to 0.24 cent lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
with September at 13.94 cents a pound. The first tests of the sugar beet crops 
in West Germany and France revealed both to have higher sugar content than the 
1988 crop. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 2.75 to 5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
September at $3.915 a bushel; corn was 3.5 to 5.25 cents higher, with September 
at $2.2475 a bushel; oats were 1 to 1.5 cents lower, with September at $1.39 a 
bushel, and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 10.75 cents higher, with August at 
$6.015 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Gold was $1.90 to $2 lower on the Comex, with August at $365.90 an ounce; 
silver was 3.7 to 4 cents lower, with August at 512.8 cents an ounce. Platinum, 
traded on the New York Merc, settled $4.50 to $4.70 lower, with September at 
$481.60 an ounce.

cars and their dealers, according to a survey by J. D. Power &amp; Associates. 
It was the third straight year that the car from the Honda Motor Co. luxury 
division topped the survey. Buyers of cars made by West Germany's Mercedes-Benz 
and Japan's Honda and Toyota Motor Corp. followed Acura. The top-ranked 
U.S.-produced car was General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac, in fifth place.

Dataproducts to Sell Headquarters: The computer printer maker tentatively 
agreed to sell its 21.5-acre Woodland Hills headquarters property to Trizec 
Properties Inc. of Canada for $63 million. A New York-based investor group that 
last week made a $273-million takeover bid for Dataproducts -- as well as two 
other bids for part of the company -- struck an earlier deal to sell the 
property to Trizec for $57 million should it succeed in buying Dataproducts. 
Dataproducts Chairman Jack C. Davis said proceeds from the sale would be 
distributed to the firm's shareholders.

T-Bill Rates Climb: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose to 
the highest level in two weeks. The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion in 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.94%, up from 7.65% last 
week. Another $6.6 billion in six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.70%, up from 7.35% last week. The rates were the highest since July 
24, when three-month bills sold for 8.09% and six-month bills averaged 7.73%. 
The discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.21% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,799.30 and 8.12% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,610.70. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve 
said the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for 
making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 7.73% last week, from 
7.86% the previous week.

MCI Accused of Illegal Pricing: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. accused 
its biggest competitor, MCI Corp., of offering large business customers 
illegally low prices to win their long-distance telephone business. AT&amp;T 
officials said they hope that the complaint will lead to a reversal of a 
Federal Communications Commission policy that exempts AT&amp;T competitors from 
having to file papers with the FCC detailing rates and other terms that they 
offer customers. In its complaint to the FCC, AT&amp;T alleged that MCI has 
used unlawful discriminatory discounts the past two years to win contracts with 
the Pentagon, Merrill Lynch and others.

The Japanese economy is estimated to grow a net 5.1% in fiscal 1989, which ends 
next March 31, boosted by brisk capital investment and personal spending, a 
senior official of the Bank of Japan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is likely to continue to be energetic at least until next spring," 
Tatsuya Tamura, director of the central bank's Economic Research and Statistics 
Department, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Tamura based his prediction on healthy capital investment and individual 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The government has projected this year's economic growth at 4%.

HANSON'S $5.6-BILLION BID IS ACCEPTED BY CONS GOLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British industrial conglomerate Hanson PLC won control of Consolidated Gold 
Fields on Monday with a revised $5.6-billion (3.5-billion pound) cash offer for 
the London-based mining giant. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson's investment bank, N. M. Rothschild, said it had acceptances 
representing 57.3% of Cons Gold shares, including 29.6% committed by South 
African-backed Minerals &amp; Resources Corp. after Minorco's own bid for Cons 
Gold failed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cons Gold's board recommended acceptance of the bid after Hanson improved a 
June 22 offer of $4.8 billion (3.1 billion pounds). 
</P>
<P>
The deal ends a protracted battle for control of the West's second-largest gold 
mining company. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco's cash and shares bid, which could have created the West's biggest 
mining concern, was denounced by political opponents who saw it as a South 
African exercise to extend interests abroad. 
</P>
<P>
It finally collapsed in May after a U.S. federal judge dismissed a request by 
Minorco to lift an injunction blocking its bid for Cons Gold, which lapsed the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
Cons Gold and its 49%-owned U.S. associate, Newmont Mining Corp., had filed the 
antitrust proceedings in New York the previous October, saying a Minorco 
takeover of Cons Gold would create a monopoly in the world gold market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Asset Sale 
</P>
<P>
Former socialite Lord Hanson, 67, became an industrialist with a formidable 
reputation on both sides of the Atlantic for buying groups and selling their 
less profitable units to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that he might sell some of Cons Gold's mining interests, 
possibly attracting bids from Minorco for some of its divisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Hanson's products include Jacuzzi whirlpool baths, Ground 
Round restaurants, Farberware cookware and SCM Chemicals. In June, it said it 
would sell most of its stock in Smith Corona typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
The gold industry has shed much of its glamorous image in recent years. For 
Hanson, Cons Gold's crown jewel is probably its Amey Roadstone subsidiary, 
which analysts say would fit easily into its transatlantic business concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Cons Gold, founded by British empire builder Cecil Rhodes, became a takeover 
target last September when Minorco launched its original bid of $4.6 billion 
(2.9 billion pounds).

FIRST INTERSTATE TO SELL LEASING FINANCE UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
ORIX, A JAPANESE FIRM, WILL PAY $190 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
First Interstate Bancorp said Monday that it has agreed to sell Commercial 
Alliance Corp., a subsidiary that finances the leasing of heavy equipment, to a 
Japanese firm for $190 million. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate, parent of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said the unit 
is being sold to ORIX Corp. of Tokyo because it does not fit with its main 
business of consumer banking in the West. In addition, First Interstate said, 
the sale will improve its ratio of capital to assets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restructuring Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Commercial Alliance, based in New York, finances equipment that is leased by 
builders, trucking firms, commercial printers and other users of large 
equipment. The unit, with $1.9 billion in assets, has been a profitable 
business for First Interstate, earning $14.8 million in the year ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The move to sell the subsidiary, which operates from 23 offices throughout the 
country, is part of a strategy that First Interstate announced in late 1987 to 
restructure and put more emphasis on consumer and corporate banking. Since 
then, it has sold about $4 billion in assets, not counting Commercial Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate said ORIX is Japan's biggest leasing company. The sale, which 
must be approved by Japan's Ministry of Finance, is expected to be completed 
later this year.

It hits the switchboard at the small Colorado hospital like machine gun fire. 
All eight lines on operator Betsy Joyce's panel light up. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello. Would you please listen to the following important message," the 
disembodied voice says as she answers the first line, then the second and the 
third . . . every line is the same. 
</P>
<P>
Then the sequence is repeated in the hospital's wards. One after another, a 
computer dials phone numbers sequentially, hitting patient rooms, then 
attacking obstetrics, orthopedics, pediatrics and physicians' offices. Nurses 
scramble down halls trying to answer the calls before a patient jerks out his 
IV tether or sends a heart monitor crashing. 
</P>
<P>
The periodic sieges at Penrose Community Hospital, an 88-bed facility in 
Colorado Springs, happen every month or so and last for hours, sometimes for 
several days in a row. The recorded ads relentlessly pitch various local 
businesses, including a nearby liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
"They're awful," Joyce said. "You can't even argue with it. I've listened 
through to the end several times and said (at the beep): 'You're calling a 
hospital' but that doesn't make any difference. . . . There's nothing I can do. 
I have to answer them. You don't dare not answer." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Congress may be answering, too, as complaints pour in from 
hospitals like Penrose, other emergency services, ordinary businesses and just 
plain citizens who are tired of having their phones -- and increasingly their 
fax machines -- ringing like fire alarms with unsolicited sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
A House committee is expected to vote next month on legislation to restrict 
"junk calls" and "junk fax." Dozens of states, including California, either 
recently have enacted such laws or are considering doing so. 
</P>
<P>
The surging popularity of auto-dialers and fax machines has created a 
technology-spawned confrontation between retailers who use the increasingly 
efficient -- and intrusive -- marketing devices and those on the receiving end 
of the line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an '80s problem," said Steven S. Seltzer, president of Modern 
Communications in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, Seltzer said, a hospital beeper system in 
western Pennsylvania has been tied up at least a half dozen times by an 
auto-dialing computer. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of a transplant candidate, that can be critical," he said. "They 
get a beep, and they think they're going to the hospital, but it's a 
telemarketer trying to play a message. Hospitals can't reach doctors. Life 
hangs in the balance." 
</P>
<P>
But businesses that use auto-dialers and fax machines to market their goods and 
services say that the burgeoning backlash threatens their First Amendment 
rights. They argue that a few bad operators are soiling the whole industry. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers, on the other hand, complain that their right to be left alone is 
rapidly disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a growing level of anger about this," said Chris DePhillips, a 
legislative assistant to Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), a co-sponsor of the House 
bill. Approved by a subcommittee in July, the measure will be taken up by the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee after Congress returns from its recess in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to establish 
standards for automatic dialing systems and fax machines. Calls to hospitals, 
police stations and other emergency services would be illegal. A national 
directory would be compiled listing people who have indicated, perhaps by just 
checking a box on their phone bills, that they don't want to receive 
unsolicited calls or faxes. Violators would be subject to fines of up to 
$10,000 and jail terms of up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Similar bills are working their way through the California Legislature. One 
would forbid telephone companies from selling unlisted numbers to 
telemarketers. Another would require a telemarketer to ask permission before 
playing a recorded message. A third would limit unsolicited faxing between the 
hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. and mandate that all telefaxed messages display a 
toll-free number that could be called to halt future transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Far Enough 
</P>
<P>
None of these measures goes far enough to satisfy some critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's junk fax or junk phone calls . . . we have an absolute right to 
be left alone," said Bob Bulmash, president of Private Citizen, a Chicago-based 
consumer group. "Our right to be left alone is being sapped by technology. Our 
last sanctuary, our home, should be inviolable." 
</P>
<P>
Bulmash said he recently received a letter of support from an 87-year-old woman 
with arthritis, multiple sclerosis and a heart condition who finds it difficult 
to get to the phone. The woman has an unlisted number, Bulmash said, but even 
that can't shield her from computer-driven sales calls. 
</P>
<P>
New York consultant Geri Gantman, however, said that the telemarketing 
industry, which generates an estimated $42 billion annually and supports 1.5 
million marketers with computer-assisted dialing systems, has been taking a bad 
rap. 
</P>
<P>
First, she said, only about one fourth of telemarketing activities involve 
unsolicited calls to people in their homes. And fewer than 1% of those calls 
are made by computers alone, Gantman said, with mostly local companies using 
the random auto-dialers. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Barton, a vice president of the Direct Marketing Assn., calls random 
dialing "a very poor marketing technique." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always surprised it gets any response," Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that much of the trouble is caused by fly-by-night firms that 
indiscriminately use random dialing, the kind of unscrupulous operators who are 
likely to ignore restrictive legislation or fall by the wayside before they can 
be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado Springs hospital may be a case in point. The state already has 
moved to restrict auto-dialing. Switchboard operator Joyce said that some of 
the messages start by saying: "We notice you're in our neighborhood," before 
touting a local retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said that most telemarketers are more circumspect. "I don't think you 
have a problem with the big national companies," he said, "other than that 
people don't like to get phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
Gantman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the misconceptions is that telemarketers don't want to know who doesn't 
want to be called," Gantman said. "We do want to know; it makes everyone 
happier." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the DMA publishes a quarterly list of about 230,000 people who 
have written to the association asking not to be called. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, "We can't promise they'll get no calls at home." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the unsolicited use of fax machines is just as vexing, 
although it does not affect as many people. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the president of an Orange County business that sells fax paper decided 
to lobby the governor of Maryland, who was considering signing one of the 
nation's first bills to ban junk fax. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ridinger, who advertises by sending facsimile transmissions to more than 
500,000 fax users nationwide, sent messages to about 1,200 Maryland businesses, 
asking them to tear off the bottom half, sign it and then fax the form to Gov. 
William Donald Schaefer in Annapolis. 
</P>
<P>
One morning, hundreds of faxes spewed forth from the governor's fax machine, 
choking off virtually all other transmissions for six hours. The effort 
certainly was convincing: it persuaded the governor to sign the bill. The 
measure, which took effect July 1, subjects "fax abusers" to $200 fines. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredibly counterproductive lobbying effort," noted David Iannucci, 
the governor's chief legislative officer, who said that the governor had not 
paid much attention to the bill until that morning. "It demonstrated to us the 
problems that businesses are facing." 
</P>
<P>
But Iannucci said that the message was underscored by the fact that about 20% 
of the faxes had been altered to indicate support for the bill instead of 
opposition. On some of the forms, the message "don't sign this bill" had been 
crossed out and changed to "do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One signer, Iannucci recalled, added a postscript that said, in effect: This is 
bunk. Sign the bill. Stop these guys from using my fax machine as their 
printing press. The actual language was not quite so polite. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen that on a mass mailing before. Usually, if people disagree 
with a solicitation, they throw it in the trash," he said. "These people were 
so bothered that they took the time to change it." 
</P>
<P>
Enough people are bothered by junk fax that more than 20 states are considering 
legislation tougher than the proposed federal law. 
</P>
<P>
But "free faxers" contend that junk fax is a nonproblem, that some of the 
proposed restrictions would hamper routine business practices, that imposing a 
$1,000 fine for a 3-cent fax transmission is ludicrous and that their free 
speech rights are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
With technology developed in the 1970s but not widely used until the early 
1980s, fax machines have exploded in popularity and are now standard office 
equipment. Industry observers estimate that by 1991, more than 5 million fax 
machines will be transmitting more than 60 billion pages a year in the United 
States alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity to abuse it will only worsen," Rep. Christopher Shays 
(R-Conn.) told a House subcommittee in May. (The congressman's comments were 
later faxed to The Times.) 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do they get junk mail, but the postage is due, too," said 
congressional aide Mike Connolly, noting that the receiver pays several cents 
for each sheet of fax paper. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent faxers are understandably nervous. "I have a pro-fax statement I could 
fax you if you request it," said Heather Bante, vice president of Public FAX 
Inc., an Orange County firm that publishes a directory of fax numbers. 
"However, I won't fax it to you unsolicited." 
</P>
<P>
Bante worries that the rising tide of anti-fax sentiment "risks infringing on 
some of our basic constitutional freedoms." And just because a fax transmission 
is unsolicited, Bante said, "doesn't mean it's unwanted." 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we want to do is to send material to people who don't want it," 
said Elliott Segal, a vice president at Mr. Fax in Irvine, the firm behind the 
Maryland lobbying effort and similar attempts to influence legislation in other 
states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
If the ill-fated lobbying attempts proved nothing else, he said, they showed 
that businesses are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to see legislation that tells them what is or is not an 
opportunity to them," Segal said. "One man's junk is another man's 
opportunity."

VOYAGER 2 AIMS TO END TOUR IN GRAND FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grand Tour is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
The venerable Voyager 2 spacecraft is sailing through the back yard of the 
solar system at more than 42,000 m.p.h., closing in on the last encounter of 
the most incredible journey of all. 
</P>
<P>
The automated craft is plunging through an area nearly 3 billion miles away 
where no visitor from Earth has ever been before, aiming toward a spectacular 
flight over the cloud tops of Neptune at 9 p.m. on Aug. 24. No one has ever 
seen Neptune other than as a ball of telescopic fuzz, but by the time Voyager 
is through, thousands of close-up photos and warehouses full of data will have 
been sent back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists will watch the encounter with rapture, knowing that nothing like 
this will happen again for decades, perhaps even centuries. 
</P>
<P>
For many years they will study the images and examine the data and rewrite the 
textbooks as Voyager 2 soars out into the Milky Way to wander among the stars, 
possibly forever. Its twin, Voyager 1, is already on its way to study emissions 
from distant stars, its journey to the planets completed. 
</P>
<P>
For most people, the fantastic flight of the Voyagers will end later this month 
when Voyager 2 whips past Neptune and pays a quick visit to its extraordinary 
moon, Triton. The spacecraft has already discovered four new moons, including 
three announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the electronic camera that has allowed armchair scientists to tour the 
solar system's four outer planets will soon grow quiet, ending a 12-year 
odyssey that is without parallel. 
</P>
<P>
"The picture show will be over," said Edward C. Stone, vice president of 
Caltech and chief scientist on the Voyager project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fitting End 
</P>
<P>
The Neptune encounter should be spectacular, and many of those final pictures 
will be shown live on television, providing a fitting end for a most unusual 
spacecraft. The one-ton Voyager is the most sophisticated robot ever built, 
composed of 65,000 parts, including an on-board computer that has the 
electronic circuitry equivalent to 2,000 color TV sets. In recent years, 
Voyager 2 has been electronically rebuilt by controllers at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena as it sailed through the solar system, making 
photography possible under circumstances comparable to taking pictures in a 
dark cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The craft's computer is sophisticated enough for the Voyager to heal itself 
when trouble arises. It can even shut off important electronic parts during 
times of radiation peril, or freeze its orientation toward Earth if for some 
reason it appears in danger of drifting into a position where contact with 
Mission Control would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Stone expects the two Voyagers to send scientific data on the composition of 
interstellar space back to Earth for another quarter of a century, but there 
will be no more Neptunes, no more moons like Jupiter's Io with its potent 
volcanoes, no more mad dashes through the rings of Saturn. It will be the 
middle of the 22nd Century before the outer planets once again present 
themselves in such an alignment that would make a similar mission possible. 
</P>
<P>
Neptune will grow ever dimmer as Voyager 2 dips below the ecliptic plane in 
which the planets travel around the sun, signaling the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sad Day 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sad," admitted Charles E. Kohlhase, who for the last 14 years 
has worried about every detail of the mission. As manager of the Voyager 
mission planning office at JPL, Kohlhase well remembers the early days when he 
and his colleagues wondered among themselves: "Is this really going to work?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet work it did, "better than any of us expected," Stone observed. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of that fact was underscored by astronomer Carl Sagan, a member 
of the Voyager's imaging team, during a recent speech to JPL employees. 
</P>
<P>
"This will surely be in the history books 1,000 years from now," Sagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Voyager is a unique event in solar system exploration," he added. "But an era 
is drawing to an end." 
</P>
<P>
The climax is not without peril, however. Even a small piece of dust could 
severely damage Voyager during its daringly close flyby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antenna Network 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the encounter with Neptune, 38 different antennas on four continents 
will be used to receive transmissions from Voyager. Many of them have been 
enlarged, and some have been tied together to form a network of antennas to 
monitor the weak signal. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of both Voyager missions is about $865 million, according to 
Kohlhase. 
</P>
<P>
That means the Grand Tour, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
likes to call it, has cost every American 20 cents per year, he added. And in 
12 short years it has produced more information about the solar system than had 
been learned throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
Although this month will bring the end of the planetary odyssey, Voyager will 
go out in spectacular form. Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
* Neptune is 2.71 billion miles away, so far that Voyager will be on its own 
throughout the close encounter. It will take four hours and six minutes for 
Voyager's radio transmissions, traveling at 186,000 miles per second, to reach 
Earth. That means that if an object should suddenly loom in Voyager's path as 
it zips past Neptune at 17 miles per second, the spacecraft would have hit it 
hours before ground controllers even learn of the danger. There will be no 
opportunity to correct its course from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
* Voyager is so distant that by the time its radio signal reaches Earth it will 
be reduced to the strength of only one ten-quadrillionth of a watt. That is 20 
billion times weaker than the power used to operate a digital wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
* The amount of sunlight that reaches Neptune is about 1,000 times less than 
that reaching Earth, making it extremely difficult to capture clear images. So 
engineers have come up with a system that will allow the entire spacecraft to 
"nod" so that its camera can remain fixed on the target as the craft speeds 
past, permitting longer exposures. Each electronic image will be composed of 
more than 5 million bits of data, so as the craft whips past Neptune it will 
create a continuous string of data nearly 3 billion miles long, reaching back 
to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
* Voyager will pass within 3,000 miles of Neptune's north pole, closer than it 
has come to any other object in the solar system. That is, quite literally, 
right over the cloud tops. 
</P>
<P>
* Neptune's gravitational pull at that close range will change Voyager's course 
by 90 degrees, sending it off to encounter one of the strangest objects in the 
solar system five hours later. Voyager is to pass 24,000 miles from the surface 
of Triton, which is about the size of Earth's moon but a very different body 
indeed. Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that travels 
backwards, orbiting Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. 
Scientists think they know why, and Voyager should tell them if they are right. 
</P>
<P>
* By the time Voyager passes Neptune, 11,000 man years will have been devoted 
to the mission, according to JPL's Kohlhase. 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager program was initially funded to study only the planets Jupiter and 
Saturn. Two spacecraft were provided so that if one failed, the other could 
complete the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager 2 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center atop a Titan-Centaur 
rocket on Aug. 20, 1977. Sixteen days later Voyager 1 was launched on a shorter 
trajectory, so the second spacecraft arrived at the two planets first, reaching 
Jupiter on March 5, 1979, and Saturn on Nov. 12, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voyager 1 Pays Price 
</P>
<P>
Voyager 1 passed close to the two planets while Voyager 2 remained at a safer 
distance. Both encounters by both spacecraft were an enormous success, but 
Voyager 1 paid a price -- it passed through an intense radiation belt 
surrounding Jupiter, and several instruments aboard the craft were severely 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had been riding the spacecraft you would have received a lethal dose of 
radiation," Kohlhase said. In fact, he added, the amount of radiation would 
have been 1,000 times greater than humans can endure. 
</P>
<P>
So a somewhat crippled Voyager 1 was allowed to end its planetary sojourn and 
zip on out toward the stars. But Voyager 2 was still in excellent condition, 
just as it is all these years later, and mission planners at JPL did not want 
to let go. 
</P>
<P>
NASA agreed to provide funding for the rest of the Grand Tour, and Voyager 2 
used the gravitational field of Saturn to fling itself out toward Uranus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Date With Miranda 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 24, 1986, Voyager 2 zipped passed Uranus, but the planet itself ended 
up being upstaged by one of its moons, Miranda. Miranda, it turned out, had 
strange contours on its surface that to this day have not been fully explained. 
</P>
<P>
Like Uranus, Neptune may well end up playing second fiddle. The planet will 
appear bluish in color because of the methane in its atmosphere, and it will 
have more atmospheric texture than Uranus. But since it is essentially a huge 
ball of hydrogen and helium gas, there are no surface features to observe other 
than clouds. There will never be a "landing" on Neptune, because there is no 
land. 
</P>
<P>
But Triton, Neptune's largest moon, is another story entirely and it has 
fascinated scientists ever since it was discovered in 1846 -- just one month 
after Neptune itself was detected. A smaller moon, Nereid, was discovered in 
1949, and Voyager has since found four more. That, however, is not very many 
moons compared to the other great planets, and that shortage has long troubled 
scientists because they can see no reason why Neptune should have so few. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrong-Way Moon 
</P>
<P>
Once every 5.88 days, Triton completes an orbit around Neptune, but it travels 
in the wrong direction. Moons form in the equatorial plane around planets, and 
in all other cases they move in the direction of the planet's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"When planets form they have a disk and small satellites, and small satellites 
orbit in the same direction as the planet," said Stone, who has been the 
Voyager's chief scientist throughout the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Triton traveling in the opposite direction in a cockeyed orbit that 
carries it far above and below the planet's equator? 
</P>
<P>
A team of Caltech scientists led by astrophysicist Peter Goldreich have argued 
that Triton is not a natural part of the Neptunian system at all and that the 
reddish-brown moon was actually a chunk of rock and ice wandering through the 
solar system that collided with one of Neptune's moons. That spectacular 
collision would have destroyed the other satellite and sent Triton careening 
off on a very irregular orbit, so the argument goes. 
</P>
<P>
If Triton was a wandering "planetesimal" that collided with a Neptunian 
satellite, it would have entered a highly elliptical orbit, passing as close as 
five Neptune radii from the planet and then moving out to more than 100 radii 
in an elongated orbit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping a Path 
</P>
<P>
That irregular orbit would have caused Triton to sweep through those altitudes, 
smashing into any other moons that happened to be in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Triton would have devoured the regular satellite system, other than those that 
are closer than about five radii," Goldreich said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Triton's orbit would grow circular, but not before "almost any 
object in its path would have been destroyed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, which probably lasted up to a billion years, Triton would 
have been subjected to immense stresses due to the changes in Neptune's 
gravitational pull as the moon plunged close to the planet, and then zipped 
far, far away. The stresses, called "tidal forces," would have been great 
enough to liquefy the core of the satellite, and possibly its surface. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager should reveal whether this theory is true, according to both Stone and 
Goldreich. Furthermore, anyone who follows Voyager's discoveries during August 
will have a chance to test the theory for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test of Theory 
</P>
<P>
If that scenario is correct, Voyager should not find new moons between five and 
100 radii of Neptune. The four that have been discovered so far are in orbits 
close to the planet and would not have been affected by Triton's grand sweep. 
</P>
<P>
It would be an immense problem for the theory if Voyager discovered a lot of 
moons in the area that Triton should have swept clear, but at this point that 
appears improbable. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if Triton was liquefied during the time when it would have been 
sweeping up other moons, there should be far fewer craters on its surface than 
on other moons throughout the solar system. Thus the surface of Triton should 
be reasonably smooth, although some cratering could have occurred after the 
surface hardened. 
</P>
<P>
If the surface of Triton is indeed much smoother than the surface of the 
Earth's moon, and if a spate of new moons are not discovered beyond five radii, 
chalk one up for the theorists and think of Triton as a captured wanderer. 
</P>
<P>
But if Triton is heavily cratered and many other moons are discovered circling 
Neptune, scratch Goldreich, et al., and look for another explanation for 
Triton's peculiarities. That, however, is considered unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than a Rock 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is right, Voyager's view of Triton should be sensational. 
Evidence suggests that Triton has pools of frozen nitrogen on its surface, so 
this should not be just a dull hunk of rock orbiting a distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Voyager has to get there and, despite its success record over 
the last 12 years, the rest of the journey is not without hazards. Scientists 
believe there should be little debris in Voyager's path. But no one can be 
absolutely certain of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We are barreling in there really close," said JPL's Kohlhase. "We think we are 
outside the rings, and above the atmosphere. But are we going to make it? Are 
we running out of good fortune?" 
</P>
<P>
Only Voyager knows for sure.

U.S., MEXICO BASKING IN NEW ERA OF WARMER TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For almost two centuries, the United States and Mexico have lived as uneasy 
neighbors, trapped in a tangled relationship marked by bickering, 
misunderstanding and sometimes war. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, a new, more conciliatory tone has overcome the habitual frictions 
between the two countries -- and it was on ample display Monday in a top-level 
meeting that produced an outpouring of enthusiasm on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to a new relationship," U.S. Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III said. "From now on, we will define the U.S.-Mexican relationship not 
by the narrow differences which divide us, but by the growing agenda of common 
opportunities that unite us as never before." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Fernando Solana agreed, citing the "high level of 
maturity and warmth" between the two governments. He said the level of accord 
is "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
From drugs to debt, issues that once created a wide gulf between the two 
neighbors, Mexico and the United States are in unusual accord. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials and Mexican political analysts attribute the improved 
relationship to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has taken a range of 
national and international policy positions urged on Mexico by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Mexico's traditional anti-Yanqui rhetoric and Washington's chronic 
Mexico-bashing have been replaced by mutual compliments and promises of good 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, noting the long history of friction between the two neighbors, 
warn that this era of good feelings may well be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all honey on cornflakes," said Mexican pundit Adolfo Aguilar Zinser. "The 
Mexican government has made a decision to avoid conflict at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Array of Changes 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, change is evident across the entire, complex range of 
U.S.-Mexican relations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In narcotics trafficking, the Bush Administration credits Salinas with 
cracking down on drug kingpins -- and corrupt Mexican officials -- with more 
resolve than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In economic policy, Mexico gave U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady 
his first major success in negotiating a debt reduction agreement last month, 
and Salinas has sought to encourage both private enterprise and foreign 
investment -- a shift especially dear to the hearts of Bush aides. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In foreign policy, Salinas has quietly dropped Mexico's opposition to U.S. 
policy in Central America and has cooperated with U.S. efforts to put 
diplomatic pressure on Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting brought together five U.S. Cabinet officers -- the largest 
such delegation ever -- and six Mexican Cabinet ministers in a daylong 
conference that produced agreements to crack down on drug money laundering in 
Mexico, build two new bridges across the Rio Grande, and speed up efforts to 
build a joint sewage treatment plant on the U.S. side of the border between San 
Diego and Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fighting' Issues 
</P>
<P>
More important, U.S. and Mexican officials said, this was the first such 
meeting in memory that was not dominated by squabbles over drugs, immigration 
or other immediate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-Mexican relations used to be defined by the issues we were fighting 
about," a senior American official said. "We've turned the corner on that. . . 
. We're building a relationship that you could actually call normal." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides apparently were so determined to pursue the new good relationship 
that they touched only briefly on potentially divisive issues such as the U.S. 
demand for the right to pursue drug traffickers into Mexico and U.S. 
immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's shift toward Washington appears to be a product of the Salinas 
government's pressing need for economic assistance, relief from a crushing 
foreign debt of more than $100 billion, and Salinas' own search for political 
legitimacy after his election last year, whose fairness was widely questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"This change has taken place at the initiative of Mexico before the Bush 
Administration even decided how it wanted to conduct the relationship," Aguilar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the first few months of the two new administrations were dominated by 
old-style misunderstandings -- over the naming of U.S. Ambassador John D. 
Negroponte, initially viewed here as a would-be "proconsul," over Salinas' 
appointment of a high police official wanted for crimes in San Diego, and over 
American plans to build a border ditch to keep out illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mutual Effort 
</P>
<P>
But since February, both governments have made a concerted effort to reduce 
tensions -- and have largely succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said Salinas wants to avoid conflict with Washington for three reasons: 
Mexico's private sector sees good relations with the United States as a sign of 
the government's pro-business sentiment; friction with Washington would reopen 
controversy in the United States over the stability of Mexico's political 
system, and confrontation would mean less economic support from the U.S. 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Bush Administration has committed itself publicly to supporting 
Salinas -- as a highly visible test case of whether following U.S. advice can 
indeed rescue slumping Third World economies. 
</P>
<P>
"I take my hat off to the Salinas administration," Treasury Secretary Brady 
told reporters here Monday. Brady especially praised Salinas for his policies 
-- long urged by Washington -- of encouraging domestic private enterprise and 
welcoming foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said those policies and the recently-concluded debt reduction agreement 
had attracted so much capital into Mexico that a planned $2-billion U.S. bridge 
loan may be "less necessary than it was before."

BRADLEY TRAFFIC PLAN FACES A ROADBLOCK BY TRUCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy lobbying by the state's trucking industry is threatening to kill Mayor 
Tom Bradley's long-sought plan to ban trucks from crowded city streets during 
peak traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
Truckers are wielding their considerable political clout in the City Council 
and the state Legislature in a two-front war to have the proposed ban killed 
outright, or to have the state preempt the city's right to have such a law. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed truck ban is the linchpin of an initiative announced by Bradley 
two years ago to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. The ban is the 
last major unadopted element of the plan, and Bradley is pulling out all the 
stops to make it a reality. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of his own inauguration ceremony in June, Bradley took time out 
for a phone call from Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) to map 
strategy for foiling a legislative maneuver by the truckers. 
</P>
<P>
The fight is nothing less than a showdown between Bradley, one of the state's 
most visible politicians, and the California Trucking Assn., one of the state's 
most combative and effective lobbying groups. 
</P>
<P>
And while there have been battles won by both sides in early skirmishes, the 
war is expected to be a lengthy and ugly confrontation in which the state's 
leading politicians will have to take sides. 
</P>
<P>
"This is big for Los Angeles, and this is big for the truckers and those are 
two very big constituencies," said one Sacramento lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's plan would prohibit 70% of trucks in a fleet from operating during 
the peak weekday hours of 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through 
Friday. Truckers would have to register with the city, pay a $60 annual permit 
fee and prove that their vehicles are in safe working order. The 
owner-operators of single trucks would be required to pick one rush period -- 
they could drive in either the morning or evening rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
The program would be limited to trucks with three axles or more and a gross 
weight of more than 26,000 pounds. The ban would only apply to surface streets 
because the city does not have jurisdiction over freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the plan would cut rush-hour traffic on city streets by an 
average of 5% to 10%, according to a 1988 Caltrans study. In some areas, the 
impact would be much greater. In downtown, for instance, trucks represent up to 
9.6% of all morning rush hour traffic, and in the harbor district, trucks are 
estimated to account for 14% to 17% of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bicker, Bradley's chief aide on transportation, contends that since each 
truck takes as much roadway as three cars, cutting trucks by 10% could reduce 
overall congestion by 20% to 30%. Perhaps more important than the sheer numbers 
is the nature of the vehicles being reduced: Trucks are involved in 50% of all 
traffic-delaying incidents, according to the Caltrans study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Truckers Respond 
</P>
<P>
The truckers have a simple response to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city's being damned unfair," said Tom Schumacher, executive vice 
president of the trucking association, a trade organization that represents an 
estimated 87% of the state's truckers. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher maintains that the Los Angeles plan unfairly deprives truckers of 
the right to use public roadways. "The city gets the benefit of our taxes, and 
then they want to ban us from the streets," complained Schumacher in a recent 
interview. Shifting schedules and idling trucks for hours a day will 
dramatically increase the cost of goods and threaten prompt deliveries of 
everyday commodities, said the man who is directing the lobbying effort against 
the ban. 
</P>
<P>
One measure of the importance of the proposed ban is the priority Schumacher 
has assigned to it. "Every year there are 700 bills that affect us. We zero in 
on just four or five," he said. And this year, the truck ban is at the top of 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a nice fighter, but I am effective," Schumacher added. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's strategy is to bottle up the measure in a City Council committee 
while he engineers a state law preemption of the proposal. He already has 
allies in combative Councilman Nate Holden, a Bradley foe, and state Sen. 
William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). 
</P>
<P>
The battle on both fronts is likely to intensify later this month as the 
Legislature considers a bill to keep local governments from regulating truck 
traffic and city officials press for a hearing of the truck ban before the full 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Chamber of Commerce is "running point," as Schumacher put 
it, for the truckers, and it has assembled a coalition of construction 
equipment firms, restaurants and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
Producers. 
</P>
<P>
At the state level, truckers have in recent weeks been joined by the powerful 
California Grocers Assn. The grocers gained the respect of many political 
observers last year when, in just one month's time, they raised $20 million in 
a successful effort to defeat Proposition 95 -- a ballot measure that would 
have imposed fines on health and safety code violations. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley has also recruited potent allies as he pulled together Los Angeles' 
sizable contingent of state representatives. In the Assembly, Bradley has lined 
up Waters, a respected legislative arm-twister with close ties to Speaker 
Willie Brown. In the Senate, the city fight is being led by President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' effort is being complicated by the politics of a sweeping 
transportation construction and fuel tax program introduced earlier this year 
by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
In order to get the program through the Legislature, proponents had to 
negotiate with major transportation groups -- and truckers were seated at the 
head of the bargaining table. Truckers agreed not to oppose the measures but -- 
according to legislators who were at the meetings -- they wanted something in 
return: a state law preventing Los Angeles from enacting its proposed truck ban 
and guaranteeing that other communities could not have similar bans. 
</P>
<P>
So in July Campbell introduced a bill that would bar cities and counties from 
licensing or collecting fees on trucks. No truck traffic could be regulated by 
a city alone; any such regulation could be done only on a "regional" basis. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the Los Angeles ban say the state measure would effectively kill 
their plan. "It would put it off for four years minimum," said Bicker. "And all 
the while, congestion will get worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a pure gift to the truckers," said Dwight Stenbakken, a lobbyist for the 
League of California Cities, which is backing Los Angeles on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Schumacher said, "We're asking them to be fair." If the Campbell bill is 
defeated, he added, "it's a deal breaker" on the governor's construction 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said truckers "are taking a heavy hit" in taxes and fees in the 
transportation construction package "and all they ask in return is not to be 
hit with more fees locally and to have some consistency and uniformity. . . . 
That seems to me to be a reasonable request." 
</P>
<P>
Waters is equally adamant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all working too hard to fight traffic congestion in Los Angeles . . . 
to have (the efforts) preempted by the state," Waters said. If Campbell made 
commitments to the truckers, she added, "then he should honor those 
commitments. And I will honor mine. And that is to kill this bill." 
</P>
<P>
The bill is waiting consideration by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, 
where the vote is expected to be close. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, the Bradley plan is facing an equally uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the ban -- which would establish a staff to work out details 
for the truck ban -- unanimously cleared both the council's Transportation and 
the Finance and Revenue committees earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headed for Debate 
</P>
<P>
But, just as it headed for debate later this month by the full council, 
Transportation Committee chairman Holden began trying to get the measure back 
to his committee. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, who ran against Bradley in a bitter mayoral campaign last spring, said 
the shower of complaints he got after the committee vote made him change his 
mind and decide to oppose the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The heavens and earth have opened" with protests from a broad spectrum of 
business interests, Holden said, while an aide displayed a stack of business 
cards from those who have contacted him to fight the truck ban. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he called Campbell and told him a state law would be unnecessary 
"because I'll kill the (truck ban) right here." 
</P>
<P>
Holden said the Bradley proposal is unworkable, unenforceable and ultimately 
would be ineffective. He said he envisions scores of big rigs backed up at the 
city limits, waiting for rush hour to pass. And he anticipates delivery delays 
and shortages of goods if the plan is adopted without the cooperation of 
neighboring cities and counties. 
</P>
<P>
At a council Transportation Committee hearing Holden arranged for on Wednesday, 
speakers representing businesses from restaurants to construction firms to film 
producers said night deliveries would be more expensive as workers are paid 
premium wages and could be more dangerous in poor light. A lobbyist for the 
motion picture producers said their shooting schedules are often dictated by 
the position of the sun, and cannot be delayed by rush hour traffic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he will try to keep the full council from voting on the truck ban, 
but it is unclear whether he can do that. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that both Bradley forces and these business groups will step 
up their lobbying of council members and state legislators in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As Assembly Transportation Committee chairman Richard Katz (D-Los Angeles) put 
it, "It's going to be a long summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BRADLEY'S TRUCK TRAFFIC PLAN 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1988, Mayor Bradley announced a program to reduce by half the 
number of trucks on Los Angeles streets during peak traffic hours, primarily by 
shifting more shipping operations into the night. Under the proposed law: 
</P>
<P>
1. An identification system would ban from city streets 70% of large-fleet 
trucks that normally operate workdays during the peak hours of 6-9 a.m. and 4-7 
p.m. This would also affect 125,000 construction workers who drive their cars 
to job sites in Los Angeles. Owner-operators of single trucks could operate 
during one peak period per day but not both. 
</P>
<P>
2. Trucks that deliver hot asphalt, concrete and structural steel would be 
exempted. 
</P>
<P>
3. A rapid deployment force -- consisting of helicopters and heavy-duty tow 
trucks, would be stationed throughout the city to quickly remove truck 
accidents from major traffic arteries. 
</P>
<P>
4. Large shippers and receivers would be required, through regulations 
established with the Air Quality Management District, to operate at least four 
hours between the off-peak hours of 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. Strict guidelines to 
limit noise associated with off-hour deliveries would be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
5. An arbitration, evaluation and research board would be formed under the 
mayor's proposal to decide on exemptions from the truck program on a 
case-by-case basis. The board, consisting of representatives from the city, the 
AQMD, community groups, and shipping, receiving and trucking companies, would 
constantly evaluate the success of the program and provide regular reports to 
the mayor on his goal of reducing truck traffic by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
6. The program would be limited to trucks with three or more axles and a gross 
weight of more than 26,000 pounds.

About 70 members of a Mohawk Indian band opposed to gambling on their 
reservation staged a quiet demonstration outside a polling station as residents 
began two days of voting on whether to allow casinos on their land. The 
protesters picketed the tribal council building, demanding a halt to the 
referendum, which they said was illegal and in violation of tribal law. At a 
meeting Saturday of the tribal council, members voted to postpone the vote 
indefinitely until a mechanism could be found for traditional Mohawks and those 
on the Canadian side of the reservation to express their views on the gambling 
issue.

Thunderstorms with lightning but no rain moved toward western and central 
Idaho, where flames have already charred 105,000 acres. The Boise Interagency 
Fire Center, the national fire coordination center, said 23,000 firefighters 
were battling the worst of the fires on 182,000 acres, primarily in Idaho, 
Oregon and California. The center said the war has already cost over $27 
million. More than 220,000 acres have been charred in a bout of mostly 
lightning-caused fires that began July 26. More than 3,000 lightning strikes 
were reported overnight in fire-plagued areas of the West.

With 16 days to go before the Aug. 23 deadline for challenging insurance 
company requests to be exempted from Proposition 103 rate rollbacks, Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie was asked by consumer groups to call for 
additional rollback hearings. Although the language of the proposition is 
ambiguous, Gillespie's office and the consumer groups say companies for which 
hearings are not called by the deadline probably will be legally deemed to have 
won their exemptions. So far, Gillespie has called for hearings on only seven 
companies and has tentatively ordered $305 million in rollbacks. Harvey 
Rosenfeld, chairman of the Voter Revolt group, asked Gillespie to call hearings 
for all 445 companies that have applied for exemptions. Gillespie's office said 
more hearings will be called, but it did not say how many.

A Soviet oil tanker is feared to have sunk off the northern Philippines, and 
initial reports said 16 people are missing and that 12 have been rescued. The 
Manila Rescue Coordinating Center said the ship was identified as the Vishru, 
which sent a distress message Sunday saying it was leaking and listing badly. A 
reconnaissance plane from the U.S. Navy base at Subic Bay circled the area but 
found no trace of the ship, the center said. A center spokesman, citing U.S. 
military reports, said that another Soviet vessel picked up 12 survivors.

ON CALIFORNIA: RAVENS RAP ON A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
For those who bring a ghoulish curiosity to their scrutiny of Southern 
California's environmental decay, I offer the case of the raven. The evolution 
of the raven to Frankenstein status may not be a major milepost of our decline, 
but it's a sign of something. You might put the raven in the same league with 
the solemya clam. 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseurs of this sort of thing will recall that the solemya clam was 
discovered thriving in the sewage sludge at the bottom of Santa Monica Bay. 
Long after other marine life had been extinguished by the soup of heavy metals 
and petrochemicals deposited there by the city, the clam could be seen sliding 
through the muck, contentedly gulping gaseous sulfur bubbling up from the goo. 
The solemya clam had a talent for adapting. 
</P>
<P>
And so too does the raven. In fact, both creatures are interesting because they 
have turned environmental filth to their own, personal advantage. But whereas 
the clam was content with its lot down there in the sludge, the raven has 
proven more ambitious. First it took over the Mojave. And now the raven may be 
headed for the city. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as the 1940s, ravens were rarely encountered in the Mojave or 
elsewhere in Southern California. A larger cousin to the crow, ravens are part 
scavenger and part predator, and most likely they found the pickings slim in 
the untrammeled desert. 
</P>
<P>
The desert, of course, was not destined to stay untrammeled for very long. Even 
in the 1940s, a pattern of degradation had become apparent. The Mojave was 
losing its large, grassy regions and becoming a drier, harsher place. As the 
savanna areas disappeared, they were replaced by the sage and thistle-covered 
sand we see today. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible this decay was caused by over-grazing, though no one is certain. 
In any case, that change was just the beginning. New roads began to crisscross 
the desert and towns sprang up. Each town developed what is delicately called a 
disposal problem, and soon there was a corresponding landfill site and sewage 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this would hardly qualify the Mojave for Bhopal status. But in the desert, 
small shifts in the environment tend to get magnified, and that's what happened 
in the Mojave. A window of opportunity had been created for the raven. 
</P>
<P>
Each new road turned into a prolific producer of flat rodents, snakes and 
birds. The ravens began to patrol the roads in sorties, looking for the dead 
and dying. If they tired of road kills, they could fly to the nearest dump for 
some soggy Cheez-its. And there were always the sewage ponds. Whole flocks 
gathered on the spray arms, waiting for tasty bits of effluent to shoot out. 
The Mojave, once an austere place for the raven, had been turned into a food 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Cardiff, an ornithologist with San Bernardino County, watched the 
transformation take place. He says it's hard to imagine a creature better 
suited to exploit the opportunity. The raven is big, strong and, perhaps most 
important, intelligent. Certain individuals have been described in scientific 
journals as being capable of crude tool use. Not your ordinary bird. 
</P>
<P>
And exploit is just what the raven did. In the last 20 years, its population 
has grown 1,528% in the Mojave, and the raven has now taken over large chunks 
of the desert. This spring the Bureau of Land Management proposed shooting 
ravens because they were eating the desert tortoise into extinction. In some 
desert valleys, Cardiff says, few finches or wrens or small rodents or even 
lizards are left because the ravens have got them all. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiff, who talks about the raven with a mixture of awe and horror, believes 
their population probably has leveled off in the desert. There are only so many 
nest sites out there, and most are being used, he says. For the raven 
population to grow further, it must expand its territory. 
</P>
<P>
This possibility intrigues Cardiff. He believes a logical next step for the 
raven would be Los Angeles. After all, he says, the city offers garbage and 
sewage in huge abundance, not to mention many flat cats and flat dogs. The only 
thing standing in the way of a raven takeover is the crow, the raven's smaller 
relative now doing very well in the city. 
</P>
<P>
So far there's no convincing evidence of a big move on L.A. by the ravens. But 
sightings in the city have increased. There's a few along the river, and one 
pair on the UCLA campus. The UCLA ravens skulk around the campus trees, staring 
balefully at the crows. These birds might be nothing more than raven 
adventurists, of course, or undesirables kicked out of the main population. And 
then again, they just might be scouts.

WATER EXPORTS SEEN AS THREAT TO STRIPED BASS 
</P>

Striped bass in San Francisco Bay have diminished to such a low level that the 
species will not survive here unless water shipped to Central and Southern 
California is cut drastically, environmentalists said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists said this year's relatively rainy spring should have 
resulted in greatly increased numbers of striped bass, a popular sport fish in 
the bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
But as it turned out, there was only a minor increase from 1988, the worst year 
on record. The count taken by the Department of Fish and Game during the spring 
spawn was the second lowest since the state started keeping records in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
"For all practical purposes, there was no successful spawn," said John 
Beuttler, executive director of United Anglers of California, a sportfishing 
group. Environmentalists blame the decline on the fact that diversions from the 
delta cut the fresh water spawning grounds that striped bass require. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the latest so-called striped bass index come as the California Water 
Resources Board prepares to resume hearings this fall to determine how to 
divide up the state's water. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's press conference at the Berkeley Marina, environmentalists from 
such groups as the Natural Resources Defense Council fired prehearing salvos by 
calling for a 1.5-million-acre-foot reduction of water shipped to Central 
Valley farmers and Southern California municipalities each year. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Nelson of the Save San Francisco Bay Assn. declared that the species has 
"collapsed." He called for a moratorium on additional diversions south and for 
more conservation by Central Valley farmers, who use upward of 83% of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Water users reacted harshly to the environmentalists' latest call for a cutback 
in diversions. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes them think that (reduced diversion) will benefit the fish? There's 
not even agreement among the biologists," said Jason Peltier, manager of the 
Central Valley Project Water Assn., which represents 80 local water districts 
that draw on delta water. 
</P>
<P>
David Schuster, a consultant to the state water contractors, including the 
Metropolitan Water District, termed the charges "a lot of grandstanding." He 
agreed that the species is "in big trouble" but said the decline in striped 
bass is an "indication" of environmental problems in the delta, not the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend the striped bass is an indicator of the health of the 
bay and delta. The coalition pointed to declines in salmon runs, shrimp and 
delta smelt to buttress the contention. 
</P>
<P>
But other experts note that some species, such as sturgeon, are not in decline. 
Another indication of improved bay water quality is that shellfish such as 
clams can be picked legally along some sections of the bay's shore. 
</P>
<P>
Still, state fisheries experts believe that one explanation for the decline in 
bass is that roughly 6 million acre-feet of fresh water is shipped from the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Central and Southern California for 
residential and agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
These biologists believe the diversion cuts into the population by sucking 
young bass from the delta, and by reducing the amount of fresh water that flows 
into and flushes San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that it (water diversion) is a major thing affecting the 
environment," said Donald Stevens, a state Fish and Game supervisor who works 
on the bass problem. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what has caused the decline is cause for debate. Besides water 
diversion, one hypothesis is that there simply are fewer adult striped bass 
left to spawn than there were 20 years ago. The adult population, once 
estimated to be 1.6 million, has dropped to 800,000 to 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
A second theory is that the main food of young bass, a crustacean called the 
eurytemora, is declining for an unknown reason. New species of the crustacean 
have become more abundant, but they are able to escape hungry young bass. 
</P>
<P>
Still another theory attributes the decline to toxicity. Adult bass are 
burdened with varying levels of heavy metals and petroleum byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
To supplement the fishery, the state has created hatcheries. A study due out 
this year will attempt to come up with a long-range plan for the bass. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can take striped bass and say the whole system has gone to 
pot," Stevens said. "But what has happened is an indication of environmental 
problems in the system."

4TH SUSPECT IN UPLAND BOY'S MURDER IS DEPUTY'S SON

When Mike Kasbeck returned home from a family camping trip Sunday and turned on 
the nightly news, he got a real jolt. Just hours earlier, the broadcast 
reported, 19-year-old Wayne Hobbs had surrendered to police and was being held 
on suspicion of abducting and murdering a young Upland boy. 
</P>
<P>
Kasbeck, 15, instantly concluded that police had the wrong guy. Hobbs was his 
neighbor, his buddy, an idol of sorts with whom he shared an interest in 
snakes, skateboarding and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs is the son of a San Bernardino County deputy sheriff, a kid who spent 
several years as a sheriff's explorer cadet and once thought of pursuing a 
career in police work himself. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs was not, his friend was quite sure, a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't do something like this. It's just not him," Kasbeck said Monday, 
sitting on the curb along the peaceful Upland cul-de-sac where Hobbs and his 
parents also live. "I mean, I've seen him pick up a bird with a broken wing, 
take care of it and then let it go." 
</P>
<P>
Kasbeck's expressions of disbelief were echoed Monday by others who know Hobbs, 
the last of four Upland teen-agers arrested in connection with the mysterious 
death of 9-year-old Jason Matthew Lea. 
</P>
<P>
Jason's nude, partially decomposed body was found at the foot of a cliff near 
the Mt. Baldy ski area on Friday. The slight, brown-haired youngster vanished 
July 29 after leaving home to take an evening bicycle ride. 
</P>
<P>
Few details about the puzzling case have been released, but authorities have 
suggested that the four youths in custody acted in concert in abducting Jason, 
who had been seen with several teenagers at a video arcade and a bowling alley 
on Foothill Boulevard the night he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hobbs, 18-year-old Richard LaLonde and two unidentified 
juveniles, ages 16 and 17, are suspects in the case. The four may be arraigned 
on murder charges as early as Wednesday, Los Angeles County Undersheriff Robert 
Edmonds said. 
</P>
<P>
Although detectives have yet to establish a motive in the killing, there is "no 
indication of an occult influence," Edmonds said. He added that the four 
suspects are "acquaintances" who frequented Upland Bowl, where Jason was last 
seen alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office has yet to determine how Jason died, 
but Edmonds said there was no evidence of a gunshot wound. The body was in such 
an advanced state of decomposition that an autopsy failed to yield the cause of 
death. Results of laboratory and toxicological tests, which should shed further 
light on the mystery, are due in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs is the son of Sheriff's Sgt. Gary Hobbs of the Chino Hills substation. 
The blond youth surrendered at the Upland police station at about 7 p.m. Sunday 
under an arrangement worked out previously between his parents and sheriff's 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Kasbeck's praise of Hobbs as a "nice guy who wouldn't hurt anybody 
unless he was forced to," even he admits that his friend's life was not free of 
adolescent angst. 
</P>
<P>
There were arguments with his parents and sometimes Hobbs would leave home 
temporarily, Kasbeck said. Minor skirmishes -- like traffic tickets and a rock 
thrown through a window -- occasionally occurred with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
School was an apparent problem as well. A former Upland High School student, 
Hobbs dropped out about a year ago, friends said. Since then, he has pumped 
gas, worked at a pizza parlor and in an assortment of other odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant manager at Little Caesar's pizza parlor on Foothill Boulevard 
recalled that Hobbs "was a nice, friendly guy" but said "he goofed around a 
fair amount" and was reprimanded by the boss after a prank involving pizza 
dough. Finally, Hobbs was fired about six months ago, Richard Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
Kasbeck and others said they had noticed a change in the friends Hobbs was 
keeping in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Goshen, 16, who has lived down the block from Hobbs for about eight years, 
said the two used to go to the beach together and surf. But the outings ended 
when Hobbs began hanging out with this new group of friends. 
</P>
<P>
"These new guys were heavy metalers. That's not my style," Goshen said. 
</P>
<P>
Kasbeck, too, had seen less of Hobbs recently. "I don't trust those guys he's 
been with lately," he said. "They have this 'I don't care, it doesn't matter' 
kind of attitude. They're not like Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wayne Hobbs' friends remain stunned by the murder accusation. Kasbeck 
recalls that just two years ago, when Hobbs was a sheriff's cadet, he spent 
four days doing an anti-drug pitch at the Orange County Fair. Another time, 
Kasbeck watched his friend go to the aid of a man who was having a seizure at a 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good kid," said a neighbor, Rick Nyman, 29. "If he was involved, then 
he somehow got sucked into it and couldn't control it. But I don't think he's 
guilty."

PHONE TALKS STILL HUNG UP IN STRIKE'S 2ND DAY 
</P>

The strike against Pacific Bell in California and two other "Baby Bells" that 
supply local phone service to much of the Atlantic coast entered its second day 
Monday -- normally the week's busiest day -- with informal talks taking place 
but no signs pointing toward settlements. 
</P>
<P>
No formal negotiations between the two sides are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The automated networks continued working as usual at Pacific Bell, at NYNEX's 
phone companies in New York and New England and at Bell Atlantic, whose 
subsidiaries serve the Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
But customers still encountered aggravating delays for operator assistance, 
postponement of scheduled installations and, according to union spokesmen, 
delays of a week or more to obtain appointments for routine equipment repairs 
that normally take 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
There were also isolated incidents of shortened tempers on picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, pickets blocked vans carrying management workers 
who had been flown in from Oakland and other vehicles carrying non-union 
workers. At one point, several vehicles inched ahead until they nudged the 
blocking strikers, who responded by hammering on their hoods with picket signs. 
</P>
<P>
The most effective roadblock proved to be a picket's 150-pound Newfoundland 
dog, which dozed in a key driveway. The dog wore a sign saying: "Pac Bell's 
gone to the dogs." 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, police arrested a dozen striking workers of New England Telephone, a 
NYNEX subsidiary, for allegedly blocking the exits and driveway of a company 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Angry workers in Manhattan shouted slogans and curses in front of buildings 
used by New York Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
John Garcia, a Pacific Bell service technician on picket duty in Burbank, 
predicted that such incidents would increase if a settlement failed to come 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to turn ugly," Garcia said. "You shouldn't turn your back on your 
fellow workers." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gonzales, a picket-line monitor representing the striking Communications 
Workers of America, emphasized that violence and service disruptions are not 
union policy but added: "People are not too happy. You try to control the 
workers' fervor, but there's only so much you can do." 
</P>
<P>
The CWA represents more than 41,000 employees at Pacific Bell and another 750 
at the Reno area's Nevada Bell, the other phone company of the parent 
organization, Pacific Telesis. There, a handful of picketing CWA members vowed 
to stay off the job until contract demands are met. 
</P>
<P>
The CWA has been joined by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
in the strikes at NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, which is based in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inside phone company facilities on both coasts, management personnel 
struggled to keep up with the growing volume of calls and customer requests. 
</P>
<P>
All 17,000 of Pacific Bell's non-union personnel have strike assignments, said 
spokeswoman Lissa Zanville. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping into the front-line jobs is not necessarily an easy task for them, 
some managers are finding. A harassed operator fielding directory-assistance 
calls displayed confusion over whether a particular city's numbers were 
available on her computer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's loads of fun," she lamented. 
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the picket line militancy was a growing awareness that 
automation limits the strikers' ability to hurt their employers. At the same 
time, labor-saving technology jeopardizes many of their technical and clerical 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Beale, the CWA's chief negotiator who recently reached agreement with 
Thousand Oaks-based GTE California, the state's second-largest local phone 
company, said workers usually assess automation when they consider a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who work in the central (switching) office are more inclined to 
say, 'Don't kid yourself, the system doesn't run itself,' " Beale said. "The 
systems we have today almost operate themselves -- except that if the system 
starts to get in trouble, it's so complex that they're going to have major 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, GTE workers on Monday ratified the tentative agreement achieved 
July 9 on the eve of a strike. The new contract is retroactive to March 5 and 
will run until Dec. 17, 1992, GTE spokesman Larry Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CWA's international president, Morton Bahr, is expected to ask 
the AFL-CIO's executive council, which is holding a quarterly meeting today in 
Chicago, to urge all union members and their families to refuse to pay local 
phone bills during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The companies are still charging for key consumer services that they cannot 
deliver, like directory service and repair," said a union source. "We're saying 
that's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Major differences in all three strikes center on wages, job security and 
financing health benefits. The company is asking the workers to assume a 
greater share of skyrocketing health-care costs, a concept the union adamantly 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Labor, said any attempt to increase telephone workers' health-care 
contributions "is just another case of greed." He said unions have won improved 
health benefits only by accepting lower wage increases in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The unions had to sacrifice wage increases to support these programs," 
Robertson said. "Now, in many, cases employers try to give the appearance that 
they're providing this coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 157,000 telecommunications workers walked off their jobs over the 
weekend after contracts expired between the CWA and International Brotherhood 
of Electrical Workers and three of the seven regional Bell companies created in 
1984 to take over local phone operations from American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph. Only customers of Bell South's phone companies, serving Southeastern 
states, were spared a strike after a tentative agreement was reached minutes 
before Saturday's midnight strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts with the three remaining Baby Bells -- Ameritech in Chicago, US West 
in Denver and Southwestern Bell in St. Louis -- will expire this Saturday. 
Their phone companies provide local service throughout much of the rest of the 
United States.

IN INDIA, TIBETAN REFUGEES TELL TALES OF TORTURE AND CHINESE OPPRESSION 
</P>

<P>
The young Tibetan, an actor turned street vendor, was not surprised in the 
least when he heard about the Chinese army's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Beijing in June. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, he said, soldiers of that same army broke his right leg, 
cracked open his forehead with an electric cattle prod and beat him senseless 
every day for a month after he was caught taking part in pro-independence 
demonstrations in Tibet, which Chinese troops occupied in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"You must understand, I consider the Chinese as butchers," the 29-year-old 
Tibetan said in an interview Sunday, a few weeks after he arrived in India, a 
scarred, limping and frightened refugee. "My father and mother were butchered 
years ago as a result of Chinese repression. So, when I heard the news of Tian 
An Men Square (the June 3-4 massacre), I wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fox Needs Meat' 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are like foxes," he added. "The fox needs meat to keep himself 
alive. Similarly, the Chinese politician needs to kill to survive." 
</P>
<P>
The young Tibetan, who asked not to be named because he left his wife and 
4-year-old child behind when he fled Lhasa in May, is hardly alone, either in 
his plight or his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is among scores of increasingly militant, newly arrived Tibetan 
refugees, and his personal saga of torture and oppression in the Himalayas is a 
gnawing reminder of China's other nightmare: the nearly 40-year-old 
independence struggle of 6 million Tibetans. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the June crackdown, leaders of Tibet's opposition 
government-in-exile are trying to refocus world attention on Tibet where, they 
say, recent army repression has been at least as brutal as that in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Exaggerating 
</P>
<P>
"For the last 40 years, we have been trying to convince the outside world of 
the brutality of the Chinese authorities," said Tashi Wangdi, one of seven 
ministers in the government of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and 
his permanent representative in New Delhi. "But even those who supported our 
cause felt we were exaggerating a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he added, "it's quite clear for all to see. Recent events have exposed the 
true Chinese character to the outside world, and now people see that we really 
have been the victim of a ruthless power." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Chinese authorities consider advocacy of Tibetan independence 
to be treason. In addition, they deny that political prisoners in Tibet are 
tortured. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tibet remains under martial law, the only Chinese region outside Beijing 
where the army remains on the street. And it has endured the military presence 
longer than the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
Tibet has been under martial law for more than five months, ever since police 
opened fire on a nonviolent demonstration of Buddhist monks, nuns and 
civilians, such as the 29-year-old former actor. 
</P>
<P>
Such demonstrations have been staged periodically since the Chinese occupation, 
which in 1959 forced the Dalai Lama and tens of thousands of other Tibetans to 
flee to the northern Indian city of Dharmsala, where the religious leader set 
up his government. An estimated 80,000 Tibetans now are in exile. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the street rallies have been growing in intensity and numbers. 
They have attracted an ever-widening spectrum of Tibetan society -- men such as 
the young former actor, who was fired from his Chinese government job and had 
to turn to hawking secondhand pants and shoes on the streets after he joined 
several demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities, in turn, have intensified their response, leading to 
the formal declaration of martial law March 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Venerable Nawang Ring Ma, a 19-year-old lama from Drepung Monastery -- 
which had 7,700 monks before 1959 and now has only 300 -- said he has witnessed 
the phenomenon firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
Before fleeing for India a week after martial law was declared, the young monk 
had been jailed twice, he said -- "the first time for three months and 18 days, 
the second, for five months and 12 days." 
</P>
<P>
The most brutal incident, Ma said, occurred last year, when he was arrested 
with 50 other monks who were demonstrating at a Buddhist shrine in Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
"They handcuffed us, took us to the local police station and hung us from the 
ceiling by our hands," he recalled. "Then, they opened all the windows and 
doors and shouted to the people outside, 'You see these monks! This is what 
will happen to you if you demonstrate!' " 
</P>
<P>
Enraged at the sight of robed monks dangling in shackles, the crowd attacked 
the station and set fire to the front door, Ma recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Random Shooting 
</P>
<P>
"The police started shooting at random," he said. "With my own eyes I saw an 
elderly Tibetan carrying the dead body of a young child." 
</P>
<P>
In the coming five months, the monk recalled, he was beaten and shackled daily 
and was kept in solitary confinement. His wrists still bear the scars of the 
irons he said were kept on him. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept asking me to sign a document promising never to take part in 
demonstrations again," Ma said. "When I insisted on saying no, they hung me 
from the ceiling by my feet and beat me until I could no longer resist. I 
signed the paper." 
</P>
<P>
When they released him, he said, "a senior Chinese police officer told me, 'If 
you take part in any future demonstrations, we will burn you in front of your 
parents.' I did take part in the March demonstrations, and my parents told me 
to flee. They said, 'If you escape now, you might die trying. But, if you stay 
here, you will certainly die.' " 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the brutality that he described has led him to rethink the 
Tibetan opposition's long commitment to nonviolence, the monk said, "Yes, it is 
very difficult to challenge the Chinese with only nonviolent methods in Tibet. 
Maybe to take up arms and sacrifice one's life is needed now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commitment to Nonviolence 
</P>
<P>
Even a few years ago, such words would have been unimaginable from Tibetan 
exiles. The commitment to nonviolence is the main cornerstone of the teachings 
of the Dalai Lama. To disobey him is to challenge Tibetan Buddhism's ultimate 
religious authority.

"So far, it is the respect for His Holiness' authority that has kept people 
from pursuing a more violent approach," said Tashi Wangdi, referring to the 
Dalai Lama by his traditional title. "He has said he will abdicate (from) the 
movement if it turns violent." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "There is a very vast majority of Tibetans -- a silent majority, 
if you will -- who feel that whatever negotiations we may have with China, 
Tibetans will not gain anything out of it. And, even then, negotiations have 
not yet even begun, and these people are now beginning to say, 'We told you 
so.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wangdi also noted that Tibetans are closely watching the response of 
pro-democracy Chinese students, some of whom reportedly have turned to 
late-night sniper attacks on martial-law troops since the June crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of these factors could easily lead to a more violent threat in 
the Tibetan struggle," Wangdi said. He added that the frustration is compounded 
by the fact that Chinese authorities have not responded to the Dalai Lama's 
five-point peace proposal made during a June, 1988, speech in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wangdi added, there may yet be a bright side to the Beijing bloodbath 
for the Tibetan people. 
</P>
<P>
"For the new generation of Chinese -- especially the students -- quite a few of 
them now realize for the first time how brutal their government can be," he 
said. "We think this is very important because, in the long run, we know we 
have to deal with the Chinese, and these old leaders like Deng Xiaoping 
(China's paramount leader) cannot live forever. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what has happened in Tibet is because of a lack of knowledge. The 
Chinese people have built up a mental block. But now we see for the first time 
the door is slightly open." 
</P>
<P>
He asserted: "The Chinese people themselves are openly saying, 'If the army can 
be so brutal to our own people right here in Beijing, imagine what has been 
happening in Tibet.' "

SHEVARDNADZE SAYS IRAN SUPPORTS TALKS TO END AFGHAN CONFLICT

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Monday that Iran is showing 
a new realism in its attitude toward the Afghan conflict, and he expressed hope 
that Pakistan will join negotiations for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Afghan news agency Bakhtar that Iran, which like Pakistan has 
provided bases for thousands of Muslim rebels, has adopted a "wholly positive 
attitude" on the problem of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran is calling for broad internal Afghan dialogue, the aim of which is to 
create a representative government reflecting the whole political spectrum of 
Afghanistan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shevardnadze held talks in Tehran with Iranian President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, after which both men said their positions on Afghanistan had grown 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
The text of the interview with Bakhtar was distributed by the Soviet Foreign 
Ministry as Shevardnadze flew home from a 24-hour visit to Kabul, where he held 
talks with Afghan President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel rockets pounded Kabul again Monday, killing at least 10 people and 
wounding nearly 40. More than 40 rockets fell, some landing on a fruit market 
and others on the city's leading hotel, the Continental, briefly setting it 
ablaze but causing no casualties.

KAIFU TO BECOME NEXT PRIME MINISTER; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN'S RULING PARTY NAMES A NEW LEADER

<P>
In a shift toward youth designed to reverse its dwindling support among voters, 
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party today chose Toshiki Kaifu, 58, a former 
education minister, as the successor to outgoing Prime Minister Sosuke Uno. 
</P>
<P>
In a caucus in which 447 representatives cast effective votes, Kaifu received 
279 votes, or 62.4%, on the first ballot against two challengers to become the 
party's new president. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of the Liberal Democrats' majority in the lower house, Parliament 
will elect him prime minister on Wednesday after Uno formally resigns, assuming 
responsibility for an unprecedented upper house election defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Hayashi, 62, a former health and welfare minister who entered politics 
after a civil service career, finished second with 120 votes, while Shintaro 
Ishihara, 56, a hawkish novelist-turned-politician, got only 48. 
</P>
<P>
All three candidates agreed that the Liberal Democrats, who have ruled Japan 
since the party was formed in 1955, had lost the trust of voters and must carry 
out sweeping reforms. They also agreed that an unpopular 3% consumption tax 
that the party rammed through Parliament must be revised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Closed' Decision-Making 
</P>
<P>
Hayashi and Ishihara, however, protested what they called the "closed nature" 
of party decision-making, including factional bargaining that vaulted Kaifu 
into sudden prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Although himself tainted by a widespread influence-buying scandal, for which he 
resigned, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita single-handedly named his own 
successor, Uno, and again, this time, put his 105-member faction behind Kaifu. 
Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, Takeshita's closest ally, followed suit 
with his 80-member faction. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the Takeshita-Abe alliance in favor of his junior lieutenant, Toshio 
Komoto, 78, head of the party's tiniest faction of 30 members, last Wednesday 
agreed to step aside in favor of Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics were already dubbing Kaifu as head of "the third Takeshita 
government" -- Uno having been the second. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Uno, 66, free of any taint in the influence-buying scandal, 
proved a disastrous mistake when an ex-geisha, three days after he took office, 
accused him of a sex-for-money relationship with her in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the dark-horse contenders said they entered the race to ensure that an 
election, rather than just back-room manipulations, would be held to choose a 
new leader. Hayashi's candidacy with the backing of the 78-member faction 
headed by former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa signaled an end to the 
pan-factional, no-dissent structure of the party that has prevailed since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Front-Line Leaders Barred 
</P>
<P>
It was the first vote for a party leader since 1982 and the first election in 
the party's 34-year history in which no factional leader sought Japan's highest 
office. All of the front-line leaders have been barred from holding office 
until next May or after the next lower house election -- whichever comes first 
-- in penitence for accepting windfall profits in unlisted stocks offered them 
by Recruit Co., an information industry and real estate conglomerate that has 
been the core of the influence-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Touted as one of the party's best orators, Kaifu will be the youngest prime 
minister since 1972, when Kakuei Tanaka assumed office at 54. Only three months 
ago when he tapped Uno, Takeshita ruled out leaders in Kaifu's age group as 
"unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kaifu has had little experience in either diplomacy or economics. In 
the sub-Cabinet post of deputy chief Cabinet secretary, Kaifu attended two 
economic summits with his mentor, the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, and sat 
in on top-level U.S.-Japan meetings when Miki was in office between 1974 and 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
But only twice has he served in the Cabinet -- both times as education 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
In a campaign speech for the party post Monday, Kaifu said that he would make 
Japan's alliance with the United States the "axis" of Tokyo's diplomacy. 
Declaring that Japan "must contribute to the stability and prosperity of the 
world," he also supported an active role for Japan in foreign aid and in 
efforts to solve the problem of heavily indebted Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
In a tripartite news conference with his competitors Saturday, Kaifu displayed 
no sense of urgency about U.S.-Japan economic frictions. Japan, he said, should 
better explain to the United States the gradual improvement in the trade 
imbalance that he said is already occurring. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu will have to be reaffirmed as party leader when the term Uno inherited 
from Takeshita ends Oct. 30. Barring revelations of another scandal, however, 
the reapproval process is expected to be a formality -- unless the lower house 
election is held before then. 
</P>
<P>
That ballot is expected to be the biggest challenge the Liberal Democrats have 
ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
The upper house election defeat deprived the party of its ability to enact 
legislation unilaterally, and a loss in the lower house would strip it of the 
power to unilaterally elect its leader as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, a former college debate champion, was singled out in the hope that he 
would be able to cope with Socialist Chairwoman Takako Doi, whose oratorical 
ability and voter-appeal carried the once moribund and still ideologically bent 
Socialist Party to its biggest-ever advance in the July 23 upper house 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The lower house election must be held by next July, but it is expected much 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
A defeat in that election could bring down the Kaifu administration -- and open 
the doors again to the mainline leaders of the party.

RULING PARTY ELECTS LEADER IN NEW ZEALAND

Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer was elected leader of the ruling Labor 
Party today, placing him in line to succeed New Zealand Prime Minister David 
Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, who announced his resignation Monday, is expected to formally hand over 
the prime minister's office to Palmer later today when they meet Governor 
General Paul Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say Palmer, a 47-year-old lawyer, represents the center of 
the party, which has been hit in recent months by factional fighting. Housing 
and Health Minister Helen Clark will succeed him, making her the highest 
ranking woman in New Zealand politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so pleased the heritage of the party is locked into the people who will 
honor it," Lange told reporters after announcing Palmer's election in a party 
caucus. Asked for the voting numbers, he said, "That's a matter which I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Lange announced his resignation after his party's members in the House of 
Assembly voted to return to the Cabinet former Finance Minister Roger Douglas, 
his one-time ally but now archrival. He fired Douglas last December in a 
dispute over the pace and scope of economic reform in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, 47, who underwent a heart operation last year, also cited health as a 
reason for quitting. He said he intends to remain in the House of Assembly, or 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Lange stirred controversy when his government denied permission for 
U.S. warships to enter New Zealand ports because Washington refused to confirm 
or deny whether specific ships carried atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, before Palmer's election, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher 
said in Washington, "We are hopeful . . . that Prime Minister Lange's successor 
will reassess New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy."

BUSY HIGHWAY TO N.Y. SHUT BY FIRE DAMAGE

A garbage dump caught fire beneath Interstate 78 Monday, buckling the elevated 
roadway and causing a shutdown of the thoroughfare at one of the nation's 
busiest highway interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most serious traffic emergency in my memory," said Gov. Thomas H. 
Kean, who flew over the site. "It could not have occurred in a worse place." 
</P>
<P>
Further problems linking the busy New York area with parts of Pennsylvania 
could occur if the blaze spreads south to rubbish beneath U.S. 22, which 
parallels Interstate 78 about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"If it goes underneath Route 22, then east-west traffic could be a total loss 
from eastern Pennsylvania to New York City," state Assistant Transportation 
Commissioner Charles Edson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mountain of Debris 
</P>
<P>
The fire, fueled by a 25-foot-high, 400-yard-long mountain of construction 
debris, started about 1:30 a.m. in the heavily industrialized area not far from 
Newark International Airport. It burned all day and buckled the steel beams 
underpinning a 1,000-square-foot elevated section of the highway, officials 
said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we can get a bulldozer under there to pull that stuff out, it's going 
to have to burn itself out," said Larry Krieger, a spokesman for the Newark 
Fire Department. "It could burn until Wednesday, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke poured through cracks measuring from 5 to 8 inches wide in the highway 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said commuters knew about the fire at Hub Recycling Co. 2 miles from 
downtown Newark early enough to find alternative means of getting to and from 
work, and serious traffic problems did not develop. 
</P>
<P>
Some businesses chose to move workers out of buildings in direct line of the 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate 78 links points west to the busy New Jersey Turnpike, which leads 
into New York City and handles Interstate 95 traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Kean said he was not sure how long it would take to repair the highway.

CUSTODY OF STORED EMBRYOS DISPUTED IN DIVORCE TRIAL

<P>
In a divorce trial that began Monday, the judge must decide whether seven 
frozen embryos should go the husband, who doesn't want children now, or to the 
wife, who cannot conceive naturally. 
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit seeking a divorce from Mary Sue Davis, 28, Junior Lewis Davis, 
30, asked that she be barred from using any of the seven fertilized eggs 
without his consent. She contends she should have sole custody of the embryos 
because they represent her best chance of having a child. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of how we classify these embryos is vital," Jay Christenberry, 
Mary Sue Davis' attorney, said in his opening statement. "While the couple's 
rights are important, there are other rights we must consider." 
</P>
<P>
Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young must decide if the embryos deserve 
consideration as potential children and should be treated as such, or if they 
are property for the purposes of the divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The case is thought to be the first of its type in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A medical ethics expert testified Monday that the embryos deserve special 
respect, but should not be regarded as having the same rights as living 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Robertson, a law professor at the University of Texas, said there is 
broad consensus that "the pre-embryo at this stage is not a legal subject." 
</P>
<P>
"Because it represents potential life, it deserves a special respect above that 
accorded any other human tissue, but not the respect of a person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he helped to draft the ethical guidelines the American Fertility 
Society follows in the technology. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson described the embryos -- eggs removed from Mary Sue Davis and 
fertilized with Junior Davis' sperm in a laboratory procedure, then frozen and 
stored late last year -- as "undifferentiated cells." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not even clear that you have a unique individual at this stage. There is 
no clearly defined biological individual," he told the court. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson testified that the case should be decided in favor of the one who 
would be hurt most by losing, Junior Davis. He said Mary Sue Davis can try in 
vitro fertilization again if she loses, and that would be less of a burden on 
her than unwanted fatherhood would be for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Christenberry said the embryos are "pre-born" 
children with rights of their own. A central question in the case is "where 
life begins," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that fertilization "might be a first step," but that there are 
several other, equally vital steps in the process of bearing a child. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier testimony indicated that the embryos, which are stored at minus 180 
degrees Centigrade in a Knoxville hospital, have developed no more than eight 
cells each.

ECONOMIC GAP BETWEEN RACES PUT AT 150 YEARS

Black Americans are progressing so slowly in economic terms that there appears 
to be little chance of their catching up with whites before the middle of the 
22nd Century, the National Urban League said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects are slightly better for blacks in matters of education and health, a 
study conducted by the league found, but in some areas, such as infant 
mortality, the researchers were unable to estimate when equality between the 
races might be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The league's annual conference has attracted 16,000 people to Washington for 
three days of lectures, workshops, career counseling and other activities. The 
report, titled "Stalling Out: The Relative Progress of African Americans," 
seemed to belie the theme of the meeting, "Parity by the Year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
"The impressive, long-term progress of African Americans has in more recent 
years stalled and, in some cases, even reversed," the league said in a 
statement released with the report. 
</P>
<P>
The projections were drawn from Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau 
findings, the Urban League researchers said. Another recent publication, "The 
State of Black America 1989," cited the same data to show that blacks are three 
times as likely as whites to be poor and twice as likely as whites to be 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our report plots the numbers over the period from 1970 to 1985, and makes 
predictions from changes in the past rate of growth," said Betty Watson, an 
Urban League economist. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban League study found that it would take more than 1,000 years for home 
ownership among blacks to catch up with the rate among whites. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of blacks who finish high school, however, increased from 55% of 
the white graduation rate in 1967 to 79% in 1985.

CITY OKS RESTORATION OF BELMONT ROLLER COASTER

Acting to preserve a historic landmark and revive family-oriented entertainment 
in Mission Beach, the San Diego City Council on Monday authorized a 
$1.2-million restoration of the 64-year-old Giant Dipper roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to allow the same Santa Cruz firm that will restore the 
Belmont Park coaster to build an adjacent carrousel, which, the company said, 
will attract families with small children and make the entire amusement project 
financially possible.

The 8-0 vote, with Councilman Wes Pratt absent, vindicated the Save the Coaster 
Committee, which rescued the coaster from demolition in 1981 and during the 
past eight years has raised more than $1 million in cash and free services for 
a timber-by-timber rehabilitation of its wooden framework. 
</P>
<P>
Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, the ride is one of only 18 
wooden roller coasters left in the United States, which boasted 1,200 in the 
1920s and '30s, the heyday of coaster construction. 
</P>
<P>
"This has never been done," said Donald J. Reeves, the architect who oversaw 
the coaster reconstruction. "We've never saved one. We've lost hundreds in this 
country in the last 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overriding Considerations 
</P>
<P>
To approve the reconstruction, the council had to find that overriding 
considerations justified reopening the attraction, despite proof that it would 
increase noise, traffic and parking hassles in a neighborhood already 
overburdened by those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the action, the council granted the coaster an amendment from the 
city noise ordinance. Noise in the area where the coaster will be built already 
exceeds city standards for residential zones, at an average of 70 to 73 
decibels, because of jet and auto traffic. Operation of the coaster will raise 
noise to an average of 74 to 77 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise level already is excessive with aircraft, motorboats, water-skiers 
and shouts of joy," said one Mission Beach resident on the losing side of the 
debate. Another protested that most homeowners have moved in since the coaster 
stopped operating in 1977, "never dreaming of an amendment to the city noise 
ordinance" and its impact on property values. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to virtual traffic gridlock and a perennial parking problem during 
peak beach season, Mission Beach in recent years has battled a perceived 
increase in noise and public disorderliness that has caused homeowners to 
repeatedly demand action from City Hall, including the nighttime closure of 
some parking lots in South Mission Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia Won Out 
</P>
<P>
But, on a warm August evening that marked the penultimate council meeting 
before summer recess, nostalgia overwhelmed such complaints and cold, hard 
statistics. Councilman Bruce Henderson, who represents Mission Beach, 
proclaimed that "the right to ride on the coaster is the birthright of every 
San Diego child." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor also shared childhood memories of the coaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a native San Diegan. I also rode the roller coaster," she said. "I did not 
have fond memories of the roller coaster. I was scared to death, and I never 
want to ride the roller coaster again." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the attraction for council members and City Manager John Lockwood is 
that the restoration will not cost the city a dime; neither have Save the 
Coaster Committee activists asked for city money thus far. 
</P>
<P>
The city's agreement with San Diego Seaside Co. -- a group of principals from 
firms that manufacture vehicles, brakes and other components for wooden roller 
coasters -- calls for the company to spend $1.2 million restoring the coaster's 
track and moving parts. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which owns the land west of Mission Boulevard and south of Ventura 
Place where the coaster and carrousel will be, will take ownership of the 
coaster from the Save the Coaster Committee on Monday in exchange for 479 
lifetime passes to ride it. Coaster advocates used the lifetime pass guarantee 
as a fund-raising gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Open Next Spring 
</P>
<P>
The city agreed to lease the coaster to San Diego Seaside for 31 years, 
granting a rent credit equal to the $1.2-million restoration price. After that 
is paid, the city will collect 5% of all gross income from the coaster's 
operation, or $24,000 a year, whichever is greater. San Diego Seaside will also 
build a small coaster museum. 
</P>
<P>
If reconstruction goes according to schedule, the coaster will open next 
spring, offering rides from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on summer weekends, with shorter 
hours in other seasons and during the week, said Dana Morgan of San Diego 
Seaside. Prices will range from $1 in winter to as much as $2 in summer, with 
special discounts offered. 
</P>
<P>
The carrousel, also being constructed by San Diego Seaside, will be an 
"elaborate reproduction" of a 1910 ride that will "recapture some of the 
original flavor of Belmont Park," which was opened to development in 1986. 
Belmont Park Associates built a shopping mall there, despite strong opposition 
to the plan from some Mission Beach residents. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Park Associates plans to sublease the carrousel site to San Diego 
Seaside.

VICTIM'S KIN NOT ALLOWED TO CLAIM BODY;

REQUIREMENT FOR PARENTAL PERMISSION UPSETS RELATIVES

<P>
A day after Juan Pedro Trujillo was gunned down on the Santa Ana Freeway at the 
wheel of his truck, his relatives said Monday that they are frustrated by the 
coroner's refusal to allow them to view the body or to bury Trujillo without 
permission from his parents, who live in a remote village in central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Family members, who say they have no explanation of the random violence that 
claimed Trujillo's life, are eager to get on with the business of burying the 
22-year-old Anaheim man who had dreams of becoming a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of spending their time grieving, the family has become frustrated 
and increasingly bitter by the confusing bureaucracy involved in the criminal 
investigation into Trujillo's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rounds From Assault Rifle 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo died early Sunday at UCI Medical Center in Orange after someone in a 
car fired several rounds from a semiautomatic assault rifle at his truck. 
Trujillo, his brother and a cousin were returning home from a restaurant about 
3:45 a.m. when the incident occurred neared the northbound Chapman Avenue exit 
in Orange. The two passengers in the truck were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Despite dozens of tips, police said they had no leads and were continuing to 
look for a blue Oldsmobile Cutlass they believe was involved in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Since Trujillo's death, the family has been unable to view the body or find out 
when they will be able to retrieve it for burial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Coroner's Standards' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a right to see him, at least his brothers and sisters," said 
Juan Zaragoza, who is married to Trujillo's sister Carmen. "Imagine what they 
are suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Stanzak, a coroner's office supervisor, said the body would be released 
only to the next of kin, in this case Trujillo's parents, who are in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"This is coroner's standards," he said. "They can fax in a release or have it 
telegrammed. We will not release the body to his brother and sisters. They are 
not next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not unusual," Stanzak said. "We handle cases like this all the time. 
The parents don't have to travel. All we ask for is a letter to release the 
body. I'm sure there's a way for a letter or a telegram to get through." 
</P>
<P>
But family members, who do not speak English, said the matter is not so simple. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo's parents live in the tiny village of El Juamuhil in the central 
Mexican state of Jalisco, which is little more than a collection of farms 
without the most basic public services. There are no paved roads or telephones, 
much less a fax machine or telegraph service. 
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza said the family called cousins in the nearby town of La Barca Jalisco, 
where there is telegraph service, but that they would have to travel across 
dirt roads to get to the village. That may be difficult because this is the 
rainy season in that part of the country and the roads are virtually 
impassable, Zaragoza said. 
</P>
<P>
"My cousin said they would try to somehow get a tractor to see if they could go 
and notify Juan Pedro's parents about his death," Zaragoza said. "His parents 
are old now, and I don't think they can come. Imagine the blow this is going to 
be for them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Sent Home 
</P>
<P>
Family members said Trujillo's parents live off the money their children send 
back from their jobs in Orange County. Trujillo had worked at Big O Tires in 
Santa Ana and lived with his sister and her family in Anaheim. He was single 
and had no children. 
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting on Sunday, Zaragoza went to UCI Medical Center where his 
brother-in-law had been taken and pronounced dead. Zaragoza then returned home 
to break the news to the family. But when they returned to the hospital, they 
were told that Trujillo's body had been taken to the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did they move body from the hospital to the coroner's without telling us?" 
Zaragoza said. "He is not like a rock that can be moved from place to place 
with no one interested in what happens to it." 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly do not understand why they do that," he said. "The least they could 
have done was to let us know. They had our telephone number. . . . I just don't 
think that this is right." 
</P>
<P>
Once at the coroner's office, they found it locked. When they knocked, no one 
answered. Frustrated, they asked an officer in a nearby police car for help. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer called from his car, and got someone to open the door for us," 
Zaragoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza said the man who answered the door identified himself as William King, 
supervising investigator in the coroner's office, but he told them they could 
not view the body. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Had to Run Tests' 
</P>
<P>
"They would not let us in, they only spoke to us at the doorway," Zaragoza 
said. "They said he was there but we couldn't see him until Tuesday afternoon, 
or Wednesday, because they had to run a lot of tests." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Scott Stanton, a city of Orange police watch commander, said that he 
sympathized with the family but that it is the job of the coroner's office to 
notify the family about the body being transferred and to make the decision 
when the body can be released. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand" the family's frustration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza said the experience had been a difficult one for the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We are people who have to work for a living," he said. "We don't have time or 
money to move around from place to place looking for our relative. We are 
trying to take care of this as cheaply as possible, because we are poor people, 
but it seems a bit hard for us that this sheriff's office tells us we cannot 
have our brother."

Striking phone workers set up picket lines outside many of Pacific Bell's 53 
Orange County facilities Monday as a strike by the Communication Workers of 
America union on both coasts entered its first business day with no sign of 
progress toward settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it takes, we're ready to stay out here," said Mary Balis, an 
operator who had gathered with fellow workers outside a Pacific Bell building 
on Euclid Street in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Cross Picket Lines 
</P>
<P>
A union official said that up to 2,000 striking operators, technicians and 
other workers showed up to picket and that fewer than 100 people crossed picket 
lines. A spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, which serves 731,000 customers in Orange 
County, said that only a handful of union operators showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
Sign-waving strikers in Orange County reported peaceful protests Monday. 
Company and union officials monitoring the picket lines said there was 
scattered heckling between pickets and people crossing their lines. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, there were reports of minor picket-line violence 
among the 157,000 phone workers who walked out over the weekend. A dozen 
striking workers were arrested in Boston Monday and some scuffling was reported 
at a Pacific Bell billing office and switching center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is against three so-called "Baby Bell" companies that supply local 
phone service along much of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The automated 
networks continued working as usual at Pacific Bell, at NYNEX's phone companies 
in New York and New England and at Bell Atlantic, whose subsidiaries serve the 
Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays of Up to 5 Minutes 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the strike, which has idled nearly 5,000 workers, slowed 
directory assistance, operator help and other telephone services. Delays of up 
to five minutes were reported on 411 calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Service is not what customers would expect on a day-to-day basis," said Linda 
Bonniksen, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike goes on, Orange County customers can expect little or no effect 
on direct-dial calls but delays in operator service, directory assistance and 
repair requests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers are postponing calling in for new service," Bonniksen said. "They're 
pretty much realizing our limitations." 
</P>
<P>
The company's 955 managers in Orange County have been trained to replace 
striking workers, Bonniksen said, and 350 other managers from the company's 
Oakland headquarters arrived Monday to pitch in as operators, maintenance 
personnel and coin collectors. All are scheduled to work 12-hour shifts, six 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are wages and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said they would like to see the company pay a larger share of 
recent increases in health insurance costs and reduce the compensation gap 
between the highest-paying jobs, dominated by men, and the lowest-paying jobs 
-- such as operators -- most of which are held by women. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Durbin, executive vice president of Local 9510, said that worker 
productivity has gone up but that the company's "retrogressive" offer of a 
10.93% pay raise over the next three years won't match cost-of-living 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a lot of real money," Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell spokeswoman Bonniksen said Monday that the strike could have been avoided 
if the union had weighed more carefully what the company described as a 
"generous" contract offer that includes increased medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's offices in Tustin Monday, an emergency operations center 
normally reserved for disasters such as earthquakes handled calls from other 
offices needing help to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
In an emergency, the room has enough food for three months and comes complete 
with cots and ham radios. But on Monday, it took on a quieter pace, as 
supervisors calmly made sure operations wouldn't crumble as just 20% of all 
positions were filled by managers, said Gary Cuccio, Orange County's customer 
services general manager for Pacific Bell. (With managers working 72-hour 
weeks, 40% of total manpower needs are being covered, Cuccio said.) 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio, who traded his desk for a climb on Newport Beach telephone polls 
Monday, said customers can expect repairs to take a day and installation from 
three to five days. They were advised to save time by looking up numbers and 
avoid making collect calls, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, some newly christened operators wore name tags to get acquainted with 
fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Managers who learned the job in one day rather than the usual seven said their 
new jobs give them an opportunity to learn more about the business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been interesting -- a side of the business I haven't worked on," said 
operator Arlene Steinert. "We're all very cautious, though." 
</P>
<P>
Out on the street in front of Pacific Bell's Garden Grove facility, things were 
a little noisier. 
</P>
<P>
During the morning rush hour, many motorists honked and raised their fists in 
support of the striking workers who paraded in front of the building waving 
their signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be out here; we'd just as soon be in there," striker Balis 
said. "We'd just like to get a piece of the pie we helped create." 
</P>
<P>
Operator Larry Cain, a single father with two children, said he cannot afford 
to carry on without an additional increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I at least want to stay even with the cost of living," he said, taking a break 
from picketing. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, a three-year employee, said pickets are dedicated and intend to stay out 
on strike as long as possible. Referring to his children, Cain said: "Whatever 
I give here is going to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Wyscarver, who doesn't work for the phone company but is a friend of a 
striking worker, joined her in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supporting a local cause," said Wyscarver, lounging on a beach chair next 
to a clump of empty soda cans and signs that read, "Their profits are off the 
chart. Now, it's our turn." 
</P>
<P>
"If they lose, we all lose."

RICKEY ROSS WON'T APPEAL HIS FIRING AS SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rickey Ross, the fired Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics investigator 
accused of slaying three prostitutes only to have the murder charges dropped, 
will not appeal his dismissal from the department, the county Civil Service 
Commission disclosed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' attorney, Howard L. Weitzman, said an agreement had been reached with the 
Sheriff's Department under which Ross was allowed to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The Ross case caused a sensation when he was arrested last February in 
South-Central Los Angeles, while sitting in a car with a prostitute. Police 
initially linked Ross to a series of prostitute murders through the results of 
ballistics tests that were performed on his handgun -- results that later 
proved to be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' decision not to appeal his dismissal was contained in a one-sentence 
letter to the commission, dated last Friday. It came just before he was to go 
before a county hearing officer today in what was expected to be a dramatic 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the commission received by messenger a letter from the 18-year 
Sheriff's Department veteran, declaring: "I hereby withdraw my appeal from 
before the Civil Service Commission and request that you either seal my file or 
return all materials in it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Undersheriff Robert A. Edmonds said, Ross resigned from the 
department "for personal reasons." The resignation -- effective April 27 -- was 
the same day that Sheriff Sherman Block had sent the deputy a formal 
termination letter. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 40, declined to comment when reached at his Rialto home. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman said that Ross was emotionally drained by his incarceration for 81 
days in county jail and the attendant publicity. The attorney said Ross decided 
he could not resume his old job, even if he won reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's emotionally incapable of going back to law enforcement work," Weitzman 
said in a telephone interview. The lawyer said that Ross, given "the trauma 
he's gone through and the anguish he's suffered," did not think he could remain 
a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
But Weitzman said he is preparing a lawsuit designed "to allow Rickey to 
recover damages of unlawful arrest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Unmarked County Car 
</P>
<P>
Ross' problems began in the early morning hours of Feb. 23, when two Los 
Angeles police officers found him sitting in an unmarked county car on Flower 
Street, between 57th and 58th streets, with a prostitute, Jimmie Joann McGhee, 
21, of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Block, in his termination letter to Ross, said the deputy had "brought 
discredit and embarrassment to yourself and the Department" when he was 
allegedly found smoking crack cocaine with the prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
"She said that you provided a small piece of cocaine and at the time the 
officers approached your vehicle, you and she were smoking cocaine together," 
Block wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' arrest had been announced at a news conference conducted by Block and Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates after the Police Department's forensics 
tests purportedly linked Ross's handgun to the three slayings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
But then, in a remarkable turnabout, a county prosecutor announced last May 15 
that the murder charges would have to be dismissed because the results of the 
ballistics tests were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee, currently in County Jail on a prostitution charge, was scheduled to be 
the first witness today at Ross's hearing.

BALLOT PROPOSALS THAT CITY IGNORED RETURN TO HAUNT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening the door to a possible delay of next month's San Diego City Council 
races, a federal judge Monday issued a ruling that clears the way for the 
Chicano Federation to seek a postponement of the city's first-ever 
district-only election. 
</P>
<P>
Saying it appears that "the city made a promise . . . and didn't keep it" with 
regard to placing proposed election changes on this November's ballot, U. S. 
District Judge John S. Rhoades agreed to permit the Chicano Federation to 
broaden its 20-month-old lawsuit aimed at altering the city's electoral system. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on those amendments to the lawsuit has been scheduled for Aug. 28, 
when Rhoades will decide whether he has the authority to order the city to 
place the election changes sought by the Chicano Federation on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge sides with the Chicano Federation on that legal question, the 
group will probably then ask that the Sept. 19 council election be postponed 
until June, 1990, on the grounds that the election system now in place is 
unconstitutional. Rhoades also pointedly told the city's attorneys that, even 
if he allows the race to proceed, he could later declare it invalid and order a 
new election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Itself to Blame' 
</P>
<P>
"If the judge does push back the election to next June, the City Council has 
only itself to blame," Chicano Federation Chairman Jess Haro said after 
Monday's two-hour hearing, adding that his group prefers that timetable. "The 
city could have taken care of these problems much earlier. But it didn't, and 
that's why it's in this position." 
</P>
<P>
Filed in January, 1988, the Chicano Federation lawsuit contended that the 
two-tiered council election system then in place -- district primaries, 
followed by citywide runoffs between the two top vote-getters in each district 
-- unconstitutionally diluted the impact of Latino votes. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego voters' narrow approval of a district-only election initiative in 
November accomplished one of the suit's major objectives by eliminating the 
at-large runoffs, which many political activists argued minimized minority 
candidates' chances of being elected. 
</P>
<P>
While the city's lawyers argue that the impending switch to district-only 
council elections essentially renders the lawsuit moot, Chicano Federation 
attorney Patricia Meyer stressed to Rhoades on Monday that the suit seeks 
additional remedies designed to enhance minority political clout. In 
particular, the group favors expansion of the number of council seats and the 
creation of an independent board to draw district lines, a politically 
sensitive job now handled by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of a district system solved only part of the problem," Meyer 
said. "By itself, it doesn't rectify the system's inequities."

Reneged on Agreement? 
</P>
<P>
A key point of contention in Monday's hearing was whether the city reneged on 
an agreement aimed at settling the questions raised in the Chicano Federation 
lawsuit at the ballot box rather than in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting last year with Magistrate Harry McCue, Mayor Maureen O'Connor 
and retired Justice Ed Butler, then chairman of the city's Charter Review 
Commission, pledged that any election changes proposed by the panel would be 
placed on the 1989 ballot, according to Meyer. That pledge was little more that 
a reiteration of an April, 1988, council resolution promising that "all 
recommendations made by the commission shall be placed directly on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Combined with the district-election initiative, that approach held out the 
possibility that voters might approve the changes sought by the Chicano 
Federation, precluding the need for a lengthy, costly lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that agreement, McCue put the case on hold until after last November's 
vote on Proposition E, the district-election measure. 
</P>
<P>
However, in June, the council, contrary to its earlier resolution, refused to 
place the review panel's proposed charter changes, which included an expansion 
of the council from eight to 10 seats and an impartial redistricting board, on 
the ballot. In so doing, Meyer argued, the city voided the agreement on which 
the lawsuit had been stayed, forcing the issue back into court. 
</P>
<P>
In response, John McDermott, an attorney hired by the city to defend it in the 
lawsuit, offered a two-pronged argument. The 1988 council resolution pledging 
to forward the proposed charter changes to voters was "totally independent of 
this case," McDermott said. Furthermore, McDermott claimed that it was McCue's 
"own idea" to stay the case; the decision was not directly based, he said, on 
any promises made by O'Connor and Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council resolution specifically stated that the panel's 
recommendations "shall" be placed on the ballot, McDermott said the city 
interpreted that to mean that any such proposals "would come back to the 
council for a ministerial decision." Adding yet another wrinkle to his defense, 
McDermott also characterized the resolution as simply a legislative act that 
could be altered through later action, not a legally binding contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Keep' Promise 
</P>
<P>
Clearly unpersuaded, Rhoades told McDermott that, after carefully reading the 
council resolution, "I can't even get close to what you're saying." 
</P>
<P>
"Shall means shall, not will or maybe or might," Rhoades said. "I have a very 
hard time accepting your explanation, Mr. McDermott. The city made a promise to 
someone and didn't keep it." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Rhoades' ruling, the lawsuit's plaintiffs will be expanded to 
add blacks to Latinos as the primary groups allegedly harmed by the city's 
election system. The judge's decision also permits Meyer to raise additional 
legal arguments -- notably, the contention that, even under a strictly district 
system, San Diego's electoral process violates the one-man, one-vote principle. 
</P>
<P>
Because of population disparities among the eight districts, votes in larger 
districts are, statistically, if not politically, worth less than votes in 
smaller districts, Meyer argued. The 4th and 8th council districts, which have 
the highest concentrations of minority voters in the city, also are among the 
most populous districts, exacerbating that problem, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, permitting next month's elections in four council districts to 
proceed would result in the victors being selected through a legally flawed 
system, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city acknowledges that, because of growth and other factors, some 
districts are numerically larger than others, it argues that the differences 
are within federal standards -- a contention that Meyer disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"Are the districts . . . imbalanced? You bet," McDermott said. "Is that a 
reason for (postponing) an election that is weeks away? No." 
</P>
<P>
The final answer to that question, however, will be made by Rhoades later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Dismay to I Told You So 
</P>
<P>
At City Hall, Rhoades' ruling drew predominantly negative reactions among 
council members, with most expressing doubt that the judge will, in fact, 
produce the worst-case scenario by halting next month's election. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ed Struiksma, for example, argued that an eleventh-hour postponement 
would be unfair to the candidates in the four odd-numbered districts at stake 
in next month's primary. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that candidates already have made significant investments of time and 
money in their campaigns, Struiksma said: "It would be virtually impossible to 
stop the political process at its current juncture." 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating a point made by the city's lawyers, Councilwoman Gloria McColl 
pointed out that, because elections are scheduled to be held in only half of 
the council districts this fall, the city would have to spend up to $500,000 
more to hold a citywide race if Rhoades orders the Chicano Federation's 
preferred electoral changes on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"If the judge would like to come up with the money to put it on the ballot, I'd 
be happy to reconsider it," McColl said. "We're trying to build courts and 
jails. If that judge thinks a special election is more important than courts 
and jails, I want to hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor O'Connor, meanwhile, displayed an I-told-you-so attitude about the 
potential legal-electoral quandary now facing the city, noting that she was one 
of only three council members to vote to place the Charter Review Commission's 
recommendations on the ballot.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRABUCO CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
DISCUSSION DELAYED ON TRABUCO CANYON PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A meeting to announce the county's recommendation for development of 6,300 
acres in the Trabuco Canyon area east of Mission Viejo has been postponed until 
Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
County officials had planned to meet with area residents at the Trabuco Canyon 
fire station Wednesday to discuss their preference for growth in the rugged and 
undeveloped area that sits on the edge of Cleveland National Forest. But delays 
in firming up that recommendation forced a one-week postponement, said Lynn 
Dosherry, chief of the county's land-planning section. 
</P>
<P>
There are 30 development projects in varying stages of planning and approval 
that could result in 4,833 new housing units being built in the 
Foothill-Trabuco area. Four options for growth are under consideration by 
county planners, who indicate that their recommendation may be a hybrid of the 
various alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and environmentalists contend that only a limited number of new, 
single-family homes on large lots should be allowed to minimize the impact on 
the life style of about 300 homeowners in the area ,as well as on the wildlife 
and several thousand oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors ultimately must adopt a Foothill-Trabuco Specific 
Plan, an action that is not likely until late September.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: U.S. AGENCY TO PROBE MYSTERY CAT 
DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal agency will investigate whether dozens of county cats were killed and 
mutilated over the last few months by people instead of coyotes, as county 
officials recently concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The Animal Damage Control Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture will 
reportedly send a representative from Sacramento as soon as possible to look 
into the killings, which have all occurred in North Tustin and nearby 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
County animal control officials had been investigating the killings for months 
and blamed coyotes searching for food. 
</P>
<P>
But North Tustin cat owner Janet Hampson, who has been conducting her own 
investigation, contends that the killings have come at the hands of people. She 
said someone with a knife has been cutting up the animal body parts and 
collecting the blood, perhaps to use in some kind of satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson received permission from animal control to bring some of the cats from 
recent killings to private veterinarians, who concluded that not all deaths 
were due to coyotes or other predators. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian K.G. Kali said that three of the 20 cats he examined over the past 
three weeks appeared to have been killed by people. Necropsies on the other 
cats were inconclusive because their bodies were too mutilated, Kali said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuts on the bodies of the three cats were clean, indicating that they had been 
caused by an object such as a knife, hatchet or ax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were no signs of bite marks or trauma to indicate that an animal 
had killed the cat or that it had been hit by a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen where they are cleanly cut like these three are," Kali said. 
"They were very cleanly cut."

COPTER PLUCKS NAVY CLIMBER FROM CLIFF IN DARING RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Navy commando who fell off a Mission Trails County Park cliff Monday to a 
rock embankment 25 feet below was rescued by San Diego Fire Department and 
Sheriff's Department crews, who scaled the cliff and maneuvered a helicopter 
dangerously close to the outcropping to get to the injured climber. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old member of the Navy Sea, Air and Land tactical team, whom 
authorities would not identify, suffered a concussion, broken ribs and a pelvic 
injury. He was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in good 
condition late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As many as a dozen members of the Navy SEAL team were drilling and had been 
free-scaling a 200-foot sheer face of the cliff, above Father Junipero Serra 
Trail, without safety ropes Monday afternoon when the man lost his footing and 
fell, said Rick Foehr, a supervisor with Hartson Ambulance Service in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews climbed up steep, winding trails to reach the man, who had fallen 
onto a large rock embankment jutting from the cliff, and found him conscious. 
</P>
<P>
But the crews, fearing the steep trails, called for the Sheriff's Department 
helicopter to transport him out, Foehr said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Bill Hubbard maneuvered close enough to rest one skid of the helicopter 
on the embankment, and rescue crews moved the man inside the copter. 
</P>
<P>
"It went real smooth. It was real good teamwork between all the agencies 
involved," Foehr said. "It looks like we definitely saved a life."

CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD WANTS TO EXPAND DRUG INTERDICTION EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California National Guard hopes to expand its drug interdiction efforts in 
the wake of the Border Ranger II operation last May on the U. S.-Mexico border, 
the Guard's top officer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Adjutant Gen. Robert Thrasher called the monthlong operation, which deployed 
405 reservists at legal and illegal border crossings and in the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach, "a model" for military efforts against drug smuggling 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that the Guard's combat readiness would suffer if the force 
were continually diverted to drug interdiction tasks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Publicized Crackdown 
</P>
<P>
At a Mission Valley seminar hosted by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) and 
attended by local law enforcement officials, National Guard officers provided 
fresh details of the controversial operation that placed their troops, some of 
them armed, on the border. The mission involved surveillance and customs 
searches by the soldiers, who then passed on the information to civilian 
agencies for further action. 
</P>
<P>
The much-publicized crackdown netted more than four tons of drugs with an 
estimated street value of $135 million, said Maj. James Hitsley, who worked on 
Border Ranger II as an intelligence and operations officer. Guardsmen searched 
13,432 vehicles and 828 shipping containers, and their work led to 569 arrests, 
Hitsley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Guard also conducted ground and air surveillance of the border area, he 
said. It used ground-based radar at Laguna Salada in the desert and AH-64 
Apache helicopters equipped with infrared sensors for the May operation, and 
the military technology proved a notable success, Hitsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Although they lacked arrest powers, some of the National Guard units deployed 
in Border Ranger II were the first in the nation to be armed with assault 
rifles for a drug interdiction mission. Hunter, an advocate of military 
involvement in such missions, said armed guardsmen worked only as border 
observers and carried weapons for self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter also said he favors giving the military arrest powers and dismissed 
concerns that the proposal would endanger civil rights. "The only thing it 
would endanger are the drug traffickers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hunter, along with Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who backed legislation 
in 1988 that eventually appropriated $300 million for this year's military drug 
interdiction efforts. Of that amount, $40 million went to the National Guard, 
including $2 million for operation Border Ranger II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Operation Canceled 
</P>
<P>
Although that money has nearly run out, the Guard could get as much as $70 
million for similar operations in 1990, according to Thrasher. Total 
appropriations for next year's military drug interdiction could rise to $450 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Border Ranger operation, a predecessor of the May effort, was canceled 
after one of its first helicopter patrols crashed, killing five sheriffs' 
deputies from different parts of Southern California and three guardsmen 
aboard. Despite claims of Border Ranger II's success, National Guard officers 
at the seminar acknowledged that they could not gauge the effect of the 
operation on the overall flow of illegal drugs into the country. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. William Braniff and San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen attended the 
seminar. Representatives from the FBI and the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Border Patrol and Customs Service were also there. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hunter's constituents, invited because of their concern about drug 
trafficking, repeatedly questioned the officials about potential solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"What would Harry Truman have done about all this?" asked one man. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sell or promote drugs, the first time you are caught (the sentence) 
should be 30 years in prison, and the second time the death penalty," said 
another, to scattered applause.

PILOT FLYING TOO SLOWLY, FRIEND SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
FISH-SPOTTING PLANE APPEARED TO STALL, THEN PLUNGED IN SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The missing pilot of a light plane that crashed into the ocean off Dana Point 
probably lost control of the craft when he spotted a swordfish and slowed to 
track its movement for a fishing boat, a close friend said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph A. Shirley had been flying for about an hour Sunday morning when his 
single-engine plane appeared to stall in midair, then plunged several hundred 
feet into the Pacific about 10 miles southwest of Dana Point, said Dick 
McDowell, a longtime friend of the 42-year-old pilot and building contractor 
from Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Based on reports from eyewitnesses, McDowell speculated that Shirley was so 
intent on keeping track of a fish he had located that he purposely slowed the 
plane's engine to a near idle. But when the craft began to dive, Shirley was 
unable to regain enough speed to avoid crashing at about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Experienced Spotter' 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is an experienced fish spotter, but it has been a slow summer," said 
McDowell, owner of an aviation charter business at an El Cajon airport east of 
San Diego where Shirley kept his plane. "My guess is, he got so excited about 
finally spotting a swordfish, he did everything he could not to lose that 
fish." 
</P>
<P>
Added McDowell, who also spots fish for commercial boats: "Joe was a good, very 
good pilot. This is sad." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities called off the search for Shirley's Cessna 172 late Sunday because 
rescuers found only minor debris from the plane's cabin -- paper cups, a can of 
wax, a tennis shoe and an aerosol can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Lasted 10 Hours 
</P>
<P>
A pair of U.S. Coast Guard cutters as well as two U.S. Navy vessels spent 
nearly 10 hours Sunday covering a 77-square-mile area in near-perfect weather, 
Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall said. Visibility at the time of the crash 
and most of Sunday afternoon was 15 to 20 miles with light winds and only 
two-foot swells. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything they found fit into one small box," Hall said. "The plane 
apparently sank like a rock." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean depths reach 2,400 feet near the crash site, making it extremely 
difficult to retrieve the plane, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, investigators with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board 
are looking into the incident. Because no engine nor other parts of the plane 
were found, the agency's review will rely on eyewitness accounts of the crash, 
as well as interviews with Shirley's family and friends and an examination of 
the plane's maintenance records. Shirley's medical history will also be 
explored to determine if he had heart disease or other ailments that may have 
contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"For all we know, he could have had a heart attack. We just don't know," said 
Gary Mucho, the investigator in charge of the NTSB's Los Angeles office. "This 
is a tough one because we have no wreckage to examine. We may never know what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flying Too Low and Slow 
</P>
<P>
The pilot's brother also speculated that Shirley may have been flying too low 
and too slow, causing the engine to stall. When the plane hit the water, the 
pilot may have been knocked unconscious, said John Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
"He just was not as astute as he could have been," said John Shirley, who owns 
a Del Mar hot-air balloon company. "Aviation is very unforgiving. It's not like 
a walk in the park." 
</P>
<P>
John Shirley does not believe that his brother's body will ever be recovered. 
"I just wish he wasn't dead," he said. "It was too sudden, too permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley, a bachelor, was described by McDowell as an "experienced pilot" with 
more than 2,000 flying hours. In the late 1970s, McDowell sold Shirley his 
first plane. About three months ago, Shirley bought the Cessna he was flying 
Sunday. It is not considered a high-performance plane and is capable of top 
speeds of little more than 115 miles per hour. But the aircraft is well-suited 
to the slow, often tedious flying required to spot swordfish for commercial 
fishing boats. The swordfish like to sun themselves in the warmer waters near 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Though Shirley's new plane was built in 1967, McDowell said it was in 
"excellent condition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enough Fuel for 4 Hours 
</P>
<P>
A contractor specializing in custom homes, Shirley kept his plane at Gillespie 
Field, a general aviation airport in El Cajon where more than 700 planes are 
parked. McDowell said Shirley took off about 10:30 a.m. Sunday with enough fuel 
to stay airborne nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
As he did often in the past, Shirley agreed to spend several hours helping to 
spot swordfish for a friend who skippers a commercial fishing boat out of San 
Diego, McDowell said. The boat, the Horizon, was operating over the weekend 
from Dana Point Harbor. McDowell said Shirley was not working for pay. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell said: "He just loves to fly, and he liked to go up and spot fish 
because of the challenge. He knew the risks, but he was an adventurer." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Shirley is survived by his brother, a sister and his mother, who lives 
in Newport Beach.

A LITTLE TASTE OF THE TROPICS STARTS SOUTHLAND'S WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it seemed to you like uncommonly nice weather around here on Monday, you 
were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
According to the people who study such things, those balmy temperatures and 
relatively blue skies are pretty typical in the Los Angeles area at this time 
of year. 
</P>
<P>
Take the high temperature at the Civic Center on Monday -- 84 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Weather Service, that's the normal high for the date. 
Monday's overnight low -- 68 degrees -- was only two degrees above the norm. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum and minimum humidity readings -- 79% and 34% -- are not that 
unusual either, according to meteorologists. 
</P>
<P>
And the folks over at the Air Quality Management District say the smog readings 
were pretty typical too. 
</P>
<P>
So why did it seem so pleasant? 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of possible reasons, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subtropical Air 
</P>
<P>
A large high-pressure system has been pumping moist subtropical air into 
Southern California from Mexico, according to the people at WeatherData Inc., 
the private meteorological service that provides forecasts for The Times. They 
said it is the sort of situation that occurs fairly often around here in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
This subtropical moisture has meant scattered high clouds and haze that have 
blocked a lot of the direct sunlight, reducing the scorching effect often felt 
from exposure to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
While the maximum humidity readings are not abnormal, they result from this 
subtropical air, rather than from the more familiar overnight incursion of 
marine air from the Pacific. This subtropical humidity, felt during the middle 
of the day, can give the weather a "soft" feel if the temperatures are not too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
As for the bluer skies, that is probably due, in part, to a relatively weak 
inversion layer, again prompted by the subtropical air, according to Claudia 
Keith at the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
"But just because it doesn't look smoggy, that doesn't mean it's not smoggy," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invisible Ozone 
</P>
<P>
Keith explained that, under these weather conditions, the brown haze of 
nitrogen dioxide can disperse quickly into ozone, which is colorless and 
invisible to the eye. And ozone, which irritates and impairs breathing, "is the 
worst component of smog, the one we're most concerned with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to WeatherData's Rick Dittmann, the weather could get a lot more 
dramatic -- and less pleasant -- in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
He said the subtropical moisture was creating thunderstorms in the inland 
desert areas that could cause serious flash-flooding in some areas. And some of 
these thunderstorms, which were straying into the San Gabriel Mountains above 
Los Angeles late Monday, could spill over into the San Gabriel, San Fernando 
and San Bernardino valleys.

And Dittmann said temperatures should be a little warmer today, in the upper

That's probably enough, he said, to convert that nice, "soft" feel into plain, 
old "sticky."

FOREST WILDFIRE NOW CONTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wildfire that raged for 10 days through the Cleveland National Forest and 
burned 15,643 acres of 100-year-old brush, rare Douglas fir trees and part of a 
natural preserve for owls and eagles was fully contained late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 federal, state and local firefighters worked to strengthen fire 
lines on the boundaries of the blaze, which earlier had roared through northern 
San Diego and Riverside counties and threatened the Palomar Mountain 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still smoky, but I don't think you'd find a flame out there if you 
tried," said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Ann Westling. 
</P>
<P>
However, roads leading to the observatory remained closed Monday, and several 
crews and engines were still in that area, Westling said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters now will begin "rehabilitating" the wilderness area by scattering 
seeds and terracing steep slopes to help prevent erosion from winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed one house and several structures, injured at least 37 
firefighters and cost an estimated $6.5 million to control, Westling said.

<TEXT>
<P>
A young mother who abandoned her three children at a hospital before leaving on 
a trip with her boyfriend was sentenced Monday to 180 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deanna Sue Peters, 22, has already served 81 days in jail, including credit for 
good behavior, and has 99 days left to serve on her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Rafael Arreola also placed Peters on five years' 
probation and ordered her to comply with orders issued by the Juvenile Court 
since she lost custody of her children. 
</P>
<P>
The children, all boys, were 4, 2, and 2 months old when they were abandoned 
June 10 at Paradise Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' attorney, Donald LeVine, urged her immediate release from jail. But 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Eugenia Eyherabide urged the 180-day sentence, the maximum 
sentence reached in the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Peters pleaded guilty to one count of child abandonment in July. Two other 
charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said the children have suffered nightmares about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Peters and her boyfriend, Richard Byford, 20, who had been living with Peters' 
mother in Chula Vista, were arrested in Barstow several days after the children 
were abandoned. The couple were reportedly traveling to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Byford pleaded guilty to being an accessory to the crime and last month was 
sentenced to 15 days of public service.

San Diego police Monday were holding a man believed to be responsible for a 
1987 slaying in Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Stewart, 29, phoned police at 8 a.m. Monday and told them he had shot 
and killed Orlando Hawkins on Aug. 11, 1987, said Dave Cohen, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Officers picked up Stewart at the Plaza International Hotel in Mission Valley 
and took him to police headquarters for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Beach police were expected to arrive in San Diego today to question 
Stewart, Cohen said. San Diego police were unsure of the circumstances of the 
killing, and Miami Beach homicide detectives could not be reached.

2ND INMATE IN WEEK ESCAPES FROM COUNTY JAIL IN CASTAIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in a week, an inmate at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho 
broke through wire-mesh screening over a maximum-security jail recreation area 
and escaped from the Castaic compound, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Anderson, 27, of Van Nuys remained at large Monday after escaping from the 
1,780-inmate East Facility between 8:30 and 9 p.m. Sunday, Sheriff's Lt. James 
Valdez said. Anderson had served about three weeks of a one-year sentence for 
carrying a concealed weapon and an unrelated conviction for filing a false 
financial statement, said Deputy Roger Hom, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was scheduled to appear Aug. 14 in Van Nuys Municipal Court on a 
burglary charge, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez said Anderson broke through the wire mesh while standing on an exercise 
bench that he had placed atop a weightlifting device in the courtyard 
recreation area. He pulled back the screen where it meets the courtyard wall, 
climbed through the opening, walked along the roof of the structure and jumped 
at least 12 feet to the ground, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
He then scaled a 12-foot-high chain-link fence topped with razor wire that 
encloses the East Facility and climbed over a second, smaller fence that 
surrounds the entire three-jail Pitchess compound, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez said other inmates were playing volleyball nearby and may have helped 
Anderson escape from the lighted area. After Sunday's escape, officials planned 
to seal the edge of the wire mesh to the wall firmly so that it can't be pried 
back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The escape was similar to one that occurred July 30 at the 1,600-inmate North 
Facility, considered the compound's most secure structure. Rodolfo Corona, 22, 
remains at large after he cut a hole in wire mesh over an enclosed recreation 
area, jumped off the building's roof and scaled a 20-foot-high fence topped 
with razor wire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona was awaiting a preliminary hearing on robbery and kidnaping charges. He 
faced up to 30 years in prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez said he did not know whether Anderson copied Corona's escape. Inmates 
have access to newspapers and television. "If it was on the news, certainly 
they would have seen it. There's no way for us to tell," Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez said the last escape from the East Facility was in March, 1985, when 
seven prisoners, including a murderer, used a pipe to force open a steel screen 
on a window and lowered themselves to the ground with bedsheets that had been 
tied together. 
</P>
<P>
All seven were captured soon afterward.

OLD COURTHOUSE PASSES ASBESTOS TESTS, WILL REOPEN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old San Fernando Courthouse, closed for two days by fears of airborne 
asbestos, was scheduled to reopen today after tests revealed that the amount of 
the cancer-causing fiber in the courthouse air is within legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
However, the California Occupational Safety and Health Agency still is 
investigating the asbestos removal work at the courthouse to determine whether 
workers followed legally dictated procedures for removing the deadly fibers two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-OSHA spokesman Rick Rice said state investigators will interview asbestos 
removal workers to determine if courthouse employees and construction workers 
were exposed to harmful levels of free-floating asbestos when the material was 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said more than 1,000 square feet of ceiling plaster containing 
asbestos and about 50 feet of asbestos insulation for hot water pipes were 
removed in April, May and June as part of a courtroom expansion and remodeling 
project still under way. The Times revealed Thursday that the county apparently 
violated the federal Clean Air Act by failing to notify the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District of the asbestos work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed Friday 
</P>
<P>
Supervising Judge Gregg Marcus of the Los Angeles Municipal Court closed the 
old courthouse Friday afternoon, ordering that proceedings be held in the new 
courthouse and other buildings, after Cal-OSHA officials announced an 
investigation in response to a complaint from a prosecutor who feared that the 
building was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The building remained closed Monday while the tests were processed. Court 
administrator Fritz Ohlrich said the building would be open for normal use 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, once commonly used as an insulator and building material, can lodge 
in the lungs, causing lung cancer, if inhaled. Most contractors now remove 
asbestos uncovered by remodeling work. However, they must follow stringent 
procedures and meet strict guidelines to prevent fibers from becoming airborne. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Allan A. Nadir said he contacted Cal-OSHA after reading news 
reports of apparent Clean Air law violations during the asbestos removal work. 
He was already worried, he said, because early last week a county worker warned 
another city attorney to stay away from a certain area of the building because 
of exposed asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys, he said, were never told that asbestos was removed from the 
building. Court proceedings continued there throughout the remodeling work 
despite large fans blowing thick white dust throughout the building, Nadir 
said. He also said attorneys never saw asbestos removal workers, who wear 
conspicuous head-to-toe protective gear, on the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odd Hours 
</P>
<P>
Project supervisor Thomas Brown said that although the AQMD was not notified, 
the county obeyed all other federal and state rules governing asbestos work. 
Attorneys and judges probably never saw asbestos workers because the actual 
work was carried out at 4 a.m., on weekends and at other off hours, so as not 
to alarm the public, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they did notify Cal-OSHA about the project, also required 
by state law. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cal-OSHA officials have refused to confirm that. Rice said Monday that 
if county officials did not notify Cal-OSHA, they can be cited and that he 
cannot comment on pending citations. 
</P>
<P>
Air samples taken Friday afternoon by Cal-OSHA investigators showed that it was 
safe to resume working in the building, Rice said, but he refused to comment on 
the test results or whether the asbestos levels were close to the maximum 
allowable. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Cal-OSHA investigation probably will be completed this week. If the 
interviews reveal that the county did not remove the fibers properly, the 
county could lose the right to conduct asbestos work and would have to hire 
outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the air district said they were continuing their 
independent investigation.

LOCKHEED SAYS IT WILL PAY $52 MILLION FOR WATER CLEANUP; 
</P>
<P>
DEADLINE PASSES IN EPA ACTION AGAINST 31 FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. has offered to pay $52 million toward the 
Superfund cleanup of Burbank water supply wells, an amount that would cover 
more than half the cost of the 20-year cleanup but still leave millions of 
dollars to be paid by other possible polluters or the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials declined comment Monday on Lockheed's offer. Nor would they 
provide details of settlement proposals by other firms, which had until Monday 
to make a "good faith" offer to aid the ground water cleanup or face possible 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA set the Monday deadline for 31 Burbank-area companies and landowners it 
deemed "potentially responsible" for chemical pollution that has forced Burbank 
to idle its water supply wells and make up the difference with purchased 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of Burbank's 10 municipal wells are contaminated by chemical solvents -- 
principally perchloroethylene, or PCE, and trichloroethylene, or TCE -- and the 
city also has stopped pumping from the three cleaner wells to avoid drawing in 
tainted water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16 Responses 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wilson, an EPA spokesman in San Francisco, said late Monday the agency 
had received "at least sixteen responses" from the targeted firms "and we are 
reviewing all those." He said it might take several days for the agency to 
evaluate the responses. 
</P>
<P>
At least one firm other than Lockheed -- Weber Aircraft -- offered money for 
the cleanup, according to a lawyer for Weber. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that resist paying for Superfund cleanups but are later found liable 
for the pollution can be forced to pay cleanup costs and treble damages, 
creating a strong incentive to settle. 
</P>
<P>
Under orders from state water quality officials, the targeted firms are paying 
consultants to conduct soil and ground water tests to determine if the 
companies leaked or spilled solvents into ground water. So far the only firm 
clearly implicated in the pollution problem is Lockheed, which has found high 
levels of contamination in water beneath its Burbank complex within a few 
hundred feet of some of the Burbank wells. 
</P>
<P>
A vast area of the San Fernando Valley, stretching from North Hollywood east 
into the Verdugo Mountains, has been designated for Superfund cleanup due to 
solvent pollution of ground water tapped for about 15% of area water supplies. 
The federal Superfund program targets the nation's worst toxic waste sites for 
cleanup by those responsible or by the EPA if the polluters cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Affected 
</P>
<P>
Along with Burbank, affected suppliers include the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, the city of Glendale and the Crescenta Valley County Water 
District. In all cases, the main pollutants are PCE and TCE, common solvents 
that are believed to raise the risk of cancer if consumed at low levels over 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
In its settlement offer, mailed to the EPA on Friday, Lockheed said it would 
spend up to $52 million to build an elaborate ground water treatment system, 
and would shed its legal responsibility after running the system for the first 
six years of its 20-year life. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Superfund law, the EPA is to use federal money for cleanup 
only if those responsible cannot be found. Moreover, a firm that helped pollute 
a Superfund site can be made to pay the whole cleanup bill if the liability of 
other firms cannot be proven. 
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, Lockheed called on the EPA to utilize a "mixed funding" 
approach -- using private and federal money -- so the cleanup could start if 
enough private money is not in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, which did not concede to the EPA that it was responsible for the 
pollution, said the agency "lacks sufficient evidence to make an adequate 
causal connection" between the 31 firms and the pollution of Burbank wells. The 
contamination is "probably the result of generalized areawide use" of PCE and 
TCE, Lockheed said, adding that "it would be inequitable to ask one or a few" 
companies to "bear the entire burden of remediation." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's proposal also called for the EPA to abandon its plans for a 
conventional ground water treatment system using aeration, or air-stripping 
towers, and instead to approve the innovative steam treatment method Lockheed 
is using to decontaminate ground water beneath its plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EPA Could Agree 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the EPA spokesman, said the alternative method would not automatically 
create a stumbling block, because the agency can modify its choice of treatment 
"if it's proven that an alternative is a better way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Under the EPA cleanup plan, huge volumes of ground water would be extracted and 
pumped through a series of aeration towers, which use blasts of air to convert 
solvents to vapor. The vapor is then trapped in carbon filters which must be 
recycled or disposed of as hazardous waste. The system would supply the city of 
Burbank with 12,000 gallons per minute of clean water, enough to meet nearly 
three-fourths of the city's current requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is pumping about 1,000 gallons per minute of highly polluted water 
from under its plant, and using steam to remove the solvents. The contaminated 
steam is fed into a condenser to be converted to liquid, and the waste solvent 
is recycled for reuse. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's proposal called for treating and providing Burbank with the same 
volume of water as in the EPA plan, 12,000 gallons per minute. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed officials said they believe the steam treatment system is more 
effective and cheaper to operate. Even so, cost data filed by the company with 
the EPA suggested a total cost well above the EPA's $69 million estimate for 
the air-stripping system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100 Million Total 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Lockheed data showed an annual operation and maintenance cost 
of $3.6 million -- suggesting more than $40 million would have to be spent to 
operate the system in the 14 years after Lockheed's involvement ended. Coupled 
with the $52 million Lockheed proposed spending, the total cost of the 20-year 
project would be close to $100 million, according to Lockheed's figures. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain this, Lockheed spokesman Ross Hopkins said the firm thinks the 
EPA's cost estimate for the air-stripping system may be too low. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed did not provide a cost estimate for the entire 20-year project, but 
Hopkins said he believes the $52 million would cover more than half the total. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA in May gave 27 "potentially responsible parties" until July 7 to make 
settlement offers or risk being taken to court. The deadline later was extended 
to Aug. 7 and four more parties were named. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Burt, a lawyer for Weber Aircraft, said Monday the firm had offered "a 
substantial sum of money" to settle with the EPA, but said he could not be more 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Allied-Signal Aerospace Co., whose electrodynamics division at 
11600 Sherman Way was deemed "potentially responsible," said the firm is 
"certainly making a proposal to the EPA," but would not discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ocean Technology, a defense contractor and subsidiary of 
Alltell Corp. of Hudson, Ohio, said the firm "did not contaminate anything" and 
so has made no offer. Jim Medeiros of Ocean Technology acknowledged that the 
company has found pollution in ground water beneath its plant on North Naomi 
Street. But he said that's due to a "massive migration" of contaminants 
originating uphill from the company and flowing underneath it toward the 
Burbank wells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extension Asked 
</P>
<P>
At least two smaller companies -- Adler Screw Products and De King Screw 
Products -- responded to the deadline by asking for more time to complete soil 
tests that will help determine if they contributed to the pollution. Wilson, 
the EPA spokesman, said late Monday the agency does not intend to grant another 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like asking you to make an offer because you live in Burbank," complained 
Barry Groveman, a lawyer for both firms who previously compared the EPA stance 
to "extortion." 
</P>
<P>
"As we sit here right now, there is no link" between his clients and the 
pollution, Groveman said. "You can't make an offer if you have no facts." 
</P>
<P>
Groveman, former chief environmental prosecutor for the Los Angeles district 
attorney, said the 31 firms and property owners fall into three categories: 
those that know they contributed to the pollution, those that fear they might 
have, and those that have no idea or did not pollute. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the 'no clue or did not' category," said Groveman. 
</P>
<P>
The expensive Burbank cleanup will be but a phase of the effort to reclaim 
Valley ground water supplies. A pilot aeration treatment plant, built with 
federal Superfund monies, is already treating a small volume of DWP well water 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A large treatment system may be constructed near clusters of Los Angeles and 
Glendale wells along the Los Angeles River.

ARSON AT BUDDHIST HOUSE WAS HATE CRIME, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The July 3 firebombing of a Northridge home where Buddhist services were held 
was a "hate crime" motivated by religious or racial prejudice, a report 
presented Monday to the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Pradit and Pachri Phongpharnich and their two children escaped unharmed after 
three firebombs were thrown at their house on Yolanda Avenue, authorities said. 
The roof was badly damaged. No suspects have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
The staff report, requested by the commission, ruled out the possibility that 
the bombing was part of a neighborhood feud, said Eugene Mornell, the 
commission's executive director. The neighbors generally were supportive, 
Mornell said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the arson may have been related to the firebombing of a synagogue in 
Tujunga the same morning and the visit to Los Angeles of the Dalai Lama, the 
exiled Tibetan leader revered by Buddhists, in early July. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department has not concluded its investigation.

A flash fire Monday in a hangar at Fox Airfield in Lancaster injured a mechanic 
who barely escaped fast-moving flames that incinerated the plane he was working 
on, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Reo, 36, of Lancaster, was treated at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical 
Center for first- and second-degree burns to his hands and released Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at the county-operated facility began shortly before 9:30 a.m. and 
caused $150,000 worth of damage, said Capt. Mike Waters of the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in the single-engine Cessna 206 broke out when a short circuit in a 
wing-flap motor caused a spark that ignited gasoline fumes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Reo was doing maintenance work on the wing flaps, officials said. He turned on 
the power of the airplane, then turned on the electric motor to check the wing 
flaps, Investigator Mike Little said. 
</P>
<P>
"That motor is right next to a fuel tank on the wing," Little said. "There must 
have been gas vapors present." 
</P>
<P>
Reo climbed out of the cockpit and ran from the hangar as flames from the 
burning gas tank engulfed the plane, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to destroying the Cessna, owned by Michael Schafer of Lancaster, 
the fire damaged three other planes in adjacent hangars before it was 
extinguished by airport and county fire crews at about 9:50 a.m.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-GIBRALTAR OFFICIAL SENTENCED TO 120 DAYS FOR 
EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former vice president of a North Hollywood financial institution was 
sentenced Monday to 120 days in jail for embezzling $79,000, which he used to 
install a swimming pool and buy paintings for his Agoura Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boulton, 43, also was ordered to repay the money and was placed on 
probation for three years and ordered to perform 150 hours of community 
service. Boulton, who turned himself in to police in January, had pleaded 
guilty in San Fernando Superior Court to grand theft by embezzlement and faced 
a maximum sentence of three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors asked Judge Meredith Taylor for a six-month sentence. The county 
Probation Department recommended that Boulton be placed on probation. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Sue Bilus said arguments for the lighter sentence included 
Boulton's lack of a criminal record and his standing as a productive, educated 
member of society whose new job would be jeopardized by a long sentence. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Boulton used about $75,000 belonging to Gibraltar 
Savings to hire a Van Nuys contracting firm to build a swimming pool in his 
back yard in fall, 1988. He also used more than $4,200 of the bank's money to 
buy three paintings for his living room in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as corporate vice president, Boulton could authorize payments 
for goods, services and labor for the bank, and used those checks to pay for 
the personal items, court documents show.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House voted 257 to 160 to keep the Stealth bomber program alive next fiscal 
year, but on a much leaner budget than President Bush wants and under 
congressional quality controls seen as excessive by many advocates of the 
futuristic warplane. The amendment was added to the $305-billion defense 
authorization bill for fiscal 1990 that later was sent to conference with the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to elude enemy radar and reach targets deep within Soviet territory, 
the nuclear-equipped Stealth, or B-2, would become the new air leg of America's 
air-land-sea "triad" strategy for deterring nuclear war with the Soviets. Each 
plane would cost upwards of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment calls for Congress to appropriate $3.7 billion for Stealth 
research and production next year rather than the $4.7 billion sought by the 
Pentagon, permits only two planes to be built next year rather than the five 
the Administration wants assembled and imposes performance standards on the 
unproven Stealth technology. But the amendment puts production on hold until 
the Administration devises and Congress accepts a scaled-back version of the 
Air Force's present plan to build 132 planes at a cost of $70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

Rail-Based MX 
</P>
<P>
The House adopted 224 to 197 an amendment to strip the 1990 defense bill of 
money for transferring MX missiles from stationary silos to moving railroad 
cars. The rail deployment of U.S. missiles is slated for completion early next 
decade unless a new arms control pact with the Soviet Union rules it out. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment deleted about $500 million in procurement funding while leaving 
about $600 million in the bill for continuing research and development of the 
rail garrison plan. House members later stripped the bill of all of its funding 
for America's other next-generation missile system, the truck-borne Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to slow development of the rail-based MX missile 
system.

SDI Funding 
</P>
<P>
By a 248-175 vote, the House lowered funding for the proposed Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) anti-missile shield by $700 million next fiscal year. That 
reduction combined with an earlier cut in the House Armed Services Committee 
pared President Bush's fiscal 1990 request for SDI from $4.8 billion to $3.1 
billion. The research and development money is contained in the 1990 military 
spending bill (see previous votes). 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to cut SDI funding.

WILLIAMS UNSURE WHEN OR IF HE'LL REJOIN REDSKINS

<P>
Doug Williams doesn't know when he'll be able to play football again. Moreover, 
he isn't sure if he'll be able to play football again. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Redskins' quarterback made that bleak suspicion abundantly clear 
between the lines of a news conference on his return to the Washington 
Redskins' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Asked repeatedly when he might be back in action, Williams reiterated that "my 
objective is to get well." 
</P>
<P>
After a week in Arlington (Va.) Hospital, including several days in traction, 
Williams said he felt "a lot better than last week." 
</P>
<P>
But there is still recurrent pain, especially in the hamstring muscle of his 
right leg, from the "nerve root irritation" in his lower back that stopped 
Williams before he could begin practice this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only play football so long," Williams said, "so I've got to think about 
my health. I'm not a young buck anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has played eight seasons in the National Football League, three 
of them for Washington, will be 34 years old on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He also played in the United States Football League in 1984 and '85 and his 
knees have been sensitive and suspect since arthroscopic surgery seven years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Williams sees an immediate, indefinite future of ultrasound, hot packs, 
traction and stationary bicycle riding, which will begin today. He would not 
project beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he might be able to throw the football "a little," Williams said, 
his voice rising slightly, "I have to get well first." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier meeting with the press, Redskins' Coach Joe Gibbs said he was 
"leaving Doug to his pace, what he can do." Gibbs said once more that nobody 
has yet replaced Williams in his plans as No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a ways to go," Gibbs said. The 80-man roster does not have to be cut 
to 60 until Sept. 29, after exhibition games with the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
Minnesota Vikings and Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs liked what he saw of backup quarterback Mark Rypien and Stan Humphries, 
Rypien's presumable backup, in the Redskins' 31-6 trouncing of the Buffalo 
Bills on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie quarterback Jeff Graham, Gibbs noted, didn't have "much of a chance." He 
may not. The pitching rotation for the game at Pittsburgh on Saturday is Rypien 
followed by Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kenney, seven months older than Williams, is the experienced quarterback 
the Redskins went for when Williams' condition appeared ominous.

NEVIN TELLS THE TITANS HE DOESN'T BLEED DODGER BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Nevin was measured, tested and stretched along with the other rookies on 
Cal State Fullerton's football team Monday, the first day of preseason camp. 
That might seem a small enough thing, but Coach Gene Murphy, badly in need of a 
kicker, can take a bit of comfort in Nevin's presence. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin, the former El Dorado High School kicker whose 57-yard field goal set an 
Orange County high school record last fall, is sitting on an offer from the 
Dodgers, who made him a third-round draft choice in June, shortly after he 
helped lead El Dorado to the Southern Section 5-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Nevin has said he will not turn professional, that he wants to kick and 
play baseball for the Titans. But none of his answers are final until he 
attends his first class at Fullerton on Aug. 28, after which the Dodgers lose 
their rights to him. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Murphy to fidget, uncertain whether Nevin is his for three or four 
years, for one year or at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have been Nevin's favorite team since he was hardly taller than a 
baseball bat, but he has told them no. The Dodgers are offering a signing bonus 
believed to be in six figures. The Dodgers, sensing a draft choice that is 
about to slip away, invited Nevin to Dodger Stadium about three weeks ago and 
let him take batting practice with Mike Marshall and Mike Scioscia. And Nevin 
said thank you for a wonderful afternoon, but no. 
</P>
<P>
"My baseball friends say, 'Sign,' " said Nevin, who played shortstop and hit 
.341 with seven homers last year. "They say, 'You got to be crazy to turn down 
that kind of money and the opportunity to play in Dodger Stadium.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes it so hard. I've grown up a Dodger fan. It's hard for me to 
say no to my all-time dream someday." 
</P>
<P>
Someday. For now, he says, he wants to kick and play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really a money decision," Nevin said. "I made a decision (earlier in 
the year) to play both sports, possibly have a future in both. And I can't have 
a future in football if I don't keep kicking." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Dodgers are offering a considerable sum of money and Murphy is 
offering about a month's room and board for preseason camp at Pacific Christian 
College and a season opener at DeKalb, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this is not strictly a choice between Dodger baseball and Titan 
football. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules would not prohibit Nevin 
from playing college football if he signed with the Dodgers, only baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy said he believes the Dodgers would not want Nevin to kick, perhaps 
because of the risk of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they know something about our offensive line," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin said that if he were to sign -- "and I'm not" -- he would be able to kick 
during his freshman year, but not thereafter. The conflict, he said, is that it 
would be difficult if not impossible to take the academic load necessary for 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
But for all his assurances, there is still uncertainty. Others wonder, and 
Murphy must, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I can change that during camp," said Nevin. "Show him I am the guy 
he expects me to be, do everything he expects me to do. I think I'll be the guy 
he believed me to be." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy needs a kicker, after losing two-year starter Stan Lambert. He also 
needs a punter, after losing four-year starter Jim Sirois. Nevin could fill 
both roles. 
</P>
<P>
Already Nevin is preparing for one of the rule changes in college football this 
year. He is kicking without a tee, as tees will no longer be allowed. To 
adjust, he has gone back to kicking the way he did before high school -- 
barefooted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier for me. When I first started kicking off the ground, my cleats 
were hitting." 
</P>
<P>
So Nevin proceeds, seeming fully intent on the college football season. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 28 will tell. 
</P>
<P>
If he were going to sign, said Nevin, Murphy would find out soon as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd know," Nevin said. "Of anybody, he'd be the first to know. I'm going to 
be around him every day the next five weeks or so. If they want me, they would 
probably have to go through him." 
</P>
<P>
As for Murphy, he has been through this before. In 1984, the Detroit Tigers 
drafted his quarterback, Damon Allen, taking him in the seventh round. 
Preseason camp started, and Allen was still there. To Murphy's discomfort, so 
was a Tiger scout. Perhaps Dodger personnel should take heed. Murphy, in anger, 
found a Tiger cap and burned it. 
</P>
<P>
But on the first day of camp this season, no one was around but the Titan 
coaches and this year's rookies, Nevin in the midst of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having fun already," Nevin said. "And I haven't even been able to kick 
yet." 
</P>
<P>

LEGION FATE OF WOODLAND HILLS WEST LEFT IN THE DARK BY SUSPENDED GAME

It's possible that Ryan McGuire of Woodland Hills West will have better days 
than the one he had Monday in the American Legion California State baseball 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Possible, but not likely. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in eight runs on 
four hits against Napa in a game to determine a berth in the Western Regional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And yet when McGuire awoke this morning, he and his teammates were frozen in 
limbo, as the busy slugfest against Napa was called after seven innings on 
account of darkness with Woodland Hills West leading, 18-12. The game is to be 
resumed this morning at 8. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cool and all," McGuire, 17, said of his day at the plate. "But I would 
have rather K'd (struck out) every time if we could have won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Should Woodland Hills win, it will play Fullerton in the tournament title game 
later today. Should Woodland Hills lose, its tournament stay will be over. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, West rallied in the final three innings to pull out a 9-7 
victory over San Leandro to advance to the game against Napa. 
</P>
<P>
With his team trailing, 5-1, in the seventh, third baseman Del Marine smashed a 
grand slam to left-center field to tie the game. Bobby Kim and Carl McFadden 
added run-scoring hits to give Woodland Hills a 7-5 lead it would never 
relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of this morning's resumed game will automatically clinch a spot in 
the Western Regionals next week as the top two finishers earn berths.

<P>
Lost in the messy late-season business of Al Saunders' firing last December was 
the dramatic improvement of the Chargers' running game in the dying weeks of a 
deadly dull 6-10 season. 
</P>
<P>
Highlight film makers caught the flash of running back Gary Anderson 
waterbugging for 387 yards in the last two games, both victories. 
</P>
<P>
But precious few among even the most seasoned statistical sentinels noticed the 
Chargers' leap from 19th to 12th in NFL rushing between Week 14 and the end of 
the regular season. Only one team, Pittsburgh, rushed for more yards than the 
Chargers in the final two weekends. 
</P>
<P>
And almost nobody bothered to explore the one-word explanation for the 
turnaround: Dirtbags. 
</P>
<P>
Dirtbags? 
</P>
<P>
Dirtbags. 
</P>
<P>
Definition, please. 
</P>
<P>
"Dirtbags; noun," said Charger guard Broderick (Funk &amp; Wagnalls) Thompson. 
"A person who cares only for his own; will protect; will fight only for his 
own." 
</P>
<P>
The Dirtbags came into being innocently enough at a 1988 mid-season meeting 
attended by the five starting offensive lineman -- left tackle Ken Dalliafor, a 
former free agent; left guard Thompson, a former free agent; center Dan Rosado, 
a former free agent; right guard Dennis McKnight, a former free agent and right 
tackle David Richards, a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome, now an assistant with the Cowboys, walked 
into the room with an idea and a speech. 
</P>
<P>
Here's Richards' version of what Rhome said: 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody thinks you guys are worth anything. But I know better. You guys are a 
bunch of dirtbags. You're dirty. You're nasty. You're fighters. And you're 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
"And we were," Richards said. "When everybody thinks you stink, it takes all 
the pressure off. There was no reason for us to perform the way we did those 
last games. But we rose above the negative publicity and went a step beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Richards wound up on the United Press International all-rookie team. McKnight's 
peers around the league voted him an alternate to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Washington's porcine "Hogs," nobody chronicled the Charger line. 
Nobody printed up T-shirts. Anderson never even got around to buying them 
gifts, the way Walter Payton always used to do for his linemen at the end of 
every season in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't have to advertise it," McKnight said. "We just knew in our 
own little hearts who we were. There wasn't a whole lot of fanfare outside of 
our own little circle." 
</P>
<P>
And, alas, the Dirtbags are already a fading memory. When Charger owner Alex 
Spanos fired Saunders and hired Dan Henning to replace him as coach, Rhome saw 
the handwriting on the wall and departed for Dallas. Offensive line coach Jerry 
Wampfler now works in Detroit, where he coaches Dalliafor, whom the Chargers 
lost in the Plan B free agency phase. 
</P>
<P>
And new Charger line coach Larry Beightol already has instituted massive 
position changes. Richards is a guard. McKnight is fighting for a starting spot 
at center. Rosado finds himself trying to beat out fellow Dirtbag Thompson at 
left guard. 
</P>
<P>
Henning was an offensive coach in Washington, where the Hogs' trademark was 
size. During the off-season he asked Steve Ortmayer, Charger director of 
football operations, to find the biggest offensive linemen available. 
</P>
<P>
Right now five Charger offensive linemen weigh 300 pounds or more. At the end 
of 1988, only Richards weighed that much. Dalliafor was positively petite at 
275. But his teammates called him "Diesel" because of the way he chugged around 
the field. They also called him "Boomerang." No matter how many times teams cut 
him, he always came back. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny would go from the snap to the end of the whistle and maybe just beyond 
the whistle on every play," Rosado said. "And if someone was standing around, 
whether it was legitimate or not, Kenny would hit him. That's kind of the way 
football is supposed to be played. You better not be standing around the pile 
with Kenny around. And that stuff's contagious." 
</P>
<P>
Dalliafor, Thompson said, was definitely the dirtiest of the Dirtbags. "He 
would do anything possible to make a block," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dirtbags will not wallow in the past. "It was a special group of guys and a 
special time," McKnight said. "But we're a thing of the past. It's time to move 
on to other things." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Dirtbag alumni can't squabble over whose view of history is 
more or less revisionist than another's. Or whose gaze into the future is more 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
"Each line has to develop a new identity," McKnight was saying recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we get settled in," piped up Richards, who was standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"He is interviewing me," McKnight snarled at Richards, "not you." 
</P>
<P>
This was vintage Dirtbag. Offensive linemen are among the least publicized 
among NFL players. And in this case, hell would see no fury like a Dirtbag 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
But for one fleeting period of their lives, the Dirtbags were a unit, a 
concert, a living breathing illustration of how the O's are supposed to destroy 
the X's, just like they draw it up on the blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
"There nothing more exciting than to pull around on a counter gap and come 
walking through a big hole that you could drive a truck through," Richards 
said. "The guard's kicked out on the end and you run up in there in the hole 
and you hit somebody and roll around on the ground and there goes Gary Anderson 
just cruising down the field. And you say, 'Yeah, we got him through.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to tell. But right now Richards is the only Dirtbag with 
reasonable assurance he will be starting again in 1989. But whoever Henning and 
Beightol decide upon when the regular season begins against the Raiders Sept. 
10, it won't be the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The line," Beightol says, "is going to look a lot different this year." 
</P>
<P>
Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Dirt to bag. 
</P>
<P>
"But to be a Dirtbag was a good thing," Thompson said. "It was a private club. 
It was exclusive. You had to have membership to get in. And it was an elite 
club as far as we were concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Williams would have loved the Dirtbags. Sort of like the Dead Poet's 
Society. But Williams is famous and the Dirtbags are not. He would not have 
been welcome in their circle.

GUIDEBOOKS TAKE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON GOOD AND BAD OF TRAVEL IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Come summer vacation time and some of the people who know Orange County least 
-- tourists from Nebraska to Nepal -- decide to pay Orange County a visit. 
</P>
<P>
One travel book, "Birnbaum's United States 1989," explains the tourist lure of 
Orange County with one word: Disneyland. "For many people this is the most 
compelling magnet in all of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
But there are many more travel books -- and as many differing views -- that 
give tourists an impression of Orange County long before they step off the bus. 
And the more they read, the more confused they can get. 
</P>
<P>
Read "Los Angeles Access" (1987) and you want to book your flight right now. 
This book regards the Orange County coast as "an earthly paradise of temperate 
climate, a shoreline of alternating smooth sandy beaches with majestic rocky 
promontories, green canyons, rolling hills and a feeling of suspended time." 
</P>
<P>
But read "Let's Go: Budget Guide to California and Hawaii" (1989) and you'd 
rather visit a Pittsburgh slag heap: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Orange County was divided and subdivided. Ridiculously broad avenues 
formed an immense grid, which the years filled with cookie-cutter copies: gas 
stations on every corner, supermarkets on every block, and other necessities of 
life provided at more malls, plazas, squares, centers and markets than any real 
city could handle." 
</P>
<P>
Some cities are praised: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Laguna is undoubtedly Orange County's vacation paradise, with more 
charm per square inch than any place south of Carmel. . . . The incredibly 
lovely setting and the small-town atmosphere will leave you feeling renewed, 
relaxed and refreshed." ("The Best of Los Angeles," 1988). 
</P>
<P>
And some cities are merely dismissed: 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim is Disneyland," concludes "Frommer's Dollarwise California and Las 
Vegas" (1989), and "there is no reason to stay here unless you plan to linger 
at the Magic Kingdom," according to "Let's Go." 
</P>
<P>
That is what hundreds of thousands of tourists do year after year -- check into 
an Anaheim motel and soak up the amusement park scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim is indisputably the West's capital of family entertainment," states 
"Fodor's 89 Los Angeles." "With Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Movieland 
Wax Museum, there are as many rides and attractions, color and merriment as 
anyone could want." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly as much as the John and Kay Duplock family wants. Their devotion to 
Orange County tourism could qualify them as the tourist bureau's poster family. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Duplocks traveled yet again to Anaheim from their home in 
Leicestershire, England, with their son Richard, 6, daughter Laura, 9 months, 
and John's parents, George and Ruby Duplock. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Duplocks' third trip to "the states," which to them always means a 
trip to Anaheim and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
John, a painting contractor, said it was the family's ninth day spent at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everything's So Cheap' 
</P>
<P>
"We don't go to L.A. much," said Kay. "We took a tour that shows you the 
sights, but we never stepped off." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's so cheap here," John said. "Your houses are expensive, but where 
we ate last night my meal cost me seven dollars fifty for the whole lot. That's 
about 6 (actually closer to 4.50). In England, that meal's 10 or 12 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Kay estimated that by the time the family returns home, their trip to Orange 
County will have cost them about $6,000, not including the grandparents' 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year's a car," John said. "Then we're back here." 
</P>
<P>
So what do the Duplocks think of Orange County? "We always stay in Anaheim 
mainly," John said. "Everywhere it's clean and tidy." 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes family from Moline, Ill., were also staying in Anaheim but conceded 
they knew little of Orange County outside the park's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Ellen Hughes with sons Steve, 12, and Andrew, 5, had arrived Tuesday 
and had toured Disneyland. When the family heads home, they will have bestowed 
most of $3,000 on the Orange County economy, Jim estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Had they formed any impression at all about Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic isn't as bad as people said it was going to be," Ellen said. "It 
seems a lot better than last time." The family last vacationed in Anaheim in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Jim said he had certainly formed one impression. Back at the motel "they don't 
trust anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was going to call Dodger Stadium for baseball tickets, "and to start with, I 
can't believe that calling Dodger Stadium is long distance." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, "the manager says we can't call without putting down a $20 deposit, and 
I was using my credit card." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, it's better than going to Walt Disney World in Florida. "Disney 
World is nice, but there's not as much to do around there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Others See Us 
</P>
<P>
Comments on Orange County excerpted from these travel books: 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles Access" (1987) 
</P>
<P>
"The Best of Los Angeles" (1988) 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Go: Budget Guide to California and Hawaii" (1989) 
</P>
<P>
"Fodor's 89 Los Angeles" (1989) 
</P>
<P>
"Frommer's Dollarwise California and Las Vegas" (1989) 
</P>
<P>
. . . one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, struggling with 
issues of growth and traffic. . . . The county has been shaped by large 
capitalist forces. Much of it is owned by several of the powerful companies 
that helped build it: Irvine, Segerstrom, Koll. Many of the newer cities (such 
as Irvine) are planned communities that serve as models for other cities around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor's 
</P>
<P>
For tourism purposes, Orange County can be divided into two areas -- the coast 
and the inland region, each with a totally different feel. There is the 
hustle-bustle on the inland, with its family-oriented attractions, and there is 
the more low-key 'cas' beach atmosphere. Not that there is nothing to do at the 
beaches besides loll in the sun, but the pace really is different. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor's 
</P>
<P>
Although physically Anaheim, Buena Park and Irvine are among the most 
unprepossessing towns in California, they are also the ones that attract the 
most visitors. For if the natural surroundings are uninspiring and the streets 
lack any vestige of charm, the man-made attractions off the streets are 
enchanting. 
</P>
<P>
Frommer's 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland is the kingdom where fantasy and magic are around the next turnstile 
and dreams are as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Access 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim is Disneyland. 
</P>

Anaheim is not exactly one of the world's gourmet capitals. 
</P>

<P>
The Orange County restaurant scene often seems to be playing catch-up with Los 
Angeles, but it's certainly a leader when it come to airport restaurants. While 
LAX is notoriously bleak dining territory, John Wayne Airport benefits from 
Orange County's habit of putting its fanciest restaurants in hotels. 
</P>

Everything here operates on the scale of the automobile, so forget about

The Orange County Transit Department (sic) will take you virtually anywhere in 
the county, but, again, it will take time. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor's 
</P>
<P>
Tourists continue to flock here in record numbers. For good reason: When the 
Beach Boys sang about 'Fun, Fun, Fun' and 'California Girls,' they were singing 
about Orange County's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Best of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing behind the Orange Curtain is access to a variety of beaches. The 
coastal towns from Seal Beach to San Onofre offer everything from unstudied 
California cool to overpowering quaintness.

Laguna Beach is an art colony as intimate and colorful as any seaside resort on 
the French Riviera.

L.A. Access

<P>
The coast between Huntington and Newport beaches is one of the only stretches 
of shoreline between Los Angeles and San Diego free of condominiums. 
Unfortunately, what is there is worse: a huge power plant, miscellaneous power 
lines, acres of oil wells and miles of rusty chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
Let's Go 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach is the place to summer if George and Barbara haven't invited you 
to Kennebunkport. All those L.L. Bean and Land's End catalogue boys and girls 
can feel right at home here among other California prepsters similarly mad 
about madras. The rich tend to be nouveau, and the sunglasses are Vuarnet (on a 
neck cord). 
</P>
<P>
Let's Go 
</P>
<P>
Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve. Perhaps our favorite place in the 
Newport-Laguna area. Its serenity is broken only by singing birds and duck 
discussions -- or by an occasional motorist. . . . The silence here is a 
welcome respite. 
</P>
<P>
Best of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous and most scenic route in Orange County is, without a doubt, the 
Pacific Coast Highway. . . . The most spectacular view (one threatened by 
development and which may already be gone by the time you read this) is between 
Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach. 
</P>

More tourists than swallows return to Mission San Juan Capistrano. . . . This 
'jewel of the missions' offers a peek at what, to Californians, is ancient 
history. . . . The swallows are scheduled to return to Capistrano on St. 
Joseph's Day, March 19, but being neither religious nor punctual, they show up 
even when there aren't busloads of tourists hanging around.

San Clemente is probably best remembered as the site of the Western White House 
during the Nixon years. . . . Perhaps even more infamous than Nixon's house is 
the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant (sic), a controversial installation lending 
an eerie feeling to the nearby beach.

SEVERAL COUNTY S&amp;LS NEED CASH TO MEET RULES OF BAILOUT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least seven savings and loans in Orange County need cash infusions to help 
them meet tougher capital regulations imposed under the $166-billion industry 
bailout bill that President Bush is expected to sign Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging from healthy to nearly insolvent, the S&amp;Ls are among nearly 1,000 
thrifts nationwide that do not now meet one or both of the new requirements for 
capital, and their futures may depend on their ability to raise the needed 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
At least three of the seven S&amp;Ls based in Orange County already are nearly 
insolvent but have not been seized by regulators. At least four of them are 
actively looking for merger partners that would provide new capital. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is going to have the effect of causing the additional closure of 
about 500 S&amp;Ls nationwide that do not have the prospect of raising the 
necessary capital," said Edward Carpenter of Southport/Carpenter Group, a Santa 
Ana financial-institutions consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Capital is an institution's final cushion against losses. It is the amount 
investors put up to start the business and any additional amount put in, 
through retained earnings and subsequent stock offerings, to help it grow. 
S&amp;L regulations offered a set of additional items to bolster sagging 
capital levels in the 1980s, but the new bill strips those items away. 
</P>
<P>
"A tougher capital requirement means S&amp;L owners will have more of their own 
money at stake," said Alex Sheshunoff, an Austin, Tex., industry consultant. 
"No longer will a handful of S&amp;Ls be able to simply bet taxpayer-insured 
dollars in hopes of a profit." 
</P>
<P>
The bailout bill also means that a separate S&amp;L industry is an endangered 
species, said Gerry Findley, a Brea industry consultant. Besides imposing 
tougher regulations, the bill will allow banks to buy healthy S&amp;Ls, and 
Findley expects the industry to disappear slowly through mergers and 
consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will turn S&amp;L survivors into different kinds of institutions, 
said Charles H. Green, acting president of FarWest Savings &amp; Loan in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill requires you to engage in a narrower business, to pay higher premiums 
for insurance deposit and to increase your capital," he said. "Those elements 
don't work well together, and many institutions will fail. And the survivors 
will be converting to banks sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
FarWest is one of the seven Orange County thrifts that must raise capital. But 
it needs only a slight amount, for its size, and is a healthy institution with 
a financially sound parent that could meet the new requirements easily, Green 
and consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
The other S&amp;Ls needing capital are Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach, 
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach, Delta Savings Bank in 
Westminster, Constitution Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Tustin, Huntington 
Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach and Security Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The list does not include four insolvent county S&amp;Ls already seized by 
regulators. They are Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, Pacific Savings Bank 
in Costa Mesa, First California Savings in Orange and Perpetual Savings Assn. 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The bill spells out two capital tests that S&amp;Ls must meet. Under one test, 
S&amp;Ls will need 1.5% of their assets in what is called tangible capital -- 
the basic cash that has been put into the institutions over the years. Over 
five years, that ratio must be raised to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Under the other test, they must maintain a 3% ratio of core capital to assets. 
Core capital includes "good will," which is the value that one company pays in 
excess for the basic value of a firm it acquires. Good will now must be written 
off over 20 to 40 years, but the new bill requires that it be eliminated within 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
The healthiest of the Orange County thrifts facing capital problems is FarWest, 
with $4.6 billion in assets. The S&amp;L has an estimated tangible capital 
ratio of 2.21% and a core capital ratio of 2.58%, according to March 31 
regulatory figures compiled by Sheshunoff's firm. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Sheshunoff's report on March financial results, other county S&amp;Ls 
need more help: 
</P>
<P>
* Charter Savings would have negative tangible capital but would almost have 
enough core capital. Its problem is about $13 million in good will it took on 
from the acquisition last year of the failed Merit Savings Bank in Los Angeles. 
Saying Charter is "no different" than it was a year ago, Jon Maddox, its 
president, said the S&amp;L's owner, Mola Development Co., "will do whatever is 
necessary to comply" with the new regulations, even if it means putting $4 
million more into Charter and reducing its assets to $300 million from its June 
30 level of $429 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Mercury Savings, which had a well-publicized fight with its auditors and 
posted $13.8 million in red ink last year, comes up short under both capital 
tests. It is a solvent institution, and its chairman, Leonard Shane, has said 
repeatedly that it meets current regulatory levels for capital and will 
continue to meet new requirements. He also has repeatedly denied that the 
S&amp;L he co-founded 25 years ago is on the block and has said he is not 
actively soliciting bids for Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
* Delta Savings would fall short of one test and drop into insolvency under the 
other. But four investors are awaiting regulatory approval to take a 64% stake 
in the S&amp;L and pump $2 million in cash into the capital base, said Joseph 
Gaskill, Delta's president. The S&amp;L, which caters to the Vietnamese 
community, has been cutting losses that were generated from bad loans that went 
sour up to six years ago, and should be well off once regulators approve the 
change in control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Constitution Federal's capital was 0.34% of its assets under either test. The 
S&amp;L, wracked by $6 million in losses over six years, has turned in modest 
profits for the last two years, said its president, Joseph Helleis. An 
ownership fight involving a 63% stake has dragged on for three years, he said, 
hindering merger efforts. He said the S&amp;L will end up "pretty close" to the 
1.5% tangible capital level in October. 
</P>
<P>
* Huntington Savings, often wooed but never wed, had little more than $200,000 
in capital, only 0.17% of its assets and far below either test. With its 
operations turned around, according to previous statements, it has been trying 
to raise up to $6 million in new capital from current shareholders and new 
investors. Officers could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
* Security Federal would be insolvent under either test in the bill. It had 
less than $1 million in capital and was heading toward insolvency. Regulators 
installed new management at the Garden Grove thrift in June without seizing it, 
and the new management team said then that it believes that the S&amp;L can be 
turned around -- with some more capital and a good business plan. Officers 
could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
For all the emphasis on capital levels, at least one industry consultant 
believes that it won't have as much effect as industry critics would like. 
</P>
<P>
"Regulators have a lot of latitude to let thrifts operate below the capital 
limits," said Bert Ely of Ely &amp; Co. in Alexandria, Va. "The consequences of 
failing to comply is that the regulators can grant exemptions."

Microsemi Corp., a Santa Ana semiconductor manufacturer, reported a loss of 
$707,000 for its fiscal third quarter ended July 2, its first quarterly loss in 
eight years. The loss contrasts with earnings of $548,000 for the corresponding 
quarter the year before. The firm put the primary blame for the loss on the 
cancellation of a $10-million contract with a San Diego-based unit of General 
Instrument Corp. Microsemi had expected the contract to contribute $1.2 million 
in sales and $400,000 in gross profit for the latest quarter. David R. Sonksen, 
a Microsemi vice president, said the company has filed a lawsuit against 
General Instrument, claiming that the New York-based electronics firm breached 
the terms of its contract with Microsemi. Microsemi's revenues grew 21% to 
$26.4 million for the quarter, up from $21.7 million for the period in the 
previous year.

IRVINE CO. DETAILS PLANS FOR 3 RETAIL PROJECTS IN SPECTRUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Co. announced Monday that it plans to develop three new retail 
projects totaling more than 800,000 square feet in the master-planned Irvine 
Spectrum area. 
</P>
<P>
The three projects, which will cost a total of $50 million, are aimed at 
employees of the hundreds of businesses in the Irvine Spectrum center, at the 
juncture of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
With the three new centers, the Irvine Co.'s retail projects in Orange County 
will total about 4 million square feet -- making the privately owned firm the 
largest retail developer in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. owns the Irvine Spectrum, a 2,600-acre phased development that 
already is headquarters for more than 600 companies with about 20,000 
employees. Firms located there include such heavy-hitters as Mazda North 
America Inc., AT&amp;T, Kawasaki Motors Corp. and Toshiba America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Spectrum is not scheduled to be completed until the turn of the century 
-- when Irvine Co. executives estimate that it will be home for up to 100,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're developing (the retail projects) to meet those needs," said Keith C. 
Eyrich, vice president of development for Irvine Retail Properties Co., a 
division of the Irvine Co. "The market is businesses and employees of those 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
To attract employees of the Irvine Spectrum area, the three retail projects 
will be home to some discount retailers plus a heavy concentration of 
restaurants and fast-food outlets, dry cleaners, hair stylists, and 
business-support firms, such as photocopying outlets, Eyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the centers are to be the size of a typical community shopping center, 
while the smallest is to be the size of a neighborhood shopping center. Large 
regional malls are generally 1 million square feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. will be executive developer overseeing the initial planning, 
layout and design of the projects. It is working with two Newport Beach 
developers -- SDC Development Co. and Hopkins Development Co. -- that will be 
in charge of day-to-day construction. 
</P>
<P>
Here are details of the projects: 
</P>
<P>
* Construction will start early next year on the first phase of a 10- to 
12-acre development at the corner of Alton Parkway and Technology Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Phase One will have 120,000 square feet of retail space, including a food 
court, restaurants, a gas station and car wash, and shops. It is being 
developed by Hopkins and the Irvine Co. and is scheduled for completion in 
spring 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase is still being planned. It will include 310,000 square feet of 
retail space on an additional 30 or more acres, Eyrich said. Plans include 
discount retailers. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction is scheduled to begin in the fall of 1990 on a 40-acre site 
bordered by Irvine Center Drive and Lake Forest Drive south of the Santa Ana 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Retail space in the project will total 300,000 square feet, anchored by 
discount stores supported by restaurants, business-support and neighborhood 
services. The project is being developed by SDC with the Irvine Co. and is 
scheduled to open in the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* Ground breaking is planned in late 1990 on a 14-acre site southwest of the 
San Diego Freeway at Irvine Center Drive near the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
The center will include 120,000 square feet of retail space, with a scheduled 
opening in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the ambitious plans announced this week, Eyrich acknowledged 
that none of the space is yet leased. 
</P>
<P>
Even though all three of the centers are aimed at the employees at Irvine 
Spectrum, Eyrich said they are expected to draw consumers from a three- to 
five-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. also still plans to build a 5-million-square-foot regional mall 
in the Spectrum area, Eyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rouse Co., based in Baltimore, Md., is doing feasibility studies on adding 
a regional mall to the site and "working with anchor prospects," Eyrich said. 
The mall has been on the drawing boards for at least 10 years.

NEWPORT ELECTRONICS BOARD ENDORSES SENSOR CONTROL'S MERGER TENDER OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Electronics Inc.'s directors Monday endorsed a tender offer and merger 
proposal from Sensor Control Corp., saying it is superior to a sweetened offer 
from a rival bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor, a Silicon Valley maker of heat and pressure sensors, is offering to buy 
43% of Newport's outstanding shares for $9.75 each, and to buy the remaining 
shares for $9 each. 
</P>
<P>
Newport officials said the Sensor offer is better than one made by Connecticut 
investor Milton B. Hollander. On July 26, Hollander offered to pay $11-a-share 
for 35% of Newport's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Newport previously rejected a $9.50-a-share offer from Hollander. Hollander 
owns or indirectly controls about 13% of Newport's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Newport said its board supports the Sensor merger because the 
panel "still believes the potential acquisition of all the shares of common 
stock, instead of the partial tender offer for only approximately 35% . . . is 
in the best interest of the company's shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
"We're recommending the proposed merger" with Sensor, said Norman Gray, 
Newport's director. "But this is a decision that each individual shareholder 
has to make." 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders will vote on the merger in early September.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the savings-and-loan rescue bill finally on its way to President Bush, 
some of the provisions seem to have had an immediate effect on San Diego 
savings-and-loan stocks, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas 
Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank gained $1.625 after Monday's Wall Street Journal featured 
it on the front page as a potential takeover candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislation permits commercial banks to acquire healthy as well as 
failing S&amp;Ls. The article noted that Wells Fargo, which has been trying to 
expand in Southern California, is believed to be interested in Great American's 
excellent branch system. 
</P>
<P>
With Great American stock selling at 65% of tangible book value, an acquiring 
bank could offer twice its present market price of $11.25 a share and still 
obtain a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Another good gainer was Home Federal, which was up $1.75 as it got closer to 
exiting FSLIC and its high premiums in favor of the FDIC and its lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
A new high of $25.25 was made by Mail Boxes Etc., which opened its 1,000th 
franchise. First National Corp. issued a 10% stock dividend, a dilution that 
was reflected in the $.875 drop in the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Although the American Stock Exchange averages have continued to record new 
highs, some of the San Diego stocks listed on the AMEX have been falling to new 
lows, including Precision Aerotech, which was down to $2.50. TCS Enterprises, 
whose 19% stake formerly held by Lincoln Savings is now in the hands of 
government regulators, hit a new low of $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Biomagnetic Technologies, which just went public last week at $9, hit a new low 
of $8.

MARKET TUNES IN TO DATRON DESPITE DEFENSE CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In these days of defense budget cuts, Datron Systems in Simi Valley wouldn't 
seem to have a chance of appealing to investors. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Datron is a small electronics concern that sells its products mainly 
to defense and other U.S. government agencies. Datron's products, which 
accounted for sales of $37 million in its fiscal year ended March 31, include 
antennas for tracking satellites, simulators for jet pilots and military 
radios. 
</P>
<P>
Datron's stock is thinly traded, making it harder for investors to buy or sell 
at prices they want, when they want. The company has a modest 2.7 million 
shares outstanding, and 25% of those are held by company insiders. Only a 
handful of Wall Street analysts bother to follow Datron. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm's President 
</P>
<P>
"Conventional wisdom dictates that small-capitalization defense electronics 
companies should be shunned" by the market, especially when defense spending is 
shrinking, said David A. Derby, Datron's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
But so much for conventional wisdom. Investors are increasingly taking note of 
Datron, and its stock, which closed Friday at $12 a share in over-the-counter 
trading, is hovering near its all-time high since the company went public for 
$8.875 a share in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Datron's sales have jumped 65% over the past two years; its profit doubled 
in the same period to $3.5 million in fiscal 1988, and its order backlog is 
climbing sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, investors see Datron -- a diversified company despite its small size 
-- evading the budget-cutters' knives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Order Cuts Doubts 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't seem to be involved in the types of programs that seem likely 
to get canceled," said Edward G. Shufro, a partner in the New York 
money-management firm Shufro, Rose &amp; Ehrman, which is Datron's biggest 
stockholder with 18% of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
Datron, Shufro and other investors are betting that the defense cutbacks will 
focus mostly on armaments, with the government building fewer missiles, planes 
and ships. They see a continued need for Datron's antennas, radios and 
simulators even if the Defense Department orders fewer guns and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the communications business, not the defense business," said Derby, a 
48-year-old Iowa native who helped start Datron in 1969. "Whether there's a 
500-ship Navy or a 600-ship Navy doesn't make much difference to us. We will 
continue to have a Navy . . . somebody's got to talk to the ships" with the 
help of Datron's antennas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Datron also is looking beyond the military. In April, it received an 
$18-million, four-year subcontract from Raytheon to provide the mount and other 
primary mechanical parts of antennas for use on the Terminal Doppler Weather 
Radar system, a federal program aimed at helping airline pilots detect 
dangerous wind-shear conditions near airports. 
</P>
<P>
That program helped Datron's order backlog surge to a record $36 million as of 
June 30, up from $28 million three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Datron also jumped recently into the market for sophisticated training 
simulators for pilots. They're not the simulators that depict a cockpit; 
rather, they are systems that send simulated radar and missile-attack signals 
to pilots flying real military jets nearby. The idea is to test the pilot under 
actual flying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which sits atop a flatbed truck so that it can be moved and 
surprise the pilots, "does everything except fire a missile" at the jets, Derby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth Seen 
</P>
<P>
The simulators are "going to be an area of significant growth" for Datron, 
predicted Lawrence Harris of the investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
in Los Angeles. He said the simulator business should provide about $5 million 
of Datron's sales this fiscal year, up from $3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Datron, which has 350 employees, also makes high-frequency radio systems for 
the military and other agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service, that want to 
communicate over the horizon without using satellites or wires to transmit 
their signals. The radios' frequencies reach the upper atmosphere and bounce 
over the horizon to enable the users to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Datron got into that business in 1985 by acquiring Trans World Communications 
for $9 million, and Bateman Eichler's Harris predicts that the radio group will 
kick in about $13 million of Datron's estimated $43 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of Datron's business is its satellite antenna and communications 
business, which accounts for more than half of its sales. These include 
ground-based antenna stations, which are several stories high and are used to 
track satellites and electronically change their orbit. They cost upwards of $1 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
The satellites might be used by the military for surveillance, or might be 
so-called "earth resources" satellites that monitor weather patterns or 
photograph crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Satellite Antennas 
</P>
<P>
Datron's products also include antennas no more than six feet high that are 
placed aboard Navy ships to track the military's satellite system (MILSTAR). 
Since 1976, Datron has delivered 408 such antennas to the Navy, and 31 more are 
to be shipped. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, analysts estimate that Datron's work on MILSTAR equipment could total 
up to $100 million over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Datron is not a manufacturer of its products; it's more of an 
assembler. Datron's engineers design an antenna, the company then buys many of 
its components (although it makes some of its own) and then assembles the 
equipment for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Datron's expertise is in designing and building the guts of a system -- the 
base, all the mechanical parts, the electronic systems -- then it buys a dish 
to complete the product. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a factory that stamps out metal panels for antennas," Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
Datron has plenty of competition. Scientific-Atlanta vies with Datron in 
satellite-tracking antennas, and General Dynamics makes simulators for jet 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Datron was started by Derby and seven other people and remained privately held 
for 10 years. The company grew slowly, in part because the founder-owners 
focused heavily on developing their products and not enough in marketing them, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the company was acquired by Hale Technology Corp., a San 
Francisco-based concern that has since liquidated; but by 1985, Datron was spun 
off into a publicly held concern again. Derby was named chief executive in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Derby, an amateur pilot, attended what is now Cal State Northridge, studying 
electronics, and also was an electronics technician in the Navy between 1959 
and 1962. He first worked for Litton Industries, then for a company called 
Canoga Electronics, which also made antennas. That's where he met Datron's 
other co-founders. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Derby compared himself to little more than the coach of a team 
-- a coach who earned $381,500 in salary and other compensation last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot design any of our products," he said, "and I certainly cannot produce 
them. I can't do anything other than define the plays that we need to run and 
get the people we need to run them to want to." 
</P>
<P>
So what's his next series of plays? 
</P>
<P>
"We have to build the best product at the lowest price," he said. "It's 
simple."

VALLEY EARNINGS: TANDON LOSES $1.99 MILLION IN QUARTER, BLAMES DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tandon Corp., a Moorpark maker of personal computers, reported a loss of $1.99 
million for the second quarter ended June 30, compared to a $6-million profit a 
year earlier. Revenue in the latest quarter increased 20% to $97.7 million from 
$81.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the loss on the recent strength of the U.S. dollar, which 
has made overseas sales more difficult. About 86% of Tandon's sales are in 
Europe. Tandon said it is taking steps to make its European operations more 
self-sufficient, which should lessen its vulnerability to exchange-rate 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended in June, Tandon lost $11.9 million, compared to $13.2 
million in net income a year earlier. Revenue increased 18% to $190.4 million 
from $161.5 million.

COSTA MESA ARTS PANEL ADVANCES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council took a major step today to create a new agency 
intended to provide continuous, stable funding for the arts and tourism that 
city officials say could substantially increase cultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
At a regular meeting, the City Council voted unanimously to establish the Costa 
Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Council, a nonprofit public corporation to be 
run by a five-member volunteer board of Costa Mesa residents yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole intent of this was not to have arts grants dependent on what we can 
squeeze out of the general fund and to increase arts funding," Mayor Peter F. 
Buffa said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, initially designed to address a rise in requests for arts subsidies 
and more efficiently handle an ever-increasing number of cultural grant 
requests, "will amount to substantially more for the arts," even while sharing 
funds with the tourism industry, Buffa said.

Pat Murphy, publisher of the Arizona Republic and the Phoenix Gazette, resigned 
today. His statement did not cite a reason. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 59, had been publisher for three years and had spent 14 years before 
that on the Republic staff. The president of the Indianapolis company that 
controls the newspapers said a search for Murphy's successor will begin 
immediately. Central Newspapers Inc. is owned by the Pulliam family and 
includes Vice President Dan Quayle as one of its owners. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy took an active role as publisher, describing maverick Republican Gov. 
Evan Mecham as a brutish, ideological juggernaut even as Mecham attacked the 
newspapers and their reporting. Mecham, who was ousted by a Senate Court of 
Impeachment last year, called Murphy's departure "good news" today, adding: "I 
hope they can rebuild a little credibility to the newspaper."

An apparently gang-related drive-by shooting left an 18-year-old Panorama City 
man in critical condition, Los Angeles police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Garcia, 18, was shot about 11:45 p.m. Monday in the back and right arm 
while standing on a curb near his residence in the 14600 block of Blythe 
Street, Detective Ernie Guzman said. No one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police said four men in a car apparently drove past Garcia, then turned around 
at a roadblock installed by the city across Blythe at Willis Avenue to 
discourage drug and gang activities. Police said that as the car passed Garcia, 
a gang slogan was yelled from the car and Garcia was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills where he was in 
critical condition this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the assailants are believed to be from a gang based outside 
the Blythe Street neighborhood and that it is unclear whether Garcia was a 
rival gang member.

A man walked into the middle of a Granada Hills street and shot himself to 
death in front of two police officers this morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Zuniga, 20, of Sylmar, who was apparently distraught over the breakup of a 
relationship, fatally shot himself while standing in the 15500 block of Rinaldi 
Street despite pleas from the two officers to drop the weapon, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers were called by passers-by who reported a man with a gun, Sgt. Paul 
Haberman said. 
</P>
<P>
"When they got there they were confronted by a man who got out of a car with a 
gun in his hand," Haberman said. "He asked the officers to kill him. The 
officers just took cover." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the officers told Zuniga to drop the gun but he walked into the 
middle of the street, fired one shot into the air and then one into his chest. 
He died at the scene. A woman who was in the car with Zuniga was unhurt.

BUSH VOWS TO STOP DECLINE OF INNER CITIES;

President Bush, telling a group of civil rights leaders, "Your problems are my 
problems," vowed today to work toward stopping the decline of inner cities and 
making "the '90s a decade of urban renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
"We must create conditions for urban growth and economic revival, conditions 
that leave no one behind," Bush said in remarks to the 79th annual meeting of 
the National Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no mention of current disputes between his Administration and civil 
rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Striking Down Barriers' 
</P>
<P>
But he said at one point: "Before I go on -- I want to make sure everyone in 
this room knows just where I stand, just where our Administration stands. My 
Administration is committed to reaching out to minorities, to striking down 
barriers to free and open access. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any kind -- period," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President did not announce plans to visit sub-Saharan Africa this fall, 
despite earlier speculation by White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush reiterated promises to work against poverty and racial 
intolerence, civil rights leaders attending the Urban League conference earlier 
suggested that Bush's deeds have not always matched his words. 
</P>
<P>
Before hearing directly from Bush today, several prominent civil rights 
advocates said the President's record thus far has been weak, though they 
embraced Bush's role in achieving legislation extending civil rights protection 
to disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Low Marks" 
</P>
<P>
"The civil rights community would give the President high marks for 
accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on substantive civil 
rights policy," said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership 
Conference on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders cited Bush's acceptance of Supreme Court rulings limiting 
affirmative action, his veto of minimum wage legislation and his choice of 
black Detroit lawyer William Lucas to be the Justice Department's top civil 
rights enforcer. Lucas was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 7-7 
tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that the 
President is still undecided on whether to resubmit Lucas' nomination during 
the current congressional recess -- a process that would temporarily sidestep 
the confirmation process.

there to monitor elections in February.

In a letter to Carter released today, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said: 
"We encourage you to come to Nicaragua as many times as you can during the 
electoral process, to observe all aspects of the process, and to meet with the 
members of the Supreme Electoral Council, the political parties and the 
government. You will have unrestricted access to all aspects of the process."

A fire raged out of control for three hours and gutted a dilapidated rooming 
house early today, forcing tenants to swing from ropes and leap to neighboring 
roofs because there were no exterior fire escapes. Three people were killed, 
and up to five are feared dead in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation and search for bodies was delayed while a crane was brought 
in to clear rubble of the five-story brick building. 
</P>
<P>
The city had previously filed a criminal complaint against the owner of the Ben 
Crest rooming house for failing to install a sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors said an alarm failed to sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I pulled on the fire alarm, and it broke right off in my hand," said Dwayne 
Rogers, 25, a fourth-floor resident who tried to wake other tenants before 
escaping to an adjacent roof with Leo McDonnell, 46. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a couple of people that couldn't reach the roof, and they got torched," 
Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell and Rogers said they lost one elderly man they had awakened on their 
way out. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned around and Scottie wasn't there," McDonnell said. "There wasn't 
anything more we could do."

A storm during a packed prayer service at a 10,000-seat amphitheater pelted 
participants with hail and cold rain and sent people scrambling for cover. At 
least 130 people were taken to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the injured were taken to a coronary intensive care unit, while the rest 
were treated and released Monday night, said Pat Conroy, medical coordinator 
for the five-day Lutheran national youth conference. 
</P>
<P>
Most were treated for dizziness and hypothermia, or low body temperature, from 
getting soaked by the rain, which dropped the temperature 20 degrees to about 
45.

Korean Air Lines agreed today to pay $195,000 in compensation to relatives of 
each of the 65 South Korean passengers killed when its DC-10 crashed in Libya 
last month, an airline spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the sum is made up of $130,000 in insurance payments and $65,000 in 
additional "condolence payments." KAL will also finance the education of all 
the children of the South Korean victims through college, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-10 carrying 199 people, mostly workers from South Korean firms involved 
in Libyan construction projects, crashed July 27 as the pilot tried to land in 
dense fog at Tripoli airport after a flight from Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said KAL will negotiate compensation payments for the families of 
four Korean crew members and five foreign passengers -- four Libyans and a 
Japanese -- who also died.

The chief U.S. coffee negotiator, Jon Rosenbaum, has been ousted, but the move 
does not signal a shift in U.S. coffee policy, officials at the trade 
representative's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum's departure is considered important because he took a high-profile 
approach to his job, provoking the wrath of some coffee producers for his 
outspoken ways and perceived hard-line positions. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Virgilio Barco, for example, in July blamed the 
"intransigent position" of the United States for the collapse of the coffee 
price-support system. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum will participate in a one-year career development seminar offered by 
the State Department and will not be engaged in coffee policy while taking the 
course.

FREDERICK WANG OUT AS LABS' TOP OFFICER;

<P>
Frederick A. Wang, eldest son of Wang Laboratories Inc. founder, An Wang, 
resigned as president and chief executive officer in a move the company called 
painful but necessary in its recovery from major losses, the firm announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member board of directors met at Wang headquarters Monday night in a 
special meeting, at which the younger Wang resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The board then named as acting president and CEO, Harry H. S. Chou, who is 
currently a vice chairman and director of the international computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Wang, 38, will remain on the board and undertake special projects, 
his father said in a news release today. 
</P>
<P>
A search committee for a new president was also formed. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Wang could not be reached for comment but in a prepared statement, 
he said: "I believe this action is in the best interest of Wang Laboratories at 
this time. . . . Employees and customers will be best served by a speedy 
resolution to the company's current situation." 
</P>
<P>
An Wang called his son's resignation "in keeping with his constant devotion to 
doing what he felt was in the best interest of the company." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$375-Million Quarterly Loss 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company announced a $375-million quarterly loss and suspended 
dividend payments. Its financial predicament put it in violation of a 
bank-lending agreement, the company noted. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the loss resulted from a $237-million pretax charge to cover the cost 
of a restructuring that involved closing factories, cutting jobs in its 
worldwide work force of 28,000 people, and lowering the book value of outdated 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Wang stock has lost more than 80% of its value since early 1984, when it traded 
at more than $35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Wang closed Monday at $5.75 per share, up 12 1/2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1951, the company made its reputation in the 1970s in office word 
processors. But sales began to slip with the increasing popularity of personal 
computers. Its minicomputer business fell behind as well, eclipsed by 
workstations. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, the elder Wang stepped down as president and was replaced by 
his son, a computer mathematician who had been with the company since 1972. An 
Wang on Monday returned to work part time after recovering from surgery for 
cancer of the esophagus. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Henning, a Wang spokesman, said today of the action: "We wanted to give a 
consistent message that we are doing everything and anything possible, even 
taking steps that are painful. We have a lot of work to do."

HITACHI CANCELS MICROCHIPS AD TO AVOID FANNING U.S. FRICTION

Japanese computer giant Hitachi has abandoned plans for an advertising blitz 
promoting itself as a future leader in microchips, partly due to fears of 
fanning trade friction with the United States, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi ran an advertisement for four-megabit dynamic random access memory 
chips in a July issue of industry magazine Nikkei Electronics but canceled 
plans to run it in daily newspapers and other journals. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided it was too sensational," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on a report in the daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun that the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry had advised Hitachi to give up the 
campaign. Ministry officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"In discussions (of whether to run the advertisement), some suggested it would 
irritate the U.S., where people already fear Japan is leading in technology," 
the Hitachi spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we also considered the domestic reaction. All makers are trying hard to 
move to mass production, and it was odd to have a sensational ad which didn't 
have specific content."

An international golf association has been formed to seek a place for the sport 
in the Olympics for the first time since 1904, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
An application was made in February to include golf as a demonstration sport at 
the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, but Olympic rules stipulate a sport 
must have an international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Because golf has several professional and amateur organizations but none that 
could speak for the entire sport, the World Golf Assn. was created. It has 30 
member nations. 
</P>
<P>
"For more than seven years I have been fighting for the recognition of golf as 
an Olympic sport," WGA President Claude-Roger Cartier of France said. "I hope 
that through the World Golf Association this moment has come." 
</P>
<P>
Golf was contested in the 1900 Olympics in Paris and the 1904 Games in St. 
Louis.

Former San Antonio Spurs basketball star George Gervin was arrested early today 
on charges of driving while intoxicated and possession of marijuana, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bexar County sheriff's officials said the 37-year-old former NBA All-Star was 
released this morning on a personal recognizance bond. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gervin tested only 0.03% for blood-alcohol content at the San Antonio 
Police Department and the state's definition of intoxication is 0.10%, a 
sheriff's deputy said Gervin failed a visual dexterity field test, according to 
the San Antonio Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Gervin was arrested after Deputy Chris Burchell spotted his 
black 1985 Porsche 911S weaving on Interstate 410. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gervin passed the alcohol test, Burchell reported that he refused to 
allow his blood to be tested. 
</P>
