S.D. PAROLE VIOLATORS STAY FREE UNDER COURT'S ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
JAILS: AS MANY AS 70 A WEEK WILL REMAIN ON STREETS IN MOVE TO RELIEVE THE 
SEVERE CROWDING OF COUNTY'S JAILS.

The San Diego County Sheriff, responding to a court order to reduce the number 
of inmates held in county jails, has stopped admitting as many as 70 parole 
violators each week, who before had been held in county jails before being 
transferred to state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Although law enforcement officials will try to jail parole violators considered 
a threat to the public, most of the others will remain free. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Superior Court Judge James A. Malkus ordered the county last month to 
no longer hold parole violators who in the past were jailed "as a courtesy" to 
the state Department of Corrections, Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Glenn 
Revell said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our attempt to hold our (jail) population at what the court 
has described as a constitutionally acceptable level," Revell said. "We don't 
have room or funding" to house parolees. If we had one or the other, we'd make 
adjustments. But, the way the judge's order reads, we're not legally obligated 
to take them." 
</P>
<P>
A Department of Corrections spokesman said Wednesday that local law enforcement 
officers are prohibited from transporting parole violators directly to the 
state's correctional facility in Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not feasible for local law enforcement to directly book people" at the 
Donovan Correctional Facility in Otay Mesa, the spokesman said. "It's something 
that was considered and rejected. It's a complex issue." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen on Monday ordered his officers not to make 
arrests that are based solely on warrants issued by the state Department of 
Corrections or the state Youth Authority Department. Burgreen on Wednesday 
described the situation as "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
"Parolees who are in violation of their parole from state prison and who are on 
the street cannot be booked into San Diego County jails," Burgreen said 
Wednesday. "Our officers must allow them to continue walking on the street, 
even if they have violated parole, because there is no room in jail. 
</P>
<P>
However, authorities at the city, county and state level on Wednesday 
maintained that law enforcement officers will continue to arrest dangerous 
parole violators who are a threat to society. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really going to look at (warrants) on a case-by-case basis," said John 
Dowling, a Corrections Department parole administrator whose staff oversees an 
estimated 3,800 parolees in San Diego County. "When we know that a person is 
capable of really doing some harm, we're going to get them off the street as 
soon as possible," Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials on Wednesday agreed the court order would take some 
teeth out of the parole program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something we like to see," Dowling said. "The threat (the state holds 
over parolees) is returning them to prison . . . and the first step toward that 
is usually putting them in jail and then moving them from jail to prison at a 
rapid rate. Unfortunately, we're losing that ability." 
</P>
<P>
"Now there's no serious consequence" facing many parole violators," said Revell 
of the Sheriff's Department. One East county parole officer complained to 
Revell that "we used to be holding a medicine ball over (parolees). Now we've 
got a nerf ball." 
</P>
<P>
Malkus' order means that 50 to 70 parole violators each week won't be jailed 
after warrants are issued for parole violations, Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
While state, county and local law enforcement officers will continue to arrest 
the most dangerous parolees, parolees guilty of lesser offenses won't be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests will probably not occur, for example, to parolees who fail to report to 
a parole officer, submit a "dirty" urinalysis and fail to take part in required 
occupational or social service program, Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to no longer house parole violators in county jails was the most 
recent example of how crowded jails are threatening to incapacitate the 
county's criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Malkus has issued an order requiring the county to reduce the number of inmates 
jammed into its severely crowded jails throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
The county previously had held parole violators for two working days while 
parole case workers prepared paper work needed to transfer prisoners to state 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
But in July, Malkus ruled the county was "not obligated" to house parole 
violators because they are the state's responsibility, according to Alex 
Landon, an attorney who is representing the American Civil Liberties Union in 
two court suits that generated the court order to reduce inmate populations. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's jails continue to house inmates arrested for felonies, 
most people arrested on misdemeanor charges are freed. The county, however, 
does jail people arrested on misdemeanor crimes such as domestic violence and 
some narcotics violations. 
</P>
<P>
Although crowding is a problem at county jails around the state, the Department 
of Corrections has not been forced to release inmates from state prisons 
because of crowding, Dowling said. "We're not yet in a position where we've 
been told to stop holding people," Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said jail crowding has stymied attempts to reduce crime because many 
criminals "know nothing will happen to them. We have a difficult situation . . 
. in the city with the most overcrowded jails in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The court order "is going to have an obvious impact on the morale of officers," 
said San Diego Police Department spokesman Dave Cohen. "They know certain 
people deserve to be behind bars so the judicial system can determine their 
fate." 
</P>
<P>
But, with the court order in effect, parole violators who are stopped for a 
minor traffic infraction will no longer be arrested and jailed on the parole 
warrant, Cohen said.

CHIEF DISCUSSES SHOOTINGS BY SAN DIEGO POLICE

<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen on Wednesday said preliminary results of an extensive 
internal investigation into the San Diego Police Department's use of deadly 
force do not suggest that changes in policy and procedure are in order. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen's comments on the investigation came two days after an undercover 
police officer shot and killed John Joseph Kelley, 30, while attempting to 
arrest him in the parking lot of a Mission Valley restaurant. The shooting 
marked the seventh time this year that San Diego police have shot and killed a 
suspect who was being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made no conclusions at this point as to what if anything needs to be 
done," Burgreen told members of the Citizen's Advisory Board on 
Police/Community Relations. "I want to protect our officers . . . but, at the 
same time, I want to make sure that our officers are acting appropriately in 
this critical area (of) the use of force." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said he and other top police officials are "personally participating" 
in the "time-consuming" investigation into policies and procedures that guide 
police officers in the use of deadly force. The investigation won't be 
completed until late this year, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the investigation, Burgreen and other top police officials 
will ride along with officers to determine if policies and procedures are being 
followed, or if those guidelines need to be revised. 
</P>
<P>
The officials "will actually be sitting in on classes and reviewing what is 
being taught," Burgreen said. "We will be visiting other police agencies . . . 
looking at their policies, at their training . . . and lastly, (officials) will 
be reviewing what is going on on the streets in actual practice." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen on Wednesday said a "parallel review by (the advisory board) would be 
in the public interest at this time." After the meeting, Burgreen said board 
members "have an open door . . . I think it's within their authority and 
jurisdiction . . . they have an open invitation from me . . . nothing will be 
kept from them." 
</P>
<P>
As part of its review, the Police Department is sending officers to Los 
Angeles, Dallas and Phoenix to study deadly-force policies. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen defended the use of deadly force in San Diego, which, in recent years, 
has led the nation in the number of police officers killed while on duty. 
"Eleven officers in 11 years were murdered," Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
But, although Burgreen is intent on giving his officers the right to protect 
themselves, he said the history of police killings "does not alleviate the need 
for our officers to act under appropriate policy . . . and to be held 
accountable" if policy violations are occurring. "I'm very anxious to do what 
we can to remedy some problems" that might exist, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, Burgreen will make a preliminary report to the San Diego City 
Council. Burgreen said he "will not be waiting for the whole package to make 
changes. . . . Any changes that are needed will be implemented as they are 
identified." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Burgreen on Wednesday made public a letter he sent to 
county grand jury foreman Reno J. Testolin on Aug. 2. The letter acknowledged 
that the Police Department violated its own evidence rules when officers 
improperly stored a Rolodex seized during the highly publicized investigation 
of Karen Wilkening, who, prosecutors said, ran a high-class call-girl ring out 
of a Linda Vista condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burgreen's letter defended the department's rules and procedures, he 
acknowledged that, "unfortunately, in the case in question, those guidelines 
were not followed. These policies have been restated in order to assure total 
compliance by all members of the department." The policies include proper 
management of evidence and execution of search warrants, as well as several 
management policies. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Burgreen responded to seven recommendations made by the grand 
jury in the wake of Wilkening's trial. Burgreen said he had "reviewed these 
recommendations and is in full agreement with the grand jury." The letter 
included descriptions of the department's responses, "which have been taken to 
ensure future compliance with these recommendations."

A 56-year-old catering truck operator was shot and seriously wounded Wednesday 
at a notorious Interstate 5 rest stop north of Oceanside after telling a 
would-be customer that he had no motor oil for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Harrell, a resident of Southeast San Diego who had operated the food stand 
at the popular stopping point for two months, was listed in serious condition 
late Wednesday at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. Harrell, who was 
struck by five bullets, underwent 3 1/2 hours of surgery to remove bullets from 
his chest, stomach, hip and legs. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged gunman, Eric Hazelgrove, 30, of San Diego, was captured along with 
two female companions after a high-speed chase that ended in an Orange County 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelgrove was on his way from San Diego to Los Angeles International Airport 
when he and his passengers, Jennie Wagner, 29, and her cousin, Kerry Wagner, 
21, stopped at the Aliso Creek rest area about 6:30 a.m., a spokeswoman for the 
San Diego Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Hazelgrove walked up to Harrell's catering truck and 
asked if he could purchase some motor oil. When Harrell told him that he did 
not sell oil, Hazelgrove walked back to his truck, said John Mobley, 22, the 
operator of a catering truck next to Harrell's. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, after chatting with Kerry Wagner, Hazelgrove walked back toward 
the catering truck, stopped about 20 yards away, pulled out a .22-caliber 
handgun and began firing, Mobley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching him, and he didn't even say a word," Mobley said. "It doesn't 
make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
One bullet hit Mobley's truck, narrowly missing him. "I thought I was shot 
too," he said. After Hazelgrove emptied his handgun, he walked casually back to 
his truck, jumped in and drove away, Mobley said. 
</P>
<P>
A Marine Corps military policemen stationed at the rest stop radioed to police 
in San Clemente, about 15 miles north of where the shooting occurred, to be on 
the lookout for the maroon pickup truck driven by the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente police and Orange County sheriff's deputies spotted the truck on 
I-5 and chased it to a shopping center in Mission Viejo, where the two women 
jumped out of the vehicle and tried to escape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
All three suspects were captured and taken to the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department station in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelgrove was booked at County Jail in Vista on suspicion of attempted murder, 
assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 
according to Detective Floyd Seese of the Sheriff's Department. The two women 
with Hazelgrove were questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bizarre situation," Seese said, in that there was no apparent motive 
for the shooting, although Hazelgrove told deputies that he "hated black 
people." Harrell is black. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Lee Harrell, the 14-year-old daughter of the victim, said that her father 
was employed by an Oceanside catering truck company and had been working at the 
rest stop about two months. He enjoyed the job, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told my mother that nothing like this had ever happened to him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest stop, situated in the northbound lanes of I-5 on the grounds of Camp 
Pendleton, has a history of violent incidents, including assaults and 
robberies, a Sheriff's Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug dealing and alien smuggling are among the illegal pursuits that go on at 
the rest stop, which is visited by thousands of motorists each day, she said.

JAPANESE FIRM PULLS UP STAKES AT PARADISE VALLEY CATTLE FEEDLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of legal hassles and complaints from local residents, a 
Japanese-owned cattle feedlot in Paradise Valley, near the Riverside County 
line, rounded up its last 50 calves and closed its doors for good Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With hopes to fatten, slaughter and ship high-quality black cattle to 
beef-starved and land-poor Japan, American First Beef, an Escondido-based 
company, instead was stalled by orders to stop polluting the isolated valley 
north of Warner Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, some living not more than 600 feet from the 38-acre feedlot, said 
they complained to regulatory and elected officials because they feared the 
clustering of thousands of 1,800-pound cattle in pens would bring noise, dust 
and flies to their pristine countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The state was more concerned about the potential of cattle manure contaminating 
surface and ground water, which is used by residents in Paradise Valley as 
drinking water, officials said, comparing the cattle waste to a toxic spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the permits the county told us we needed, but then the water board told 
us they would fine us for our cattle going to the bathroom on the ground," the 
feedlot's general manager Dan Winne said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, since the feedlot opened in August, 1988, the Regional Water 
Quality Control Board has threatened to impose nearly $50 million in fines, 
primarily for failing to obtain a federal waste-discharge permit. 
</P>
<P>
The company opened the ranch, one of the first of its kind in the United 
States, hoping to process 100,000 head of Black Baldie cattle a year. The goal 
was to capture a piece of the Japanese beef market when import restrictions and 
heavy tariffs on beef imports are lifted in May of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Winne said Japanese investors chose Paradise Valley for its mild weather when 
they decided to mass-produce in America, and thus sell their Kobe-style beef at 
a fraction of the cost of doing so on their small homeland island. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Wirtz, a water resource control engineer with the water board, said the 
board is still negotiating with the cattle raisers and has only imposed a 
$15,000 fine on the company for not submitting ground-water monitoring 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"They had cattle there that produced lots of manure. Our concern is that the 
manure contains nitrates that can leach down into the ground water and 
contaminate the water supply," Wirtz said. 
</P>
<P>
But Winne said American First Beef conducted a $100,000 study showing that the 
company scraped and hauled all manure off the land, and that any contaminated 
runoff water was collected in a specially designed clay-sealed pond built on 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, we were giving away the manure to farmers in the area for fertilizer, 
and they were spreading it on the ground," Winne said. "What's the difference, 
since their land is over the same ground-water basin?" 
</P>
<P>
Although the water board was also concerned about the feedlot polluting 
Temecula Creek and the San Luis Rey River, situated about 1,000 feet from the 
ranch, Winne said contaminated water never left the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been unfairly hassled so much by different agencies and tied up in 
political red tape, it just wasn't worth it anymore," Winne said. "It became 
economically infeasible for us to do business in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
He said throughout the two-year debate that the Japanese-owned company was 
discriminated against and, as the only feedlot in the county, was forced to 
comply with stringent regulations not imposed on dairies, chicken farms and 
other agricultural ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Winne said the 16 Japanese investors who opened the $8-million enterprise have 
already returned to Japan. The Escondido packing house they bought was closed 
in May, and both the feedlot and Escondido property are up for sale. Winne said 
the Japanese investors will probably lose up to $7 million on the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Although American First Beef had contracted to buy 5,000 cattle last year to 
add to its 1,287-herd, an urgency ordinance adopted by the county limited the 
feedlot to about 1,200 head of cattle, a move that Winne said was aimed at 
keeping American First Beef from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Winne, 43, who has been in the farming business since he was a boy in Imperial 
Valley, said the feedlot only slaughtered about 1,000 cattle over the past two 
years, not the 200,000 it wanted. It sold the prime beef to Japanese businesses 
for prices ranging from $8 to $100 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The beef, which is often compared to Japan's top-grade Kobe beef that sells for 
about $167 a pound, is more tender and tastier than regular American beef, 
Winne said. He said ranch workers pampered the cattle, since they weren't 
allowed to herd them with horses or yell at them. 
</P>
<P>
Winne said the cattle were even occasionally massaged. The Japanese practice of 
"gentling," or petting and soothing the cattle, is one of the secret techniques 
used to produce top-grade beef. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese also wait three to four years before slaughtering, rather than the 
American standard of 13 months to two years. The cattle were even fed a secret 
high-protein feed to bulk them up to the size the Japanese wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Winne said cheaper beef imports from Australia and America had previously 
flopped in Japan, but the Paradise Valley meat that American First Beef sold at 
premium prices appeared to satisfy the Japanese palate. 
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors complained about the concentration of animals in the 
feedlot's small pens, Winne said the Japanese had developed husbandry methods 
that reduced the noise and smell of cattle.

IP TO BE RETRIED FOR 2ND-DEGREE MURDER IN KILLING OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Sing Ip, charged with the shooting death of a Pacific Beach teen-ager, 
was ordered Wednesday to stand trial a second time. Superior Court Judge 
Herbert Exarhos set Oct. 22 as the new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
Ip, who co-owned a restaurant in Pacific Beach, was acquitted last month of 
first-degree murder in the killing of Kurt Von Yokes, 15. The jury deadlocked 7 
to 5 in favor of acquittal on second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Exarhos denied a defense motion to dismiss the murder charge against Ip and 
also kept Ip's bail at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ip remains in custody in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said Ip will be retried on a charge of 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Ip shot Yokes on July 10, 1989, after a minor traffic altercation with Yokes 
and two of the youth's friends. 
</P>
<P>
Ip admitted following Yokes and his friends, but testified that he shot the boy 
accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had a gun in his hand and was attempting to put his car in gear, to 
get away from the trio, when the vehicle stalled, causing the gun to go off. 
</P>
<P>
The gun fired once, mortally wounding Yokes in the chest.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;

<P>
CONDITIONS PUT ON PLAN TO EXPAND

A business that wants to enlarge a building in downtown Ojai should be required 
to build showers for cyclists, install 30 bicycle parking slots and contribute 
$5,000 to the Ojai Trolley, city planners say. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of a building in the Arcade district on Ojai Avenue want to add a 
second story to the former site of a gift shop and a beauty supply store. But 
because there is no vacant land nearby they can't provide parking spaces for 
the traffic that added office space would generate, Planning Director William 
Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
Planners propose that the owners also pay the city $41,000, submit an employee 
car-pool incentive plan and arrange workers' schedules so they do not 
correspond with rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions are open to public review through Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"We're agreeable to it," said Larry Wilde, an Ojai real estate broker and one 
of three partners proposing the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's time that any development in the Arcade area have some formula 
for parking because parking is a real issue," Wilde said. "We're just the new 
kid on the block to help the city create one." 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers, employees and tourists now compete for the limited number of parking 
spaces in downtown lots and along both sides of Ojai Avenue, a two-lane stretch 
of California 150 that serves as the main street through town. The 
Mission-style Arcade houses 13 shops along the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said the city modeled its conditions on a plan Santa Barbara used to 
provide parking for its new El Paseo Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an experiment with a specific project," Prince said. "But I think it's a 
step forward in the direction of a more specific parking management plan for 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
Ojai is considering requiring a standard fee for commercial developments that 
provide no adjacent parking, he said. The fees would go into a fund to develop 
more public parking lots or other programs to reduce vehicle traffic. THIA BELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHANCES OF RESCUING SEA LION SEEN AS 
IMPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County animal control officers hope to try in the next few days to rescue 
Gilly, the young California sea lion with a gill net slicing into its neck, a 
Malibu veterinarian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the chances are much better this time," said Dr. Nancy Smith, who 
organized a campaign to raise more than $4,400 to buy a net gun that she will 
donate to the county Department of Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the instrument, which costs $3,100, has been ordered and is expected 
to arrive this week. The remainder of the funds will also be donated to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Gilly first attracted widespread attention in February when a fisherman spotted 
it on a bait platform a quarter of a mile off the Malibu Pier, where the sea 
lion often rests. Rescuers have tried several times to capture it by throwing a 
net over it, but Gilly has eluded them. Experts have said that unless the 
animal is captured and the net removed, it will eventually choke to death.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY CALLS FOR CITY MEETING ON OIL 
SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, citing the crisis in the Persian Gulf, called 
Wednesday for a meeting of top city executives to discuss the possibility of an 
oil shortage. Bradley also asked city employees to voluntarily begin sharing 
rides or using mass transit to commute to and from work to save fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the possibility of an oil shortage in the wake of Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait and the resulting tumult on the international oil market that sent 
gas prices skyrocketing, Bradley called for a meeting of the city's Fuel 
Allocation Committee. No date was set for the meeting, but Bradley said it 
would convene in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel committee, formed in 1973 and comprised of the city government's top 
nine executives, has the power to determine fuel allocations among city 
departments "to ensure that no vital city services will be interrupted."

THIEF STEALS PICKUP, GETS CARGO OF CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A thief escaped with $15,000 to $30,000 Wednesday morning when he stole a 
courier service pickup that was parked at a bank. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:07 a.m., William Hanson, a driver for Heritage Courier Services, parked 
the pickup at the Bank of Commerce branch office in the 8900 block of Miramar 
Road to make a deposit for a client, according to San Diego police spokesman 
Dave Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
When Hanson left the bank at 9:12, the truck was gone, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
A bank employee spotted the truck shortly after noon a block away. The money, 
which had been in a safe fashioned from a tool box, was gone. The safe had been 
opened without force and there were no signs that the pickup's doors or 
ignition had been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said this led police to believe whoever stole the money had a key for the 
truck and knew the safe combination. In addition to the cash, the safe 
contained an undetermined number of checks. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said a witness saw a young, blond woman wearing light-colored clothing 
open the door of the truck while it was parked in the bank parking lot. Police 
have no suspects.

NEW POST OFFICE MAY OPEN IN SEPTEMBER

<P>
A new contract post office could be operating in Meiners Oaks as early as 
mid-September, postal officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The current station, operating in a television shop, will close Friday when 
owners Calvin and Caroline Rush move their business to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials in Santa Barbara decided to award a new contract station 
rather than let the Meiners Oaks operations be absorbed by the Ojai and Oak 
View post offices, spokeswoman Felice Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Howard, regional postmaster, agreed to open bids in two weeks for 
private businesses interested in picking up the contract, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract should be awarded in about six weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Rush, who has collected mail and sold stamps and money orders in 
Meiners Oaks for five years, said, "It's basically a community service you are 
doing for the people. We made a lot of friends, but it takes time away from 
your business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they decided to continue it," Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
"People were very upset around here. It was going to be a terrible 
inconvenience to a lot of people without a post office." THIA BELL

STAFF QUIT, RIVAL PAPER STARTED AS ISLANDER IS SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN M. ROSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down at Lolo Saldana's barber shop, residents of Avalon were abuzz this week 
over news that the city's longtime weekly newspaper, the Catalina Islander, had 
been sold to an out-of-state company. 
</P>
<P>
And not only that, four of the paper's five employees had quit their jobs. And 
one of them is starting up a rival paper. 
</P>
<P>
All this change has come as a surprise to the 2,500 residents of Santa Catalina 
Island, where Donald Haney's family had published the 75-year-old community 
paper since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a complete shock," said Saldana, who has been cutting hair in Avalon 
for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Haney and his wife, Ann, who edited and published the Islander together, 
announced last week that they had sold the paper to Independent News Corp., a 
Rhode Island-based company that owns a number of news weeklies and shoppers 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the town and the people," Haney said in an interview Wednesday. But, he 
added, "I'm also tired after 35 years." He said the couple had sold the paper 
for health reasons but preferred not to disclose the details. 
</P>
<P>
The Haneys, both in their late 50s, plan to move back to the mainland and look 
for a home near Bakersfield, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a day after the new owners took over operations, all but one of 
the paper's staff of five quit their jobs after being reprimanded by the 
company's president, Ted Holmberg, for leaving the business unattended during 
lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
Lenni Hill, who was the Islander's office manager, and other staff members said 
Holmberg had humiliated them. 
</P>
<P>
"(Holmberg) said, " 'You're all stupid. You don't know how to run a business,' 
" Hill recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Burke, who was a typesetter at the Islander before quitting, backed up 
Hill's account. "I've never been treated by an employer like that, and I never 
want to be again," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmberg, who works out of the company's East Coast offices, could not be 
reached for comment, but the new publisher of the Islander, Lindsay Lewis, said 
she did not recall her boss using the word "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to institute professional, business-like attitudes," Lewis said. 
"They decided that was not the way they wanted to operate and they left." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days Hill put together a small group of residents to start up 
a new paper, the Avalon Bay News. 
</P>
<P>
Hill predicted that the new paper will have more community news than the 
Islander. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in from Texas," Hill said of the Islander's new owners, "and they're 
just not our kind of people." 
</P>
<P>
The Islander's new managing editor, Julie Schoeneberg, is from Texas, where the 
company owns several newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis said the new owners realize that "we'll have to learn" about the 
island. "We don't make any presumptions that we know all about Catalina." 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of the Avalon Bay News, 24 letter-size pages, is being printed 
at Catalina Printing and is due to hit the streets today. Hill said Chuck Holt, 
the owner of the printing company, is one of four other people who worked 
around the clock this week to put out the inaugural issue. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two weeks, the new paper will be offering yearlong subscriptions 
at $22.50, undercutting the competition by $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hill and Lewis said they look forward to competition, which they said 
keeps a newspaper healthy. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the outcome, Haney said, the Islander has changed forever: 
</P>
<P>
"The days of the small newspaper have disappeared along with the small farm."

PENDLETON UNITS GOING TO MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the highest-ranking U.S. Marine said Wednesday that there are no 
immediate plans to dispatch elements of the Camp Pendleton-based 1st Marine 
Division to the Middle East in response to the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, a 
well-placed source who requested anonymity said Marines would be leaving for 
the area and may already have left. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Alfred M. Gray, commandant of the Marine Corps, speaking at a press 
conference at Camp Pendleton, said "any military option is going to require an 
integrated team effort of all of the armed forces" and added that the 1st 
Marine Division has not been placed on alert. 
</P>
<P>
But a source confirmed on Wednesday that Camp Pendleton troops would indeed be 
used in the Middle East operation. Military officials have emphasized the need 
for secrecy concerning troop deployments. 
</P>
<P>
Gray was at Camp Pendleton to attend a change-of-command ceremony. He will 
return to Washington Friday.

CUSTOM CAR SHOW CANCELED BY REDONDO'S CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: CITY OFFICIALS FEAR A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S EVENT, WHICH ATTRACTED 
SOME GANG MEMBERS. THE SPONSORING ROTARY CLUB IS SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing what they term a "gang show," Redondo Beach City Council members have 
slammed the brakes on a local Rotary Club's third annual Custom and Lowrider 
Car Show. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor, the North Redondo Beach Rotary Club, says the annual event, 
featuring hundreds of elaborate low-slung vehicles, generates thousands of 
dollars for local charities. 
</P>
<P>
But council members, citing unruliness and the presence of gang members at last 
year's show, voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to deny the club permission to stage the 
event Oct. 20 at Aviation Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Rotarian . . . but I can't in clear conscience support this event," said 
Councilman Terry Ward. "This is just opening up what we're trying to fight in 
North Redondo, and that's gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Ward remarked that the show could have included "the spray paint event and the 
drive-by shooting event." 
</P>
<P>
Such comments angered North Redondo BeachRotary Club President Tom Fouts, who 
said council members and the police officers advising them painted an overly 
threatening picture of the car show. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame the Police Department to a large degree for characterizing practically 
everyone who goes to the show as a gangster," Fouts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the council vote comes as a blow to his club. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely disappointed," Fouts said. "Last year we made about $25,000 on 
the show. That provided the resources for a vast part of our philanthropic work 
for the whole year." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's show unexpectedly attracted 600 cars -- three times the number of 
the year before -- after a car show that had been scheduled for the same day 
was canceled in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city report, alcohol was smuggled in, police officers broke up a 
number of near fights, and at one point spectators surged onto the stage and 
treated themselves to trophies and score sheets. No arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police said poor crowd control resulted in several near-misses in a car-hopping 
contest in which hydraulic suspension systems are manipulated to make vehicles 
bounce up and down. 
</P>
<P>
Gang members, they said, were at the car show in force. Said Phil Keenan, a 
detective with the city Police Department's gang unit: "We were a little bit 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Keenan told council members that an orderly car show could be held this year if 
the city staffed it with 10 uniformed officers, two members of the gang unit, 
two supervisors and five reserve officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotary Club, meanwhile, had agreed not to hold two potentially unruly 
events, bikini and macho man contests. At Mayor Brad Parton's urging, council 
members decided against a car show under any conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want this in our community," said Parton, one of several 
officials who referred to the event jokingly as a "gang show." 
</P>
<P>
Rotary Club member Phil Toomey, a Redondo Beach attorney, criticized Parton for 
painting car show enthusiasts with "too broad a brush." Parton replied: "Maybe 
it's 5% (who are gang members). But that 5% could be problems." 
</P>
<P>
Fouts noted that the first time the event was held, in 1988, it was peaceful. 
He said the only reason the crowd got out of hand at last year's show was that 
the attendance was so much larger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real problems that occurred were late in the day," Fouts said. "We 
didn't have time to get the judging done because we were only geared up to 
judge 250 to 300 cars maximum. People didn't get proper recognition and they 
got impatient." 
</P>
<P>
Fouts said the Rotary Club is trying to find an alternate site for the show but 
it is uncertain whether arrangements can be made in time. One site he said the 
club is pursuing is Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Kay Horrell said Tuesday she attended the first Custom and 
Lowrider Car Show and considered it a success. But she said police reports that 
gang members commonly show up at such events have made her reluctant to let the 
local car show continue. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason it attracted the wrong elements," Horrell said. "I'm fearful 
of these kinds of events in our community."

BOY DIES AS MIGRANTS CROSS I-5 IN THE DARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK Mc DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-year-old boy believed to have been an illegal immigrant from Mexico en 
route to family in Orange County was struck by a car and killed along 
Interstate 5 north of the San Clemente border checkpoint early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He was run down at about 12:15 a.m., as he and six others, including his mother 
and three siblings, were crossing the busy freeway in the darkness, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was identified as Constantino Loreto Marin, a resident of the Mexican 
Pacific Coast city of Acapulco. He was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
He was the 10th pedestrian believed to have been an undocumented Mexican 
citizen who has been struck and killed this year along a 10-mile stretch of 
Interstate 5 in northern San Diego County, where illegal immigrants finding 
their way north frequently cross the busy freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, 33 pedestrians believed 
to have been undocumented immigrants have suffered similar fates along 
Interstate 5 in that area. 
</P>
<P>
All of the victims apparently were trying to bypass inspection at the U.S. 
Border Patrol checkpoint along Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Undocumented immigrants heading towards the Los Angeles area from the 
U.S.-Mexico border have long attempted to walk around the giant checkpoint, 
subjecting themselves to the hazards of fast-moving freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers of undocumented people negotiating San Diego-area freeways on foot 
has increased dramatically in the past two years, U.S. officials say, 
reflecting the rising volume of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Not infrequently, authorities say, smugglers drop groups of immigrants on the 
median or shoulder of the busy freeway south of the checkpoint in Camp 
Pendleton. Arrangements are often made to rendezvous with the immigrants north 
of the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants attempting to walk around the checkpoint must often cross eight 
lanes of fast-moving traffic twice. 
</P>
<P>
Women and children are often the most vulnerable, lawmen say, because they 
cross more slowly. U.S. immigration authorities say more and more women and 
children are entering the United States illegally from Mexico, often seeking to 
reunite with husbands and fathers who have recently become legal under the 
amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"This just shows how much desperation there is out there," said Roberto 
Martinez, a rights activist in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims are from rural areas and are unaccustomed to high-speed 
freeways. In addition, they have often been traveling for hours, and are 
frequently exhausted by the time they negotiate the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has placed flashing signs along 
Interstate 5 warning motorists of the potential presence of pedestrians, but 
the deaths have continued to mount. 
</P>
<P>
The boy killed early Wednesday was believed to have been en route to the 
Anaheim-area home of relatives, according to the Mexican consul general in San 
Diego. However, his precise destination and the identity of his family members 
in the United States was not known, said Marcela Merino, a Mexican consular 
official in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He, his mother Angelica Marin, and three unidentified siblings were crossing 
from west to east when the youth was struck in the southbound lanes, according 
to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The dead boy was struck by a rented car driven by Sharon K. Frisby of Mesa, 
Ariz., according to Stephen Tomasiak, a traffic officer with the California 
Highway Patrol in Oceanside. The vehicle was traveling at about 60 m.p.h.. The 
driver was not cited, as she could not have avoided the accident, the patrol 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The group was standing in the roadway's center divider when firefighters and 
patrol officers arrived, said Gene Begnell, battalion chief with the San 
Clemente Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the last in line," said Begnell, who added that the driver, a woman, 
had attempted to avoid other pedestrians. "She couldn't miss them all." 
</P>
<P>
The site of the accident was about 2.5 miles north of the Border Patrol 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred 11 days after an undocumented Mexican couple, Ruben Calderon, 59, 
and his wife, Josefina Salgado Uriostegui, 52, were struck and killed along the 
same stretch of freeway. They were on their way to visit relatives in Orange 
County. They were killed on a spot along the freeway 1.7 miles north of where 
the boy lost his life early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Near the U.S.-Mexico boundary line, major roadways pose an even greater threat 
for illicit border-crossers. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, 83 undocumented 
pedestrians have been struck by vehicles and killed within 5 miles of the 
border while crossing three major highways -- Interstates 5 and 805 and 
California 905.

NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP FILES SUIT TO VOID PORTER RANCH APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A north San Fernando Valley neighborhood group filed suit Wednesday to void the 
Los Angeles City Council's approval of the 1,300-acre Porter Ranch project, 
saying the $2-billion development will gridlock streets, crowd schools and 
overload sewage and garbage systems. 
</P>
<P>
As unanimously approved by the council July 10, Porter Ranch would be one of 
the largest developments in the city's history, providing housing for 11,000 
people and jobs for 20,000 when built on the slopes of the Santa Susana 
Mountains north of the Simi Valley Freeway in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against the city and the 
developer, leaders of PRIDE, a neighborhood group opposed to the project, 
sought a 75% reduction in the 6 million square feet of commercial space 
approved for the project by the council. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that reduction, they vowed to seek removal from the project of 1.5 
million square feet approved for a regional shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial part of this project is way out of scale with what surrounds 
it," said PRIDE spokesman Bob Bilovsky, "and represents a triumph of developer 
dollars over the public will." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Daxon Davis, another PRIDE leader, said the group had no quarrel with the 
project's 3,395 houses and condominiums, "which we can use." She said it plans 
to focus its legal efforts on "reducing commercial space in an area that even 
now is job-rich. There already is a mile-long backup to get on the freeway in 
the evening from people who work in Chatsworth." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Clarke, a spokesman for Porter Ranch Development Co., dismissed PRIDE as a 
"small fringe group" and called the suit a "frivolous legal action" that would 
quickly be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the group's focus on the project's shopping center, Clarke said: "That 
has to raise questions about who is financially behind this group." Clarke and 
other development officials have repeatedly suggested -- without evidence, they 
admit -- that project opponents might represent other Valley malls seeking to 
head off competition. 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE leaders heatedly reject such accusations, saying that they are fighting 
the proposed mall because it would be a major generator of traffic that would 
clog streets and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area, contends that the $50 million 
in traffic improvements the developers would be required to pay for will make 
neighborhood streets "better than they are now." 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE leaders also said they were heartened by the outcome of negotiations 
Tuesday between Bernson and the Simi Valley City Council, even though the talks 
resulted in a decision by the council not to file suit to block the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley council members said they decided not to go to court after Bernson 
agreed to amend the project plan to prohibit construction of more than 1.5 
million square feet of commercial and retail space until the state has begun 
work on widening the Simi Valley Freeway to eight lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Bernson and the developer "capitulated so quickly just proves 
that the environmental documents prepared to justify this project are shaky," 
said PRIDE board member Don Worsham. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached with the Simi council "contained no concessions 
whatsoever," Clarke said. "We merely agreed to clarify a provision that already 
was in the plan in order to ease their worries."

NEIGHBORS OF POND BUGGED BY MOSQUITOES; 
</P>
<P>
PESTS: A RECENT APPLICATION OF INSECTICIDE HAS BROUGHT SOME RELIEF. NOW 
OFFICIALS ARE STUDYING LOWERING THE WATER LEVEL TO FURTHER REDUCE THE HAZARD. 
</P>

<P>
The orange and blue can of insect repellent stood alone on a shelf in the 
Chatsworth Lake Market, a monument to a potentially perilous problem along the 
shores of the Chatsworth Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is mosquitoes. Swarms of the pesky insects have transformed the 
two-acre reservoir from a bucolic pond into a buzzing nightmare. Nearby 
residents, fearful of mosquito attacks, said they have been cloistered behind 
closed doors most of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"You literally could not go outside at night," resident Christina Stroh said as 
she played Wednesday with her 21-month-old daughter in their back yard. "It was 
that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Residents said a recent insecticide application, the result of numerous angry 
calls to state officials, appears to have killed off the worst of the 
infestation. They hope that a decision this week by the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power to lower the reservoir's water level will further reduce the 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh and others with small children have been particularly worried because the 
mosquitoes swarming around their houses could be carrying the potentially fatal 
St. Louis encephalitis virus, which causes inflammation of the brain and spinal 
chord. Symptoms can range from flulike conditions to more rare manifestations, 
including paralysis, coma and even death. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Southeast Mosquito Abatement District mailed about 700 
trapped mosquitoes packed in dry ice to a state laboratory in Berkeley, where 
they will be tested for the virus, said Jacquie Spoehel, an entomological 
assistant with the district. 
</P>
<P>
Although one mosquito with the virus was trapped in June in the Sepulveda 
Basin, no diseased insects have been found near the Chatsworth Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the DWP unsuccessfully tried to bring in equipment to lower the 
pond's water level. Spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said the DWP must clear an 
access road to make room for the oversized pump truck. 
</P>
<P>
DWP workers will also chop down tall tule brushes along the shore that provide 
an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
The actions come none too soon for those living nearby in new tract houses on 
winding streets. 
</P>
<P>
"A month ago, it was really bad," said Gabrielle Vanderpool, who said she 
suffered from painful dime-sized welts on her arms. "You couldn't go outside 
without getting attacked. Even inside the house, we had to lock ourselves in 
our bedrooms." 
</P>
<P>
The insects were especially menacing to Norma Ortiz, whose two young children 
are allergic to their bites. "If we came outside, we'd all be wrapped in 
towels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a woman at the market carried a baby girl covered with mosquito 
bites, store manager Denise Gentile said. "The poor kid looked like she had the 
measles," Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents who recently moved to the area said they would have moved 
elsewhere had they known about the infestation. Some have coped by hoarding bug 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep it under the barbecue and everywhere," Oriz said. "That's the first 
thing guests say -- 'Where's the Off?' " 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Jeff Adams, have adopted more creative defensive techniques. On 
a friend's recommendation, Adams swallows Vitamin B daily. "It's just something 
in your blood that gives off this scent and they don't go near you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The infestation is acute this year because silt from surrounding construction 
sites has raised the water level to the leaves of the tule bushes. Fish, which 
normally control the mosquito population, cannot easily snap up insects that 
settle on the leaves.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;

<P>
CITY ACCUSED OF HINDERING SHELTER

<P>
Joining a controversy surrounding the county's only year-round homeless 
shelter, Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn on Wednesday accused the city of 
Oxnard of trying to undermine the Zoe Christian Center. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, representatives of the center maintained that city officials are 
trying to close the homeless shelter while working to develop their own 
city-run shelter. 
</P>
<P>
He said Oxnard city officials were trying to undermine the Zoe Center. "I can't 
give you any names, but I've talked to sources inside the city administration 
and with council members, and I've heard that," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials deny the allegation but acknowledge that they have proposed a 
joint-powers agreement with the Assn. of Ventura County Cities to develop and 
operate a homeless shelter in Oxnard. The association is studying the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, whose district includes Oxnard, also urged the City Council to issue a 
land-use permit to allow the center to continue operating at its current site. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have refused to renew a land-use permit that expired last year 
because they say the center is too close to a fertilizer company where toxic 
chemicals are stored. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be concerned if it were unsafe," Flynn said, "but I've visited the site, 
and the city's health concerns are just an excuse" to deny Zoe a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
During a City Council meeting Tuesday, Zoe supporters produced an internal memo 
by a senior city planner in Thousand Oaks stating that financial support of the 
Zoe Center "may be a political liability" for the city in its dealings with 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Housing Director Sal Gonzalez said the memo is inaccurate. SANTIAGO

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERIM CITY MANAGER NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Huntington Beach City Manager Charles Thompson has been appointed 
interim city manager of Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 62, will replace James Arnold, who was ousted last month shortly 
after he pleaded not guilty to 17 misdemeanor charges stemming from the 
demolition of three city buildings containing asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who will serve as the city's fourth manager in less than three years, 
was appointed to the job Monday with the unanimous support of the council. 
</P>
<P>
He will start next Monday and is expected to continue in the position until 
Dec. 1. He will be paid $6,000 a month plus an estimated $9,000 in overtime and 
expenses for helping to recruit a permanent city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has about 35 years of experience in city management, was 
Huntington Beach's city manager from 1981 to October, 1987, before he retired 
to work on his own consulting business. Previously, he was Downey's city 
manager from 1970 to 1981. He lives in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carol Norman, a critic of Arnold, described Thompson as a 
professional who "has a reputation for being strong, but fair" and who is noted 
for being a "good, take-charge type of a person." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Harold Hofmann, who cast the sole vote against removing Arnold, also 
expressed confidence in Thompson. "He is a knowledgeable city manager, has a 
lot of experience, and comes to us with good credentials," Hofmann said. "I am 
very impressed with him."

PLANNERS VOICE CONCERNS OVER INDUSTRIAL PARK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planning commissioners said Wednesday that they are 
concerned about noise and traffic which could be created by a proposed 
industrial park near Castaic and told the project's developer to work with 
nearby residents to resolve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Newhall Land and Farming Co., said it was willing to redesign 
portions of the project to reduce noise and traffic, but some homeowners living 
near the site said they doubted that the company would address all of their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not trying to resolve the problems the community has brought up," said 
Lester Freeman, president of the Live Oak Community Assn., after a 2 1/2-hour 
hearing before the Regional Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the Valencia Commerce Center, an industrial park that would be 
built on 1,436 acres west of the Golden State Freeway and north of California 
126 in the Santa Clarita Valley. The park would provide 12 million square feet 
of office and manufacturing space. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 residents of Live Oak and adjoining housing tracts attended 
Wednesday's hearing. Their leaders told the planning commissioners that the 
park, as proposed, would destroy the quality of life in the area. The residents 
made unemotional, often technical comments about the project's design and 
introduced aerial photographs to make their points. 
</P>
<P>
They charged that parts of the environmental impact report on the project were 
based on faulty data. "It puts economic gain before the health and safety of 
the community at this time," Marcella Tyler Ketelhut said of the report. 
</P>
<P>
But Ketelhut said the residents were willing to work with Newhall Land to 
develop a safe industrial park. "We're not seeking a complete stop to this 
project," Ketelhut said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Clinton C. Ternstrom, who represents the Santa Clarita Valley, 
said he shared the concerns of residents about heavy traffic entering the park 
via Backer Road, which passes directly behind a residential street that is 
northeast of the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
Ternstrom said Newhall Land will have to prove that the noise and traffic 
problems can be controlled. "I'm going to press this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land officials will meet with residents to discuss the latest 
modifications to the park plan. The commission scheduled another public hearing 
on the industrial park Oct. 25.

3-CITY GROUP BEGINS TRAFFIC STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTING: A FRUSTRATED COALITION IS DRIVEN TO SEEK ITS OWN ANSWERS FOR 
CONGESTION IN DOWNTOWN GLENDALE, PASADENA AND BURBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank representatives, feeling ignored 
by a Los Angeles-oriented traffic bureaucracy, has launched a $150,000 study to 
explore suburb-to-suburb commuting among the three cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get rid of congestion in downtown Glendale, downtown Burbank 
and downtown Pasadena," said Glendale City Councilman Carl W. Raggio, chairman 
of the Tri-City Transportation Coalition, which is overseeing the study. 
</P>
<P>
"The freeways are inadequate and filled to capacity," Raggio said. "You've got 
to have alternative ways of moving people." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition board member David Barnhart, Pasadena's city engineer and 
transportation manager, added: "The jobs-housing balance is not an academic 
concept anymore. The suburb-to-suburb commute is just exploding." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of this, he said, traffic on the Foothill Freeway through the San 
Gabriel Valley has increased by 27% during the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-City Transportation Coalition was formed last year by business, 
government and community leaders who thought that regional and state 
transportation agencies had ignored their collective needs. 
</P>
<P>
Banding together last September after a series of transportation seminars 
sponsored by chambers of commerce from the three cities, the coalition took its 
complaints to the transportation agencies' planners. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the Southern California Assn. of Governments is contributing 
$100,000 and the Southern California Rapid Transit District is paying for the 
rest of the one-year study. It will analyze everything from Dial-A-Ride 
programs to commuter buses, light rail, commuter trains, car-pool lanes and 
trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation, the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission and the staffs of the three cities will also be involved. 
</P>
<P>
The multiagency study team will come up with a report meant to be used as a 
lobbying tool to gain funding for transportation projects benefiting the three 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Tri-City wants this to be the most comprehensive look ever at east-west 
transportation in the corridor," coalition spokesman Nat Read said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the problem, coalition members cite the planning for commuter 
rail and light-rail trains in Los Angeles County and say it has failed to 
adequately consider transportation connections in the three cities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a proposed Pasadena-to-Los Angeles light rail would do little to 
help commuters in Burbank and Glendale, they say. 
</P>
<P>
And a proposed commuter train from Moorpark to downtown Los Angeles is to make 
stops in Burbank and Glendale. But, Raggio asked, how would someone use that 
train route and get to work in Pasadena? 
</P>
<P>
Much of the transportation planning in the 1960s and 1970s, Raggio said, 
considered downtown Los Angeles as the hub of the county and ignored how the 
spokes might connect. 
</P>
<P>
"Once," Raggio said, "you worked in L.A. and you lived in the suburbs. But the 
suburbs have become more and more commercial and retail. And they've become 
work centers." High-rise office buildings, he said, have sprouted above the 
landscapes of the three cities and draw commuters daily from throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The cities might have received more attention earlier from the traffic 
bureaucracies had they banded together sooner, said project manager Bijan 
Yarjani of the transportation department of the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "I'm not sure they have been neglected. But the level of 
congestion has not been as great there as probably some other places in L.A. 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Yarjani is scheduled to brief the coalition on the progress of the study today 
in Pasadena during the group's monthly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
One idea being considered is a proposal to solve the cities' traffic woes with 
a tri-city trolley system linked by buses. Raggio and a number of other 
coalition members favor the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The study also will determine "where people are coming from, where are they 
going, and how many are just passing through," Yarjani said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the amount of funding involved, we can't look at everything in depth," 
Yarjani said. But he said the problem can be quantified and decisions made on 
"what is the quickest, short-term way to solve the problem without spending a 
lot of money."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY DIES AFTER BEING EJECTED FROM CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy was ejected from a car and killed Wednesday when the vehicle, 
driven by his father, veered out of control and overturned on Soledad Canyon 
Road near Agua Dulce, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said Michael Sylvia of Canoga Park died at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia shortly after the 5 a.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
Officer A. J. Torres said the boy's father, Walter G. Sylvia, was driving south 
on Soledad Canyon Road about four miles north of Agua Dulce Canyon Road when 
the car drifted off the road. The car overturned as he attempted to steer it 
back onto the road. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia suffered minor injuries. The accident is under investigation.

VENTURA REDUCES JULY WATER USE BY 22.8% IN 3RD MONTH OF LIMITS 
</P>

<P>
The city of Ventura has cut water use by 5 million gallons per day during July 
compared to the same month last year, city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, those same statistics show a slight decrease in conservation compared 
to last month. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said this happened because the city's water conservation ordinance 
allows more usage in some cases during July, August and September. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to last year, Ventura reduced its water use 22.8% in July, the third 
month since water conservation became mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Venturans consumed 1,825 acre-feet of water, down from 2,365 acre-feet in July, 
1989, said Carol Green, a spokeswoman for the city's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
One acre-foot of water equals 325,851.43 gallons and typically takes care of 
the yearly needs of a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
But Venturans saved less water last month than they did in June, when the city 
used 1,621 acre-feet, compared to 2,195 acre-feet in June, 1989 -- a saving of 
26.1%. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they are not concerned with the small increase in water 
consumption and are optimistic that Ventura will soon reach its goal of a 30% 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the hottest summer in 25 years, so even though we haven't 
reached our goal yet, we are moving in the right direction," said Vice Mayor 
Donald Villeneuve, chairman of the city's water subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Green noted that based on historical use, July, August and September have the 
highest use and are the months in which the city allocates additional water to 
customers who show a need. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore people have more water to use during these months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the state Drought Center in Sacramento commended Ventura for its 
efforts and encouraged its residents to try to do even better. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura's doing fine, obviously, but the city would do well in bringing the 
water conservation program to everybody's attention once again," said George 
Deatherage, a Drought Center spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like people are losing interest and the city is slipping away from 
its goal." 
</P>
<P>
He cited July statistics from other water conservation programs around the 
state that might inspire Venturans. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara has a mandatory program aimed at cutting water use by 45%, for 
example, and has achieved a 47% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, whose goal is a 20% reduction, cut water use by 26%. 
</P>
<P>
And the Monterey Peninsula Municipal Water District, shooting for at least a 
20% reduction, cut consumption by 30%.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL DROPS UTILITY TAX MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council this week dropped plans to place a proposed utility 
tax on the November ballot but postponed a decision on budget cuts to offset 
the unexpected loss of $91,000 in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week ordered city staff to draw up the text of the measure, 
which would have imposed a 2% tax on residents and businesses and generated 
$240,000 a year for the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
But during a budget hearing Monday, after questions were raised about whether 
seniors and low-income residents should be exempt from the tax, the measure's 
two strongest advocates withdrew their support. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Harold Hofmann said he withdrew his support for the tax because the 
council had run out of time to revise the measure before the election. But he 
added: "I'd almost say for sure we're going to see it on the June ballot." 
</P>
<P>
The council delayed voting on its $7.8-million budget last week after learning 
that the state is cutting back on a year-old program designed to give 
additional funds to cities that get little or no revenue from property taxes 
collected within their borders. City officials expected to receive $163,000 
from the program this year, but they were notified last week that they can 
count on only about $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although no decision on the budget was reached Monday night, the council 
discussed cutting some programs, travel expenses and as many as four City Hall 
positions to make up for the shortfall. The council's next budget workshop is 
set for Monday.

SANTEE, COUNTY TAKE THEIR BATTLE OVER TEMPORARY JAIL TO LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE 
</P>

<P>
Bad blood between San Diego governmental officials boiled over Wednesday during 
a legislative committee hearing on whether the state should intervene in the 
controversy surrounding the temporary men's jail in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
The East County municipality wants lawmakers to step in and force San Diego 
County officials to the negotiating table to haggle over a date when the 
temporary 600-bed facility will be shut down and moved out of town. 
</P>
<P>
The county is crying foul, accusing Santee of trying to use the Legislature as 
an unnecessary cudgel in a local dispute. 
</P>
<P>
As of late Wednesday night, lawmakers had yet to decide whether to step into 
what one of them called a "cat fight." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a bill sponsored by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) that would force 
officials from the county and Santee to enter into "voluntary" mediation and 
come up with an agreement by February for the dismantling of the temporary 
jail, which was built next to the Los Colinas Women's Detention Facility to 
house an overflowing prison population. Originally, county officials said the 
jail would be removed by 1996. But, with plans going slowly for permanent 
replacements elsewhere, Santee residents are afraid the county will want to 
push back that date or renege on the pledge altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Bob J. Wilson, one-time state senator representing Santee and now a Sacramento 
lobbyist, testified that the city is anxious to get rid of the men's facility. 
The county has concentrated 28% of its prison population into one of its 
smallest cities, and the jail is only 500 feet from private residences and two 
blocks from an elementary school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the jail was erected last year, there have been four escapes, a 
20-prisoner riot and an influx of prison visitors and drug dealers in the area, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Santee is one of the less glamorous places in the county," said Killea, 
explaining why there may not be enough local sympathy to uproot the temporary 
facility. "It's not the beautiful, affluent North County . . . and the county 
comes along and slaps it in the face." 
</P>
<P>
"We're telling them you have to voluntarily get together," Killea said about 
the bill. "It's a slight contradiction, but it is saying you have to sit at the 
table and work this out." 
</P>
<P>
But County Supervisor Brian Bilbray told the panel that passing the bill would 
be "immoral," since it favors Santee over other cities with jails -- such as 
Vista and Chula Vista. He said the county cannot commit on a date to get out of 
Santee because it is negotiating to build permanent replacement jails in 
Clairemont Mesa and East Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Pandora's box you don't want to open," an animated Bilbray warned 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said later that lawmakers should stay out of local disputes, especially 
since county officials are willing to stick their necks out and make some 
unpopular decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"If Sacramento is going to get involved in this, then why don't they site the 
jails? Why don't they site the landfills? Then the local officials don't have 
to take the heat."

2 ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: A LANCASTER COUPLE ARE CHARGED WITH WITHHOLDING $170,000 IN WAGES ON TWO 
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Lancaster electrical contractor and his wife were charged Wednesday with 
misappropriating about $170,000 in wages from their employees on two public 
works projects by paying illegally low wages to workers and falsifying 
government records. 
</P>
<P>
In what prosecutors described as rare criminal charges for such an offense, 
James and Brenda Paxin were charged with defrauding employees during 
subcontracting work at Lancaster City Hall and Canyon Country Park in Santa 
Clarita during 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-count complaint against the Paxins, co-owners of Paxin Electric, was 
filed by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office in Lancaster based 
on a nine-month inquiry by state labor investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities charged the Paxins with violating state labor laws against 
diverting wages due to workers. James Paxin, 38, was also charged with 
falsifying public documents submitted to city and state officials. He allegedly 
forced workers to report that they worked fewer hours and received higher pay 
than they actually had to make it appear that they received the prevailing wage 
required on government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen workers were allegedly victimized on the $4.7-million City Hall 
addition from February, 1988, to July, 1989. Paxin received a $560,000 contract 
and illegally pocketed about $116,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen employees were victimized on the $2.1-million park project, where 
Paxin Electric performed $158,000 in wiring work as a subcontractor between May 
and November, 1989, authorities said. The Paxins allegedly pocketed $53,000 on 
that project. 
</P>
<P>
Paxin and his wife, 40, surrendered in Antelope Valley Municipal Court on 
Wednesday and were released on their own recognizance. Attorney Michael C. 
Eberhardt, who appeared for the couple, said he knew little about the case. 
</P>
<P>
But Eberhardt said: "Normally these cases are handled civilly. I have to see 
why this case was taken to the criminal level." 
</P>
<P>
Only about four or five such criminal cases are filed in Southern California 
each year, said Roger Miller, regional manager of the enforcement bureau of the 
state Division of Labor Standards. He said investigators filed charges against 
the Paxins because the couple had been the subject of civil actions in the past 
for similar violations and because employees came forward with testimony and 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The Paxins' scheme enabled them to circumvent established competitive bidding 
procedures for government contracts, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the intent of the law, to make the process competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are receiving an increasing number of complaints about 
employers who misappropriate public works funds by demanding kickbacks from 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers filed Wednesday, an investigator said Paxin "developed an 
elaborate paper scheme to avoid proper payment of prevailing wages to his 
employees." Workers were paid between $5 and $15 an hour for work that should 
have earned $29.60 an hour under state-mandated wages for electricians, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers signed altered pay sheets because they "feared for their jobs if they 
did not go along with the program," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 21 felony counts carries a penalty of 16 months to three years in 
prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Division of Labor Standards is pursuing civil action that could also result 
in fines, officials said.

MEASURES WON'T BE ON REDONDO'S NOVEMBER BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poised to place a series of ballot questions before city voters Nov. 6, the 
Redondo Beach City Council suddenly backed down Tuesday night, deciding in a 
surprise move to table the measures. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted 4 to 0 to shelve ballot questions on issues ranging from 
term limits for elected officials to campaign reform to the size of the city's 
library commission. 
</P>
<P>
The council could still decide to put some or all of the measures on the 
municipal ballot next March, however. 
</P>
<P>
A key factor in Tuesday's vote was a change of heart on a competing pair of 
measures affecting term limits. One would remove an existing City Charter 
provision prohibiting council members and the mayor from serving more than two 
four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
The other would broaden the two-term limit so it applies not only to the 
mayoral and council posts, but also to the city's other elective offices: city 
treasurer, city clerk and city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ward, one of three council members who voted last month to place the term 
limit questions on the ballot, said he backtracked because he did not want to 
risk extending the two-term limit to the city's treasurer, clerk and attorney. 
Those posts, he said, require long experience and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Cawdrey, chief backer of the measure to abolish the two-term 
limit, indicated that he changed his mind on the need for a referendum because 
he may challenge the term restriction in court instead.

In reading the remarks of Fein and Meese I did not know whether to laugh or 
cry. My God, they're serious! 
</P>
<P>
If it prevents us from making money, drive it into extinction. If we do not 
immediately recognize some pragmatic benefit to ourselves, let it slip into 
oblivion. Put it in a zoo! We've got lumber to cut! 
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of their second paragraph they reveal why they hold the 
environment and all "lesser species" in such disdain. They equate "economic 
growth with human well-being." Can't breathe? Stay indoors and turn on a fan. 
Can't drink the water? Have a beer. Fein and Meese ask who needs spotted owls, 
and what is so important about red squirrels? What anemic thinking! What a 
display of impoverishment of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1968 I have been a Republican. In June I registered as a Democrat. As 
environmental spokesmen for the Bush Administration, Meese and Fein offer two 
of the clearest reasons why I have done so.

REDEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a resident of South Los Angeles, I think that the Watts redevelopment plan 
is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if they build new businesses, there will be more jobs for people. 
</P>
<P>
However, what about our homes? What if we don't want to sell our houses? I 
think that government should just buy from the people who are willing to sell 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
I think that in order to improve this community, the government should give 
more jobs to people. That's why there are a lot of drug dealers on the streets 
of Los Angeles. Finally, I think that government should build more recreation 
areas for youths.

<P>
The commentary was correct in that we are endangering the human race; not, 
however, for the reasons stated. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that the preservation of wildlife means the loss of jobs, 
these same jobs are endangered by limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
The extinction of any species, even one as seemingly inconsequential as the 
snail darter, has drastic effects on the area it habitats. In short, it causes 
a chain reaction which upsets the natural balance of things. In the long run, 
this hurts the human race much more than a higher unemployment rate could.

Fein and Meese espouse the usual conservative rhetoric; namely that development 
is good and preservation is bad. While arguing for change in the Endangered 
Species Act to promote human welfare above the welfare of lesser species, they 
view the issue from a short-term perspective, while asserting man's dominion 
over nature. 
</P>
<P>
If jobs are preserved, rather than the northern spotted owl, what happens to 
jobs once the old-growth forests are depleted? For that matter, if the 
California coastline is opened up for oil exploration, what happens once the 
relatively short-term supplies of oil are gone? This is the same intellectual 
hocus-pocus that brought us nuclear energy without any concern about long-term 
waste disposal (a problem we are no closer to solving than 10 years ago). 
</P>
<P>
More and more citizens are now realizing that there is intrinsic, 
unquantifiable value to nature undisturbed. If we follow the lead of these two 
"scholars," it stands to reason that nothing short of our national parks will 
be preserved, leaving society as a whole environmentally impoverished as a 
result.

CERULLO TO MOVE SAN DIEGO MINISTRY TO EX-PTL 'HERITAGE USA' PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morris Cerullo, the San Diego-based evangelist who is buying the Christian 
theme park Jim Bakker built in Ft. Mill, S.C., said Wednesday that he plans to 
move his entire ministry to the site by the middle of next year, when the park 
is scheduled to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo estimated that his operations in San Diego employ 150 full- and 
part-time staffers, but he said plans for relocation had not been discussed 
with them yet. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 2,200-acre "New Heritage USA" site, which Jim Bakker built up as 
the cornerstone of the now defunct PTL Club, "will be a clean, wholesome 
atmosphere" and operated strictly as a business and kept separate from the 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to continue to take the lead in running the ministry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo said his son David will run the ministry's TV network, which will 
broadcast over the former PTL satellite network. Cerullo has put $7 million 
into escrow to buy the network but is still awaiting approval from the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's press conference, Cerullo introduced three men who will help him 
run Heritage USA. One, Bill Lund, worked for Walt Disney in the initial stages 
of developing both Walt Disney World and Epcot Center. Lund is a trustee of 
Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Also working with Cerullo will be Hal Tysinger, a North Carolina native who 
specializes in rejuvenating slumping real estate developments, and Dennis 
Kohan, who has more than 25 years experience in financial management. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding for New Heritage USA has been committed by established financial 
institutions here in the United States," said Cerullo, who didn't specify which 
banks. Cerullo has until Nov. 2 to find $45 million needed to finance the theme 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The money will go to pay off the secured creditors owed money by PTL (which 
stands for Praise The Lord). 
</P>
<P>
Alan Elias, a Cerullo spokesman, said a "package of benefits" will also be 
arranged for those who purchased "lifetime partnerships" from PTL while it was 
run by Jim Bakker, now serving a 45-year prison term in Minnesota for fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Elias also said the buying of Heritage USA is the culmination of two years of 
planning and research into the purchase.

WE LET THE GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE;

<P>
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION DON'T REQUIRE HIGH TECHNOLOGY, SOMETHING U.S. 
TROOPS MAY FIND OUT SOON.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER D. ZIMMERMAN, Physicist Peter D. Zimmerman is distinguished visiting 
professor of engineering and applied science at George Washington University 
and a former technical adviser to the U.S. strategic arms reduction talks 
delegation. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If U.S. troops now on their way to the Middle East go into combat against 
Iraq's army, the Americans and their allies may find themselves poorly equipped 
for the task at hand and insufficiently trained for it. The reasons can be 
traced to our own critical policy errors. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s onward, U.S. forces were shaped to fight the least probable but 
most destructive of wars, an exchange of strategic missiles between the United 
States and the Soviet Union. The likelihood of intercontinental nuclear war was 
never high, but an obsession with nuclear strategy diverted analysts and 
planners from less destructive -- but enormously more probable -- conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of strategic nuclear war siphoned money into such programs as 
mobile ICBMs and the Strategic Defense Initiative "research" effort, which have 
cost billions that could have gone into better training, more strategic airlift 
capability, better light tanks, and far more effective tank-killer weapons. The 
B-2 bomber has consumed $20 billion since its inception. American forces may go 
into battle distinctly less ready than we would wish because we have made the 
wrong investments. 
</P>
<P>
Our troops also will be at a disadvantage from another direction, particularly 
in facing Iraq. American policy has for decades been to limit the spread of 
nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and long-range missiles. But this policy 
focused on the wrong targets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade and export diplomacy has tried to confine the spread of modern 
technology, as if there were some magic high-tech ingredients that were the 
keys to weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. 
Non-proliferation specialists carefully tracked the movement of krytrons -- 
switches useful in triggering some kinds of nuclear weapons, but unnecessary 
for others. No krytrons fired the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, diplomacy has tried to restrain the movement of gas centrifuges to 
produce bomb-grade uranium. But there are other ways to produce enriched 
uranium using technology that has been on the world market for at least two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Preventing the spread of long-range missiles has been another U.S. goal, as if 
large rockets could not be developed indigenously throughout the world. A 
Pentagon official once remarked that the Pershing II missile had a quarter of a 
million parts, every one of which had to work; he asked if a developing country 
could duplicate that missile. Certainly not; but he posed the wrong question. 
</P>
<P>
The German V-2 has perhaps one-tenth as many parts and was built in 1944 and 
1945 by slave labor in the horrendous conditions of the "Mittelwerk" 
underground factory. It deliveredone ton of high explosive at a range of 200 
miles. The V-2 even used recycled pots and pans for its thrust chamber because 
Germany had no better steels. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed plans for long-range rockets, foreign and American, are available in 
open archives. 
</P>
<P>
During the long war with Iran, Iraqi engineers cobbled together Soviet-supplied 
SCUD missiles to develop a new rocket with twice the range and twice the 
payload -- and did it without aid from the industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
And, most immediately threatening, there were reports Wednesday of Iraqis 
loading chemical weapons on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein has already used chemical weapons against both Iran and his own 
rebellious Kurdish citizens. The gases used ranged from 1940s-type nerve gases 
to simple cyanide and mustard gases, often in combination. If he chooses to use 
chemical weapons against American or Saudi forces, he can do so. He can, at the 
very least, force our troops to fight inside chemical-protection suits (so hot 
that they are barely tolerable in northern European weather) on a desert 
battlefield in August. Water, the mainstay of decontamination procedures, will 
be scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq probably lacks nuclear weapons, but it does have weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
We could have taken strong diplomatic steps to make possession of long-range 
missiles and chemical weapons internationally unacceptable and undesirable, but 
we did not. Economic sanctions could have been sought when Iraq violated 
international norms using against chemical weapons, and Western nations could 
have offered solid security guarantees to any state attacked with weapons of 
mass destruction. But we relied instead on technical controls; and in this, as 
in so many of today's problems, there is no purely technical fix. Chemical 
weapons, missiles, and even nuclear weapons can all be built or acquired by a 
determined nation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945 we thought the Soviets would take 20 years to build an atomic bomb; 
they took four. Again in Iraq we underestimated the intelligence and 
resourcefulness of our potential adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps international diplomatic efforts to stop the proliferation of the worst 
weapons have a chance in the world of today, with cooperation among nations 
emerging on an unprecedented scale. But for now the genie has escaped and is in 
Iraqi hands, ready to be used. 
</P>
<P>
There are unclassified satellite pictures of an area near Baghdad called Salman 
Pak. Those pictures contain persuasive indications that Saddam Hussein has, or 
will soon have, a powerful biological weapons factory using germ and virus 
cultures supplied unwittingly by, among others, the American Centers for 
Disease Control and European and Soviet laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
American options in Iraq are restricted, and our actions may be deterred, by 
Iraqi missiles carrying chemical, and perhaps biological, weapons. But it is 
our own fault.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucille Olsen Gaenger, a retired traffic coordinator who was active with the 
Mormon church, has died in West Hills. She was 83. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gaenger died Sunday of a stroke, said her son, Rowan Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, she moved from her native Utah to Los Angeles, where she coordinated 
deliveries at the Pillsbury Co., where she worked until her retirement in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gaenger was active in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 
70 years. She was also a charter member of a women's musical group called 
Sempre Musica and served as its president in 1944 and 1945. During the late 
1940s and early 1950s, she was a member and conductor of the Turnberin Women's 
Chorus, which performed its material in German. She also was president during 
the 1950s of the Women's L. A. Traffic Club, a group of women working in 
businesses related to transportation. She lived in Woodland Hills for 15 years 
before moving to a convalescent home in West Hills two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her son, eight grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service was held Wednesday. Pierce Brothers Praiswater Mortuary in

<P>
Up steps Austin Tolliver with a puzzled look on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad," he says, staring with wide eyes at Billy Joe, the man who will start at 
quarterback for the Chargers this season. "Where did Dave Archer go?" 
</P>
<P>
Tough question. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Archer's gone, buddy," Billy Joe explains. "He's home." 
</P>
<P>
And there, at the tender age of 2, Austin Tolliver received a brief lesson in 
what this business of quarterbacking in the NFL is all about. One day, Austin 
was playing with one of his dad's colleagues after practice. The next, David 
Archer was nowhere to be found, a victim of an early roster trim. 
</P>
<P>
Charger quarterbacks have come and gone quite frequently since Dan Fouts moved 
up to the broadcast booth following the 1987 season. For more than a decade, 
Fouts was the Chargers' solution to the leakiest defense in the NFL. These 
days, the defense is just fine, but nobody is too sure about the quarterbacks. 
Tolliver, Mark Vlasic and rookie John Friesz are all fodder for the skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
The big responsibility this season has been dumped into the lap of Tolliver, 
who started five games last year as an enthusiastic but unpolished rookie. He 
did everything a talented first-year player is supposed to do. He threw 
interceptions, made bad decisions and occasionally showed hints of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning says Tolliver has made good progress since last 
season, but it hasn't yet been evident on the field. In Saturday's scrimmage 
against the Phoenix Cardinals, Tolliver threw two interceptions. Usually 
friendly and open to questions, Tolliver was terse with reporters afterward, 
answering with a lot of yesses and nos. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure is there. Billy Joe Tolliver knows it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some pressure, because they're trying to hang their hat on me, and 
I'm trying to show them that I'm worthy of that honor," he says. "You know, I'd 
like to think I showed them a couple of flashes last year of what I could do, 
and that's part of the reason they're going this route." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver is very aware of his limitations and isn't getting too full of 
himself. Sure, more people are asking for his autograph these days, and there 
are more interview requests. People even recognize him on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Tolliver says. "But it's not John Elway. I've gone a few places with 
John in the off-season, and it's just incredible. The guy can't have a peaceful 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
For someone with confidence in his abilities as a football player, Tolliver 
isn't much for selling himself as a worldly, interesting guy. He figures he'll 
let Burt Grossman say the funny stuff and just stick to improving his knowledge 
of the Charger playbook. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the publicity goes, I really don't attract that much," he says. "Not 
that many people want to talk to me because generally I don't have anything 
smart to say. I don't have any wisecracks. In general, I'm not a very smart 
guy. The only thing I know is Xs and Os and that stuff gets boring." 
</P>
<P>
How about some more self-evaluation, Billy? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a very gifted athlete," he says. "I'm not very good at anything, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Let's get this straight. He says he's not a gifted athlete and not very smart. 
He isn't exactly nimble on his feet, and he has practically no experience. 
</P>
<P>
So what the heck is Billy Joe Tolliver doing starting at quarterback in the 
NFL? 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a feel for the game and a strong arm," Henning says. "He's ready to 
make the big plays." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important than the strength of his arm is the strength of his 
heart. Watch practice, and you'll find Tolliver takes each snap as seriously as 
if he's playing for a playoff berth. Wednesday morning, the Chargers were 
working on the two-minute offense. Tolliver drove the team inside the 20 but 
was a split second late getting the last snap off before the whistle blew. 
Disgusted, he turned and punted the ball over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver wants to be good, and he wants to do it in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage in his life that's normal," Henning says. "He's 24 years old. 
Everybody wants to be where they want to be as quickly as they can get there." 
</P>
<P>
And while there are brief moments of frustration, Tolliver is handling himself 
with a poise that is encouraging to Henning. Tolliver doesn't waste a lot of 
time dwelling on his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy that's difficult to get down," Henning says. "He may get down for a 
few minutes, but he's quick to bounce back. He doesn't let things carry on and 
cause him other problems." 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest of the stuff starting quarterbacks need to do, that is still 
coming a little bit at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands that even though he's been given this opportunity, he's a long 
way from what it takes to be a winning quarterback," says Ted Tollner, the 
Chargers' quarterback coach. "Yet he has the tools to get there, and we believe 
the mentality and emotional stability. We've got to work ourselves through the 
rough spots so he can get there." 
</P>
<P>
While that happens, Vlasic and Friesz will do their best to make sure they 
aren't forgotten. Vlasic, who missed all of last season with a knee injury, is 
in his fourth season with the Chargers and was impressive enough in the first 
two weeks of training camp to push Archer off the roster. 
</P>
<P>
Last season was a long one for Vlasic, who suffered his injury in November, 
1988, in a game against the Rams and never fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
So, while the other quarterbacks were taking snaps in training camp last 
summer, Vlasic spent his time doing rehabilitation exercises and a few warmup 
drills on the sideline. And then when he was healthy enough to take the field, 
he was assigned to run the opponent's offense against the Chargers' defense. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed. Having made steady progress throughout camp, Vlasic is 
feeling good again about his chances to eventually become a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of exciting," he says. "It's been awhile since I've been in there." 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, the Chargers don't have plans to make him the starter. Henning 
has stated clearly that Tolliver will fill that role when the regular season 
begins unless there is a "drastic" set of events. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't alter Vlasic's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody that's out here is looking for any other position than 
the starting job," he says. "As soon as you're satisfied with being behind 
somebody, you're not working for the team any more. The entire team gets better 
by each competition at each position." 
</P>
<P>
Friesz, a sixth-round draft selection, is last in the pecking order but has had 
a solid camp. That isn't to say he didn't go through a few hectic moments in 
mini-camp and the first two weeks of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The knowledge part of it was overwhelming at first," he said. "But I have a 
pretty good grip on it now." 
</P>
<P>
His biggest adjustment has been contending with the defensive backs, who are a 
good deal more deceptive than the ones he faced at the University of Idaho, 
where he set 24 school, 18 conference and five NCAA Division I-AA records to 
put him fifth on the all-time career passing list with 10,697 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They can cheat," he says. "They'll bait you into doing something, but with 
their athletic ability they can get back in time to make the play." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, all three quarterbacks are still feeling their way around like a few 
guys who have showed up late to a movie. The hope at Charger camp is that they 
will find their direction in time for the Sept. 9 regular-season opener at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said there were no new negotiations on 
the contracts of first-round draft selection Junior Seau and outside linebacker 
Leslie O'Neal. . . . Three tight ends suffered minor injuries in Wednesday's 
practices. Arthur Cox strained his back, Derrick Walker injured his shoulder, 
and Craig McEwen experienced some numbness in his hand after it was stepped on. 
Charger Coach Dan Henning did not know the extent of Cox and Walker's injuries. 
. . . The Chargers worked on a drill in their afternoon practice requiring 
players to adjust to field position changes. Afterward, Henning commented: "It 
appeared in this little drill that we either have a great defense or a (bad) 
offense. I would imagine it's somewhere in between." . . . Inside linebacker 
Gary Plummer and Frank Cornish, a rookie center/guard from UCLA, got into a 
scuffle midway through the afternoon practice and had to be separated twice. 
Said Cornish: "It wasn't anything serious. It happens in practice. You play a 
hostile sport, sometimes you get hostile." . . . The Dallas Cowboys will arrive 
in town Friday night for Saturday's exhibition at 7 p.m. in San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. They will stay through the following Thursday and are scheduled 
to practice with the Chargers Monday and Tuesday at UCSD.

EXPERIENCE HAS EDGE ON GAVALDON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's called a home-court advantage, but on this day, it worked against one 
local player for a while. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diegan advanced to the quarterfinals of the $225,000 Great American Bank 
tennis tournament, but that seemed to escape the notice of most. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido's Ros Fairbank-Nideffer, a native of South Africa, staged a 
courageous comeback against teen darling Angelica Gavaldon of Coronado 
Wednesday afternoon at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. But the crowd 
of 2,910 was mostly disappointed after Fairbank-Nideffer's 4-6, 7-5, 6-0 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny walking out onto the court," Fairbank-Nideffer said, "everyone 
was shouting, 'Angelica, Angelica! Get her autograph.' And I'm thinking, 'No 
one evens knows me here.' It's a strange position to be in, because I'm not an 
underdog, I'm expected to win. But a lot of the crowd feels like she's the big 
player in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier center court match, fifth-seeded Zina Garrison had an easier time 
against Aspen's Gigi Fernandez, winning 6-2, 6-2. And in the featured evening 
match, Florida's Kathy Rinaldi hung on longer than most against the best female 
player in the world, stretching it to 77 minutes before losing to Steffi Graf, 
6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just terrible," Graf said. "I really didn't play well at all. I was 
angry with myself." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently. But Rinaldi begged to differ. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not dominant like she was before," Rinaldi said. "I'm not trying to take 
anything away from her, she's still incredible, she's still a phenomenal 
athlete, but people are starting to catch on." 
</P>
<P>
Once the No. 7 player in the world but now ranked 72nd, Rinaldi's budding 
career was stopped short after she broke her thumb in the 1987 French Open and 
sat out all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so much better when I walk on the court," she said. "I'm just happy to 
be playing now." 
</P>
<P>
Graf conceded that Rinaldi made some great shots and had a good first serve, 
but she was mostly hard on herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She hit some good shots," Graf said, "but I didn't finish them up. I didn't 
come in, I didn't step in and finish them right away." 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Garrison, weakened from the flu and having had very little to eat 
all week, said she almost had to withdraw, but officials delayed her first 
singles match, giving her adequate time to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova withdrew Tuesday because of an ankle injury, and Garrison's 
appearance ensured that the tournament hadn't lost another top draw, the 
world's fifth-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
"I was close to pulling out," she said. "But I was able to get a late start. 
Maybe it was meant for me to get some rest." 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-Nideffer's victory was as much psychological as it was physical. Two 
years ago here, she lost to Ann Grossman, then 17, in a weak draw, and last 
year Gavaldon, now 16, upset her in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-Nideffer said she battled the fans and lost focus on those occasions. 
And when she was down a set and trailed, 2-5, in the second, that possibility 
again reared its head. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was down, 5-2, a lot of things were going through my head," she said. 
"I could have exploded and let the match go." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she turned it completely around. Although Gavaldon served for the 
match at 5-3 and had a match point, a nerve struck Fairbank-Nideffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept thinking, 'What am I going to say to these press people?' " she said. 
"It's just a matter of a couple of points. I just reminded myself that it was 
that close." 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-Nideffer started rushing the net, forcing Gavaldon into errors from 
the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
"That put more pressure on her," Fairbank-Nideffer said. "I believed I could 
come back. I never thought I wouldn't win." 
</P>
<P>
For Gavaldon, who turned professional after reaching the quarterfinals of the 
Australian Open earlier in the year, it was another reminder that although she 
has come a long way since winning high school championships on these same 
courts, she still has a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my problems is, I never play exactly the way I should play. I always 
let a few games slip by," Gavaldon said. "I can't afford to give games away, 
especially with a player who has so much experience." 
</P>
<P>
After taking her 5-2 lead in the second, Gavaldon lost 11 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-Nideffer could have easily won a sportsmanship award for her gesture 
after she won the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon hit a shot both players thought was good, but the linesman saw it as 
long. It gave Fairbank-Nideffer the set, but she appealed to the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't do that to her on set point," she said. "I didn't want to win 
the set that way." 
</P>
<P>
The umpire nonetheless upheld the call. Fairbank-Nideffer, who married sports 
psychologist Bob Nideffer in May, 1989, said her new mental approach is a far 
cry from what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to make excuses," she said. "I'd be afraid to play someone, and so I'd 
make up excuses if things went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
She explained that in a tournament several years ago, she complained that there 
was too much fuzz on the court. That's right. Fuzz. 
</P>
<P>
"I created a scene," she said. "The reason I did it was because I was nervous 
to play that particular player." 
</P>
<P>

DAVE DISTEL: HYPHEN LADY DASHES KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tennis aficionados from here to Rosarito Beach were looking forward to the 
match. The Killer Kid from Our Lady of Peace, Coronado's own Angelica Gavaldon, 
would be going against none other than Martina Navratilova. At least, that's 
the way the bracket looked for the Great American Bank tournament. 
</P>
<P>
And that would have had the makings of fairy tale stuff -- just maybe Little 
Red Riding Hood would devour The Big Bad Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that was not the way it worked out. Navratilova had to withdraw 
because of a leg injury, though it's possible she heard about Great American's 
recent problems and wondered if she'd get paid if she won the darned thing. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened was that Navratilova's replacement was dismissed in the first 
round Tuesday by Ros Fairbank-Nideffer, who advanced to Wednesday's match 
against Gavaldon. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, through no fault of her own, Fairbank-Nideffer became a sort of 
party-crasher. She was not, to be sure, Martina Navratilova. And she was not, 
to be sure, a 16-year-old who could sweep the emotions (and support) of the 
crowd into her back pack and become destiny's darling for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny," she said. "Walking out, it was Angelica this and Angelica that. 
Let's get Angelica's autograph. It's like nobody even knows me here. A lot of 
the crowd thinks Angelica is the only player in San Diego. It's not irritating 
to me. It's understandable. Kids identify with her. She's a nice girl. She's 
likeable." 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-hyphen-Nideffer laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm an old lady," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Right, Ros, all of 29. And, oh yes, Fairbank has lived in San Diego County 
since before the hyphen, which she acquired last year when she married Bob 
Nideffer, her long-time coach. She has, in fact, lived here since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, then, this was more about age than geography. Not even maybe. 
Fairbank-Nideffer is young, but isn't there something disarming about this 
teen-ager who wears hoop earrings and a braided pony tail and pink lipstick and 
grunts with each shot as if she's trying to knock holes in both her racquet and 
her opponent's? 
</P>
<P>
Who could possibly root for anyone old enough to acquire a hyphen? 
</P>
<P>
Not many. Not at the start, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
However, what you get with a few (very few) years of age is experience. 
Fairbank had that. She boxed while Gavaldon punched. She played shots while 
Gavaldon hammered shots. She played for the route, and Gavaldon went for a 
rout. 
</P>
<P>
The first set, though, did nothing but endear the crowd to The Killer Kid, who 
fell behind 3-1 and 4-2 and came back to win, 6-4. She was gutty, and she was 
persistent. She pounded away from the baseline as if the court itself was mined 
and thus offered nowhere to tread. But Fairbank's shots came back as regularly 
as letters without postage. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the second set, it was hard to tell the old lady from the kid. 
Gavaldon was up, 4-1, and had scored 10 consecutive points. Fairbank looked as 
if the bus to her Escondido home was waiting in the parking lot. When it was 
5-2, it was time to turn the key on the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon never won another game. 
</P>
<P>
Period. 
</P>
<P>
Experience did. All of them, as in 7-5 in the second set and 6-0 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this was in spite of the fact that Fairbank protested the shot that 
won her the second set. Gavaldon's deep lob was ruled long, but Fairbank 
thought it was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't not say something," she said. "I couldn't take a set like that." 
</P>
<P>
She was over-ruled. She had to take the set like that. 
</P>
<P>
So experience and sportsmanship both were rewarded on this afternoon. She won 
it fair, and she won it square, because that was the way she insisted it would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Angelica Gavaldon will have plenty of days, here and elsewhere. She has not 
made the national splash of a Jennifer Capriati, but that may be because she is 
an older lady than the 14-year-old from Florida. San Diego will certainly 
follow her as she penetrates deeper and deeper into each major she enters. 
</P>
<P>
But the bottom line was that this day belonged to another kid from San Diego, 
albeit a little bit older kid. It might have taken a lucky break to get Ros 
Fairbank-Nideffer into this match, but there was nothing lucky about the way 
she got through it and out of it and into the next one. 
</P>
<P>
She deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, she belonged.

SmithKline Beecham: The Anglo-American health and household products company 
reported that its second-quarter profit was $303 million, 47% higher than the 
same quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based company said the good performance was highlighted by continued 
sales growth, strong operating profit and significant debt reduction. Sales 
were up 3% to $2.1 billion. The results are the second set reported on a 
quarterly basis since Beecham PLC and SmithKline Beckman Corp. merged in July, 
1989. Year-earlier figures are presented as if the merger had been in place in 
the second quarter of 1989.

profit for the same period last year. Revenue, at $1.6 billion, was up 3.8%.

West Coast Bancorp: The Orange-based bank holding company reported that its 
second-quarter net income more than doubled to $331,000 from $159,000 for the 
1989 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the six-month period, net income increased 10% to $707,000 from $640,000. 
The company attributed the stronger earnings to increased net interest income 
and lower loan loss provisions. As of June 30, total assets were $466.4 
million, a 3% gain from $452.2 million during the corresponding year-earlier 
period. West Coast's subsidiaries are Sunwest Bank and Heritage Thrift &amp;

JACK SMITH: AH, LIFE GOES ON AMID JACKHAMMERS AND JUNK

<TEXT>
<P>
When I finally succumbed to my wife's will and agreed to remodel our house, I 
promised never again to complain about it, even if things went badly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
So far I have kept my word, and so far I have had no reason to complain. I have 
endured a great deal of hammering and sawing, but somehow those sounds don't 
bother me. When I was a small boy in Bakersfield I used to hear those sounds in 
our neighborhood and I liked them. Men were at work. Something was being built. 
As long as men can hammer nails and saw wood the world has not gone over 
entirely to high tech. 
</P>
<P>
Our contractor is on the ball. His crew is competent and hard-working. Our 
architect hovers over the job like a mother hen. We are friends. The other 
evening our contractor and his wife took the architect and his wife and me and 
my wife out to dinner. The contractor brought three bottles of white wine in a 
sack. He had bought it himself in the Napa valley. Our waitress poured it for 
us. Now a man with that kind of savoir-faire has got to be trustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
However, I don't think my vow of compliance denies me the right to make 
observations or philosophize about some of the facts of our life revealed by 
this major exertion. 
</P>
<P>
I have already commented on the overwhelming amount of junk our garage yielded 
when we had to clean it out so the men could jackhammer the floor and pour new 
foundations for the rooms to be built above it. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly filled the small shack the contractor had provided for it, and the 
surplus now lies all about our swimming pool. It is open to the elements, but 
so far we have had no elements but heat. 
</P>
<P>
There must be an equation for the amount of space junk will fill when removed 
from a garage. I would guess that it is four to one. Maybe five. 
</P>
<P>
Our small service porch, whose inadequacy was the rather modest cause of the 
entire project, yielded even more, per square foot, than the garage. At first, 
my wife merely wanted to enlarge the service porch, so she would have room for 
washing and drying machines. I'm not kidding. She wanted to go back to doing 
our laundry. I reluctantly agreed to that, and was ultimately euchred into 
agreeing to two rooms and a bath over the garage. 
</P>
<P>
The articles removed from the service porch completely cover our patio table 
and also an 8-foot-long table that is kept in the front bedroom. I can't begin 
to describe this debris, except to say that almost none of it has ever been 
used, and none of it is likely to be used in the future. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the 8-foot table was one we bought years ago to augment the seating 
capacity of our six-seat dining room table for dinner parties. Except for 
Easter, when my wife annually clears the dining room table of her magazines, 
catalogues, mail, work sheets, tax forms, bank statements, bills and mementoes 
such as valentine cards and teddy bears, so that our family can sit down 
together on that holiday, we haven't had a dinner party in 15 years. The 8-foot 
table has never been used except as a catchall. The bedroom now also contains 
the eight metal and vinyl chairs we bought to go with it, but which had never 
before been taken out of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
What prompts me to reflect on these facts is a letter from Carol Kearns of 
Downey, reporting on a phenomenon that makes me feel that things could be 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
On a visit to the Museum of Man in San Diego, Kearns said, she saw an 
800-year-old mummy of a young woman that, according to archeological experts, 
had come from Chihuahua, Mexico. The extraordinary thing about this mummy 
though, according to Kearns, was that it was found in Lemon Grove by a woman 
cleaning out her garage. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns says she is not sure of her facts, and that I could call the Museum of 
Man, to verify her story. I am not moved by my usual reportorial zeal to do 
that. Kearns' story is good enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
You can imagine how lucky I feel that we did not find an 800-year-old mummy in 
our garage. 
</P>
<P>
But what troubles me is that, if we had found one, my wife would have wanted to 
save it. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, it would have been one more for that dinner we are someday going to 
give.

Tour de Force: A restaurant owned by champion cyclist Greg LeMond and some 
partners opened Tuesday in Edina, Minn. LeMond, a three-time winner of the Tour 
de France, is a partner in the Tour de France restaurant being run by Scott Kee 
and his wife, Lisa, who said Monday: "When Greg and (his wife) Kathy are in 
Europe, they go to all the best restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond lives in nearby Wayzata part of the year.

Purse Talk: Queen Elizabeth II does more with her purse than carry grooming 
items, according to Raymond Fullager, a longtime royalty watcher. He told a 
Charlotte, N.C., audience that the queen uses her purse to communicate 23 
signals to her staff, such as moving it from her right arm to her left to 
indicate that she is bored and needs to be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
Baker Break: In the midst of his recent hopscotching around the world, 
Secretary of State James Baker on Monday took his wife, Susan, to Maison 
Blanche in Washington, D.C., for dinner to celebrate their 17th wedding 
anniversary. He had his usual steak tartare; she had salmon. But duty calls. He 
leaves today for Turkey and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Color Them Happy: Though the company that makes Crayola crayons on Tuesday 
retired six colors to the protests of some, everybody went home happy. Company 
spokesman Brad Drexler said the demonstrators at the Easton, Pa., ceremony were 
friendly. "Where else can you bring in protesters and give them cake and 
crayons?" Another spokesman invited them to "come and see your favorite colors 
whenever you need to."

THE ORIGINS OF 'GET A LIFE!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Get a Life!" (July 26): I enjoyed Nikki Finke's article very much, but the 
statement "Get a life!" has been around a lot longer than she may realize. 
Perhaps a sketch on "Saturday Night Live" helped popularize the expression, but 
my ex-girlfriend's best friend used to say it frequently in 1979, with the same 
intent it has today. 
</P>
<P>
If she read the piece and some of the dates presented therein for this phrase's 
possible origins (1986, 1988) . . . well, you know what she would have said.

BLACK FRATERNITY OUT OF UNIFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Elite Fraternity Widens Agenda for Black Men" (July 18): Black men are 
surrounded by drugs, gangs, inadequate education and hopelessness. A 
once-secret fraternity of prominent men decides that now is the time to come 
out of the closet and try to find a role in the solution to these problems. 
</P>
<P>
While I believe that the war against drugs, gangs, unemployment and inadequate 
education is winnable, the tuxedo will not be the uniform of the victorious. 
This war will be won by those who are not afraid to get their blue jeans dirty. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, preachers, counselors and community volunteers we need will not 
be found at the captain's cocktail party while the battle is waged.

'HOTTEST JOB': SALARIES COST CITY, COUNTY TOO MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to comment on your firefighter article ("L.A.'s Hottest Job," July 
27). The firefighters have never gotten the publicity that the police do in a 
job that is probably more dangerous. The Los Angeles County firefighters in 
particular set a standard in bravery, professionalism and quality of service 
that is the envy of every agency in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But the compensation for those outstanding men is unconscionable in a world of 
limited resources. Entry-level salaries of $35,000, journeyman at $45,000, and 
supervisor at $60,000 for a job that takes about one year of post-secondary 
education and training is just the start. Benefits of early retirement and 
prime medical add another 80% to 100% to the total. 
</P>
<P>
The work is very easy by any standard. One fire call a day is a hard day. Most 
days are spent polishing fixtures, reading the paper and sleeping, so they can 
do some real work on their second job. If a firefighter does paramedic and 
actually has to respond to calls, he gets about a 15% bonus. Early retirement 
and second jobs make firefighters the quintessential double-dippers. With these 
wages, benefits and duties, it is no wonder why hundreds of applicants appear 
for every job opening. 
</P>
<P>
The fault does not lie with these outstanding men. It lies squarely with the 
members of the Board of Supervisors, who are afraid of opposing the police and 
fire associations. Los Angeles County and the city have always paid higher than 
any other agencies and dragged the rest of the market behind them. 
</P>
<P>
And what is the financial status of this lavish spender? Los Angeles County 
cannot pay for hospitals to provide care for AIDS victims, cannot provide 
welfare service, has no jail space, sanitation disposal sites, etc. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where government cannot seem to make rational economic and service 
decisions -- we need only cite the current budget impasses in Washington and 
Sacramento -- the county's policy to pay firefighters (and sheriffs) 
top-of-the-market wages is the height of the irrational.

BOLSHOI BRINGS 'IVAN' THE TAWDRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bolshoi is back. The mighty, exotic Bolshoi. Gosh. Whoopee. Jeer. Sigh. 
Sob. 
</P>
<P>
No other ballet company inspires such mixed or such passionate reactions. No 
other ballet company has endured such grandiose vicissitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The general public here was conditioned long ago to equate this ensemble from 
mysterious Moscow with athletic bravura in aesthetic excelsis. Told by press 
agents that the Bolshoi is "immortal," audiences that normally avoid tutus and 
toe shoes respond to these visitors with push-button ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
The masses obviously respond to the extravagant ads. Never mind that the 
lay-outs feature a flying matinee idol who no longer happens to be with the 
company, or that the texts carefully avoid the dirty word ballet. The Russians, 
we are assured, still "soar above the rest!" 
</P>
<P>
The American press has responded with a certain skepticism. The only champion 
turned out to be Anna (a wag might call her Pollyanna) Kisselgoff of the New 
York Times. Mustering a brave semblance of enthusiasm, she wrote that "The 
Bolshoi was much better than expected, not quite as excellent as hoped." 
</P>
<P>
Tobi Tobias of New York Magazine, on the other hand, found the company "in a 
pitiable state." Dale Harris of the Wall Street Journal lamented "a level of 
mediocrity that even undiscriminating audiences are bound to notice before too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
"The company has got weaker," observed Arlene Croce of the New Yorker "American 
audiences," she added, "don't seem to have noticed the drop in quality -- they 
go on celebrating the mystique." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the recent opening at Lincoln Center for the Village Voice, Deborah 
Jowitt complained of being "gradually numbed" by Yuri Grigorovich's "Ivan the 
Terrible." It was the selfsame "Ivan" that inaugurated the 14-performance 
season at Shrine Auditorium on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some apparent papering, the 6,300-seat cavern wasn't quite full. Still, 
a healthy crowd came to cheer, and did. 
</P>
<P>
For at least one minority reporter, however, this seemed a case of better never 
than late. "Ivan the Terrible" was new, and controversial, back in 1975. Sol 
Hurok did not deem it worth exporting to Los Angeles at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In those distant days, Ivan IV served as a grateful vehicle for two virtuoso 
danseurs: Yuri Vladimirov played the barbaric czar with almost unbearable 
muscular frenzy, while Vladimir Vasiliev stressed the protagonist's complex 
moods, shifting subtly and gradually from pathetic insecurity to crazed power. 
</P>
<P>
With such compelling artists in the central role, it was possible -- from time 
to time -- to overlook the abiding kitsch and the tawdry excesses. Vladimirov 
and Vasiliev somehow obscured the vapidity of Grigorovich's fussy and 
repetitive choreographic routines, inspired to a degree by the celebrated 
Eisenstein film. 
</P>
<P>
A genuinely magnetic czar could draw attention away from the simplistic, nearly 
comic military maneuvers imposed on the strutting men, the limp cliches visited 
upon the slinking women, the primitive symbolism sporadically employed to 
embellish the scenario. Given the right distractions, a friendly observer could 
try to ignore the political ambiguities that popped out of the quasi-historic 
libretto, not to mention the passing infelicities of the Prokofiev pastiche 
drafted as a supportive score. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so easy to look the other way on Tuesday. Given Irek Mukhamedov's 
post-perestroika defection to the Royal Ballet, the Bolshoi's premier Ivan now 
seems to be Alexander Vetrov. 
</P>
<P>
He is a solid technician and a conscientious, hard-working actor. He stalks the 
throne with spidery authority, partners his beloved Anastasia attentively in 
the acrobatic love duets, scowls continuously and ferociously, hoists himself 
picturesquely in the ubiquitous bell ropes for the ambiguous crucifixion pose 
that heralds the final curtain. Ultimately, alas, he settles for a 
one-dimensional, lightweight performance that conveys much agony, little 
ecstasy and only the vaguest compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Gedeminas Taranda missed the last Bolshoi tour because he seemed a defection 
risk, or because he had been injured, or because he was being punished for some 
odd amorous indiscretion at home. We have heard all three explanations. In any 
case, he made his belated local debut on this occasion as Ivan's 
friend-turned-enemy, Prince Turbsky. Although his chunky physique proved 
somewhat disadvantageous, he exuded a nice aura of crafty ardor and mastered 
Grigorovich's nasty kicks and heroic leaps with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Bilova replaced the reportedly indisposed Alla Mikhalchenko as Anastasia 
(a role created by and for Grigorovich's wife, Natalia Bessmertnova). Bilova 
stressed the same stoic, willowy lyricism as rapturous bride, willing martyr 
and grieving ghost. 
</P>
<P>
The busy corps strutted, pranced, crouched and/or gesticulated with disciplined 
gusto, whether impersonating Boyars, Oprichnina (a.k.a. members of the KGB), 
death figures bearing scythes, clowns or warriors. Although the ads promised a 
company of 160, that would seem to be a matter of wishful hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Virsaladze's simple decors, a clever network of circular playing areas 
defined by flexible curtains of gauze, reinforced cinematic fluidity, as did 
Boris Lelyukhin's shadowy lighting scheme. The only glitch: an odd procedural 
mishap that constantly allowed the audience to view the dancers preparing for 
their entrances while stationed behind the central platform. 
</P>
<P>
In the locally staffed pit, Alexander Kopylov tended efficiently -- no more, no 
less -- to the Prokofiev mish-mash accommodatingly arranged by Mikhail Chulaki. 
It comprised obvious portions of the Eisenstein sound track plus excerpts from 
the Third Symphony, the "Russian Overture" and "Alexander Nevsky." The crucial 
ringing of bells, a Greek-chorus device much favored by Grigorovich on the 
stage, was more seen than heard.

AUSTRALIANS PLAY IT SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a passage early in the second act of the Australian Ballet "Giselle" 
where Ulrike Lytton's icy force as Myrta and John Lanchbery's swift, urgent 
conducting momentarily propel the company beyond glazed rectitude into 
something like glory. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in the allegro ensemble preceding Giselle's entrance from the grave, we 
watch the full potential of 19 women and the full power of "Giselle" as 
Romantic dance-drama mutually realized. It's an achievement that earns the 
Wilis the biggest curtain-call ovation at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center -- but it also confirms the worst about the evening as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
In its first Southern California visit in nearly 20 years, the Australian 
Ballet continually demonstrates its good taste and elegant manners, but that's 
pretty much as far as it goes. Once you've savored the beautifully finished 
hands, the immaculately pointed feet and the aristocratic placement -- virtues 
rare in our own ballet companies -- what's left? 
</P>
<P>
A sense of duty and rigid expressive restraint. Certainly, everyone looked 
ready to dance on Tuesday (opening night of a seven-performance engagement): 
coached and rehearsed to a glossy proficiency very much in the British ballet 
tradition. But, for all its picture-perfect refinement, their dancing proved 
consistently underpowered and even anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Working from the same Royal Ballet heritage, the dancers in National Ballet of 
Canada deliver just as impressive stylistic nicetities but also blaze with 
individuality. Dancing releases them into something greater than themselves and 
we're delighted to be invited along. In contrast, the Australians seem to be 
aiming for nothing more than our respect. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligent and opulent, the four-year-old staging of "Giselle" by artistic 
director Maina Gielgud seems unusual only in a few details: building the 
peasant pas de deux dancers into genuine characters, for example, or having 
Albrecht dance his Act I solo later than usual (he also carries white roses in 
Act II, instead of the customary lilies). 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it may be memorable chiefly for its unyieldingly monochromatic Peter 
Farmer designs. In the relentlessly earth-toned first act, for instance, 
Giselle doesn't wear her traditional blue dress but instead appears in pale 
yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Pavane brings to the role a deep understanding of Romantic style, but her 
performance is both technically uneven and dismayingly overcalculated. Each 
reaction, each step, seems a test to be passed and even though Pavane passes 
most of them expertly, Giselle is nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Greg Horsman (Pavane's husband) sometimes abandons those silken 
Aussie terminations in search of a hotter, riskier attack. His portrayal of 
Albrecht could use sharper definition, but it's always alive and remarkable for 
its selfless generosity. Pavane and Horsman were both coached by the great 
Galina Ulanova and though this Albrecht can't always make his Giselle look 
weightless, his partnering brings out her most sensitive and responsive 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck with a rather flat concept of Hilarion, Steven Heathcote nevertheless 
manages to display glints of star presence and dancing prowess. In the peasant 
pas de deux, a very assured Elizabeth Toohey outclasses her occasionally shaky 
partner, David McAllister. 
</P>
<P>
To begin the evening, the Australians ventured something Australian for the 
first time on their three-city American tour: "Catalyst," by company member 
Stephen Baynes of Adelaide. Fluently set to Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos, 
this three-month-old creation assigns bravura combinations to Horsman and two 
women, contrasting them with lyrical choreography for Pavane and two men. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the vocabulary for each group isn't quite distinctive enough to 
make it a major event when Horsman and Pavane finally interact -- but the way 
they lead, manipulate and inspire a 12-member corps becomes very interesting 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Catalyst" bears a program note about "violent and aggressive" forces 
contending with "serenity and calm." Nonsense. The sweet, buoyant Horsman never 
looks remotely threatening any more than the tensely passive Pavane suggests 
serenity. What we see are principal dancers teaching a corps by personal 
example and instruction: the process of growth within a ballet company used as 
the subject of a classical showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
It's a big step beyond "Etudes," "Ecole de Ballet" and all those other 
brainless at-the-barre divertissements -- and it manages to make the viewer 
very hopeful about Baynes' own growth and the Australian Ballet's as well. 
More, please.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SAX PIONEER SAYS HE'S THE RODNEY 
DANGERFIELD OF JAZZ 
</P>

Today's light jazz prodigies, who rely heavily on electronics, owe a lot to 
Eddie Harris, who first plugged in his saxophone in 1965. On "The Tender Storm" 
album, released the next year, he turned in a pioneering electric performance 
that pleased even straight-ahead jazz critics. Harris, who opened five nights 
at Elario's on Wednesday with his quintet, has recorded more than 70 albums. 
Yet today he doesn't get much press and doesn't have a U.S. recording deal. The 
lack of interest, after all the successes, clearly hurts, although he keeps a 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., you're only great if you're in your 20s or 60s," joked Harris, 
53, noting that old jazz legends or hot young superstars get the most 
attention. "I started with electric sax in '65, but very few people connect me 
with what they call fusion, I guess because I'm still living." 
</P>
<P>
Harris compared his career to that of baseball great Ernie Banks, who never 
received his due because he played for the Chicago Cubs during some losing 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes guys can sit on the bench on popular teams and get more notoriety 
than a guy who's playing well on a team in last place," he said, referring to 
lesser musicians who become well known through associations with commercially 
successful acts. Is Harris the Ernie Banks of jazz? 
</P>
<P>
"Worse than that. I'm the Rodney Dangerfield. I don't get no respect. Come by 
and see the Rodney Dangerfield of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Those here who do come by to see Harris, who plays many instruments, will see 
him concentrate on tenor sax. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also has three albums on the way, all made overseas. They are a Japanese 
session including pianist Kenny Barron, an English recording including former 
San Diegan Rob Schneiderman on piano, and a trio album recorded in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
After settling a two-year legal battle with her record company, singer Diane 
Schuur is ready to get back to music full time. 
</P>
<P>
Schuur, who plays at Humphrey's on Friday night at 6 and 8:30, hopes to finish 
a new album later this year, her first since 1988's "Talkin' 'Bout You." The 
contractual dispute with GRP Records Inc. had delayed recording plans. In a 
phone interview from her home outside Seattle, Schuur was reluctant to give 
details of the conflict, other than to say it focused on both money and what 
she felt was inadequate promotional support. 
</P>
<P>
But she brightened measurably when discussing her personal life and music. 
Those who caught her performance at Humphrey's last year saw a drastically 
slimmed-down Schuur. She said she has kept the weight off and become something 
of a fitness buff. These days, she often heads for a swimming pool, exercise 
bike or treadmill, even while touring. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice has never been stronger. Schuur is that rare songbird who appeals to 
both mainstream jazz and light commercial jazz audiences. She can swing and 
scat in the tradition of Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgerald, or turn a lighter, 
contemporary ballad with the smoothness of Anita Baker. The 1987 album "Diane 
Schuur &amp; the Count Basie Orchestra" stayed at the top of Billboard's jazz 
chart for 38 weeks, she said. Both "Talkin' 'Bout You," aimed at light jazz and 
pop radio audiences, and the Basie project sold in six figures, according to a 
GRP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego fans can expect to hear material mostly from her last few albums. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too soon to get into the stuff for the new album," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuur will be backed by San Diegans Randy Porter on piano, Bob Magnusson on 
bass and Jim Plank on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Folk-rock singer Holly Near, whose music carries strong political and social 
messages and is released on her own Oakland-based Redwood Records, will open. 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Richard Elliot has never denied that he wants commercial success. 
He consciously packages his music to reach the largest possible audience. 
</P>
<P>
With his fourth solo album, released last year, Elliot, who plays Humphrey's 
tonight at 8, hit pay dirt. "Take to the Skies" sold more than 100,000 copies, 
placing him among an elite group of jazz-pop moneymakers. But at what cost? 
</P>
<P>
On "What's Inside," his newest album, Elliot undermines his own talent. The FM 
radio single is "Movers and Shakers," on which his horn takes a back seat to 
sappy self-help lyrics sung by Michael and Danny Sembello. But the best tracks 
are "Sea Breeze" and "Cantiba," on which Elliot cuts loose against a 
synthesized wall of tropical percussion. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Elliot's band will include several musicians from the new album. 
He plans to play material from all of his solo projects, especially the last 
two. 
</P>

No Idol Worship for MTV: Singer Billy Idol was told by MTV once again to cut it 
out. The original version of Idol's new video, "L.A. Woman," was rejected by 
the channel because of several alleged references to bondage. 
</P>
<P>
MTV objected particularly to the depiction of a Marilyn Monroe figure who is 
featured on a telephone pole as part of a dream sequence at the beginning of 
the video. Idol said that the image was to be a metaphor for what L.A. does to 
its women. The edited version of the video premiered Wednesday on MTV. Two 
years ago, the channel rejected Idol's original video for "Hot in the City." 
Chrysalis Records will release a home package in September that will contain 
unedited versions of Idol videos. BETH KLEID

Bernstein's Back: After a doctor-ordered rest of nearly three weeks, conductor 
Leonard Bernstein returns to work this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
His first assignments: preparing for a concert Tuesday at Tanglewood in western 
Massachusetts with the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, and an Aug. 19 
engagement with the Boston Symphony. Then, in celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of the summer music festival near Lenox, Bernstein takes the Center 
Orchestra on a brief European tour, ending Sept. 2. In mid-July, the 
73-year-old conductor cut short his tour of Japan with the London Symphony due 
to "exhaustion." BETH KLEID

GUERRILLA ARTIST ROBBIE CONAL STRIKES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
BILLBOARD: A HUGE SATIRICAL PORTRAIT OF NEA CRITIC SEN. JESSE HELMS IS UNVEILED 
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In North Carolina, where Sen. Jesse Helms is running for re-election, you can 
see the conservative Republican's face on highway billboards everywhere. But 
now the outspoken critic of the National Endowment for the Arts is getting top 
billing in Los Angeles too, thanks to guerrilla artist Robbie Conal, who 
unveiled a bigger-than-life satirical portrait of Helms Wednesday morning on a 
billboard in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of Jesse Helms as an icon of the conservative cultural brigade that's 
been on the move since the beginning of the Reagan Administration," said Conal, 
who has plastered city walls across America with biting political posters for 
the past several years. "He's an icon for the mean spirit that's sweeping the 
country. We in the arts community are just getting a dose of it now, but poor 
people -- and people of color -- have been suffering through it for the past 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The billboard portrait, which measures roughly 19 by 48 feet, superimposes 
Helms' visage on an artist's palette. The palette's thumb hole is centered in 
the middle of Helms' forehead, which is splattered with huge blobs of paint. By 
his head is the slogan: "Artificial Art Official." (The billboard is located on 
the north side of Santa Monica Boulevard, just west of La Cienega Boulevard.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never done a billboard before," said the 45-year-old artist, whose work 
will be featured in the upcoming Los Angeles Festival. "But its sheer size is a 
great weapon for an artist. In America, we read signs and images in a special 
way -- and we associate a huge public portrait with the Big Brother-style 
images of Stalin, Mussolini, Kadafi and (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"So I was taken by the idea of a stuffy old white man, with a hole in his head, 
looming large over West Hollywood and the artistic community that resides 
there. It perfectly captured the scary, totalitarian image I was aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
Conal, who rented the billboard space for three months, plans to change the 
title of the piece each month. In September, he says he'll replace the 
"Artificial Art Official" slogan with "Holy Homophobia." 
</P>
<P>
Conal acknowledged that if the billboard aroused controversy, he could lose the 
space prematurely. "The owners of the billboard (3M National) know what's going 
up -- and I was lucky that I found a sympathetic billboard broker who arranged 
everything for me. But who knows what'll happen, especially with the title 
changes?" 
</P>
<P>
Conal did the original Helms portrait in his studio, using oil paint on canvas. 
Then he had it adapted to billboard size -- and shape -- by painter Riley 
Forsythe. "He came to my studio to see the original," said Conal. "Then he did 
a huge translation of it, which is put together on six sections of plywood 
flats. The billboard painting company trucks them down to the site and puts it 
up with a crane." 
</P>
<P>
Conal wouldn't divulge how much the process costs; he considers it "simply part 
of my normal art-material expenses." He did admit that many friends urged him 
to put the billboard up in a more high-profile location like the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"I preferred West Hollywood, because I wanted to show solidarity with the gay 
community there," he said. "But I was also worried that if it went up on the 
Strip, people might think it was an ad for a Hollywood movie or a miniseries."

KEEPING FRESH BASIL

<P>
While basil should ideally be used as soon as possible after purchase; it will 
keep well for several days if treated like a bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
Strip leaves from lower ends of stems -- if leaves are immersed in water, 
they'll rot, and the fouled water will hasten the decay of the whole bunch. 
</P>
<P>
If roots are attached, leave them on; otherwise, cut a slice from the end of 
each stem, then set them in water to come up 3 or 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
In hot weather, the bunch should be kept in the refrigerator, but if 
temperatures are moderate the basil bouquet can sit right on the kitchen 
counter where it will both look pretty and remind you to use it up. LESLIE LAND

BASIL: THERE ARE 45 DIFFERENT VARIETIES; 
</P>
<P>
SEASONING: THE SPICE CAN NOW BE FOUND IN SALADS, SOUPS, SAUCES AND COOKED 
VEGETABLES.

Not so very long ago, basil was, for all intents and purposes, something dried 
that came in a jar and was used in making spaghetti sauce. Now fresh basil is 
constantly called for -- in salads, soups, sauces, and as a seasoning for 
cooked vegetables. Pesto -- the Italian sauce made of basil, Parmesan cheese, 
garlic, olive oil and pine nuts -- was a novelty less than a decade ago. Now 
it's so ubiquitous it sometimes seems as conventional as catsup. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, fresh basil has become a year-round commodity on the order of 
fresh parsley. Still, it is at its sweetest and best, its most abundant and 
least expensive, when grown under the hot summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 45 varieties of Ocimum basilicum, most of them edible and most 
of them delicious. In addition to the familiar sweet basil, there are: 
</P>
<P>
* Lettuce leaf basil, milder than the standard but with leaves so large they 
can be used as wrappers for such items as giant shrimp or strips of chicken 
breast. 
</P>
<P>
* Piccolo basil, a very ornamental plant whose tiny, highly aromatic leaves are 
perfect in herbed oils, pasta salads and similar foods where the bits of basil 
should be small but the darkening cut edges of larger leaves would be 
unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
* Opal basil, whose primary claim to fame is the rich burgundy color of leaves 
and stems. The flavor is there, but it's less pronounced and less sweet, and 
many find purple pesto more disconcerting than delightful. It does make pretty 
herb vinegar, though, and is a fine garnish for pale foods. 
</P>
<P>
* Flavored basil is known primarily to gardeners, though well-stocked farm 
stands or fancy greengrocers may offer lemon basil, anise basil and cinnamon 
basil, all of which do taste like their namesakes. Holy basil is sacred in 
India, where it is used in religious rituals, but its fine fragrance is not 
accompanied by good flavor, and it isn't (or shouldn't be) used in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
* Thyrsiflora basil, also called Thai basil, is the sweetest and most aromatic 
of all. Since Thai cuisine seems to be sweeping the country, we can hope the 
bright-green leaves of Thyrsiflora will soon be more widely marketed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, big bunches of good old sweet basil are everywhere -- at 
supermarkets, farm stands, green markets. This is the season to make big tomato 
and basil salads, to shred leaves into the sauteed zucchini and stuff them 
under the skins of chicken breasts. Now is the time to put up the pesto. Don't 
forget to leave out the garlic if you're going to freeze it; frozen garlic can 
turn bitter after only a month or two. 
</P>
<P>
And now is the time to experiment a bit, using basil with fruit, for instance, 
or to moderate between hot and sweet. It does both in the following, a very 
pretty one-dish summer dinner that takes much longer to tell than it does to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
 Since preparation is quick and cooking is even quicker, be sure to have all 
ingredients (including the diners) ready before you turn on the heat. 
</P>
<P>
SLIGHTLY THAI WILTED SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound lean pork (tenderloin or leg), cut in 1/8-inch-thin strips 
</P>
<P>
2 fresh hot red chiles (5 inches long and 1/3-inch wide at stem end) 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon lime juice 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon brown sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons peanut oil 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
2 large cloves garlic, coarsely minced 
</P>
<P>
1 scant cup Thyrsiflora basil or 1 heaping cup sweet basil (small leaves and 
tips only) 
</P>
<P>
2 medium nectarines, cut in 1/2-inch chunks (about 1 cup) 
</P>
<P>

2/3 of lettuce, stir well and remove wok from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Make bed of remaining lettuce on serving platter. Arrange pork mixture on top 
and sprinkle with green onions. Serve at once with rice or noodles. Makes 4 
servings.

BAKING APPLES, BARGAIN TOMATOES, TINY MUFFINS

The Summer Rose is one of the prettiest apples around -- clear, light yellow 
blushed with red. "It's a wonderful eating and baking apple," says chef Jim 
Dodge, who came across the variety in a San Francisco market recently when he 
needed to photograph pie apples for his book, "Baking With Jim Dodge," due out 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Summer Rose a great baker? For one thing, it holds its shape -- 
which means it won't turn to applesauce in a pie. And it exhibits a natural 
sourness, which Dodge says a good baking apple should have. He also likes its 
slight earthiness, which, he says, "makes it a more interesting baking apple." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, you can forget that old cliche, "easy as apple pie." According to 
Dodge, "apple pie is one of the most difficult desserts to make." And the 
choice of apple is crucial to the outcome. So if you're in a pie-making mood, 
look for Summer Rose and Gala, another apple that Dodge recommends. They're 
available at Bristol Farms in South Pasadena for $1.89 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Right now is a good time to buy big batches of tomatoes for sauces. The Grand 
Central Public Market in downtown Los Angeles, for instance, had tomatoes of 
decent quality at the bargain price of eight pounds for $1 early this week. 
Sometimes the price drops as low as ten pounds for $1. Jumbo sweet red peppers 
looked beautiful the other day, and they were only 50 cents a pound. That's a 
lot less than the $3.99 tag spotted at one supermarket. If mangoes are on your 
list -- and the Central Market usually has lots of them -- don't rely on color 
as a guide to ripeness. The Keitt variety, which is in season now, remains 
green when fully ripe. The mango is ready to eat if it gives slightly when 
gently pressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Bigger is better." That's been the motto for muffins, but smaller can be 
cheaper. Pioneer Boulangerie (2012 Main St., Santa Monica) has come out with a 
new miniature muffin in the same flavors as its jumbos. Six go for $1.69; you 
can get 14 for $3.49. The main advantage of the minis: you have room to munch 
on several muffin flavors at one sitting. Flavors include date-nut, bran, 
blueberry-bran, raspberry, banana crunch, poppy-seed, apple-nut, 
pineapple-carrot and harvest.

A GUIDE TO THE BEST PUPUSAS IN LOS ANGELES; 
</P>
<P>
EATING OUT: THERE ARE ABOUT 250 SALVADORAN RESTAURANTS IN GREATER L.A. MOST ARE 
MODEST IN STYLE, BUT ALL FEATURE AN ARRAY OF DISHES, HIGHLIGHTED BY PUPUSAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The El Salvador Cafe stands in a grove of banana palms in a decidedly 
untropical location -- the eastern part of downtown Los Angeles where concrete, 
not exotic foliage, is the norm. 
</P>
<P>
This is the city's oldest Salvadoran restaurant, founded 30 years ago. Now that 
the Salvadoran population has grown to approximately 500,000, it is only one of 
hundreds of places where you can get pupusas. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest concentration of Salvadoran restaurants is in the area that 
extends west from San Pedro Street in downtown Los Angeles to Western Avenue 
and north from Adams Boulevard to Sunset Boulevard. More than 100 are located 
in this central zone. The total in greater Los Angeles is about 250. 
</P>
<P>
Most pupuserias are modest places, located in neighborhoods where Latinos 
congregate. Often they serve Mexican food in addition to Salvadoran dishes; the 
juke box will be loaded with Mexican pop hits, and it may be necessary to speak 
Spanish if you have any questions about the food. Always there will be Latino 
families, and rarely do you find anyone from outside the culture. Decorations 
tend to be similar -- posters, photographs and murals of El Salvador; 
artificial plants and flowers; woodcarvings, straw items, earthen pots and 
other crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Pupusas are the big sellers, but there is plenty of other food. Anayas 
Salvadoran Restaurant, one of the more ambitious places, can produce at least 
160 dishes. Even the tiny Pupuseria La Teclena No. 2, on a quiet corner of 11th 
Street, offers a substantial assortment of food. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran beverages that go well with pupusas include ensalada, a fruit juice 
drink garnished with diced tropical fruits and shreds of lettuce. Others are 
chan con limon, made with chia seeds; cebada, a barley drink; rice-based 
horchata, and tamarindo, made from dried tamarind pulp. 
</P>
<P>
The following list suggests places that serve pupusas in Central Los Angeles, 
along with two non-Salvadoran restaurants that serve them. The pupusas range 
from $1.25 to $1.80 each, which includes the cabbage relish, curtido, and 
tomato salsa. Two pupusas plus a beverage make a good light meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Anayas Salvadoran Restaurant, 1101 S. Vermont Ave., Suite 102, Los Angeles; 
(213) 381-7582 or 7584; open Sunday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; 
Friday and Saturday, to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Anayas is a large, well-run restaurant that caters to families and, therefore, 
serves no alcoholic beverages. The kitchen is spotless, and there is a 
conscious attempt to eliminate fat from the dishes. Thus the pork meat for 
chicharron is thoroughly drained after frying. The Salvadoran drinks here are 
very good, and there is a list of typical desserts to try after the pupusas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Cuscatlan, 2200 West 8th St., Los Angeles; (213) 384-3020; open daily 
from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Castro, a veteran soccer coach, owns this restaurant, which has a decided 
sporty flavor. There's a function room where soccer clubs meet. And since 
Castro promotes the annual Miss Salvador contest, the walls of that room are 
hung with photos of past winners. 
</P>
<P>
Pupusas here are made with fresh masa rather than the dry instant masa used in 
many restaurants. A cheese and loroco pupusa was fairly bursting with loroco, 
and a chicharron pupusa was also generously stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Cuscatlan, one of the older Salvadoran restaurants in Los Angeles, moved from 
its old spot on 7th Street to this location just a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 El Izalqueno, 1830 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 387-2467; open Sunday 
through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular pupusas are fine here, but for a change try the rice flour 
pupusas. Ask for them stuffed with beans and eat them with the mild tomato 
sauce provided by owner Isabel Vega. Vega is from the city of Izalco, which is 
noted for its neighboring volcano, also named Izalco. The restaurant is 
riotously decorated in Salvadoran style with hanging plants and artificial 
parrots. If you haven't eaten too many pupusas, try the wonderful empanadas de 
platano -- banana fritters stuffed with custard and sprinkled with sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 El Palermo, 4136 W. Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 386-5279; open Tuesday 
through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday through Sunday to 11 p.m. 
Closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 This stretch of Beverly Boulevard is clustered with pupuserias and a 
Salvadoran bakery. El Palermo, at the corner of Mariposa, might be mistaken for 
an Italian restaurant, but it is genuinely Salvadoran, as the posters and flags 
inside indicate. The pupusas are appetizingly browned and made to order, so the 
service may seem slow. The intensely sweet ensalada is garnished with tiny bits 
of pineapple, unpeeled red apple and cashew fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 El Salvador Cafe, 531 E. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 745-8704; open daily 
from 9 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When this restaurant opened some 30 years ago, it was called Santa Rita and 
located on Main Street. What has kept it the same is the ownership. From 
founder Lydia Gutierrez and her daughter, Teresa Solombrino, both from La 
Union, the restaurant has passed to Teresa's daughter, Yvette Solombrino. 
Yvette has purchased this corner of Pico Boulevard, just west of San Pedro 
Street, and so the location should remain secure. 
</P>
<P>
Some things are missing here. The cheese pupusas don't contain loroco, and they 
don't serve the drink called ensalada. But the tamarind drink and 
Salvadoran-style horchata are prepared from scratch. And a little yuca goes 
into the chicharron. The cafe is small and cheerful and attracts a lively lunch 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 El Santaneco Restaurant No. 1, 2601 S. San Pedro St., Los Angeles; (213) 
748-3885; open daily from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceiling fans rather than air conditioning cool this unprepossessing restaurant 
at the corner of Adams Boulevard. The pupusas are nice, although there's not 
much loroco in the cheese pupusa. And the Salvadoran tamales are wonderful. 
Wrapped in banana leaves, stuffed with chicken, olives and garbanzos, they're 
unbelievably light. As in Mexican restaurants, you get chips -- very good ones 
-- and salsa with your meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Santanecos are at 1601 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 733-0875. 
Also at 482 E. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 745-7430. The Washington 
Boulevard location leans strongly toward Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 La Ygriega Restaurant, 3555 West 3rd St., Los Angeles; (213) 487-6560; open 
daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This neat little spot is named for the owner's hometown. White tablecloths 
overlaid with blue give a fresh look, and the eclectic decorations include ivy, 
Christmas lights and a teapot clock. The top price for a pupusa is $1.40 for 
cheese and loroco. Pupusas with other fillings are $1.25. In some restaurants 
the curtido and tomato sauce are mildly seasoned. Here they are very spicy. 
Instead of ensalada, you get fresh lemonade. And on Sundays there are specials 
such as chicken tamale. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkway Grill, 510 S. Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena; (818) 795-1001; open for lunch 
Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; dinner nightly, from 5 to 11:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Pupusas aren't on the regular menu but appear as occasional specials. The 
curtido that accompanies them is classic, but the fillings are imaginative 
concepts by executive chef Hugo Molina, who was born in Guatemala of 
Italian-Jewish parents. Molina guarantees the Parkway will have pupusas today. 
</P>
<P>
 Papaturro, 4109 W. Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles; (213) 660-4363; open Wednesday 
through Monday from noon to 12:30 p.m. Closed Tuesday. Also at 1133 N. Vermont 
Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 666-7290. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiters here wear Papaturro T-shirts, a sign that the restaurant is well 
established, although it's not very fancy. Pupusas come heaped on a communal 
platter and you transfer them to small plates not much larger than the pupusas. 
That makes it hard to eat without scattering food on the table. Ensalada is 
available only on weekends, and occasionally the restaurant runs out of 
horchata. But there is always at least one genuine Salvadoran drink: Pilsener 
beer brewed and bottled by the Cerveceria La Constancia in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Pupuseria La Teclena No. 2, 1443 W. 11th Street, Los Angeles; (213) 746-2510; 
open daily from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. A new outlet is Teclena's Flores, 149 W. 
Washington Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 749-1406. 
</P>
<P>
 La Teclena is located in a residential area that incorporates some small 
Latino businesses and a school. Although it's close to downtown -- a block east 
of Union -- it seems miles away and has a pleasant neighborhood feeling. An 
interesting touch is the addition of ayote -- shredded squash -- to the 
chicharron pupusa. The tall, pineapply ensalada is wonderful. But the cheese 
and loroco pupusa contains so little loroco, so finely cut, that it is hard to 
spot with the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
The new Teclena's Flores at 149 W. Washington Blvd., near the L.A. Mart, is 
advertising a bargain -- pupusas for 99 cents. 
</P>
<P>
(Under separate ownership are La Teclena No. 3, 1903 W. Olympic Blvd., Los 
Angeles; (213) 389-2809. Also No. 4, 2500 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 
480-9011.) 
</P>
<P>
 Texis, 3087 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 737-1434; open Monday through 
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Friday through Sunday to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Texis is not a misspelling of the Lone Star state. It's the name of a town in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Texis' chicharron pupusa has a great browned pork flavor. There are also 
cheese, bean and mixed pupusas for $1.25 each. Orders are taken at the counter 
fast-food style, but the pupusas are patted out in the traditional way, and it 
takes a wait to get them. They come with heavily seasoned, spicy curtido and 
mild tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is in a mini-mall at the corner of Western Avenue. Plain but 
efficient, it serves a workaday crowd and offers Mexican food too. 
</P>
<P>
Other locations: 2411 W. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 738-0743. 698 S. 
Vermont Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 387-8890. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palm Court, 11111 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles; (213) 479-1400. 
Pupusas available at breakfast Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.; 
at dinner beginning Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving pupusas for breakfast is a natural, although that's not the way it's 
done in El Salvador. The Palm Court's morning plate is an appetizing 
presentation that includes three small pupusas, two eggs, fried diced potatoes, 
charred tomato salsa and a little fruit for decoration. The goat cheese, 
ricotta and sun-dried tomato filling is not just trendy, it goes well with the 
pupusas and indicates how versatile these corn cakes can be. 
</P>
<P>
 El Usuluteco No. 1, 4021 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 663-9919; open 
daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Also at 1320 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 
482-4464. 
</P>
<P>
The black bars that protect the Beverly Usuluteco may make you think the 
restaurant is closed, but go right on in and enjoy some tasty pupusas. The 
cheese filling blends Mexican-style ranchero cheese with Jack, and the pupusas 
come out thin and crispy. The ensalada here is one of the best, made with 
sparkling water that is boiled, dosed with orange juice for color and finished 
off with lots of diced fruit -- apple, mango, jocote -- and shreds of lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the food, you'll be intrigued by the surroundings. The outside of 
the building is painted brilliant orange, and the high-ceilinged interior is 
done up in strawberry pink and peach. Red booths add still more color. And it's 
always a holiday. The decorations include Christmas tree balls suspended from 
tinsel trim and a sign that says, "Happy Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
(The Usulutecos are owned by brothers Victor and Jorge Ortiz, who also own 
Atecozol at 2530 W. Temple St., Los Angeles. Their mother, Lila, manages the 
Beverly Boulevard branch.)

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THERE'S THE BEEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the neat things about eating in Los Angeles is tracking the unexpected 
ethnic twists that pop up now and again. The Inca-inflected fried rice at the 
Peruvian-Chinese restaurants south of Hollywood, for example, or the lasagna at 
that Thai-Italian place down by MacArthur Park. If you want to sample Korean 
grill cooking modified to the Japanese taste, or the kind of Cantonese noodles 
that say "home" to a Salvadoran, you can find them, too. And if you're looking 
for a perfect triple-carom shot -- Continental cuisine cooked by Ecuadorans in 
an Argentine restaurant -- there's La Choza, a newish parrillada joint where 
you can dine on shrimp in Champagne-cream sauce and still get change back from 
your $10. It's the kind of friendly neighborhood restaurant you'd want in your 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
La Choza is a clean, modest place with upscale aspirations, located down the 
road from a dozen body shops, five minutes' drive from the Pasadena Freeway. 
You've reached it when you see the only Melrose-looking sign in Highland Park . 
. . lemon-yellow neon that reads, oddly enough, "Gaucha Grill" . . . and pass 
through the crowd of men who loiter around the Mexican cantina next door. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the walls are lined with thatch -- a "choza" is apparently a sort of 
hut -- and are decorated with plants and Ecuadoran weavings. A small television 
in a corner displays soundless nature documentaries; and on a scratchy 
recording, an Andean panpipe band 
</P>
<P>
rings many, many changes on a Simon and Garfunkel tune. On weekends, there's 
live music, and as many as 35 or 40 people crowd into the pint-size dining room 
to hear the thrumming guitar and eat hot, tasty empanadas. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you tried the parrillada?" the waitress asks, spreading her arms wide to 
indicate the immensity of the platter. "It is very, very good. Or the chicken. 
It is . . . how you say? . . . chest of chicken, with mushrooms and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
She points at her own chest in emphasis, and pronounces champagne 
"sham-pahn-yuh," in the French manner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very good," she says. "Also, Americans like the roasted pork. It 
is very good." 
</P>
<P>
"You tell us," my friend says. "Which one do you like the best?" 
</P>
<P>
The waitress shivers a little. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, none of them," she says. "Most of the time I never like to eat meat." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time what people like to eat at La Choza is meat, specifically the 
mesquite-grilled parrillada, a sort of garlicky best-of-cow sampler for two 
that includes slabs of short ribs, lobes of sweetbreads, tripe and an odd 
cylinder of steak, along with a couple of lengths of mild Argentine-Italian 
sausage and some chicken thrown in for good measure. (Not included in this 
version of the Argentine national dish is the traditional squiggle of carefully 
grilled spinal cord, which I don't miss, and the fat, pungent blood sausage, 
which I do.) 
</P>
<P>
The parrillada isn't the best in town -- that would still have to be at Don 
Felipe, in Hollywood -- but it's very good, cooked rare if that's the way you 
ask for it, and at $15.25 for two, including a green salad, something of a 
bargain. It comes with ramekins of the Argentine parsley sauce chimichurri -- 
the closest thing to a vegetable you're going to get on that plate, unless you 
count French fries -- and the terrific Ecuadoran chile sauce aji. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to say it: a-hee," the waitress says. "If you do not say it, I will not 
bring you any more. A-hee." We do try . . . the aji is worth a certain amount 
of embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, nothing but two full pounds of screaming meat will do. And sometimes 
it won't do at all. The "Continental" dishes here alone may not be worth a 
commute from Santa Monica or Rosemead. But La Choza's chef, who's worked in 
several of L.A.'s fancier kitchens, has a knack for thick, old-fashioned cream 
sauces, scented with mushrooms or lightly touched with garlic (also kind of 
oversalted), blanketing shrimp or chicken or noodles. It may not be La Toque, 
but it's a lot better than you'd expect from an eight-buck plate of shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The best food in the place, though, is found in the half-dozen Ecuadoran dishes 
on the last page of the menu: an Ecuadoran take on chicken-fried steak; the 
spicy, sweet goat stew called seco de chivo; a mess of tripe and rice called 
arroz con guatita. Especially delicious is the most popular Ecuadoran dish, 
llapingachos -- crisply fried mashed-potato-and-cheese patties on top of 
Ecuadoran-style roast pork with onions (something like a tastier, herbed 
version of carnitas) and topped in turn with fried eggs. 
</P>
<P>
La Choza, 5930 York Blvd., Highland Park, (213) 255-1900. Open daily, noon-11 
p.m. Cash only. Beer and wine. Dinner for two, food only, $15-20.

An industrialist from England has acquired the well-regarded Benedict Vineyard 
in Santa Barbara County, a 674-acre ranch that has produced some of the most 
successful Pinot Noirs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not announced, but the property had been listed for some 
time at $3.5 million. Some 100 acres of the property are planted to premium 
wine grapes, and as part of the deal, the buyer has agreed to market all the 
grapes through Sanford Winery, operated by Richard Sanford, one of the original 
owners of the vineyard. Sanford will be general manager of the property for the 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers of the property are Robert and Janice Atkin of London, wine 
collectors who are otherwise unconnected to the wine industry. The seller was a 
partnership headed by Michael Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
The vineyard, originally called the Sanford and Benedict vineyard, was 
originally planted in 1971. The first commercial wine from the ranch, the 1976 
Sanford and Benedict Pinot Noir, was a wine of cult proportions, with wine 
collectors knocking themselves out to get a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership between Sanford and Benedict crumbled in 1980. Sanford sold his 
interest in the winery and vineyard project to the remaining partners and the 
following year set up his own winery nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford said his winery would likely use all of the Chardonnay (30 acres) and 
Pinot Noir (30 acres) on the ranch. The remainder of the property is planted to 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling and Merlot. 
</P>
<P>
Californians may now order wine direct from Oregon wineries and retailers and 
Oregon residents may buy wine direct from California after the California 
Alcohol Beverage Control Board agreed to accept an Oregon wine shipment law as 
reciprocal. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the Oregon Wine Advisory Board has set up a telephone number for 
consumers desiring information about Oregon wineries that are actively shipping 
wine to California residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Oregon legislature enacted a reciprocal wine shipment law allowing 
Oregon residents to receive up to two cases per month of wine from a retailer 
or winery in another state that affords similar privileges to its residents. 
</P>
<P>
After clarifying language in the Oregon law, California became the first state 
to comply with it. California also has reciprocal wine shipment agreements with 
Colorado, Wisconsin and New Mexico -- the only other states that have thus far 
passed reciprocal wine shipment statutes. 
</P>
<P>
For information about the availability of Oregon wines, California residents 
may call (800) 242-2363. Oregon has about 85 wineries, most of them small with 
no resources to market a wide selection in other states. The reciprocal trade 
law permits Oregon wineries to ship small amounts of these wines to interested 
consumers, and permits Oregon consumers to do likewise with small California 
wineries who don't distribute in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 100 wineries and grape growers has petitioned the federal government 
to designate an area covering four counties south of San Francisco as the San 
Francisco Bay viticultural area. 
</P>
<P>
The petition to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms seeks to designate 
3,111 acres of vineyards in Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara and San Mateo 
counties with that designation. 
</P>
<P>
The petition seeks the designation in part because of a heritage for wine 
growing dating back to 1777 when the Franciscan fathers first planted grapes at 
the Mission Santa Clara de Asis. Climatic conditions are consistent due to 
proximity to San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Seagram Classics Wine Co. has set up a wine training program for restaurant 
personnel. Courses will be taught by Evan Goldstein, a master sommelier, at 
three Napa Valley properties of Seagram -- Charles Krug Winery, Sterling and 
Mumm Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Chateau St. Jean Vineyards and Winery in Sonoma County has formed Vinstar 
Imports to bring in a specialized line of imported wines. Among the items 
Vinstar will import are Chateau Beychevelle, Chateau Lagrange and Chateau 
Clarke of Bordeaux; Roagna Barbaresco and San Leonino Chianti Classico of 
Italy, and Sorrel Hermitage of France's Rhone Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A pocket-sized book called "500 Best Wines of Sonoma County" will be published 
next month by Tony Kendrew. The book analyzes all Sonoma County wines from 
their results in wine competitions during the years 1987, 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The book, which sells for $5.95, lists wines in order of most total medals won 
over that period, weighting gold medals over silvers and silvers over bronzes. 
On that basis the top-scoring Cabernet Sauvignons were 1984 Glen Ellen Estate 
($12) and 1986 Gan Eden ($18). 
</P>
<P>
Top-scoring Chardonnays were 1985 Dehlinger ($10) and 1987 Rodney Strong ($8). 
</P>
<P>
For a copy of the book, send a check for $7.32 (including tax and shipping) to 
Pileated Press, P.O. Box 4973, Santa Rosa, Calif. 95402.

Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
1988 Hidden Cellars Sauvignon Blanc ($9) -- Not one of those grassy, herbal 
styles that some people love and others hate. This wine offers more melon, kiwi 
and lime scents. But the wine was barrel-fermented and left on the lees for a 
time, so the result has some subtlety, with nuances of oak. Quite complex and a 
rich enough wine to pair with creamy dishes. Hidden Cellars of Mendocino County 
has long made some of the state's top wines, including Zinfandel and 
Chardonnay, but as the Hidden name implies, it has not always been recognized 
for its quality.

HEALTHFUL MEALS START IN THE KITCHEN PANTRY; 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: THE FIRST STEP TOWARD BETTER EATING LIES IN THE CHOICE OF FOODSTUFFS 
KEPT AT HAND.

Keeping a kitchen pantry well stocked used to mean hoarding shortening and 
macaroni and cheese mix. These days, the shelves of some homes are more likely 
to contain olive oil and spinach fettuccine. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news, because the pantry is the heart of any kitchen, and one that 
is thoughtfully stocked can provide the base for any number of meals. With the 
right staples on hand, you can fashion a healthy dinner in a hurry or flesh it 
out with a few fresh ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, chicken, lean beef 
or fish. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1989 Diet and Health Report, the National Academy of Sciences 
recommended that Americans get 30% or less of their calories from fat (no more 
than 10% of it saturated), 15% or less from protein and 55% or more from 
carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
But the current American diet is a lopsided mix: too high in fat and too low in 
carbohydrates and fiber, according to the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
The way to rectify this is simple: When stocking a pantry, add more grains, 
beans and cereals to increase carbohydrates and fiber, and replace fat -- in 
the form of shortening, lard and butter -- with sauces, condiments, herbs and 
spices. Here are some suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grains, pasta and flour. Broaden horizons beyond white rice with barley, 
bulgur wheat, wild rice, kasha, couscous, millet and whole-grain basmati rice; 
most of these are available in supermarkets. Remember that grains don't have to 
be a side dish. Reverse the proportion; make the meat the side dish and the 
grain the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to pasta, plain spaghetti is low in fat and high in 
carbohydrates; it's what you put on it that adds the fat. To increase fiber, 
remember that an ounce of some whole-wheat spaghetti has 3.5 grams of dietary 
fiber, as do many spinach fettuccine. By contrast, the same amount of regular 
spaghetti has about 0.5 grams of dietary fiber. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget about buckwheat and other whole-grain pancake and waffle mixes. 
When making pancake or waffle batter, combine a number of pantry ingredients, 
such as whole-wheat flour, oat bran and cornmeal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beans. Keep a stock of quick-cooking dried beans such as lentils and split 
peas on hand; these do not require overnight soaking and can be cooked in less 
than 45 minutes. Beans that require overnight soaking and more than an hour to 
cook can be frozen in one-cup portions and later added to salads or soups. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about salt intake? Canned beans contain more salt than dried ones, 
but they can be rinsed under water to eliminate at least some of the sodium. 
Mix beans and grains. Combine couscous with lentils and a splash of raspberry 
vinegar, whole-wheat spaghetti with pinto beans and tomato sauce, white 
cannellini beans with spinach fettuccine and a thin coating of olive oil or 
pesto. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sauces and condiments. These are invaluable for adding flavor without fat. 
Doctor a commercially purchased tomato or chile sauce with fresh or dried 
herbs. Do the same with salsa, which makes a great topping for chicken breasts 
or steamed vegetables. Combine two or three types of mustard for a coating for 
fish; spike it with horseradish. For sauteing without fat, use dry Sherry or 
dry vermouth. Add a dash of flavored vinegar, low-sodium soy sauce or 
hot-pepper sauce to steamed vegetables just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vegetable oils. Regardless of the debate over the merits of olive oil, when 
it comes to stocking a pantry, many nutritionists recommend keeping a variety 
of oils on hand. The point is not what kind of oil you use but the amount. 
</P>
<P>
In cooking, the main reason to use olive oil -- high in monounsaturated fats -- 
is the taste it gives foods such as salad dressings. Other oils, such as 
canola, safflower, corn and soybean oils, are all low in saturated fat and are 
best suited for preparations where flavor is not as important. Also stock a 
non-stick cooking spray.

MICROWAVE: SALADS -- YES, SALADS -- TO COOK FOR SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery.

<P>
Who would ever think of microwaving a salad? It sounds absurd, we'll admit. 
</P>
<P>
But just stop and think for a minute. There are hot salads, warm salads and 
wilted salads. And the microwave does them all to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
To prove the point, we offer three microwave salads to save and savor 
throughout the summer. Although our slaw is served cold, the potato salad and 
Carrots With Vinegar are traditionally served warm. 
</P>
<P>
If the idea of a warm salad turns you off when temperatures are nudging 90, 
simply chill these two recipes several hours before serving. They'll be a 
little less authentic, but no less delicious. 
</P>
<P>
HOT GERMAN POTATO SALAD 
</P>
<P>
2 1/4 pounds red-skinned potatoes of uniform size 
</P>

1/2 to 4 minutes until glassy. Add to potatoes along with bacon and mix 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Combine broth, vinegar blended with flour, sugar and 1 tablespoon parsley in 
microwave-safe 1-quart measure. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 3 to 3 1/2 
minutes, whisking at half time until dressing boils and thickens. 
</P>
<P>
Add dressing, salt and pepper to potatoes and toss lightly, adjusting salt as 
needed. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve warm or at room

BOTTLED WATER: NOT GETTING SOAKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL ARONSON, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even though many labels show beautiful mountain streams and cascading 
waterfalls, not all bottled waters are the same. Some may be little more than 
purified tap water. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a bottled water may not indicate quality. Heavy bottles traveling 
long distances carry high shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
So check labels closely; they'll provide clues to what's inside. 
</P>
<P>
There are 650 different brands of bottled water sold in Canada and the United 
States. Michele Asbar of Naya Beverages in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada, says some 
bottled waters are nothing more than treated tap water. 
</P>
<P>
"As with other products in the food stores today, consumers need to understand 
the differences in bottled water and become alert label readers," Asbar says. 
</P>
<P>
When choosing a bottled water, look at the label. The line beneath the brand 
name tells you whether it's natural, treated or distilled water. 
</P>
<P>
Natural spring water must originate from a natural aquifer, or underground 
spring, with nothing added or taken away. It may be naturally carbonated, or 
still (non-carbonated). 
</P>
<P>
Not all natural spring waters are the same. A major difference is the amount of 
dissolved minerals, or solids, they contain. The lower the dissolved mineral 
salts, the better the taste. However, you do want a small amount of minerals in 
the water or it will taste flat. 
</P>
<P>
The container used to bottle natural spring waters can make a difference in 
taste. For reasons of breakage and shipping weight, most bottles of still water 
are plastic. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the most common material, but using 
this material can mean the transfer of outside odors through to the water. 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a newer packaging material that does not 
allow foreign odors to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
Treated water is essentially tap water, with the harmful bacteria removed. 
Ozone and chlorine, among the most commonly used additives, are effective 
purifiers, but may leave a bitter aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
Distilled water is also known as demineralized and salt- and chemical-free 
water. Distilled water is tap water with the undesirable bacteria and the 
mineral content removed. This can be accomplished by charcoal filtration and 
deionization and, in some cases, carbonating the water. Distilled water can 
serve as drinking water, but the absence of minerals leaves a flat taste. 
</P>
<P>
If you drink bottled water, don't make ice cubes from tap water. "Cubes made 
from ordinary tap water can't help but detract from the purity of bottled 
water, so chill bottled water, just as you would fine champagne," Asbar says.

SCHOOL DISTRICT BRACES FOR CUTS OF $3.8 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: LOWER STATE FUNDING AND RISING COSTS LEAD TO PREDICTIONS OF A 
SHORTFALL BY 1991-92. THIS YEAR, OFFICIALS PLAN TO REDUCE SPENDING BY $500,000 
OR DIP INTO RESERVES. 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's vetoes of state education funding and rising employee 
health costs may lead to reductions of $3.8 million in Glendale education 
spending during the next two years, district officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Unified School District Board of Education was somewhat prepared 
for the vetoes, having adopted a cautious preliminary budget in June. But 
members said they hoped for more state money to protect the district from the 
cuts it may have to make. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a very, very conservative district, and we always budget like that, so 
when it comes down to matters like this, we thank our lucky stars that we do it 
that way," board President Sharon Beauchamp said. "But this was kind of a 
shock. I hope that legislators can reinstate as much of the cuts as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Officials will trim about $500,000 from the district's 1990-91 budget of $103.5 
million or dip into reserves and postpone the cuts until next year. An 
additional $3.3 million in cuts or reductions is projected for 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
District staff will not decide on what cuts to recommend until it examines the 
budget program by program, beginning in September. But one option is a $300,000 
reduction in data processing, said David Kanthak, the district's assistant 
superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
Kanthak and others predicted that they could minimize the effect of the cuts on 
classroom and student programs. Plans to install air-conditioning at six 
elementary schools scheduled to go year-round in July, 1991, and the addition 
of classrooms at several Glendale schools will be unaffected by the budget 
changes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Student enrollment is expected to grow by 3.7%, to about 25,000 students, this 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about something that is workable," Kanthak said. "It will 
definitely affect people. It will definitely affect the schools. But it is 
manageable." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian vetoed about $480 million from the proposed education budget by 
reducing cost-of-living increases and moving Proposition 98 money into school 
reserve funds, where it can be used only for an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature had approved a 4.7% cost-of-living increase for schools, but 
Deukmejian reduced it to 3% and cut items such as California Assessment Program 
testing and driver's training. 
</P>
<P>
"The priority of the governor happens to be somewhere besides education and 
young people," Beauchamp said. "He's not leaving a very good legacy for Pete 
Wilson or Dianne Feinstein. He's leaving a mess." 
</P>
<P>
The board, which was required to adopt a budget by the end of June, had 
projected a 3% cost-of-living increase and adopted a budget that was $9.5 
million higher than the $94 million budgeted by the district for 1989-90. 
Initially, that budget included a $600,000 reduction in administrative spending 
for items such as supplies, but did not touch classroom programs or a 3% 
reserve, as mandated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
But after adopting the budget, the district learned that a shortfall in state 
lottery and general funds would necessitate the additional $500,000 in cuts, 
Kanthak said. 
</P>
<P>
A 7.2% salary increase for teachers in 1990-91 and an estimated $2-million 
increase in health-care costs are expected to force the district to make about 
$3.3 million in reductions in 1991-92. That means the district may have to 
modify employee benefit packages or curtail salary increases, Kanthak said. 
</P>
<P>
A 4.7% cost-of-living increase most likely would have covered the shortfall 
from last year and substantially reduced cuts in 1991-92, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget scenario caused concern among teachers' union representatives, who 
will begin new contract negotiations with the district next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about, 'Well, the options are no pay raise or a change in the 
benefits,' that's telling teachers they're going to balance the budget," said 
Mark Desetti, president of the Glendale Teachers Assn. "I think it's too early 
to tell what's going to happen. A lot could happen in a year." 
</P>
<P>
For the next school year, district officials either will trim $500,000 or 
postpone the cuts until next year by dipping into a 3% reserve. But because 
that reserve level is mandated by the state, such a move would merely postpone 
reductions in the district budget until 1991-92, Kanthak said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, students ready to obtain driver's licenses may have to take 
driver's training through private companies if the district cannot foot the 
$195,000 cost of its program, Kanthak said. 
</P>
<P>
The district's budget has grown substantially in recent years. Student 
enrollment has increased 22% since 1985, with 24,400 students now enrolled and 
projections for as many as 28,300 by 1992. Most newcomers are immigrants or 
refugees who must go through costly special programs to learn English and other 
skills, Kanthak said.

VIOLENT WEEKEND LEADS TO 1 DEATH, 3 ARRESTS;

<P>
CRIME: RIVAL GANGS ARE LINKED TO 2 DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS. POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING 
3 OTHER INCIDENTS TO SEE IF THEY ARE RELATED.

A 19-year-old Atwater man was killed and three suspects were arrested during a 
weekend of gang violence that included five drive-by shootings, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the drive-by shootings took place within a block of each other -- near 
Avenue 34 and Verdugo Road -- and involved the same two rival gangs, said 
Detective James McCann of the Los Angeles Police Department. Police are 
investigating the other three incidents to see whether they are related, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The violence began Friday evening when four members of one gang drove by a 
house at 2706 1/2 W. Avenue 34 and opened fire, McCann said. Several rival gang 
members inside the house were armed and returned the fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the shoot-out, 19-year-old Anthony Marquez, who was sitting in the 
passenger seat of the car, was fatally shot, McCann said. The other youths in 
the car drove to his home in the 2900 block of Glenhurst Avenue and left 
Marquez in the car in the driveway, telling his mother that Marquez needed 
medical help, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez died several minutes later, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth who police say belonged to Marquez's gang has been accused 
of murder in Marquez's death. Police held the youth accountable under a 
"precarious liability" statute, alleging that Marquez was killed during the 
commission of a felony that the youth helped to plan and execute, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile, is being held in 
Eastlake Juvenile Hall and was scheduled to be arraigned this week. He faces 
charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit assault 
with a deadly weapon and firing into an inhabited dwelling, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, about six youths who police say were members of Marquez's 
gang were standing in front of a market at Avenue 34 and Verdugo Road when 
several youths from a rival gang drove by in a pickup truck and fired on them, 
McCann said. Witnesses told police that four of the six youths on foot were 
armed and fired back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths ran into a nearby lot, stashed their weapons in some refuse, then 
forced their way into a woman's home at 3322 Verdugo Road and hid inside, 
McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that they saw a youth with a gunshot wound to his stomach 
running away and clutching a gun, McCann said, but police so far have been 
unable to confirm the injury. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived at the woman's house, they were able to get her and her 
children out, McCann said, but the youths refused to emerge until about an hour 
later when a police SWAT team threatened to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Police questioned 10 youths from the two gangs and arrested two of the six who 
had hidden inside the house, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
Max Figueroa, 21, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a weapon in violation 
of his parole, McCann said. A 15-year-old, whose name was withheld because he 
is a juvenile, was arrested on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a 
negligent manner, carrying a concealed weapon and receiving stolen property, 
McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
In another drive-by shooting on Saturday, 20-year-old Johnny Rivera was shot at 
a bus stop, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera was standing with three friends in front of a 7-Eleven store at Avenue 
51 and Figueroa Street about 2:30 a.m. Saturday when several youths drove by in 
a black car and fired one shot out the window, witnesses told police. Rivera 
ran one block and collapsed where police found him, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera was taken to County-USC General Hospital, where he was reported in 
stable condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police also are investigating two drive-by shootings that took place late 
Monday night within a block of Monday afternoon's street shoot-out, McCann 
said. No injuries were reported in those incidents, he said.

SILVER LAKE MAN SHOT TO DEATH IN ROBBERY TRY BY 3 ASSAILANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old Silver Lake man was fatally shot early Tuesday when three armed 
men tried to rob him as he stood with two friends in front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told Los Angeles police that the assailants, one armed with a rifle 
and another with a handgun, got out of a van and accosted Robert Alex Gonzalez 
and two friends shortly after midnight in the 1900 block of Griffith Park 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The men demanded money, Detective Sam Sanchez said. Gonzalez's friends 
complied, Sanchez said, but Gonzalez hesitated and moved toward the garage. One 
of the men shot Gonzalez once in the back, and the assailants fled in the van, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was taken to Glendale Memorial Hospital, where he died a short time 
later, Sanchez said. Police have no suspects.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the summer baseball and softball seasons wind down, several Glendale-area 
all-star teams are contending for titles. 
</P>
<P>
The La Crescenta Babe Ruth all-stars, made up of 13-year-olds, were scheduled 
to play Wednesday night in the Babe Ruth Western Regionals at Carson City. 
Results were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
La Crescenta advanced to the third round by defeating Reno, Nev., 7-4, and 
Arizona, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the regional advances to the Babe Ruth World Series at Jamestown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Entering this week, the Crescenta Valley Little League all-stars were still 
alive in the Division 2 tournament at Long Beach. The winner advances to the 
Western Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley defeated West Arcadia, Laguna and Woodland Hills en route to 
Tuesday night's winners'-bracket showdown with Cypress. Results of that game 
were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
In softball, Nancy Evans had 18 strikeouts as the Centennial League all-stars 
defeated Tucson (Ariz.), 3-0, Monday in the opening round of the 13-15-year-old 
Senior Division Western Regional at Pinole, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial, which finished second in the 1989 Senior World Series, will play 
Red Bluff, Calif., today in a second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10-12-year-old Major Division, Lindsay Parker struck out 13 and pitched 
her seventh consecutive no-hitter as the Liberty League all-stars defeated 
Albuquerque, 6-1, and advanced to the second-round. 
</P>
<P>
Life in the fast lane: Tom Kendall of La Canada won his third consecutive 
Trans-Am Series auto race July 29 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, 23, collected $11,050 for the victory, averaging 105 m.p.h. over the 
40-lap course. The victory gives Kendall a 29-point lead over Darin Brassfield 
in the Trans-Am standings. 
</P>
<P>
Trading places: Distance runner Robert Nelson, who attended Pasadena City 
College last year, will transfer to Glendale College and James Moore, the 
Western State Conference 10,000-meter champion for Glendale (31 minutes 36.2 
seconds) this spring, will transfer to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Neither runner will be eligible during cross-country season. However, both 
could compete in track if the residency requirement of 12 units is completed 
during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson placed 10th in the Southern California junior college regional 
cross-country championships last season. Moore placed 17th at the Southern 
California regional cross-country championships and 21st at the state meet.

DRIVER FINDS FREEWAY FRENZY CAN BE THE TRUE TEST OF FRIENDSHIP

<P>
Since 4 a.m., I had been wide awake, staring at the acoustical spackle on my 
bedroom ceiling and wondering if I had time to develop a semi-debilitating 
disease, something that would prevent me from driving. 
</P>
<P>
I was thinking about the mission that loomed ahead of me that day. I was 
driving myself crazy. Well, close. I was driving myself to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It was my girlfriend's bridal shower, and it was being held at her mother's 
home in San Pedro. There would be no avoiding it. I would have to get on a 
freeway, maybe even two. 
</P>
<P>
I like to think of myself as a fairly well-adjusted woman of the '90s. I vote. 
I recycle. I am thinking about joining a health club. But when it comes to 
driving a car on anything other than a surface street, I become a woman of the 
cave era. 
</P>
<P>
I commute only 3 miles to work every day, and I never even have to look at a 
freeway on-ramp. It wasn't until recently when my Los Angeles girlfriend named 
me her maid of honor that I realized I had better buck up and learn to drive 
the long and winding road. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before The Day, I had my car tuned up, not wanting to take a chance 
on it blowing up and leaving me stranded. 
</P>
<P>
A week in advance, I taped the directions to my dashboard and began memorizing 
them at stoplights. The night before, restless and unable to sleep, I went to a 
24-hour gas station and had a real, live person fill my tank with super 
unleaded, check the pressure in my tires, and wash my windshield. 
</P>
<P>
And lastly, I made sure there was plenty of room on the back seat for The Cake. 
Early in my girlfriend's engagement, in an excess of giddy spirits and 
bonhomie, I had volunteered to supply the bridal shower cake. 
</P>
<P>
And then the day dawned. 
</P>
<P>
I first stopped at my parents' house to say goodby, operating on the theory I 
might never see them again. 
</P>
<P>
I was off. As the on-ramp to I-5 North approached, I bit my lower lip and hit 
the gas pedal, my eyes squinting in the hot July morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
For inspiration and courage, I popped into the tape player my cassette of the 
"Chariots of Fire" soundtrack. I shot onto the freeway and immediately headed 
for the most inviting lane, the second one from the left. 
</P>
<P>
As the sound of bagpipes filled my Honda Civic, I shifted into fifth gear and 
started doing 70 m.p.h. The car lurched forward with an effort, never before 
having been required to do more than 45 m.p.h., and I heard The Cake slide 
across the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
I was on I-5 several minutes before I stopped pressing my nose against the 
windshield and stopped strangling the steering wheel. I settled back a bit and 
began to survey my surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
I immediately was thankful for the lane I had chosen. Watching the fast lane, 
crowded with expensive European cars trying to do Mach 5, filled me with a kind 
of performance anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
I was equally glad I avoided the slow lane, where I observed an Iowa couple in 
their Winnebago wrestling with a California road map like it was an alligator. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing past Del Mar, Carlsbad, Oceanside, I began to feel at one with the 
interstate. Traffic was light, everyone was observing my cushion of space; I 
thought about becoming a truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
As I neared the U.S. immigration checkpoint at San Clemente, I sat up straight, 
took off my sunglasses and tried not to look suspicious. I wondered if there 
was a fine for traveling across county lines with a cake. 
</P>
<P>
Then I noticed a huge sign with bold black letters and blinking lights stating, 
"Caution, Watch for People Crossing Freeway." Everyone slammed on their breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, I watched two men in a dilapidated truck being pulled over by a 
green-and-white Border Patrol car filled with agents. The instant the men 
pulled their truck over to the shoulder, they leaped out and blindly bolted 
across the road. Drivers slammed on their brakes, and I watched the two men 
weave in and out of halting traffic, trying to make it to the other side of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to continue on through this human obstacle course, I thought I 
would just turn around at the next stop and go home. But traffic was picking up 
again and, before I knew it, I was in Mission Viejo, stuck behind a huge Blue 
Goose charter bus hiccuping thick, grayish-black exhaust. Traffic again came to 
a stop. 
</P>
<P>
After inching along for 47 minutes, I cursed myself for buying a car without 
air conditioning. Then I began to worry about The Cake. I twisted around in my 
seat and lifted the lid of the pink box, which had slid to the far right-hand 
side of the back seat. My fears were allayed. The buttercream roses hadn't 
wilted. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I made the transition from I-5 to the 405, but as I came closer to the 
city, I noticed a subtle change in my demeanor. My teeth were clenched, and I 
had stepped up my speed to 85 m.p.h. to keep pace with the other motorists. I 
still wasn't fast enough. The traffic here was more intense, more aggressive; 
there was less space between cars. I jealously eyed the zooming drivers using 
the shiny new diamond lane. I wondered if The Cake could be considered a 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
At last, I spied the exit I needed and shot across three lanes of traffic to 
get there. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I knocked on my girlfriend's front door, 3 1/2 hours after I had 
left my home, I simply said to her, "I've come to live with you. I'm never 
going out there again. Let's have some cake."

CATCH A WAVE; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH COUNTY BEACHES SWELL WITH PROMISE FOR NEW SURFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAUGHNESSY, Free-lance writer David Shaughnessy has been catching 
waves off the North County coast for 22 years and is a nationally ranked 
amateur surfer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you want to be a surfer? You've imagined what it would be like to stand 
majestically, yes, soulfully, even, on that big, blue sparkling wave. 
</P>
<P>
You'd ride that wave just like the best of 'em. You'd ride it right up to the 
beach and step gracefully onto the shore, where you'd be greeted by the bronzed 
surf gods and goddesses who await you -- your peers, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
North County offers wave riders some of the finest surf in California, and it 
does it year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Although surfing is known as a summer sport (and, by the way, real surfers 
don't consider surfing a sport, but a lifestyle or spiritual experience), it is 
the months of September and October that provide the best conditions along the 
North County coast. The crowds thin, and huge south swells combine with 
still-warm water and Santa Ana winds to give surfers the waves they live for. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to give surfing a try, you're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
As we enter the '90s, surfing, spurred on by a billion-dollar-a-year fashion 
industry, has won a spot even in the conservative mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Once frowned upon as a subculture of beach bums and feckless adolescents, the 
world of surfing is now solidly entrenched in American popular culture. Long 
the metaphor for a free-and-easy California lifestyle, surfing seems to be 
benefiting from a nationwide obsession with health and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Just how do you gain entrance to that boldly colored world of sand, tans and 
Raybans? Assuming that you already have the requisite rad surfer wardrobe (and 
who doesn't, nowadays), you could begin by plunking down $350 for a killer 
board ($400 and up for a longboard) and, oh, $200 for a wet suit (basic black 
seems to be making a comeback). 
</P>
<P>
When the ancient Hawaiian surfers wanted to ride the big ones, they would seek 
out a kahuna, or sorcerer, to bring the waves to them. Today in North County, 
you can seek out "Kahuna Bob" of Kahuna Bob's Surf School. 
</P>
<P>
In Encinitas, the school is in its fifth year of operation -- and the business 
is booming. "We try to get them started the right way," said 39-year-old 
"Kahuna Bob" Edwards. "We usually get them standing up the first day, and they 
have so much fun, they take four or five sessions. Once they meet with a little 
success, then they usually really go for it. I get a big kick out of it, too, 
just being able to be passing surfing on to people." 
</P>
<P>
Kahuna Bob's is open year-round, but is busier during the summer, when the 
school operates seven days a week, giving semi-private lessons with no more 
than four pupils per instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Although many would-be surfers are turning to surf schools and surf camps, most 
are still learning the old-fashioned way -- by trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot to be said for just going out and surfing, surfing, surfing, 
especially if you have a friend or two to share it with. 
</P>
<P>
On either edge of North County are two of the world's most famous surf spots. 
Both are great spots for learning by watching, but are too difficult for the 
beginning surfer. 
</P>
<P>
The bookend breaks of Black's Beach and Trestles are each as famous for their 
place in surfing lore as for their perfect, mirror-image waves. 
</P>
<P>
Black's Beach, on the north end of La Jolla, is well-known as a nude beach, but 
it also has what many surfers feel is the finest left break -- that is when you 
are in the water, the wave breaks to the left -- in California. 
</P>
<P>
Trestles, on the north end of Camp Pendleton, is that picture-perfect right 
break that at one time required surfers to sneak past the armed military 
personnel to get to the surf. If the unfortunate surfer were to fall from his 
board and have it wash ashore, it would often be confiscated by GIs in a jeep. 
</P>
<P>
Even on a gentle beach, surfing for the beginner can mean swallowing seawater, 
getting tossed around like a rag doll and getting hit on the head by your 
board. It can mean mouthfuls of sand and a surfboard as slippery as a bar of 
soap and with a mind of its own. 
</P>
<P>
It's paddling around for an hour, unable to catch a wave, then getting knocked 
off your board and having to swim to shore in the freezing water while being 
pummeled by the surf. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to learn not to feel pain," said Michelle Harvey of Carlsbad, who has 
been surfing without formal lessons for four months, "but most of all you have 
to get over the fear of the waves. I've been hit on the head, hit the bottom, 
been hit by other people's boards. It's harder than any sport I ever tried, but 
I can't give up. It's frustrating, but I'll get good if it takes 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Surfing has long been a predominantly male endeavor, but many of those deciding 
to try it today are women. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more women are surfing now," said Carlsbad's Pam Gilligan, a former 
competitor on the women's professional tour who now does promotional and 
administrative work in the pro surfing world. "Over the last two or three 
years, I've really noticed a boom. More and more women are realizing how much 
fun surfing can be." 
</P>
<P>
Most surfers say they have been asked at one time or another to give a surfing 
lesson, or at least pointers. Most wave riders will oblige, perhaps because 
they can remember the frustration and elation that came with their first 
surfing experience. 
</P>
<P>
When Phil Edwards, the legendary surfer of the 1950s and '60s who pioneered 
surfing in North County, was asked by Surfer Magazine about his most thrilling 
surf experience, he replied "the most thrilling time in my life was the first 
time I ever caught a wave and rode it all the way in. It was downhill from then 
on."

SURFING FOR NOVICES BEGINS IN THE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAUGHNESSY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can start learning to surf in your living room. The maneuver you need to 
master is standing up. You should practice time after time so that when you do 
catch that first wave, you'll be ready to spring into action. 
</P>
<P>
You don't even need a board for this part. Lie down on your stomach in a 
push-up position. As you push yourself up, quickly bring both feet underneath 
you, one foot in front of the other, pointing to the side. You should be in a 
crouched position. 
</P>
<P>
Do not go to your knees first, or stand up one leg at a time, as this will slow 
your progress as your surfing improves. Also, it's generally easier to stand up 
without being impeded by a surf leash when you are learning. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at your feet, you will see that you have already begun to forge 
your new identity as a surfer -- when you jump to your feet, one foot will go 
naturally in front of the other. If your left foot is forward, you are a 
regular-foot, if your right foot is in front, you're a goofy-foot. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, standing up on your surfboard will be a little more difficult than 
surfing on your living room carpet, but the principle is the same. 
</P>
<P>
Next, try to get started with the right board. 
</P>
<P>
Although the modern 6-foot, tri-fin boards that are used today are light and 
extremely maneuverable, they are rather unstable for a beginner. Try to use a 
7- or 8-foot board, or a longboard, which is 9 or 10 feet long. Softboards, 
which are surfboards made of spongy, Boogie board type material, are highly 
recommended for beginners since they don't hurt when you get hit by them. 
</P>
<P>
A fiberglass board, hurled at you with the power of the sea, can be a dangerous 
weapon. Just remember not to put your head or any other part of your body 
between the board and the shore when a wave or white water (the broken wave, or 
soup) is approaching. 
</P>
<P>
For your first ride, find a gradually sloping sandy beach, and stay clear of 
piers, jetties, rocks and exposed reefs. Go with an experienced surfer and stay 
away from crowds, but in the vicinity of a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Before you can catch a wave and ride it all the way in, you must first paddle 
the board out into the surf -- which can be more difficult than it looks. 
Sometimes it's hard just to lie down on the board without it squirting out from 
under you. 
</P>
<P>
Lay the board next to you in about thigh-deep water. Lie on the board with your 
head toward the nose of the board, with your weight distributed evenly. Center 
yourself longways on the board -- don't get so far forward that the nose sinks 
underwater, and don't get so far back that the nose sticks up into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Once you get the surfboard in position, start paddling out, one arm after the 
other, like a swimming stroke. Always keep your head up and your eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
You want to catch the white water rather than the blue face of the wave. 
</P>
<P>
When you see the white water coming to you, point the nose of your board toward 
shore and begin paddling smoothly. If you can, have someone give you a little 
push as the wave comes. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as you feel the wave has you in its power, and it's pushing you toward 
shore, place your hands firmly on the side of the board, right beneath your 
armpits, and spring carefully to your feet, just as you practiced. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, you'll understand what the Beach Boys meant when they sang, "Catch 
a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world."

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SEA FARE HAS A FLAIR FOR FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
French cooking has gone through so many evolutions and permutations in the last 
decade or so that we tend to forget that its preparation is not the province of 
madmen but of quiet souls who toil in the name of balance and good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Fare, a tiny gem of a place in a Rancho Bernardo shopping center, by and 
large maintains steady allegiance to the traditional themes of French cooking. 
It offers careful sautes and grills finished with light, savory sauces. There 
are moments when the restaurant wavers and threatens to fall by the wayside of 
over-creativity -- as with a coulis (a strained sauce) of strawberries and kiwi 
offered with oven-broiled king salmon -- but these moments are few. 
</P>
<P>
If the cooking, by and large, opts for formality, the service is rather more 
contemporary and easygoing. (However, addressing patrons as "you guys" is a 
style of speech that needs to be checked at the front door.) 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant occupies a small storefront in one of those anonymous, 
look-alike "convenience centers" that have become standard features of the 
Southern California landscape. Yet, the gracious mood and decor display a 
distinct personality, and the lace curtains, white linens and fresh carnations 
hint at a location somewhere in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood dominates the menu, which is written daily and recently kicked off with 
such starters as an unusual cream of tomato and mussel soup and a dish of green 
lip mussels moistened with a garlicky Provencale butter. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nine entrees were sauteed sea bass with an orange-rosemary-flavored 
hollandaise (quite a nice idea); jumbo shrimp and linguine topped with a fresh 
tomato-basil sauce of French rather than Italian inspiration, and squid 
finished with capers and browned butter. 
</P>
<P>
The day's menu also offered rack of lamb with its own roasting juices seasoned 
with orange and mint; cracked pepper-coated filet mignon sauced with Port, and 
veal sweetbreads in a cream sauce sharpened with green peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dishes sampled was a well-conceived (if a bit pricey at $5) Caesar 
salad. Garlic, which can be introduced to the Romaine lettuce in any of three 
ways (infused in olive oil or simply rubbed on the bowl are two of them) made 
its appearance via the homemade croutons, which planted garlic's pungent kiss 
on every leaf in the salad. 
</P>
<P>
Both entrees were prepared with flair. A quintet of giant scallops had been 
shaken in flour and crisped in butter, prefatory to a final bath in a smooth 
Champagne-based cream sauce flecked with fresh dill; this dish was smooth, 
savory and sophisticated. A charbroiled swordfish steak was cut thick to 
emphasize the meatiness of this fish and was cooked to just the point of 
doneness. The sauce seemed summery and cheerful and took a Mediterranean theme 
in both its name -- nicoise -- and its ingredients, which included chopped 
black and green olives, mixed green herbs, garlic and tomato. Coarsely ground 
pepper added underlying bursts of heat and brought up the flavor nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The too-brief wine list seems barely serviceable, although on most occasions, a 
glass of the house Chardonnay should serve well with any of the seafood dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert list offers several pleasantries, including a light but wonderfully 
rich chocolate cake confected without the aid of flour, and a delicious, 
Hungarian nut torte to which raspberry jam and coconut give a decidedly 
old-fashioned taste.

U.S. MILITARY FACING TERROR OF CHEMICAL WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
As U.S. Army forces take up positions in the Saudi Arabian desert, each soldier 
wears two awkward adornments strapped firmly to his thigh: a gas mask and a 
needle tinged with medicine. They are standard-issue antidotes for the horror 
of chemical war. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from American combat since World War I, the threat of poison gas now 
lingers over the Middle East in a looming battle over oil. According to war 
planners and outside experts, it could raise major complications for the U.S. 
mission in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein used nerve gas in his eight-year war against 
Iran and chemical weapons against rebels in Iraq. Whether he actually would 
risk an American counterblow by unleashing the weapons again remains a topic of 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts warned that Hussein's capacity to play the chemical card will 
further hinder U.S. forces in an already hostile theater, requiring them at 
times to don rubber protective gear in already unyielding heat. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole object of chemical war is to degrade the other side's performance," 
one intelligence official said. "In the desert, the threat alone may degrade 
U.S. troops from the start." 
</P>
<P>
With proper precautions, the analysts said, the current contingent of elite 
American ground personnel confined to airfield duty probably could escape 
serious harm in the event of a first-strike Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
But they warned that an expected American escalation -- and particularly any 
step to dispatch infantry forces to positions near or across enemy lines -- 
could find itself bogged down by the overarching need to guard against chemical 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a $9-billion U.S. effort aimed at fending off poison gas attack, 
experts express agreement that such a task remains "extraordinarily difficult," 
in the words of former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
And the problem is compounded by an adversary like Hussein, whose history 
reflects a willingness to use chemicals not merely in desperation but as a 
calculated instrument of attack. For Hussein, said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, chemical warfare represents "an 
ace in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized 
Wednesday that U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia are well-equipped and well-trained 
in the protective tactics designed to survive a chemical attack, even in 
searing desert heat. 
</P>
<P>
But he also acknowledged grimly that still-ambiguous intelligence reports of 
Iraqi commanders distributing chemical weapons to their troops are being taken 
very seriously. "It's a threat we're concerned with," Powell said. "I treat it 
as a capability that is there to be used." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of chemical war has been high on the minds of U.S. military 
planners for more than a decade, and rapid-deployment units like those 
dispatched to the Saudi desert have practiced poison-gas scenarios in war games 
in the Mojave Desert and in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Such operations have become more intensive with growing concern about an 
Iranian or Iraqi threat. And amid heat, sand and other desert hardships, they 
represent the best rehearsal for current operations. 
</P>
<P>
But periodic assessments by government investigators and intelligence officials 
repeatedly have concluded that the devastating properties of chemicals as arms 
still leave American forces threatened. Indeed, midway through the U.S. 
chemical defenses buildup, the General Accounting Office concluded bluntly in 
1986 that American defenses were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Among those the government auditors found to be particularly at risk: Navy 
ships at sea and command posts on the ground -- and the rapid-deployment troops 
like the 82nd Airborne, operating in the open with only light equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said Wednesday that each of the U.S. soldiers dispatched to 
the Middle East is carrying a Mark I combat kit containing atropine, an 
injectable common drug that serves as an antidote to the effects of nerve gas 
-- perhaps Hussein's most potent threat. 
</P>
<P>
The needle-ready kit, worn strapped tight across the thigh, is designed to 
provide emergency aid to a soldier who comes under surprise nerve gas attack. A 
hard slap to the thigh sends atropine into the victim's system, serving as a 
muscle relaxant. 
</P>
<P>
They also carry so-called MOPP kits -- the heavy charcoal-lined suits whose 
mask and head-to-toe cover provide the only guarantee of safety against a 
chemical attack. An acronym for military operational personnel protection, MOPP 
suits are "hot as blazes" in even temperate heat, according to former a soldier 
who has worn them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to wear one in a desert situation," the former soldier said, "I 
don't think you could last more than an hour." 
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, the "ready brigade" of some 4,000 paratroopers 
from the 82nd Airborne also includes a special company designed to combat the 
effects of chemical war. The unit carries special devices to detect the 
presence of poison gases and would seek to decontaminate men and their 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The desert heat would also hamper an Iraqi chemical attack, because poison 
agents would dissipate more quickly. But analysts said that the hot-weather 
burden on American ground troops would be far more severe, in part because 
Hussein could overcome evaporation by increasing his chemical attack. 
</P>
<P>
CIA estimates recently provided to Congress show that Iraq has amassed a vast 
stockpile containing as much as several thousand tons of chemical weapons, 
including both nerve and mustard gas. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi forces used the chemicals with increasingly devastating effect in its 
eight-year war with Iran, escalating from purely defensive use of the weapons 
to gas-bombings and shellings to open the way for major ground attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Nerve gas, generally used in aerosol form, attacks the nervous system of its 
victims by inhibiting the normal action of a body enzyme. Difficult to detect, 
it poses severe dangers from inhalation and from contact. In severe cases it 
results in convulsion, coma and -- unless properly treated -- death. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard gas is a liquid agent whose blistering power and other horrors became 
part of the numbing history of World War I. With effects that can last for 
hours, it has no antidote other than staying out of its way. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hussein has used explosives and poison gases on civilians, American 
analysts expressed uncertainty about where he might aim an anti-American 
chemical attack. 
</P>
<P>
And because U.S. chemical weapons already may have been shipped to the region 
-- and the United States, unlike Iran, also maintains potentially overpowering 
weaponry -- many of the analysts expressed doubt as to whether Hussein would 
take the risk of opening a chemical war. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not convinced that Saddam Hussein is going to use chemical weapons," said 
Elisa Harris, a Brookings Institution expert. "He must recognize that that 
would be suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
But the experts said it was conceivable that the Iraqi leader might use gas, 
firing bombs or shells at ground troops or attacking ships at sea. 
</P>
<P>
They said such an overarching threat could impose severe limits to U.S. forces, 
particularly on the desert floor, a world where blowing sand can wreak havoc on 
aircraft engines and 110-degree heat creates a need in man for six gallons of 
water a day. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to add the morale factor that chemical weapons seem to bring," said 
Steve Bowman, a congressional weapons expert with the Congressional Research 
Service. "It makes for a very high anxiety factor."

BUSH REJECTS APPEASEMENT AS 1ST U.S. FORCES LAND IN ARABIA;

<P>
President Bush said Wednesday that he sent U.S. fighting forces to Saudi Arabia 
because "America will stand by her friends," as combat aircraft and the first 
of what officials have said could be tens of thousands of troops took up 
defensive positions in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We must resist aggression or it will destroy our freedoms. Appeasement does 
not work," the President declared in a somber, early-morning speech to the 
nation just hours after the first elite U.S. Army commando units arrived in the 
Middle East kingdom to fend off a possible attack by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"A line has been drawn in the sand. The United States has taken a firm 
position," Bush said later. 
</P>
<P>
While declining to provide details of the size of the force they may eventually 
deploy, senior Pentagon officials sought to assure the nation they are 
dispatching sufficient troops, backed by some of the nation's most lethal 
weapons, to thwart any offensive by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"We will put in adequate forces for the mission," Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. The initial deployment was 
expected to be 4,000 troops, although officials have said the number ultimately 
could reach 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
The mission is to protect Saudi Arabia and U.S. oil interests from the 
powerful, battle-hardened Iraqi military units massed to the north on Saudi 
Arabia's border with Iraqi-overrun Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis, Powell said, "are not invincible, and they are not 10 feet tall." 
But he expressed concern that Iraq might resort to the use of dreaded chemical 
weapons. One U.S. official said satellite photographs taken Tuesday showed 
equipment that could contain chemical weapons being loaded on Iraqi aircraft. 
Powell said such a threat has been taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the use of chemical weapons "would be intolerable, and . . . it 
would be dealt with very, very severely." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bush nor Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would estimate how long the U.S. 
forces would be stationed in the tense region. As the first soldiers took up 
positions at Saudi air bases, however, one U.S. official noted: "There is a 
possibility of a long-term involvement." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden airlift of troops under cover of darkness and the rush of U.S. Air 
Force F-15 Eagles from bases in the eastern United States and Europe came six 
days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That lightning-like operation led U.S. 
officials, and leaders throughout the Middle East, to express deep alarm that 
Hussein would not stop at the Kuwaiti border in his quest to gain control of 
the wealth produced by some of the world's richest oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
The President's action, announced in a nationally broadcast speech from the 
Oval Office, drew expressions of support from senior Democrats and Republicans 
in Congress. They agreed that the threat of Iraqi control of world oil supplies 
justifies the commitment of U.S. troops and military hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) praised Bush for having "skillfully worked 
with other nations to isolate Iraq and apply maximum diplomatic and economic 
pressure to reverse Iraq's illegal seizure of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the President can count upon our support in this action," said 
Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the House of Representatives' 
third-ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
With Kuwait apparently sealed off to the West by more than 100,000 occupying 
Iraqi troops, military activities there remained to some degree a matter of 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sign of activity yet," said a U.S. official on an interagency task 
force monitoring developments in Kuwait. "We're a bit surprised. Every day that 
they don't react, we're closer to home." 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. troops taking up defensive positions at key posts in Saudi Arabia, 
said one Pentagon source, an attack could come "now -- in the next day or two 
-- or never." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence sources reported that additional Iraqi troops and weapons 
were being moved toward that nation's border with Kuwait. But they said there 
did not appear to be a major buildup of forces inside Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Hussein declared that Iraq had annexed Kuwait and called for Arab 
unity in the face of outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League planned to hold a summit today in Cairo, as U.S. officials 
continued to work behind the scenes to line up support among nations both in 
the region -- where Hussein is alternately feared and viewed as an Arab brother 
-- and throughout the rest of the world for a multinational display of military 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
The commitment of Egyptian troops, much favored by the United States, as well 
as units from Morocco, remained uncertain. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
denied reports in the United States that his country had agreed to send troops 
to join the multinational force. He said the Arabs should deal with the 
situation themselves rather than have "a solution forced on us by foreign 
powers." 
</P>
<P>
But a ranking Egyptian official indicated that the summit meeting in Cairo 
would provide a display of Arab unity that would allow Egypt to dispatch troops 
to Saudi Arabia with sufficient political support from other Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Ike Skelton (D-Mo.), who attended a congressional 
briefing by Defense Secretary Cheney, said troops from other countries would be 
joining the U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton said he did not know which nations would be part of the multinational 
force, but that he assumed several would be Arab countries. "Saudi Arabia will 
make the announcement," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Army units, along with Air Force fighters and three U.S. Navy 
aircraft carrier battle groups, moved into position to take up the brunt of the 
Middle East duties. 
</P>
<P>
With the 82nd Airborne Division's "ready brigade" digging in after a 16-hour 
flight from North Carolina, several more U.S. units remained prepared for rapid 
deployment. The 101st Airborne Assault Division, equipped with hundreds of 
attack helicopters, was ready for deployment from Ft. Campbell, Ky., and the 
24th Infantry Mechanized Division, based at Ft. Stewart, Ga., remained on alert 
for rapid departure, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, warplanes throughout the United States and Europe, including F-16s 
and F-111 fighter-bombers, were being prepared for deployment to Saudi air 
bases. And B-52 bomber units based in the United States were maintained on 
alert status for the long flights to the region. "One of our functions is going 
to be using aircraft to kill tanks," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) after a 
military briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force readied several C-5A airlift aircraft, the behemoth of the 
service's transport fleet, for the bulky equipment operated by the 24th and the 
101st Divisions. The planes could ferry hundreds of the Army's heaviest tanks 
and helicopters to the region in less than a day, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy sources said hospital ships were steaming toward the Persian Gulf from the 
Pacific Ocean. The aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its escorts of cruisers and 
destroyers were in the Red Sea, to the west of Saudi Arabia, and the carrier 
Independence and its battle group were in the Arabian Sea, just beyond the 
Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. In addition, the carrier Saratoga and 
the battleship Wisconsin were headed across the Atlantic toward the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Bush's decision won the tacit approval of Soviet leaders, but they 
shied away from any hint that their armed forces might join a possible blockade 
to enforce the international economic and military embargo on Iraq approved 
Monday by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Our navy is simply not equipped for this sort of operation," said an official 
of the Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee. "However, I 
have no doubt that many of our captains, just like in America, are wringing 
their hands with eagerness to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
Still, a U.S. diplomat reported that an "enormous number of contacts" were 
being made between American and Soviet colleagues to find ways to pressure Iraq 
to withdraw from Kuwait -- a reflection of superpower cooperation that has 
amazed some Washington officials as they seek an end to the first international 
crisis of the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is raising the specter of World War III," said one official involved in 
monitoring the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The massive military movements toward the troubled region, with the support of 
Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, represented a breakthrough for U.S. 
efforts to establish closer and more open ties there despite four decades of 
American support for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi acceptance of the U.S. role appeared to have been driven by its fear of 
Iraq and eased by a U.S. agreement to make an emergency sale of 15 F-15 jets to 
the Saudis. In the mid-1980s, Saudi Arabia purchased 12 of the sophisticated 
fighters but stationed them in the United States on a standby basis to replace 
planes as needed from an earlier purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Emergency Arms Sales Act, the White House may bypass Congress in 
order to rush arms to allies. 
</P>
<P>
One source, well informed on affairs in Saudi Arabia, said King Fahd had not 
yet asked for any further arms. But it was believed that he would soon seek 
additional weaponry, most likely 40 to 48 F-15s. Such aircraft were denied to 
Saudi Arabia in 1985 when the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee raised 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
At a midday news conference, Bush sought to lessen tensions caused by the 
detainment of 39 Americans in a Baghdad hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "I consider the protection of American life fundamental to my job 
and responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it has compiled an incomplete list of 1,468 Americans 
in Kuwait or Iraq who have been prevented from leaving despite sharp official 
protests by U.S. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq have managed to sneak over the 
borders, and U.S. diplomats in Baghdad have been allowed to visit with the 
Americans held in the hotel. They reported that the captives are in "good 
spirits." 
</P>
<P>
The President's deployment of troops left some family members in this country 
angry, as the tension appeared to escalate and with it the increased risk that 
Hussein could use the Americans as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a week in which the nation saw relatively little of the President 
-- save for brief comments to reporters as the frustration of the crisis grew 
-- Bush twice presented his case for the deployment during a space of three 
hours, first in a nationwide speech and then in a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his desk in the Oval Office at 6 a.m. PDT, Bush disclosed the 
deployment of the 82nd Airborne Division units and the fighter jets, "to assist 
the Saudi Arabian government in the defense of its homeland." 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States seeks "the immediate, unconditional and complete 
withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait," and restoration of the Kuwaiti 
government that was replaced by a "puppet regime" when Iraq invaded. 
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are high," he said, because the United States depends on imported 
oil for half of its oil supplies. Iraqi control over Kuwait, and the threat to 
Saudi Arabia -- both major oil producers -- could jeopardize America's economic 
independence, the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Nazi Germany's takeover of Europe 50 years ago, Bush said: "As was 
the case in the 1930s, we see in Saddam Hussein an aggressive dictator 
threatening his neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Discounting the Iraqi president's pledges first not to invade Kuwait and then 
to withdraw, Bush said, "His promises mean nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an American problem or a European problem or a Middle East 
problem," the President said. "It is the world's problem." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "Iraq may not stop using force to advance its ambitions. Iraq has 
massed an enormous war machine on the Saudi border, capable of initiating 
hostilities with little or no additional preparation. Given the Iraqi 
government's history of aggression against its own citizens as well as its 
neighbors, to assume Iraq will not attack again would be unwise and 
unrealistic."

Tumulty and Robin Wright contributed to this report.

<P>
WORLD MILITARY REACTION 
</P>
<P>
 The world at large has agreed to enforce economic sanctions against Iraq; many 
nations also froze assets of Iraq and Kuwait. Others, including United States, 
have gone further. Here's a military roundup: 
</P>
<P>
UNITED STATES: Sends combat aircraft and troops to region. 
</P>
<P>
SAUDI ARABIA: Will allow U.S. troops and warplanes to be deployed from its 
land. 
</P>
<P>
TURKEY: Expects U.S. request to use Turkish air bases as potential staging 
areas. Has stopped allowing Iraqi oil to be loaded on tankers. 
</P>
<P>
EGYPT: President Mubarak will host Arab summit today. "We are not preparing 
troops and there is no talk about this," he says. "But if we are asked to 
participate with Arab troops, I do not think Egypt would refuse." 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is only world leader to offer ships 
and planes for the force. Destroyer is already in Persian Gulf. Other members 
of 16-nation NATO military alliance and 12-nation European Community hold back 
on military commitments, for now. 
</P>
<P>
ITALY: Agrees to let bases be used to help facilitate transport of troops and 
equipment and for logistic support. 
</P>
<P>
SPAIN: Will allow United States to use four jointly operated military bases to 
support U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
WEST GERMANY: Signals readiness to allow the U.S. military to use American 
facilities in West Germany as a "basis for operations" for soldiers headed to 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
GREECE: Gives permission for nine U.S. support planes to pass through Greek 
airspace en route to Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE: Has two ships in Gulf of Oman and frigate with Exocet missiles en 
route. 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: Has offered no immediate military support. Anti-submarine ship 
and destroyer dispatched from Indian Ocean toward area, but only to "ensure 
safety of navigation of Soviet civilian vessels." 
</P>
<P>

STATE SAYS AIRLINES HELPED SHIPPERS AVOID PEST PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
CRACKDOWN: MEDFLIES AND OTHER INSECTS WERE UNDERCOUNTED AS A RESULT, 
AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
A group of Latin American air carriers has encouraged fruit distributors to 
delay their shipments to Los Angeles International Airport to avoid an 
intensive inspection program meant to determine whether pests, including the 
Medfly, are entering California via air cargo, agriculture authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our information is that the airlines called their shippers and said, 'If it 
doesn't have to come now, hold it,' " said Gera Curry, spokeswoman for the 
state Department of Food and Agriculture. "These inspections make for long 
lines and delays . . . so, it's an inconvenience to their customers." 
</P>
<P>
The air carriers' actions during a five-day "cargo inspection blitz" that ended 
Friday almost certainly resulted in an underestimation of the number of pests 
being brought into the country, said Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the 
state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of the cargo blitz were skewed because we have evidence that some 
of the airlines told their customers not to ship because this was the week the 
inspection was taking place," Siddiqui said after briefing reporters on 
progress in the Medfly eradication effort. 
</P>
<P>
Officials declined to name the airlines involved but said there was no evidence 
that U.S.-based air carriers had similarly moved to evade the inspections. The 
air carriers' efforts allegedly involved shipments from Mexico, Ecuador, 
Guatemala and El Salvador, among other Central and South American countries. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have long blamed Southern California's Medfly infestation on 
contaminated fruit being brought into the country by foreign travelers and 
commercial shippers. The intensive periodic inspections -- in which officials 
inspect 100% of fruit shipments and passenger luggage -- were ordered to 
determine the risk posed by undeclared agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Los Angeles and Orange County communities have been targeted for 
repeated malathion spraying to wipe out the infestation, which poses a threat 
to California's $16-billion agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties for possessing, propagating, processing or selling a plant or other 
imported items subject to quarantine include fines of up to $10,000 per 
violation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials said there is no law that prevents shippers or others from 
circumventing the inspections by notifying their clients that their produce may 
be subject to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the state plans no specific action beyond educating the air 
carriers "about cooperation in pest control, and we have every intention of 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Cargo representatives for Ecuatoriana Airline and TACA International Airlines, 
one of the largest carriers flying out of Guatemala, said they had no knowledge 
of any of their shippers being warned about the recent inspection. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Ruiz, cargo representative for TACA, said: "We obviously place 
calls to all our clients if it is (an inspection) that will be with us for a 
long time. . . . This blitz lasted only a week and there weren't many 
perishables being sent during that time. We didn't find the need to call them 
(shippers) and let them know." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wright, assistant regional director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
said his agency was concerned but generally powerless to stop air carriers from 
avoiding such inspections, which have cost the state $225,000 since they began 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
"My preference would be that they not inform their shippers or passengers when 
we have an inspection blitz," Wright said. "But I can't stop them from 
informing cargo shippers this is going on." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to evading the inspections, Siddiqui said, officials identified at 
least one case in which an air package containing agricultural products 
disappeared after being "placed on hold with orders that it not be removed" 
from the premises. "Our inspectors went back and found that the cargo was 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
"We want the United States Department of Agriculture to investigate this case," 
said Siddiqui, who declined to name the carrier involved. "First, we have to 
see if there was a violation on the part of the airline or personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the air carriers' actions, officials reported that the five-day 
inspection of 1,387 shipments -- 18 of them mislabeled or undeclared -- from 44 
countries and the state of Hawaii turned up a disturbing variety of potentially 
dangerous pests and diseases entering California through international 
terminals in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Findings included 50 pounds of lychee fruit flown from Taiwan via Canada that 
was infested with larvae from the family of insects that includes the Medfly 
and the Mexican and Oriental fruit flies, authorities said. The larvae were too 
young to positively identify as Medflies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a shipment of dried lemons from Kuwait was destroyed after 
inspectors found they were infected with citrus canker. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection also turned up unanticipated cargo including a quantity of 
suspicious white powder that was handed over to U.S. Customs officials, and "a 
shipment of fraudulent university diplomas," Siddiqui said. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, Curry said, state agriculture inspectors will "go in quickly and 
unannounced following the lead of the U.S. Customs Service." 
</P>
<P>
"That will not allow for advance notice or special preparations, which could 
skew the results and effectiveness of our inspection efforts," Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, state agriculture authorities inspected the baggage of 34,393 
passengers at the airport between July 29 and Aug. 4. That operation 
intercepted 148 pests -- including 14 Mexican fruit flies -- on fruit shipments 
such as mangoes, avocados, peaches and plums that may be hosts for the pests. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most damaging insect pests in the world, a female Medfly can lay up 
to 300 eggs in a lifetime, which hatch into maggots that feed on the fruit pulp 
surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit spoils and drops to the ground, enabling the larvae to enter the 
soil. About eight days later, adult flies emerge and reach sexual maturity in 
four to five days.

2 INSURERS ORDERED TO MAKE REBATES; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 103: GILLESPIE TELLS SAFECO AND CALIFORNIA STATE AUTOMOBILE ASSN. 
TO RETURN PART OF THEIR 1989 PREMIUMS. THE COMPANIES WILL FIGHT THE MOVE.

Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie on Wednesday notified two companies 
that they will be asked to return $133 million in 1989 premiums to customers in 
what could provide the basis for a court test of her provisions for rate 
rollbacks called for under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Safeco was told to rebate $41 million, or about 11% of its premiums. The 
California State Automobile Assn. was told to rebate $92 million, or about 7% 
of its premiums. The companies will have the chance at a Sept. 17 departmental 
hearing to contest the amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both companies challenged the rebates as unjust and said they 
will go to court if the amounts stand as announced. Most California insurers 
have been fighting for two years to avoid rebating any money to customers as 
mandated by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action was based on Gillespie's decision that any company found to 
have had profits exceeding 11.2% in 1989 premiums in auto, homeowner, 
commercial and other lines combined must rebate the difference to its 
customers, up to a maximum of 20% of the total premium. 
</P>
<P>
In Safeco's case, a customer who paid $1,000 in 1989 for auto insurance would 
get back approximately $110 under Wednesday's ruling. A California State 
Automobile Assn. customer who had paid $1,000 would get about $70 back. The 
companies will also be required to add 10% annual interest on the sums owed 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies have objected that the 11.2% standard is too low. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year ago, Gillespie tried to order rollbacks and rebates, notifying 
seven companies that they should return $305.3 million to their customers and 
scheduling hearings on her ruling. But she had to abandon those plans after 
insurers and consumers raised a number of procedural and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie then held hearings for more than four months on the concerns and is 
only now resuming her rollback efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gillespie was stymied Wednesday in her efforts to hold hearings on 
future rates the companies can charge. The administrative hearing judge she had 
selected removed himself three hours after the first day of proceedings rather 
than file a financial statement listing payments he had received from insurance 
companies for hearing cases as a retired "rent-a-judge." 
</P>
<P>
James Scott, who formerly sat on the state Court of Appeal in San Francisco, 
disqualified himself in response to a conflict-of-interest challenge from Atty. 
Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. Scott said he had no records listing payments he 
received last year and that it would be too difficult to find the information. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and various consumer groups have been filing challenges to 
Gillespie in an effort to stop the hearings on future rates. Gillespie has 
ruled that the companies should be granted up to 19% annual rates of return in 
the future. Under Proposition 103, the commissioner must give prior approval 
for a wide range of insurance rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie named Frank Britt, a retired administrative hearing judge from Los 
Angeles, to replace Scott. Although the hearing is to resume today, Britt may 
be asked to make preliminary procedural decisions that could force a lengthy 
delay. The hearings on future rates involve State Farm, Safeco and Fireman's 
Fund. Safeco and State Farm are simply asking the commissioner to validate 
their present rates, but Fireman's Fund is asking for a 24% increase in 
personal auto insurance and other increases in commercial policies. 
</P>
<P>
A State Farm representative said that if the companies' present rates are 
validated, no rebates will be ordered for 1989 premiums.

BOY, 8, KILLED ON FREEWAY NEAR BORDER CHECKPOINT

An 8-year-old boy believed to have been an undocumented immigrant from Mexico 
en route to family in Orange County was struck by a car and killed along 
Interstate 5 north of the San Clemente border checkpoint early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He was run down about 12:15 a.m. as he and six others, including his mother and 
three siblings, were crossing the busy freeway in the early-morning darkness, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was identified as Constantino Loreto Marin, a resident of the Mexican 
Pacific Coast city of Acapulco. He was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
He was the 10th pedestrian believed to have been an undocumented Mexican 
immigrant to be struck and killed this year along a 10-mile stretch of 
Interstate 5 in northern San Diego County, where illegal immigrants finding 
their way north frequently cross the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, 33 pedestrians believed 
to have been undocumented immigrants have been killed along Interstate 5 in 
that area. 
</P>
<P>
All apparently were trying to bypass inspection at the U.S. Border Patrol 
checkpoint on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
Undocumented immigrants heading toward the Los Angeles area from the Mexican 
border have long attempted to walk around the checkpoint, subjecting themselves 
to the hazards of fast-moving freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Women and children often are the most vulnerable, officials say, because they 
cross the roadways more slowly. U.S. immigration authorities say more and more 
women and children are entering the United States illegally from Mexico, often 
seeking to reunite with husbands and fathers who have recently become legal 
under the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"This just shows how much desperation there is out there," said Roberto 
Martinez, an immigrant-rights activist in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims are from rural areas and are unaccustomed to high-speed 
freeways. In addition, they reportedly have often been traveling for hours and 
are exhausted by the time they try to cross the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has placed flashing signs along 
Interstate 5 warning motorists of the potential presence of pedestrians, but 
the deaths have continued to mount. 
</P>
<P>
The boy killed early Wednesday was believed to have been en route to the 
Anaheim-area home of relatives, according to the Mexican consul general in San 
Diego. However, his precise destination and the identity of his family members 
in the United States were not known, said Marcela Merino, a Mexican consular 
official in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He was hit by a rented 1990 Chevrolet Corsica driven by Sharon K. Frisby of 
Mesa, Ariz., according to Stephen Tomasiak, a traffic officer with the CHP in 
Oceanside. The vehicle was traveling about 60 miles an hour. The driver was not 
cited because she could not have avoided the accident, the CHP said.

LEGLESS PEACE ACTIVIST SAYS AWARD NEAR

Anti-war activist S. Brian Willson and his lawyers say the federal government 
has tentatively agreed to pay $920,000 to settle a lawsuit filed after a Navy 
weapons train hit Willson and severed his legs during a 1987 protest. 
</P>
<P>
William McGivern, the U.S. attorney in San Francisco, said a settlement 
proposal has been sent to Justice Department officials for approval, but that a 
court order prohibited him from saying anything further. A lawyer for three 
train crew members also named in the suit, however, issued a statement saying 
the railroad workers would pay no money under the tentative agreement and that 
"the settlement is being entirely paid by the . . . United States." 
</P>
<P>
According to Willson and his lawyers, the proposed settlement is proof that the 
government acknowledges it was reckless in dealing with the protesters on Sept. 
1, 1987. Some of the 40 protesters that day, including Willson, tried to block 
arms shipments by sitting on railroad tracks in the path of a train leaving the 
Concord Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
"It should send a message out that you can't use deadly force against peaceful 
protesters," said Tom Steel, Willson's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Willson, a former Air Force captain who served in the Vietnam War, said he 
would use the settlement money to help support his efforts to promote peace 
through speeches, demonstrations and civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it a bittersweet victory," said Willson, 49, who walks on 
artificial legs. "It's a fairly significant settlement, but the Concord Naval 
Weapons Station and other installations are still sending weapons to the Third 
World." 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys, however, stressed there is no final agreement yet. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are allowed to say is that there is a settlement in process and it has 
been sent to the Department of Justice for approval," McGivern said. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for Willson, his wife and three other protesters who sued the 
government said $920,000 would be paid in a single cash payment, with most of 
it going to Willson and his wife, Holley Rauen. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Meyer, Rauen's attorney, said the activists had asked for more than $3 
million in the 1988 lawsuit, which claimed the federal government and train 
crew violated the protesters' civil rights and caused personal injuries. 
Willson was the only protester seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Since the incident, anti-war protesters have maintained a 24-hour-a-day vigil 
at the weapons depot, which ships between 60,000 and 120,000 tons of munitions 
each year to U.S. forces and allies, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Willson's announcement of a tentative settlement comes one month before the 
case was due to be heard in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Earlier this 
year, a federal judge dismissed a suit by three of the train crewmen, who 
blamed Willson for psychological damage and loss of wages they suffered after 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham said Willson did not plan to cause the 
railroad workers any distress, because he assumed the train would stop before 
hitting him. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, the Navy decided not to suspend the train's crew, citing 
Willson's failure to get out of the way as a "mitigating factor." Walnut Creek 
attorney William Kolin, who represented the three crew members, said Wednesday 
that his clients "feel that Mr. Willson's injuries were brought about by his 
voluntary act of sitting on the railroad tracks in full view of the oncoming 
munitions train." 
</P>
<P>
Willson and the protesters' lawyers have claimed that the train was going three 
times the 5 m.p.h. speed limit as it crossed a road cutting through the Navy 
base. Railroad operations manager Edward Hubbard and Navy base security 
officers knew the protesters were on the tracks, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crime, you know. It wasn't an accident," said Willson, calling the 
incident an extension of U.S. policy in war-torn parts of Central America. "It 
was just a matter of bringing the war home a bit."

EMPLOYEES' HEALTH PLAN PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: BUSINESS OWNERS WOULD HAVE THREE YEARS TO SUPPLY COVERAGE. THOSE 
UNABLE TO MEET THE GOAL WOULD BE TAXED TO FUND A PRIVATE PROGRAM.

Seeking to jump-start stalled negotiations over how to provide health coverage 
for the uninsured, a key lawmaker Wednesday suggested a plan that would give 
the business community three years to reduce by 90% the number of working 
Californians who lack medical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
If that goal is not reached, a so-called "play or pay" system would be 
triggered under which businesses would be required to provide insurance for 
their employees or pay a payroll tax to the state. Proceeds from the tax would 
go into a fund to purchase private insurance for all Californians who could not 
obtain it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes a provision that would establish state regulation of 
hospital rates and doctors' fees if increases in those costs exceeded a 
targeted level. No specific target was mentioned in Wednesday's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Burt Margolin, a Los Angeles Democrat who has led six months of 
talks on the issue, said he hoped the proposal would be the starting point for 
three weeks of negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise before the 
Legislature's scheduled Aug. 31 adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin acknowledged that his maneuver means there is almost no chance that 
the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian will enact a bill this year that 
would require all businesses to provide insurance for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to have any chance at all of completing a deal, we needed a 
document to set us on a fast track toward negotiating out the differences among 
the various parties on this issue," Margolin said. "The notion of a voluntary 
effort is probably going to be required to produce a bill that the governor can 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian administration officials working on the health insurance issue could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be considered by an Assembly-Senate conference committee 
headed by Margolin that has an unusually high-powered membership, including the 
Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate, the Assembly Republican 
leader, and the Democratic chairman of the Assembly Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Margolin plan is expected to encounter stiff opposition from Assembly 
Republicans. One conference committee member, Assembly Republican Leader Ross 
Johnson of La Habra, has said he will not agree to any program that requires 
businesses to provide insurance for their workers. A Johnson aide said 
Wednesday that the lawmaker has not changed his position. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Turner, Johnson's press secretary, said Margolin's plan would almost 
certainly trigger an 8% payroll tax at the end of three years because it is 
unlikely that businesses could insure the required number of workers -- about 
2.5 million -- in that short a time. Turner said Johnson also opposes state 
regulation of medical care rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing just ignores market forces completely," Turner said. "We don't 
think that this is a rational approach to the issue of health care." 
</P>
<P>
The concept, however, has received the tentative support of the Los Angeles 
Area Chamber of Commerce, a key business group. The chairman of the chamber's 
health issues committee said in a letter to Margolin that the chamber is 
"supportive of the direction" taken in the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes provisions designed to make health coverage more affordable 
by, among other things, curbing the current insurance industry practice of 
basing premiums on the health history of each company's workers. This method, 
known as "experience rating," has prompted huge price increases for small 
businesses that have a single worker afflicted by a serious disease. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also envisions containing medical costs by making the industry 
more competitive. This would be done by making more information available about 
doctor and hospital treatment practices and providing incentives for companies 
to buy the cheapest possible coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses also would be eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of 
providing insurance.

YELTSIN PLEDGES TO RESIGN IF HIS MARKET PROGRAM FAILS; 
</P>
<P>
RUSSIA: THE REPUBLIC'S PRESIDENT GIVES HIMSELF A 3-YEAR DEADLINE TO IMPLEMENT 
THE ECONOMIC PLAN.

<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, was quoted Wednesday as 
saying he will resign in three years if by then he has not carried out his 
radical program to bring a market economy to Russia, the largest of the Soviet 
Union's 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Yeltsin, who is touring the republic 
in an effort to build support for his economic policies and investigate local 
grievances, as saying in an interview: 
</P>
<P>
"I shall resign if people do not trust me and if we do not implement our 
program within the next three years." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who recently quit the Soviet Communist Party, made it clear that he 
does not think that quitting as president of Russia will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm an optimist," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's 500-day program to improve the economy, made public last month, calls 
for the introduction of private property and foreign investment. Inefficient 
enterprises would be closed or merged with more successful enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The final stage envisions the deregulation of prices and the elimination of all 
state subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's plan is more radical than that of Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, but in an apparent compromise, the leaders agreed last week that a 
group of economists under their guidance should work out unified guidelines for 
a future market economy. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, Yeltsin, a populist who has often 
been called Gorbachev's principal rival on the left, appeared to be distancing 
himself from Gorbachev's policies. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kremlin's economic blockade of Lithuania, lifted last month 
when the maverick republic agreed to suspend its declaration of independence, 
was a "big political blunder." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said a treaty now being drafted by Latvia and the Russian republic will 
be an "equal agreement under two sovereign states," and he criticized Gorbachev 
for interpreting such bilateral agreements between republics as threats to the 
unity of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral talks between Soviet republics are a sign of their growing 
independence from the center. Traditionally, the outlying republics negotiate 
only with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also confirmed that Maj. Vladimir Lopatin, a reformer, is likely to be 
appointed head of the new Russian Committee for Public Security, a parallel 
organization to the KGB.

ARMY READY TO TAKE CONTROL, BHUTTO CHARGES

In a strongly worded attack, Benazir Bhutto charged Wednesday that powerful 
army generals had forced her ouster as prime minister, and she warned that the 
army will "take over" within a few weeks, ending Pakistan's brief experiment 
with democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The military is running the show," Bhutto told reporters here two days after 
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan abruptly dismissed her 20-month-old government, 
dissolved the National Assembly and declared a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"The caretaker government is temporary," Bhutto said at a news conference. 
"Within a few weeks, the army will take over." 
</P>
<P>
Military and government officials denied the charges and insisted that general 
elections will be held Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
But government officials said Bhutto, her mother, her husband and about 30 
close aides and officials would be barred from leaving the country pending 
possible criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency gives the government wide-ranging powers of detention, 
and some of Bhutto's supporters reportedly went into hiding to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, an opposition leader who was named interim prime 
minister, indicated that special courts may be created to investigate 
persistent allegations of corruption leveled against key Bhutto supporters and 
members of her family and Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's aides said the investigations may be used to prevent the 37-year-old 
Harvard- and Oxford-educated former leader and her Pakistan People's Party from 
taking part in the October elections. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said Bhutto, while personally honest, turned a blind eye to corruption 
and nepotism. Her husband, businessman Asif Ali Zardari, was widely known as 
"Mr. 10%" for alleged profiteering from government contracts. She also 
appointed her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, as a senior Cabinet minister. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bhutto offered no proof, she said the army had threatened to impose 
martial law if she were not fired. 
</P>
<P>
"An illegal, undemocratic and unconstitutional step against me has been taken 
under pressure of military intelligence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While in office, Bhutto tried to smooth over differences with the army and its 
powerful chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg. 
</P>
<P>
She gave the army a broad say in foreign policy decisions particularly 
regarding Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
She said Wednesday, however, that "major differences" developed with Gen. Beg 
in May, apparently over the army's demands to crack down on urban violence in 
Sind province, her home and political power base. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto said she will not give the army "any pretext to postpone the elections," 
but added her belief that the army would interfere if it appeared that her 
party might win.

REBELS FREE FOREIGNERS IN LIBERIA;

CIVIL WAR: A WEST AFRICAN FORCE PREPARES TO GO TO THE COUNTRY TO ENFORCE A

One of the two rebel forces besieging Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, 
Wednesday freed a group of foreigners, including an American, who had been 
seized in an attempt to provoke foreign intervention in the civil war there. 
</P>
<P>
It was not made clear how many foreigners had been held by the rebel faction, 
headed by Prince Johnson, but a spokesman at the British Foreign Office 
announced in London that its embassy in Monrovia indicated that all were now 
free. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the foreigners were on the way to downtown Monrovia and "not 
in our hands." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Johnson had exhibited eight foreigners seized at a resort hotel and 
told reporters: "What this country really needs is the peaceful intervention of 
the United States (or other African nations). If they don't intervene, I will 
attack the American Marines." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to a detachment of about 200 Marines who were put ashore Sunday to 
oversee the evacuation from Monrovia of Americans and other foreign nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five West African nations began organizing a joint force to go into 
Liberia and enforce a cease-fire on the two rebel factions and the government 
forces of President Samuel K. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
The mission was approved Tuesday by the leaders of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, 
Gambia and Sierra Leone, who were concerned that the war was turning Liberia 
into a "slaughterhouse," in the words of Dawda Jawara, president of Gambia and 
chairman of the Economic Community of West African States. The joint force will 
be commanded by a Ghanaian with a Guinean deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news service reported that the force will have 2,500 men and will 
arrive in Liberia in 10 days. An armed forces spokesman in Accra, Ghana, said 
that country will contribute 1,000 troops, according to Reuters, which also 
reported that Nigeria will send 700 men, Guinea 550, Sierra Leone 350 and 
Gambia 105. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, head of the larger rebel force, has about 10,000 men behind him 
and has said he intends to oppose any intervening force. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was still some confusion about the number of foreigners seized 
by Johnson's men, estimates have ranged up to 22. At Johnson's news conference 
at his headquarters outside Monrovia, he identified only the eight, among them 
Chris Mendes, who is said to be a mining engineer from Sacramento. The others 
were three Britons, two Germans, a Dutchman and an Argentine. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials in Beirut told the Associated Press there were 10 Lebanese 
in the group. 
</P>
<P>
There is a substantial number of Europeans engaged in mining and timber in 
Liberia. Monrovia also has a large Lebanese community, which dominates commerce 
and trading there as in other West African countries. 
</P>
<P>
Doe, who seized power in a coup in April, 1980, and claimed the presidency 
after a fraudulent election in 1985, remained besieged in his Monrovia mansion 
as scattered fighting continued throughout the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The rebellion began last Christmas Eve, when Taylor, a former Cabinet minister 
under Doe, entered Liberia from Ivory Coast with a handful of men. He relied 
for recruits on members of the Gio and Mano tribes, who resented what they see 
as Doe's favoritism on behalf of his own Krahn tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the fighting took on a tribal character, as Taylor's and Doe's men 
inflicted heavy casualties on civilians in the rival tribal groups. Taylor is 
neither Gio nor Mano, tracing his lineage largely from the freed American 
slaves who established Liberia as an independent country in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson split his faction from Taylor's National Patriotic Front in February 
and reached the center of Monrovia first, about a month ago. Since then, he and 
Taylor have spent as much time fighting each other as the government. 
Meanwhile, Monrovia's water and power supplies have been cut off for a month, 
and food is becoming scarce in the capital.

A Swiss Red Cross worker who had been held hostage in Lebanon for 10 months was 
freed Wednesday and handed over to Swiss authorities, officials and witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they saw Emanuel Christen being handed to Swiss authorities 
shortly after midnight in front of the Syrian Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Christen, 33, was kidnaped Oct. 6, 1989, along with fellow Red Cross worker 
Elio Erriquez, 24. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said in a statement 
Wednesday that he had been freed. The Syrian Foreign Ministry and Red Cross in 
Geneva confirmed the release. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Christen was handed to 
Swiss Charge d'Affaires Fritz Kuehni and that he was then driven to the Swiss 
Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The statement from the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads did not explain why 
only one of the Swiss men was released. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first time since their abductions that a group had claimed to hold 
Christen and Erriquez. 
</P>
<P>
"After we have promised yesterday night to release the two delegates of the 
International Red Cross in Lebanon within 24 hours, one of them, Emanuel 
Christen, has been set free and handed over to a representative of Brig. Gen. 
Ghazi Kenaan at 6 p.m. this evening," said the statement, handwritten in 
Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
Kenaan is the chief of Syrian army intelligence in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Christen and Erriquez were abducted outside an artificial limbs center in 
Sidon, a port city 25 miles south of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Sidon had blamed their abduction on the Libyan-financed Revolutionary 
Council of Fatah, led by Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. That group 
denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
A statement Tuesday said that the decision to free the Red Cross captives was 
made in response to the wishes of Syrian President Hafez Assad, Libyan leader 
Moammar Kadafi and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the group had guarantees that their demands would be 
met, but it did not specify what those were. 
</P>
<P>
Six Americans are still among hostages held in Lebanon.

The deployment of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia has bypassed Israel, even though 
Israel is the United States' principal strategic ally in the Middle East, but 
officials here said Wednesday that Israel stands willing and ready to help the 
U.S. effort behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials in Jerusalem and Washington agree that to move U.S. military 
forces through here would not be in the best interests of either country, and 
that the Jewish state should keep a low profile in the present crisis, military 
sources indicated that Israel is prepared to provide whatever assistance the 
United States wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"True, we have a strategic relationship," a source close to the military said, 
"but we both know -- and the Arabs know -- that this is not the time for Israel 
to come to America's assistance in Saudi Arabia. If they really need our help, 
they can count on us." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Israeli officials are aware of the irony in the situation: The United 
States, despite its massive military support for Israel over the years, cannot 
call on Jerusalem for direct help. 
</P>
<P>
And Israelis are fully aware of the potential for criticism that although the 
United States helps Israel when it is in trouble, Israel cannot do the same for 
the United States -- and that as a consequence the relationship is something of 
a one-way street. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Steinberg, a professor of strategic studies at Israel's Bar-Ilan 
University, said: "The problems of this relationship have always been well 
understood privately. We realize how sensitive it would be for the Saudis if 
the United States were to stage forces through Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Alpher, deputy head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel 
Aviv University, said: "The fact that we can't participate in operations 
against an Arab state with the U.S. has been clear for some time. The U.S. 
knows that it can rely on us, but under the present circumstances Washington is 
saying they'd rather not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Israelis realize that the U.S. has political interests in the Arab 
world and that calling on us for help at this point would only be an 
embarrassment. Washington is having enough difficulty lining up support among 
the Arab states." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials point out, however, that if they cannot offer military 
facilities, they can help in other ways -- and are doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily they are providing a wide range of tactical intelligence about 
developments in the Persian Gulf region. They have been doing this ever since 
Iraq began its buildup against Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel has very good human intelligence sources in the gulf," a Western 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Other forms of assistance, military sources said, could include an early 
warning of any hostile action against ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israelis would like to see the United States rely on Israeli hospitals for 
emergency medical treatment of any casualties suffered in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"When the U.S. Marines were blown up in Beirut in 1983," an Israeli specialist 
said, "we would have liked to see them helicoptered to our hospitals 30 minutes 
away, where we specialize in treating such cases. Instead, they were flown all 
the way back to Ramstein (Air Base) in Germany, and some Marines who died might 
have been saved." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, a former chief of intelligence, said: "We 
understand the delicate situation the United States faces. It would be 
diplomatically wrong to ask us to help, though Israel could provide much. We 
are ready to assist the United States in whatever way it needs, though right 
now the possibility of it asking us for help is very unlikely."

IRAQ'S CHEMICAL ARMS: EASILY CONCOCTED AND DEADLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The chemical weapons stockpiled by Iraq can wreak havoc on the human body. 
Extremely toxic even when inhaled in relatively small amounts, chemical weapons 
unleash devastating effects ranging from severe eye, lung and skin burns to 
virtually immediate death. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, such weapons, which include nerve agents, cyanide and mustard gas, 
can be easily concocted in a makeshift laboratory using formulas from a 
chemistry textbook. Also, the dramatic effectiveness of chemical weaponry makes 
it almost impossible to effectively defend against, said Dr. Jane Orient, an 
internist at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is generally believed to have used nerve agents and mustard gas during the 
last years of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and against Kurds in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard gas can burn and blisters whatever it touches, said Gregory A. 
Thompson, director of the Drug Information Service at the USC Medical Center. 
When inhaled in large enough quantities, however, it can cause death within 24 
to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Victims' blistered lungs fill with fluid and they essentially drown, he 
explained. For some others who survive initially, the gas can act as a poison, 
typically causing lethal damage to DNA -- the blueprint of life -- contained in 
cells. Victims die within four to six weeks as their immune systems become 
severely suppressed and fail to fight infection. 
</P>
<P>
Cyanide, which is lethal in smaller doses than mustard gas, works by 
interfering with the transport of oxygen in the blood stream, and victims 
suffocate in a matter of minutes, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nerve agents are probably the most feared of all chemical weapons because they 
are deadly even at extremely small doses, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Inhalation of a drop of nerve agent the size of a pin point is a sufficient 
amount to kill," he said. The agents essentially overstimulate the nervous 
system, leading to convulsions, blindness, unconsciousness and, ultimately, 
death from respiratory failure. 
</P>
<P>
One type of nerve agent, VX, remains toxic for several weeks after it is 
dispersed into the environment, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers are able to protect themselves from chemical warfare by wearing gas 
masks and heavy, burdensome body gear. While offering sufficient protection 
against lethal chemicals, the bodysuits often prevent effective military 
combat, Orient said. Each U.S. soldier also carries three injectors of 
atropine, an antidote to nerve agents that can be self-administered through 
protective clothing.

25 REFUGEES TAKE LONG ROUTE OUT;

ESCAPE: THEY TELL OF OMINOUS ACTIONS BY REGIME IN BAGHDAD.

AMMAN, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trickle of relieved Westerners fleeing Iraq reached Jordan on Wednesday 
carrying tales of uncertainty about the status of foreigners left behind. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 travelers, most of them British citizens, arrived in Amman after a 
long and dusty 10-hour drive from Baghdad. None could confirm reports that Iraq 
had turned back a convoy of foreigners trying to leave overland during the day. 
</P>
<P>
But they described ominous actions on the part of the Iraqi government that 
appeared designed to restrict the movements of foreigners in Baghdad -- in 
particular, groups of travelers brought there from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several travelers said that three hotels -- the Palestine, the Rashid and the 
Melia -- have been cleared of guests to make way for the newcomers from Kuwait, 
which Iraq invaded last Thursday. Telephones were cut off in the three hotels, 
and the arrivals were segregated by nationality on different floors. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were moved out of our hotel to make way," recalled John Gai, a Swiss 
engineer, "I asked the soldiers why. They said that it was not the time to 
ask." 
</P>
<P>
As tensions have grown between Iraq and the West, and especially the United 
States, over the Iraqi takeover of oil-rich Kuwait, fears have arisen that 
foreigners could become hostages in Iraq. About 500 Americans are in Iraq, U.S. 
officials say, and about another 3,000 were in Kuwait before the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Europeans and thousands of Asians and Arab citizens are also in 
Kuwait and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of the hostage-taking in Iran in the late 1970s and the continuing 
drama of hostages in Lebanon have a special hold on the American imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The travelers who reached Amman on Wednesday had been in contact with various 
diplomats in Iraq, some of whom had advised them not to try to leave the 
capital. The borders were closed, the diplomats had said. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the days wore on, some travelers decided to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard that some people had left for the frontier and had gotten through," 
said Martin Mathias, a German businessman. "We decided to go too. We took taxis 
to the border and then hitched rides in Jordanian taxis on the other side. 
Everything went well. The Iraqis were very kind to us." 
</P>
<P>
There is only one crossing point between Iraq and Jordan, along the single road 
that joins the two countries across Jordan's eastern panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
Since last week, visitors to Baghdad have been unable to pin down whether they 
are free to go. On Saturday, word reached some that Iraqi Airlines had arranged 
for shuttle buses to take foreigners across the border. But this turned out to 
be false. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to see, they told us the buses were for diplomats," said Johann 
Lundgren, an engineer from Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The travelers said that Baghdad appeared to be relatively calm, despite reports 
of a partial evacuation of women, children and the elderly. Some said they 
thought more soldiers were on the streets than usual. Gai, the Swiss engineer, 
said he was awakened by gunfire Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"But it turned out someone was celebrating a national holiday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqis were taking the crisis largely in stride, some of the Westerners said. 
"A few friends told me, 'This is the second war for us. We have been through it 
all before,' " Gai said. The first war referred to was the bloody eight-year 
conflict with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
For at least one visitor to Baghdad, simple luck played a role in his getting 
away. Brian Hume, a businessman, had been in Baghdad for a week when the 
invasion of Kuwait took place. He learned of the trouble while watching TV in a 
small hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"When the news came across, the manager of the hotel turned the television 
off," Hume, 52, recalled. "I don't think they wanted outsiders to know." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hume and his partner, Mohammed Musa, saw a leaflet ordering 
women, children and the elderly to flee the capital. The pair decided to leave 
and visit a business associate in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the message was pretty clear. It was time to take a weekend away," 
Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
When both returned Monday, they found their business was disrupted by peculiar 
problems: It was impossible to make a long-distance phone call. A trip they 
planned to make to Kuwait was derailed because suddenly Kuwaiti currency had 
been devalued steeply. 
</P>
<P>
With nothing to do, Hume and Musa, who is a Jordanian, decided to catch a taxi 
to the border. They left at 1 a.m. Tuesday and got to the border at 7:30 in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I thought anything was strange was when an Arab came up to me at 
the border and told me that foreigners could not leave. But my passport had 
been stamped in only 15 minutes. I said, 'I'm leaving,' " Hume told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in Amman on Tuesday afternoon, he was greeted as a hero. 
"People came up to me and said how lucky I was. It was the first time I 
realized I should have been nervous. In Baghdad, I didn't think there was any 
trouble. I hadn't even called my embassy. I guess ignorance is bliss."

STRATEGY: BAKER COMMENDS TURKEY FOR CLOSING IRAQI PIPELINE AND FREEZING KUWAITI 
ASSETS. HE HINTS HE WILL ASK ANKARA TO PLAY A GREATER ROLE.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, flying to enlist the Turkish government 
in a growing drive against Iraq, announced Wednesday that the United States is 
contacting Syria and Iran about the possibility of cooperating in the global 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters on his way to a refueling stop at this base in the 
Azores, Baker said he will dispatch Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly to 
Syria to explore with President Hafez Assad the possibility of U.S.-Syrian 
action against Iraq, long a bitter rival of the government in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said that the United States has contacted Iran through its regular 
"third country" channel to discuss possible Iranian action. Iran and Iraq 
fought an inconclusive eight-year war that ended in a cease-fire two years ago 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of coordinated action with Syria, a radical Arab state with 
which Washington has long maintained the most chilly of relations, would be 
remarkable. And U.S. relations with Iran have been frozen since the 1979 
Islamic revolution, in which more than 50 Americans were seized and held 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.S. government has included Syria on its list of nations that 
support international terrorism. Iraq was removed from the list several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"John Kelly is going to Damascus in order to explore these questions with 
Syria," Baker said. "We're all aware of the history of Syrian-Iraqi relations." 
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival branches of the Arab Baath Party, and 
relations between the regimes have been tense for years. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who stressed Turkey's strategic importance as the site of the most 
sophisticated military bases bordering Iraq, is expected to assure Ankara today 
of firm military and financial support if it goes along. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is "very pleased" with Turkey's decision to stop the flow of Iraqi 
oil through a Turkish pipeline. But he hinted that he will ask Turkey to do 
even more when he meets with President Turgut Ozal and other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been particularly pleased with the forthright position that Turkey has 
taken," Baker said. "They have closed the Iraqi pipeline; they have frozen 
Kuwaiti assets. I am going to Turkey to ensure the continued close coordination 
between Turkey and the United States, to let the Turkish government know that 
they will continue to have our strong support and the support of the NATO 
alliance." 
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to emphasize NATO's doctrine of "collective defense," in 
which an attack on Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, would 
be considered to be an attack on all 16 members of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker declined to say if he would suggest the use of Turkish bases for 
possible military action against Iraq, he repeatedly emphasized Turkey's 
"strategic location" on the Iraqi border. 
</P>
<P>
A ranking State Department official aboard Baker's aircraft said Turkey would 
be compensated for giving up an estimated $5 million a day in revenue from 
operation of the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a way can be found to assure that Turkey will not suffer out-of-pocket 
financial losses as a result of what they might do," said the official, who 
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the U.S. government would not "foot the bill" for the Turkish 
aid, and he implied that most of it would come from billions of dollars in 
blocked Kuwaiti assets in the United States, Turkey and other countries. He 
said the action would "respond to the wishes of what we consider the legitimate 
government of Kuwait," which was deposed by the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who will go from Ankara to Brussels to brief NATO representatives 
Friday, said the crisis created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait marks the start 
of the post-Cold War era, in which the alliance, formed 43 years ago to counter 
the Soviet Union, must now face threats "from a different direction." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, NATO members have been reluctant to project allied power beyond 
Europe, although some member nations have joined in military action outside of 
the normal NATO area. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said he has spoken by telephone to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze on a daily basis since the crisis erupted last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union has been very supportive of our condemnation of the Iraqi 
aggression," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker said the arms and oil embargo on Iraq that was voted Monday by 
the U.N. Security Council has obtained so much support from the world's 
governments that it has become "somewhat self-enforcing." He said the level of 
compliance may preclude the necessity of mounting a naval blockade of the 
Persian Gulf to prevent Iraqi oil from getting through. 
</P>
<P>
The ranking official predicted that, following some initial hesitation, a 
substantial number of Arab states would join in the U.S.-led effort to isolate 
Iraq. He said at least six Arab nations have agreed to participate in the 
multinational force in Saudi Arabia.

ABA REVOKES SUPPORT FOR RIGHT TO ABORTION; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: SEVERAL BAR LEADERS HAD MOVED TO CANCEL THE 6-MONTH-OLD POLICY. THE 
ATTORNEYS' GROUP NOW HOLDS A NEUTRAL POSITION.

<P>
The American Bar Assn., bitterly split over the issue of abortion, voted 
Wednesday to revoke a 6-month-old policy of support for a woman's right to end 
a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 200 to 188, the organization's House of Delegates instead adopted 
a neutral stand on abortion. Under the new policy, the abortion issue is termed 
"extremely divisive" and "for the good of the association, (the ABA) will not 
adopt a policy supportive of a particular viewpoint with respect to . . . a 
decision to terminate pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates acknowledged that the ABA decision is a major setback 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
With support for the right to abortion on the wane in the Supreme Court and in 
some legislatures, women's rights advocates had hoped that the ABA would send a 
message that most of the nation's lawyers support the constitutional right to 
choose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In February, they had pushed the ABA's policy-making body to adopt, for the 
first time, an official statement of support for the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe 
vs. Wade ruling that had made abortion legal. At the ABA's midwinter meeting in 
Los Angeles, they won passage of an abortion rights resolution that endorsed 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
But their strategy backfired this week. 
</P>
<P>
Offended by the strong abortion rights stand, several prominent bar leaders, 
led by ABA Secretary Anthony Palermo of Rochester, N.Y., and incoming President 
John Curtin Jr. of Boston, organized a campaign to revoke the policy. The two 
worked closely with the Chicago-based Americans United for Life, which opposes 
abortion, and sent letters to nearly 50,000 lawyers calling for the policy to 
be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote "could be a great setback for us" if it is seen as evidence 
that the legal community no longer supports the right to abortion, Estelle 
Rogers, a Washington lawyer and a leader of the abortion rights coalition, said 
after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of the repeal movement repeatedly said they were not advocating an 
anti-abortion stand. Rather, their banner this week was "neutrality now." 
</P>
<P>
In a mass meeting Monday, they won passage of a resolution, by an 885-837 vote, 
urging a neutral policy. On Wednesday morning, the ABA's policy-making body, 
the House of Delegates, endorsed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Weiss, a St. Louis attorney, said the ABA "is not a political 
organization" and "should not be dragged into the political debate on this 
issue." Because lawyers, like most Americans, have "deeply held moral and 
religious feelings" about abortion, "neutrality is the proper position" for the 
association, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other lawyers noted that the ABA plays a nonpartisan role in the legal system, 
which includes accrediting law schools and passing judgment on the 
qualifications of nominees to the Supreme Court. This role could be 
jeopardized, they said, if the ABA took sides on contentious social and 
political issues such as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the abortion rights stand blamed Wednesday's setback on "pressure 
from a vociferous minority" within the ABA. They contended that most lawyers 
and most ABA members favor the right to seek an abortion. But they said that 
abortion opponents had undertaken "a well-funded, well-orchestrated effort" to 
reverse the previous vote. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, this house is being asked to recede from a position in 
favor of individual rights," said Sally Determan, a Washington, D.C., attorney 
who sponsored the abortion rights policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake about it: A vote for this resolution is a vote against a 
woman's right to choose. It says we have no objection to a minority of citizens 
using state laws to impose their views on women who don't share them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously exhausted by the weeklong squabble over abortion, delegates called 
off debate after less than two hours and narrowly approved the neutral policy. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, ABA officials pointed out that only about two dozen votes were 
changed after the Los Angeles meeting. There, a procedural motion on whether to 
adopt an official policy passed by only 14 votes. On Wednesday, the delegates 
decided by a 12-vote margin that the organization would have no official 
position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 26-member California delegation did not support the move.

BRAIN'S MARIJUANA 'RECEPTOR' IS IDENTIFIED; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS SAY THE DISCOVERY SHOULD HELP 'FULFILL THE PROMISE' OF 
THE SUBSTANCE AS MEDICINE.

<P>
After two decades of searching, government researchers have finally identified 
the specific site on the surface of brain cells where marijuana binds to induce 
its mood-altering effects. 
</P>
<P>
Identification of this so-called cannabinoid receptor, reported today in the 
British journal Nature, should provide a major step forward for researchers who 
are trying to produce drugs that have the positive medical effects of marijuana 
without its accompanying intoxicated feeling, disorientation and impaired 
perception and memory. 
</P>
<P>
Marijuana has been found to have therapeutic effects on epilepsy, glaucoma, 
asthma, nausea, pain and hypertension. It is now used to only a limited extent 
in treating nausea in cancer patients, however, because of both the moral 
issues associated with its mood-altering effects and the severe restrictions 
the government has placed on the growth and sale of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of a receptor means that the brain almost certainly produces its 
own chemicals, similar to those found in marijuana, that are used in 
communication between brain cells. Moreover, the location of the cells involved 
suggests the chemicals may be involved in memory and intelligence, as well as 
having therapeutic properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The receptor's not there just so people can go out and smoke pot and get 
high," said pharmacologist Tom I. Bonner of the National Institute of Mental 
Health in Bethesda, Md., a co-author of the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Those naturally occurring compounds or synthetically produced derivatives could 
be the foundation of a whole new family of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The identification of the cannabinoid receptor should "vastly accelerate drug 
development, fulfilling the . . . promise of marijuana as medicine," said 
neuroscientist Solomon H. Snyder of the Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine. "I'd say it's one of the most important discoveries in marijuana 
research." 
</P>
<P>
Pharmacologist Lisa A. Matsuda and her colleagues at the institute sifted 
through genetic material in the brain cells of rats until they found a gene 
that looked like a good candidate for the cannabinoid receptor. 
</P>
<P>
They then inserted the gene into cells from the ovaries of Chinese hamsters. 
These cells, which are widely used in research, do not normally respond to 
marijuana. But when Matsuda exposed the genetically altered cells to 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary ingredient of marijuana, they 
exhibited a biochemical response that could only have been stimulated by the 
receptor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nature paper reports only on the rat brain receptor, Matsuda said 
in an interview that her group has found a similar gene in human brain tissues. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also determined where in the rat brains the receptor was being 
produced. They found that is was most common in the cerebral cortex, which is 
the seat of all conscious sensations and actions, memory, will and 
intelligence. The concentration of cannabinoid receptors is also high in the 
hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in short-term memory. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to new forms of disease therapy, identification of the cannabinoid 
receptor could lead to development of new compounds to ease the craving of 
people who have become habituated to marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda also speculated that some mental disorders whose causes are currently 
unknown may be the result of defects in the cannabinoid receptor. Because of 
the discovery of the receptor, she concluded, "we can learn a lot more about 
how the brain works." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery also provides a definitive solution to a dispute that has been 
roiling the drug abuse research community for years. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers did not believe that a cannabinoid receptor actually existed. 
Because delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is a molecule that dissolves readily in 
fats, researchers long assumed that it exerted its effects by dissolving in the 
membrane of brain cells and disrupting normal activities. 
</P>
<P>
That is the mechanism, for example, by which most anesthetics work. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Allyn C. Howlett, a pharmacologist at the St. Louis University 
School of Medicine, reported experiments that strongly indicated that a 
cannabinoid receptor did exist and that predicted many of its properties. The 
work suggested that the receptor was found primarily in parts of the brain 
involved in thought, learning and memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Her work . . . was probably not accepted by a large group of people because of 
a lot of evidence that argued against a receptor theory," Matsuda said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our results show that there is a gene present that produces the protein that 
she described," thereby confirming Howlett's work and vindicating her 
arguments, Matsuda said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Howlett said that she and her colleagues 
have isolated a chemical that they believe is the brain's naturally occurring 
cannabinoid, but that the work is too preliminary to discuss.

Drawing, MARIJUANA'S EFFECT ON THE BRAIN: To produce its mood-altering and 
therapeutic effects, the primary ingredient of marijuana, 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, binds to a receptor on the surface of cells in 
the same manner that a key fits into a lock. The binding triggers activity 
within the cell. The receptors are found in the highest concentration in two 
major areas of the brain. The cerebral cortex is the seat of all conscious 
sensations and actions, memory, the will, and intelligence. The hippocampus 
plays a crucial role in short-term memory. Los Angeles Times

<P>
The Medical Board of California, levying its harshest punishment, has stripped 
the license of a nationally known cosmetic surgeon in Newport Beach for his 
fraudulent treatment of a disgruntled former Mrs. California and another 
patient, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Administrative Law Judge Rosalynn M. Chapman found that Dr. Michael Elam, 42, 
who gained national prominence in helping redo the face of comedian Phyllis 
Diller, had doctored medical records to obtain fraudulent insurance claims for 
the two patients. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision adopted by the full board, Chapman wrote: "Elam is dishonest and 
has no compunction about lying under oath. . . . (He) has shown no sorrow, 
remorse or contrition for his conduct, and it is, thus, unlikely that he will 
voluntarily change that conduct." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Elam, who was out of the country, promised to appeal.

SALZWEDEL FAILS TO FIND FOOTHOLD IN PRO LEAGUE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: TALENTED GOALKEEPER IS DISMAYED AT HIS LACK OF OPTIONS IN THE SPORT 
AFTER STARRING AT CAL LUTHERAN FOR FOUR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The life of a soccer star fresh out of college is not supposed to be this 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Former Cal Lutheran goalkeeper Dave Salzwedel had intended to earn his degree 
and, with more professional soccer leagues kicking around than summer movie 
sequels, sell himself to the highest bidder. He then would go on to a happy, 
though obscure, career doing his favorite thing, playing soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing more confusing than the number of soccer leagues is their 
organization -- or lack of same. Soccer leagues in this country have come and 
gone, multiplied and divided so frequently over the past two decades that one 
almost has a better chance of resolving the national debt than fathoming 
organized soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Salzwedel, an National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
honorable-mention All-American at Cal Lutheran in 1988 and '89, figured he had 
an outside shot at being drafted in this year's Major Indoor Soccer League 
draft on July 26. Not only was he not contacted by an MISL team, Salzwedel 
didn't even know when the draft was until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
It would be one thing if Salzwedel had not been contacted on purpose. But, 
according to San Diego Sockers Coach Ron Newman, that was not the case. The 
players selected in the draft are not necessarily the best available, according 
to Newman. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard anything about the (Cal) Lutheran goalkeeper, but that 
doesn't mean he shouldn't be here," Newman said on the eve of the College 
Indoor soccer showcase, an all-star game played in Baltimore the day before the 
draft. "We don't have the (means) to hear about and look at all the top players 
in the country. No soccer league does. That's why soccer operates at a 
disadvantage in this country, and more and more kids are going to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Salzwedel has entertained thoughts of playing in Europe but for the time being 
it is a risk he is unwilling to take. Salzwedel, who graduated last spring with 
a degree in communications, currently coaches at soccer camps in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"I would jump on a plane right now for Europe if someone told me they wanted 
me," said Salzwedel, a native of Thousands Oaks. "But I can't afford to do 
that, especially not being certain what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Salzwedel's predicament comes on the heels of a career in which things came 
easily for the 6-foot-1 goalie. 
</P>
<P>
In his first collegiate game against West Coast Christian College in 1986, he 
notched a shutout, the first of 10 he would record that year. In leading Cal 
Lutheran to a 14-5-1 record, Salzwedel posted an 0.60 goals-against average, a 
feat that he was unable to match in the following three years. In 1987, his 
average climbed to a still-impressive 0.93 before topping out at 1.20 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Cal Lutheran posted an 11-7-1 mark, its best since 1986, and 
Salzwedel posted eight shutouts -- he finished with 30 in his college career -- 
and a 1.16 goals-against average. In the final match of the year, he made 19 
saves against The Master's College, then ranked among the NAIA's top 20, but 
his performance went for naught. The game, a 1-1 tie after regulation, finally 
ended after two overtimes in a 5-2 shoot-out won by Master's. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Salzwedel is the best goalie, maybe the best player, to ever don a Cal 
Lutheran uniform," Kingsmen assistant coach Sean Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
His college career over, Salzwedel went to Las Cruces, New Mexico, over the 
winter break as the starting goalie for the West team in the 1990 NAIA Senior 
Bowl. Salzwedel reckoned he'd enjoy a couple of days under the New Mexico sun, 
come back and get his degree in the spring, and then start thinking about 
joining the professional soccer ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern was getting my degree," Salzwedel said. "I thought my 
professional goals would take care of themselves after I was finished with 
school." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the Western Soccer League, which has teams in Los Angeles 
and Santa Barbara, holds its season in the spring. The Western League was 
probably Salzwedel's best opportunity because of the aforementioned teams' 
proximity, but the regular season ended a week and a half ago. All of which has 
left Salzwedel, well, footcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has really talked to me about playing and I haven't really talked to 
anyone," Salzwedel said. "There are a lot of amateur clubs in the area, but you 
can't make a living playing for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you know someone, it is really tough to hook on with a professional 
team. As I have found out." 
</P>
<P>
So if Salzwedel's popularity doesn't suddenly increase and the phone doesn't 
start ringing, expect to see him back at Cal Lutheran in the fall -- as 
goalkeeper coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was planning on being a coach down the line," Salzwedel said. "Sometimes 
things work out in strange ways." 
</P>
<P>
If the sport is professional soccer, count on it.

FORMER BURROUGHS HIGH STAR PENARANDA MAKES AN IMPACT AS AN NFL SPECIAL-TEAMS 
COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're in Orange County and want to laugh, there are several places to go. 
Anaheim Stadium, to watch the Angels, for example. Or go to Disneyland and 
check out the admission prices. Both provide amusement. 
</P>
<P>
But don't talk to Jairo Penaranda. He is not very funny at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Jairo is a very serious guy," said Bob Dunivant, Penaranda's coach at 
Burroughs High in Burbank from 1972-75. "He was very hard-working. There wasn't 
too much humor with Jairo (pronounced HY-row)." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda is, however, a sound choice if you're interested in football. 
</P>
<P>
The former standout running back for Burroughs played at UCLA and then in the 
NFL. He is now a coach with the Rams. And although he never made many people 
laugh, he did make many hold their sides in pain. The 6-foot, 210-pound 
Penaranda did this by running into them on a football field. 
</P>
<P>
"Jairo was one of the best all-around backs in Burroughs history," Dunivant 
said. "He reminded me of Roger Craig, the way he ran. He'd get those knees 
pumping way up high and it was very difficult to tackle him. Very difficult. I 
remember Jairo dragging people down the football field a lot. And he never made 
an attempt to evade people on the field. He went after them." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda, whose brothers Edgar and Al also played football for Burroughs, 
scored five touchdowns in one game at Burroughs during his senior year when he 
was named to the All-CIF and all-state teams. He also played football for 
Burroughs, lettered in track and was the captain of both school teams in his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
He played two seasons at San Fernando Valley State College (now Cal State 
Northridge) and then earned a position on the UCLA roster in 1978 as a walk-on, 
but he did not play in a game that season. In 1979, Coach Terry Donahue used 
Penaranda extensively as a fullback and on special teams, taking advantage of 
his powerful build and mammoth legs and his ability and desire to block giant 
men with little or nothing in the way of a neck. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, however, he carried the ball 55 times for 254 yards and scored two 
touchdowns while continuing to serve as the blocking back and as a wrecking 
ball on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the 1979 season, when he played sparingly, that Penaranda said he 
began looking at the game from a coach's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the second string, you get a lot of time to watch," said 
Penaranda, now 32. "I did that, and I started to look at things differently 
than I did as a player. You start to see the whole game instead of just what 
your assignment is. After a while, I wanted to learn more about the game, to 
learn things from a coach's viewpoint. So I watched and I listened and I 
started thinking that coaching might be fun." 
</P>
<P>
It would, however, have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda was drafted by the Rams in 1980 but played sparingly in the NFL for 
just two seasons. After a season playing for the Oakland Invaders of the U.S. 
Football League, he knew his days of crashing into people were over. But he 
also knew that he wanted to stay in the game. And what he had seen and learned 
as a player and a sideline spectator during the previous several years he now 
wanted to put to use. 
</P>
<P>
His coaching career began in the same place his playing career had started, at 
Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped me for a couple of years," Dunivant said. "He had never mentioned 
coaching to me before that, but after he started I knew he was destined for 
success as a coach. He had such a great way of getting along with the kids, and 
he was such a responsible guy." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda took the next step in 1987, signing on as a volunteer coach working 
with the special teams at USC, not an easy move for a guy who had been 
conditioned for three years to stomp on anything wearing cardinal and gold. 
After two seasons with the Trojans, he got a call from the Rams and began his 
pro coaching career last year, working as an assistant on the special teams. 
</P>
<P>
It is a part of the game that the hard-hitting Penaranda said he enjoys very 
much, now that he doesn't have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"My junior year at UCLA we were playing USC and I got my first chance on the 
kickoff-return team," he said. "We didn't have a very good team that year, and 
I was real nervous about it. I can still remember it so clearly. They kicked 
and all of a sudden all I can see are these huge guys running downfield, and it 
seemed like all of them were running at me. There were several of us together, 
forming the wedge, and they just destroyed us. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got up, I remember thinking, 'This is not for me.' But I stuck with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as he gives advice to the Rams' special-teams players, he knows how they 
feel about such assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people have an image of what special-teams guys are like," Penaranda 
said. "They think all of them must be crazy. But they're not. Special teams are 
a personal challenge. You have to say to yourself, 'My man will not make a 
block,' or 'My man will not make the tackle,' and you have to take it 
personally. But at the same time, you have to work as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Special-teams play is chaos in harmony and a controlled madness. Despite what 
it looks like, there are a lot of rules to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda was born in the Atlantic port of Barranquilla, Colombia. His family 
moved to the United States when he was an infant, settling first in Miami and a 
few years later in Burbank. Penaranda has returned to Barranquilla several 
times. On occasion he and relatives have watched satellite transmissions of old 
NFL games together. His relatives, he said, pretend they understand, but he 
knows better. 
</P>
<P>
"They watch with me because they know that's what I do," he said. "They 
understand very little of it, though." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda, it seems, has enough football knowledge for the entire family. And 
he hopes to know much more about it before he leaves the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can coach permanently," he said. "I hope this is my start, that this 
becomes my career. And I want to stay with the pro game. I watch some college 
games, but I don't want to go back. This is where I want to make my life." 
</P>
<P>
He should, according to one who has watched his transformation from a youngster 
to a 32-year-old man, have few problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Jairo that I always noticed," Dunivant said, "was that 
football was always No. 1 in his life, even as a kid. The other kids had other 
things to do and football was just one of them, but with Jairo it was 
different. He was the first one on the practice field and the last one to 
leave. When he coached with me, he was the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"And even though he had been gone from here for a long time, when he coached 
here the kids on the team listened to Jairo. The name Penaranda means a lot at 
Burroughs."

FISHING / DAN STANTON; 
</P>
<P>
ANGLERS ARE LOADING UP ON DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It appears this summer's sportfishing season could set a record for unusual 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
Recent storms off Cabo San Lucas have pushed the exotics north. 
</P>
<P>
Fluctuating water temperatures have brought dorado and giant squid to Southland 
beaches and close-in fishing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The dorado prefer the warm water. Now these fighters are being caught by local 
party boats. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Toronado and Phantom got into a wide-open dorado bite 
Tuesday morning. The Phantom returned with 140, a limit for its 14 anglers. The 
Toronado had to get through the kelp patties, where line-slashing yellowtail 
were hiding, and decked 25 yellows and more than 100 dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun and Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor have been catching dorado 12 miles 
out and scored with more than 100 Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Southern Cal was fishing for sand bass at the power 
plant when the boat found what deckhand Myron Ackerman described as an invasion 
of giant squid going up to 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The anglers hooked 23 of them and the crew scooped the small ones for bait. 
Anglers baited the small ones and caught 23 yellowtail that weighed up to 20 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran party boat captain Cookie Cook said in his 50 years operating South Bay 
party boats he has never witnessed such a strong showing of dorado and giant 
squid so close to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Big game fish anglers might even see some tackle records broken. Art Laffey of 
Rancho Palos Verdes was trolling on his boat Kelley-Fish 30 miles from Avalon 
using a mackerel clone jig when he had a blind strike, then the battle began. 
For 30 minutes Laffey had to move the boat, holding the fish with his 80-pound 
test line. Finally it tired and aboard came a big-eye tuna. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first tuna weighed in this season at the Avalon scales. It went 222 
1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Gilman and Richard Murray of Wilmington had three successful days of 
fishing at Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Murray fought a marlin for one hour and 40 minutes while Gilman kept busy 
fighting a big dorado. The marlin weighed 436 pounds and the dorado and even 
70. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Friedman of Torrance returned from a one-day albacore trip fishing 90 
miles out aboard the Conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman reeled in nine yellowtail, four skipjack, one dorado and one albacore. 
</P>
<P>
She lost the jackpot when a 40-pound class tuna that she was reeling in for 25 
minutes parted the line as it was ready for the gaff. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Jarrett Makem of Gardena, fishing off San Clemente Island 
aboard the Toronado, caught the whopper of the week, a 30-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Pattie Bown of Torrance, fishing at the rigs aboard the Sportking, caught a 
19-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Walters of Long Beach snagged a squid that weighed 18 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Chudakoff of Lomita, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the horseshoe 
kelp, caught a 16 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Blue of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Victory at the rock pile, caught an 
11-pound bonito. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports -- Big bonito have moved into all areas. The local sand bass bite 
remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished Venice reefs and anglers 
caught 50 bonito, 40 calico bass and 25 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman on a half-day trip returned with a catch of 160 bonito and 11 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in a catch of 220 rock cod, three cow cod 
and a lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Sumo fished the bay and anglers caught a variety -- 105 bonito, 49 sand 
bass, 25 barracuda, three cabazon, three sculpin and a halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray's trip to rocky point found bonito, with 
anglers sacking 186, plus 93 sand bass and a yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack worked Catalina Island for 193 bonito, 36 calico bass and 32 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Redondo on a half-day trip returned with 175 bonito and 40 sand 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special half-day trip resulted in 80 bonito and nine barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The barge Isle of Redondo scored with 2,220 mackerel, 240 bonito and three 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
22nd Street Landing: The First String fished Catalina and chalked up 211 
barracuda, 78 bonito, 48 calico bass and seven yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Monte Carlo on a half-day trip returned with 91 bonito and 51 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: Anglers on the Sportking trip to the horseshoe kelp 
sacked 132 barracuda, 107 bonito and 10 yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Matt Walsh on a half-day trip returned with 194 bonito and 25 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun fished Catalina for dorado and anglers sacked 56 calico bass, 11 
dorado and a yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Dreamer's dorado trip had a catch of 80. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits fished Catalina for 200 calico bass, 76 bonito and 10 dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory fished the rigs for bass and scored with 
141 calico bass, 140 sand bass and 91 bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Cal on a half-day trip returned with 92 calico bass, 35 giant 
squid and 23 yellowtail.

EX-BANNING PLAYER FINDS A HOME AT MONTCLAIR PREP 
</P>

Derek Sparks gazes proudly at a basket overflowing with letters from some of 
the nation's most recognizable universities -- USC, Notre Dame, UCLA, Michigan. 
All promise the Montclair Prep running back the good life as a college football 
star. 
</P>
<P>
But the correspondence represents more to Sparks than just the prospect of a 
college scholarship. It proves that his California dream has been fulfilled and 
symbolizes the reason he left his small-town home in Texas two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more opportunity for everything in California than there was in 
Texas," he said during a recent interview. "As a little kid growing up on the 
poor side of town in Texas, coming to California was like a little kid going to 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks has enjoyed two brilliant seasons since moving from tiny Wharton in 
southeast Texas to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he rushed for 1,394 yards at Banning High in Wilmington and was named 
the sophomore state player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. Citing a fear of gang 
activity in Wilmington and a more rigorous academic environment at Montclair 
Prep, Sparks transferred to the private Van Nuys school before his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
He responded with a stellar season in 1989, earning The Times' San Fernando 
Valley Back of the Year award after rushing for 1,944 yards and scoring 35 
touchdowns for the Mounties. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 212-pound athlete enters his senior season as one of the nation's 
top college prospects. "He's not only one of the premier backs in Southern 
California, but he's among the top 10 across the country," according to Dick 
Lascola, who runs a recruiting service in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
No high school record in the state is safe this year, Sparks said, not even 
Russell White's career rushing mark of 5,998 yards. 
</P>
<P>
To set the record Sparks needs 2,661, a seemingly impossible total in a 10-game 
season. But the Mounties expect to win the Southern Section Division X title, 
which would entail a 14-game schedule. And considering some of Montclair Prep's 
opponents in the Alpha League, Sparks just might dethrone White. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to build yards just for Derek, but we think the record is very 
possible," Montclair Prep Coach George Giannini said. "He's a dominant threat 
and the way we run the ball, we think breaking the record is a realistic goal. 
We'd be very pleased with that." 
</P>
<P>
A slew of potential records notwithstanding, Sparks is troubled as he heads 
into his final season at Montclair Prep. Leland Sparks, who also moved from 
Wharton to Southern California and is a wide receiver for the Mounties, has 
seen his cousin's mood turn sour in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been stress on me too, but it's 
</P>
<P>
not as bad as it has been for Derek. He's been in the middle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks might have little trouble sidestepping a linebacker or slipping 
past a defensive back, but, at 17, he has yet to master the moves necessary to 
thwart this current blitz. Caught in a battle with Jerome Sparks, his uncle and 
former legal guardian, Derek sought refuge last spring in L. A. County juvenile 
court claiming he had been abandoned. The court assumed legal custody and 
Sparks is now a foster child of Steve and Susie Goldbaum, whose son John is a 
teammate of Sparks' at Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks and Derek's mother, June Sparks, who lives in Texas, object to 
the arrangement and want Derek to leave the Goldbaum's Granada Hills home and 
move into an apartment with Leland, a proposal neither Derek nor Leland favors. 
Leland lives in Chatsworth with the Cole family, whose son Greg played 
defensive back for the Mounties last season. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks strenuously denies that he abandoned Derek and claims that 
Montclair Prep and its supporters have plotted to gain control of his nephew. 
His suspicions began in January and climaxed when he learned in May that he had 
lost legal guardianship of Derek to the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like a grizzly bear that someone had come and taken his cub," Jerome 
said. "I couldn't believe they were saying I abandoned him. No way. I still say 
they cooked the whole thing up to get me out of the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Giannini, the Goldbaums and Derek Sparks all deny that. Derek said he is happy 
living with the Goldbaums and wants to stay there, but that he is pained 
because his uncle and mother wish otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why your own people would put pressure on you when you're trying 
to perform your best," he said. "This is all killing me and hurting me. I'm 
busting my butt every day to do things right so I won't have criticism coming 
from me in all these directions. It's getting to the point where the football 
field is the only place I can have some peace." 
</P>
<P>
The discord started for the Sparks family after the holiday vacation last 
winter. Derek and Leland helped lead Montclair Prep to a 12-1 record last fall, 
during which time they lived in an apartment on the school's campus with Eric 
Sparks, Jerome's brother and a former assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Also living in the apartment that semester were teammates John Goldbaum and 
Donovan Roy. Because Montclair Prep is a licensed boarding school, the living 
arrangement violated no Southern Section rules. Those rules also permit Derek 
and Leland to retain their athletic eligibility while living with the families 
of their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
When Derek, Leland and Eric Sparks returned from vacation in Texas, they needed 
new housing because Montclair Prep had torn down the apartment to make room for 
building expansion. Eric and Leland moved into an apartment together, but Derek 
asked John Goldbaum if he could stay with his family, a request the Goldbaums 
gladly agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sole reason for letting him stay is that he's a great kid and he's a great 
influence on my son," said Steve Goldbaum, who owns a plumbing company in 
Granada Hills. "We told him he was more than welcome to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks begrudgingly accepted the arrangement, as long as it was 
temporary. But his discomfort grew when he felt that Derek had distanced 
himself from his mother when she made a surprise visit to Los Angeles in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Derek visited her too infrequently during her two-month visit, Jerome said. 
When Derek rejected his mother's offer to live with Eric, Leland and herself in 
their two-bedroom apartment, the mother and Jerome grew edgy. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to live with the Goldbaums and not in the apartment with them was 
only because of the lack of space," Derek said. "I lived in a tiny apartment 
all my life. Besides, the Goldbaums are good people and were treating me well. 
Everything was taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Too much so, as far as Jerome was concerned. When he gained little satisfaction 
after voicing his concerns to Giannini, the football coach, and PrincipaE. 
Simpson, he threatened to withdraw Derek from school. 
</P>
<P>
"After I told them we were looking for a new school, they started to hate me," 
he said. "That's when they cooked up this whole thing. They got him conditioned 
to talk to me a certain way. Derek was being used and he didn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome claims that his fears were confirmed when the Goldbaums became Derek's 
foster parents in April. 
</P>
<P>
Derek and the Goldbaums offer a totally different version of events. They claim 
Jerome lost touch with Derek for more than a month last winter, prompting Derek 
to suggest the idea of foster care. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when everyone blew their top and started tripping out," Derek said 
about his family. "I like to went crazy over that. I felt like I was about to 
explode." 
</P>
<P>
Said Steve Goldbaum: "After everything was done, then I found out that his 
family was upset. I should have gone to his uncle first. I'm not trying to take 
anyone's family away." 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of foster care, the Goldbaums receive $460 a month from the 
county's Department of Children's Services, which also provides health 
insurance. The Goldbaums are charged with Derek's care until he is 18, when he 
no longer is a ward of the court. He also retains the option of appealing to 
the court to seek new living conditions, including a return to Jerome's 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
The Goldbaums have three children and own a sprawling home in a well-to-do 
neighborhood. Money seems unlikely as a motive for housing Derek. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we probably lose money on the deal," Steve Goldbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, as far as Montclair Prep is concerned, is respect for Derek's 
wishes. Giannini claims that the school has played no role in Derek's decision 
to live with the Goldbaums and would not prevent him from leaving the school. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very, very sad for Derek," he said. "All we want is what is best for 
him. If he wanted to go back with Jerome, we would not stand in his way. But 
he's very happy living at the Goldbaums. He says he wants to stay at Montclair 
Prep and we're happy to have him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the objections of his family, Derek remains at the Goldbaums and 
returned to Granada Hills after a monthlong vacation in Texas this summer. He 
talks regularly with his uncle, who keeps a cordial if not close relationship 
with the Goldbaums. Jerome offered his best wishes to Susie Goldbaum on 
Mother's Day last spring, and when Derek and Leland returned from their summer 
vacation in Texas, Jerome met them at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome is a 38-year-old former semipro baseball player who moved to California 
in 1976, runs a carpet cleaning business and lives in Inglewood. He rues the 
loss of control he had over Derek and seems torn on how to handle the 
situation. One minute, he talks of Montclair Prep conspiracies and what he 
calls the brainwashing of his nephew. The next, he professes his loyalty and 
concern for Derek. He threatens to seek legal help, but so far has not done so. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his changing sentiments, Jerome remains steadfast on one issue. He 
wants to reunite Derek and Leland under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want Leland and Derek back together like we started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Derek's mother agrees, even though many of her fears for her only son's 
well-being were allayed during Derek's visit last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a nice time and got along just fine," she said. "I still don't want him 
to stay at the Goldbaums. I want him around some of my people." 
</P>
<P>
Leland also laments Derek's plight, although he remains on the periphery of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been so close for so long that if he feels bad, I feel bad for the same 
reason," he said. "I'd rather not comment on what Jerome is saying. But if 
there's a problem, it'll be worked out by the family." 
</P>
<P>
Derek is not so sure. To outsiders, his future might seem assured on the 
football field, but Derek has doubts about making it through his senior season. 
Still, he has impressed members of the Montclair Prep community with his 
maturity and strength of character. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a high-spirited young man and a fine human being," said Lois Cole, who 
houses Leland at her Chatsworth home. "He's very dedicated and takes great 
pride in what he supports. There's no stopping Derek Sparks." 
</P>
<P>
On the football field, few would dispute that claim. But living in California 
has proved troublesome for Derek, who expresses no regret about leaving Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think I would have regrets, but I don't," he said. "I knew it would 
be a challenge coming to California, but the hard part has come off the field. 
Everybody is always calling me to give me advice. I don't trust anyone anymore. 
I don't trust a soul. I just have to look out for myself. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm happy at Montclair Prep and living with the Goldbaums. I don't want to 
let all these things distract me. I just want to get on the field and score 
some touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, perhaps, that has been the easy part for Derek Sparks.

PAYSINGER TACKLES NEW JOB AS HEAD COACH AT BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This spring was a particularly tough time for the Beverly Hills High football 
program. Memories remained from the bitter teachers' strike in the fall, which 
resulted in the forfeiture of three games, the resignations of longtime 
Co-Coaches Dick Billingsley and Bill Stansbury to accept jobs at other schools 
and the cancellation of spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
"All anyone could talk about was transferring out of here," junior Ziv Gottlieb 
said. "I was looking into the possibility of either transferring to Crespi or 
Loyola. I figured this program was going nowhere. We didn't even have a coach." 
</P>
<P>
The traditionally strong Normans, who will compete this season in the realigned 
Bay League with Hawthorne, Inglewood, Leuzinger, Culver City and Santa Monica, 
seemed like a team on the decline. 
</P>
<P>
But morale took an about-face in mid-June when Principal Ben Bushman promoted 
veteran assistant Carter Paysinger to head coach. The selection was 
overwhelmingly popular with the players. 
</P>
<P>
"Naming Carter as head coach was a dream that I thought would never come true," 
said Gottlieb, who will start at quarterback this season. "I can't think of 
anyone who would have been better. When we heard the news about Carter, 
everybody in school was doing high-fives. He's always been a players' coach and 
that's why we all like him." 
</P>
<P>
Bushman's decision appears to have been a wise one. No one ended up 
transferring and more players are expected to go out for the team this fall 
than did last season. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger's appointment is unprecedented because he is the first alumnus and 
part-time faculty member to coach football at Beverly Hills. He also is the 
first black to head the football program. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it hasn't been a racial problem and frankly, I don't anticipate it to 
be one," Paysinger said. "People here know me and know what I'm about." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger has been an assistant at Beverly Hills since 1980, but there are 
several obstacles he must overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions remain from the teachers' strike and the subsequent failure of 
Proposition B, which would have raised $4.5 million for the Beverly Hills 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury and Billingsley walked the picket line last fall, leaving the team 
without any coaches for three Bay League games. The Normans had to forfeit 
those games and ended the season at 3-7, failing to qualify for the playoffs. A 
few months later, Billingsley was informed by the district that budget cuts 
likely would result in the elimination of his teaching and coaching position. 
He accepted a job at Oak Park High in Agoura. Fearing further cutbacks, 
Stansbury also jumped ship and took a job at Paso Robles High near San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger, who played football and baseball at Beverly Hills from 1971-74, has 
taught physical education at the school since 1985, but he was on a leave on 
absence last year to devote more time to his financial brokerage business. He 
remained a football assistant, coaching the quarterbacks and receivers and 
helping put together the offensive game plan. 
</P>
<P>
When Bushman called in June and offered Paysinger the job, he needed only a few 
hours to make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been an assistant so long, that I couldn't pass up an opportunity to 
finally be in charge," said Paysinger, who will teach two classes at Beverly 
Hills this fall and continue his job as a broker part time. "Despite my busy 
schedule with my business, I am making time for this because I want to see how 
I do when I'm calling the shots. I guess when you're an assistant for so many 
years, you always wonder how you'll do when you become the head coach. It's 
time to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, though, the strike business is over and it's time for 
a clean slate. I think that whole thing is finally behind us now." 
</P>
<P>
Putting together a coaching staff was Paysinger's first task. Within days of 
his promotion, his staff was intact. He rehired his brothers, Vonzie and Donald 
Paysinger, as assistants. Vonzie, an assistant at Beverly Hills since 1983, 
will be the offensive coordinator, and Donald, an assistant since '82, will be 
the offensive line coach. He also hired Brian Cook, a former defensive back at 
Carson High who went on to play at USC. Cook will be in charge of the defensive 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when I wasn't sure if I would return," Vonzie said. "It all 
depended on who was going to be the head coach. If the school would have hired 
a new guy from the outside, I wasn't too excited about starting the program all 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I wanted my brother to get his chance. When they selected Carter, I 
knew I would be back. I'm excited about this year, and also my increased 
duties. I was ready for a bigger role." 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury praised his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Carter is very bright, personable, has excellent rapport with the athletes and 
is a very knowledgeable football person," Stansbury said. "Hiring him was the 
best thing for the program because there will be continuity." 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing spring drills, the Normans have been back to a normal schedule 
since Paysinger took over. Most of the returning players currently are enrolled 
in a six-week physical education class at the school, which is taught by 
Paysinger. Players spend two hours each morning on the practice field running 
through plays and discussing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger appears comfortable in his new role and said few changes are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue running a pro-style offense," he said. "The only change on 
defense is that we will platoon. We will be more aggressive on defense and 
force the action instead of waiting for it to come to us. But all of the 
terminology will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger, 34, said the biggest difference his players will notice this season 
is that they will be able to have open discussions with the coaching staff. 
Although he said Stansbury and Billingsley had a good rapport with the team, he 
said he is more low-key and less of a disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not much of a yeller," he said. "I just talk to the kids on a relaxed 
level, and I want them to feel like they can do the same with me. All of 
coaches are like that, so I think it will be a very positive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger isn't ready to make any predictions on his team's chances this 
season, but like most coaches, he is optimistic. The Normans return five 
starters on offense and four on defense. Seniors Darren Smith (wide receiver) 
and Greg Holmes (running back) are considered college prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"All you can do is give your players the best opportunity to perform," 
Paysinger said. "What happens on the field is up to the players. At this point, 
I'm not nervous about wins and losses. 
</P>
<P>
"But give me a little time."

MOUNTAIN-BIKE CHAMPION TOMAC TRYING TO BECOME KING OF THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SLUSSER, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cross-training is all the rage, but few can do it at a world-class level. Bo 
Jackson, definitely. Deion Sanders, maybe. And in cycling, the man of many 
helmets is John Tomac. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac, a 22-year-old native of Chatsworth, is the current world mountain-biking 
champion despite having spent most of the year competing in road races. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more of a crossover between the two sports, definitely, but it's 
difficult to cross over and be good at both disciplines," said Tom Schuler, 
7-Eleven racing team manager and a teammate of Tomac. "John is the only one at 
this point who can do both well. It really takes some time and technique to 
make the move, but John has shown quite a bit as a road racer." 
</P>
<P>
Tomac claimed the world mountain-bike title in Belgium in September, then 
returned to Europe to race in spring road classics such as Paris-Roubaix. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with my results," said Tomac, who signed with the 7-Eleven team 
this year. "They were nothing super, but I really want to concentrate on the 
spring races." 
</P>
<P>
Tomac returned to the United States and again hit the mountain-bike circuit. 
</P>
<P>
In July, he won a race at Crested Butte, Colo., and overcame severe chain 
problems to finish second in a National Off-Road Bicycling Assn. event in Park 
City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tomac: "I've won more than half the mountain-bike races I've entered this 
year. I've got good strength from road racing and that carries over. I just 
have to make a few adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been riding with the 7-Eleven squad, Tomac actually is devoting 
most of his time to off-road training in Colorado in preparation for the World 
Mountain Bike championships in Durango, Colo., in September. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to mix them together," Tomac said. "It's a natural for me; it's not a 
hard transition." 
</P>
<P>
His trade team, 7-Eleven, would prefer that Tomac stick to road racing, but his 
contract allows him to ride a limited number of mountain-bike events per year. 
</P>
<P>
"For John, maybe it's good now that he's getting back into mountain-bike racing 
because it will give him a nice break," Schuler said. "But as John becomes more 
of a factor in road racing and on the team, he will have to specialize more. He 
will have to make a choice. . . . It's not easy, but he can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Few others have fared so well in making the switch. 
</P>
<P>
Top mountain-biker Ned Overend was an undistinguished road racer. Rishi Grewal, 
younger brother of Olympic road racing gold medalist Alexi Grewal, has had some 
success in both events. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are going back and forth because there's some money to be made in 
mountain biking now," Tomac said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Tomac took up road racing four years ago as a means of keeping in 
shape for the off-road circuit. 
</P>
<P>
He made rapid progress, riding for the U.S. national team last year and placing 
an impressive 17th in the inaugural Tour de Trump. He was named the top 
all-around rider in the world by VeloNews magazine in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I was just on the road for training for mountain bikes," Tomac 
said. "But I was also winning most of my mountain-bike races and was looking 
for more of a challenge, something more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
His mountain-biking skills have served him well in the realm of the skinny 
tire. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of bike racing is your ability to stay in the pack and not get muscled 
out," Schuler said. "That's where mountain biking has helped John. A newcomer 
to road racing usually has a tougher time staying up front, but because of his 
bike-riding skill and his aggressive style, John is not afraid to go elbow to 
elbow with another rider." 
</P>
<P>
The most important characteristic Tomac has shown, according to Schuler, is his 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
"John is very serious about his profession," Schuler said. "He's always 
planning out his next step and how to get better. He knows where he wants to go 
and he knows he wants to be a road racer and be successful on the European 
circuit. You have to be impressed with that." 
</P>
<P>
Tomac made his name on a mountain bike, but there is no doubt where his heart 
now lies. "I consider myself a road racer now," he said.

WOODLAND HILLS TEAM BEATEN IN U.S. OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Woodland Hills Astros surrendered two runs in the bottom of the ninth 
inning and fell to the Florida Braves, 3-2, Tuesday night in a National 
Division game of the U.S. Open Baseball tournament at Galvin Field in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros, 3-1 in the tournament, complete division play tonight against the 
Fairbanks (Alaska) Goldpanners (4-0). 
</P>
<P>

NEW AUTO DEALERSHIP OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved an agreement with a Montclair car dealer to put a 
new Jeep-Eagle auto dealership in the Pomona Auto Center, along the Corona 
Expressway. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the redevelopment agency to sell the 3.3-acre site for 
$445,776 to Pomona Valley Jeep-Eagle Inc., which has been formed by the owner 
of Pomona Valley Dodge in Montclair. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency will give the dealer $400,000 in sales tax rebates if 
the dealership meets certain conditions, including opening within a year after 
the close of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas B. Dunlap, deputy executive director of the redevelopment agency, said 
the owners plan to open the dealership in eight months and expect to generate 
$20 million in sales the first year.

BOND PROPOSAL WOULD DOUBLE HELLMAN PARK WILDERNESS; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: IF VOTERS APPROVE, $15 MILLION WILL BE SPENT TO BUY 300 ACRES OF 
PRIME, UNDEVELOPED HILLSIDE AND BUILD TRAILS, PICNIC FACILITIES, PARKING LOTS 
AND ACCESS ROADS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wilderness park in the Whittier Hills would more than double in size if 
county voters approve an $817-million bond issue in November, preserving 
indefinitely some of the last prime hillside land untouched by development in 
eastern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The county bond issue would set aside $15 million to add about 300 acres to 
Whittier's 200-acre Hellman Park and preserve it as wilderness. Land would be 
bought with $10 million of the bond, and and $5 million would go toward such 
park improvements as trails, picnic facilities, parking lots and access roads. 
Whittier would be responsible for maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The extension of Hellman Park would stretch across a hillside noted for steep, 
rugged canyons, 150-year-old oaks and sycamores and a climate of cool, moist 
nights and dry, balmy days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a special area," said Dave Cowardin, president of Friends of the 
Whittier Hills, a Whittier conservation group that has long sought to bar 
development in the hills. "It's an interface between the coastal basin, which 
experiences fog, and the desert. It's unique as an example of what was once 
common in the Puente Hills." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors placed the bond issue on the 
November ballot by a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Pete Schabarum casting the lone 
dissenting vote. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn missed the Tuesday session. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Mayor Thomas K. Sawyer and Councilman Robert F. Woehrmann attended the 
meeting to lobby for the parks measure, as did Assistant City Manager Manny 
Ocampo. 
</P>
<P>
"Whittier is definitely a major beneficiary, but many cities are benefiting," 
Ocampo said. "It is a regional program. Just as beaches benefit the whole 
county, so does a regional park." 
</P>
<P>
Ocampo said developers and major landowners have not opposed the idea thus far 
because their land would be bought at market value. 
</P>
<P>
The entire bond issue would be paid for by increased property taxes, an average 
increase of $10 a year for a property with an assessed value of $125,000, said 
Esther Feldman, spokeswoman for the Mountains Recreation and Conservation 
Authority, which wrote the bond issue after consulting with political and civic 
leaders across the county. 
</P>
<P>
Three groups compose Feldman's organization: the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy (which acquires land in the Santa Monica Mountains for parks), the 
Conejo Recreation and Park District and the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District. Both park districts administer public lands in Ventura County and 
will not be affected directly by the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue includes money for parks and recreation programs in all county 
cities and also specifies particular projects, such as the Whittier Hills, for 
special financing. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said the park idea fit perfectly into what the bond issue seeks to 
accomplish, because the hills are a regional resource whose preservation has 
strong public and private support. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the last remaining spots of open space in the Puente Hills," 
Feldman said. "It has mountains and canyons and streams which run a good 
portion of the year. You go up there and you hear no traffic in one of the most 
populated areas of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Such land has been so desirable that only a unique combination of factors has 
left more than 2,500 acres of these hills intact. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationist Cowardin said that most of the terrain has a slope of 50 
degrees or more: "That's unbuildable for most people. And the Whittier 
earthquake fault moves right through there." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rose Hills Memorial Park Assn. owns large sections of nearby 
hillsides and has maintained open space around its cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Cowardin also said that in the 80 years that oil companies have drilled in the 
hills, "the oil has been more valuable to Chevron than the land." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the oil companies and the memorial park, much of the land belongs to 
the Hellman estate and the Childs estate, both private trusts. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor limiting building has been Whittier's longstanding hillside 
ordinance to prevent overdevelopment of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Ocampo said: "Any development must meet stringent guidelines of slope 
requirements and preserve the existing environment, including the natural 
terrain. The ordinance limits density and grading. It allows no building on 
ridgelines, and there are restrictions to preserve flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been effective," Ocampo said. "It has resulted in literally no 
development in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Without it, noted a local developer who asked to remain anonymous, "By now, the 
hills would have been covered over with houses like postage stamps." 
</P>
<P>
Cowardin and Councilwoman Helen McKenna-Rahder are among those who would like 
to see a wilderness park of closer to 2,500 acres, five times the likely size 
of an expanded Hellman Park. They said time may be running short to save vast 
areas of hillside, as oil reserves decline and Chevron USA Inc. and other 
landowners explore development options. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the hills remain unincorporated county territory and thus outside of 
Whittier's direct control. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just an anti-development issue," McKenna-Rahder said. "It's a 
pro-preservation issue. In Whittier, we have an area that gives us an ocean 
breeze and an edge on the smog and the traffic."

LIBRARY TO CLOSE BRIEFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to close the library from Aug. 25 to Sept. 8 in 
order to bring the facility into the computer age. 
</P>
<P>
Librarians and volunteers plan to spend 95 hours placing bar codes on the 
library's 94,432 books so the volumes can be scanned by computers similar to 
those used in supermarkets. The library has been using a manual, card-catalogue 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The last week of August and the beginning of September are traditionally slow 
for the library because the summer reading program is over and many people take 
vacations around Labor Day weekend, librarian Monica Greening said.

HAMBURGER JOINT'S OWNERS USE FOOD TRUCK TO DISH UP TREATS AFTER FIRE SHUTS 
STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Like a greasy phoenix rising from the ashes, Meaty Meat Burgers has reopened 
for business. 
</P>
<P>
The hamburger stand lost its home last month, when a late-night fire consumed 
the tin-and-wood roof and walls of the former bus shelter at the corner of Pico 
Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Panic, We Will Be Back in two or three Weeks," said a sign painted on 
the wall of the eatery, which is as well known for its jaunty name and bilious 
green paint job as it is for its highly spiced hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
But after taking a week off, the owners rented a caterer's truck and went back 
to dishing out their simple fare -- single or double burgers with bacon, egg, 
chile or cheese, on three sizes of bun with "mayo," mustard, onion, pickle, 
tomato and lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep our customers coming back and happy while we build," said 
Sharon Rector, daughter of owner Delphinia Langford, who opened Meaty Meat 
Burgers 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Five family members and two long-time employees have been working there ever 
since, serving a clientele who come on foot, by bus and in vehicles ranging 
from rusty jalopies to gleaming Mercedes-Benzes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing special is it's cooked with love," Rector said. "It's just a 
good home hamburger, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
The cramped outdoor seating area with its 12 red-topped stools -- now closed 
off because of the fire -- was an informal place where strangers found it easy 
to chat, customer Kimberly Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good place to come after an all-night party," she said. "There's 
something about a Meaty Meat Burger. It sort of absorbs the alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Malter, who said he has been a customer about once a week for five years, 
said he found the thick patty to be "just like what hamburgers used to be when 
we were kids, before McDonald's and plastic came out." 
</P>
<P>
An architect is drawing up plans for the new Meaty Meat, Rector said, but the 
family wants it to keep its homey look. "We feel it's a landmark," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The early-morning fire, the origin of which is still undetermined, left the 
outdoor dining area untouched and only charred the iron grill and cooktop where 
as many as 400 patties a day would sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
But the bright green paint scheme, which includes a wall painting of a 
cheeseburger against a mountain landscape, may have to go. "We just don't know 
about that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Meaty Meat's hamburger was rated "best in Los Angeles" by a Times 
reviewer, who praised it as a "people's burger -- fatty, peppery meat . . . all 
the works and not much money . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone sees it that way, of course. The reviewer "must have been 
hallucinating," a reader wrote, calling it "a lousy $4 meal."

10% WATER CUTBACK URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's continuing drought prompted the City Council to adopt a 
resolution asking residents to curtail water use by 10% compared with last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The council also urged restaurants to serve water to patrons only when asked. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena belongs to the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District, which has urged its members to adopt water-saving policies. If 
voluntary measures don't achieve the 10% reduction, the city may consider 
enacting a mandatory water conservation program.

CITY SCORES WELL ON SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine of 10 residents think that city services are adequate or better, and one 
out of four could not name a single thing that they disliked about living in 
the city, according to a recent telephone survey commissioned by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The survey sampled 409 Monrovia residents from every corner of the city and 
every ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
The qualities most people listed when asked what they liked about living in 
Monrovia were the small-town community feeling, the city's redevelopment 
efforts and proximity to other areas. When they found something to dislike, 
residents cited smog, hillside development and drugs.

EAST COMPTON'S NAME CHANGE RILES OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COMPTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started about 10 days ago. Green and white signs began popping up in the two 
unincorporated areas that are home to some 15,000 people on the east side of 
this city. 
</P>
<P>
The area known as East Compton, it seemed, had suddenly become East Rancho 
Dominguez. And once again, Compton officials saw the move as another attack on 
the city's beleaguered reputation. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Compton's neighbors have been scrambling to change street 
names and postal addresses to distance themselves from the city's reputation 
for violent crime, gangs and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"It duplicates what the other cities have done in terms of disassociating 
themselves from Compton," said Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the move to adopt the name East Rancho Dominguez say it was a simple 
matter of giving the area its own identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood, Westchester, Westwood all have their own identity," said Mary Lee 
Baker, who worked on the name change for her boss, Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Deane Dana, who represents Compton. She said residents and business 
owners in the area had been talking about the idea for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials were stunned by the change and saw it as just another in a 
series of insults hurled at Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Paramount became the first city to erase the name Compton 
Boulevard from its municipal map. The east-west traffic artery became Somerset 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Then cities to the west and south, Gardena, Hawthorne, Lawndale and Redondo 
Beach, did the same. One by one, they renamed the portion of Compton Boulevard 
that ran through their communities to Marine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Medical Center moved its mailbox from one side of the hospital to the 
other so it would have a Long Beach, instead of a Compton, address. 
</P>
<P>
Now, faced with what it perceives as the latest affront, the Compton City 
Council this week mailed a letter to Dana, demanding to know why Compton was 
not told about East Rancho Dominguez. Councilman Maxcy D. Filer said the area 
is within what is traditionally known as the city's sphere of influence and 
Compton should have been consulted. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't change attitudes by changing names," Filer said. "Problems of 
criminality, problems of gangs, there's nowhere to run. They don't stop at city 
borders. (Criminals) don't stop and say, 'Hey, wait a minute. We're in East 
Rancho Dominguez. We can't do this anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
Council members also note that Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated, largely 
industrial area that lies south of Compton, is not contiguous to the new East 
Rancho Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nowhere near there," Moore said. "It doesn't make any sense. There's no 
continuity." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jane Robbins said Compton will fight to have the name change 
reversed, even though the county has already put up the signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they can pull them down, too," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the change is final and did not require the approval of the Board of 
Supervisors, the Local Agency Formation Commission or the city of Compton. The 
city, Baker added, has no jurisdiction in county areas. 
</P>
<P>
The name change only required the cooperation of area postal officials, Baker 
said, adding that mail is already being delivered with the new name on it, 
although the ZIP code, 90221, will stay the same. That ZIP code also covers 
much of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The next step, said Gray, will be to drop the moniker East Compton from in 
front of the county library, social service center and park located in the area 
and replace it with East Rancho Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Comer, a resident of the area who sat on the county redevelopment 
advisory committee that came up with the name East Rancho Dominguez, said: "I 
think we deserve it. Compton does not service this area in any way but the 
schools. Willowbook (a county area on Compton's northern municipal border) has 
its own identity. We aren't part of Compton." 
</P>
<P>
The two county pockets in question are both designated redevelopment areas and 
Gray said the county spends about $1 million a year in redevelopment funds 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, backers of the change deny they are trying to disassociate themselves 
from Compton, but privately, the story is a little different. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, myself, we're trying to attract business in here," said one 
resident of the area, who asked not to be identified. He said developers often 
will not come to an area if it bears the name Compton. It can even be 
difficult, he said, to get service people such as plumbers and electricians to 
come to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the change will "stabilize" the area. A motel development is being 
planned and local business people are planning renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Robinson, a Compton resident who used to live in the area but now rents 
her property there, said she believes the move was led by development interests 
lured by the freeway off-ramps at Rosecrans Avenue and Alondra Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said she gets 10 or 12 letters a week from real estate speculators 
asking her to sell her property. 
</P>
<P>
The change, she said, is part of a thrust by small business owners and 
developers trying to make big money in the real estate business. She says those 
interests will try to move the largely low-income people in the area out. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the area is one of the poorest and most dangerous in terms of drug 
trafficking and crime, according to council members and police sources. 
</P>
<P>
Its proximity to the Long Beach (710) Freeway makes it an ideal entrance area 
for outsiders to get off the freeway, buy drugs, and then depart quickly, 
police say. Gangs, police sources have said, have carried out violent turf wars 
over drug sales there. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Filer said, maybe the change will be a "blessing in disguise." 
In the past when violent crimes occurred in the area, Filer said, Compton 
always had to take the blame when in fact the area belonged to the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Compton endured its first public snub in 1985, when Dominguez Medical Center 
changed its mailing address from one side of the hospital to the other, making 
it Long Beach instead of Compton. The following year, Paramount became the 
first neighboring city to change the name of that portion of Compton Boulevard 
that ran through the city. In 1988, Gardena, Hawthorne and Lawndale followed 
suit. Early this year, Redondo Beach joined them. Now, two unincorporated areas 
on the east side of Compton have decided to call themselves East Rancho 
Dominguez.

NO VOTE ON POLICE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to let voters decide in November whether the city should build a new 
police station was scrapped at Tuesday's meeting of the City Council, which 
voted to delay any citywide election until next year. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Bonholtzer, chairman of the Police Facility Citizen's Advisory Committee, 
recommended that the council delay the vote because the committee believes that 
there would not be enough time to campaign on behalf of the new station and 
because of the complexity and length of the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is a vital issue for the city and we're afraid that if we try to 
move too fast, the people of Monrovia won't get the right information," 
Bonholtzer told the council.

<P>
PROPERTY OWNERS CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office has filed separate misdemeanor charges against 
two Covina property owners who allegedly cluttered their yards with vehicles, 
rubbish and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Davis and Henry Cordova are scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 5 in Citrus 
Municipal Court in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, owner of a single-family home in the 500 block of East Greenhaven 
Street, has been charged with four misdemeanor counts of failing to park 
inoperable cars and motorcycles in a garage or a paved area. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Cordova, owner of a large lot in the 1400 block of Holt Avenue, has been

trailers on an unpaved surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Davis could not be reached for comment. Cordova admitted he failed to clean up 
the property, but thought his horses would be allowed because he has applied 
for a permit to build a house.

ANGER BUILDS AGAINST 'MANSIONIZATION'; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: RESPONDING TO RESIDENTS' COMPLAINTS, ARCADIA AND SAN GABRIEL PUT 
TIGHTER LIMITS ON CONSTRUCTION TO AVOID 'MONSTER HOUSES' ON SMALL LOTS.

<P>
The San Gabriel Valley movement against "mansionization" gained momentum this 
week as city councils in Arcadia and San Gabriel tightened building codes to 
further guard against construction of bulky single-family houses that dominate 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of angry residents, the Arcadia City Council on Tuesday 
unanimously approved an amendment that will put stricter limits on the height 
and the total square footage of new homes. Depending on the size of the lots, 
single-family houses could not exceed a maximum height of 25 to 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"They're out of place, huge and imposing," said Linda Larew of Arcadia, arguing 
for revisions that would reduce the potential size of houses. 
</P>
<P>
When an architect who has designed large Arcadia houses addressed the council, 
one woman shouted: "Someone should set a firebomb to one of his houses." 
</P>
<P>
Feelings were intense in San Gabriel, too. Maddie Petersen said residents of 
single-family neighborhoods such as hers have a right "not to be built on top 
of one another." 
</P>
<P>
Comments such as these drew enthusiastic applause from audiences in both 
cities. In Arcadia, more than 75 spectators filled the council chambers to 
near-capacity. Although far fewer in number, the San Gabriel advocates of 
controls were firm in expressing their resolve. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel ordinance cited rising land values as a contributing factor to 
the increase in the "overbuilding" on lots for both single-and multiple-family 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to San Gabriel and Arcadia, councils in Glendora, Pasadena, South 
Pasadena and Monterey Park have looked at the issue or plan to do so. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Monterey Park's council will consider whether to enact building 
restrictions. "We got some real big houses going in now," Monterey Park 
Planning Director M. Margo Wheeler said. "I've got one little old lady that 
calls me, crying about a house that's going up in her neighborhood. One of our 
planning commissioners, Joe Rubin, calls them monster houses." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Glendora City Council on Monday referred a staff report on 
large houses to its Planning Commission, suggesting that the commission hold a 
hearing on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The staff report on mansionization contained 10 recommendations for further 
restrictions on residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
In Arcadia's case, this is the third time in two years that the council has 
scaled down the size of single-family houses. The latest changes come just six 
months after the council restricted the size of two-story homes. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, San Gabriel on Tuesday revised an ordinance enacted in January. "The 
current ordinance is not quite sufficient," Planning Commissioner Guy Denechaud 
told the council. He said a four-member committee had taken a hard look at 
houses that are "invasive, intrusive and inconsistent" with surrounding houses. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months the "anti-mansionization" forces in the San Gabriel Valley 
have invoked Arcadia as a good example of what they do not want. 
</P>
<P>
"One only has to drive through Arcadia to see what we're talking about," San 
Gabriel Planning Commissioner Dennis Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Haygood of Arcadia agrees. Living next to a bulky house, she told the 
Arcadia council, makes her feel as if she lives in a fish bowl. 
</P>
<P>
However, restrictions did not please everyone. Arcadia resident Milton Bade, a 
builder, said: "I'm not happy with the height limitation. I think it should be 
higher, at least 35 feet, because houses would look better, and have a better 
architectural design." 
</P>
<P>
Other builders and homeowners complained that the new regulations would affect 
plans they have worked on for months. In response, the council agreed that the 
ordinance would become effective in 60 days for applicants with building plans 
already under review by the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, San Gabriel Councilman Sabino Cici said he was worried about how 
the restrictions might affect a homeowner who wants to remodel. Councilwoman 
Mary Cammarano replied: "If you are looking for a perfect ordinance, there 
isn't one." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the discussion in San Gabriel focused on how much space should be 
allocated to side yards. One difficulty with the overall issue, Planning 
Commission member Dennis Williams said, is "we can't place 1990s standards on 
1920s lots." 
</P>
<P>
Glendora community correspondent Brad Haugaard contributed to this report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
"Mansionization" describes the phenomenon of big houses being built on small 
lots. The trend has increased in the San Gabriel Valley and throughout the 
county as housing prices have risen. In some cases, building codes allowed 
smaller houses to be razed and replaced by bulky structures. In others, an 
existing home is expanded into a "monster house." Some residents complain that 
the big houses harm their neighborhood's character and invade their privacy. 
City councils have responded by tightening codes to allow for more lot space 
around houses.

<P>
PAYMENT FOR SLIME DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has agreed to pay most of the costs of installing an 
underground storm drain to stem the flow of green slime onto three local 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The slime is caused by irrigation runoff from the Covina Palms housing 
development on Rimsdale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-inch drain will be installed on the west side of Glentana Street, a 
cul-de-sac abutting the development. The $150,000 project is scheduled for 
completion Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Developers McIntyre/Reenders Development Co. and Lewis Homes of California will 
contribute $45,000 and the city will pay $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
Residents blame city officials for failing to require the storm drain before 
the site was developed. The developers have argued that they should not have to 
pay the entire cost since the city had not originally required the drain.

RECYCLING PROGRAM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a mandatory residential recycling program to 
begin Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's Refuse Disposal, which contracts with the city, will provide every 
residence with separate collection bins for newspapers, glass and aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
The bins will be picked up on regular trash collection days. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program is mandatory, residents can either participate in the 
curbside effort or take their recyclable materials to buyback centers or other 
recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners will pay nothing for the service the first year. During the second 
year, they will pay a recycling charge of up to 25 cents a month. The cost for 
the third year has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The program was approved last Wednesday on a 4-1 vote, with Councilman Herschel 
Keyser dissenting because he opposes the mandatory fee.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appellate court judge from Culver City has been nominated to serve as 
presiding justice for the 2nd District Court of Appeal, Division 5. 
</P>
<P>
Paul A. Turner, an associate justice for the 2nd District court, was nominated 
to the post Monday by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
On the appellate court since last fall, he would replace Campbell Lucas, who

<P>
ONTRA CAFETERIA DEMOLITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has approved the demolition of 
the controversial Ontra Cafeteria, once a landmark Hollywood building that was 
severely damaged by a fire five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company that owns the building, Herbert Properties, which had sued the city 
to gain permission to tear it down, received the redevelopment agency's 
permission to demolish the structure late last week. 
</P>
<P>
The owner plans to build a 90-space surface parking lot on the site, according 
to an Aug. 4 memo from Cooke Sunoo, the agency's Hollywood project manager. 
</P>
<P>
In processing a demolition permit for the structure, the agency determined that 
the parking lot is a permitted use of the site under current zoning and land 
use codes and the Hollywood Community Plan, Sunoo said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the historic character of the building, the agency has required that 
a photographic record of its architectural features be prepared and that 
preservation organizations be allowed to identify and remove any unique 
architectural features. 
</P>
<P>
The former cafeteria, at 1717-1719 Vine St., was the site of Hollywood's first 
post office and was later a favored gathering place for hungry actors and other 
film-industry workers. 
</P>
<P>
City Cultural Heritage Commission officials had sought to protect the building 
by designating it as a landmark but were rebuffed recently by a judge who said 
the city overstepped its authority in trying to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cultural Heritage Commission officials sought city permission to 
appeal the judge's ruling, the City Council declined to intervene to save the 
building.

DRILLING BEGINS ON NEW WATER WELL -- THE CITY'S 24TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drilling began this week on a new municipal water well, located on Paramount 
Boulevard and Gallatin Road. Last month, Downey bought a 2,500-square-foot 
parcel for the well, which is to be a safeguard against breakdowns of existing 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
The well will be 1,000 feet deep, said W.A. Ralph, director of public works. If 
all goes as planned, drilling costs are expected to be $300,000, he said. 
Including the cost of the land, the city is expected to spend $500,000 on the 
new well. The city already has 23 wells, Ralph said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has hired the Anaheim-based consulting firm of Willdan Associates to 
monitor noise levels and environmental impact during the project. 
</P>
<P>
The well is expected to be completed by the end of fall and will pump 3,000 
gallons per minute, Ralph said.

STORM-DRAIN CLEANUP FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, standing in front of a Ballona Creek storm drain 
that dumps into Santa Monica Bay, signed a new city law Monday that charges 
property owners for improvements to the city's 1,100-mile storm-drain system. 
</P>
<P>
Joined by environmentalists and other city officials, Bradley described the new 
fee as a small price for stopping the flow of untreated urban runoff into the 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
During its first year, the new assessment will cost the average homeowner $2. 
Officials predict it could jump to $28 per year in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the average resident is probably unaware of the threat of this form 
of pollution, storm drains collect some of our most toxic forms of pollutants 
and put swimmers, people who fish, and marine life in direct contact with the 
contaminants," Bradley said.

INITIAL OK FOR BUILDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has given preliminary approval to a development agreement with 
Maguire Thomas Partners Development to build a four-story office building at 
1733 Ocean Ave. The site is currently occupied by the 40-year-old, three-story 
Flamingo Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 6 to 1 Tuesday night to approve the agreement. Councilman Ken 
Genser voted against the project. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, the Planning Commission was presented four options for the 
project, including allowances for a five- or six-story building. Maguire 
Thomas, which is building a 175-room hotel across the street at 1746 Ocean 
Ave., chose to seek approval for the development agreement, which locks in 
current building standards for the construction of a four-story, 56-foot high 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The development can be increased in height, however, if a draft design plan for 
the Civic Center area is released by March 1 and it permits structures taller 
than four stories, or if the General Plan is amended to allow buildings taller 
than four stories in the Civic Center area. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens advisory committee is drafting a design plan for the area bounded by 
Ocean Avenue, 4th Street, Colorado Avenue and Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas will be required to pay a $250,000 fee to a Civic Center and 
Ocean front improvement fund.

RENT SUBSIDY FUNDS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency on Monday approved $220,000 to augment its federally 
funded Section 8 program to assist an additional 40 low-income families with 
rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to assist households that have an income of between 50% 
and 80% of median income for the area, calculated to be between $20,850 and 
$31,099 per year for a family of four, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the federal government restricted eligibility for the Section 8 
program to include only those families with incomes up to 50% of the median, 
according to the report. The additional funding approved Monday would allow an 
additional 40 families to qualify for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Families assisted by the Section 8 program pay participating landlords about 
25% of their monthly income toward the monthly rent, and the program 
contributes the rest, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The program is intended to be a temporary measure to help the working poor 
become more self-sufficient by allowing them to devote more of their income to 
food, health care, and job training and education, according to Redevelopment 
Director Jody Hall-Esser. 
</P>
<P>
State community redevelopment law requires the agency to set aside funds for 
low- and moderate-income housing programs.

A NEW CINEMA OPENS IN AGOURA HILLS, 'THE TWO JAKES' OPENS IN VENTURA AND A REAL 
THEATER REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If four Mann theaters aren't quite enough, don't panic. The company will be 
opening another complex just south of the county line. An eight-plex cinema in 
Agoura Hills is expected to begin operation by the end of the month. It will be 
located on Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson's movie "The Two Jakes" opens Friday, and if any Ventura City 
Hall employees go to see it, they'll be seeing it for the first time. Although 
the film was partially shot at City Hall, apparently no one working there was 
invited to preview it. 
</P>
<P>
This follows the controversial filming itself -- which included Nicholson 
initially refusing a key to the city and then-mayor James Monahan having second 
thoughts about allowing another film crew to take over City Hall because of the 
disruption it caused. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Green, assistant to the city manager, said no filming is planned for the 
future, but there have been several inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Reviews of movies are everywhere. Reviews of movie theaters are not. 
</P>
<P>
But think about it: Is a great film still great when seen over a box of popcorn 
drowning in sludge? When you watch an Al Pacino performance from a seat with 
springs popping out, are you being moved in the way you'd want to be? These 
issues become all the more important when you consider that a movie such as 
"Die Hard 2" is playing in three theaters in the same county. Where exactly 
would you rather go see it, proximity notwithstanding? 
</P>
<P>
So, here it is, the first in a series of consumer guides to the theaters of 
Ventura County. First up by luck of the draw -- the Carriage Square Theatre on 
West Gonzales Road in Oxnard. The movie: "Die Hard 2," of course. 
</P>
<P>
Food: All the usual candy, plus hot dogs, ice cream (Haagen-Dazs and Bon Bons), 
cookies, soft drinks and popcorn. The hot dog was a tad on the salty side, but 
it was big enough to curb a mild hunger. The popcorn was no better than fair. 
Warning: We went to the first show on a weekday and asked for buttered popcorn 
and a hot dog. The butter wasn't ready before the first show and, though some 
could be seen rotating on the grill, neither were the dogs. We grabbed one on 
the way out. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: So clean that during a bad movie we'd be tempted to just hang out in 
it. The whole room is painted in bright yellow, a little too bright, maybe, but 
it'll sure force the eyes to adjust quickly after the film. Only one little bit 
of graffiti. Plenty of soap in the liquid soap dispensers, but that's probably 
because it takes a load of patience to get any out. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie Muzak: On this day, strictly the '70s, highlighted by "The Hustle" 
and "Killing me Softly." 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: One 
</P>
<P>
Previews: Two 
</P>
<P>
Seats: Quite comfortable and firm. None of that mushy stuff that keeps 
chiropractors in business. Best feature -- the wide, plastic arm rests with 
built-in cup holders. LEO SMITH

MENTAL HEALTH, JUVENILE SERVICES CUTS ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors' decision Tuesday to hold off on a proposed 
$39.7-million countywide cutback in mental health services saved about a dozen 
San Gabriel Valley mental health clinics from immediate closure or severe 
reductions of service. 
</P>
<P>
The board also held off on imposing $1.94 million in cuts to juvenile programs 
that would have affected counseling programs at the Boys Club of San Gabriel 
Valley in El Monte and Boys Republic in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
But by tying the future of the county's mental health budget to passage in 
November of Proposition 134 -- the statewide, 5-cent-a-drink alcohol tax 
initiative -- the board created uncertainty in the clinics for the next three 
months, social service providers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the good news is we have a breather," said Wayne Soucy, executive vice 
president of Pacific Clinics, a mental health counseling service that operates 
in four San Gabriel Valley cities. "It gives us more time for a rational 
approach to curtailment, if that occurs." 
</P>
<P>
But Soucy said the uncertain funding "creates tremendous uncertainty in the 
minds of patients." 
</P>
<P>
"Literally, it's bothering all of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley clinics that have been given a three-month reprieve include 
the Almansor Center in South Pasadena, Foothill Community Mental Health in 
Glendora, La Puente Valley Mental Health Center in La Puente and Mid-Valley 
Community Mental Health Center in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
The action taken Tuesday by the supervisors keeps current mental health funding 
levels in place until Nov. 15. Statewide mental health budget cuts imposed last 
week by Gov. George Deukmejian, coupled with a county mental health budget 
deficit of $10 million, would have meant about $8 million in cuts to San 
Gabriel Valley mental health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
But with about $32 million in mental health funds expected if the alcohol tax 
initiative passes Nov. 9, the board decided to hold off on mental health cuts 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a big gamble," said Ann Stone, associate director of the Los Angeles 
Mental Health Assn. Stone added that mental health care providers will now turn 
their efforts to lobbying for passage of the tax measure to save the state's 
ailing mental health system. But Soucy said he fears that some ads by the 
liquor industry against the tax measure "are so negative and so misleading they 
could sway the public." 
</P>
<P>
If the measure doesn't pass, the county will have to impose even greater cuts 
in November. If that happens, clinics will be hit even harder, Soucy said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision to keep current funding of juvenile programs was similarly 
tied to state action, said John Farley, division chief of the County Department 
of Community and Senior Citizen Services. 
</P>
<P>
State legislators in September are expected to amend Senate Bill 2433 to 
provide money for the juvenile programs. Even if they do not pass the measure, 
Farley said, county money is available to provide $1.9 million to juvenile 
service contractors, such as the two in San Gabriel Valley, and an additional 
$10 million to the county probation department for its juvenile programs.

JENNINGS WILL NOT SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William H. Jennings, who has served on the Santa Monica City Council since 
1979, announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection this fall. 
</P>
<P>
His decision means that two of the three council seats up for election on Nov. 
6 will be open. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed will be the only incumbent seeking reelection. 
Councilman David Finkel is stepping down to run for municipal judge in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings, an attorney, said in a prepared statement that he decided not to seek 
a fourth term for family reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 12 years, I have devoted a great deal of time to this city, to 
issues of concern to me and to our residents," he said. "Now I would like to 
spend more time at home with my wife and children." 
</P>
<P>
The filing deadline for candidates for City Council is next Wednesday at 5 p.m.

WESTSIDE PROJECTS ON BOND MEASURE; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: VOTERS WILL DECIDE IN NOVEMBER WHETHER TO FUND IMPROVEMENTS OF PARK, 
RECREATION AND CULTURAL FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A host of Westside projects would be funded by an $817-million bond measure 
placed on the November ballot Tuesday by the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, the largest bond act in the county's history, gives voters the 
chance to decide whether to increase property taxes to improve local park, 
recreation and cultural facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 3 to 1 Tuesday to place the omnibus bond act before voters. It 
would pay for projects ranging from a restoration of trout and steelhead 
habitats to a $35-million refurbishing of the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the measure would also distribute $140 
million to the county's 86 cities and to unincorporated areas to spend as they 
see fit. Each community's portion of this money would be based on its 
population. For example, the city of Los Angeles, with a population of 3.4 
million, would get nearly $52 million; tiny Hidden Hills, with just 1,981 
residents, would draw $32,703. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the proposal includes $81.5 million for acquisition of land and 
trails in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes $50 million to upgrade facilities at county beaches. This work 
is to include improvements to public restrooms and lifeguard towers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the rest of the money has been designated for specific smaller 
projects, including many on the Westside. The following is a list of those 
projects: 
</P>
<P>
* $15 million for acquisition and development of the Kenneth Hahn State 
Recreation Area in the Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* $10 million for the development of Pan-Pacific Park in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
* $10 million for improvements at Venice Beach, including walkways and trails, 
and for improvements at Venice Boulevard Park and Ballona Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
* $5 million for the trout and steelhead project, which would include Malibu 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
* $3 million for improvements at Santa Monica beaches. 
</P>
<P>
* $2 million for restoration of the Highland-Camrose bungalows in Hollywood, a 
part of the $35-million Hollywood Bowl project. 
</P>
<P>
* $1.5 for improvement of the John Anson Ford Theater in Hollywood, also a part 
of the bowl project. 
</P>
<P>
* $500,000 for development of a nature interpretive center in Malibu Canyon.

PLAN TO MOVE SHERIFF'S COPTER SQUAD MOVE FROM L.B. IS OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona City Council has voted to oppose a plan by the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to move its helicopter squadron from Long Beach Airport to 
Brackett Field in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
The move to nearby La Verne would "jeopardize the safety, security, peace and 
quiet of the residents of Pomona," the council declared Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The department is considering moving its squadron to La Verne because of a rent 
increase at Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. Lee Baca said the move would require approval of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors after public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the move is at least a year or two away and that the squadron 
has operated without complaint from neighbors in Long Beach. "We don't fly 17 
helicopters all at the same time," he said.

program. 
</P>
<P>
Murrell, who became coordinator of the city's extensive CPR program in 1984, 
has trained and supervised more than 100 volunteers who have taught CPR to more 
than 30,000 people. The city requires that all graduates of Beverly Hills High 
School pass a CPR class. 
</P>
<P>
The city program is funded by the Beverly Hills Citizen CPR Committee, which 
receives its money from community donations.

OPENING FOR LAVISH POST OFFICE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The much-anticipated opening of the lavish new Beverly Hills Post Office on 
Maple Drive has been delayed at least until October, postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-story structure, which will include underground parking, is nearly 
complete, but construction crews apparently underestimated the time it would 
take to finish the final phase of the project. 
</P>
<P>
When the post office is finished, it will become the main postal facility in 
Beverly Hills, replacing the one on Crescent Drive. Postal officials said 
Beverly Hills residents can expect faster mail service once the building is 
completed because city postal workers will move back there from their temporary 
office in West Los Angeles.

NO DAMAGES FOR AIRPORT NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court has refused to overturn an appeal court decision 
denying homeowners near Burbank Airport the right to collect damages for 
emotional distress or property damage caused by aircraft noise, airport 
officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruling leaves 600 plaintiffs from Burbank, North Hollywood and 
Sunland with "no more avenues of appeal that we can see" in the 7-year-old 
case, said Erich Luschei, attorney for the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court justices gave no reason for refusing to reopen the case, airport 
spokesman Victor J. Gill said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the plaintiffs' attorney, John J. Schimmenti, expressed little hope 
that the state high court would take up the appeal but said that he would try 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
He was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, plaintiffs contended that planes using the airport inflict noise 
on their houses, lowering their property values. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that this amounted to "inverse condemnation" -- the practical 
equivalent of a government agency taking away property by condemning it -- and 
that they should be compensated. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the airport convinced a trial judge in 1988 that noise from 
the airport peaked in 1973 and has since declined as a result of the 
introduction of quieter jets. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert I. Weil ruled that, under state law, homeowners 
could not file suit after 1978, five years from the point at which noise 
reached its highest level. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases were filed in 1983, five years after the authority bought the 
airport from Lockheed Corp. and a decade after the noise peaked. 
</P>
<P>
Weil further ruled that, since the cases were not filed within the prescribed 
time, the airport had acquired a "prescriptive avigation easement" -- a 
permanent right to continue flying over the affected properties. 
</P>
<P>
In May, a state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles upheld Weil's ruling that denied 
property damages and also found for the airport on the lesser issue of 
emotional damages. 
</P>
<P>
Weil had ruled that the handful of plaintiffs who live close to the airport in 
an area where noise levels exceed state standards could sue for personal 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
However, the appeal court ruled that, since the airport had acquired avigation 
easements, it "cannot thereafter be required to compensate the plaintiffs for 
its use of the easement." 
</P>
<P>
Luschei said that the next step will be a hearing before Weil, probably in 
October, at which the authority will request the dismissal of all claims. 
</P>
<P>
He said the authority, as part of a cross-complaint, will ask Weil to order 
that "a declaration of the airport's right to continue operating at its 
historical, or highest known, noise level" be recorded on the title of each of 
the nearly 300 properties owned by plaintiffs.

BOND WOULD DOUBLE SIZE OF WILDERNESS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wilderness park in the Whittier Hills would more than double in size if 
county voters approve an $817-million bond issue in November, preserving 
indefinitely some of the last prime hillside land untouched by development in 
eastern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The county bond issue would set aside $15 million to add about 300 acres to 
Whittier's 200-acre Hellman Park and preserve it as wilderness. Land would be 
bought with $10 million of the bond, and $5 million would go toward such park 
improvements as trails, picnic facilities, parking lots and access roads. 
Whittier would be responsible for maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The extension of Hellman Park would stretch across a hillside noted for steep, 
rugged canyons, 150-year-old oaks and sycamores and a climate of cool, moist 
nights and dry, balmy days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a special area," said Dave Cowardin, president of Friends of the 
Whittier Hills, a conservation group that has long sought to bar development in 
the hills. "It's an interface between the coastal basin, which experiences fog, 
and the desert. It's unique as an example of what was once common in the Puente 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Mayor Thomas K. Sawyer and Councilman Robert F. Woehrmann attended the 
County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday to lobby for the parks measure, as 
did Assistant City Manager Manny Ocampo. 
</P>
<P>
Ocampo said developers and major landowners have not opposed the idea thus far 
because their land would be bought at market value. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue would be paid for by increased property taxes, an average 
increase of $10 a year for a property with an assessed value of $125,000, said 
Esther Feldman, spokeswoman for the Mountains Recreation and Conservation 
Authority, which wrote the bond issue after consulting with political and civic 
leaders across the county. 
</P>
<P>
Three groups compose Feldman's organization: the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, the Conejo Recreation and Park District and the Rancho Simi 
Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue includes money for parks and recreation programs in all county 
cities and also specifies particular projects, such as the Whittier Hills, for 
special financing. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said the park idea fit perfectly into what the bond issue seeks to 
accomplish, because the hills are a regional resource whose preservation has 
strong public and private support. 
</P>
<P>
The land has been so desirable that only a unique combination of factors has 
left more than 2,500 acres of these hills intact. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationist Cowardin said that most of the terrain has a slope of 50 
degrees or more: "That's unbuildable for most people. And the Whittier 
earthquake fault moves right through there." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rose Hills Memorial Park Assn. owns large sections of nearby 
hillsides and has maintained open space around its cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor limiting building has been Whittier's longstanding hillside 
ordinance to prevent overdevelopment of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the hills remain unincorporated county territory and thus outside of 
Whittier's direct control. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just an anti-development issue," said Councilwoman Helen 
McKenna-Rahder said. "It's a pro-preservation issue. In Whittier, we have an 
area that gives us an ocean breeze and an edge on the smog and the traffic."

FAMILY FARE: VOILA CAFE; 
</P>
<P>
THIS TREAT'S REAL; 
</P>
<P>
HERE'S A RESTAURANT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO PRETEND ITS FOOD IS GOOD -- EVEN THE 
KIDS WILL LIKE IT.

<P>
Eating in a restaurant that was once a house always reminds me of having a tea 
party in a playhouse. Except that here my orders are obeyed, the food is real 
and I don't need to sip air from the cups. 
</P>
<P>
Voila Cafe makes a particularly nice playhouse. The restaurant inhabits a 
little blue California stucco house with striped awnings. A splendid array of 
bright golden sunflowers grows just outside. Inside, the restaurant -- which 
calls itself a bistro cafe -- is light, airy and comfortable. And although it 
is right on a four-lane road overlooking a lumber yard, it sits high up on a 
knoll so it doesn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant isn't fancy; in fact, my 7-year-old nephew Billy Jon was the 
only one of us with the presence of mind to don a suit and tie for dinner 
(along with his tennis shoes). As it turned out, this was just the sort of 
occasion that was worth dressing up for. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli soup, a sort of liquid souffle, gave a hint that the vegetables at 
this restaurant were going to be superb. It was followed by a wonderful baked 
chevre -- a generous salad of crisp romaine and raw vegetables topped with a 
good portion of warmed, pungent goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
When the entrees arrived, each plate was heaped so high with carrots, broccoli, 
potatoes and zucchini that it looked as if we had all ordered the same thing. 
But beneath those brightly colored vegetables, the entrees proved to be varied 
and imaginative. 
</P>
<P>
Tender pork medallions came with hot slices of apple in a mild brandy cream 
sauce. Filet Madrid was an excellent steak in an exciting sauce of red peppers, 
fresh tomatoes, onions and cilantro. The snapper had a ginger curry sauce in 
which the ginger almost eclipsed the curry. It went particularly well with the 
carrots. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken with hearts of palm was a new take on the familiar piccante flavor that 
goes so well with chicken. Summer pasta consisted of chewy penne noodles with 
olive oil and Parmesan cheese, bountiful slices of good onions, mushrooms, 
broccoli and big, succulent shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Jon liked his dinner -- but it was the desserts in the case that really 
impressed him. "Let's just break the glass, take them and run," he suggested. 
We had a little trouble persuading him to enjoy his dessert at the table. 
</P>
<P>
A giant slice of flour-less chocolate cake, made with ground walnuts and 
espresso, was rich but not too sweet, with a very dense texture. The creme 
brulee, was too sweet for me, and it lacked that usual crust of caramelized 
sugar. It did, however, contrast nicely with the fresh raspberries with which 
it was served. But I loved the carrot cake with its big nut morsels, a 
wonderful chewy moistness and a frosting in which a hint of tartness chased 
after the sweet. 
</P>
<P>
We argued over whether this restaurant could be considered a place for family 
fare. I pointed out that I'd never seen the kids eat so much or so well. But 
Billy Jon gave the deciding vote. Wiping his hands on his shirt, he leaned back 
against the seat and said, "I'm having the time of my life."

ART: COUNTY FAIR POSTERS; 
</P>
<P>
BUMPER CROP; 
</P>
<P>
THIS YEAR, THE POPULAR VENTURA COUNTY FAIR POSTERS WILL FEATURE AN ANTIQUE 
BUMPER CAR.

At first he might look like any old poster car. But upon closer inspection, 
said Devlin Raley, the creative director behind the Ventura County Fair 
posters, you can see that "he" has much more personality. 
</P>
<P>
Like "any well-done poster, the more you look at it, the more you see in it," 
said Raley. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at those red lines on the front," Raley said pointing at his creation. 
"See how they form a benign grin? That provides a great dichotomy. On the one 
hand, bumper cars are those scary rides that toss you around. Yet here's this 
car smiling at you. 
</P>
<P>
"And although he's friendly, you can see he's sturdy and strong. There's almost 
a machismo about him. I mean, if this guy asked to buy (a woman) a drink, of 
course (she) would say yes." 
</P>
<P>
As senior partner of Creative Images in Ventura, Raley has designed the past 10 
fair posters and the last two posters for the Oxnard Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the fair posters were simply a promotional tool. They were 
put up around town to advertise the event. But since then, the hot-selling 
posters have grown into collectors' items. 
</P>
<P>
"We've created a monster," said Raley, who now has the task of trying to wow 
the public each year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always terrifying in January and February when I start thinking about 
what to do. And then, eventually, an idea will just come to me about a month 
before the poster has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
A lover of antiques, Raley tries to incorporate them into his work whenever 
possible. So when this year's fair theme of "A Timeless Tradition" was decided 
upon, an antique bumper car was a natural. 
</P>
<P>
Raley said he usually doesn't use a picture that represents just one aspect of 
the fair, such as the midway. But bumper cars have been a fair tradition for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, another antique, and another midway favorite was used for the poster 
-- the Dentzel carousel horse. That poster was the start of the collector 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave about 3,000 posters out to the businesses so they could put them up in 
their windows to advertise the fair," Raley said. "But then we noticed that 
they weren't staying in the window. People were taking them home and framing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
From then on, an additional 2,000 posters were printed on higher-quality paper 
and sold at the fair. And the free promotional posters were punched with a hole 
so that they would not compete in value with the collectors' item. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 to 1990 posters are available at the Ventura County Fair 
administration office for $15 each. The 1986 picture of a tide pool was sold 
out, and there are no plans for a second printing. The 1985 carousel horse also 
sold out. But that poster went through a second printing, as indicated on the 
posters, and costs $50 at the administration building. 
</P>
<P>
Original first-printing carousel posters pop up sporadically at local art 
galleries. Raley and some gallery owners said they have seen them priced as 
high as $250. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Arnold, owner of Classic Frames and Art Gallery in Ventura, said he would 
take a gamble and buy an original 1985 carousel horse for about $30 and try to 
resell it. JoAnna Steele, owner of the Studio Gallery, said she would consider 
paying $50 to $100 for an original in mint condition. 
</P>
<P>
The carousel horse has proven to be the most popular poster, but the 1986 tide 
pool was the most difficult to make. 
</P>
<P>
In his quest for authenticity, Raley insisted on using live sea creatures, such 
as starfish and urchins. Fresh water had to be added continually, and about 12 
experts in handling ocean life crowded his small studio. 
</P>
<P>
Not including the construction of the box, the tide pool scene took two days to 
set up and about two hours to photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Authenticity was a major factor in this year's bumper car poster as well. After 
Raley located an antique car, he pored over old popular magazines and trade 
publications to try to find a picture of that particular model. He finally used 
a photograph from a 1940 Saturday Evening Post to aid in the car's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I could have cheated and had the car done in any colors and design I 
wanted," he said. "But if I'm cooking and a recipe calls for butter, I'm not 
going to use Parkay." 
</P>

DREAM SCHOOL;

<P>
EIGHT VENTURA COUNTY STUDENTS FIND THAT THERE'S A SUMMER SCHOOL RESEMBLING THE 
MOVIE "FAME."

Their time has not quite run out, but already you can hear Danica Rinaldi, 
Pablo Weiss and company slipping into reminiscence about this dream summer of 
1990: school, six days a week, in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"It really surprised me," said Rinaldi, a 17-year-old who usually does her 
studying at Simi Valley High School. "Everybody understands you. It's not like 
regular high school, where people say, 'Art -- is that the only thing you have 
to talk about?' It's going to be really sad when we leave." 
</P>
<P>
She spoke from Mills College, where the final days of the California State 
Summer School for the Arts were drawing near. So did Pablo Weiss, an 
18-year-old June grad from Chaparral High School in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"The only assignment we had was to make a cup," he said wistfully of his 
ceramics class. "No boundaries, no limits." 
</P>
<P>
The four-year-old program, which offers hands-on instruction from professionals 
in the visual arts, music, dance, theater and writing, is staged by the state 
and supported by student fees and contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty includes such working professionals as actors Charles Haid and Beau 
Bridges and contemporary California artist Gilbert Lujan, who teach under a 
program that is less formal and has longer hours than are found in most public 
schools. Students pay up to $1,000 each, but many this year were subsidized by 
$110,000 from the private, nonprofit California State Summer School for the 
Arts Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
This year, said Director William Cleveland, the school attracted 1,000 
applications and, after interviews and evaluations of work samples, accepted 
395 students. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of those came from Ventura County. Beginning July 14, they heard lectures 
and hammered together self-portraits. They jammed around a piano just like the 
kids in the movie "Fame." And they pondered the ins and outs of censorship, 
just like those grown-ups in Congress and at the National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Okamura, 17, of Rio Mesa High School in Camarillo, came to study visual 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
"In my sculpture class, they gave us three hours to construct a sculpture, a 
self-portrait," she said. "I had to stumble through all the castaway materials 
in the studio and put together something that said something about myself. So 
we were scrambling and hammering and burning ourselves with glue guns. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the seat of an old chair, with a screen on it, and I nailed it to a 
triangle piece so it had a tilt to it. And to the chair piece, I nailed these 
green berries. And I painted on the screen. And behind the screen I put an 
oleander flower. On one side of it I wrote Ignore This and on the other I wrote 
Pay Attention." 
</P>
<P>
The piece, she said, is about "the way I feel masked by ideals that society has 
kind of brainwashed everyone about." 
</P>
<P>
April Shafer, 14, from Redwood Junior High School in Thousand Oaks, came to 
study dance -- and her fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
"The creative writers, like, are very different from the visual arts people," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The creative writers are more into school," she said. "The visual artists are 
more withdrawn and they have more of an artistic temperament. It's a good 
experience, so we'll know what other people are like." 
</P>
<P>
Shafer, not quite five feet tall, said she started taking dance when she was 4, 
as therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
"It really helped my joints, and after that I just got serious with it. When I 
decided I really wanted to take my dance seriously was when I was about 8 or 
9," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm the second youngest one here, but age isn't that important. I have 
a couple friends from dance, one from theater and one who's a singer and we 
just sort of hang out at this place called The Grill. It's where a lot of the 
kids hang out. There's a piano there, and some of the kids play, and some are 
singing, and some of the dancers make up dances." 
</P>
<P>
Theo Rubinstein, 16, of Thousand Oaks High School came to study theater. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to start with a clean slate, trust my teachers, and let them lead me. It 
was hard to trust them at first. But it was one of the best acting classes I've 
ever taken," Rubinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
He studied stage combat, physical comedy, storytelling and movement, and came 
away, he said, with a new view of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found out a lot of weaknesses I have," he said. "I speak too fast, I have 
what they call happy feet -- I have trouble finding strength in being still, as 
they say. I have good comic timing. I think I'm extremely good at 
improvisations. And I found out that I'm a lot better at serious dramatic 
scenes than I thought I was." 
</P>
<P>
And, as seems inevitable in the arts these days, there was politics. Pablo 
Weiss and classmate Mike Schiller, a 17-year-old ceramist from Davis, set up 
letter-collecting boxes so students could write government officials to oppose 
artistic censorship in the distribution of National Endowment for the Arts 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
But summer school ends soon -- the last day of the program is Saturday -- and 
all that may soon fade. The artists of summer last week were laying plans for 
the coming school year and speculating about colleges and jobs. Several were 
thinking of the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. Pablo Weiss was 
talking about working in an Oregon firefighting camp to make some money. 
</P>
<P>
And Theo Rubinstein, aspiring actor, had career considerations in mind. He'll 
be getting an agent in the next few months, he said -- as soon as the 
orthodontist takes his braces off. 
</P>

8 COUNTY STUDENTS GET A SUMMERTIME FEEL FOR THE ARTS 
</P>

For almost a month now, eight Ventura County students have been living in 
dormitories at Oakland's Mills College and attending the California State 
Summer School for the Arts. This is how some of them spent their summer 
vacation: 
</P>
<P>
* Working in ceramics, Pablo Weiss created an Amazonian chief, who sits naked 
on a couch, watching a nuclear bomb explode on television. The couch sits on a 
map of South America; the TV set, atop a miniature Aztec temple. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's kind of a metaphor for how Indians want couches and things these 
days," Weiss said, "and how they may be oblivious" to the damage technology 
does to the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
The program, Weiss said, gives them "intermittent theory -- lectures and slide 
shows. But for the most part, we're really cranking out the work, and getting 
our money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Sunwoo, 16, who will be a junior at Oxnard High School this fall, 
took classes in photography, design and drawing, and video, learning to work 
with moving images and a 4-by-5-inch still camera for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of projects you can't finish during class. You have to come after," she 
said. On the nights she wasn't coming in after class, there were on-campus film 
screenings to consider. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Citizen Kane,' or 'The Fabulous Baker Boys,' or 'Doctor Strangelove' -- they 
try to accommodate everybody's tastes," Sunwoo said. "Today is 'Children of a 
Lesser God.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Paul Disbrow, 17, of Simi Valley High School, studied visual arts -- and was 
struck by the teachers' attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"You can talk to them on a one-to-one basis and really feel equal," he said. 
"They don't say, 'Well, that's not quite what I had in mind.' They let you do 
what you want to do, and I think that's one of the most important things."' 
</P>
<P>
* "I made this saber-toothed tiger with armored stuff on it," said Jeff 
Plamenig, a 17-year-old visual arts student from Simi Valley High School. "And 
I have this armored rider on it, and he's holding on to a staff with a blade on 
the end. He has a helmet on, with horns on the top. I just thought it up." 
</P>
<P>
Plamenig took courses in ceramics, design, printmaking and drawing, along with 
an Issues in Art discussion group that met at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to get up early around here," Plamenig said.

HEALTH: BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS GATHER AT CITY OF HOPE TO MARK THEIR 
SUCCESSFUL FIGHT AGAINST ILLNESS. THEY ALSO REMEMBER THOSE WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT.

Tears welled up in Alma Andrade's eyes as she watched her favorite celebration 
take shape underneath a large party tent at the City of Hope National Medical 
Center in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I wait for every year," said the 21-year-old Los Angeles 
resident, her voice cracking as children and adults all around her laughed and 
hugged each other. "To me it's more special than birthdays, Christmas or 
anything else. It's another year that I live." 
</P>
<P>
Andrade is a bone marrow transplant recipient, one of about 200 who gathered at 
an emotional reunion last week to celebrate their recovery from leukemia, blood 
disorders and other life-threatening diseases. Many, including Andrade, came 
with the sibling who had donated the marrow to save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes family flew out from Mesa, Ariz., to mark 9-year-old John Hughes' 
third anniversary since his transplant. While John romped around on the lawn 
with his brother and bone marrow donor, Matthew, now 11, their parents recalled 
the traumatic years that began when John was diagnosed as having acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really upsetting time for the whole family," said John's mother, 
Petey. "I had to get a nanny to take care of the (other) kids. I'd come (to 
City of Hope) and stay for a week. Mike (her husband) was able to leave Fridays 
and stay during the weekend. Sometimes we'd meet each other in the airport and 
switch keys right there." 
</P>
<P>
At the reunion Friday, television cameras and reporters surrounded City of 
Hope's second-longest transplant survivor, Marilyn Gaffney, who came with three 
of the four children she has adopted since her transplant 13 years ago. Because 
of the massive doses of chemotherapy and radiation she received in preparation 
for her transplant, Gaffney could not bear children. 
</P>
<P>
These were the lucky ones, said Dr. Stephen Forman, director of City of Hope's 
department of hematology and bone marrow transplantation. There is only a 
one-in-four chance siblings will have matching bone marrow types. 
</P>
<P>
Forman asked for a moment of silence in memory of those who weren't so 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the people not with us today," Forman told the crowd of about 500 as 
they munched on sandwiches, rolled video cameras, and snapped photographs with 
doctors and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Forman recalled the first transplant survivor's party 14 years ago, when a 
handful of nurses and doctors gathered in the patient's room and celebrated 
with a birthday cake. In succeeding years, the hospital cafeteria served as the 
party room, and nurses would make spaghetti and hang a pinata, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is still largely a family affair, but that may change soon because of recent 
advances in matching unrelated donors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, finding an unrelated bone marrow donor -- a one-in-20,000 
chance -- was virtually impossible. Now, there are computerized registries to 
match unrelated patients and donors across the nation and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope next year we'll have patients and donors here who are strangers," 
Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients took turns at the microphone to talk about the diseases that almost 
took their lives. Some thanked their doctors and nurses. Others wept openly. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to forget the bad part, and remember the good part," one former 
patient said. "Thank God we're all here."

NEW TRIAL SOUGHT OVER REDEVELOPMENT GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: A COALITION OF LANDOWNERS WANTS THE PROJECT AREA COMMITTEE 
REINSTATED. THE ADVISORY PANEL WAS DISBANDED BUT CONTINUES TO MEET WITHOUT CITY 
RECOGNITION.

<P>
A small group of Hollywood property owners, claiming to have documents damaging 
to the Community Redevelopment Agency, has gone to court to reinstate the 
Project Area Committee, the onetime official citizens advisory panel on 
Hollywood redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Endangered Property Owners, an informal coalition of several dozen 
landowners, filed a motion Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court for a new 
trial in a 15-month-old dispute over the status of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which continues to meet without city recognition, had become the 
primary mouthpiece for critics of the 1,100-acre renewal effort when the Los 
Angeles City Council voted last year to disband it. Hollywood-area Councilman 
Michael Woo, a strong supporter of redevelopment, said at the time that he 
could not work with the panel, which he described as a "forum for wacky 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the property owners group said this week that they have documents 
showing that the drafters of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan intended for the 
committee to remain in existence for the life of the 30-year redevelopment 
project. A court hearing on the motion is scheduled for Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"The Project Area Committee was the only representation we had," said Don 
Lippman, leader of Endangered Property Owners. "When they were disbanded, we 
became very, very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Liu, who owns two buildings and operates a restaurant in the 
redevelopment area, said property owners are looking for protection from the 
agency's power of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have the right to do what we want with our own property," Liu said. 
"If we don't want to sell it, we should have the privilege not to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
City and CRA officials have argued that the redevelopment plan guaranteed the 
Project Area Committee's existence for just three years following City Council 
approval of the renewal project in 1986. The council officially abolished the 
committee in May, 1989, and replaced it with a separate group appointed by Woo. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the Project Area Committee's 25 members refused to disband, 
opting instead to challenge the City Council in court. Last December, Superior 
Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin rejected claims by the group that the council's 
action violated state law and the redevelopment plan. Lewin refused a second 
bid in January by the committee to overturn the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Bruce Tepper, who represents the CRA on matters involving Hollywood, 
predicted that the city and agency would prevail again. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge has spoken twice," Tepper said. The members of the Project Area 
Committee, he said, "have had every opportunity to come up with this evidence, 
and it has never shown up. This process has been through a sifting and 
examination the likes of which no other redevelopment plan has ever been 
through. The process has worked." 
</P>
<P>
Woo described the latest legal action as "a headache that won't go away," and 
he blamed it on a small group of Hollywood activists bent on undermining the 
renewal project. 
</P>
<P>
"It is evidence of the continuing effort on the part of a handful of people to 
prevent Hollywood from being improved through the redevelopment process," Woo 
said. "We will move ahead and not let these legal procrastinators try to hold 
us up further." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, members of the Project Area Committee on Tuesday formally 
appealed Lewin's ruling on their case to the state Court of Appeal. Committee 
member Ruth Goulet said the group "anguished over this for some time," 
particularly because of the high costs of an expected court battle. The group 
passed a hat to collect the $200 filing fee. 
</P>
<P>
"We just decided it is an outrage that we cannot have," Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND The Hollywood Project Area Committee was set up in 1983 to help the 
Community Redevelopment Agency prepare a renewal plan for central Hollywood. 
When the Los Angeles City Council adopted the plan in May, 1986, the citizens 
committee became largely an advisory group, making recommendations to the 
agency on proposed developments and other issues involving the $922-million 
renewal effort. But in elections in late 1988, redevelopment critics gained a 
majority on the 25-member committee, often putting it at odds with the CRA and 
Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo. At Woo's urging, the council voted to 
disband the committee in May, 1989, and replace it with an appointed panel 
selected by the councilman. The council's action was upheld in court, but 14 
members of the committee continue to meet and call themselves the Hollywood 
Project Area Committee.

AN AD FOR BACKWOODS TYPES; ELVIS FANS CELEBRATE; VENTURA BOOKSTORE MARKS 40 -- 
OR IS IT 50? -- YEARS

This personal ad, submitted by a Ventura woman, is running in the July/August 
issue of Backwoods Home Magazine: 
</P>
<P>
"Independent woman, age 47, wants independent man to build our own house, 
generate our own electricity and grow our own food." 
</P>
<P>
What is the independent woman going to be doing? 
</P>
<P>
What is Backwoods Home Magazine? 
</P>
<P>
It's a bimonthly magazine published out of Ventura that focuses on "saving the 
environment," said distribution manager Eric Batie of Camarillo. "It's a how-to 
magazine on solar and water preservation and conservation." 
</P>
<P>
The year-old magazine has a nationwide circulation of about 4,000, with the 
majority of subscribers in California and Oregon. The latest issue covers such 
topics as ferro-cement water-storage-tank building, blueberry canning, 
wind-generator Qs &amp; As and old-tool revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
As if we actually had to remind anyone, Elvis International Tribute Week (a 
9-day week at that) will begin Saturday. Fans worldwide, perhaps universe-wide, 
will mark the occasion in their own way. But the official celebration will take 
place at Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo resident Theresa Carpenter will be among the people gathering at the 
King's former castle. It will be the second pilgrimage for the 31-year-old 
postal clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter has been a fan since grammar school, but she considers herself a 
novice. "There's still a lot of learning and understanding left for me," she 
said. "There are people who knew him and grew up with him, and I'm learning 
from them. I wonder if there's enough time to learn everything." Favorite Elvis 
flick: "King Creole" (1958). "He was young and real alive and full of energy," 
Carpenter said. "It was a real good part and a real good story line." She said 
she has the tape and watches it frequently with her 5- and 6-year-old 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Favorite Elvis recording: "How Great Thou Art" (1966). "Just talking about it 
gives me goose pimples." 
</P>
<P>
Most prized Elvis memorabilia: A brick from his 1956 Memphis home. "I was at a 
charity auction last year, and here's this raggedy old junky piece of brick," 
she said. "It really grabbed me." It sold for $35. 
</P>
<P>
Let's wish a happy birthday to the Ventura Bookstore on Main Street. How many 
candles on the cake? 50, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Elrod and Kent Weigel, who have owned the business for 11 years, thought 
this month would mark the store's 40th year. But it seems that the Ventura 
Bookstore bought out, or took over, the Blendine Bickel bookstore, which was 
around in 1940. Hence, the extra decade. 
</P>
<P>
That ancestry came to the ownership's attention when a 90-year-old local woman 
presented them with a book bearing a sticker that gave the Bickel name and 
phone number. That phone number was the same as that of the Ventura Bookstore 
before it relocated May 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem," said Elrod, "is that most of the people who had good memories at 
that time don't have good memories now." 
</P>
<P>
What they are looking for is hard evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has come in with receipts or canceled checks," Elrod said. "There's 
stuff like that out there, the trick is to find it. Some people save that kind 
of stuff." Readers? LEO SMITH

WHEELCHAIR ATHLETE PICAZO PAINTS A WINNING PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
ATHLETICS: INJURED IN A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT EIGHT YEARS AGO, CULVER CITY 
RESIDENT MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. A. ADANDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joaquin Picazo of Culver City can't get around without a wheelchair, yet 
doesn't consider himself handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically challenged," Picazo said. "That's the term I like to use." 
</P>
<P>
And it fits. Since a motorcycle accident left him wheelchair-bound eight years 
ago, Picazo has come to view life not in terms of impossibilities but as a 
series of challenges. He has maintained an active lifestyle swimming, playing 
tennis and basketball, and participating in 10-K races. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at sports as an outlet," Picazo said. "There are a lot of things we can 
do even though we're in a chair." 
</P>
<P>
Picazo's first exposure to wheelchair tennis came four years ago, when a friend 
invited him to watch a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up a racket that day, started hitting some balls and I fell in love 
with it," he said. "I haven't put the racket down since." 
</P>
<P>
A month later, using his mother's old wooden racket, he entered the U. S. Open 
Wheelchair Tennis Championships, the largest event of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Picazo advanced to the third round, but more important, the competitive fire 
that had died out after the accident was rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
Picazo is now a member of the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis, which 
sponsors tournaments, clinics, exhibitions and camps. Wheelchair tennis players 
follow the standard rules of the International Tennis Federation, the sole 
exception being that the ball can bounce twice. Picazo is in the A Division, 
the second-most difficult of the foundation's five skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
Picazo uses two different wheelchairs -- one with a lower seat for greater 
speed and maneuverability for playing tennis and a higher wheelchair which is 
better-suited for rebounding and shooting basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
Picazo likes to defy the limited expectations placed on people in wheelchairs 
in an effort to prove, as he likes to say, that "we can do more than roll over 
people's toes." This yearning to do the unexpected was part of Picazo's 
personality long before he lost the use of his legs. In fact, it's the reason 
he's in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
Picazo started racing motorcycles at 15 and turned professional two years 
later, becoming one of the circuit's youngest riders. He left the sport and 
came back to it at 19 with high aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be a champion," Picazo said. "The year I got hurt was supposed to 
be a promising year for me." 
</P>
<P>
That year was 1982 and Picazo was racing at Saddleback Park in Orange on a 
Saturday as part of the four-race California State Series. The course contained 
a new challenge, a triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was jumping two (jumps) and rolling over the third one," Picazo 
said. "I said to myself, 'On the last lap, I'm going to go for it and try to 
clear all three of them.' There's only a few riders who would attempt something 
like that, and I was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
On the final lap, Picazo accelerated as he neared the triple jump. As he went 
airborne, he could tell something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew once I hit it that I was a little off, but I tried to correct it in the 
air," he said. "My rear wheel hit the third jump and I flipped over. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I knew, I woke up, I was on the ground and I couldn't move. I 
could move my hands, but I couldn't move my legs." The injury was diagnosed as 
a compression fracture of the T-6 vertebrae, or a broken back. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was seriously hurt at the time," Picazo said. "I was in such 
good shape, I knew no matter how badly I was injured I could pop right up 
because of the physical strength that I had. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the hospital and the doctors told me I damaged my spinal cord. At 
the time, I had no idea what that meant. I said, 'Whatever. Just patch me up so 
I can get back in the race on Sunday.' They told me, 'Joaquin, you're never 
going to walk again.' 
</P>
<P>
"So there I was, 21 years old, and someone was telling me that," Picazo said. 
"I said, 'No possible way. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in a 
wheelchair.' They didn't know me; they looked at me like a statistic. There was 
no way I could accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Picazo began a self-designed recuperation program consisting of crawling, 
sit-ups and bar-assisted standing, while he visited chiropractors and 
acupuncturists in his native San Diego. But the results weren't very 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"As the months went by, my legs weren't moving and I said, 'Wow, maybe I'm not 
going to walk again,' " Picazo said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus reconciled, he didn't waste much time adapting to his new life. He won the 
wheelchair division of a two-mile "fun run" six months after the accident then 
took up swimming, basketball and, later, tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, still in San Diego, Picazo saw a newsmagazine piece on 
television about the Walker Institute, an innovative rehabilitation center in 
the Pacific Palisades. He sent for information and, after two days of muscular 
and cardiovascular testing, was accepted into the program. He moved to Culver 
City, where he resides today. 
</P>
<P>
Using electromyography, a computerized biofeedback system, the institute 
discovered that muscles in Picazo's legs previously considered inactive were 
actually functioning, and designed a strengthening regimen for him. 
</P>
<P>
Picazo has progressed to the point where he now walks 1,200 feet a day with leg 
braces, but says he won't be satisfied until. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to walk without the wheelchair," he said. "My goal is that, no 
matter what. I don't have a Plan B." 
</P>
<P>
Picazo often visits schools to lecture children about sports opportunities 
within the physically challenged life. He recently organized a wheelchair 
tennis tournament in the Pacific Palisades to promote interest in the sport, 
and last year was named director of recreation at the Walker Institute, where 
he teaches tennis and basketball to other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a really good instructor because he's really patient and he's really 
thorough," said Alicia Hatorn, who has been taking lessons from Picazo since 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Judith Walker, the institute's founder and director of medicine, said that 
sports provide a necessary outlet for the patients, most of whom are between 
the ages of 18 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
"It really gives them a lot of confidence," Walker said. "Many people don't 
think they can do it until they get the coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in wheelchairs spend time being bored, not knowing there are 
things they can do. With adaptive equipment, they can do a lot of things that 
able-bodied people can do." 
</P>
<P>
Picazo is living proof of that. With a body that is still athletic, he deftly 
spins, accelerates and coasts in his chair. He would like to be a champion in 
tennis, but if he fails he said it will not be the end of the world. Living in 
a wheelchair has taught him how to keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, (the accident) is the best thing to happen to me," Picazo said. 
"I used to be really into motor racing and be really arrogant, always trying to 
beat other people. Now I've learned to love. I've learned to share and to think 
about other people." 
</P>
<P>
His new outlook doesn't go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real positive," Hatorn said. "He helps all the patients to be real 
positive and to get more out of life. He just helps you to see that you can do 
whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're in a wheelchair.

FISHING;

<P>
ANGLERS ARE LOADING UP ON DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It appears this summer's sportfishing season could set a record for unusual 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
Recent storms off Cabo San Lucas have pushed the exotics north. 
</P>
<P>
Fluctuating water temperatures have brought dorado and giant squid to Southland 
beaches and close-in fishing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The dorado prefer the warm water. Now these fighters are being caught by local 
party boats. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Toronado and Phantom got into a wide-open dorado bite 
Tuesday morning. The Phantom returned with 140, a limit for its 14 anglers. The 
Toronado had to get through the kelp patties, where line-slashing yellowtail 
were hiding, and decked 25 yellows and more than 100 dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun and Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor have been catching dorado 12 miles 
out and scored with more than 100 Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Southern Cal was fishing for sand bass at the power 
plant when the boat found what deckhand Myron Ackerman described as an invasion 
of giant squid going up to 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The anglers hooked 23 of them and the crew scooped the small ones for bait. 
Anglers baited the small ones and caught 23 yellowtail that weighed up to 20 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran party boat captain Cookie Cook said in his 50 years operating South Bay 
party boats he has never witnessed such a strong showing of dorado and giant 
squid so close to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Big game fish anglers might even see some tackle records broken. Art Laffey of 
Rancho Palos Verdes was trolling on his boat Kelley-Fish 30 miles from Avalon 
using a mackerel clone jig when he had a blind strike, then the battle began. 
For 30 minutes Laffey had to move the boat, holding the fish with his 80-pound 
test line. Finally it tired and aboard came a big-eye tuna. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first tuna weighed in this season at the Avalon scales. It went 222 
1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Gilman and Richard Murray of Wilmington had three successful days of 
fishing at Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Murray fought a marlin for one hour and 40 minutes while Gilman kept busy 
fighting a big dorado. The marlin weighed 436 pounds and the dorado and even 
70. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Friedman of Torrance returned from a one-day albacore trip fishing 90 
miles out aboard the Conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman reeled in nine yellowtail, four skipjack, one dorado and one albacore. 
</P>
<P>
She lost the jackpot when a 40-pound class tuna that she was reeling in for 25 
minutes parted the line as it was ready for the gaff. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Jarrett Makem of Gardena, fishing off San Clemente Island 
aboard the Toronado, caught the whopper of the week, a 30-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Pattie Bown of Torrance, fishing at the rigs aboard the Sportking, caught a 
19-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Walters of Long Beach snagged a squid that weighed 18 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Chudakoff of Lomita, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the horseshoe 
kelp, caught a 16 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Blue of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Victory at the rock pile, caught an 
11-pound bonito. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports -- Big bonito have moved into all areas. The local sand bass bite 
remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished Venice reefs and anglers 
caught 50 bonito, 40 calico bass and 25 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman on a half-day trip returned with a catch of 160 bonito and 11 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in a catch of 220 rock cod, three cow cod 
and a lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Sumo fished the bay and anglers caught a variety -- 105 bonito, 49 sand 
bass, 25 barracuda, three cabazon, three sculpin and a halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray's trip to rocky point found bonito, with 
anglers sacking 186, plus 93 sand bass and a yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack worked Catalina Island for 193 bonito, 36 calico bass and 32 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Redondo on a half-day trip returned with 175 bonito and 40 sand 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special half-day trip resulted in 80 bonito and nine barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The barge Isle of Redondo scored with 2,220 mackerel, 240 bonito and three 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
22nd Street Landing: The First String fished Catalina and chalked up 211 
barracuda, 78 bonito, 48 calico bass and seven yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Monte Carlo on a half-day trip returned with 91 bonito and 51 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: Anglers on the Sportking trip to the horseshoe kelp 
sacked 132 barracuda, 107 bonito and 10 yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits fished Catalina for 200 calico bass, 76 bonito and 10 dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory fished the rigs for bass and scored with 
141 calico bass, 140 sand bass and 91 bonito. 
</P>

PAYSINGER TACKLES NEW JOB AS HEAD COACH AT BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This spring was a particularly tough time for the Beverly Hills High football 
program. Memories remained from the bitter teachers' strike in the fall, which 
resulted in the forfeiture of three games, the resignations of longtime 
Co-Coaches Dick Billingsley and Bill Stansbury to accept jobs at other schools 
and the cancellation of spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
"All anyone could talk about was transferring out of here," junior Ziv Gottlieb 
said. "I was looking into the possibility of either transferring to Crespi or 
Loyola. I figured this program was going nowhere. We didn't even have a coach." 
</P>
<P>
The traditionally powerful Normans seemed like a team on the decline. But 
morale took an about-face in mid-June when Principal Ben Bushman promoted 
veteran assistant Carter Paysinger to head coach. The selection was 
overwhelmingly popular with the players. 
</P>
<P>
"Naming Carter as head coach was a dream that I thought would never come true," 
said Gottlieb, who will start at quarterback this season. "I can't think of 
anyone who would have been better. When we heard the news about Carter, 
everybody in school was doing high-fives. He's always been a players' coach and 
that's why we all like him." 
</P>
<P>
Bushman's decision appears to have been a wise one. No one ended up 
transferring and more players are expected to go out for the team this fall 
than did last season. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger's appointment is unprecedented because he is the first alumnus and 
part-time faculty member to coach football at Beverly Hills. He also is the 
first black to head the football program. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it hasn't been a racial problem and frankly, I don't anticipate it to 
be one," Paysinger said. "People here know me and know what I'm about." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger has been an assistant at Beverly Hills since 1980, but there are 
several obstacles he must overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions remain from the teachers' strike and the subsequent failure of 
Proposition B, which would have raised $4.5 million for the Beverly Hills 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury and Billingsley walked the picket line last fall, leaving the team 
without any coaches for three Bay League games. The Normans had to forfeit 
those games and ended the season at 3-7, failing to qualify for the playoffs. A 
few months later, Billingsley was informed by the district that budget cuts 
likely would result in the elimination of his teaching and coaching position. 
He accepted a job at Oak Park High. Fearing further cutbacks, Stansbury also 
jumped ship and took a job at Paso Robles High. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger, who played football and baseball at Beverly Hills from 1971-74, has 
taught physical education at the school since 1985, but he was on a leave on 
absence last year to devote more time to his financial brokerage business. He 
remained a football assistant, coaching the quarterbacks and receivers and 
helping put together the offensive game plan. 
</P>
<P>
When Bushman called in June and offered Paysinger the job, he needed only a few 
hours to make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been an assistant so long, that I couldn't pass up an opportunity to 
finally be in charge," said Paysinger, who will teach two classes at Beverly 
Hills this fall and continue his job as a broker part time. "Despite my busy 
schedule with my business, I am making time for this because I want to see how 
I do when I'm calling the shots. I guess when you're an assistant for so many 
years, you always wonder how you'll do when you become the head coach. It's 
time to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, though, the strike business is over and it's time for 
a clean slate. I think that whole thing is finally behind us now." 
</P>
<P>
Putting together a coaching staff was Paysinger's first task. Within days of 
his promotion, his staff was intact. He rehired his brothers, Vonzie and Donald 
Paysinger, as assistants. Vonzie, an assistant at Beverly Hills since 1983, 
will be the offensive coordinator, and Donald, an assistant since '82, will be 
the offensive line coach. He also hired Brian Cook, a former defensive back at 
Carson High who went on to play at USC. Cook will be in charge of the defensive 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when I wasn't sure if I would return," Vonzie said. "It all 
depended on who was going to be the head coach. If the school would have hired 
a new guy from the outside, I wasn't too excited about starting the program all 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I wanted my brother to get his chance. When they selected Carter, I 
knew I would be back. I'm excited about this year, and also my increased 
duties. I was ready for a bigger role." 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury praised his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Carter is very bright, personable, has excellent rapport with the athletes and 
is a very knowledgeable football person," Stansbury said. "Hiring him was the 
best thing for the program because there will be continuity." 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing spring drills, the Normans have been back to a normal schedule 
since Paysinger took over. Most of the returning players currently are enrolled 
in a six-week physical education class at the school, which is taught by 
Paysinger. Players spend two hours each morning on the practice field running 
through plays and discussing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger appears comfortable in his new role and said few changes are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue running a pro-style offense," he said. "The only change on 
defense is that we will platoon. We will be more aggressive on defense and 
force the action instead of waiting for it to come to us. But all of the 
terminology will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger, 34, said the biggest difference his players will notice this season 
is that they will be able to have open discussions with the coaching staff. 
Although he said Stansbury and Billingsley had a good rapport with the team, he 
said he is more low-key and less of a disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not much of a yeller," he said. "I just talk to the kids on a relaxed 
level, and I want them to feel like they can do the same with me. All of 
coaches are like that, so I think it will be a very positive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger isn't ready to make any predictions on his team's chances this 
season, but like most coaches, he is optimistic. The Normans return five 
starters on offense and four on defense. Seniors Darren Smith (wide receiver) 
and Greg Holmes (running back) are considered college prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"All you can do is give your players the best opportunity to perform," 
Paysinger said. "What happens on the field is up to the players. At this point, 
I'm not nervous about wins and losses. 
</P>
<P>
"But give me a little time."

'GISELLE': THE ESSENCE OF ROMANTIC BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES ORANGE COUNTY DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making its first United States tour in 14 years, the Australian Ballet is 
bringing a mix of classical and modern works to the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa from Thursday, Aug. 9, through Sunday, Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
First up are performances of the full-length ballet "Giselle," along with a new 
work, "Catalyst," by Australian choreographer Stephen Baynes, Thursday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The engagement will conclude with a program of mixed repertory on Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Different casts will be seen on each occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Regarded as the essence of the Romantic ballet movement, "Giselle" tells the 
story of a young girl who dies of a broken heart after learning that the man 
courting her is engaged to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
In the famous second (or "white") act, in which the corps of women appears in 
white tutus, the spirit of Giselle saves the life of the man (Albrecht) who 
deceived her when he is threatened by an avenging band of Wilis, or spirits of 
women jilted by their lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Music for the ballet is by French composer Adolphe Adam, known also for writing 
"Cantique de Noel" (O Holy Night). 
</P>
<P>
Anna de Cardi will dance the title role of "Giselle" on Thursday at 8 p.m. 
David McAllister will be her Albrecht. Mark Brinkley will be Hilarion; Michele 
Goullet will dance Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis. The Peasant pas de deux in Act I 
will be danced by Linda Ridgway and Stephen Woodgate. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda Coney and David Ashmole take over the roles of Giselle and Albrecht, 
respectively, at 8 p.m on Friday. Steven Heathcote will be Hilarion. The dancer 
for Myrtha will be announced. De Cardi and Andrew Obst will dance the Peasant 
pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
Baynes' "Catalyst," which is set to Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos, also 
will be danced on both programs. 
</P>
<P>
The company will turn to a mixed repertory program consisting of three works at 
2 and 8 p.m. on Saturday and at 2 p.m. on Sunday. The ballets will be: 
</P>
<P>
* Serge Lifar's "Suite en blanc," a neoclassical showpiece created in 1943 for 
the Paris Opera Ballet and set to Lalo's music for the ballet "Namouna." 
</P>
<P>
* Jiri Kylian's "Return to the Strange Land," an elegiac series of pas de deux 
and pas de trois set to Janacek piano pieces. (Kylian's solemn and cathartic 
"Forgotten Land," to music by Britten, was danced by the San Francisco Ballet 
at the Center in October, 1989.) 
</P>
<P>
* David Lichine's "Graduation Ball," a comic one-act work in which the young 
girls of a Viennese boarding school hold a party to entertain the cadets of the 
nearby military academy. There are several divertissements and a secret 
romance, all to the music of Johann Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor at all performances will be John Lanchbery, who was music 
director for American Ballet Theatre in the late 1970s. 
</P>

THE CORNER BAR: TROPICANA GIVES TARZAN SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, OK . . . so it's a yuppie joint. The bright colors, the funky cartoon mural 
splashed across one wall and the Southwestern menu that's heavy on Mexican food 
are dead giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tropicana Bar and Grill, located on the ground floor of the newly 
opened Casa Tropicana Bed and Breakfast, has a definite charm that makes a 
visit for one of the bar's various happy hour specials or for a late night 
snack a pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
One can sit leisurely under the thatched roof that wraps around the short bar 
and sip tropical drinks or the latest fad, Trestles Beer, while getting a 
fantastic birds-eye view of the pier and the surfers below. 
</P>
<P>
The prices -- unlike those of the establishment's bed and breakfast rooms above 
-- are not astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
The menu ranges in price from a generous helping of Trop Fries for $1.95 (fried 
in peanut oil for added flavor) to a double order of Ragin' Cajun Garlic Ribs 
for $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
The only disappointments are the so-called specialty drinks, a selection of 
fruity concoctions with names like Bahama Mama, Seal Rock Cooler and Tropicana 
Sunset. They seemed too watery and sugary -- especially at $3.75 and $4 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Rock Cooler, for instance, contains lemon-flavored Stolichnaya vodka, 
Midori melon liquor and triple sec. But it tastes more like lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
The daily happy hours, from 4 to 7 p.m., may turn out to be the bar's biggest 
draw. There are no free eatsto complement the drinks. But the dollar beers and 
two-buck margaritas have a definite appeal to most seasoned happy hour patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Casa Tropicana is a bed and breakfast inn, the bar and grill offers 
something most other drinking establishments lack: breakfast. But only on the 
weekends. Omelets range from $4.95 to $6.95, and other egg dishes run about $6. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most memorable feature of this trendy bistro is enjoyed only by 
the female patrons. In the ladies room is a mural of Tarzan sailing through the 
air on a vine. When visitors to the restroom pull down his loincloth, they get 
a peek at the Jungleman's BVDs. 
</P>
<P>
But they also activate a tape in the bar that fills the room with Tarzan's 
trademark yell. (There you have it, guys. The mystery is solved. And you 
thought they played the yell whenever the bartender got a good tip.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Tropicana Bar and Grill, 610 Avenida Victoria (across from the San 
Clemente Municipal Pier), San Clemente. Open Sundays through Thursdays till 11, 
Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. (714) 498-TROP. JAMES M. GOMEZ

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SONIC DRIVE-INS ARE TEXAS-SIZED BLAST TO THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a kid in Texas, I regarded the Sonic Drive-In hickory burgers, cheddar 
cheese-drizzled tater nuggets and root beer floats as staples of teen-agers' 
diets across the Lone Star State. So, when a Sonic opened in Westminster, you 
betcha this misplaced Texan was, like, totally stoked. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every aspect of this drive-in is perfect. From the Texas-sized drinks 
(even the straws are big) to the bodaciously hot-to-handle onion rings, this 
restaurant chain's blast to the past is a fun and surprisingly inexpensive 
adventure. Pull in underneath the turquoise-and-white canopy and park next to a 
red-and-white squawk box. With the sounds of Chubby Checker drifting from the 
rafters and hot neon signs screaming "onion rings," you might not be surprised 
to find prices that are out of an earlier decade as well. Big burgers run a 
couple of bucks, Coney dogs cost a buck and a quarter, fries are pretty cheap 
($1.16) and are cooked in low-cholesterol oil, too. (Some blasts from the 
present cannot be avoided when attempting to convince yuppies to order an extra 
bag of fries.) 
</P>
<P>
The service is snappy. Red-vested car hops practically sprint to each station 
while balancing red trays stacked high with burgers wrapped in foil-paper. 
(That's what burger joints used before Styrofoam and other insidious, 
multisyllabic containers were invented.) 
</P>
<P>
In the way of extras, for thirst-quenching relief from the heat, try a limeade. 
It's a bubbly concoction of lime juice squeezed into club soda and poured over 
those little round ice pellets -- nice and cold, very refreshing. And for the 
non-frozen yogurt crowd, a Sonic Blast. Take an extra thick milkshake and smash 
your favorite candy bar into it. Awesome sugar blast, dude. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever your taste buds crave, if you're hungry and on your way home from the 
beach or heading out for a meal, the Sonic Drive-In cooks up mean burgers, 
Coney dogs and chicken-fried steak sandwiches that will leave you a-hootin' and 
hollerin' under the stars, chowing down in your car to the beat of the Beach 
Boys. Sonic Drive-In, 15640 Brookhurst St., Westminster. Open Sundays through 
Thursdays, 10 a.m. to midnight; Fridays and Saturdays till 1 a.m. (714) 
531-8000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic Drive-In, 1632 N. Lemon St., Anaheim. Hours are same as above. (714)

<P>
* Cafe Zinc, 350 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-6302. Open Mondays from 7 
a.m. to 11 a.m.; Tuesdays through Sundays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
A Berkeley-style cafe in Laguna, Cafe Zinc has remarkable, densely foamed 
cappuccino; fresh, imaginative muffins like millet or cranberry; and an outdoor 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
* Heritage Brewing Company, 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714) 
240-2060. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight; Fridays 
and Saturdays to 2 a.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
This brewpub is a rowdy place with dart boards, foosball and a young, 
party-crazed crowd. If the beer had any flavor at all, one could even call the 
place lively. Four brews are offered -- pale ale, golden ale, Irish red and 
Dana porter -- along with a variety of salads, finger foods and sandwiches, the 
best of which is "beef on wick," wafer-thin roast beef on a salted bun. The 
burgers aren't bad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAJUN 
</P>
<P>
* Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5 
to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is Orange County's only bona fide Cajun 
restaurant. The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. Indulge 
yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden flavors; 
oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and spicy 
tomato; and stuffed trout, pan-fried in pure butter. Blackened items are a 
must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
* China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. 
(714) 526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 
to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, ultra-modern 
dining room in Fullerton's spanking new Metro Center. But there is nothing 
tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the most 
accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and first-rate 
soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged steaming into an 
ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies you can have in 
between are too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
* Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., No. 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 9 a.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
A vast Hong Kong-style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is 
beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the 
capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both 
food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black-pepper beef brisket from the 
Page 1 specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first-rate kung pao 
dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy-sauce squab. On a menu with 150 
entrees, there is much to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTINENTAL 
</P>
<P>
* The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point. 
(714) 240-5008. Open nightly for dinner from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$$ 
</P>
<P>
A meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton is always a memorable experience, 
but in some instances the memories tend to be a bit flawed. Amid the beautiful 
surroundings, elegant service and well-heeled clientele, chef Fabrice Canelle 
has introduced a creative, eccentric and imperfect cuisine, a blend of French, 
Californian and international influences. The menu is small, and dishes have a 
tendency toward the sweet. Salads, Sonoma duck liver, lamb and outstanding 
desserts are the hallmarks. 
</P>
<P>
* The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open 
Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through 
Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies 
rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer 
pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is 
like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of 
avocado immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled 
marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on 
the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines 
and bistro-like desserts. The ambiance is relaxed and casual. 
</P>
<P>
* Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. 
(714) 750-4321. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays 
through Saturdays from 6 to 10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant, but other aspects of dining 
there can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room 
is predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad and 
some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the mouth 
and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is extensive and 
intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CUBAN 
</P>
<P>
* Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open seven 
days a week from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban-style 
cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa rellena 
(a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs) is the best appetizer. 
Roast chicken Cubano (a crispy half-chicken with bitter orange peel added for 
extra dimension) is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert -- it is 
the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery 
suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker 
blush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENGLISH 
</P>
<P>
* The Cat and Custard Cup, 800 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-3812 or 
(714) 996-6496. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; 
Mondays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Tuesdays through Fridays to 10 p.m.; Saturdays to 
10:30 p.m.; and Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m. $$

<P>
The Cat and Custard Cup is a lovingly reconstructed English pub with a campy 
Continental menu and dark, medieval trappings. It is charming, cheerful and 
worth a wide detour.

<P>
* The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755. 
Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through 
Thursdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
* La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
$$$ 
</P>
<P>
Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants 
advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge 
more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and 
salad included in the prices of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything 
without sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more 
accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade 
chicken-liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here too. 
</P>
<P>
* La Vie en Rose, 240 S. State College Blvd., Brea. (714) 529-8333. Open 
Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 6 to 10 p.m. 
$$$ 
</P>
<P>
La Vie en Rose is supposed to be fashioned after a Normandy farmhouse, but the 
building is a masterpiece in kitsch; it looks like a swap-meet replica of the 
Mont-St-Michel abbey. Luckily, the food is good. Spinach salad sizzles with 
natural flavor. Salad perigourdine (a simple dish of mixed greens with slices 
of preserved duck and a heady garlic dressing) makes a terrific lunch. Fish is 
prepared with delicacy. The veal chop is wonderful. Service is flawless and 
attentive. The only major drawback is the noise level, which befits, well, a 
swap meet. Moderately expensive. 
</P>

GREEK 
</P>
<P>
* Greek Cuisine, 13011 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 731-1179. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; daily from 5 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
* Flamingo, 17185 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 964-0016. Open 
Tuesdays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 11 
p.m. $20 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic eateries in mini-malls: Greek Cuisine in Tustin boasts exquisite taramo, 
creamed carp roe, fall-off-the-bone oregano chicken and a fine array of Greek 
specialties, while Flamingo in Fountain Valley is more terra incognita: seco 
norteno (piquant lamb stew in onion gravy), papas a la Huancaina (potatoes in a 
cheese-sauce blanket), picarone (hot pumpkin fritters in blackstrap molasses). 
Both restaurants are casual and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDIAN 
</P>
<P>
* The Clay Oven, 15435 Jeffrey Road, Irvine. (714) 552-2851. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Clay Oven is an Indian restaurant inauspiciously located in a country 
shopping mall and specializing in dishes from the tandoor, the authentic oven 
advertised by the restaurant's name. Fish tikka, here made with chunks of 
broiled swordfish, is downright heavenly, and tandoori chicken, rubbed red with 
a spice mixture and broiled until sizzling, is another winner. There is an 
interesting selection of vegetable dishes as well. Wash everything down with 
giant bottles of imported Indian beer and lament the fact that most of the 
really exotic specialties you see displayed on the menu won't be available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDONESIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Dewi, 1762 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (714) 637-1101. Open Tuesdays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m to 8 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Hurry over -- while there is still time -- to Dewi, a small Indonesian 
restaurant/grocery store hidden among commercial properties along a busy avenue 
in Orange. Nasi rames is a mixed rice plate with a whole cookbook full of 
Indonesian goodies, and the restaurant has fabulous barbecued chicken and hot 
stewed-beef dishes. Owner Edith Vredevoogd is constantly preparing little 
snacks such as lemper (a sticky rice roll filled with minced chicken) or cendol 
(mysterious green bits taken with crushed ice, syrup and jackfruit). Don't 
despair if you miss the restaurant, though. There is a second Dewi run by Mrs. 
V's brother in Huntington Beach. Exotica at its best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Agostino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8266. Open 
Tuesdays through Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
This Chicago-style Italian restaurant is famous for its homemade sausage and 
romantic beach view. Much of the menu, including the rich, creamy pastas, is 
the same as it was when the place was called Sabatino's. But Agostino has added 
many seafood dishes, including mussels, fresh salmon and calamari. The bar is 
as good a hangout as you'll find in Capo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* Capriccio Italiano Ristorante, Village Mall, 25380 Marguerite Parkway, 
Mission Viejo. (714) 855-6866. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 
2:30 p.m. and from 4 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 4 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Capriccio may mean "whim" in Italian, but there is nothing whimsical about the 
food in this restaurant; it is polished and sophisticated. For my money, it is 
a real find. The kitchen is run by two brothers from Palermo, Sal and Franco 
Maniaci, but there is barely a trace of Sicilian influence in the dishes they 
serve. Appetizers like vitello tonnato and lumache del bosco are marvelous, and 
pastas are fresh and homemade. Many main dishes have French overtones, like a 
stylish lamb rack with truffles and foie gras, or a civet of hare called lepre 
salmi. Cappriccio's location is modest, and so are prices, but its class is 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
* Prego, 18420 Von Karman Ave., Irvine. (714) 553-1333. Open Mondays from 11:30 
a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays to 11 p.m.; Fridays to midnight; 
Saturdays from 5 p.m. to midnight; Sundays from 5 to 10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Prego, 4 years old, remains one of the area's most impressive Italian 
restaurants. The exterior is that of a Tuscan villa; inside, it's elegant and 
neoclassical. The kitchen serves mostly northern Italian fare that is all the 
rage now: homemade pastas, rotisserie meats, sumptuous desserts. It's best to 
stick to basics here -- wood-fired pizzas, terrific roast duck and lamb. 
Service ranges from gracious to arrogant, but there are plenty of excellent 
Italian wines to toss around. 
</P>
<P>
* Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open 
Mondays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 
from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Service is fluid and solicitous at this smart, stunning restaurant, located in 
the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is having 
its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin olive 
oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables and 
bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello (veal chop with 
fontina and prosciutto) is one reason to go back for a second look. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE 
</P>
<P>
* The Food Court at Yaohan Market, 665 Paularino Ave., Costa Mesa. (714) 
557-6699. Most concessions open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for a crash course in contempo Japanese, look no further 
than Yaohan Market in Costa Mesa and its colorful Food Court. Several 
concessions are in full swing here, serving a variety of Japanese lunch and 
snack foods, including bento (Japanese lunch box), ramen and curry rice; 
there's even a bona fide sushi bar. You also will find a bakery that serves 
Japanese versions of such Western dishes as clam chowder and spaghetti -- and 
many curious, puzzled customers. Good, cheap fun. 
</P>
<P>
* Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 6 to 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays from 
5 to 11 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an 
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into 
a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of 
Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful 
$14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per 
person, is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEXICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days a week, 11 
a.m. to midnight. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new 
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest 
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red '80s-chic motif 
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen and a comal (a high-tech 
version of a stone tortilla cooker). The restaurant smokes its own meats, and 
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila. 
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful.

SECOND HELPINGS: A TUSTIN BISTRO THAT'S BECOME A SHEEP OF A DIFFERENT COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Orange County restaurant critic Max Jacobson often returns to restaurants 
he has found lacking to see whether things have improved. This is one in an 
occasional series of "Second Helpings." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's Black Sheep Bistro has always been one of the coziest, most charming 
little restaurants in the county. Now it is also one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
Rick and Diana Boufford, the couple who bought it last year, have retained the 
restaurant's unpretentious look and embellished it with a few personal touches. 
The comforting robin's egg blue tablecloths and gingerbread house wooden chairs 
are still in place, but the walls have become a veritable travelogue of 
impressionistic country scenes into which you'd like to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
You could disappear into this menu, too, which centers on the Mediterranean and 
the south of France. Rick is an excellent chef who has done his homework. His 
menu is simple and intelligent, and his food bursts with the flavors of the 
French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Try regional delights like fresh foie gras, confit of duck or cassoulet or 
bourride, dishes that pop up on his list of daily specials. Or perhaps a 
sumptuous paella for two, cooked in the traditional manner with saffron, 
seafood and homemade sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Saffron never tasted better than it does in Boufford's mussels a la maison, 
tiny mussels steamed in white wine, garlic, capers, tomatoes and herbes de 
Provence. And you must try one of the chef's flame-broiled meats, such as 
magret of duck or grain-fed lamb, served with your choice of several Provencale 
sauces that Boufford makes without cream or butter. 
</P>
<P>
Wine drinkers will be astounded at the restaurant's wine list; it looks like a 
wine collector has opened his private cellar to the public. In essence, that is 
what has happened. Boufford has been collecting wine for 18 years, and here you 
will find everything from an '86 Nalle Zinfandel to a '78 Gaja Barbaresco. This 
remarkable list is just one more surprise in what may be the most surprising 
little restaurant in which you will eat this year. 
</P>

NEWSBITES: BOUNTIFUL, BOUNTIFUL HUNTINGTON BEACH

The focus near the Huntington Beach pier these days is not just on surfing. The 
area's on its way to becoming a destination point for diners. The brand new 
Waterfront Hilton is open, with its ocean-view Cielo Mare restaurant. It serves 
breakfast, lunch and dinner daily, accenting Mediterranean fare, prepared by a 
French chef. Average dinner price: $21. The hotel is at 2100 Pacific Coast 
Highway. Reservations: (714) 960-7873. 
</P>
<P>
Peppers Golden Bear, across Pacific Coast Highway at the peach-and-teal, 
four-level Pierside Pavilion, will open Aug. 20. Bearing the same name as a 
legendary nightclub that once presented the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Janis 
Joplin, if features a 500-seat concert venue as well as a dining room for 280. 
In either area, you can savor Norteno (North Mexican-style) fare, with such 
sizzling platters as mesquite-broiled fajitas served with Alaskan king crab 
legs or lobster tail. And there's more, from super burritos to baby back pork 
ribs. Concert/dinner packages are available. Peppers Golden Bear will be open 
daily, beginning with a happy hour from 4 to 8 p.m. (with a free 30-foot 
display of appetizers) and offering dinner and entertainment till 2 a.m. Sunday 
brunch also is planned. This is the Southland's third Peppers. The others are 
in the City of Industry (also a concert hall) and Garden Grove (restaurant 
only). Information: (714) 969-3434. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Aug. 10, is the scheduled opening of Johnny Rockets, also in the 
Pierside Pavilion. Franchisers are Paul Wimmer and Bill Schroeder, owners of 
Maxwell's just across PCH at the pier, plus Ben Hobberman. It's a '50s-style 
diner concept, with cooked-to-order hamburgers, a variety of sandwiches and 
made-with-real-ice-cream malts and shakes. The jukeboxes will play '50s and 
'60s tunes, and the staff (wearing the traditional fountain hats) will perform 
skits to some of the records. Johnny Rockets started in West Hollywood on 
Melrose and now has locations in Beverly Hills, Westwood and Sherman Oaks. The 
Huntington Beach franchise is the first in Orange County, but Wimmer, Shroeder 
and Hobberman plan to open another in November in Fashion Island. For info in 
Huntington Beach: (714) 536-2111. 
</P>
<P>
Still more from Wimmer and Schroeder: In September they'll unveil, also in 
Pierside Pavilion, the second-story, ocean-view (plus terrace seating) Main 
Street Bar and Grill. True, it's another dinner house, but while Maxwell's 
specializes in seafood, the Grill will concentrate, as the name suggests, on 
steaks and other grill items. An all-day a la carte menu, prepared in an 
exhibition kitchen, will price entrees from $6 to $20. The restaurant will be 
open for lunch and dinner daily, with a sit-down brunch on Sundays. (714) 
536-2101. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for an early September debut in the Pierside Pavilion: Amy's 
Deli, which will also feature its own bakery and a selection of wines. The 
Pavilion is at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo's Ristorante in the Westin South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, recently 
introduced a new, lower-priced, less formal, more comfortable dining style. New 
menus, developed by chef Wade Simpson, highlight, for dinner, a classic 
cioppino, smoked Italian sausage in egg and spinach ravioli with rosemary red 
pepper sauce, sauteed sea bass with fresh fennel, anisette and cream. (Entree 
prices: $10.25 to $23.50) The new luncheon menu includes potato gnocchi with 
pancetta and Gorgonzola, gazpacho primavera with shrimp and pesto sour cream. 
The price range is $7.25 to $11.25. Alfredo's traditional service and its 
naturally lit garden setting will not change. The Westin is at Bristol and 
Anton in Costa Mesa; (714) 540-1550. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH

MAX JACOBSON: ZEPPA: CHOCK FULL BY DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach is already chockablock with new Italian restaurants, and judging 
from the looks of things, more are on the way. The latest and most 
sophisticated entrant is Zeppa, a designer restaurant for designer diners. 
</P>
<P>
Zeppa, which means "chock-full" in Italian, has been just that for the two 
months that it has been open. The old Zeppa on Ocean Front Walk was a crowded, 
somewhat noisy place to dine, but certainly not in this league. Owner Mark 
Zigner couldn't have anticipated the throngs or the decibels when he moved the 
restaurant to Fashion Island. On weekends the fashion set stands four deep at 
the 50-seat bar, shouting over the live jazz and struggling to be seen in the 
latest Paris threads. Tables are fully booked until well after 10, and the 
crowd doesn't even begin to thin down until much later. 
</P>
<P>
It could be the design. When was the last time you sank down into a 
magenta-colored velour banquette under a gold leaf dome by a Romanesque arch? 
The faux-marble floor and splashy open kitchen look right out of Met Home. As 
if that weren't enough, Zigner has added something called Diva lights: wire 
lights from Milan that dangle over the tables like high-tech spiders. 
</P>
<P>
But it's probably the food. Chef Lou Manginelli likes to play with Italian 
recipes, infusing them with Oriental touches and putting a California face on 
them. I'd be tempted to say that Zeppa was not an Italian restaurant at all, 
were it not for the the fact that pastas are everywhere on this menu, along 
with other staples of the Italian kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
In the madness of the crowd, the front desk lost our reservation on a Friday 
night. They informed us (with profuse apologies) that the dining room would be 
full for at least another hour but that we could be seated on the patio within 
minutes. Actually, this proved to be a blessing. We soon discovered that the 
Beamers outside were making less noise than the people inside. 
</P>
<P>
We got lucky with the service, too. The kitchen, especially for such a busy 
restaurant, was lightning-quick that evening (although I'd found things 
somewhat slower at a previous lunch). It seemed that there were never more than 
five minutes between courses, and that our server, a real charmer, had constant 
help from a team of seasoned pros. 
</P>
<P>
A few dishes at Zeppa may seem a little overboard, but by and large this is a 
first-rate menu with some wonderful food. The appetizers are so tantalizing 
that it's hard to get to the other courses. Steamed Pacific mussels, the 
flavorful ones that are so much more delicate than New Zealand mussels, come in 
a fabulous tomato concasse that is thick with roasted garlic, green chiles, 
tarragon and pale green olive oil. It is the best dish the restaurant serves, 
bar none. 
</P>
<P>
But the fun hardly stops there. One of the holdovers from the old Zeppa is 
terrific calamari fritti, an extremely crisp version cut up into tiny pieces. A 
lobster-flavored black pepper mayonnaise makes this dish even more special, but 
because the pieces cool quickly they must be consumed immediately. And grilled 
tiger prawns, a Manginelli signature, are another must, smoky from mesquite and 
crowned with opal basil and an eggplant ragout. 
</P>
<P>
Pass on the bruschetta, a failed experiment -- the bread is heated rather than 
grilled, the fontina cheese too greasy, and the combination of red pepper and 
garlic aioli ill-conceived. And I'd allow only a grudging nod to the carpaccio, 
the raw beef relatively short on flavor and further weakened by a watery 
texture. If you're after something light, go for the grilled Japanese eggplant, 
a class act. The sweet, smoky-flavored eggplant is wrapped around smoked bufalo 
mozzarella and finished with a tomato pesto vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas here are not particularly light, sometimes swimming in butter or 
very rich sauces. But even the heavier ones taste pretty good. A special of 
angel hair with grilled scallops and Chardonnay cream barely missed 
immortality, done in by an excess of butter. The lobster tortellini had too 
much butter and tarragon in the sauce, but the dish was rescued by the 
deliciously sweet bite of the tortellini themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the pastas with no flaws at all. Penne with sausage. 
Tagliolini con gamberetto, thin pasta with spicy Thai shrimp and lemon grass. 
And cornetti tricolore, tri-color pasta with Gorgonzola, pine nuts and basil 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
The menu lists relatively few entrees, most prepared on the mesquite grill that 
wafts appetizing smoke your way throughout a meal here. They come with baby 
vegetables, and the veal and lamb chops come with eggy, sweet onion souffles. 
It's really quite a show. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmone alla griglia is a surprisingly good grilled salmon in a cinnamon-basil 
vinaigrette. The conceit of aromatic spices with mesquite grilling is inspired, 
and the salmon is cooked crisp without being dried out. The veal chop with 
garlic puree, leek straws and Cabernet essence is even better. This dish may 
sound precious, but I assure you, each component works like a charm. It's a 
magnificent, lusty chop in a glorious, ruddy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the negative stuff (you knew this couldn't last): The wine list here is 
relatively weak, with a small selection of California, French and Italian wines 
that do not measure up to the food from this kitchen. And desserts, while 
competent, are anticlimactic. There are a humdrum cheesecake and a few 
predictable gelati, plus zucotto, a slightly dry, domed chocolate cake with a 
dried fruit and cheese filling. The only thing worth saving your appetite for 
is the creme brulee with blueberries. 
</P>
<P>
Zeppa is moderately expensive. Appetizers are $4.50 to $8. Insalata are $5 to 
$8.25. Pasta are $10 to $21. Entrees are $17 to $22.

WATTS TOWERS AGAIN HAVE AUDIENCE OF THOUSANDS THANKS TO BLUE LINE

<P>
The blur of front yards, street crossings and corner markets flashing past the 
trolley car window gives way to a more curious sight as the Metro Rail Blue 
Line slows to approach the 103rd Street station. 
</P>
<P>
A trio of wispy-looking spires reach into the sky like the masts of a sailing 
ship moored incongruously in the middle of a sleepy neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The Watts Towers," explained a passenger on the train as his seatmate turned 
to stare on a recent day. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 years after Simon Rodia began troweling cement onto scrap-steel legs 
of his unusual sculpture, the railroad is once again giving the Watts Towers an 
audience of thousands. 
</P>

The self-taught artist toiled from 1921 to 1954, often suspended by a 
window-washer's belt from spidery, whimsical structures that eventually reached 
99 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Rodia had selected a tiny, triangular-shaped parcel at 1765 E. 107th St. for 
his project because it was bordered by what was then Los Angeles' busiest 
transportation corridor: two trolley lines that carried thousands of travelers 
daily between downtown and a dozen outlying communities. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted lots of visitors, that's why he picked a lot next to the Red Car 
lines," said Bud Goldstone, a structural engineer who has been involved with 
Watts Towers maintenance and restoration since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
But the towers were less visible after the historic Red Car lines were 
abandoned and the trolleys scrapped in 1961, isolating the Watts neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, there was a sign that advertised the Watts Towers to travelers on 
the Harbor Freeway. But it eventually disappeared and was never replaced. More 
recently, only a few scattered arrows on neighborhood streets pointed visitors 
to the site. 
</P>
<P>
Things are changing this summer, however. 
</P>
<P>
The month-old Blue Line from Los Angeles to Long Beach is once again carrying 
thousands of commuters past the towers. Some passengers have begun exiting at 
the 103rd Street station and taking the short walk to Rodia's masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Increased numbers of foreign travelers have also begun searching out the 
towers, prompted in part by new international guidebooks that list Rodia's 
creation as one of the Southland's architectural marvels. 
</P>
<P>
And federal officials are considering bestowing national landmark status on the 
towers, following the lead of state and local leaders who have declared them a 
historic monument. 
</P>
<P>
The increased attention has prompted city officials to more than double the 
number of weekly public tours at the fenced-in site on Saturdays and Sundays 
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city recently installed new directional signs and banners that 
promote the towers in the Watts area, "it was not easy" for visitors to find 
them, acknowledged Goldstone, whose wife, Arloa, is a volunteer tour guide. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove around for 45 minutes before I got here," said Natasha Bult, a 
Manhattan student who pulled up late one recent weekday afternoon. She said she 
learned of the towers in a Princeton University visual arts class. 
</P>
<P>
But Bult was dismayed that the gate was locked. Security guard Kevin Harris, on 
duty at the nearby Watts Towers Arts Center, urged her to return on the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Those taking weekend tours are rewarded with close-up views of the bits of 
glass, 7-Up bottle bottoms, seashells, broken pottery and tile chips that Rodia 
used to turn his concrete sculpture into giant mosaics. 
</P>
<P>
German playwright Jurgen Lemke of East Berlin listened intently as tour guide 
Ernest Walker explained how common kitchen baking molds were used to create a 
corncob look along one mortared wall. 
</P>
<P>
Tourist Tim Butler, a nuclear plant inspector from Aiken, S.C., said the 
do-it-yourself look is refreshing after "the glitter and glamour" that visitors 
see at other Los Angeles attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said metal reinforcing bars that have turned rusty where mortar has 
chipped and flaked away are being replaced. The strengthening work is expected 
to continue through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, scaffolding being used by repair workers gives the towers a 
rickety, temporary look that is worrisome to some visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand how you have the Getty Museum buying millions of dollars' 
worth of pieces from Europe and you're letting this fall apart. It's beyond 
belief," said tourist Ton Schaap, an architect and urban designer from 
Amsterdam. He described the towers as "fantastic . . . amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Added Vincent Borrelli, a Syracuse, N.Y., artist: "If this was in a wealthy 
suburban locale, I'm sure it would have gotten the proper attention long ago. 
Or maybe torn down. Maybe it's a mixed blessing it's here." 
</P>
<P>
The towers' Watts setting was part of their attraction to tourist John 
Borneman, a Harvard University anthropology professor from Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were in Beverly Hills, I wouldn't be interested. This is the only piece 
of art I'm visiting in L.A. during the three days I'm here," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Outterbridge, director of the Watts Towers Arts Center, the 
renovation has proceeded slowly because Rodia's work is "so special and so 
unorthodox -- there are no blueprints." 
</P>
<P>
Outterbridge said the towers' fame is worldwide. "We get calls from the State 
Department all the time about a group of 40 Russian scholars that are coming, 
for instance, or a group of aborigines from Australia." 
</P>
<P>
He said the resurrected trolley service has again put the towers within reach 
of many who might otherwise miss Watts -- including Southland residents. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach resident James Farrah said he and friend Laura Mahaffey of Garden 
Grove decided to get off the trolley and take a look after a fellow passenger 
told them about Rodia's work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never heard of the Watts Towers," said Farrah, a service manager. "I'd 
seen a picture of them, but I thought they were for electric lines or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we stopped. This is an interesting part of L.A."

PARTNERS OF GAYS TO RECEIVE CITY MEDICAL BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Beach on Tuesday became the first city in Orange County and one of only 
a handful in the nation to grant medical benefits to unmarried partners of city 
employees, including gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, approved unanimously by the City Council, unmarried 
couples will be eligible for medical and dental coverage already extended to 
spouses of city employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We know today in Southern California and the nation that the American family 
is changing and the city of Laguna Beach is responding to that change," said 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who proposed the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry, who is gay, said the new policy attempts to treat all city employees 
more fairly: "I'm a city employee and I know that I'm treated differently than 
other employees," he said. "It's an issue of basic equity in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
Local gay rights advocates praised the city's action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good news," said Anaheim attorney and gay rights advocate John Doran. "We 
believe both local and state governments have to realize that family units 
include lesbian and gay couples, unmarried heterosexual couples, single parents 
with children . . . these policies have to reflect the family unit as it is 
really structured in America." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach joins three other California cities -- Berkeley, West Hollywood 
and Santa Cruz -- and the city of Seattle in adopting so-called domestic 
partner laws that extend medical or other benefits to unmarried couples. Los 
Angeles recently extended its employee leave program to include domestic 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
To become eligible under the new policy, a couple will have to sign an 
affidavit stating they have lived together for at least six months, intend to 
live together indefinitely, are not related by blood, are mentally competent 
and will notify the city if circumstances of the relationship change. 
</P>
<P>
A Time magazine-Cable News Network poll conducted last November found that 54% 
of Americans thought that homosexual couples should be permitted to receive 
medical benefits from a partner's policy. 
</P>
<P>
But the concept of granting unmarried couples spousal benefits remains 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco voters, for example, defeated a measure that would have required 
employers to recognize unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
Congressman William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and other conservative leaders 
called Laguna Beach's action an attack on marriage and the traditional family. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional family in American society is one man and one woman in an 
institution called marriage, that is the basis of civilization," Dannemeyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Policies similar to the one adopted in Laguna Beach form "one of the 
battlegrounds in the cultural war going on in the 1990s," he added. "The 
council in Laguna Beach has said to God, 'step aside, we have other plans for 
people in this community.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis Sheldon, who heads the Orange County-based Traditional Values 
Coalition, said he had received "a lot of phone calls," from Laguna Beach 
residents angered by the council's action but declined to say whether he will 
mount a challenge to the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment on that," Sheldon said. "But I believe it will go down to 
defeat one way or another. It is truly a biased-related policy to advocate and 
promote the (homosexual) lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they had no estimate of how many of the city's 220 
employees would take advantage of the new policy. Nor were any cost estimates 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel director Philip Hoffman said the city contributes $173 dollars per 
employee per month under the city's health plan. Gentry said other cities that 
have extended their insurance policies have not experienced a significant 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry also said the city had not evaluated what impact the policy might have 
in treating patients who contract the HIV or AIDS virus in the city, or whether 
extension of medical benefits to gay partners might result in higher medical 
costs for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this policy will have an effect on the delivery of health care 
to AIDS patients," Gentry said. "In some ways this could save the city money. 
If two employees in a domestic relationship would now be covered as a family, 
it would be less costly."

ABUSED TEENS SHELTER HAS WOLF AT THE DOOR;

CHILD WELFARE: COUNTY FUNDING FOR CASA YOUTH SHELTER AND OTHER FACILITIES FOR 
ABUSED OR RUNAWAY CHILDREN WILL BE CUT OFF.

She is part runaway and part throwaway, and she needs a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
But she is having trouble explaining to a counselor at the Casa Youth Shelter 
exactly why she feels she can't go home. There are so many reasons. One of them 
is her brother, who recently beat her with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no lock on my bedroom door," said the girl, who during the course of 
Wednesday's intake interview also mentioned that her drunken father once threw 
her out of a two-story window and that she first tried to commit suicide at age 
10. Now she is almost 17, with long, blond hair, a plump, childish face and 
puffy eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked them to put a lock on the door and they don't. So I sit in front of 
the door to keep him out. And that's when he stuck the knife under the door. . 
. . There's holes in my door. There's stab marks on my door and holes where he 
punched it." 
</P>
<P>
In the next room, Casa Youth Shelter board members had called an emergency 
meeting Wednesday, one day after the Board of Supervisors announced that all 
county funding for Casa -- and the four other Orange County shelters for 
runaway and abused teen-agers -- will be cut off in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes as a result of sweeping state budget cuts, which have left 
Orange County $2.5 million short for youth programs this fiscal year. Together, 
the four shelters and a job placement program for ex-convicts, which served 
1,400 youngsters last year, will lose more than $660,000, or up to half of 
their annual operating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The Emancipation Training Center in Anaheim, which runs a long-term program for 
troubled teen-agers, depends entirely on the county money and is expected to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Casa's founder, Myldred Jones, joined other youth advocates Wednesday in 
calling the cuts shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things that we spend money on that don't get directly to 
people, and these kids are literally our future," Jones said. "If we don't 
spend money helping them now, in future years we'll be keeping them in prison 
-- which costs so much more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If the shelters are closed, who's going to take care of these kids?" 
</P>
<P>
Casa's 12 beds are nearly always full, and their occupants need oceans of 
attention. In recent months, shelter workers said, the clientele has included a 
12-year-old male prostitute who was dropped off at the shelter by his 
customer's limousine, a girl whose father ate her pet rabbit "to teach her a 
lesson" and a boy who showed up with two large bruises and a nasty bite, all of 
which he said were inflicted by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Three teen-agers left on Wednesday, headed back to their own homes, to 
Orangewood Children's Home in Orange or to foster homes. But three others were 
waiting to enter, including the girl with the abusive brother. Group counselor 
Phyliss Phillips, an 11-year veteran, took a family history and gently told the 
girl that the shelter would be required to file a report of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Even more gently, Phillips asked her why her parents do not step in to protect 
her. "They're there when you do something wrong," the girl said. "Otherwise, 
it's, 'Leave me alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I'm going to put down that your mother is neglectful," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
About 425 such troubled teens pass through Casa each year. Jones said she is 
determined not to cut the program, although the county funds had made up 40% of 
the shelter's $389,000 annual operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Jones said, board members will devote themselves to raising the 
necessary money at a fund-raising dinner and auction already scheduled for Oct. 
13 at the Spruce Goose in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
If that fails, the only alternative would be to thrust the teen-agers into the 
overcrowded Orangewood Children's Home for abused and neglected children, or 
into a foster care system that does not have enough foster parent volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"With foster homes, they want the little kids, the cute ones," Jones said. 
"They don't want teen-agers. Teen-agers are difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the teen-agers interviewed Wednesday afternoon acknowledged that 
they can indeed be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I was addicted to crystal (methamphetamine)," said one 15-year-old girl with a 
heavy-metal T-shirt and a disconcerting habit of turning the tables on the 
adults around her by grilling them about their behavior. "Other stuff too, but 
mostly crystal. I thought everything was fine, but I didn't see that I lied all 
the time. I couldn't live up to what they wanted me to be, to get a real good 
job, to do real good in school, never lie, respect them, all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, to many of them, it is the adults in their lives who seem difficult and 
incomprehensible. The 15-year-old with the drug problem, for example, later 
revealed that as a child, her grandfather had punished her by hanging her 
upside down and beating her with a belt. 
</P>
<P>
"I got mad, but I didn't hit back," she said. "I never hit back and I didn't 
cry. After a while I didn't feel it any more." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips estimates that 80% of the children who pass through the shelter have 
been physically or sexually abused or have parents who abuse drugs or alcohol. 
As a crisis center, Casa is supposed to keep teen-agers for only 10 days, until 
they can be safely reunited with their families or moved into other programs. 
In fact, however, some teen-agers stay much longer, simply because there is no 
place else for them. 
</P>
<P>
While in the shelter, they take part in group therapy twice a day and have 
individual counseling several times a week, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week an art therapist comes in, and the center's recreation room is 
filled with drawings, paintings and collages made by the children, who range in 
age from 12 to 17. In one exercise, the youths take turns adding features to 
strange-looking animals; then each one offers an explanation of the what the 
animal is feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in a sad place," reads one such drawing. "Everyone there has terrible 
lives. I wish I had a better life." 
</P>
<P>
One 14-year-old, who asked to be called Gina, showed a mobile she made of her 
family. The natural father who she says doesn't want her is shown as a king 
holding his hands over his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Gina spent time in Orangewood two years ago after she confided in a teacher 
that her stepfather had molested her. She said it was a relief to be there, but 
she disliked the regimentation. She has been in and out of Casa four times 
since June and says the shelter is helping her. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids need to have a place to go," she said. "I'd probably kill myself if I was 
still living at home."

CAMPAIGN TARGETS GUN SAFETY FOR YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an alarming increase in the number of children and teen-agers across the 
country being killed or wounded, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and a 
national crime prevention group on Wednesday encouraged handgun safety and 
announced a series of nationwide television public service messages in an 
effort to curb the growing violence. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief also said that some parents should be criminally prosecuted if 
they do not keep their guns out of the reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
He chastised the National Rifle Assn. for opposing restrictions on the purchase 
of semiautomatic assault rifles. "That's just b.s. they tried to present to the 
American public," the chief said, adding that the assault rifle is another 
weapon designed to kill people. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that the number of children killed by guns has increased 97% 
nationwide since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The chief, however, stopped short of calling for stricter gun controls. Noting 
that he has been a lifetime gun owner and has raised children of his own, he 
urged more gun safety and training programs to educate adults on how to protect 
their children from harming themselves with firearms. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that new gun purchasers be required to attend firearm safety 
and training classes, much as teen-agers do to obtain driving licenses. "I am 
for any kind of education in buying a gun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guns are the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for children 14 and 
younger, according to figures released Wednesday by the Los Angeles Police 
Department and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a nonprofit research 
organization in Washington formed to educate the public about the risks and 
responsibilities of handgun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The National School Safety Center estimated that 400,000 boys carried guns to 
school in 1987, and the National Center for Justice Statistics said tens of 
thousands of youngsters are assaulted every year by youths with guns. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, police said, 471 of the 874 homicide victims last year were 
killed by handguns. Ninety-nine of the victims were under 17 years old; 20 were 
under 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department said it seized about 10,500 firearms last year, 75% of 
them handguns. 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize the statistics, Gates described the "very tragic" incident on 
Tuesday when a 4-year-old boy shot and killed himself while playing with a 
loaded pistol in his Los Angeles home, despite his mother's efforts to coax the 
weapon away from the child. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of accident happens over and over and over again, not only in this 
city but across the country," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30-second television spots, which will begin airing here and across the 
nation in the coming weeks, Gates is seen in his uniform, warning about the 
danger of guns, particularly when they fall into the hands of teen-agers and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In one segment, the chief waves a police report describing a child shot 
accidentally by a playmate. In another, he tells the story of two school 
friends who play basketball together and carry handguns in their gym bags; one 
ends up dead, the other in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Horan, an LAPD firearms instructor, said gun safety is one of the first 
lessons taught to police recruits, and some recruits learn to use cables and 
padlocks to secure their weapons from misfiring at home. He said many officers 
and gun owners store their weapons in lockboxes that fit underneath their beds, 
where they are secure but handy if needed. 
</P>
<P>
"That way you can simply reach under the bed," he said, "pull out the drawer, 
unlock the box, and you have your weapon." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Leroy Pyle, an NRA national board member and San Jose 
police officer, defended the gun owners' lobby in its efforts against bans on 
assault rifles. He also said that the NRA works harder than any other 
organization in the country on gun safety, and that the association has 
enlisted 25,000 instructors who teach safety to 800,000 people each year.

SALES TAX HIKE OKD FOR NOVEMBER VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: NEW JOINT GOVERNMENT BOARD APPROVES THE BALLOT MEASURE. IT WOULD ADD 
HALF A CENT TO HELP FUND THE COUNTY'S RAIL SYSTEM AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A sales tax increase measure to generate $400 million per year to help keep Los 
Angeles County's proposed 150-mile rail system and other transit programs on 
track was placed on the November ballot Wednesday by local elected officials 
gathered at a historic transportation session. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the measure would raise the current 6 1/2% sales tax to 7%. 
Consumers would pay more than $400 million annually in added taxes to build and 
operate the new rail system, maintain bus service and make street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who is pushing the measure, said it will ensure that the 
money-short, $5-billion rail construction program will reach the suburban 
neighborhoods of Pasadena, the San Fernando Valley and the South Bay. "There is 
not enough money. This is the only way we can build" the entire system, Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The action came at a meeting in which Bradley, the five county supervisors and 
other elected officials sat for the first time as the joint governing board of 
two large, often warring transportation agencies -- the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The session, required by a new state law, was the first step toward ending the 
running bureaucratic turf battles between the agencies that critics charge have 
hurt the region's ability to deal with growing traffic congestion problems. The 
state law, authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) requires the 
prominent political leaders to meet four times a year as a joint transportation 
board and move gradually toward consolidating the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting opened, Katz urged the officials to "put the finger-pointing and 
sparring behind us and provide Los Angeles with a 21st-Century transportation 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Before Katz was out the door, however, the old rivalry erupted in full flower. 
The two sides squabbled over misdirected agendas and procedures for conducting 
the meetings. Then Supervisor Michael Antonovich, an RTD critic, unsuccessfully 
tried to oust RTD General Manager Alan Pegg and put Transportation Commission 
chief Neil Peterson in charge of both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't control the personalities," groaned Katz as he departed. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax increase measure would be in addition to the more than $400 
million in sales taxes already paid by county consumers under a half-cent levy 
for transit approved in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The tax hike reflects the growing costs of both building and operating the 
county's new rail system, the first leg of which opened last month between Long 
Beach and Los Angeles. The construction program currently is $300 million short 
of its needs for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the current $24 million annual operating cost of the new Long Beach 
Blue Line is being funded temporarily from construction accounts, 
transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax measure squeaked onto the ballot by a 6-5 vote. The leading 
opponent of the measure, Supervisor Pete Schabarum, provided the swing vote. 
Schabarum, who will author the argument against the measure, said he hopes the 
transit tax fails and helps drag down several other proposed tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
"(I'm) trying to present a menu of tax increases so substantial that they are 
rejected in their entirety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the transit tax, county voters in November will be faced with another 
sales tax increase for jail construction, a state sales tax increase for 
anti-crime programs and a county property tax increase to fund new recreation 
and cultural facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The transit measure and the county-sponsored jail construction measure will be 
competing for the last half-cent of local sales tax permitted under current 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the commission agreed to seek new state legislation that would 
allow the jail and transit systems to split the sales tax revenue if both are 
approved.

ORANGE, FULLERTON SET FIREWORKS VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in the cities of Orange and Fullerton will decide in November whether to 
prohibit "safe and sane" fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Councils in both cities this week voted to put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Orange council passed an interim ordinance banning some fireworks, 
including "Piccolo" or "Whistling Petes" and sparklers, deemed most dangerous 
by the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Fire Department report, firefighters found no illegal 
fireworks for sale during this year's Fourth of July holiday period but 
confiscated several boxes of the banned items from Orange residents. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks are illegal in all of the county's unincorporated areas; only six of 
the county's 29 cities allow the sale and use of fireworks.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AGENCY OKS CALABASAS APPLICATION FOR 
CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calabasas inched closer to independence Wednesday when the Local Agency 
Formation Commission approved an application for cityhood by the affluent 
suburb at the western end of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But activists who have worked nearly a decade to incorporate their community 
reacted with restraint, noting they have failed twice in the past and still 
require approval from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and local 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hill, president of the Calabasas Cityhood Committee, noted that LAFCO, 
which oversees the creation of new cities, includes two county supervisors -- 
Ed Edelman and Deane Dana -- who joined in the unanimous vote for cityhood. The 
supervisor representing Calabasas, Michael Antonovich, also supports the 
cityhood drive, apparently guaranteeing three affirmative votes on the 
five-member county board, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REVIVAL OF CITIZEN PANEL ON REDEVELOPMENT 
SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of Hollywood property owners, claiming to have evidence damaging 
to the Community Redevelopment Agency, has gone to court to reinstate the 
Project Area Committee, the one-time official citizens advisory panel on 
Hollywood redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Endangered Property Owners, an informal coalition of several dozen 
landowners, filed a motion Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking a new 
trial in a 15-month-old dispute over the status of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee had become the primary mouthpiece for critics of the 1,100-acre 
renewal effort when the Los Angeles City Council voted last year to disband it. 
A Superior Court judge upheld the council's action, but many committee members 
have continued to meet. Members of the property owners group said they have 
documents showing that the drafters of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan 
intended for the committee to remain in existence for the life of the 30-year 
project. A hearing is set for Aug. 31.

DANGER TO CHILDREN IN TRUCK BEDS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dogs that ride in the back of pickup trucks receive more stringent protection 
under California law than children who ride in the back of trucks, a UC Irvine 
associate professor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting a child in the back of a pickup truck is like putting a child in the 
middle of a busy street, because the chances of a child being ejected and 
ending up in the street are very great," said Phyllis F. Agran, an associate 
professor of pediatrics whose research was published in the prestigious Journal 
of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Agran's article, "Pediatric Injuries in the Back of Pickup Trucks," studied 
accidents involving 290 Orange County children, ranging from infants to 
14-year-olds, who were ejected from the back of pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The study, whose authors include UCI researchers Diane G. Winn and Dawn N. 
Castillo, concluded that children who rode in the back of trucks sustained more 
severe injuries and were more frequently injured and ejected than those who 
rode in the cab -- even in the absence of a collision. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, 9% of 201 children who rode in the cab were ejected even when the 
truck was not involved in a collision, but 24% of 89 children who rode in the 
truck bed were ejected even when there was no collision, Agran's study showed. 
</P>
<P>
"Any kind of turn, swerve, sudden stop can result in a child being ejected," 
she said." 
</P>
<P>
Agran noted that under California law, dogs must be leashed or otherwise 
restrained when riding in the back of a truck. Also, she pointed out, children 
under the age of 12 cannot travel in a truck bed unless they are restrained or 
in an enclosed space. 
</P>
<P>
"But all that is null and void if a parent is traveling in the back with the 
child," Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs, however, must be restrained, even in the presence of an adult, so the law 
is more stringent for dogs, she said. LANIE JONES

<P>
ENCROACHMENTS ON BEACH TO BE AIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue of private encroachments into public, beachfront property is 
scheduled for review by the Planning Commission once again tonight. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are two heavily debated proposals by the city: charging fees from 
property owners who have built onto the beach area and extending the existing 
oceanfront walkway as far as the Santa Ana River jetty. 
</P>
<P>
The boardwalk currently runs from E Street to 36th Street. 
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 295 encroachments on the beach between the Santa Ana 
River entrance and the point of the Balboa Peninsula, where property owners 
have gradually extended up to 27 feet into the sand with small walls, 
landscaping, decks and patios. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to regulate the extensions, a special advisory committee to the 
City Council has recommended that permits be issued for beach walls that reach 
up to 15 feet onto public property. The permits would have fees attached 
ranging from $50 to $200 a year, and any encroachments more than 15 feet would 
not be permitted.

COUNCIL OKS RISE IN CONSTRUCTION FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of two of its most fiscally conservative members, the City 
Council this week voted to increase an assortment of building and planning 
processing fees and establish nine new charges. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted 3 to 2 in favor of the new charges, which will take 
effect next month as an interim step toward reshaping a city fee schedule that 
officials say is outdated. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant change in the new fee schedule, which affects minor home 
renovations as well as the construction of housing tracts, is an added planning 
processing fee for any new construction or renovation. The new fee will tack on 
a charge equivalent to 0.3% of the assessed value of the new project or 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the new charge would mean that the cost of adding a 
400-square-foot room to a house will increase 21%, from $337 to $409, according 
to a Planning Department analysis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cost of 51 service fees, ranging from obtaining a home 
occupation permit to processing an environmental-impact report, will increase 
between 9% and 328%. Eight other new fees have also been created, such as a $35 
charge for each time a city staff member has to reinspect a construction 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The council, at the prodding of City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga, plans 
this fall to hire a consultant to analyze the city's entire fee structure and 
bring its charges in line with what it costs to provide particular services. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Wes Bannister and Jim Silva, who opposed the increases, argued that 
the council should wait for that study to be completed before changing city 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Thomas J. Mays and council members John Erskine and Grace H. Winchell 
prevailed, agreeing with Uberuaga's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Uberuaga, who took over as the city's chief executive in February, warned the 
council that the city could face a budget deficit of $7 million or more if it 
does not inflate the city's annual income. 
</P>
<P>
According to community development director Michael Adams, the city's current 
fees, many of which hadn't been updated since 1981, are among the lowest of 
Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
Including the increases and new fees, which are estimated to bring the city an 
extra $600,000 per year, the city's charges will remain below the county 
average, Adams said.JOHN PENNER

COMMUNITY CENTER FLOOR PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed floor plan for a community center at the corner of Imperial Highway 
and Casa Loma Avenue was approved unanimously Tuesday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for the 26,000-square-foot building includes a room for the Yorba 
Linda Women's Club, a 6,000-square-foot senior citizens' area, an assembly room 
with a stage, a multipurpose room and two other activity areas intended for 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful, beautiful plan," said council member Roland E. Bigonger. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rudometkin, director of parks and recreation for the city, said 
construction of the center is expected to begin in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the community center had been delayed because the city's first 
intended location, on grounds owned by the Placentia Unified School District, 
met with opposition by district representatives who wanted schools to receive a 
higher priority than other groups for use of the center. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the new site April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Rudometkin said the matter now will be referred to the Planning Commission for 
hearings.

VILLA SANTIAGO PLAN IS FINALLY DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than four years of battling a proposal to develop the former 
Santiago Golf Course, residents won a resounding victory this week when the 
City Council unanimously rejected a plan to build a housing tract on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of the Burnett-Ehline Development Co. project marks the third time 
in less than a decade that residents have successfully stopped development of 
the 37 acres along Santiago Creek, the last large tract of open space in 
central Orange. 
</P>
<P>
This time, a coalition of organizations hopes to raise funds that will allow 
them to purchase the land and preserve it as a park. 
</P>
<P>
"The system works," said Ralph Masek, president of the Santiago Creek 
Homeowners Assn. and one of the leaders of the movement to "Save Santiago 
Creek." 
</P>
<P>
"People have told me, 'Ralph, you can't fight City Hall.' But the voters can 
and citizens can, if they want to," he said. "City Hall is there for the 
citizens, not for the developers." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of more than 300 people who packed City Council chambers for the public 
hearing Tuesday cheered when the council voted 4 to 0 to deny the project, a 
decision that followed months of public protest and lobbying on the issue. 
Mayor Don E. Smith was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have long opposed the project, Villa Santiago, because it would 
rezone the area to allow denser development and would fill in the creek bed, 
eliminating what has been called an important flood wash. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which would have consisted of 160 single-family residences along 
Santiago Creek between Cambridge Street and Tustin Avenue and a seven-acre 
commercial plaza, began as a 471-unit apartment complex. After several 
revisions, the plan was given preliminary approval in February. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William G. Steiner, who had voted to approve the project in 
February, said he changed his vote because he saw a deadlock between the 
developer and the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there was any further opportunity for negotiation or 
compromise, given the (public's) intensity of feeling on the issue," Steiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some supporters of the Burnett-Ehline plan said they backed the project because 
they did not believe the council would allow the land to remain as a greenbelt 
and they felt Villa Santiago was the best alternative offered the city, 
resident Joan North said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she added, there is no one to take responsibility for removing 22 
abandoned homes on Rosewood Avenue, which was among improvements promised in 
the Burnett-Ehline plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to take care of the flood canal? Who's going to demolish those 
abandoned homes? Who's going to do it?" North asked. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Burnett-Ehline has announced no future plans for the property, but 
supporters of Save Santiago Creek hope that someday they will be able to 
purchase the land and turn it into a "passive park." 
</P>
<P>
Howard DeCruyenaere, president of the Santiago Creek Greenway Alliance, said 
funds to purchase the property could be raised through grants, bonds and 
private fund-raising. However, DeCruyenaere said that some state grants require 
cooperation from the city and he felt that it was unclear whether the city 
would participate in a partnership to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
DeCruyenaere said he hopes this week's victory will spark a movement to create 
a greenway along Santiago Creek stretching from Irvine Lake to the Santa Ana 
River. MARY HELEN BERG

PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATED FOR ALLEGEDLY DESTROYING EVIDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: SHE REPORTEDLY DESTROYED A PHOTOGRAPH FOUND IN JACKET OF MAN ACQUITTED 
OF MURDER CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran prosecutor in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office is 
being investigated for allegedly destroying evidence in a murder trial -- a 
recent case in which an old burrito helped to acquit the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christine Gosney, during jury deliberations last month in 
the murder trial of Edward Vasquez, told a judge she had destroyed a photograph 
of a little boy found in Vasquez's jacket because it might have created 
sympathy for the defendant, Vasquez's defense attorney, Jay Jaffe, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gosney's revelation July 27 came as Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg was 
considering whether to reopen the argument portion of the trial because of 
something else found in Vasquez's jacket: a 2-year-old burrito. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe had argued that the burrito, discovered in a pocket only after the jury 
had adjourned to deliberate their verdict, substantiated part of Vasquez's 
alibi. The green jacket had been seized as evidence when Vasquez was arrested 
in 1988 on charges of shooting a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing about the burrito, Weisberg did reopen the trial, the burrito was 
entered into evidence and, ultimately, Vasquez was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
But Gosney's admission in court that she had destroyed the photograph, which 
was inscribed with the words "To my uncle Eddie," led the district attorney's 
office to open an investigation, according to Jaffe. The defense lawyer said an 
investigator from the district attorney's office interviewed him earlier this 
month as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe said Gosney told the judge the photo fell out of a pocket when she 
examined the jacket before the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was an important piece of evidence," Jaffe said. "(Whether) the 
prosecutor felt the piece of evidence had a sympathetic effect in favor of the 
defense, that's an issue the judge has to decide rather than her." 
</P>
<P>
Gosney has also reportedly been suspended pending outcome of the investigation. 
She could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a personnel matter (and) I can't comment," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, 23, had been accused of killing a security guard in September, 1988. 
The prosecution had argued that Vasquez, wearing a white T-shirt, shot the 
guard in a Central Los Angeles parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
But Vasquez, a student at Cal State Los Angeles, had maintained that he was 
wearing the jacket and standing some distance from the shooting -- buying a 
burrito.

DIGNITARY'S SHOPLIFTING CASE DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Despite objections by the prosecutors, a Municipal Court judge Wednesday 
dismissed a grand theft charge against a former Japanese dignitary whose 
shoplifting case was initially dropped after Mayor Tom Bradley contacted police 
at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald Schoenberg granted a request for a "civil compromise" by defense 
attorneys representing Yukio Umemura, 59, and ordered him to pay $300 in court 
costs. Lawyers for Umemura, who resigned in disgrace as chairman of the Nagoya 
City Assembly after the April 14 incident, told Schoenberg that an agreement 
had been worked out between Umemura and the airport vendor, Duty Free Shoppers 
Ltd., not to prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
Umemura, who did not qualify for diplomatic immunity as a Japanese city 
official, was detained by airport police after he allegedly took two Gucci 
wallets and a brown leather purse valued at $450 from the duty-free shop at the 
airport. Within hours of the arrest, the case was dropped after a phone call by 
Bradley to police and a meeting between a top Bradley aide, Umemura, two police 
sergeants and Duty Free officials. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn said Wednesday that his office wanted to prosecute 
Umemura on a misdemeanor count that would have carried a maximum penalty of one 
year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"The public interest is not vindicated by civil compromises in shoplifting 
cases because shoplifting burdens all consumers who have to ultimately pay the 
bill for losses caused to businesses by shoplifters," Hahn said. "And in this 
case, where the property was recovered, the damage clearly was not to the 
victim, Duty Free Shoppers, but to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Umemura did not appear in court Wednesday. He had planned to fly to Los Angeles 
if the judge had ordered a trial, said his attorney, Jeanne Rowzee. 
</P>
<P>
Umemura's relationship with Bradley was the prime motivation behind the city 
attorney's decision to file the theft charge, Rowzee said. "We think the case 
took on a life of its own," she said. "I've never seen so much ado about an 
alleged misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
And, according to a court declaration filed in July by a lawyer for Duty Free, 
the firm did not want to pursue the theft case against Umemura. 
</P>
<P>
But Duty Free officials should have had no say in deciding whether to prosecute 
Umemura, said Deputy City Atty. Asha Saund, who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the first time we have prosecuted a case with unwilling victims," 
Saund said. Duty Free officials had initially wanted to press charges against 
Umemura, according to police reports, but changed their minds after conferring 
with Jeffrey Matsui, a top aide to the mayor who arrived at the airport to 
assist Umemura. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui and Bradley have refused to discuss their involvement in the case. A 
spokesman for the mayor has said that Bradley did not seek to influence the 
case in any way.

ANN CONWAY: RAMS, FRONTIERE IN BERLIN FOR KICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a moonlight dinner cruise Wednesday night on the Havel River for Georgia 
Frontiere and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Los Angeles Rams, visiting Germany's largest city for 
Saturday's exhibition game between the Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs, tossed 
a three-hour bash aboard the Havel Queen paddleboat to celebrate what she hoped 
would be the Rams' third American Bowl win. 
</P>
<P>
"Although," Frontiere admitted, "I don't predict; I just pray." Gathered around 
the only woman to own a professional football team were about 400 guests, 
including Rams' team members and their wives, as well as Orange County VIPs 
such as Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Fleetwood Enterprises Chairman John Crean, 
Mary and James Roosevelt, and Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 p.m., guests boarded the double-decker buses that would whisk them to 
Berlin's fairy-tale-like Grunewald Forest area, a place where princes hunted 
boar and deer in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Boarding the triple-decker vessel to romantic accordion music, guests queued up 
to bars where mugs of beer, red and white wines, and Jack Daniels with 
Coca-Cola were served. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to arrive was Rams quarterback Jim Everett, escorting his 
longtime girlfriend, Kristina Beatty. Everett admitted that he hadn't exactly 
been in strict training for Saturday's game at Olympic Stadium. "I've been out 
every night," he said. "I think I've seen it all. Berlin is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Frontiere, her blond hair flowing over a floral blue chiffon cocktail dress, 
seemed relieved that the Rams had finally pulled off a game in Berlin. (The 
previous American Bowl games took place in Tokyo and London). 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful that we're here," she said, arm in arm with her beau, Earle 
Weatherwax Jr. "We began three years ago to get the possibility of a game here 
started, but then, people had their doubts. I'm grateful that it all turned 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Rams Coach John Robinson, on board with his wife, Linda, almost seemed blase 
about the upcoming game. "This is a practice game, a rehearsal," Robinson said. 
"I mean, years from now you aren't going to hear people saying, 'Remember when 
the Rams played Berlin?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson did find one cause for excitement: the opportunity to play in 
Olympic Stadium. "Playing there is exciting, even if it isn't an event that 
will go down in history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 people are expected to show up at the stadium, which was built for 
the 1936 Olympic Games. Not exactly standing room only for a facility that can 
easily seat 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Harnisch, a Berliner who was born 11 days before the Berlin Wall was 
erected in 1961, blamed the projected low attendance on ignorance. "I mean, I 
know what a football looks like," he said. "And I know what a quarterback is, 
and a touchdown is. But that's about all I know." And this from the man who has 
been the Rams' liaison with the Berlin Police Department for almost a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is a brand new thing for Germany," Harnisch added. "It's not popular 
here like soccer. People just don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Germany's seeming indifference aside, members of the Rams were excited about 
playing in Olympic Stadium. Duval Love, an offensive guard, said he felt 
honored to be on the same field where Jesse Owens captured four Olympic gold 
medals in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
The same went for offensive tackle Robert Cox. "I feel like I'll be a part of 
history," Cox said. "Owens is a big part of black history; you grow up on that. 
He was one of my most important role models." 
</P>
<P>
As the riverboat cruised the deep green waters of the Havel, a Dixieland jazz 
band entertained. From the top deck, guests could see in the distance the 
little that is left of the all-but-dismantled wall. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler, sporting a Mickey Mouse pin in his lapel, said he was happy to be in 
Berlin, representing a city that has a German history of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," he said, "I'm a little jealous of the fact that Los Angeles has 
Berlin for a sister city. We've tried to get a sister city for Anaheim in 
Germany for years, but we just haven't been able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the city plans to keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
While guests enjoyed the fare served up aboard the Havel Queen, it could hardly 
compete with the sumptuous spread laid out the night before at the Grand Hotel 
in East Berlin, where Frontiere is staying. On Tuesday night, the Rams' owner 
gathered about 40 friends around her -- including Vasquez, the Creans, the 
Roosevelts and a smattering of Los Angeles city councilmen -- to dine on an 
elegant repast in an intimate room with a sweeping view of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a sad sight from those windows," John Crean said. "Right in the 
middle of dinner I saw a woman walk out on her roof to hang up her laundry."

<P>
A 50-year-old woman was reported in good condition after a man stole her car 
Tuesday night and then ran over her twice. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the hospital declined to identify the woman or her 49-year-old 
husband, who was not injured in the incident at Quartz Street and Brooke 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's car was rammed from behind by two men driving a stolen car, said 
Police Lt. Larry Woessner. When the husband got into a fight with the other 
driver, the passenger in the stolen car got out and pointed a gun at the 
husband. Then the first man got into the couple's car and drove away with the 
woman inside. 
</P>
<P>
About two blocks away, the assailant pushed the woman out of the car and ran 
over her twice.

A 14-month-old baby was in critical condition Wednesday after her mother found 
her floating face down in a pool, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Justine Pesicka was taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center, where she was revived 
by doctors and later transferred by helicopter to Long Beach Memorial Hospital 
after the 4:30 p.m. incident, Cypress Police Sgt. Sandy Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the child and her mother, both of Anaheim, were visiting relatives 
when the child apparently wandered away. 
</P>
<P>
Justine "went to the back yard and managed to climb a nearby ladder to an 
above-ground pool," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother told police that the child could have been face down in the water 
for as long as five minutes.

CYCLING: IN THE RACE ACROSS AMERICA, A GOOD SUPPORT CREW IS CRUCIAL TO MAKE IT 
TO THE TOP.

<TEXT>
<P>
Night has fallen in southwestern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:20 p.m. (PDT) Tuesday, Richard Fedrigon, 38, of Chicago, walks out of his 
room at the Country View Lodge ready to begin his third night in the Race 
Across America. 
</P>
<P>
He has slept nearly two hours, all he's going to sleep for the next 24, and now 
it's time to get back on the bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
A crew of four is ready to follow a short distance behind in a 1987 Toyota van. 
When Fedrigon hits the blacktop, the van drops in behind him. It will stay 
there until Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Driving is Bob Lynn, 30, from State College, Pa. The navigator is Ron Kohl, 36, 
of Libertyville, Ill. Cindi Staiger, 38, former RAAM women's division winner 
and the van's owner, is in back. They are part of Fedrigon's seven-person, 
two-vehicle support crew. The fourth rider in the van is aboard to observe and 
learn how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
They will guide Fedrigon through the most difficult and dangerous part of any 
24-hour period in RAAM -- the night hours. And they will do it over the 
steepest climbs along the 2,922-mile route from Irvine to Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon begins Tuesday night's ride with gentle climbs and descents, heading 
east on U.S. route 160. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight miles ahead is Wolf Creek Pass, the highest point on the course. 
The pass is 10,850 feet above sea level, 4,338 feet above Durango. 
</P>
<P>
At first the tasks are simple. But the crew cannot know how difficult things 
will become as the night wears on. 
</P>
<P>
Staiger seems so keyed up she can't sit still. She arranges and rearranges 
various plastic tubs. Some are filled with shorts and arm and leg warmers and 
others with tires. Others contain food -- wheat crackers, grapes, bananas. A 
cardboard box is filled to overflowing with plastic water bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Staiger, who joined the crew Saturday afternoon, sits on an ice chest stocked 
with soda, baked potatoes, water and a high-calorie, high-carbohydrate drink 
called Ultra Energy. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon will drink a bottle once every 40 to 50 minutes as the road rises and 
falls toward the base of Wolf Creek. 
</P>
<P>
He is working hard now. He was the race's leader for Tuesday afternoon's trek 
across southern Utah and into Colorado. While he slept, however, first Bob 
Fourney of Denver, at home in the thin air, then Rob Kish of Port Orange, Fla., 
and Al Muldoon of St. Joseph, Mich., passed him. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:58, Fedrigon, with the crew in tow, passes a support van with Kish's race 
number, 39, affixed to it. Kish's bike, Staiger reports, is resting on the 
front end. Kish must be sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
"That's got him so excited," Kohl says as Fedrigon picks up his pace. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon stops momentarily at 9:30 to put on arm and leg warmers and an extra 
jacket. Already, it's getting colder, perhaps below 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Some riders prefer to have music played to them over the pace van's 
public-address system. Rick Kent of Houston is called the Boom Box Kid because 
of the huge stereo speakers installed on the roof of his van. 
</P>
<P>
Some like to be read to. On a long grade 20 miles west of Durango, Kish's crew 
read the Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon likes the relative solitude. After all, the van is only a couple of 
yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing into Pagosa Springs, Colo., the last town before the climb, the crew 
sees the amber flashers of a rider. By 11:35, they've caught Muldoon. Only 
Fourney is ahead now. But so is Wolf Creek Pass. 
</P>
<P>
The road is steeper now. Fewer cars pass and the crew pulls alongside Fedrigon 
to hand him Ultra Energy in a fixed pattern. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 a.m., the van's radio picks up the old Blood, Sweat and Tears 
standard, "Spinnin' Wheel." In a minute, it fades out, to be replaced by Roy 
Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Both songs seem appropriate at this hour on this 
stretch of road. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon passes a road sign that reads: 8 Miles to Wolf Creek Summit. 
</P>
<P>
It's 1:06 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon rounds the hairpin curves strongly for the first two miles. At one 
point, Staiger and the observer hop out of the van to hand him more Ultra 
Energy, running alongside. The thin air leaves them gasping for breath when 
they flop back in the van. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally focused," Fedrigon tells them before they leave. "I'm very 
introspective right now. I'm dealing with the discomfort. Actually, it's not 
too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Trouble begins less than 20 minutes later, he's off his bike, walking it then 
running it. A pattern begins. Fedrigon rides a while, walks a while, his 
confidence is seeping away in the cold and the altitude. 
</P>
<P>
The crew changes rear wheels in effort to gain a lower gear. It seems to help 
only for a few hundred meters. It's getting colder and a wind has begun. 
</P>
<P>
After yet another stop, this time to woof down a baked potato and drink more 
Ultra Energy, Fedrigon sighs, "Another round with Mike Tyson." 
</P>
<P>
At 2:15, he's shivering uncontrollably. The temperature seems to have dipped 
below 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The crew changes Fedrigon's clothes. He sits in the back of the van while the 
crew adds wool tights, another jacket and a windbreaker over that, one cap 
under his helmet and another over it. At 2:33, he's riding again, this time 
with Staiger running alongside as escort. 
</P>
<P>
That works for a while, but the stops become painful to watch. Fedrigon's 
confidence is ruined. He's angry with himself. Nothing the crew can do or say 
seems to help. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to get through this himself," Staiger says after one stop. 
</P>
<P>
Even fresh, in daylight hours, this would be a brutal grind to the top. At this 
hour, with the temperature dropping with every twist up the mountainside, the 
summit seems unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:58, John Marino, RAAM's founder and race director, pulls up in the 
officials' van. After a few words of encouragement, Marino pulls away. 
</P>
<P>
More stops, more words of encouragement from the crew. More stops, more Ultra 
Energy. The end still is nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Fedrigon's second support van pulls up. The day crew, having slept 
four hours back in Durango, is aboard, waiting to scout the route ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, as the sky in the east begins to lighten, Fedrigon passes under 
a large yellow sign announcing the summit. It's 3:42 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It took Fedrigon 2 hours 36 minutes to cover the eight-mile climb. One wonders 
what affect the mountain will have on riders of lesser ability, now as far as a 
day's ride behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:10, Fedrigon reaches the bottom of the steep, eight-mile descent. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the driver's wheel, Lynn says, "Where was all that energy a half an hour 
ago?" 
</P>
<P>
By 4:30, Fedrigon is cold again. The winds have lashed at him during the trip 
down the mountain. While he guzzles hot soup, the crew makes a shift change. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Taterai from Sydney, Australia, slips behind the wheel. Lynn moves into 
the navigator's seat. Kohl, who has slept only one hour in the past 24, heads 
for the second van and a nap. Jeff Cope from St. Louis hops in back, replacing 
Staiger. 
</P>
<P>
The new crew's task is to lift Fedrigon's spirits as he rides through a level 
stretch, but still more than 7,500 feet above sea level. They discuss the best 
way to do this. The van pulls alongside. 
</P>
<P>
Fedrigon wants to sleep. The crew wants him stay on the bike. The sun, now 
rising over the mountains, will warm him and he'll begin to find his confidence 
again, they figure. 
</P>
<P>
After a pit stop at a gas station, the crew changes Fedrigon's clothes. They 
receive word that Fourney is only 20 minutes ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the news, Fedrigon charges across the flat countryside. By day's end, 
he'll make two more climbs of more than 9,000 feet, but the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the seemingly endless road to the Wolf Creek Summit, Fedrigon had said, 
"I just want to get through Colorado. I'm actually looking forward to the 
humidity in the south." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the conditions, his crew will be right behind him every pedal of the 
way.

<P>
The possible outbreak of hostilities prompted many American companies to make 
hasty contingency plans for evacuating U.S. employees and dependents from Saudi 
Arabia, and a number of firms began bringing employees' family members back 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed a State Department travel advisory issued late Tuesday 
night, which said the department was allowing dependents of U.S. government 
personnel on a voluntary basis to leave the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia, as 
well as the countries of Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The 
advisory also recommended that private American citizens consider leaving as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Bechtel, an international engineering and construction 
firm, said Wednesday that it was offering flights from the country to employees 
working on non-essential projects and their families. Bechtel declined to 
disclose the number of employees eligible, but about 900 staff and family 
members live and work in Saudi Arabia, a spokesman said. The company will 
continue to staff normal operations in the country, he said. However, most of 
the dozens of companies contacted Wednesday said they didn't have immediate 
plans to bring employees back. Companies said they were monitoring events 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
"Every hour is a different situation," said Herb Ryan, a spokesman for Dresser 
Industries in Dallas, which has employees in Saudi Arabia working in oil and 
gas exploration. "If they start shooting you have a whole different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Corp., which has extensive interests in Saudi Arabia as well as 220 
employees and 144 employees' dependents, said the dependents were being 
evacuated. A Mobil spokesman in New York said they would be brought to Western 
Europe on regularly scheduled flights as well as special charters. However, 
Mobil said that unless the situation deteriorates further employees will 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies that began flying out dependents included Hughes Aircraft Co. 
and the big engineering concern Fluor Corp. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp. of San Francisco said it had advised about 80 dependents of 
employees -- who are on loan to the Saudi oil company, Saudi Aramco -- that 
Chevron is ready to evacuate them. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Silvius, a spokesman for Hughes in Los Angeles, said his company has fewer 
than a dozen employees in Saudi Arabia, who advise the Saudi military. Family 
members were being urged to leave because "what you don't want to do is take 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
A number of companies also said they were leaving it up to employees and family 
members to decide whether to leave Saudi Arabia. Texaco, which has about 50 
employees on loan to Saudi Aramco, said it was helping to make travel 
arrangements for dependents wishing to leave. A Texaco spokesman said that 
although employees weren't being ordered out of the country, "They have been 
told that if they desire, they are free to leave." Dresser, too, said it left 
the decision up to employees. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said Dresser employees had been notified that "if they think their safety 
is at risk they are to exit as fast as they can by the best means they can." 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that airports in Saudi Arabia appeared crowded 
with foreigners attempting to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Many American companies interviewed Wednesday cited concerns for the safety of 
their employees and refused to provide details of the number working in Saudi 
Arabia and neighboring countries or contingency plans to evacuate them. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Co., involved with a consortium of companies in maintaining the Saudi 
"Peace Shield" AWACS early warning aircraft fleet, said employees and family 
members based in Saudi Arabia but who were out of the country were advised not 
to return. However, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle refused to say if an 
evacuation is contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
Other American firms with significant numbers of employees in Saudi Arabia but 
which declined to discuss contingency plans Wednesday included Procter &amp; 
Gamble, General Electric, Westinghouse Electric and Halliburton. 
</P>
<P>
A General Electric spokesman said, "We are working closely with the State 
Department to assure security, but to avoid compromising the safety of our 
employees we are not commenting further." 
</P>
<P>
Guy Marcus, a spokesman for Halliburton, an oil services company based in 
Dallas, stressed that his company isn't contemplating a withdrawal from Saudi 
Arabia. "We're not closing down operations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said the number of U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia is 
about 24,000, not counting military personnel sent in over the past few days. 
Of the 24,000, about 650 are U.S. government personnel and family members. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in Iraq and Kuwait, U.S. companies have heavy investments in Saudi 
Arabia, and assets as well as employees may be threatened if war erupts. Most 
U.S. assets in the country are in the form of joint ventures with Saudi 
partners, in which U.S. companies own 50% or less. A large portion of U.S. 
investment in Saudi Arabia is in processing plants and equipment related to 
petroleum and petrochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil, for example, has a 50% interest in a recently completed refinery, as 
well as a petrochemical plant and a plant that blends motor lubricants. The 
refinery, Yanbu Refinery on the Red Sea, north of Jidda, processes 125,000 
barrels of oil per day. 
</P>
<P>
A Commerce Department spokeswoman said that at the end of 1989, the total value 
of U.S. direct investment in Saudi Arabia was $1.81 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has also been an important destination for U.S. exports. Commerce 
Department figures show that the United States has been Saudi Arabia's biggest 
supplier of imports, with U.S. companies sending considerable quantities of 
agricultural equipment, as well as air conditioning and refrigeration 
machinery.

President Bush, moving to minimize the oil embargo's effect on the U.S. 
economy, on Wednesday urged other industrial nations to join the United States 
in considering tapping their pools of stored oil to help offset the loss of 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices retreated in hectic trading Wednesday on world oil markets, 
no doubt partly because Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and several other members of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared ready to boost oil 
production to replace some of the 4.5 million barrels a day that once flowed 
from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters that he expects some oil producers to raise output levels 
"very, very soon." 
</P>
<P>
The President, in a televised speech Wednesday morning, also called on the 
American public to reduce its energy demand. 
</P>
<P>
"I will explore whether we and our allies should draw down our strategic 
petroleum reserves," Bush said. "Conservation measures can also help. Americans 
everywhere must do their part." 
</P>
<P>
Bush signaled a possible reversal of the Administration's opposition to tapping 
the nation's 590-million-barrel reserve by suggesting that the United States 
will go along if other nations agree to dip into their own storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Oil analysts have been almost unanimous in urging the White House to dip into 
the nation's strategic petroleum reserve -- established in the mid-1970s to 
offset any sudden supply crunch -- to help dampen the recent surge in oil 
prices that threatens to topple the struggling U.S. economy into a full-fledged 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. energy aides had argued that the government's hoards of stored oil should 
be used only to offset a severe shortage rather than just to hold down 
escalating prices. But they hinted Wednesday at a change in policy. 
</P>
<P>
"A multilateral drawdown is much better than a unilateral drawdown," one Energy 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The government-owned reserve, stored in underground Texas and Louisiana salt 
domes, is enough to cover total U.S. imports for 80 days and could offset lost 
Kuwaiti and Iraqi supplies for almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese government stocks include about 200 million barrels, while Western 
European nations hold about 80 million barrels -- also equal to roughly three 
months of oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, representatives of 21 major industrial nations, including U.S. 
energy official John Easton, will meet in Paris at the International Energy 
Agency, the West's energy security operation created after the 1973 Arab oil 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The IEA can ask its member nations to curb demand or draw on stocks. Although 
the group can also impose compulsory oil sharing when any nation suffers a 7% 
oil supply shortage, spokesman Joyce Heard said it is "not expected that the 
IEA will decide to use its emergency oil sharing system at this time." 
</P>
<P>
One proposal that is likely to emerge from the meeting, an IEA official said, 
is to call on countries to encourage industrial and electric power facilities 
to switch from oil to natural gas where possible. 
</P>
<P>
In public, Administration officials continued to play down the chances of 
recession this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The events of the last week, where the price of oil has gone up, is going to 
impose additional hardship on the economy," admitted Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady. But he added: "We are not contemplating a recession." 
</P>
<P>
With the economy likely to be suffering from higher oil prices, White House 
officials have begun to echo those in Congress who are talking about scaling 
back plans to cut the federal deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1. They are worried that large spending cuts and tax increases 
could exacerbate economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that the first-year figure will come out to be exactly $50 
billion," Brady said, but ". . . we cannot be strong, as strong as we should 
be, if we continue with the deficits that the President has spoken so 
forcefully about." 
</P>
<P>
While the White House still will press for an ambitious five-year deficit deal 
with Congress when lawmakers return in September, Administration aides are 
worried that taking a big bite out of the budget next year could be too much 
for the economy to absorb when it is likely to be suffering already from 
spurting oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"If the economy begins to look really bad," said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), 
"every element of the deficit-reduction package will be threatened." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict in the Persian Gulf also limits White House credibility as it has 
threatened to impose $100 billion in automatic spending cuts on Oct. 1 called 
for under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>

THE U.S. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: In 1976, concerned that a cutoff in Middle east oil supplies might 
threaten U.S. national security, Congress created the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, designed to store excess crude oil for use by the armed forces and 
vital industries in case of a shortage. Filling began in 1977 but was halted in 
1979 in exchange for Saudi Arabia's promise to increase production. "Deposits" 
of crude resumed in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
PROCEDURES: Before the reserve can actually be tapped, the President must 
declare a "severe" energy emergency. The oil is sold at auction in a process 
that takes three weeks. Would-be buyers must offer separate bids for each type 
of oil-light, or heavy-crude - and for one of three or four separate delivery 
cycles. The oil than is delivered by one of several pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
CAPACITY: The reserve currently contains 590 million barrels of oil. Its daily 
pumping capacity of 3.5 million barrels is considered adequate to make up the 
most likely shortfall of 1 million to 4 million barrels per day. The United 
States imports a total of 8 million barrels a day, but not all of this would be 
at risk if the Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER COUNTRIES: Three other countries maintain similar strategic reserves. 
Japan, with the largest, has available 170 million barrels of crude. West 
Germany has 54 million and Sweden 25 million. Many other countries require 
their oil companies to maintain excess inventories. 
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS: The reserve is a complex of six huge, water-filled salt domes on 
the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast. The crude oil to be stored is pumped into a 
dome, displacing the water. The salt provides an impermeable layer,. virtually 
like plastic, that can preserve the oil indefinitely. To tap the stored crude, 
the process is reversed: Seawater is pumped in, displacing the oil.

THRIFTY'S PRESIDENT RESIGNS; UP TO 100 STORES TO BE CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thrifty Corp.'s longtime president has resigned, and 50 to 100 of the company's 
ailing drugstores and sporting goods outlets will be closed over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based owner of Thrifty, Pacific Enterprises, also announced 
Wednesday that, as expected, it lost $229 million during its second quarter. 
The loss stemmed largely from a one-time accounting charge of $275 million that 
analysts said will translate into higher earnings for the energy and retailing 
company in future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Departing as president of Thrifty is Richard G. Eils, 52, the company's 
president for 10 years and its chief executive since February. The company said 
Eils, who began his career with Thrifty 25 years ago as an industrial engineer, 
will "pursue other interests." 
</P>
<P>
He was replaced as president by Daniel Seigel, a lawyer who had no retailing 
experience before joining Thrifty in March as executive vice president and 
chief financial officer. Seigel started in Pacific Enterprises' legal 
department in 1974, and worked his way up to president of the company's 
alternative energy and leasing businesses before going to Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
The job of chief executive at Thrifty -- whose seven chains include Thrifty, 
Thrifty Jr. and Big 5 sporting goods -- was left vacant. The company said it is 
conducting a nationwide search for senior executives with retailing experience, 
but that no decision was made on whether it will fill the chief executive's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Seigel, for at least the time being, will be in charge of Thrifty's day-to-day 
operations, and Leonard H. Straus is continuing as the company's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifty's 1,070 drugstores and sporting goods shops account for 29,000 of 
Pacific Enterprises' 40,000 employees and close to half of its revenue, but 
last year brought in only one-fifth of its after-tax operating income. They are 
mainly in California, but also operate in various Western and Midwestern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The stores have been hurt by, among other things, price-slashing by such 
competitors as the Sav-On drugstore chain. Pacific Enterprises said it plans to 
close "marginal" stores among Thrifty's retail chains as part of its effort to 
improve earnings. 
</P>
<P>
No decision was announced on which stores will be closed. As many as 2,000 
employees could be affected by the closings, but the company said efforts will 
be made to minimize dismissals by transferring workers to healthy stores. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Enterprises' second-quarter loss resulted from a $100-million writedown 
of Thrifty's assets and a $175-million writedown of the reserves of its Pacific 
Enterprises Oil unit. Analysts said the charge against the oil and gas business 
was essentially an accounting fluke linked to a temporary decline in energy 
prices. Now that those assets have been written down, however, it will preclude 
energy depletion charges in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock climbed $1.125 
to close at $39.75. Analysts attributed the gain to optimism about the impact 
of the Persian Gulf crisis on Pacific Enterprises' oil and gas business. 
</P>
<P>
They also cited hopes that the company's big utility business, Southern 
California Gas Co., will benefit from a possible decline in interest rates. In 
addition, Pacific Enterprises bolstered the confidence of investors by 
announcing that its cash flow remains strong and can "readily accommodate" the 
company's regular dividend payments. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Enterprises' $229-million quarterly loss came on operating revenue that 
climbed 4% to $1.6 billion. The company earned $53 million in the year-ago 
quarter.

Progress on New Jetliner: McDonnell Douglas has advanced its proposed MD-12X 
jetliner in recent weeks by beginning marketing discussions with airlines, the 
company said. The program, which has been in development since last year, is 
still in its preliminary stages and McDonnell has not been authorized by its 
board to formally offer the aircraft for sale to customers. The MD-12X is based 
on the MD-11 and DC-10 jetliners, but it would be stretched and fitted with a 
new wing, enabling it to carry 80 to 180 more passengers than the 293 now 
carried by the MD-11.

</P>
<P>
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T PLAN TO RATION GASOLINE IF SHORTAGES DEVELOP; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: CONGRESS AGREES THAT THE COMPLEX PRICE AND SUPPLY CONTROLS IMPOSED 
DURING THE 1979 SHORTAGE CAUSED MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY WERE WORTH. 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration has no plans to ration gasoline and other petroleum 
products in the United States even if world oil supplies become scarce because 
of the Middle East crisis, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
There is no law giving the government authority to control gasoline prices and 
supplies. And neither the Administration nor Congress is showing an immediate 
interest in seeking expanded powers. 
</P>
<P>
The complex system of controls used in 1979, when cuts in Iranian oil supplies 
prompted worldwide buying panics and hoarding that sent crude oil prices 
soaring to well over $30 a barrel, has long since been dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
Even the staunchest critics of the oil industry apparently have no appetite for 
rebuilding the cumbersome structure of regulation abolished by the Reagan 
Administration in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned a hard lesson about controls; you only use them in the most 
extreme situation," said Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.), chairman of the energy 
and power subcommittee of the House Energy Committee. "Over time, they generate 
huge problems. You can't allocate oil very well in a dynamic economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp noted that none of his subcommittee members expressed interest in federal 
controls on prices or supplies at a special hearing Tuesday prompted by the 
Middle East crisis. The reaction was the same at a hearing last winter, when 
the economy was hit by huge increases in the price of heating oil and propane. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress who once would have been loud in their insistence on 
rationing and price controls are notably silent, Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, apart from the Administration's decision to consider tapping 
strategic reserves to increase supply, action on prices will be limited to 
President Bush's call for the oil industry to show restraint. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans everywhere must do their part," the President said Wednesday in a 
televised address. "I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share. They 
should show restraint and not abuse today's uncertainties to raise prices." 
</P>
<P>
There is "no authority" for supply allocations or price regulations and "no 
plans" to request action by Congress, said Jeff Sherwood, a spokesman for the 
Energy Department. The Justice Department is looking into possible 
anti-competitive activity, and the Energy Department's role is "to monitor 
prices," Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal price controls and supply regulations were first imposed on the oil 
business in 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon announced a general price 
freeze. The last petroleum regulations were lifted a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
During its 10-year life span, the regulatory system coped with two crises, the 
Arab oil embargo against the United States in 1973 and the supply cut after the 
Iranian revolution in 1979. Both periods were marked by panic buying, with 
anxious consumers lined up at service stations trying to top off their tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Although controls have disappeared, the Energy Department still has an Economic 
Regulatory Administration, which is disposing of the remaining cases filed by 
the government against oil companies for violating the complex pricing 
regulations. The government has collected billions of dollars from oil and gas 
producers, distributing the money to state governments, wholesalers, retailers 
and other consumers who were victims of overcharging. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Lobell, a Washington lawyer who worked as a referee in distributing 
overcharge funds, said the regulatory system was complex and burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with price controls is that they work for a short period of time 
and then get too complicated," Lobell said. "You substitute political decision 
making for economic decision making." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1979 supply crisis, thousands of companies and individuals, ranging 
from big oil refining firms to individual service stations, filed appeals with 
the government, seeking additional supplies of petroleum. Federal officials 
tried to recreate the normal marketplace, setting prices and distributing 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Although Congress seemingly has no appetite for trying price and supply 
controls again, its members are angry with the sudden explosion in prices. 
Wholesale and retail charges are soaring for products made from oil already 
purchased at the old price of $15 a barrel or less. Prices jumped as high as 
$28 a barrel in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"American consumers deserve to know that they are not being gouged by 
escalating gasoline prices," Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said 
Wednesday. "The crisis in the Persian Gulf could damage our economy as it is. 
For American business to inflict even greater damage would be unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased to hear President Bush calling upon the oil companies to show 
restraint on consumer prices," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), 
chairman of the antitrust subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"However, consumers already have been ripped off by unjustified price hikes, 
and I hope the President will go further and persuade the oil companies to roll 
back prices," Metzenbaum said. His subcommittee "will look into possible oil 
company price fixing and will consider whether legislation is necessary," 
Metzenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sharp said a conspiracy isn't needed to drive up oil prices. "No one 
in the oil business has to get together around a table and meet to raise 
prices. If you're an oil company executive, you just look at what is happening, 
and say to yourself, 'We'll raise prices, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
The President was hopeful that the price hike is temporary. "And I hope that 
this rapid spike on oil prices will not be permanent, and I think if we -- if 
the world -- begins to see assurances that there will not be a dramatic cutoff 
or cut down on oil, that then things will return much more to normal in the 
market," Bush said.

MAJOR DEALS MARK O.C. AS HOT PROPERTY; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: MANY OF THE LARGEST DEALS IN LAND AND OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE 
SOUTHLAND HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN ORANGE COUNTY. JAPANESE FIRMS FIGURE 
PROMINENTLY IN THE TRANSACTIONS.

<P>
When big real estate investors haul out their wallets in Southern California 
these days, they're as likely to be buying property in Orange County as in Los 
Angeles or San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 25 biggest transactions in Southern California through 1989 and 
into this year were in Orange County. Of the 10 largest deals in the region, 
half were in Orange County, according to a survey by San Diego's Comps Inc. for 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 11 of the 25 largest deals were in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the major pacts in Orange County in 1989 and early 1990 involved land 
rather than buildings. But there were also some big sales of recently built 
Orange County office towers as the once-suburban county rapidly urbanizes. 
Those sales came despite bargain-basement office rents in Orange County -- and 
throughout Southern California -- because of a glut of office space. In fact, 
the weak market has scared off many U.S. institutional investors such as 
pension funds, said Joseph A. Leon, a commercial real estate broker at Coldwell 
Banker's Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
"The market's very soft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So the two biggest Orange County office deals were done by Japanese investors, 
who have spread out from the big markets of Los Angeles and New York to 
secondary markets including Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Those transactions include the third-largest in Southern California in the last 
year and a half: The $82-million sale of Los Angeles-based Transamerica 
Insurance Co.'s interest in two buildings at Koll Center Irvine Southwest near 
John Wayne Airport to a group of Japanese companies calling themselves World 
Trade Center Building. The deal, which closed in October, included the 11-story 
Transamerica Building and the five-story Marine National Bank building, 
totaling 345,000 square feet. Transamerica sold because it wanted out of the 
anemic office market. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Co., the big Newport Beach developer that built the office towers in 
partnership with Transamerica, retains an unspecified amount of ownership in 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-largest deal in Southern California was the $80-million sale of The 
Atrium in Irvine near John Wayne Airport, two 10-story towers linked by a glass 
atrium. Although the buildings' 336,000 square feet were nearly all leased, the 
rates were so low that the owners were said to be having a tough time making a 
profit. The building was sold in late 1989 by local developers French &amp; 
McKenna to Hyogo Real Estate USA Inc., a Japanese investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese may not be able to maintain such a strong presence in the 
local market, said Leon of Coldwell Banker. Interest rates are rising in Japan, 
and many of the big players already hold well-stocked real estate portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Leon said, investors from other Pacific Rim nations may take up the 
slack as some, including Taiwan and Korea, loosen foreign investment 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Big apartment deals are slow ing, the Comps survey shows. Real estate brokers 
say owners want unrealistically high prices given their inability to raise 
rents much. 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, investors were paying these wild prices," said Julie M. 
Hagberg of Apartment Properties, a Santa Ana investor and broker. "Now the 
banks and the thrifts are a little more conservative and a little more 
experienced, and you just can't get financing to buy most apartments." 
</P>
<P>
And there were as many deals for large, expensive tracts of land around 
Southern California as there were for office buildings, according to the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
The two largest land transactions in the region in the last 1 1/2 years were in 
Orange County: The $75-million purchase of 3,510 acres near San Clemente called 
Talega Valley, and the $71-million purchase of 224 acres around the Los 
Alamitos Race Course in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, Florida developer Arvida Corp. plans to build 5,000 homes on 
the land it bought from Talega Valley Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
In Cypress, buyer Cypress Development Partnership plans to build offices and a 
hotel, and to refurbish the race track and a nearby golf course on the property 
it bought from Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc.

STEERING HOME BUYER TO LENDER FOR FEE CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
MORTGAGES: PRUDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AFFILIATES INC. OF COSTA MESA IS ONE BROKER 
WHO ACCEPTS REIMBURSEMENT FROM LENDERS FOR REFERRALS. A TRADE GROUP ASSAILS THE 
PRACTICE.

Real estate agents who accept fees for linking home buyers with mortgage 
lenders are shortchanging the clients they are paid to represent and the 
practice should be made illegal, a congressional panel was told Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the House banking subcommittee on housing and community 
development, a trade group representing mortgage bankers criticized Prudential 
Real Estate Affiliates Inc. of Costa Mesa and other real estate brokers who 
accept reimbursement from lenders for referring home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamentally wrong for a real estate broker, who is receiving a 
substantial commission from the seller of a home, to have a financial interest 
in where the buyer of the home gets a mortgage," said Ronnie J. Wynn, president 
of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential and Citicorp Mortgage have created a computerized loan-origination 
system that is made available to real estate agents across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Under Prudential's system, agents help home buyers find mortgages offered by 
Prudential and a handful of other participating lenders. When a buyer selects a 
mortgage, the lender pays Prudential a fee of $425, and Prudential passes along 
$100 to the real estate agent. Prudential says the $100 is to defray the cost 
of operating the computer system, not a referral fee. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp Mortgage lists loans offered only by Citicorp but also pays agents who 
use the service. 
</P>
<P>
Most mortgage bankers are excluded from the systems and their trade group said 
it wants Congress to outlaw the practice through an amendment to the Real 
Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA). 
</P>
<P>
In separate testimony, the National Assn. of Realtors told the subcommittee 
that the computer systems do not create conflicts of interest or result in 
discrimination against mortgage bankers who do not participate. 
</P>
<P>
The group also said the computers do not increase the cost to consumers of 
buying a home. It argued that the listings streamline the process of buying a 
home because borrowers can conduct more tasks at the broker's office. 
</P>
<P>
But Wynn said the payments raise the cost of housing, encourage steering of 
buyers to participating lenders and discourage competitive mortgage pricing. 
</P>
<P>
"MBA strongly believes referral fees do not add value but create an environment 
that could undermine the integrity of the mortgage process, while adding 
unnecessary costs to the American home buyer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development approved Citicorp's 
MortgagePower service in 1986 and Prudential's Computerized Loan Origination 
System in 1988. Although these are the two biggest networks, mortgage bankers 
said smaller systems are springing up around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard N. Druger, vice chairman of Citicorp, said MortgagePower features 
faster loan approvals, limited documentation requirements, reduced origination 
costs, and superior levels of service for borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been virtually no consumer complaints about the program," Druger 
said. "In addition, no one has ever brought to our attention a single consumer 
complaint filed against our program with HUD. The complaints Citicorp has heard 
have been from its competitors. It is the competition, not the consumer, that 
has stirred the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
RESPA, which is designed to protect home buyers from excessive closing costs, 
bans referral fees but says a broker can be given "reasonable value for 
services provided." Real estate agents argue that the fees they receive fall 
into the latter category. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed rule banning the fees was tentatively approved by HUD in 1988, but 
it was not allowed to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized system "is not magical, is not a cure-all, and is anything but 
objective," said E. Robert Levy, executive director and legal counsel for MBA. 
"It is too easy to abuse this system. Congress must stop it. It's an 
intolerable conflict. It doesn't work."

FOOTBALL: BLUE-AND-GOLD FANS SOAK UP THE LOCAL COLOR OF MUNICH WHILE WARMING UP 
FOR THE L.A.-KANSAS CITY GAME SATURDAY IN BERLIN.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Have a mass of beer!" 
</P>
<P>
That was the advice given to members of the Rams booster club minutes after 
their arrival in Munich. "And have it the traditional way," added a lively tour 
guide. "One liter at a time with white radish and pretzels. Then you'll know 
the flavor of Bavaria." 
</P>
<P>
It was then and there that the boosters knew their Bavarian fling -- the one 
that would take them to Berlin for Saturday's game between the Los Angeles Rams 
and the Kansas City Chiefs -- wasn't going to be any teetotaling trip for 
sissies. 
</P>
<P>
But alas, it poured rain on the capital of Bavaria on Monday. So the boosters 
-- 90 strong and decked out in their Rams blue and gold finery -- had to go 
indoors and forgo the legendary joys of swilling beer out of mugs under the 
leafy shade of chestnut trees. No problem. Some of them simply set out for 
Mexican food at a spot around the corner from their Munchen Park Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't bad," Jim Ort said over breakfast the following morning. Others set 
out for a nearby pub to quaff a few mugs of what the locals call "liquid bread" 
and dine on kraut and frankfurters before crashing after their 11-hour flight 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't worried about getting their share of brewskies. Their travel 
itinerary promised a visit to the famous Hofbrauhaus for their next night on 
the town. And they had been told that the beers there have heads on them like 
snowballs and that there would be oompah bands, stein-slinging women in dirndl 
skirts, pork knuckles (a Munich speciality), potatoes with bacon and apple cake 
with cream. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't disappointed. "This reminds me of the Crackers nightclub in 
Anaheim!" said Mary Jane Stratman, her eyes drinking in the sight of the 
vaunted beer hall where Adolf Hitler first revealed his plans for the National 
Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 visitors from around the world shared the Festsaal (festival room) 
on the third floor of the Hofbrauhaus with the boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Up for merrymaking: Ear-splitting yodelers, woodchoppers, knee-slapping 
dancers, bell ringers, a brass band and beer served up six mugs at a time by 
frauleins with brawn. 
</P>
<P>
"This reminds me of a Rams' tailgate party," said Booster Club president Judy 
Matthews, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Henderson had only downed one liter of beer when he led the boosters in 
a robust cheer. "Give me an R!" Henderson yelled. "Now give me an A-M-S! What 
does that spell?" 
</P>
<P>
"Rams!" screamed the boosters, hoisting their mugs. "Goooo Rams!" 
</P>
<P>
After a first course of noodle soup, the boosters tried their hand at dancing 
in the isles. Ort and his wife, Ronni, were first on the dance floor, cutting a 
mean polka. Then Jim invited fellow booster Ron Lais for a spin on the worn 
parquet. Lais danced for about 30 seconds, then left Ort standing alone on the 
dance floor. "He's a lousy dancer," Lais teased. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept trying to lead!" Jim replied. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of night. Before the last song was sung (including a rousing 
rendition of "Anchors Away"), the boosters had sung happy birthday to 
Henderson, Joel Vest, Dee Crockett, Carroll Connet and Bart Wade. All were 
celebrating their birthdays during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
And they had dined on pigs' knuckles with style. "Remember," Jim Brand told his 
tablemates, "this is pigs' knuckles, not pigs' feet. You don't have to worry 
about the hooves." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't this great?" asked Boomer Steeman, celebrating his 30th anniversary with 
his wife, Judy. "Everybody is so happy! It's hard to pull that off in Orange 
County, unless maybe you're at a Rams game." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the boosters -- many of them still sporting their Rams blue 
and gold (right down to Joan Ann Faria's gold Rams-head ring with sapphire 
eyes) -- had boarded mega-buses to tour Munich, the capital of Bavaria and 
Germany's third largest city after Berlin and Hamburg. There was a stop at the 
English Garden, built 201 years ago to imitate England's Hyde Park. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go there, you might see nude people strolling on the paths," warned 
Monica, a thirtysomething tour guide with blunt-cut red hair. "But the police 
don't bother with them. They know they'll leave the park when it gets cold." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, swell," came a female voice from the back of the bus. "Now I suppose all 
of our husbands are going to become joggers." 
</P>
<P>
And there were stops at the site of the 1972 Olympics, and also at the emerald 
green "artificial hills," as Monica called them, which were actually piles of 
rubble from World War II which the German government had covered with grass and 
planted with shade trees. 
</P>
<P>
The boosters also got to see the beautiful castle Nymphenburg with its 
swan-covered lake. 
</P>
<P>
But always there was talk of brew. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kingdom of beer. It is our country's most beloved sport," said 
Monica, adding that the name Munich comes from the word monk, and that it was 
monks who brewed Germany's first beers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 900 breweries in Germany," Monica added, "one half of all the 
breweries in the world. And the glasses are so big you can drown yourself or 
your sorrows in them. Some men here drink like horses -- five to six liters at 
a sitting. They even give beer to babies here." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Lowenbrau Brewery, boosters caught glimpses of quaint residences 
with window boxes spilling scarlet geraniums as they rode around downtown 
Munich. 
</P>
<P>
And there were the store windows crammed with pretzels the size of small kites 
and tidy gardens ablaze with purple hydrangeas. 
</P>
<P>
The boosters broke into applause when they spotted Old Glory waving atop the 
United States Embassy. Monica seemed to have a lump in her throat when she 
said: "Here, you are in a once-destroyed country." 
</P>
<P>
When the bus reached the center of Munich, a parade booming with the sound of 
tubas marched by. "There goes Georgia!" joked Dennis Henderson, enjoying the 
trip with his wife, Elaine. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the touristy distractions, Rams owner Georgia Frontiere was never 
far from the minds of the boosters. The Rams were the reason they were here and 
believing that the Rams were going to scalp the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday, 
wouldn't it be just like Georgia to stage a parade?

AIDS QUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Individually, the panels are made of blankets, burlap, felt and velvet. Some 
are fancy and colorful, others plain and somber. Combined, the panels form the 
AIDS Memorial Quilt. The national quilt, sections of which are on display 
around the country, now is made up of more than 11,000 3-by-6-foot panels made 
by family, friends, lovers and even strangers. An 11,000-square-foot portion 
stitched from 640 panels will line the walls of two UCI student activity 
buildings Friday through Sunday, the first major viewing in Orange County. As 
of May, more than 83,000 people nationwide have died of AIDS, 17,400 of them in 
California, 921 in Orange County. Here are the stories behind three of the 
panels: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Craig Johnson 
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
<P>
Craig Johnson designed his own panel for the AIDS quilt on a piece of paper 
while lying in his bed at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted it simple: a black background on which "Craig" was spelled out in 
colorful, large flowers. 
</P>
<P>
He then asked his mother, Jean, to make it for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched him draw his own design, and I felt such pain because he knew the 
panel wasn't going to be made until he died," she said. "It was very important 
for him to be remembered. He didn't want to be forgotten. The panel was a way 
for him to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
Craig was 30 when he died a month later. At 6 feet, 2 inches tall, his 
once-sturdy, 165-pound frame had shriveled to 100 pounds. He was covered from 
his scalp to his toes with Kaposi's sarcoma, a form of skin cancer that dotted 
his body with purplish lesions. The lesions didn't stop on the outside. They 
covered his lungs, his eyes and blocked his intestines, causing him to vomit 
when he tried to eat. He also fought herpes and tuberculosis, against which his 
weakened immune system was virtually helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like his body was eating itself up," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Death might have seemed like a relief, but not for her son, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"Craig never wanted to die," Jean said. "He didn't give up his life without a 
fight. He tried so hard." 
</P>
<P>
Craig was an urban planner for the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, where he helped design the county's light-rail system. He worked 
mainly on the El Segundo line. A handsome man with a boyish grin, he liked 
hiking and camping at Yosemite. He loved the outdoors, and he drove hundreds of 
miles from his home in Los Angeles to watch the spring flowers bloom in the 
deserts. He tried sailing and even sky-diving. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Craig kept his illness a secret from his mother. He didn't want her 
to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Johnson, who is 54 and a retired Gemco department store clerk, admits that 
she is still coming to terms with her son's death. During his two-month stay at 
Hoag, she slept on a couch in his room. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview at her new home, Jean said she had learned accidentally 
that her son had contracted AIDS. She had accompanied him on a July, 1987, 
sky-diving trip to Lake Perris in Riverside County. After his jump, she helped 
her son out of his chute and saw six purple lesions on his arms and back. Her 
heart quickened. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the world had stopped," she said, pausing to look at a photo of 
Craig on her coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about AIDS, but everything seem so vague. You never thought it could 
happen in your family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When Jean confronted her son, he held her while she cried. 
</P>
<P>
Craig continued working on the rail line until March, 1988, when he became too 
weak. Finally, unable to care for himself, he moved back to his mother's home 
in Costa Mesa before transferring to Hoag. 
</P>
<P>
He read the latest research on AIDS and any advances in fighting the disease. 
He didn't want his muscles to deteriorate, so he tried to take daily walks in 
the hospital hallway. When he felt a little stronger, he lifted three-pound 
weights. 
</P>
<P>
But with all his hoping, he was also realistic. One day, he planned his own 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
There were to be some flowers, a little food and some words spoken. He asked 
that "The Rose" be sung. He wanted everyone to come casual. There was to be no 
fuss or pageantry. He just wanted a ceremony at Aliso Beach, where he used to 
sit by the water and watch the sun set. He asked to be cremated and his ashes 
scattered in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"He was matter of fact about it," his mother said. "He didn't want me to be 
burdened." 
</P>
<P>
He died at 3 a.m. Oct. 23, 1988. Jean watched him let go. 
</P>
<P>
"He sort of folded in like a flower," she said. "He collapsed into himself and 
he was gone, totally gone." 
</P>
<P>
The family held his funeral and scattered his ashes, but it took his mother 
several months before she could make his panel. 
</P>
<P>
She started working on it shortly before the first anniversary of his death. 
She wanted it to be part of the October, 1989, AIDS Memorial Quilt display in 
Washington at the capital's mall. 
</P>
<P>
She bought black velvet for the background and picked out brightly colored 
fabric for the letters. She cut the fabric and fashioned poppies as big as her 
hand. Then she sewed each flower to form the letters of her son's name. 
</P>
<P>
She worked on it for nearly two months, spreading out the panel across her 
living room floor and attaching each letter. When she finished it one 
afternoon, she quickly wrapped it up and mailed it to Washington in time for 
the display. 
</P>
<P>
The next time she saw her son's panel, it was stitched to hundreds of others. 
The Washington Monument loomed in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"All the panels were there, and they all seemed to reach up to heaven," she 
said. "I felt as if Craig was finally free." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steven Shaw 
</P>
<P>
GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
<P>
Steven Shaw loved Doris Day. 
</P>
<P>
While other teen-agers bought the Beach Boys and the Beatles, he collected 
Doris Day albums, wrote her fan letters and hung her posters in his room. One 
of his favorite movies was "The Man Who Knew Too Much," where Day sang "Que 
Sera Sera" while searching for her kidnaped son in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
When he left home in 1975 to become a disc jockey in Houston, he took his Doris 
Day album collection along. Twelve years later, he hired a truck to bring the 
records back with him when he returned, sick with AIDS, to his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he had a crush on Doris Day," said Joan Shaw, his mother. "He loved 
her so much. Sometimes I think he lived a little longer cause he had someone he 
idolized so much." 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS virus was first diagnosed in Steven in 1982. He had been working in 
Houston, where he was known on the dance circuit as the "disc jockey from Los 
Angeles." At the time, few knew about AIDS. Steven kept getting colds and would 
call his mother often to talk about the various ailments. 
</P>
<P>
After the diagnosis, he returned to Orange County, where he was put in an 
experimental drug program at USC. But nothing seemed to help and, within 
months, he dropped from 175 pounds to 145. He was never warm enough, even with 
a heater going 24 hours a day. His mother would bring him large sweaters and 
heavy shirts that would sag on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"One pill made him yellow, another pill made him brown, And still another pill 
made him throw up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Shaw, a home child-care operator, has left her oldest son's room pretty 
much the same since he died at age 37 on March 8, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Shaw family doesn't want to give away all of his things, not just yet. A 
shelf full of videotapes reaching from the ceiling to the floor fills two 
corners of the room. There's a poster of Doris Day's "April in Paris" and "My 
Dream Is Yours" on one wall. His green robe still hangs in the closet and a 
pair of his brown baby cowboy boots, unbronzed, sits near a lamp. 
</P>
<P>
Dotted throughout the room are photos of Steven. He was an accomplished 
teen-age tap and jazz dancer and had his own group, "Steve and His Girls." He 
had taken lessons at the Jean Lockin Dance Studio in Anaheim for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of his bed are his color television and VCR. At night, he and his 
mother would watch Doris Day movies and share snacks. They hummed along with 
the tunes and recited almost every line in the scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she fell asleep before her son. He would wake her up with a tap on 
her arm and whisper, "Isn't it time for you to go to bed?" 
</P>
<P>
During the day, he watched cooking shows and wrote down dozens of recipes for 
his mother. Most of the time, he recorded hundreds of music tapes for his 
friends from the 20,000 records in his collection. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Steven was not feeling well, he dragged himself out of the house to 
peruse albums at his favorite shops, said his youngest sister, Melanie, 22, who 
drove him to the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"He would go up and down the aisles and buy stacks," Melanie said. "Sometimes, 
he seemed so fragile, like he couldn't lift the records." 
</P>
<P>
Joan and her husband, John, a manufacturing supervisor, took their son to UCI 
Medical Center when he couldn't move the right side of his body. Twenty-four 
hours later, Steven was dead. His heart collapsed from blood poisoning, and he 
had no white cells left to fight disease. 
</P>
<P>
"You go day by day expecting him to die," his sister Melanie said. "But when he 
died, I couldn't accept it. I wanted more time. I wanted more time to be with 
him . . . to talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
A week after his death, Joan Shaw took the entire family to the Queen Mary in 
Long Beach, where a section of the quilt was being displayed. She wanted to see 
what kind of panel to make for her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to make a panel for him," she said. "I cried and cried when I was 
making it. But I felt a need to do it." 
</P>
<P>
It took her two weeks to make the panel. She picked her son's favorite color 
for the background, kelly green. On top, she printed his name in black, 
three-inch letters. Melanie designed a silver, glittering dance ball to dangle 
in the middle of his name. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Shaw pasted an 8-by-10 photo of Steven holding his cat, Pumpkin, on the 
right side of the quilt. On the left, she attached a mini-poster of Doris Day 
and Gene Nelson dancing in "Lullaby of Broadway." Then she covered the empty 
spaces with black felt records, each one with a different Doris Day song title. 
</P>
<P>
And on the bottom, Joan laid out a satin keyboard that stretched from one end 
of the panel to the other. On the keyboard are the words, "Que, Sera Sera, 
whatever will be, will be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard Avila 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
<P>
Richard Avila could never tell his parents that he had AIDS, even when he was 
bedridden at their home for three months with the deadly respiratory infection 
that led to his death. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors and friends in the 2nd Street neighborhood where Richard grew up 
thought he had double pneumonia. They knew little more. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Mexican culture, there are no good names for gays," said Virginia 
Avila, Richard's mother. "Maybe because of that, I was never open about my son 
being gay and having AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The Avila family knew that Richard was dying of AIDS. "Everyone thought about 
it constantly," said Ernestine Avila, Richard's sister-in law. "But nobody 
would say it in the open. Nobody could." 
</P>
<P>
Richard, the second oldest of seven children, would have been 39 on Aug. 17. A 
gregarious man with a penchant for bad jokes and old cars, he was always 
happy-go-lucky. As a teen-ager, he cruised along Bristol Street in his black, 
souped-up Malibu. He was a member of Santa Ana's Street Masters, an auto club. 
He could talk all night and laugh all day, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he became sick. 
</P>
<P>
His family suspected in 1987 that something was wrong when he abruptly quit his 
job as a furniture store delivery dispatcher to take a bicycle trip in Hawaii. 
He told friends he wanted a tan that would last forever. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, Richard came back and returned to his job. Then he 
contracted a cough that he couldn't shake. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, he was so tired all the time, he had no strength left," Virginia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Richard could barely breath, his family took him to Anaheim Kaiser 
Hospital. There, his brother, Phillip, persuaded Richard to be tested for AIDS. 
Then, for the first time in his life, Phillip saw his big brother cry. 
</P>
<P>
"To watch him cry was the hardest thing I've ever seen," Phillip said. "It was 
the first time we talked about the possibility that he had AIDS, and we broke 
down crying." 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, AIDS was diagnosed and Richard told Phillip. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things he said was, 'What do I tell Mom?' I told him he 
should tell her the truth," Phillip said. 
</P>
<P>
What made Richard's fight against AIDS more difficult was that he never 
disclosed his sexual orientation to his family, says Phillip, 30, who is also 
gay and had known about his older brother's sexual orientation for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only was Richard dealing with the disease, he was also coming to terms 
with the fact that everyone was finding out he was gay," Phillip said. "Since 
he wasn't openly gay at home, it made his fight harder." 
</P>
<P>
Richard couldn't tell the rest of his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want to hurt anyone," said Tina, 27, Richard's younger sister. "He 
didn't want anybody to be ashamed of him. He couldn't accept AIDS for himself, 
and I guess he couldn't see us accepting it either." 
</P>
<P>
And even though Richard was closest to his brother, Fred, and Fred's wife, 
Ernestine, he didn't tell them about his illness either. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Fred, who is a year younger, were inseparable as kids. When Fred 
and Ernestine married in 1972, Richard was best man. When Richard was 
bedridden, he sometimes called them to talk. It was during those conversations 
that Ernestine thought he wanted to tell them he was gay and that he had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"He talked about little things, a little chit-chat," she said. Then he was all 
quiet, like he had something important to say. But he never said anything." 
</P>
<P>
As Richard's health continued to fail, Virginia and her husband, Arthur, 
reached out to a support group for AIDS survivors, which helped them make 
funeral arrangements when Richard was dying. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to die even though I did not want to believe it," Virginia 
said. "I kept thinking something would save him, but I had to be realistic 
too." 
</P>
<P>
They chose a gray casket and a plot at Fairhaven Memorial Park, where the sun 
seemed to shine constantly. 
</P>
<P>
"All these crazy thoughts kept running through my mind," Virginia said. "I was 
thinking what colors would Richard like. . . . Would he be comfortable in this 
casket or not? But all I really wanted to do was to scream and cry and yell. 
But I didn't, I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Richard died Aug. 17, 1988 at age 37. Fluid from pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia, a leading cause of death among people with AIDS, flooded his lungs 
and he suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Virginia talks to Latino community groups about AIDS education and 
the importance of discussing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
And, after two years, she has finally made a quilt for Richard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the final chapter in Richard's life, and I didn't want that," 
Virginia said. 
</P>
<P>
With help from a family friend, Richard's panel was finished in June. On 
Richard's panel, there are palm trees on the bottom for all his trips to 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
On the left of the panel, there is a Street Masters insignia for his love of 
cars and fun. And on the right, Virginia has written, "Forever in Our Hearts," 
the theme of the Orange County quilt display. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is signed "Love, Mom and Dad."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHOR: SCI-FI'S BENFORD ALSO WRITES 'BAD' FAULKNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a professor of physics at UC Irvine who is also a noted science fiction 
author, Gregory Benford admits it's an unlikely honor. 
</P>
<P>
But the Laguna Beach resident has placed among the top 25 entrants in the first 
annual William Faulkner Write-Alike Contest. 
</P>
<P>
Benford's Faulkner parody will be one of 50 top contest entries that will be 
included in "The Best of Bad Faulkner," an anthology to be published in 1991 by 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich -- the same house that published "The Best of Bad 
Hemingway," a 1989 collection of entries in the now-defunct annual imitation 
Hemingway contest. 
</P>
<P>
The Faulkner contest, in which entrants had to write their best bad Faulkner in 
500 words or less, is co-sponsored by American Airlines' in-flight magazine, 
American Way; the English Department and the Center for the Study of Southern 
Culture at the University of Mississippi; and Yoknapatawpha Press, the Oxford, 
Miss.-based small trade publishing house named after the fictional county in 
which Faulkner set many of his books. 
</P>
<P>
Benford, a longtime fan of the Nobel prize-winning Southern author, read about 
the contest last year and entered it "on a lark." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd win," Benford said, adding that he almost threw away the 
recent notification letter, thinking it was an advertisement. "I was very 
surprised. I had completely forgotten about it." 
</P>
<P>
Benford's 400-word entry, a parody of Faulkner's famous novella "The Bear," is 
titled "The Bore." 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a rapacious Southern land developer," he said with a laugh. "It was 
written as one long paragraph, Faulknerian style -- roughly a page and a half, 
double spaced." 
</P>
<P>
It took Benford about two hours to write his entry. But then, as a native 
Alabamian, he has been reading Faulkner "since I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that most critics miss about Faulkner is that his famous 
storytelling voice is, in fact, a standard Southern storytelling voice that is 
typical of the Gulf Coast -- Mississippi, Alabama and so on." 
</P>
<P>
As a boy in the '40s, Benford said: "I heard stories told that same way, with 
the long rolling sentences, the digressions and the Biblical terminology all 
the time. I think that is why the South has so dominated American letters in 
this century, because it's the region that retains storytelling most strongly." 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the top winner of the Faulkner Write-Alike Contest is anything 
but Southern. 
</P>
<P>
He is Saul Rosenberg of London, who is working on a doctoral dissertation on 
Faulkner at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
The winner and two runners-up -- Jeffrey E. Simpson of Middletown, R.I., and 
Michael A. Crivello of Flower Mound, Tex. -- were selected by three celebrity 
judges: authors George Plimpton, William Styron and Willie Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Californians were among the top 50 contest entrants: John C. 
Richards of Los Angeles, Sally Jackoway of San Diego, Don Mangan of San Mateo 
and Clare A. Simmons of Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Contest officials figured they would be lucky if they received 250 entries in 
the first year of the contest. Instead, they received more than 650 submissions 
from 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, England and France. 
</P>
<P>
"We were staggered by the response to this," said contest coordinator Dean 
Wells in a phone interview from Oxford, where she and her novelist-husband, 
Larry, are, as they say, "the sole owners, proprietors and janitors" of 
Yoknapatawpha Press. 
</P>
<P>
The press, Wells said, publishes everything from facsimile editions of 
Faulkner's novels to football history books -- and "a lot of Willie Morris in 
between." 
</P>
<P>
It also publishes the quarterly Faulkner Newsletter and Yoknapatawpha Review, 
which provides information about the author to 285 Faulkner-loving subscribers. 
(The two contest runners-up will receive a 10-year subscription.) 
</P>
<P>
As the contest deadline neared last February, Wells said it got to the point 
where there were so many entries stacked on their dining room table that she 
and her husband couldn't even eat a meal on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bet next year we break 2,000," she said. "I think people just had so much 
fun with it. The entries were just hysterical. They were funny and brilliant 
parodies." 
</P>
<P>
"As I Lay Dying," one of Faulkner's most famous novels, prompted a string of 
similarly titled entries: "As I Lay Dieting," "As I Lay Crying," "As I Lay 
Frying." 
</P>
<P>
Because the three contest judges would not be able to read every single 
submission, the entries were initially screened by Dean and Larry Wells. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a committee from the university to help us, Faulkner scholars," Larry 
Wells said. "And even an old lady friend of Mr. Bill's -- that's what I call 
him -- stopped by to help us judge them." With a laugh, he added: "I won't name 
which one." 
</P>
<P>
One entry had only one line: "My fish is a mother" -- a play on Faulkner's 
famous line in "As I Lay Dying": "My mother is a fish." 
</P>
<P>
Most entries were more demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Faulkner prose is so dense to read, you had to stop after reading an hour or 
so and clear your mind and do something else," Larry Wells said. "You got 
satiated with Faulknerisms and Faulkneriana." 
</P>
<P>
For Dean Wells the contest is a labor of love: William Faulkner was her uncle. 
She called him Pappy. 
</P>
<P>
"All the children in the family grew up saying Pappy," she said. Her father, 
Dean Faulkner, was William Faulkner's youngest brother. A barnstormer, Dean 
Faulkner died in a plane crash before his daughter was born. "So Pappy 
certainly, in many ways, was a real pappy to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Wells has been having as much fun with the contest as the entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the winner of the Imitation Hemingway Contest was sent to Harry's 
Bar and Grill in Florence, Italy, "where they got exotic Italian food," Wells 
observes that the winner of the Faulkner Write-Alike Contest "gets flown into 
Oxford, Miss., in the worst part of the summer as far as heat is concerned to 
look forward to a diet of black-eyed peas and grits." 
</P>
<P>
As first-place winner, Rosenberg and a friend were flown by American Airlines 
to the weeklong Faulkner Yoknapatawpha Conference held last week at the 
University of Mississippi in Oxford. (Rosenberg actually landed in Memphis, 
Tenn. and was picked up by the Wellses, who drove him to Oxford. "We're so 
small, we don't have an airport," she said.) 
</P>
<P>
The couple can usually count on a lot of people dropping by their house during 
the Faulkner conference. As Dean Wells explains: "The whiskey's cheap and we 
never close." 
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony last week at Rowan Oak, Faulkner's home, George Plimpton 
presented Rosenberg with a first-place contest certificate; a plaque with 
Rosenberg's name -- and subsequent first-place winners -- will be installed at 
the university's Center for the Study of Southern Culture. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the local Holiday Inn also gave Rosenberg five nights of free 
lodging, and various restaurants in town provided free lunches and dinners. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of all that," she said, American Way magazine and United Airlines will 
be flying Rosenberg and a friend anywhere in the United States and the Bahamas 
for a five-day, free vacation "in any place that has a Marriott Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 contest entries have been published in the August issue of American 
Way magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Entries are now being accepted for next year's contest, which has a Feb. 1 
deadline. Entries, typed and doubled-spaced, should be sent to The Faulkner 
Newsletter, P.O. Box 248, Oxford, Miss., 38655. 
</P>
<P>
"Urge your readers to enter," Wells said. "The more the merrier." 
</P>
<P>
And what would William Faulkner, her beloved Pappy, think of the write-alike 
contest? 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think -- and there's no way to say -- but that he would be 
chuckling somewhere," she said. "It is such a wonderful tribute to him to have 
people all over the world not just read him, but to enter this contest and to 
know his works well enough and let their own wit and creativity turn loose on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Poets Reading: Catherine Spear and John W. Hart III will read at the Poets 
Reading meeting at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N. 
Pomona Ave., Fullerton. $3.

HOW TO BECOME A SELLER AT ORANGE COUNTY FARMERS' MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Eileen and Mark LaMorte began raising house plants and nursery stock in 
Anaheim 15 years ago, their greenhouses were surrounded by small, family-owned 
farms and chicken ranches. They sold their plants once a week at an open-air 
market conducted by local growers who harvested their produce at sunrise and 
sold it directly to consumers from the back of their truck. 
</P>
<P>
Now the LaMortes' greenhouses are surrounded by industrial buildings, and they 
are among the last Orange County-based sellers at the local farmers' markets. 
Those selling next to them are mostly from Riverside and San Diego counties or 
the San Joaquin Valley, where there is still land available on which to grow 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
But Mona Amoon, a co-manager of the state-sponsored Farmer's Market in 
Fullerton, knows that plenty of people in Orange County are back-yard farmers 
who set aside a portion of their precious land for an herb garden, vegetable 
patch or a couple of fruit trees. She hopes the "back-yard people," as she 
calls them, will join the ranks of sellers at the market and help it retain its 
neighborhood bazaar atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, several hundred buyers line up to choose from the market's selection 
of home-grown fruits, vegetables, honey, eggs, nuts, flowers, herbs, house 
plants and even fresh fish. So if you have just a single fruit tree or a row of 
tomato vines, you can call yourself a farmer, sell your goods at the market, 
make some extra money and meet your neighbors too. But first, you must become 
certified. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it's done: 
</P>
<P>
* Get an application form from the Orange County Agricultural Commission. The 
completed form will list your name, address, type of commodity grown and the 
amount of space devoted to production. 
</P>
<P>
* Make an appointment with an Agricultural Commission inspector, who will visit 
your home to verify the crop is grown at the site listed on the form. A 
certificate will be issued, and you can then sell your goods at any of the 
farmers' markets that the California Department of Food and Agriculture has 
established throughout the state. But there's one potential problem: If you 
live in an area that has been quarantined to control the Mediterranean fruit 
fly, you may not be able to sell your produce until the ban has been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
There are two farmers' markets in Orange County: one in Fullerton and the other 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers do not rent space at the markets, but are charged a percentage of their 
daily gross sales. The amount charged varies at each of the markets. Contact 
the individual market managers listed below for further information or call the 
CDFA Direct Marketing Program at 1-800-952-5272. 
</P>
<P>
* Orange County Agricultural Commission: 1010 S. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim (714) 
447-7100. 
</P>
<P>
* Fullerton Farmer's Market: Woodcrest Park, 450 W. Orangethorpe Ave. 
</P>
<P>

PARRISH HOMER GIVES ANGELS WIN IN 11TH

Dave Winfield's seventh-inning error opened the way for a four-run Boston rally 
Wednesday night, but the Red Sox had no closer, and the Angels walked through 
the door to grab an 8-6 victory on Lance Parrish's two-run home run with two 
out in the 11th inning. 
</P>
<P>
Ending an 0-for-21 slump that included 10 strikeouts, Parrish hit a 1-and-2 
pitch from Dennis Lamp -- Boston's fourth pitcher -- into the left-field seats 
after Brian Downing had singled to left. The home run, Parrish's 18th, gave him 
52 runs batted in this season, two more than he had last season. It gave Willie 
Fraser his third victory to balance three losses, and it ended the 4-hour 
6-minute game at Anaheim Stadium, which drew 29,362. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, whose bullpen lost Jeff Reardon to back surgery last week, saw 
their American League East lead over Toronto cut to one game. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels capitalized on the shakiness of Boston's bullpen to score three 
times in the eighth and tie the game in the ninth on Max Venable's two-out, 
pinch-hit single. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield led off the eighth with a single to left and scored on Lee Stevens' 
double to right-center. Downing scored Stevens for his second RBI of the game 
with a single to right. Parrish popped up and Dick Schofield walked, and the 
Red Sox went to reliever Rob Murphy. Angel Manager Doug Rader sent Dante 
Bichette to hit for Luis Polonia, and Bichette came through with a single to 
center that scored Downing. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels tied the game in dramatic fashion. Winfield walked but was thrown 
out at second on Stevens' fielder's choice. Downing walked, moving Stevens to 
second and inducing Boston to bring in Lamp (3-4). The veteran right-hander 
struck out Parrish, but Venable singled, scoring Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
In scoring for the fourth time, Stevens tied a club record for most runs scored 
in a game. 
</P>
<P>
This came on a day when right field provided no refuge for Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
After being besieged by reporters to comment on a Sports Illustrated story 
alleging that he had bet on sports events, Winfield escaped interrogation when 
the game began. 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't avoid trouble, misplaying Carlos Quintana's seventh-inning fly 
ball to help Boston score four unearned runs that gave the Red Sox a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill had settled down after a rocky start and seemed on solid ground 
in the seventh after yielding a one-out single to rookie Tim Naehring. 
McCaskill struck out Jody Reed. Then, Quintana hit a fly ball to right that 
dropped between Winfield's glove and his hand for an error that allowed 
Naehring to score the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs added a run-scoring double, and Ellis Burks and Dwight Evans each 
contributed run-scoring singles. 
</P>
<P>
Naehring had his first four-hit game, and Boggs extended his hitting streak to 
11 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored three times in the eighth off Greg Harris, Jerry Reed and 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill allowed only two earned runs but fell to 1-6 with one no-decision in 
his last eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill yielded two runs in the first, but slick fielding helped limit the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Reed led off with a sharp single to center and was forced at second when second 
baseman Donnie Hill made a fine diving stop on Quintana's shot to the right 
side. Boggs moved within 70 hits of his eighth consecutive 200-hit season when 
he singled to right, moving Quintana to second. Burks followed with another 
single to right, scoring Quintana and moving Boggs to third. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill dodged danger by getting Mike Greenwell to hit into a force play and 
Evans to fly to Hill in short right field. That was a temporary lull, as Tom 
Brunansky opened the second with a single to right. But again, the Angels' 
infield came through. Hill turned Tony Pena's grounder into a force on 
Brunansky and after Naehring singled and Reed popped up, Kent Anderson turned a 
force play on Quintana's grounder to third. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens cut the Angels' deficit to 2-1 with his leadoff homer in the second, a 
drive to the right of the 404-foot sign in center field. The home run was his 
fourth in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill helped his own cause in the sixth. After walking Burks, the leadoff 
hitter, he made a fine pickoff move that got Burks by a wide margin. Greenwell 
singled but Evans popped up and Brunansky struck out. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels repaid him by tying the game in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels delayed activating Chili Davis and returning pitcher Joe Grahe to 
triple-A Edmonton in order to ensure their starting staff is at full strength. 
Bert Blyleven missed his last turn after four members of his family were in a 
car accident and Chuck Finley has been absent since Sunday, when he returned to 
Louisiana for the funeral of his 8-month-old nephew. Manager Doug Rader said 
the move could come today, once Finley returns and Blyleven is judged ready to 
start Friday. "Chili's not going to go on rehab, so we can work him extra hard 
another day," Rader said. . . . The return of reliever Bob McClure is also 
imminent. McClure, who has yet to pitch this season because of elbow problems, 
appeared ready after a good simulated inning Wednesday.

REST IS BEST FOR SCIOSCIA; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: CATCHER DOESN'T LIKE IT, BUT HIS PERFORMANCE IN 4-2 VICTORY OVER REDS 
SHOWS VALUE OF DAYS OFF. 
</P>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Mike Scioscia proved again Wednesday night, there is a reason Dodger Manager 
Tom Lasorda endures his starting catcher's occasional shouting and slamming of 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble Scioscia causes when he is benched is nothing compared to the 
damage he does the next time he plays. 
</P>
<P>
Working on two days' rest, an irritated but fresh Scioscia worked over the 
Cincinnati Reds with two doubles, two singles and two runs batted in. He 
combined with Fernando Valenzuela, who pitched his first complete game since 
his no-hitter June 29, to lead the Dodgers to a 4-2 victory before 30,700 at 
Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia has been rested 21 times this season, including Tuesday night's 1-0 
loss. In his starts after those days off, he has 24 hits in 75 at-bats for a 
.320 average with three homers and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't print that statistic," Scioscia said, seriously, after his fourth-inning 
RBI single proved to be the game-winner. "They read that, they will want to 
start benching me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
That is not likely. Scioscia is on a pace to reach career highs with 10 home 
runs and 49 RBIs with a .272 average that would rank as his best since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are on a pace to drive their fans crazy. The victory moves them to 
within eight games of first-place Cincinnati in the National League West after 
appearing on the verge of elimination in Tuesday's heartbreaking loss. 
</P>
<P>
"A loss like that felt like running over a cat," said Lenny Harris, who dirtied 
his uniform with several fine plays at third base. "Usually a loss like that 
would have knocked a team out . . . and if we had lost today, I think we might 
have been out. But look, we're right back in there." 
</P>
<P>
Today's finale will match the league's top two young pitchers, the Dodgers' 
Ramon Martinez and the Reds' Jack Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't also feature Scioscia in the starting lineup, you'll hear about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I've gotten upset by not being in the lineup -- probably more than once 
that's happened," Scioscia said. "I know as a catcher you need days off, but 
it's hard to sit and take them. . . . I'm never happy on the bench, I never 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia admitted that an occasional rest feels good. But not that good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still sore after two days off," he said, shrugging. "Maybe mentally I feel 
better. I feel a little fresher, but my impact on this team is with defense and 
helping the pitchers, and I can stay fresh a long time defensively." 
</P>
<P>
By playing in 94 games, more than all but two other catchers in the National 
League, Scioscia has become one of the Dodger symbols of stability in a season 
marked by the wild fluctuations found in Wednesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers fell behind, 2-0, in the first inning when Alfredo Griffin, in the 
worst slumps of his career, made an error and Chris Sabo then hit a two-run 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers tied it in the second inning on Scioscia's RBI single and a 
double-play grounder by Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin threw Barry Larkin's grounder into the Reds' dugout to begin the third 
inning, and only some smart pitching by Valenzuela extracted him from a jam in 
which Larkin was stranded on third by a foul out by Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
After the inning Lasorda found Griffin in the clubhouse, ushered him into the 
manager's office and closed the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to get back out there and tell every batter that you want the next 
ball hit to you," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Griffin: "Maybe next time I will try to throw it in the stands on purpose, 
and maybe then the ball will go to first base." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took the lead in the fourth inning on Scioscia's line drive to 
right field after Eddie Murray tripled off the left-field wall. It would have 
been a single or double, but Davis did not back up the play from center field. 
</P>
<P>
In what was a terrible night for the $9.3-million player, Davis also failed to 
run on his bloop hit to right field in the first inning because he thought the 
ball would be foul. A possible double became a single, and Davis was booed the 
rest of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get a grip on this magical thing. It's something I have to deal 
with," Davis said of season-long slump that has lowered his average to .226. 
"Frustration ain't going to help me." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Valenzuela was giving up five hits and no runs after that 
first inning in improving his record to 9-9 while lowering his earned-run 
average to 3.75. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell said he will be available tonight for the first time in a week after 
testing his swollen left knee by throwing for 10 minutes after the game. "It 
felt good. The swelling is down to about the size of an egg. I'm ready to go," 
said the Dodger reliever. . . . A good running session by Juan Samuel before 
the game persuaded the Dodgers to place him in the starting lineup for the 
first time in a week. He still appeared to favor his sprained left ankle in the 
field but ran hard down the first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Harris' good defense at third base included a diving stop of Billy 
Hatcher's line drive in the fifth inning and a sliding stop of a grounder by 
Joe Oliver in the seventh inning. Harris was pleased to perform well here 
because, when he was traded from Cincinnati last year, critics said his 
weakness was defense. "It meant a lot to me tonight because they were always 
talking about my defense here, and I showed them that their talk would not stop 
me," Harris said. "Only I know what I can and can't do." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers will move either Tim Crews or Mike Hartley into the rotation for 
next week's series in New York, which features four games in three days. . . . 
Joe Amalfitano returned to the third-base coaching box after receiving 22 
stitches for a cut behind his ear, which he suffered in a bathtub fall.

JIM MURRAY: IN BOXING, IT'S SAME NEW STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all began with Braddock. He was the original Rocky. If you saw Rocky I, that 
was the James J. Braddock story. Sylvester Stallone, a fight buff, was, no 
doubt, very familiar with the Braddock saga when he scripted the life and times 
of Rocky Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
They said Buster Douglas' knockout of heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was the 
greatest upset in boxing history. Maybe it was. But the Braddock upset is 
neck-and-neck. 
</P>
<P>
It came in the Depression '30s. Nobody had any money, least of all a 
down-and-out fighter in New Jersey named James Braddock. He and his wife and 
kids were not only broke, they were on relief. 
</P>
<P>
Braddock would get up in the morning and climb down the Jersey Palisades to the 
Hudson River waterfront, where he would get in the daily shape-up hoping for 
longshore work. When he got it, he got 50 cents an hour, lifting railroad ties 
out of ships and onto flatcars. His diet was day-old doughnuts sold at discount 
because they were stale. 
</P>
<P>
He had been a light-heavyweight contender. He didn't lose a fight his first 3 
1/2 years, but when he got his title shot, he just wasn't as good as the 
champs, the Tommy Loughrans and the Maxie Rosenblooms. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to work the docks by day and fight at night. He fought the guys no one 
else wanted to fight -- Al Gainer, Dynamite Jackson and John Henry Lewis, soon 
to be light-heavyweight champion. He fought them in their hometowns. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
He was going nowhere. He fought eight bouts in 1932 and he lost four of them. 
He got stopped by an in-and-outer named Lou Scozza. 
</P>
<P>
He was used, mainly, to make character for new, young phenoms. They invented 
the name "trial horse" for guys such as Braddock. 
</P>
<P>
That, ultimately, was his good fortune. His manager, Joe Gould, used to haunt 
the Madison Square Garden offices looking for a pay night for his fighter, and 
when they were looking for the classic "opponent" to look good on the record of 
a new hotshot fighter out of Georgia named Corn Griffin, Braddock seemed ideal. 
</P>
<P>
Corn Griffin knocked him down with the first punch of the fight. Braddock got 
up. He always got up. He knocked Griffin out in the third round. He got $250, 
which he paid back to the government for his relief. "I did that on hash," he 
told his manager. "Get me some steaks, and I'll clean out the division." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing had its own Apollo Creed as champ at that time, Max Baer, a guy with the 
build of a Greek god and the punch of a falling paving block, possessed of such 
a devastating right hand that he had killed two men in the ring with it. 
</P>
<P>
When Braddock got matched with Baer -- after whipping John Henry Lewis and Art 
Lasky, top contenders -- the New York writers feared the worst. "Baer may 
injure him fatally," warned Paul Gallico. "It will be surprising to me if we 
all don't end up in police court," wrote Davis J. Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Braddock not only lived, he gave Baer a thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
Braddock could do two things Rocky Balboa could -- he could take it and he was 
fearless. 
</P>
<P>
The Buster Douglas story has similarities to the James Braddock story. The 
Douglas record, like the Braddock, is dotted with losses. 
</P>
<P>
When he came through here this week promoting his upcoming title defense 
against Evander Holyfield, Douglas was asked if he could explain his so-so 
record leading up to the Tyson fight. Like Braddock, he had lost to nobodies. 
David Bey knocked him out in two rounds in 1981. Somebody named Mike White had 
knocked him out in five rounds in 1983. Someone named Jesse Ferguson beat him 
in 1985. And Tony Tucker knocked him out in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Like Braddock, he had the dreaded "NC" on his record. This stands for 
No-Contest and a set of circumstances where the referee stops the bout on the 
suspicion the fighters aren't trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was busy doing other things in those days," Buster explained. 
</P>
<P>
"What other things?" Buster was asked. "Making a living," explained Buster. "I 
was working in a carpet store, for one thing. I was laying carpet. I was losing 
fights outside the ring." 
</P>
<P>
He was trying to win fights on hash, too. 
</P>
<P>
What the two Kid Cinderellas did with their titles has its similarities. In 
Braddock's case, he was pointing toward a big-money shot with Joe Louis, when 
the young Brown Bomber made the mistake of scheduling a tuneup fight against 
Max Schmeling, who knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
That created terrible problems for the whole republic, let alone the champ. 
Braddock didn't want to fight Schmeling because he could get only about 
one-tenth the purse he could command with Louis. The country didn't want him to 
fight Schmeling because no one wanted the heavyweight title to go back to 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Braddock fought Louis in Chicago. He got knocked out in eight rounds. He 
floored Louis in the first round, but a Louis right almost tore his mouth in 
half in Round 8. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Douglas had his own dilemma. It is clear his big-money shot would be a 
return bout against Tyson. But for Douglas to get the shot at Tyson in Tokyo 
last February, Evander Holyfield had to waive his rights as No. 1 challenger. 
Max Schmeling would not do that in 1937, even coming to New York for a phantom 
weigh-in for a phantom bout. But Holyfield stepped aside in return for a 
guaranteed shot against the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Could Douglas have dishonored that pledge? Probably. It's done all the time in 
the fight game, whose symbol should not be the clenched fist but the 
outstretched palm. 
</P>
<P>
So, Buster is going to meet his obligations and fight Holyfield at the Mirage 
Hotel in Las Vegas on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Here he departs from the Braddock script. James J. not only stiffed Schmeling, 
he made an arrangement no commission could approve today. He agreed to run out 
on the Schmeling match and meet Louis for the title. In return, he got 10% of 
the purses of Louis' subsequent fights -- not from Louis' end, from the 
promoter's. 
</P>
<P>
James J. didn't want to go back to hash. Or on relief. Or lifting railroad 
ties. Like the Rocky movies, he wanted a happy ending, too.

PGA: GOLFERS WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT RACIAL CONTROVERSY AS 
MAJOR TOURNAMENT BEGINS AT SHOAL CREEK.

<P>
Nick Faldo could win his third major golf tournament of the year, Greg Norman 
could win his second ever. Jack Nicklaus could win on a course he designed, 
Payne Stewart could defend a title. Tom Kite could add to his record $6 million 
in career earnings, Hale Irwin could continue his middle-age renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
And no one will remember. At least, not at first they won't. 
</P>
<P>
Much against its will, the 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek has become a 
poster child for social reform. Its legacy is course founder Hall Thompson and 
his June 20 declaration in the Birmingham Post-Herald that the club wouldn't be 
pressured into accepting blacks. Its sporting significance is forever 
overshadowed by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's comments provoked outrage, disbelief and threats of protest. The PGA 
Championship, one of golf's four majors, found itself in turmoil and with 
little alternative except to confront the issue. PGA of America officials 
considered a change of venue -- both Memphis and Nicklaus' Muirfield Village in 
Ohio were contacted -- before a negotiated settlement was reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
The planned protests were averted when Shoal Creek extended an honorary 
membership to a black Birmingham insurance executive and promised to process 
the application of another local black citizen. But the PGA Championship, which 
begins today, has never been the same -- no matter how hard the PGA, tournament 
organizers and comment-shy PGA Tour players try. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's pre-tournament schedule included the annual State of the PGA of 
America news conference, usually a sparsely attended, dry affair that often 
packs the excitement of a convenience store opening. This time, the room was 
packed as PGA Chief Executive Officer Jim Awtrey and PGA President Pat Rielly 
introduced new selection guidelines for future PGA Championship sites beginning 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the PGA added to its existing criteria the stipulation that 
prospective clubs must demonstrate that their membership policies are 
non-discriminatory. Without such guarantees, a private club won't be eligible 
for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Those courses selected in 1995 will have minorities, including women and 
blacks as members," Awtrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Awtrey also accepted partial blame for the Shoal Creek controversy. When asked 
if the PGA would have altered its selection process had Thompson never granted 
his infamous interview with the Post-Herald, Awtrey said, "Well, certainly we 
may have been remiss in not addressing this in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Still to be determined is the status of those clubs already chosen as host 
sites for the PGA Championships in 1991 through '94. Awtrey would say only that 
the PGA is having "serious discussions" with those clubs, presumably to ensure 
that such criteria are met. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made it clear what our intentions are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So have the players, many of whom are reluctant to discuss the developments of 
the past few weeks. Ask them about the high, thick Bermuda grass that swallows 
errant drives at Shoal Creek, and the reactions are spirited and endless. Ask 
them about the ramifications of Thompson's comments, and the answers generally 
become guarded and brief. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment, next question," said Irwin, who won the U.S. Open and the 
Buick Open earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I play golf, I don't make policy," said Stewart, the defending PGA champion. 
"We play golf for a living. Discrimination is all over the world. It didn't 
start here at Shoal Creek. The players have probably made more jokes than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Norman, 0-for-majors in 1990, said he didn't want to "stir it up" with any 
comments, though he did allow that the attention was justified and the changes 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
And this from Nicklaus, who is playing in his 29th PGA Championship: "Old news 
as far as I'm concerned. We have talked enough about it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they would rather concentrate on familiar topics, such as the length 
of the rough -- 3 1/2 inches, still growing; and the greens -- hard, swift; and 
the favorite -- Faldo, winner of the Masters and the British Open this year.

Stewart was the most critical of the course's setup. He found fault with nearly 
everything, including the PGA of America's decision to let the rough grow long, 
as well as the firmness of the putting surface. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't play in the fairway, you can't play this golf course," he said. 
"A lot of guys will be hitting one-irons off the tee. There are a lot of holes 
where you will be hitting irons. That's not the way golf was meant to be 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who designed the course, said he recommended that the fairways be cut 
wider for the tournament. The PGA chose otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see the options in the play of golf," he said. "They felt like it 
would be more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The complaints rang somewhat hollow considering the recent turn of events. By 
all accounts, history was made here last week and it had nothing to do with 
Bermuda rough or thin fairways. 
</P>

PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Awtrey, PGA of America CEO, said that Kiawah (S.C.) Island, site of next 
year's Ryder Cup matches, already adheres to the new club selection standards. 
. . . Pat Rielly, PGA president and head professional at Pasadena's all-white 
Annandale Golf Club, said there is nothing he can do about the club's 
membership makeup. "The policy is set by Annandale," he said. "I don't feel 
awkward about it." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watson was named PGA of America player of the decade. Watson won three 
British Opens and one U.S. Open during the 1980s, as well as player-of-the-year 
honors twice. "I receive it with mixed feelings," he said. "The first part of 
the decade seemed like I built up a 10-shot lead. Then in the second half, I 
held on to win it." Watson last won a PGA Tour event in 1987 -- the Nabisco; 
and a major in 1983 -- the British Open. He has never won the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
If Payne Stewart repeats as PGA champion, it will mark the first time since 
stroke play was initiated in 1958 that a player has won the title two years in 
a row. . . . Jodie Mudd, Wayne Levi and Tony Sills withdrew from the 
tournament. Mudd was replaced by Jay Don Blake, Levi by Bill Sander and Sills 
by Ray Stewart.

American sprinter Leroy Burrell matched the best performance of the year by 
winning the 100-meter dash in 9.96 seconds at a track and field meet in 
Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell had been trying for a world record, aided by the high altitude.

Michael Johnson ran the 200 meters in 19.88 seconds, the second-fastest

bad curve compromised his record chances.

EDBERG DEFEATS SREJBER, BUT WILANDER IS OUSTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stefan Edberg advanced but fellow Swede Mats Wilander didn't in Wednesday's 
second-round singles matches of the ATP Championship at Mason, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg came back to beat Czechoslovakia's Milan Srejber, 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, still rusty from a four-month layoff, lost to Australia's Darren 
Cahill, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be up and down from the beginning," Wilander said. 
"Obviously, this is a down. You don't come out and play 75% of your ability 
right away; you play 100% one day and 20% the next. You just have to keep 
playing to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander has a 12-7 record on the ATP Tour this year and has not won a 
tournament in two years. 
</P>
<P>
In the night's featured matches, eighth-seeded John McEnroe beat Jean-Philippe 
Fleurian of France, 7-6 (6-3), 6-2, and defending champion Brad Gilbert 
defeated David Wheaton, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I volleyed pretty well, and I felt as if he were playing my style of game," 
McEnroe said. "I was picking up the ball better than I have in the last month 
or six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg has been bothered by a sprained left ankle that he injured Sunday during 
the final of the Los Angeles tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not 100% today, not even close to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg also had to overcome a 3-4, love-30 deficit in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when I was down a break in the third, I never thought it was over," 
Edberg said. "It's always hard to serve a match out." 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, seeded ninth, was eliminated by Scott 
Davis, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing were No. 5 Aaron Krickstein, who beat Sweden's Johan Carlsson, 6-2, 
7-6 (8-6); No. 6 Jay Berger, who defeated Nicolas Pereira of Uruguay, 6-2, 6-7 
(7-5), 6-4, and No. 7 Michael Chang defeated Israel's Amos Mansdorf, 6-0, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Anne Minter defeated Kathy May-Paben, 6-3, 6-4, during the second 
round in a $150,000 tournament at Albuquerque, N.M.

THIS FREE AGENT WAS A CATCH FOR RED SOX; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: LEAVING THE CARDINALS WAS THE BEST THING FOR TONY PENA AND FOR 
BOSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They say there is no place like New England when the Boston Red Sox are in the 
pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
To which Joe Morgan, who was born in Walpole, Mass., and grew up to become 
Boston's manager, says: "There's no place like New England, anytime, winter or 
summer, for me." 
</P>
<P>
For Tony Pena, born in the Dominican Republic, the Boston legacy and the 
feeling of a New England fall are strange. But they can agree on one thing: 
There's no place like a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
Pena thought the St. Louis Cardinals were going to win the National League East 
when he left them after last season, pushed out by the promise of young catcher 
Todd Zeile. 
</P>
<P>
At 33, Pena's defense is near its best, but his average slipped to .259 last 
season, his two .300 years with Pittsburgh in the early 1980s further and 
further behind. 
</P>
<P>
Pena left the Cardinals, with whom he hit .409 in the 1987 World Series loss to 
Minnesota, and signed a $6.4-million, three-year, free-agent contract with the 
Red Sox, changing leagues for the first time after nine years in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Cardinals are in last place and Whitey Herzog has resigned. And the Red 
Sox have a two-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East 
through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Whitey came to me two weeks before the season was over," Pena said. "Whitey 
wanted me to stay. I said, 'Don't even bother.' I already made up my mind. I'm 
not ready to platoon yet. Thank God, I made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, who play the Angels at Anaheim Stadium tonight in the final game 
of a three-game series, are working their way through a West Coast swing that 
has proved trying in years past, and they face the final two months of the 
season without stopper Jeff Reardon, who had 18 saves in 25 chances before 
undergoing surgery for a ruptured disk Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Pena has been one of the reasons the Red Sox are in first 
place, even though they have found themselves pitching-poor -- beyond the 
remarkable performance of Roger Clemens -- and so power-poor that they are next 
to last in the league in home runs. 
</P>
<P>
What has Pena done? 
</P>
<P>
"Plenty," Morgan said, with his customary brevity. "Next question." 
</P>
<P>
Pena started the season hitting .403 in April, which says something about who 
fared better with limited knowledge of the opponent -- Pena, not the pitchers. 
His average has since fallen to .254. It was last at .300 on May 26 and stood 
at .280 when he sprained his right thumb on June 11. He has six home runs, 
including a solo shot during the 6-3 victory over the Angels Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But since Pena has slumped, other Red Sox have kept the offense sturdy. Jody 
Reed, Carlos Quintana, Wade Boggs and Ellis Burks give them four starters 
hitting better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
More important than hitting is the defense and leadership Pena has provided. 
</P>
<P>
"(Red Sox General Manager) Lou Gorman told me, 'I want you to catch, call the 
game and throw people out. That's what I need,' " Pena said. "I don't worry 
about my hitting as much as calling the game. . . . I can separate the game, 
hitting and defense. If I don't hit, I just think about my catching. Keep the 
other ballclub close. We'll score the runs." 
</P>
<P>
He has also helped the Red Sox pitchers, such as Tom Bolton (6-1) and Greg 
Harris (9-4), both relievers who became starters. 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps on 'em all the time," Morgan said. "He won't let them stray too far 
before he gets on 'em. And people don't run on us like they did other years 
either." 
</P>
<P>
Harris says even Clemens, who needs little help considering he has a 15-5 
record and a 2.14 earned-run average, has benefited from Pena. 
</P>
<P>
"You're able to get low strikes, he's down so low," Harris said. "Roger has 
gotten a lot of low strikes. You're given a bigger plate because the umpire can 
see more of it. Also, even though you still have to work to hold runners on, 
he's so quick, he gets (throws) off. Runners can't get too aggressive because 
he can throw from his knees and pick them off first." 
</P>
<P>
First base is another place where Pena's influence has been felt. With Nick 
Esasky going to the Atlanta Braves as a free agent, the Red Sox sought a first 
baseman but never acquired one. The job fell to Quintana, 24, who entered the 
season with only 39 games in the majors. He started in a platoon situation but 
won the job by early May. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of Pena, who calls instructions down the first base line in 
Spanish during the game, Quintana is fielding his position well and hitting 
.315 with seven homers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's worked with Quintana since spring training," Morgan said. "I told him to 
work with him, and he has." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said it was a matter of Quintana getting the assurance that he owned the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"For a guy who never played first, I think he's doing an outstanding job," Pena 
said. "I don't think anybody could do a better job. . . . We talk a lot. When 
he does something wrong, I try to communicate how he can do it. But there's not 
much you can tell a guy, the way he's been able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Pena has been able to do his job, too, despite the difficulty of changing 
leagues and the pressures of signing a big free-agent contract. 
</P>
<P>
"For me it was not real hard," Pena said. "It was harder to go from Pittsburgh 
to St. Louis, than St. Louis to here. . . . I was ready for a challenge. I know 
it's not easy to make the change from one league to the other. I made the 
adjustments. Right on the first day I came to spring training, my team opened 
their arms to me. That was what I needed." 
</P>
<P>
In a year of noted free-agent failures, Pena has been a success. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect so much, it's tough," he said. "You're a free agent, you sign 
for so much money, and they think you're going to carry the team. I just do my 
best every single day. That's the only thing anybody can do." 
</P>
<P>
It is all the Red Sox can do as they try to hold off challengers in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of the fans are really rabid because we haven't won a World 
Series in a long time," Morgan said, musing about the crowds that come out to 
watch the Red Sox on the road. The team they pull for has not won a World 
Series since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always there," Morgan said.

TRIPLE PLAY IS RELIEF FOR MCDONALD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben McDonald is proving to be a good pitcher and a good-luck charm to boot for 
the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Although he needed the help of three relief pitchers and a triple play, 
McDonald was the winner in a 4-1 victory over the Athletics Wednesday at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie became the first Baltimore pitcher to win his first four decisions. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who pitched an inning Sunday at Kansas City before the game was 
rained out, had a one-hit shutout and a 4-0 lead before giving up three 
consecutive singles with one out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Frank Robinson decided McDonald had enough. Mark Williamson bailed him 
out of the jam, and when Williamson walked the first two batters in the 
seventh, Jeff Ballard took over. 
</P>
<P>
The first batter he faced, Willie Randolph, hit a hit-and-run line drive that 
Ballard snared and turned into an easy triple play. Exactly 13 years ago, the 
Athletics also hit into a triple play. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard was also on the mound last June 15 when the Orioles made a triple play 
that started with a line drive by New York's Steve Balboni. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation," Ballard said, "you're looking for a double-play ball. I 
just put my glove up. Luck. It was luck. Go ahead and say it. But it took the 
wind out of their sails." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Olson, who has never given up a run in August, went the final 1 2/3 
innings for his 26th save. The second-year bullpen ace has pitched 14 2/3 
innings in August. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonald is not just a rookie, he's an exceptional rookie," Robinson said. "He 
doesn't let all the hoopla, publicity get to him. He just goes out there and 
gets people out. He doesn't try to necessarily strike out people, he just gets 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries to Randy Milligan and other regulars, the Orioles had a 
makeshift lineup. They managed to get to Scott Sanderson (11-7) for all their 
runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Melvin broke out of a two-for-21 slump and drove in two runs with singles 
in the fourth and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics remained three games ahead in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Chicago 1 -- Carlton Fisk hit his 327th home run as a catcher to 
tie Johnny Bench for the all-time high, but it was the only damage done to Tom 
Gordon (7-8) at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk hit a 1-and-2 pitch over the left-field fence in the seventh. Gordon, who 
struck out eight, gave up only three other hits and no one but Fisk advanced as 
far as second. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not your classic home run hitter," Fisk said. "I'm more of a line drive 
hitter. I'm no Canseco." 
</P>
<P>
Fisk was met at the plate by his son Casey, 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I had goose bumps when he hugged his boy at home plate," Chicago Manager Jeff 
Torborg said. "That was beautiful. That's a big emotional thing right there. It 
meant so much to those two and that family." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Seitzer had three doubles to lead the assault on Greg Hibbard (9-6). 
Seitzer scored two runs and drove in two. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox had won six of seven. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 8, Detroit 3 -- Pat Borders keyed the offense at Toronto as the Blue 
Jays continued to exert pressure on the Red Sox in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Borders had a home run and two singles, scored three runs and drove in three. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff hit his 25th home run and the Blue Jays built a big lead for David 
Wells (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
The hard-throwing Wells managed to make it through five innings despite giving 
up eight hits and walking two. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Texas 3 -- Chris James had his fifth two-hit game in a row at 
Cleveland, including a single in the fourth inning that started a string of 
five singles after two were out. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jeff Shaw (2-2) got his second major league victory. His first was also 
against Texas. Shaw went 5 2/3 innings, giving up two runs and five hits. Doug 
Jones worked the ninth, getting his 29th save and giving up Harold Baines' 12th 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Milwaukee 2 -- Rookie Scott Erickson gave up five hits in seven 
innings at Minneapolis and Randy Bush had another home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins had lost four in a row and seven of their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is 17 for 44 since coming off a two-month stint on the disabled list July 
19. Since returning from a hamstring injury, he has four homers and nine runs 
batted in. He has raised his average from .206 to .277.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose was No. 14 on a baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
He is No. 01832061 here. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's all-time hit leader became a prisoner Wednesday when he entered a 
minimum-security camp next to the federal penitentiary to begin a five-month 
sentence for cheating on his income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who had until Friday to surrender, arranged beforehand to have a federal 
van pick him up in this Southern Illinois town and slipped unnoticed into the 
camp a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cincinnati Red manager arrived about noon and was accompanied by 
members of his family, Warden John L. Clark said. He did not specify which 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was fingerprinted, photographed and given his prison number before he 
joined his fellow inmates for dinner, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the prison would make a special effort to protect Rose, assigning 
him to a job that would be out of public view and respecting his request for no 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Guards have been prohibited from seeking Rose's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's release is scheduled for Jan. 7, 1991, prison officials said, and Rose 
said he hoped to be home for Christmas, with time off for good behavior. But 
assistant warden Randy Davis said Rose must serve three months at a halfway 
house in Cincinnati after he leaves Marion. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, banned from baseball a year ago for gambling, was convicted on two counts 
of filing false income tax returns. He failed to report more than $350,000 in 
income from gambling, autograph signing and memorabilia sales. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 49, was sentenced July 20 by U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in 
Cincinnati. He underwent knee surgery that day and delayed reporting to prison 
so he could recover. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Rose was not on crutches and that the knee was "doing well." He said 
his prison job could depend on how long Rose was able to stand and walk. 
</P>
<P>
As for Rose's demeanor, an associate who asked not to be identified said: "His 
attitude was, 'What do I have to do to get on with this?' It was like back to 
work, back to business." 
</P>
<P>
For the first two weeks, Rose will stay in a building apart from the main 
dormitory while he becomes oriented to prison life, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Camp inmates have been awaiting his arrival and said they hope he will play on 
their softball team. Rose also will have use of the camp's basketball, tennis, 
handball and boccie courts, and its weight room. 
</P>
<P>
The air-conditioned dormitory is surrounded by manicured lawns, with 
umbrella-shaded patio furniture, flower beds and a wildlife refuge. It is not 
fenced. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates sleep two to a cubicle and move freely around the main building.

METS HAVE AN ANSWER FOR PHILLIE STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Against left-handed pitching, the New York Mets are below .500 and Darryl 
Strawberry's average is below .230. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the Philadelphia Phillies took left-hander Don Carman out of 
the bullpen to start against the Mets Wednesday at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Carman was 5-0 in relief this season, but had not started since last September. 
He was no puzzle to the left-handed hitting Strawberry or his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry was two for three and drove in three runs to lead the Mets to an 8-4 
victory that ended their four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Carman (5-1) lasted four innings, giving up 10 hits and six runs, and is headed 
back to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets (61-45) improved their record against left-handers to 19-20 and ended 
a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Miller singled in the first inning and scored when Carman walked Gregg 
Jefferies with the bases loaded. Miller also singled in the second and scored 
on Jefferies' double. In the fourth, Miller singled to start another outburst 
as the Mets put together a 6-0 lead for David Cone (8-5). 
</P>
<P>
"We had been lethargic lately," Manager Bud Harrelson said. "Keith was the 
catalyst we needed. I planned on meeting with our hitters, but it was so late. 
Miller did the job for me. He woke up the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
There was other bad news for the Phillies. Ken Howell (8-7) has an aching 
shoulder and probably is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Pittsburgh 2 -- The Pirates, seeking pitching help for their first 
pennant run in 11 years, obtained left-hander Zane Smith from the Expos for 
three players, but Montreal won the ballgame at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos will get left-hander Scott Ruskin and two minor leaguers, shortstop 
Willie Greene and outfielder Moises Alou, the son of former major leaguer 
Felipe Alou, now the manager of the Expos' West Palm Beach farm club. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is unsigned and can become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the game, Tim Raines ended an 0-for-18 slump with two run-scoring doubles to 
end the Expos' six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek (14-5) had not lost since June 28, gave up all the runs and 10 hits 
in 6 2/3 innings, ending his six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 7, San Diego 1 -- Dave Justice is still celebrating winning a job as 
the Braves' starter in right field after the trade of Dale Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Justice hit two more home runs at Atlantato help John Smoltz improve his record 
to 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
Justice has hit five home runs in his last three games. He helped end a 
seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, St. Louis 3 -- The Cubs won in the 15th inning at Chicago when Andre 
Dawson hit a two-out single to score Joe Girardi from third. 
</P>
<P>
The game was scoreless until the 10th when the Cardinals scored twice. Chicago 
scored once and had a runner on third base with two out when Dwight Smith hit a 
grounder to third that Terry Pendleton, a former Gold Glove winner, fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Houston 4 -- The Giants mounted a 16-hit attack at Houston to 
end a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Litton's pinch double in the eighth inning drove in two runs, broke a tie 
and ended the Astros' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants open a four-game series at Cincinnati Friday night. DAN HAFNER

The woman whose involvement with Atlanta's archbishop led to his resignation 
says she was seduced by a nun when she was 19, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported. Two sources say Vicki R. Long, 27, claims she worked with the nun at 
a Columbus, Ga., hospital and was seduced on a trip to Pittsburgh, Pa., the 
paper said. Atlanta Roman Catholic Archdiocese officials have confirmed that 
former Archbishop Eugene A. Marino had an "intimate relationship" with Long, a 
former lay minister.

The man accused of being the "Dart Man" who fired homemade darts into women's

and prosecutors reduced felony charges against him to misdemeanors.

The decision by the Manhattan district attorney's office means Jerome Wright,

Mirrors being built for a $747-million series of weather satellites have been 
found to warp and become useless in the temperature extremes of space, a NASA 
official said. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman said 
that the flaw was discovered by ITT Aerospace, a subcontractor for the project, 
and that the planned weather satellites cannot be completed and launched until 
a solution is found. In another NASA project, a mirror aboard the Hubble Space 
Telescope is producing a blurred image.

Southern California residents attending September's Los Angeles Festival could 
be in for an exotic new experience: 
</P>
<P>
Riding the bus. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District approved an allocation of $150,000 to ensure 
that Angelenos can get to the Los Angeles Festival. For many denizens of 
car-crazed L.A., boarding a city bus might represent a bigger culture shock 
than attending a performance by aborigine spiritual dancers or the Kun Opera of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
But festival and transportation officials hope the 750,000 expected to attend 
the 17 days of festival events will help prevent traffic snarls and parking 
hassles at 70 widespread venues by taking public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
They also hope a good experience during the festival will entice passengers to 
commute by bus regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will allow municipal bus lines to extend beyond their usual 
boundaries, beef up the ranks of traffic control officers and engineers and 
provide traffic helicopters. Riders can already get computerized route 
information by calling (800) 2LA-RIDE. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bicker, Mayor Bradley's transportation adviser, said developing a 
transportation plan for Los Angeles Festival 1990 is more difficult than for 
the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival and the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, where most 
events were by paid attendance. Since 75% of the events at this year's festival 
are free, it's tougher to anticipate attendance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bicker said cities will determine which events might be particularly attractive 
to their residents and add bus lines accordingly. "For example, there are some 
ethnic groups (in specific neighborhoods) that might be attracted to particular 
events," Bicker said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to RTD buses and shuttles, UCLA's Fleet and Transit Service will be 
used to take the public and 500 international artists participating in the 
festival who will be living at UCLA's Artists Village to festival sites. 
</P>
<P>
A shuttle-bus service will be developed with $85,000 of the allocated funds to 
take festivalgoers from parking sites to major festival event areas, some of 
which have little or no parking space. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, "if you don't utilize the park-and-ride, you don't go to the 
festival," said Errol Talley, special events coordinator for the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point are the opening-day ceremonies, slated for Sept. 1 at San 
Pedro's Angel's Gate and nearby Point Fermin Park. There are only a few dozen 
parking spaces at the site, but between 60,000 and 100,000 people are expected 
to visit the site over the three-day Labor Day weekend. Signs will direct 
visitors to various large nearby parking sites and shuttles will take them to 
festival site areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bicker said no special transportation or parking will be provided for weekday 
events, which are predicted to draw crowds of less than 1,000.

MONTALBAN SUES OVER 'FANTASY ISLAND' SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Ricardo Montalban filed suit Tuesday against Columbia Pictures, claiming 
that the studio didn't pay him a promised 5% in profits from his "Fantasy 
Island" TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court suit, seeking $10 million in punitive damages in 
addition to the 5% in profits, claims that the 1977-1983 series earned more 
than $100 million and was one of the most successful in TV history. The suit 
charges that Columbia Pictures Television and Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. 
manipulated accounting practices to avoid paying Montalban a portion of the 
profits generated by the series. 
</P>
<P>
The studio denies that the show ever turned a profit.

GUERRILLA ARTIST ROBBIE CONAL STRIKES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
BILLBOARD: A HUGE SATIRICAL PORTRAIT OF NEA CRITIC SEN. JESSE HELMS IS UNVEILED 
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In North Carolina, where Sen. Jesse Helms is running for re-election, you can 
see the conservative Republican's face on highway billboards everywhere. But 
now the outspoken critic of the National Endowment for the Arts is getting top 
billing in Los Angeles too, thanks to guerrilla artist Robbie Conal, who 
unveiled a bigger-than-life satirical portrait of Helms Wednesday morning on a 
billboard in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of Jesse Helms as an icon of the conservative cultural brigade that's 
been on the move since the beginning of the Reagan Administration," said Conal, 
who has plastered city walls across America with biting political posters for 
the past several years. "He's an icon for the mean spirit that's sweeping the 
country. We in the arts community are just getting a dose of it now, but poor 
people -- and people of color -- have been suffering through it for the past 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The billboard portrait, which measures roughly 19 by 48 feet, superimposes 
Helms' visage on an artist's palette. The palette's thumb hole is centered in 
the middle of Helms' forehead, which is splattered with huge blobs of paint. By 
his head is the slogan: "Artificial Art Official." (The billboard is located on 
the north side of Santa Monica Boulevard, just west of La Cienega Boulevard.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never done a billboard before," said the 45-year-old artist, whose work 
will be featured in the upcoming Los Angeles Festival. "But its sheer size is a 
great weapon for an artist. In America, we read signs and images in a special 
way -- and we associate a huge public portrait with the Big Brother-style 
images of Stalin, Mussolini, Kadafi and (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"So I was taken by the idea of a stuffy old white man, with a hole in his head, 
looming large over West Hollywood and the artistic community that resides 
there. It perfectly captured the scary, totalitarian image I was aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
Conal, who rented the billboard space for three months, plans to change the 
title of the piece each month. In September, he says he'll replace the 
"Artificial Art Official" slogan with "Holy Homophobia." 
</P>
<P>
Conal acknowledged that if the billboard aroused controversy, he could lose the 
space prematurely. "The owners of the billboard (3M National) know what's going 
up -- and I was lucky that I found a sympathetic billboard broker who arranged 
everything for me. But who knows what'll happen, especially with the title 
changes?" 
</P>
<P>
Conal did the original Helms portrait in his studio, using oil paint on canvas. 
Then he had it adapted to billboard size -- and shape -- by painter Riley 
Forsythe. "He came to my studio to see the original," said Conal. "Then he did 
a huge translation of it, which is put together on six sections of plywood 
flats. The billboard painting company trucks them down to the site and puts it 
up with a crane." 
</P>
<P>
Conal wouldn't divulge how much the process costs; he considers it "simply part 
of my normal art-material expenses." He did admit that many friends urged him 
to put the billboard up in a more high-profile location like the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"I preferred West Hollywood, because I wanted to show solidarity with the gay 
community there," he said. "But I was also worried that if it went up on the 
Strip, people might think it was an ad for a Hollywood movie or a miniseries."

CANCELLATION OF 'MISS SAIGON' PLAYS AS A TRAGEDY; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE PROTEST AGAINST THE CASTING OF A NON-ASIAN IN THE LEAD ROLE WAS WELL 
INTENTIONED BUT UNSOUND.

<P>
When Actors' Equity denied permission for Jonathan Pryce to appear on Broadway 
as the Engineer, the Eurasian brothel-keeper in "Miss Saigon," it shot itself 
in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Cameron Mackintosh had vowed to cancel the production if he couldn't 
use Pryce. Wednesday, he made good on his promise. No Pryce, no show, no 
victors. 
</P>
<P>
Official tally: Fifty jobs lost that would have gone to American actors (34 of 
those members of minorities); jobs and revenue lost by other theatrical and 
artistic workers, and a $25-million advance ticket sale -- the largest on 
record -- to be refunded to the public, biggest loser of all. 
</P>
<P>
It would be less tragic if it had all gone for a principle worth upholding. But 
the reasons behind this fuss were fundamentally unsound. David Henry Hwang and 
B.D. Wong, the well-intentioned artists who initiated the protest against the 
casting of Pryce in "Miss Saigon," believed that they were striking a blow for 
minority actors. 
</P>
<P>
They were laying claim to a role they felt should be cast with an actor of 
Asian descent. But it would not necessarily have been correct to cast an 
Asian-American actor, any more than it was incorrect to have Pryce play it. To 
be faithful to the script, the Engineer would have to be played by an actor of 
mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage, as was explained in a letter to the Ethnic 
Minorities Committee of Actors' Equity by Velina Hasu Houston and Teresa Kay 
Williams, representing the Los Angeles-based Amerasian League. 
</P>
<P>
Houston and Williams pointed out that Pryce is at least half as right for the 
role as any "mono-racial" Asian-American actor might be. They went on to 
suggest that if no suitable mixed-blood Eurasian actor could be found to do it, 
then the role should go to an Asian actor (as opposed to an Asian-American 
one), "because in terms of culture," they argued, "an Asian actor would be 
closer to the psyche of the character." Barring that, they wrote, an 
Asian-American actor would be "the third best choice." 
</P>
<P>
This borders on discussions about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. 
Far from encouraging enlightened nontraditional casting, it accomplishes the 
reverse. It limits the vision. 
</P>
<P>
To insist that only a Eurasian should be cast in the Pryce role is at least as 
absurd as insisting that only Pryce can play it. Carried to its conclusion, 
such an argument is tantamount to insisting that only Russian actors should 
play Chekhov, British ones Shakespeare and French ones Moliere. And what does 
it make of the casting of Lea Salonga, a Filipina, in the leading "Saigon" role 
of the Vietnamese Kim? Such shortsightedness only diminishes the theater and 
everyone in it. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of satisfying Equity's own "import" stipulations, Pryce fully 
qualified as a star and certainly delivers a star turn in "Miss Saigon." It was 
an abdication of responsibility for Equity's executive secretary, Alan 
Eisenberg, to dismiss this consideration by saying that "Equity's position is 
that it cannot participate in this kind of casting decision." Even British 
Equity expressed its indignation at such reverse discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Surely Pryce is not the only person who can play the part of the Engineer, but 
it is easy to understand why the show's producer, Cameron Mackintosh, wanted to 
open the musical on Broadway with the best of his London cast and try to fully 
re-create its success -- a success contributed to in no small measure by Pryce. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Mackintosh was able, with far less ammunition, to persuade Equity 
to allow British performers Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman to open on 
Broadway in "The Phantom of the Opera." He later had no trouble casting an Afro 
American, Robert Guillaume, to succeed Crawford in the Phantom role in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Had Pryce been granted permission to come to Broadway, he would not have stayed 
forever. His role would then have gone to a Eurasian, Asian or Asian-American 
actor. Touring companies down the line would have featured actors acceptable to 
both Equity and Asian-Americans nationwide. Equity could have insisted on it as 
a condition of any deal it struck with Mackintosh. Equity could have insisted 
on a time limit for Pryce's appearance on Broadway. Equity could have gone 
after any arrangement it wanted, had it wanted one at all. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there was the possibility of taking the matter to arbitration. Equity 
virtually implored Mackintosh to do so, although well aware that he had already 
stated that he would not. In the best of all possible worlds, that would have 
been the best course. Mackintosh had an excellent chance of being vindicated, 
Equity would have saved face and negotiations could have forged ahead. But this 
is not the best of all possible worlds. And when pigheadedness set in, it set 
in on both sides of the table. 
</P>
<P>
The question of racial casting is not new and it won't go away. Entire 
symposiums have been devoted to examining and re-examining its permutations 
with an eye to encouraging multiracial and nontraditional casting. It's a hot 
potato, because everyone is afraid of offending everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
To blame Mackintosh for canceling the show, as Equity has, is to pass the buck. 
Equity's action played an unequivocal role in scuttling the production, and its 
intransigence on the issue smacked of artistic blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
No one can dispute the urgent need to expand opportunities for actors from all 
ethnic minorities. It is this ongoing tragedy that fomented the other. But the 
cancellation of "Miss Saigon" serves no one. There have been cases where the 
inappropriateness of cross-racial casting has been clear and compelling. This, 
unhappily for all concerned, was not one of them.

Recall attempt -- A story in the Aug. 2 edition of The Times incorrectly stated 
that organizers of a recall attempt against two trustees in the Inglewood 
Unified School District had withdrawn their effort. The story should have said

THE SENIOR CITIZEN BOOM; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: A CITY-FUNDED PROGRAM USES THE ELDERLY TO INSTALL SAFETY MEASURES IN 
SENIOR CITIZENS' RESIDENCES FREE OF CHARGE.

Celia Ross has had the yellow flyer about "Home Secure" in her Panorama City 
apartment for a long time. The flyer promises installation of grab bars in the 
shower, new dead bolts and a door viewer, all for free. She figured there must 
be a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, she looked for that flyer again. Ross' glaucoma treatment wasn't 
working, and she was going blind. Suddenly, it was hard to get around in the 
apartment where she has lived for 25 years, and she was afraid. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm legally blind now, I don't go out by myself anymore, but I can take care 
of myself," Ross said. "I'm just glad these people could help." 
</P>
<P>
Home Secure, funded by the cities of Los Angeles and West Hollywood, is unique 
among the country's elderly programs. The program has a team of elderly 
employees who install safety measures in homes and apartments of senior 
citizens (and low-income families) at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Since it began almost 10 years ago, the program -- administered by Jewish 
Family Services -- has opened an office in the San Fernando Valley, (818) 
762-5892), because almost half of its requests come from Valley residents, said 
Home Secure Director Leslie Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
To take care of Ross, Home Secure employee Lillian Siff interviewed her to 
assess her needs while Al Lynn, a retired schoolteacher, drilled holes to put 
grab bars in her bathroom and changed the dead bolt on her door. 
</P>
<P>
"The police recommend an inch-long dead bolt," Lynn said. "And we're giving you 
a mat so you won't slip in the shower, and a night light." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see too much anyway. At one time I could see well enough to do this 
work," Ross said, tugging on an intricate lace tablecloth she made. She has a 
large-numbered phone and on her sofa was a poster-size card from her 
granddaughter Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Siff explained some safety tips. "This is such a dangerous neighborhood now," 
Ross said. Siff also filled out a "Vial of Life" information card and stuck it 
on the outside of the refrigerator in case paramedics ever need to know what 
medications she is taking. 
</P>
<P>
The program also provides earthquake safety kits and makes homes less hazardous 
for people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Apartment managers 
must approve any work done, and the service is free to anyone earning less than 
$21,750 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' downstairs neighbor, Rose Klugman, 84, is faced with taking care of her 
husband, Alex, 83, recovering from prostate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoiled my husband," she said. "I've had this whole routine where I wash his 
hair in a bowl, then rub him down outside of the tub, then he steps in. I'm 
afraid to let him do it himself, though, he'll get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The Klugmans contacted Home Secure for help. The service installed mats and 
bars in the bathroom, so Alex could wash himself on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel so good now," Rose Klugman said when the work was done. "He 
doesn't hear well and I don't drive, so we don't go out very much. It's nice to 
feel secure in your own place." MICHAEL SZYMANSKI

Novel Curse 
</P>
<P>
Attorney-turned-author Chester Oksner, who lived in Sherman Oaks for 20 years 
before becoming a Maine-iac, is back in the Valley getting condolences from 
friends and former neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Since hanging up the law books, Oksner has been sailing around the Western 
world on his 46-foot ketch, the Tempest, building a home on five wooded, 
waterfront acres in Maine, and writing novels, the first being a critically 
well-received courtroom drama called, "Punitive Damage." His second effort, out 
now, is "Burdens of Proof," and -- like his first book -- it is a riveting 
story about greed, deception, discovery, love, hate and all the delicious stuff 
of which best sellers are made. 
</P>
<P>
This book, however, is not a best seller. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the main thing, it has almost the same title as Scott Turow's 
"The Burden of Proof," and that is the thorn in Oksner's side. 
</P>
<P>
Oksner said it was not that he begrudged Turow his just rewards. Writing books, 
after all, is a difficult business, and Oksner wishes his fellow 
attorney-author well. 
</P>
<P>
That's not what bothers Oksner. 
</P>
<P>
The maddeningly bothersome thing is the barrage of repetitive questions people 
ask Oksner about the other book. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that there's another book out that has almost the same title as 
yours? 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that Scott Turow is a lawyer, too? 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that Scott Turow has been on the cover of Time magazine? 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that Scott Turow is raking it in hand over fist? 
</P>
<P>
Oksner is bemused by the questions, but undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bookstore Groupies 
</P>
<P>
Any time is a good time to go to the bookstore, but summer is sometimes better 
than good, if Dutton's New, Old and Rare Books and Prints in North Hollywood is 
any indication. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton's is never going to win any neatness awards. There are books on tables, 
books on chairs, books in alcoves and books stacked on top of the books in all 
these places. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to John Patterson, a young man who calls himself a regular, 
Dutton's is nirvana for those looking to come in out of the summer heat and 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
He said kids go to camp, teen-agers go to the beach, Valley girls of all ages 
go to the mall and the literate go to a nice, cool bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said using Dutton's as an oasis can get expensive. 
</P>
<P>
He comes in expecting to just enjoy the air-conditioning, the baroque music 
wafting over the stereo, the other bookies who strike up conversations, and to 
browse. But, like the guy trying to exercise self-control in a pickup bar, he 
falls in love with some hard covers he was just intending to skim, and ends up 
taking them home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patriot of the Galleria 
</P>
<P>
Judy Kory is hanging out in the Sherman Oaks Galleria just like a Valley girl, 
although she's really a grown-up, not a teen-ager, and she's from West 
Hollywood not, like, Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Kory has time to hang around the mall because she isn't doing her usual summer 
job, which is playing the lord mayor's wife at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire. 
At least, that's what she did when it was out in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the fair has moved to San Bernardino, she's into something else. 
Registering voters. 
</P>
<P>
She said going up to people in the mall takes all of her thespian skills and 
her psychological know-how. Sometimes people are rude, just on general 
principles, assuming she is trying to sell them something. Other times they 
want to sit and talk because they are lonely. 
</P>
<P>
She said the job isn't a big income maker -- she makes close to minimum wage -- 
but it does give her a chance to feel as though she's doing something 
important. After the November election, she's going back to her real job as an 
environmental theater consultant, which means she takes plays about the 
environment into school classrooms.

Scoping It Out 
</P>
<P>
While the "Tonight Show" is on, there's a good chance Johnny Carson is star 
gazing in Malibu with his $4,000 telescope that he bought from a store in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Parks Optical just opened a new branch on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, 
and if you think watching heavenly stars means scoping the skies, not Spago, 
you might like to check it out. 
</P>
<P>
For $23,000 you can buy a 16-inch telescope that gives you a good look at deep 
space and is used by Northrop, Hughes, TRW and Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
For $4,000 you can imitate Carson, king of the night, by purchasing a designer 
brass and wood Harbormaster telescope. 
</P>
<P>
For about $500 you can buy a do-it-yourself telescope kit. 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, just before the new moon, the clients of the store go as a group 
to Mt. Pinos, where they join astronomy buffs from around Southern California 
in setting up telescopes for optimum star gazing. Even if you don't have a 
telescope, you can join the excursion, and sneak peaks through the telescopes 
of others. For information about the next trip, Aug. 18, call (818) 789-5805.

BARGAINS: DON'T TOSS THAT OLD SOFA OUT YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At one time or another, every furniture-owner faces the dilemma of "should we 
buy new or reupholster the old piece?" 
</P>
<P>
Buying new might seem less costly, but a well-made sofa or chair or a prized 
antique might be worth reupholstering. But with labor costs so high, the only 
way to make it pay off is to save money on the fabric. The Foam Mart in Burbank 
is one source for great deals on quality fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
For 26 years, the Foam Mart has been buying close-outs and discontinued 
upholstery fabrics from major mills and selling them at liquidation prices. 
Plan on saving half on the original retail price. These might not be the latest 
patterns or designs, but creations of recent years can be more appealing than 
those fresh from the mills. 
</P>
<P>
A splendid and ageless Italian tapestry from Barston Mills that lists for $60 
is $29.95. It would make a great footstool, chair or wall-hanging. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes fabrics are discounted more than 50%. One particular cotton print I 
loved and had priced at another discounter for $12.50 was tagged $4.89. 
</P>
<P>
A good inventory of Southwest pastels by ChristTone, a local manufacturer, 
takes up one section of the 8,000-square-foot warehouse. One stunner was 
$18.50, discounted from $37.50. 
</P>
<P>
An array of vinyls for around $10 a yard could cover every RV in the San 
Fernando Valley, and 60-inch-wide duck canvas that retails for $16 to $20 has 
an everyday price of $9.75. The animal activists will like the selection of 
fake furs from the Mauldon Mills; one diamond design white "mink" was $17.99, 
again half the regular $35 price. 
</P>
<P>
Some designer fabrics with names such as Schumacher/Waverly and Westgate grace 
the shelves in this bare-bones warehouse. The only drawback is that the yardage 
in some patterns is limited to 20 or 30 yards and in most cases cannot be 
reordered. 
</P>
<P>
If you have the talent for reupholstering, the Foam Mart has a complete 
selection of equipment and materials -- needles, thread, webbing, cambric and 
Velcro by the yard. The Foam Mart will do custom upholstery, cushions for 
boats, window seats, etc., at better than competitive prices: $450 for a 
standard seven-foot sofa, for example, $250 for a standard wing chair. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's foam in just about every density made. They'll cut it 
into any shape you need. Service is paramount, and if you need to fill some 
pillows, bring them in, buy the foam and experts will stuff them free. 
</P>
<P>
The Foam Mart is at 628 N. Victory Blvd., Burbank, (818) 848-3626. It is open 
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. MasterCard and Visa are 
accepted.

'ROSES' A SUCCESS IN RENTAL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

international news services and the nation's press.

<P>
A box-office smash, "The War of the Roses," featuring Kathleen Turner and 
Michael Douglas as a couple locked in marital combat, proved there's a mass 
audience for black comedy. Its theatrical success has extended to the rental 
market, where "Roses" moved up one notch to the top of the Billboard magazine 
rental chart. 
</P>
<P>
Modest-grossing "Family Business," which didn't figure to be a big rental hit, 
continues to be propelled by the surprisingly potent star power of Sean 
Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick. "Business" moved up three places 
to No. 6. "Hard to Kill," featuring action hero Steven Seagal as a vengeful cop 
with nine lives, debuted at an impressive No. 7 and could crack the Top Five 
next week. "Blaze," starring Paul Newman as a politician having an affair with 
a stripper, entered the chart at No. 16. "Enemies, a Love Story" came on the 
chart at No. 34. 
</P>
<P>
* "Driving Miss Daisy" debuted at No. 30, but could be the most popular rental 
of the next few weeks. This warmhearted comedy/drama, which raked in more than 
$102 million at the box-office, boasts best-picture and best-actress (Jessica 
Tandy) Oscars -- making it a veritable shoo-in to reach the top of the rental 
chart.

4 TEEN-AGERS ARRESTED IN STANTON DRIVE-BY SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A team of 42 law enforcement officials raided four locations in Orange County 
this morning and arrested two teen-agers in connection with a fatal drive-by 
shooting of a 16-year-old Stanton youth last month. 
</P>
<P>
Two other youths who were already in custody for an unrelated incident were 
also charged this morning with the drive-by slaying of Johnny Casillas Jr. on 
July 21. Casillas was shot while walking at night to his grandmother's house in 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
The 9:45 a.m. raids took place at two locations in Garden Grove and two 
locations in the unincorporated area of Anaheim. They were conducted by the 
Sheriff's Department's gang-prevention unit, probation officers and juvenile 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said that Casillas may have been the victim of a random 
shooting by gang members but that there is no evidence that he himself was in a 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Stanton gang and its rivals, Colonia Independencia, whose members live 
in the unincorporated Anaheim area, have stepped up their longstanding feud 
since the March shooting death of Rosendo Ibarra, 17. Family members say Ibarra 
was associated with Colonia Independencia. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested during the raids today included a 15-year-old from Garden Grove 
and a 15-year-old from Anaheim, said Lt. Richard Olson, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman. Their identities were withheld because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
The two already in custody and charged in the Casillas shooting today were a 
15-year-old from Anaheim and a 14-year-old from Garden Grove. Both have been in 
custody since July 26, when they were arrested on concealed-weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the arrests were made after police found an abandoned late-model red 
Nissan Sentra believed to have been used in the drive-by shooting of Casillas. 
The car, found in Stanton a few hours after Casillas was shot, contained 
evidence that linked at least three of the juveniles to the shooting, Olson 
said.

Heavily armed police in armored vehicles today tried to restore order in the 
southeastern city of Port Elizabeth after 23 people were reported killed in a 
night of rioting and looting. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rioters stormed through Port Elizabeth on Wednesday night, looting 
and attacking bystanders, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminal mobs ran amok . . . looting and burning shops at random and causing 
damage. . . . A baby was shot dead in its mother's lap," said local journalist 
Cliff Foster. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting began Monday over a political dispute, but police said criminals 
had taken advantage of the confusion to start looting. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Major Bill Dennis said 18 people were killed by gunfire, but 
he did not have figures on how many of them were killed by police. Police 
repeatedly opened fire with shotguns and pistols to disperse the mob. 
</P>
<P>
The rioters, who surged through parts of Port Elizabeth and surrounding 
townships, destroyed and burned 23 shops, six houses, two factories, one church 
and three schools, Dennis said.

A suspect in a stabbing was arrested this morning after a three-hour standoff 
with Los Angeles police that ended when tear gas was shot into his North 
Hollywood apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilber Weatherly, 47, surrendered about 3:30 a.m. after a special weapons and 
tactics team fired a tear gas canister into a second-floor apartment along the 
11500 block of Magnolia Boulevard, Lt. Stuart Maislin said. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherly, who was treated for exposure to tear gas, was arrested on suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon and was being held without bail at County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Maislin said a man whose identity was not released told officers he had been in 
Weatherly's apartment when Weatherly stabbed him during an argument shortly 
after midnight. The man ran out of the apartment and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where he 
was treated for a superficial chest wound, Maislin said.

In a dramatic response to Iraqi threats, Israel today launched the first test 
of the U.S.-financed Arrow missile that is being developed to combat 
short-range ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said the missile was launched at 3:40 p.m. at an undisclosed 
location. 
</P>
<P>
It left a short trail of fire and a small ring of smoke, said a radio reporter. 
</P>

The radio report said the launch was a direct response to Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein's threat on Wednesday to launch a missile attack on Israel. 
Saddam made the threat after alleging that Israeli warplanes had been painted 
with American colors in preparation for an attack on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Today's missile launching was attended by officials from Israel Aircraft 
Industries, which is developing the Arrow, and by American representatives, the 
report said.

Washington provided 80% of the $158-million cost of the first phase of the

Two cosmonauts whose mission was plagued by technical problems and a perilous 
spacewalk returned to Earth today with a multimillion-ruble payload of 
space-grown crystals. 
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin landed 
on the Central Asian steppes at 11:34 a.m., one minute ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The landing was not broadcast live on Soviet television. But the midday 
"Vremya" TV news program showed the cosmonauts waving goodby to their 
replacement crew before leaving the orbiting space station Mir. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the landing spaceship, we felt the slightly bitter smell of absinthe 
in the Kazakh steppe," Solovyev told reporters after landing and ending his 
six-month stay in space. "I also dreamed that my wife would bring me fresh, 
delicious apples when I was back on Earth," he said.

VAST FISH KILL DRENCHES MAINE TOWN IN STENCH

Residents kept their windows shut and an inn was closed as the stench from 
thousands of rotting fish filled the air today. 
</P>
<P>
In the waters of Quahog Bay, Maine's latest menhaden kill has suffocated 
thousands of lobsters, crabs, snails and other sea life. 
</P>
<P>
"The eels are even dead -- and they're hard to kill," said Linda Webber, who 
owns Webber and Sons Lobster Co. with her husband in this seacoast town of 
2,500. She said the company has lost about $10,000 in lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Waddle, owner of Quahog Lobster Inc., the other lobster dealer at Quahog 
Bay, said he has lost at least that much. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall loss is tremendous. Not just my loss, but everyone's loss, because 
everything in the bay's been killed," Waddle said. 
</P>
<P>
Vast schools of menhaden, or pogies, first were chased into Quahog Bay by 
feeding bluefish about a month ago, Waddle said. The schools severely depleted 
the oxygen in the water, killing lobsters and other aquatic life. 
</P>
<P>
Pogies are oily fish that can weigh up to two pounds and are used for lobster 
bait, fertilizer and cat food. 
</P>
<P>
Dead pogies can be seen floating in clumps throughout the cove and are caked 
onto rocks along the shore. 
</P>
<P>
The smell is so bad that a bed-and-breakfast on the bay closed. The inn's owner 
said he and his wife will not reopen until the odor is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Fish kills have happened along Maine's coast several times in recent years, but 
"this is certainly a large die-off," said Marshall Murphy, spokesman for the 
state Department of Marine Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the state will not attempt a cleanup in Quahog Bay. He said past 
cleanups have proved to be "very expensive and less than totally successful."

HUBBLE TELESCOPE FLAW BLAMED ON FAULTY MANUFACTURING TOOL

The defect that blurred the Hubble space telescope's view of the heavens may 
have been caused by a flaw in an instrument used to measure the observatory's 
mirror when it was built, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of tests conducted on a device called a "null corrector" 
found spacings in the instrument were about 1 millimeter off from design 
specifications, according to a statement from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The reflective null corrector is an optical reference device, which was used 
to measure very precisely the surface figure of the (telescope's) primary 
mirror during its manufacture" in 1981, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The device was found in the factory in Danbury, Conn., where the mirror was 
built, by a NASA investigative panel led by Lew Allen of the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, which ordered the tests. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past two weeks tests have been run, systematically checking various 
aspects of this device," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary results of a test conducted . . . (Wednesday) to look at the 
spacings of the elements in the corrector have revealed a clear discrepancy of 
approximately 1 millimeter between the design of the null corrector and the 
device as it now exists," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
One millimeter is about 1/25 of an inch, or about the diameter of the point of 
a ball-point pen. 
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary analysis indicates that a discrepancy of this magnitude could 
cause spherical aberration similar to that observed in the (telescope's) 
primary mirror," it said.

BP, the Cleveland-based subsidiary of British Petroleum and the ninth-largest

No. 11 Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said it is cutting prices at 
some of its gasoline terminals by as much as 4.5 cents due to market changes.

Growing pessimism over the Middle East set stock prices nose-diving in Tokyo 
today, while share prices finished modestly higher on London's Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 893.41 points, or 3.13%, ending at 
27,615.73, its lowest level since Oct. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshio Ogawa, chief trader at Nikko Securities, said investors shied away from 
the market because they are increasingly pessimistic about the Middle East 
conflict, which they believe will be prolonged. 
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 7.4 points, or 
0.3%, to close at 2,244.9. 
</P>
<P>
British investors appeared tired from the week's erratic trading and uncertain 
over the market's near-term direction, preferring to take to the sidelines 
until a clearer trend could be discerned, dealers said.

Lower oil prices in the first half of 1990 bit sharply into Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group's profits, slicing net income by 40%, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in crude oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a week ago 
is not reflected in Shell's latest figures but is expected to influence results 
for the full year. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were weak in much of the first six months of the year because OPEC 
overproduction glutted the market. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the first six months of 1990 fell to $2.59 billion from $4.29 
billion in the same 1989 period. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the full year is obviously extremely uncertain and almost 
entirely dependent on how events in the Middle East unfold," Shell said.

Revenue for the quarter slipped 3.3% to $2.95 billion from $3.06 billion a year 
earlier.

"Higher margins in our coffee and grocery operations combined with a continued 
strong profit . . . in our personal products businesses more than offset lower

RETAILERS POST AN AVERAGE 5.7% JULY SALES GAIN

<P>
The nation's big retailers today posted an average 5.7% gain in July, but the 
sales growth failed to impress analysts, who expect increasingly tight times in 
the retailing industry for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Promotions to move out summer merchandise gave most of the boost to business. 
</P>
<P>
An index of 17 leading chains compiled by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. indicated 
that sales rose 5.7% in July from a year earlier, little different from June's 
5.8% year-to-year gain. 
</P>
<P>
Several nationwide general merchandisers posted results that fell short of the 
industry average. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Sears, Roebuck and Co. said its sales in the four weeks ended Aug. 4 rose 
3.7% from a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year moved 3.1% 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Same-store results are widely regarded as the best indicator of a retailer's 
performance. Tallies that include new stores can be inflated because business 
frequently is busier immediately after an opening than it ends up being over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Second-ranked K mart Corp. reported its July sales rose 12.1%. But on a 
comparable store basis, sales grew a more modest 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
One of the standouts, as usual, was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which posted a 21% 
increase in July. Its same-store sales grew 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Several specialty apparel retailers also outperformed the industry. The Gap 
Inc., for instance, said its July sales jumped 36%. Sales at stores open a year 
or longer rose 28%. 
</P>
<P>
J. C. Penney Co. said its July sales rose 3.2%. Same-store sales grew 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton Hudson Corp. said its sales grew 16.4%, while same-store sales were up 
4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
May Department Stores Co. said its sales grew 9.8%. Comparable store sales rose 
4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. said its sales grew 19% to $348.9 
million.

In a move that could further drive up the price of diesel fuel but that 
promises to virtually eliminate the belching black smoke from diesel engines, 
the Environmental Protection Agency today ordered an 80% cut in the sulfur in 
the fuel over three years. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule will add between 1.8 cents and 2.3 cents per gallon to the cost of 
the fuel, heavily used within the transportation industry as a fuel for trucks, 
buses and locomotives. Some passenger cars also have diesel engines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the price of the fuel will go up, the EPA also said the prospect of 
lessened engine wear and cheaper emissions controls could offset some or all of 
the higher per-gallon price.

A conservative religious group that cropped pictures of an artist's work to 
suggest that it was sexually explicit has been ordered by a federal judge to 
distribute a correction to the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
The American Family Assn. of Tupelo, Miss., had reprinted fragments of images 
by David A. Wojnarowicz to promote the organization's contention that the 
National Endowment for the Arts supports pornography. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William C. Conner came in a lawsuit 
by Wojnarowicz. The judge said the pamphlet had probably harmed the artist's 
professional and personal reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Conner barred further publication of the pamphlet, "Your Tax Dollars Helped Pay 
for These Works of Arts." 
</P>
<P>
He also awarded $1 in damages to Wojnarowicz, who had sought up to $1 million. 
He said Wojnarowicz had not proved financial damage because no galleries or 
museums had canceled exhibits of his work. 
</P>
<P>
Conner said the American Family Assn. must send a court-approved correction to 
the 4,000 churches, members of Congress and other individuals who received the 
pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
The association and its executive director, the Rev. Donald Wildmon, have for 
years led campaigns against films, music, TV shows, magazines and art that they 
deem obscene.

Playboy can sell only two of four posters based on drawings Keith Haring had 
done for the magazine, and it must tell buyers they were not authorized by the 
late pop artist, according to an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Haring's estate filed suit in June in U.S. District Court in Manhattan against 
Playboy Enterprises Inc., claiming copyright infringement and deceptive trade 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The posters were being sold along with "certificates of authenticity" for up to 
$600, said Peter Stern, attorney for the Keith Haring Foundation. The posters 
are worth only about $5, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The estate also claimed that three of the four drawings had been "colorized," 
at least one was altered and Haring's signature was added to two of them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, Chicago-based Playboy agreed to recall and cease 
marketing two of the posters, Stern said.

"I want my MTV royalties," says a 39-year-old man who claims in a federal 
lawsuit that the music television network stole his copyrighted idea for a rock 
'n' roll game show. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Winik, who runs a printing supply company, is suing MTV and its parent 
company, Viacom Inc., over the network's 3-year-old game show "Remote Control" 
and a show that debuted this year called "Turn It Up." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed this week in U.S. District Court, contends that Winik 
developed an idea in 1985 for a game show called "Rockout." He copyrighted the 
concept and tried to sell it to MTV in 1986, but the music network rejected his 
proposal, the suit said.

the White House, I would not have been able to seek proper help." 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis, who acknowledges her drug and alcohol addiction, says she panicked 
before the New Hampshire primary in 1988 when she realized her husband could 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael was good enough to be President, for sure, but was I worthy to be his 
partner? In my despair, I turned to alcohol," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis tells of periods of heavy drinking during the campaign and after her 
husband's loss to George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
She says she began a typical day at 9 a.m. by canceling her appointments and 
downing three or four ounces of straight liquor. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I'd go upstairs, shut the blinds, unplug the phone and read till I passed 
out -- a process that usually took no more than 10 minutes. Two and a half 
hours later, I would wake up and repeat the process," she said.

BARDOT URGES CHIMP'S RETURN

Brigitte Bardot is demanding that Japan return a chimpanzee that a French zoo 
traded to a Japanese research institute for 10 monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
The former film star said during a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Akitani 
Kiuchi that the 10-year-old chimpanzee named Chloe was living "worse than 
badly, in a frozen universe" at the University of Kyoto's Primate Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Chloe was traded along with an orangutan by the Zoo de Vincennes in Paris for 
10 macaque monkeys in 1984. The orangutan died earlier this year in a concrete 
cage, Bardot's Society for the Protection of Animals claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"Chloe is in a basement, lacking sunlight, space, contact and especially lacks 
affection, like all laboratory subjects," it said in a statement. The type of 
research was not specified. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will investigate Bardot's claims, a spokesman said. But 
he noted that the animal trade was made between private institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Bardot, 55, who rose to world fame in the 1956 movie "And God Created Women," 
gave up her film career in 1973 and has since worked to protect animals.

LIZ SMITH: POITIER, LANCASTER TEAM UP FOR ABC MINISERIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SIDNEY POITIER and Burt Lancaster, two great Oscar-winning movie stars, will 
join forces and appear together for the first time on television in ABC's 
miniseries "Separate but Equal." 
</P>
<P>
Poitier portrays Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Lancaster appears as 
John W. Davis, Marshall's chief opponent in the historic civil rights case 
known as Brown vs. the Board of Education. Marshall was counsel for the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund and led the fight to end school segregation in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
So who persuaded these two super-actors to pool their talents for this 
small-screen blockbuster? George Stevens Jr., that's who. Stevens, a talented 
man, is to television what his father was to movies. He will direct and produce 
"Separate but Equal." 
</P>
<P>
Shooting on the ambitious project began early this week in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T MISS the Aug. 12 issue of Parade magazine and writer Ed Klein's incisive, 
candid interview with former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In this piece, Reagan defends his oft-criticized wife Nancy: "Our marriage is 
the kind of thing that an adolescent believes marriage should be. . . . I don't 
think either one of us thinks of making a big decision without the other." 
Reagan says that even he was shocked by the controversial $2-million fee he 
received for a speaking engagement in Japan but insists he was not "cashing in 
on the presidency. . . . If I'd been of a nature to cash in, I would have 
returned to the industry that I left." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan readily admits to having enjoyed being President, though he often felt 
trapped and confined because of all the security measures, "like a bird in a 
gilded cage." Still, if Reagan could have had his way, he would have lingered a 
while longer in that cage. He wanted very much to run again in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 22nd Amendment, limiting a President to two terms in office, ended his 
reign. The 40th President of the United States declares emphatically: "That 
amendment is an infringement on the democratic right of the people. The people 
have a right to vote for whomever they want and for as many times as they 
want!" 
</P>
<P>
NOW HERE is a bit of amusing movie trivia. All you "Casablanca" fanatics out 
there already know that young actor Reagan was once briefly considered to play 
the bitter cafe owner Rick in that famous film. But were you aware that Dooley 
Wilson was not the first choice as Rick's piano player? 
</P>
<P>
No, originally, the producer, Hal Wallis, considered either Hazel Scott or Lena 
Horne for the part. When the legend that is Lena was recently told about this, 
she laughed and said, "Well, I guess they would have had to change that line to 
'Play it again, Mandy.' "

Lakers star Magic Johnson has withdrawn from consideration as a candidate for 
the board of trustees at Michigan State University, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who played for the 1979 NCAA champion Spartans, told those encouraging 
him to run as a Democrat that he wanted to wait until after his playing career 
ends, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Darwin Payton said Johnson was very excited about being considered 
for the position. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he just came up with the decision this week," Payton said. "He wants 
to wait until the end of his NBA career." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was being urged to run for the seat being vacated by Michigan State 
trustee Malcolm Dade, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Major party candidates for the Michigan State board are selected at the party 
conventions this year.

BEN JOHNSON TO RUN AGAIN FOR CANADA;

<P>
DRUGS: THE GOVERNMENT REVERSES ITS LIFETIME BAN ON THE SPRINTER FOR USING 
STEROIDS AT SEOUL OLYMPICS.

Sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his world's fastest-human title and was kicked 
out of the 1988 Olympics for using steroids, was given government clearance 
today to run again for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Sports Minister Marcel Danis reversed the ruling of his predecessor, 
Jean Charest, who in 1988 placed Johnson under a lifetime ban from competing 
for the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the president of Athletics Canada said Johnson will be 
reinstated to a national team after his two-year suspension by track and 
field's international governing body expires Sept. 24 -- if the sprinter can 
meet team standards. 
</P>
<P>
Though Johnson will be able to compete again, he and any other Canadian athlete 
caught using performance-enhancing drugs face lifetime bans on receiving direct 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
In making his announcement, Danis warned that athletes caught using banned 
drugs in the future will face even stiffer penalties. He proposed that the 
suspension for a first-time offense be doubled, from two years to four. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the notion . . . that anti-doping rules ought not put the federal 
government in the position of deciding day-to-day matters relating to the 
eligibility of individual athletes, coaches, trainers and others," the sports 
minister said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of his gold medal and world record for the 100-meter dash 
at the Seoul Olympics after testing positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just very happy that the government gave me the OK to run for this country 
again," Johnson said in the driveway at his family home in east suburban 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank the Canadian public who supported me. This is one of the 
happiest days of my life, so far. I am very, very happy that I can run for this 
country again."

CHEST PAINS PUT BRONCOS' COACH REEVES IN HOSPITAL

Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves has been hospitalized after he suffered chest 
pains Wednesday night, his daughter said today. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the hospital to which Reeves was admitted was not known. Denver 
Broncos officials declined to reveal Reeves' location. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves is in good condition, Laura Reeves said. Her father was initially taken 
to North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley when the problem occurred about 6 
p.m. Wednesday. She said the family believes Reeves can receive better care in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
At a hastily called news conference at the Broncos training camp here, Dr. 
Randall Marsh confirmed that Reeves had suffered chest pains, but not a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, he is just fine. We have discovered blockages in arteries 
supplying blood to the heart," Marsh, a cardiologist at North Colorado Medical 
Center, said. 
</P>
<P>
The medical term for Reeves' ailment is atherosclerosis, a form of 
arteriosclerosis, said Garrett Mudd, a Broncos spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves is expected to remain hospitalized for four to five days, and has been 
advised to take three to four weeks off, Marsh said. Reeves will have the 
problem treated immediately, with the focus on avoiding surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The cardiologist said that he does not expect the problem to harm Reeves' 
career and that there will be no restrictions when he returns to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about him," the doctor said. "He has had a rude awakening by 
Mother Nature." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka, a longtime friend of Reeves who suffered a 
heart attack in November, 1988, said Reeves had all the symptoms of a heart 
attack, "but he was smart enough -- which I wasn't when I had mine -- to 
recognize what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
During Reeves' absence, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has been named 
interim coach, Mudd said. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, 46, took over the Broncos in 1981 and is in his 10th season with the 
team. He has led the team to three Super Bowl seasons in the past four years.

<P>
John Henry, one of the most beloved horses of all time, and his trainer Ron 
McAnally entered the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame this morning along with 
jockey Jorge Velasquez, trainer Jonathan Sheppard and three champion horses. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally credited "a lot of good owners" who "put up money for a lot of good 
horses" to enable him to reach the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in racing, you have many dreams . . . and, of course, my dream 
came true with having a horse of this caliber," McAnally said of John Henry. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Horse of the Year raced until the age of 9 before being retired in 
1985. He was bought for $25,000 sight unseen by Sam Rubin, who today accepted 
John Henry's plaque that will hang in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, winner of more than 6,000 races, thanked Fred Hooper, who brought 
the Panama native to ride in the United States in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to be here, and I'm also very nervous," said Velasquez, who was 
dressed in a gray tuxedo. "But the day has arrived, and I'm tickled to death." 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard, considered one of the greatest trainers ever of steeplechase racers, 
said he was honored to join a select group "who represent a tiny percent of the 
profession." 
</P>
<P>
Also inducted were the French filly All Along, Bimelech and Zaccio. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies, held in a large tent aside the National Museum of Racing, was 
attended by an overflow crowd of about 1,500, including 35 Hall of Famers 
reunited for the day. Among those on hand today were jockeys Bill Shoemaker, 
Eddie Arcaro, Ted Atkinson, Angel Cordero Jr. and Chris McCarron and trainers 
Buddy Hirsch, Leroy Jolley, John Nerud, Angel Penna and Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion, the largest gathering of racing Hall of Famers ever, is part of 
the museum's 40th anniversary celebration. Today's events included a trackside 
breakfast with Hall of Famers, hosted by actor John Forsythe, followed by the 
induction ceremonies, with jockey-turned-mystery-writer Dick Francis serving as 
guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry was 1984 Horse of the Year and retired the next year with career 
earnings of $6,597,947, a record until broken by Alysheba in 1988. John Henry 
won 39 of 83 starts, with 15 seconds and nine thirds. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has trained 89 stakes winners in his 30-year career. The 57-year-old 
Kentuckian saddled such stakes winners as Bayakoa, Hawkster, Warning Zone and 
Super Moment. 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard has been the leading money-winner among steeplechase trainers in the 
United States for the past 17 years. The 49-year-old Briton has trained six 
national steeplechase champions, including Flatterer, winner of the 1983 
steeplechase Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, 43, was the nation's leading rider in 1967 with 438 winners and set 
a record by riding 57 stakes winners in 1985. Among his winning rides were 
Pleasant Colony in the 1981 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
All Along, a French-bred filly voted Horse of the Year in 1983, won more than 
$3 million in her career. As a 4-year-old that year she won France's Arc de 
Triomphe, Woodbine's Rothmans International, Belmont's Turf Classic and the 
Washington, D.C., International at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
Bimelech was champion 2-year-old in 1939 and champion 3-year-old in 1940, when 
he won the Preakness and Belmont after being upset by Gallahadion in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Zaccio captured steeplechase championship honors from 1980 to '82. 
</P>
<P>
The inductees were elected earlier this year by a national panel of 100 racing 
writers.

TRAINER LUKAS HAS REDEFINED HIMSELF -- AND HIS PROFESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since he began his meteoric rise in the thoroughbred business, Wayne Lukas has 
been the trainer everybody loves to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Many rival horsemen have looked at him with a contempt that is surely mixed 
with jealousy. Neutral observers say that the reason he annually leads the 
nation in purse winnings is that he has more good horses and more money behind 
him than anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Lukas, in the space of a decade, has shattered records that Woody 
Stephens and Charlie Whittingham needed more than 50 years to compile, his name 
is rarely mentioned in the same breath with those icons of his profession. 
Although Lukas obviously is a savvy businessman, he rarely is extolled as a 
great horseman. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that he often has seemed obsessed by getting fast, immediate 
results with young horses -- and burning them out in the process. He pushed 
such ill-prepared horses as Capote and Houston into the Kentucky Derby, and 
they were never the same afterward. The three horses he won Triple Crown events 
with -- Codex, Tank's Prospect and Winning Colors -- never won a race of 
consequence thereafter. His color bearers were often finished at a stage of 
their careers when Whittingham horses were just beginning to develop and 
mature. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who have cited this argument as the principal indictment of 
Lukas' training skills, the identities of America's leading racehorses of 1990 
come as a bit of a surprise. The top-ranked horse is Criminal Type, who has 
just begun to blossom at age 5 and has won four straight Grade I stakes. The 
top turf horse is Steinlen, who earned the Eclipse Award last year and is going 
strong at age 7. Both are trained by Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
It may be time for his detractors to re-evaluate Wayne Lukas. Has he changed 
and matured as a trainer? 
</P>
<P>
He says no: "I don't think we've made any changes; this is the same program 
we've always had. I just think we're wearing down the critics. The most 
difficult thing to do in horse racing is to be consistent. This game is full of 
guys who have up years and down years. We've been consistent for nine years." 
Indeed, this will be the eighth straight year in which his stable has led the 
nation in winnings. 
</P>
<P>
What has changed during that period, he said, is the type of results he has 
sought. It was no accident that he made his first success with precocious 
2-year-olds; the Steinlens came later. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't have an established program, and you get new players, you have 
to show them some action," he said. "They can say over and over again, 'I'm a 
patient person, I want to build a program,' but that's baloney. You couldn't 
tell Gene Klein that you wanted to buy some grass horses that would be good 
when they were 3 or 4. He wanted action!" 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has established himself and built ongoing programs with his big 
clients, Lukas said, he can afford to take his time. He is waiting later and 
later to turn loose his best prospects; he's taking a longer view. He still 
seems to succumb to impatience and wishful thinking at the time of the Kentucky 
Derby, but otherwise, his image as a trainer obsessed with instant results is 
passe. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he is proving that his great strength is his long-range vision. He 
entered the thoroughbred game with a concept of an operation that challenged 
the traditional notions of training. His critics could focus on his more 
blatant mistakes (the Capotes, the Houstons) and use them to deride the whole 
concept. But as these criticisms fade, it is becoming increasingly clear that 
Lukas' program has revolutionized his profession. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is hardly revolutionary for a trainer to cultivate large numbers 
of wealthy owners and assemble large numbers of high-class horses. But every 
American trainer who has done so in the past has run a regional business. Woody 
Stephens is a New York trainer. Charlie Whittingham is a California trainer. 
They would, of course, ship their horses out of town for major stakes, but they 
had a single base of operations. They are limiting their opportunities in an 
era when moneymaking opportunities for good thoroughbreds have proliferated. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' management of Criminal Type typifies the national scope of his program. 
Criminal Type spent the winter in California for the rich stakes races there, 
then went to Arkansas, Maryland and New York for major stakes before returning 
to California for a $1-million race. He has earned more than $2.2 million in 
these travels. Now he is in New York for the rest of the year, aiming for the 
prestigious fall stakes and the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas can shuttle his horses around the country because he has bases of 
operation at several race tracks, with an assistant trainer in each -- an idea 
that appalls traditionalists. A true horseman is one who scrutinizes his 
animals every day, watches them gallop, feels their legs and ankles, watches 
how they eat and bases his handling of them on such nuances. 
</P>
<P>
But Lukas has thrived by establishing and supervising far-flung divisions of 
his stable. "I think the absolute key to doing this is quality control," he 
said. "You cannot ever see a deviation of quality from one division to the 
other. The barns are the same. The feeding program is the same. There are a lot 
of young assistants in this business who think they have a better way of doing 
things, but the people who last in this operation are ones who have blind faith 
-- and a high intensity level. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what makes it easy to ship horses around the country. Most horses, 
when they ship, have to adjust. There's never an adjustment necessary in our 
divisions. It's the McDonald's principle. We'll give you a franchise, and that 
franchise is going to be the same wherever you go." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when most people in the horse industry would have hooted at 
the concept of the McStable. His record $105 million in earnings has answered 
his detractors, and as surely as McDonald's revolutionized the hamburger 
business, Lukas has redefined the training profession.

Events in the Persian Gulf have kept an "enormous force" in the thoroughbred 
racing world from attending Saratoga Spring's 70th annual yearling sales. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day auction began Tuesday night without Sheik Hamdan al Maktoum and 
his brothers Maktoum and Mohammed, members of the royal family of the United 
Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has kept the sheiks home. 
</P>
<P>
"They're an enormous force at the sale," said Cot Campbell, owner of Preakness 
winner Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
The Maktoums spent $14.8 million on the first day of last month's yearling 
sales at Keeneland, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
In Saratoga Springs last year, Hamdan al Maktoum bought 16 yearlings for $7.8 
million, nearly one quarter of the $31.8 million taken in by Fasig-Tipton Co., 
auctioneer for the Saratoga sales. 
</P>
<P>
While the Maktoums have agents at the sale, Campbell said the sheiks' 
representatives are less likely to bid past preset limits. 
</P>
<P>
After two nights, 105 head have been sold at an average price of $229,362 and a 
gross of $24,083,000. Last year, 84 head had been sold for $22,357,000, or an 
average of $266,155. 
</P>
<P>
The average per head after two nights of selling was down 14% from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A bay filly by Danzig from Family Style sold by Brushwood Stable topped the 
sales list Wednesday. Dr. David Richardson, acting as agent for an unnamed 
purchaser, paid $1.2 million for her.

CENTER IS A THOROUGHBRED AMONG MUSTANGS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: MIRA COSTA HIGH'S DAVIS HAS IMPROVED HIS STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE TO 
BECOME ONE OF THE SOUTH BAY'S TOP HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mira Costa High basketball Coach Glenn Marx is frequently asked the same 
question concerning Chris Davis, the Mustangs' 6-foot-8, 235-pound center: How 
good can he get? 
</P>
<P>
Marx can only speculate. He knows the answer will come sometime, perhaps 
several years, after Davis graduates from high school. 
</P>
<P>
Entering his senior year, Davis is just beginning to tap his potential as a 
basketball player. Moreover, he doesn't turn 17 until March, making him a year 
younger than most of his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
And his size 16 shoes indicate there is potential for additional growth. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the future, he could be excellent," scout Don Mead said. "All the 
ingredients are there." 
</P>
<P>
Already rated a mid-level college prospect, Davis enhanced his chances of 
attracting a major university with an impressive summer. He was selected one of 
the top 15 players at the Nike West Coast All-Star Basketball Camp at Cal Poly 
Pomona and he was chosen most valuable player after leading Mira Costa to the 
championship of the Pepsi Grid-Hoops Festival last month at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
With the summer behind him, Davis will wait to see what college offers come his 
way. Mead said coaches usually begin lining up home recruiting visits late in 
September. Many of the best high school seniors will sign letters of intent 
during the early one-week signing period in November. 
</P>
<P>
"He's being heavily recruited," Mead said of Davis. "He'll get a fairly high 
college scholarship. Maybe not as high as he should, because he's a late 
developer." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who averaged about 9.5 points a game last season, scored 32 points July 
21 in the festival semifinals against Serra and 30 in the final against 
Banning. He considered the games the best performances of his budding career. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I wasn't too aggressive," Davis said. "But something's happened. I 
guess I've grown up and gotten more physical." 
</P>
<P>
Marx has witnessed the transformation of his standout player from a pudgy, 
asthma-weakened sophomore to a muscular, confident senior with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
He predicts big things for Davis next season, when Mira Costa competes in the 
realigned Ocean League with Morningside, Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes and 
Redondo, all formidable opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone wants to contend with Chris Davis on the high school level next 
year, it's going to cost them 30 points to do it," Marx said. "He is going to 
be accountable for 30 points a game, whether he is getting the ball and scoring 
or allowing one of our shooters to get open." 
</P>
<P>
Davis displayed his improved offensive skills in the North Torrance Summer 
League, which concluded play last week. Bill Atkinson, North's interim coach, 
said Davis was clearly the most impressive player in the 20-team league. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel he's one of the top five players in the South Bay," Atkinson said. "I 
noticed at the beginning of summer league that he's finishing his shot a lot 
better. Before, he was a little bit tentative. But now it doesn't matter if 
people are hanging onto him. He's going up and dunking the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Said Marx: "I saw him miss a lot of dunks in the regular season. But he's 
putting them down now." 
</P>
<P>
Davis credits his improved strength and endurance to conditioning programs 
implemented by Marx when he became coach two years ago. They include a weight 
training program overseen by fitness authority Marv Marinovich, father of USC 
quarterback Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"Marv Marinovich and his weight program have developed (Davis) to a point where 
it's not uncommon for him to catch a ball in the box, take one step and slam on 
people," Marx said. "He does it regularly." 
</P>
<P>
The workouts have also helped Davis fight his asthma, which in past seasons 
preyed on his stamina and forced frequent benchings. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be impossible for me to play a whole game," he said. "But it's 
starting to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his asthma, Davis is allowed to attend Mira Costa on a medical 
permit although he lives in Lynwood. His family used to live in Manhattan 
Beach, but moved after his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
"The air is better out here for my asthma," he said. "It's too smoggy in 
Lynwood." 
</P>
<P>
The Lynwood air didn't stunt Davis' growth, however. He grew four inches to 6-7 
between his freshman and sophomore years and earned a starting spot on the 
varsity, helping the Mustangs to a 7-15 record in 1989 and a late-season upset 
over playoff-bound Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' improvement as a player has mirrored Mira Costa's improvement as a team. 
Last year, with Davis playing a more prominent role, the Mustangs were 15-9 and 
earned a CIF playoff berth with a third-place finish in league. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis had to share the spotlight in 1990 with Chris Hobbs, the team's 
All-CIF shooting guard, and forward Canyon Ceman. 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured, that won't be the case next season, Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were more balanced," he said. "We weren't as focused in getting 
(Davis) the ball. This year we've become focused, and that's why he got 30 and 
32 (points). He's come into his own." 
</P>
<P>
Marx, a former coach at St. Bernard High who has worked with many of the 
Southland's best prep players over the years, said Davis compares favorably 
with several of the top big men to come out of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the South Bay in the last 10 years, you can mention Ed Stokes, 
Leonard Taylor (both of St. Bernard) and maybe Bill Laimbeer (of Palos Verdes) 
going years back," he said. "He's in that mold." 
</P>
<P>
Marx sees Davis developing into a dominant offensive player, similar to an 
accomplished big man with the NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
"The one player who comes right to mind is James Edwards of the Detroit 
Pistons," Marx said. "He has the same ability to get the ball in the post and 
use his body to get his shot off. He can step out and hit a 10-footer." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing his weaknesses, Davis said he needs to improve his perimeter defense 
and foot speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, he needs to get rid of some baby fat," Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
But the veteran scout said that Davis' strengths outweigh his weaknesses, 
including a solid academic standing. Davis carries a 2.6 grade-point average 
and has scored an NCAA-qualifying 800 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very intelligent kid," Mead said. "He has the right kind of attitude 
and he's well-coached, which helps." 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Davis said he will consider every college that shows an 
interest in him. Early suitors include schools from the Pacific-10, Big Eight 
and Western Athletic conferences. "It doesn't matter where," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said whoever signs Davis will be getting a player whose value appears to 
be increasing each day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a different player than he was in February, a radically different 
player," Marx said. "One reason is that he is 16 years old. Why shouldn't a kid 
who's just turned 16 be blossoming?" 
</P>
<P>
That's one question Davis seems to have answered this summer.

AFTER MAKING A CLEAN BREAK FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, SANDY SMITH NOW 
HOSTS DINERS.

<P>
Sandy Smith was fed up with being a restaurateur. He had sold his car, cashed 
out his life insurance policy, cleaned out his savings. Everything was sunk 
into his restaurant, the Rosarito Beach Cafe, near the mission in downtown 
Ventura. He measured his net worth in tortillas and beans. If you wanted a 
piece of him, you had to order off the menu. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't making any money," Smith recalls, "I was tired of working so hard, I 
smelled like mesquite every day, I was irritable because I was tired. I just 
wasn't happy with the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Rosarito Beach, he decided, was for sale. Let some other poor fool discover 
that owning a little cafe doesn't match up with the romantic vision that lures 
so many entrepreneurs -- especially if the owner is doing most of the cooking. 
</P>
<P>
That was nearly two years ago. Smith still smells like mesquite. Instead of 
selling the cafe at the nadir of his burnout, he fired up his resolve and his 
grill, and now Rosarito Beach is smoking. The cafe is drawing critics' acclaim 
and diners from at least three counties. Smith has two new investors, a 
renovation is on the drawing board, and within a year he plans to either knock 
out a wall or find a larger space. He and his partners have also submitted a 
bid to the city of Ventura to purchase the old Pierano's grocery store, the 
distinctive brick edifice across from the mission, which they would like to 
convert to a restaurant-deli. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Smith said, he is having fun. 
</P>
<P>
Burly and red-bearded, Smith, 39, is a hulking presence in his small 
establishment. Rosarito regulars know the routine. He emerges from the kitchen 
in shorts and a T-shirt, sees a familiar face and hunkers down or straddles a 
chair for a chat. He will discuss with equal enthusiasm and expertise anything 
from California State University's efforts to find a suitable spot for a 
Ventura County campus to the state of downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
In Smith's case the talk isn't idle. Four months ago he co-founded ACTIVE 
(Action Committee To Influence Ventura's Environments), a grass-roots lobby 
that supported CSU's choice of Taylor Ranch. He represents the group on CSU's 
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) advisory committee on site selection and was 
appointed recently to Ventura's advisory committee on downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Ventura, Smith cherishes childhood memories of taking the 
bus downtown to shop at J.C. Penney, See's Candy or to buy tamales at a little 
deli on Olive Street. The Ventura Freeway, Ventura Keys, Buenaventura Mall, 
Holiday Inn -- none existed in those days. Five Points marked the east end of 
town. Downtown, he said, "had such a nice feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
And so downtown was where he wanted to place his restaurant. He knows that 
Ventura will never be the yawning seaside province he remembers. But the old 
section could regain its vitality, could once again have a nice, if different, 
feel to it. That's why he wanted to see CSU build its university at nearby 
Taylor Ranch, to re-establish the area as the heart of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Launching a successful restaurant is arguably the lesser of Smith's two most 
significant professional accomplishments. In 1977, armed with a bachelor's 
degree in humanistic psychology from Sonoma State University and a teaching 
credential from UC Santa Barbara, he landed a job as studies director for 
Ventura County's Criminal Justice Planning Board. Within two years he parlayed 
that into a position with the district attorney's office. There he was asked by 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury to develop a program to ease the psychological 
burden of crime victims and witnesses making their way through the criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
A major thrust of the program, Smith said, was "making law enforcement more 
sensitive to the emotional needs of certain types of victims," specifically 
victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and other violent crimes. "What we 
were trying to do in the victim/witness movement -- and it really was a 
movement -- was really change the whole criminal justice system, almost from 
top to bottom." 
</P>
<P>
Smith met his mandate so successfully that Ventura County's victim/witness 
program became nationally recognized and became a model. Other communities 
studied it, with Smith's counsel widely sought. He was interviewed on the 
"Today" show. And then he quit. 
</P>
<P>
What started as a creative challenge unfettered by structure or precedent, he 
said, became a bureaucratic chore mired in politics and paper work. Worse, 
Smith said, he found it wrenching to constantly confront human misfortune. "The 
sheer number of children that are sexually abused day in and day out, the sheer 
number of women that are battered . . . it just eats at you," he said. "You 
can't help but have that kind of stress effect you in some way." 
</P>
<P>
Smith left the district attorney's office in 1984 determined to put fun back in 
his life. Restaurant work during his graduate school days had been fun -- 
waiting tables at L'Auberge in Ojai, bartending at the Hungry Hunter in Ventura 
-- so opening a restaurant of his own seemed a natural. He did brief kitchen 
stints in two local restaurants during two years of preparation, and by 
December, 1986, the Rosarito Beach Cafe was a reality -- a 90-hour-a-week 
headache, but a reality. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is named for Mexico's Rosarito Beach. The menu, like the Baja 
community, is oriented toward seafood, a discomfitting discovery for anyone 
looking for nachos and a No. 4 combination plate. Smith calls his fare 
"authentic regional Mexican." Thick, homemade flour tortillas (sorry, no 
tortilla chips). Borracho beans (no refrieds). Three fresh salsas. Salmon, 
yellowtail, white sea bass, red snapper, mahi-mahi, swordfish -- the menu 
changes frequently depending on which fish can be obtained fresh -- marinated 
Yucatan-style in citrus juices, spices and achiote chili seeds, then 
mesquite-grilled. Or, if you prefer, poached in a caper-green, olive tomato 
sauce in Veracruzana tradition. Chicken mole, machaca tacos, shrimp enchiladas, 
crab and cheese relleno . . . 
</P>
<P>
"People's perceptions of Mexican food are nothing like what Mexican food is 
like in Mexico," Smith said. "People will come in, and we'll start talking 
about the seafood specials, and they'll look up and say, 'I thought this was a 
Mexican restaurant,' you know, like they don't have fish in Mexico or 
something. It's hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
The uninitiated sometimes sit, look at the menu and walk out. "I'm not trying 
to get that market of people who want to go out and have a $6 Mexican dinner," 
Smith conceded. "I'm going after people who want to enjoy a piece of salmon 
with a very innovative sauce, have a creme brulee for dessert and drink a nice 
bottle of wine." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Sandy Smith has made a clean break from the criminal justice system. 
He has acquired the temperament of a chef and he spares no effort to ensure 
that at Rosarito Beach there are no victims.

UP CLOSE: SANDY SMITH 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Owner of Rosarito Beach Cafe in downtown Ventura and community 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
Favorite meal: Bucatini all'amatriciana (pasta in tomato cream sauce with hot 
peppers) and a bottle of Chianti at Pan E Vino Restaurant in Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
Why he likes downtown Ventura: "I like looking out the window and seeing people 
from L.A. with lots of money looking for antiques. Followed by some real 
interesting character, a pack rat with a raccoon cap and a sign on his bike 
saying, 'Your trash is my cash.' " 
</P>
<P>
Quote: "If I ever make it big, I will owe it to Sam Ferraro who told me I 
didn't have a chance of making it in the restaurant business." Ferraro is owner 
of Ferraro's Italian Restaurant in Ventura.

ZAUN CATCHING ON TO LIFE AS A PRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregg Zaun thought he knew what to expect when he signed a professional 
baseball contract with the Baltimore Orioles at the end of last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun's uncle, Dodger veteran Rick Dempsey, had counseled him about the road 
that a ballplayer, particularly a catcher, must travel to reach the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as Zaun's first pro season winds down, the former St. Francis High star 
said his rookie season has not been devoid of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot tougher to play everyday than I thought it would be," said Zaun, 
who is the starting catcher for the Bluefield (W.V.) Orioles, Baltimore's 
affiliate in the Appalachian Rookie League. "I don't have quite the spring in 
my legs that I thought I would. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play every day, you're always tired. You have to eat right and you 
can't stay out late if you want to be able to play the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Entering the week, Zaun, 5-foot-9, 170 pounds, was batting .323 with one home 
run and 10 runs batted in with 24 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun, however, considers himself a defensive specialist. Though just 18, he has 
been entrusted by the organization to call all of the pitches for a staff 
composed, almost entirely, of former college and junior college players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best catchers in the league," Bluefield Manager Gus Gil said. 
"For his age, it's amazing the way he handles pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"In that regard, he's very mature, he knows how to set up hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Zaun was selected The Times' Glendale-area player of the year in 1989 after he 
batted .475 with 32 RBIs and eight doubles for St. Francis. He was recruited by 
several Division I schools, including USC, UCLA, Loyola Marymount and Oklahoma, 
but he signed a letter of intent with Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun's longing to be a Longhorn probably affected his selection in the amateur 
draft. The Orioles selected Zaun in the 17th round, then spent the summer 
trying to persuade him to start his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun, who played for the United States junior national team at the world 
championships in Canada last summer, was set to attend college until he found 
out that Texas had also recruited another catcher who was a junior college 
All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"(Texas) told me I was going to come in and play right away," Zaun said. "When 
I found out they were also bringing in someone else who fit their mold and was 
sure to play, I decided to sign with the Orioles and take my chances." 
</P>
<P>
Because he signed after the regular season, the Orioles sent Zaun to their 
winter Instructional League in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun caught bullpen workouts for Ben McDonald, the No. 1 draft pick in the 
country last year, and played daily against the best prospects in other 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of tough because I was playing against guys from high (Class) A 
and double-A teams," Zaun said. "But by the end of Instructional League, I was 
hitting the ball pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Orioles had eliminated their extended spring training program this 
year, Zaun was assigned to Class-A Wausau (Wis.) in the Midwest League 
following regular spring training. In June, when the short-season rookie 
leagues began play, he was sent to Bluefield. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling through the Appalachian League to outposts throughout Tennessee, 
Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina, Zaun has become acclimated to life 
as a professional. And he's not the only family member riding the buses from 
town to town. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun's cousin, John Dempsey, is a catcher for Johnson City (Tenn.), the St. 
Louis Cardinals' affiliate in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played once at their park and once at ours," Zaun said. "My mom was out 
here when we played them and it was like a big family reunion." 
</P>
<P>
Zaun is hoping to follow his uncle, Rick, into the major leagues. He said his 
first season as a pro has introduced him to many of the things he'll have to 
know to climb through the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get too excited when things are going good or too upset when they're 
going bad," Zaun said. "People think you can give 100% all the time, but when 
you play everyday that's very difficult so you just try to do your best. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hustle and sacrifice yourself and do the things necessary to win 
ballgames. You have to be a team player and that's the only thing I know how to 
do." 
</P>

former St. Francis High catcher has still managed to bat a lofty .323.

THE IRON MAN DEFEATED BOXING'S BEST, BUT NOT ROBBER'S SHOTGUN BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They called Carlos Chavez the Iron Man, the little boxer of the 1940s and '50s 
who beat the likes of ring champions Manuel Ortiz, Lauro Salas and "Golden Boy" 
Art Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
He was quiet and modest outside the ring. But inside, he let his hands do the 
talking. If Chavez made it past three rounds, his opponent didn't stand a 
chance. He was a slow starter, but he didn't go down easily, said those who 
knew and boxed him. 
</P>
<P>
The man who last week shot and killed the Iron Man may have found that out. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, 68, died about 9 p.m. last Wednesday near his Eagle Rock home, the 
victim of what police believe was a robbery gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was walking home from his nightly rounds at a pizza parlor and 
neighborhood bar, in the 4100 block of Verdugo Road, where he typically drank 
water and talked to friends. On his way home he was accosted by a 28- to 
30-year-old man, said Detective John Munguia of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses told police that they saw Chavez struggling with the man. One of 
the witnesses called out, and the startled gunman shot Chavez once in the chest 
with a shotgun, Munguia said. Chavez died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"The man was a fighter and he put up a fight," Munguia said. "He just didn't 
throw his hands up and give up . . . He was in very good shape. But anything 
physical's not going to help stop a shotgun blast." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was well-liked and well-known by neighbors and community merchants. He 
visited Verdugo Pizza and Tony's Place practically every night. He did not 
carry large sums of cash. His wallet, containing $14, was found in his pocket, 
Munguia said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had received reports that others were involved. Now, Munguia said, 
police believe that the assailant acted alone. But little else is known. 
Witnesses offered few details about the gunman or where he fled, the detective 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are investigating whether the same person may have been 
responsible for a fatal shooting in Glendale hours later. Chul Woo Nam, 50, was 
shot once in the chest with a shotgun. His body was found about 3 a.m. near his 
home on Jackson Street. Glendale police said he was not robbed. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery of who killed Chavez, and why, bothers his three sons, his friends 
and his former opponents. The Iron Man, they said, was a gentle, quiet, retired 
brewery worker. He was healthy, still at his boxing weight of about 138 pounds, 
but walked with a limp as a result of a stroke years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't have allowed anyone to take his money from him," said Michael 
Chavez, 42, a Santa Barbara resident. "But my dad was so small. Even if he did 
get feisty with someone, he couldn't have done much harm. It was a brutal way 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Chavez, a second-generation American whose parents came from Mexico, 
began boxing when he was about 13. He turned professional at age 17 and soon 
gained notoriety for his steely determination inside and his quiet, gentle 
demeanor outside the ropes, according to relatives, former opponents and boxing 
records. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1940s and early 1950s he fought frequently in Los Angeles against 
prominent boxers who went on to be state and world champions. Seven of his 
opponents -- including Willie Pep and Jimmy Carter -- became world champions. 
</P>
<P>
He fought Manuel Ortiz, a professional bantamweight world champion, five times 
-- with one win, two draws and two losses. 
</P>
<P>
His most famous fight was against Ortiz -- a 15-round bout in 1946 before more 
than 10,000 fans at the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium, according to relatives 
and friends familiar with his career. That one ended in a draw. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez also fought Art Aragon, a former pro lightweight state champion who now 
is a bail bondsman in Van Nuys. In June, 1950, Chavez won a 10-round decision 
in a non-title fight against Aragon. But in a rematch that November, the Golden 
Boy knocked him out in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a slow starter, but later on he would kill you," recalled Aragon this 
week. "Carlos was not a bully, and I liked him for that. He was a classy guy. 
He was one of the few guys in boxing history I looked up to." 
</P>
<P>
After retiring in 1956, Chavez got a job at the Schlitz brewery in Van Nuys, 
and in 1985 was inducted into the Southern California Boxing Hall of Fame. But 
he maintained little interest in fighting after his retirement, his sons and 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"When Sunday fights were on TV, Carlos would sit in the corner and people would 
ask him questions," said Annette Williams, a bartender at Tony's Place. 
"Otherwise, he would never talk about his career." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's wife, Pauline, died in 1983. He continued to live in his Eagle Rock 
home on Avenue 40 with his eldest son, Steve. Later, he developed diabetes and 
then suffered a stroke that left him with a limp, his sons said. But he 
continued his nightly treks to Verdugo Pizza and Tony's Place -- despite 
warnings from his sons and neighbors that it was unsafe for him to venture out 
alone at night. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a professional fighter, and I guess you could say he was violent when 
he was in the ring," said Ron Chavez, 46. "But that was 30 years ago. He was a 
very quiet person. He wouldn't hurt a flea."
