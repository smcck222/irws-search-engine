SEWER GLITCH FORCES CAMPERS TO ROUGH IT

<P>
Visitors to the McGrath State Beach campgrounds in Oxnard this weekend may be 
getting away from civilization a little more than they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Sewer problems earlier in the week shut down toilets and showers, and they are 
expected to stay off for about 10 more days, said Jeff Price, chief ranger for 
the Channel Coast District. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh drinking water is still available. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 portable toilets have been placed at the campgrounds, but visitors 
have not taken kindly to them. Many campers, who have been looking forward to 
escaping the smog and inhaling fresh ocean air are annoyed by the toilets' 
chemical smell and have complained, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
To appease visitors, the park is refunding $6 off the regular $12 nightly 
camping rate. Full refunds will be given to people who have made reservations 
but decide to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
All 174 sites at the campground have been reserved for this weekend, and 
officials are expecting about 750 people. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems people like to camp out but not having flushable toilets is, I guess, 
a little too primitive for some," Price said. "One woman won't let her children 
use the portable toilets because she's afraid they'll fall in." Another woman, 
he said, threw her hairbrush at a ranger's car "when she found out she couldn't 
wash her hair." 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that a lot of people are frustrated," Price said. "Some of them 
have been planning on spending their vacation here for a long time and this is 
really getting on their nerves." MAJA RADEVICH

AL MARTINEZ: ON THE BRINK OF THE ABYSS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the world trembling once more on the brink of the abyss, the plight of a 
dying boy holds no cosmic significance. Events in the Middle East far 
overshadow the pain of that single fading life. Millions may suffer if the 
Persian Gulf explodes, while only few will cry for Richie Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
But still ... 
</P>
<P>
To see him lying motionless on a hospital bed, hooked to machines that preserve 
and monitor his life, to see his dark hair tousled as though he's been out 
playing, claws at the heart as much as events in Iraq tear at our fears. 
</P>
<P>
We die one by one, each light fading alone, no matter how massive the killing, 
or by what means. There is no comfort in numbers when the last breath is taken. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Nunez, 14, is in the final stages of life because he can't get a lung 
transplant. The reason he can't get one is that it costs $200,000 and no one is 
willing to put up the money or do it for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
No hospital will even involve itself in a fund-raising drive because, as one 
spokesman says, if the drive fails and the hospital doesn't proceed with the 
operation, it will make the institution look bad. 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "If we go ahead with it anyhow, it will cost us millions." 
</P>
<P>
Savor the irony. Billions for war, but not a penny for Richie Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't wanted to write this column. I dislike trading on human grief to 
seduce an audience. I'd rather make you laugh than make you cry. 
</P>
<P>
But still ... 
</P>
<P>
"I need help," the mother told me, crying into the phone. "It's my boy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"If he lived in Brentwood and not in the barrio," a child welfare worker said, 
"he'd have had the transplant already." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is simple. Richie was born into a world that still measures 
significance by status, and by that measure, he has none. 
</P>
<P>
Half Apache and half Mexican, his father is gone and his unemployed mother, 
Beverly Jojola, is on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's life has been hard from the beginning. At three months, he was 
stricken simultaneously with measles and pneumonia. That he survived at all was 
a mixed blessing. A time bomb was planted in his system. 
</P>
<P>
"The sickness kept coming back over and over again," the mother said. "He would 
have a hard time breathing, and the doctors would always say it was the flu. 
They told me to give him cough medicine and Tylenol and plenty of fluids. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
We were in a small office near the intensive care unit of a Los Angeles 
hospital. Richie was under deep sedation. Machines breathed for him to relieve 
badly overworked lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago," Beverly Jojola was saying, "when Richie got really sick, they 
told me he had a lung and kidney disease. He was put on dialysis last January, 
but they said he needed a lung transplant to live." 
</P>
<P>
She looked at me, not quite believing all this was happening, and said, "He 
could die." Then she cried. 
</P>
<P>
In all probability, Richie is dying. Even if the money were raised, or a 
hospital, in rare generosity, absorbed the cost of a transplant, it may already 
be too late. 
</P>
<P>
Time was on their side once. Beverly Jojola used it trying to raise money 
through her church, without success. 
</P>
<P>
Then one of Richie's doctors said he would participate in a public appeal, but 
was discouraged from doing so by the hospital for which he works. 
</P>
<P>
Image counted more than Richie did. 
</P>
<P>
A request for funding was made to California Children's Services, a state 
agency, but the request was denied. A lung transplant was too experimental. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Youth Programs, a private organization, tried with no better success than 
Jojola to stir interest in a fund-raising program. 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Alice Drucker fumes at the notion that no one will help save 
Richie, but simultaneously asks that the hospitals involved not be named. 
</P>
<P>
"They could withhold referrals," she says helplessly," and there are other 
children. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But still . . . 
</P>
<P>
I stand over the bed of Richie Nunez and wonder what dreams will perish with 
this frail youth, what wonders will go unperceived. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so smart," his mother says. "He gets straight As in everything. He said 
to me, 'Tell them if they just lend us the money, I'll pay them back after 
college.' Oh, what a boy." 
</P>
<P>
There is no place for Richie Nunez in the cool disciplines of institutional 
mercy. His life is a blip in the system, and his death will mean no disruption 
in the public order. 
</P>
<P>
I grieve over that as much as I grieve over the fading life of a boy brought 
down too early in his years. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Nietzsche said, "When you look long into the abyss, the abyss also looks 
into you," I fear for us all. The abyss, even now, looks back.

It happened the other day: Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed Kosmal, ticketed for walking 
his dog without a leash, pleaded not guilty in court on the grounds that he 
controlled the animal with a "psychological leash." 
</P>
<P>
Then, using a stratagem that smacked of "L.A. Law," if not "Perry Mason," 
Kosmal called a surprise witness -- the dog itself. 
</P>
<P>
The creature, which was in the audience unbeknown to Municipal Court Judge 
Judith O. Stein, came forward on its psychological leash and plopped down next 
to the witness stand. (The dog was not, however, asked to raise its paw and 
take the oath.) 
</P>
<P>
Stein found Kosmal guilty but suspended the fine when he promised to use a 
physical leash henceforth. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding took place, of course, in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams may have forsaken L.A. for Orange County but it's obvious that John 
Ferraro and Zev Yaroslavsky have forgiven them. The two L.A. City Council 
members rode on the team flight to Berlin, where the Anaheim Rams tackle the 
Kansas City Chiefs today. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, who took an aide, and Yaroslavsky, who took his wife, said they used 
campaign funds to pay the tab: $1,000 per person for the round-trip flight plus 
a stay at a posh hotel. Ferraro termed it a "good-will" trip because L.A. is a 
sister city of Berlin (if not of Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
The recent disclosure that water usage at Mayor Tom Bradley's city-owned 
mansion in Hancock Park had increased 25% over the same period last year 
inspired radio station KODJ characters Charlie Tuna, Dean Goss and Lynda 
Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
They set forth 10 theories on why His Honor can't cut down during this drought, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
* He doesn't want authorities to dry-mop the Bradley Terminal at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
* He's trying to turn the L.A. River into a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
* He's got a political fire he's trying to put out.

The departure of one United Airlines flight from Burbank had been delayed for 
more than two hours when the plane finally began to taxi. And taxi. And taxi. 
</P>
<P>
"I know some of you are in a hurry to get to San Francisco," the pilot joked as 
they headed for a distant runway. "I just want to assure you that we'll be 
picking up speed as soon as we make our way to the 101. And we'll be stopping 
for pie and coffee along the way."

Then, too, the passengers were piling up those Frequent Freeway Flier points.

Christmas Craziness seems to start earlier every year. But even Tiny Tim might 
have winced at the display of holiday wreaths, lights and trees at the Beverly

An 8-year-old boy who was hit by a car while riding his bicycle in Meiners Oaks 
was in stable condition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kristoffer Gonzales of Meiners Oaks broke his leg in the accident, which 
occurred at 5:20 p.m. Thursday while he was riding with friends, said Officer 
Jim Utter of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Kristoffer was going south on Pueblo Avenue when he rode through a stop sign 
and in front of a car traveling west on Fernando Drive, Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was struck by the bumper of the car driven by Jeremy Ogletree, 16, of 
Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
Kristoffer was taken to Ojai Valley Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was later transferred to Ventura County Medical Center, where he was listed 
in stable condition Friday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges are expected to be brought against the driver, Utter said. CAROL

INVESTIGATION OF CONTRACTOR MAY WIDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Labor fraud charges filed this week against a Lancaster contractor in 
connection with a recent public works project have raised concerns among 
Lancaster officials about the contractor's labor practices on five other city 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster City Atty. David McEwen said Friday that he plans to look into the 
possibility of further investigation and other legal options in the wake of the 
criminal case filed Wednesday against the owners of Paxin Electric Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we need to look into," McEwen said. "I would have some concerns 
over whether it affects the contractor's ability to perform. I need more facts 
on what our legal rights are." 
</P>
<P>
McEwen said it may be legally difficult, and perhaps inappropriate, to suspend 
or revoke more than $800,000 in city contracts currently held by Paxin 
Electric. 
</P>
<P>
State labor officials have accused company President James Paxin, 38, and his 
wife, Brenda, 40, of defrauding employees out of about $170,000 on projects at 
Lancaster City Hall and a Santa Clarita park in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster City Councilmen Arnie Rodio and George Root said in interviews Friday 
that the criminal charges and previous fines levied against Paxin by state 
labor authorities for the same type of offense raise the possibility that 
similar wage violations may be occurring on current projects. Rodio said the 
city should examine the feasibility of halting Paxin's work on those contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we should judge the guy guilty," Rodio said. But, he added, 
"If there's something the city can do, we'll do it . . . He's entitled to a 
fair profit, but he's not entitled to make it on the backs of his workers." 
</P>
<P>
The Paxins and their attorney have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Because the city has limited powers of investigation, city officials said, one 
possibility would be to ask state labor investigators to determine whether 
Paxin is paying state-mandated prevailing wages and if his records are 
accurate. The state requires contractors carrying out public works projects to 
pay certain wages to workers. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Miller, regional manager of the state Division of Labor Standards 
Enforcement, said his office often responds to such requests from public 
agencies. And he said there may be further review of other Paxin projects 
anyway as part of the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
The Paxins were charged with conspiracy and misappropriating employee wages on 
subcontracting work at Lancaster City Hall and the Santa Clarita Park by paying 
workers less than the required wage. James Paxin was also charged with filing 
falsified pay sheets on which employees were allegedly forced to document that 
they received higher wages than he actually paid them. 
</P>
<P>
Paxin's company was previously fined more than $50,000 for similar violations 
of state law, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Paxin Electric is working on about $650,000 in electrical subcontracts for the 
city, plus a large electrical subcontract on the $8-million Lancaster 
Performing Arts Center currently being built by the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they do not know how much Paxin's performing arts center 
contract is worth because the general contractor is not required to inform them 
of the amount. There was no comment from the project's general contractor, 
Cates Construction Inc. of Lancaster. Cates was also the general contractor on 
the City Hall project, for which Paxin was charged by the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office this week after a nine-month investigation by the 
state labor standards division. 
</P>
<P>
Paxin also was recently awarded a $127,000 contract for wiring a Lancaster 
baseball field and recently completed an $82,000 underground wiring project, 
both as a general contractor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Councilman George Theophanis, who described himself as a longtime 
friend of Paxin's, said Friday that he sees no need for the city to scrutinize 
Paxin's contracts until the criminal case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"That ought to be entirely up to the state," Theophanis said. "I have no reason 
to believe he's guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Henry Hearns said that unless a worker comes forward with a specific 
complaint, there is little the city can do other than make sure that paperwork 
submitted to it by the company is in good order. Mayor William Pursley was on 
vacation.

PLANNING STAFF FAVORS EXPANSION OF LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON: OFFICIALS RECOMMEND THAT A 5-YEAR LIMIT BE PLACED ON THE 
OPERATING PERMIT FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL DUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city planning officials recommended Friday that the controversial 
Lopez Canyon landfill near Lake View Terrace be expanded and allowed to remain 
open for at least five more years to handle the city's growing trash output. 
</P>
<P>
Both pro- and anti-dump factions interpreted the recommendation as at least a 
partial victory. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilmen Ernani Bernardi and Joel Wachs and homeowners 
living near the dump have been fighting for years to close the facility, saying 
it is poisoning the neighborhood's air and clogging local streets with trash 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Although dump opponents did not succeed in getting the city Planning Department 
staff to recommend the dump be closed, as they wanted, some were heartened by 
the five-year limit on the dump's operating permit that the staff recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"At least they will have to come back in 1995," said David Mays, chief deputy 
to Bernardi, who represents the area and has sought to either close the dump or 
reopen other city dumps to relieve pressure on the Lake View Terrace facility. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Bureau of Sanitation is seeking a permit to expand dumping 
operations into unused parts of the landfill, to increase the number of trucks 
per day from 400 at present to 650, to raise the height of the dump by 70 feet, 
to 1,840 feet above sea level, and to continue operating the landfill until 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
The planning staff's recommendation goes to the City Planning Commission, which 
will consider the sanitation bureau's request for the conditional use permit on 
Aug. 21 at a 9 a.m. hearing at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys. The 
commission decision is expected to be appealed to the council by whichever side 
is unhappy with the result. 
</P>
<P>
In the staff report released Friday, planners recommended that the bureau be 
allowed to expand the areas in which it dumps and increase the number of trucks 
to 650 a day, but that the height of the dump not be allowed to rise and that 
the permit be only for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Planning official Bob Rogers suggested that the permit be only for five years 
so that the case can be reviewed in 1995 "in the context of the projected 
opening of Elsmere Canyon," a proposed dump in the Santa Clarita Valley that 
city and county officials say could handle most Los Angeles County trash for 
decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county, which would jointly operate the Elsmere landfill, are 
preparing to obtain state and local permits needed to open the huge dump, 
possibly as early as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers also said he saw no justification for increasing the height of the Lopez 
dump -- a source of complaints from some homeowners who contend that the 
mountain of waste blocks light from their yards. 
</P>
<P>
Michael M. Miller, assistant director of the Bureau of Sanitation, said the 
agency "can live with a five-year permit. We are hoping, of course, that if all 
goes well, Elsmere will be ready in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
Under the city-county agreement on development of Elsmere, Lopez -- the sole 
remaining city-owned dump -- is to be closed within one year after Elsmere is 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also said that keeping the height of the mounded trash at 1,770 feet "is 
no problem because we did not plan to go above that height during the next five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Miller also said that the bureau envisioned sending no more than 500 trucks per 
day to Lopez Canyon during the next five years, "but we welcome the flexibility 
the higher number would give us." 
</P>
<P>
Mays, Bernardi's deputy, said that "more than 600 trucks a day will be far too 
much because even the 400 at present are a significant burden on the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mays said he was "somewhat encouraged by the staff report, 
because the pattern seems to be that every time a different agency takes a look 
at this issue, they recognize more of the problems we have been talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Anson Burlingame of Sunland, a longtime opponent of the Lopez landfill, said 
Friday he will ask that the Aug. 21 commission hearing be postponed until the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District acts on complaints that methane gas 
emissions from the dump are a threat to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
An air quality district hearing board took testimony again Friday in El Monte 
in a continuing investigation into emissions at the dump. The hearing began in 
April and is not expected to be completed until September. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence has been presented at these hearings that contradicts" statements 
made by bureau officials, Burlingame said. "How can the city try to make a 
decision on the conditional use permit until these hearings are over?" 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's hearing by the air quality district, several sanitation bureau 
officials heatedly accused the hearing board of holding the Lopez landfill to 
higher standards than other dumps, and said they would gather data to prove 
their point. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ed Ostrowski, the city's chief sanitary engineer, acknowledged in his 
testimony that some areas of Lopez emitted more gas than allowed by state 
standards, that more gas wells needed to be drilled and that the existing gas 
control system "needs to be fine-tuned."

PUMPING LIMITATION GETS INITIAL OK

<P>
A local water agency has given its initial approval to an ordinance designed to 
reduce excessive pumping of ground water and is expected to adopt it at its 
next meeting Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, proposed by the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency and 
tentatively approved Thursday, would reduce the extraction of ground water by 
5% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks would reach 75% by the year 2009 for the agency, which manages water 
resources contributing to the water supply for more than 100,000 Ventura County 
residents, said county hydrologist Rick Farnsworth. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the restrictions will affect areas from Moorpark to the coast, 
including the cities of Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Ventura, Camarillo and Moorpark, 
as well as small water companies, ranches and farms. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of the ordinance "will conserve more water and help control overdraft 
and seawater intrusion," Farnsworth said. He said it appears the board will 
approve the ordinance later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials have said that agricultural users would bear the brunt of the 
cutbacks. Well owners would become more dependent on outside water sources or 
be forced to cut their use. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old man has pleaded guilty to child molestation charges, and a 
25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a similar crime in the Thousand 
Oaks area, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio De Jesus Herrera, 21, pleaded guilty to charges of sodomy and oral 
copulation and will be sentenced at a later date, said Ventura County Sheriff's 
Detective Bill Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held at the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera befriended a 3-year-old boy on July 23 at an apartment complex at 1710 
W. Hillcrest Drive in Newbury Park, Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who does landscape work in the area, gave the child a bike ride to the 
back of the complex, where he molested the boy, Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, Martin Corona Reynosa, 25, was arrested on suspicion of 
lewd acts and penetration with a foreign object and was being held at the 
Ventura County Jail on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Reynosa was a guest at a house on Calle Pensamiento in Thousand Oaks when he 
molested a 5-year-old girl, Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested after attempting to run from officers at his house, Stovall 
said. CAROL WATSON

WEATHER SERVICE TO MOVE RADAR SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PITTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County is the perfect site for weather radar that will replace a system 
dating back to the 1950s, National Weather Service Meteorologist Art Lassard 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service plans to move from Los Angeles to Oxnard to 
install new state-of-the-art equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Sulphur Mountain, between Oxnard and Ojai, was picked as the perfect site for 
the system after a two-year survey by the government, Lassard said. 
</P>
<P>
The operations office will be built on a separate site within the Sammis 
Business Center between Rice and Del Norte roads. 
</P>
<P>
Both parcels need to be acquired before plans can be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
NEXRAD, an acronym for Next Generation Radar, will be installed nationwide in a 
modernizing effort by the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope that the office will be in operation by mid-1992 and will house 
about 28 electronic technicians, meteorologists and administrative assistants 
issuing weather forecasts for most of Southern California. LAURA PITTER

SHAKE-ROOF HOUSE DESTROYED IN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Thousand Oaks couple in their early 70s lost most of their shake-roof home in 
a fire Friday night after a hose broke on their propane barbecue grill, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Flames had consumed the home of Lowell and Bonnie Meachan at 3193 Camino 
Graciosa when firefighters arrived shortly after 6 p.m., said Alison Schember, 
spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. Damage was estimated at 
$100,000 to the house and $35,000 to the contents, Schember said. 
</P>
<P>
A motor home was moved from the driveway without damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 34 firefighters answered the call and extinguished the fire in about an 
hour, she said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: BOOT CAMP IN WAR OF THE SEXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeffrey Ball 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One by one they entered the classroom, 25 men who had loved and lost and who 
wanted more than anything else to love and win for a change. 
</P>
<P>
Silently, each man took an empty chair, and anxiously trying to look relaxed, 
occupied himself with a meaningless task to avoid making eye contact with those 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
They were a diverse lot. Some wore ties and some T-shirts; some were balding 
and some barely had begun to shave. 
</P>
<P>
But despite their different fashions and ages, they shared a common goal -- to 
learn, as the title of their for-men-only Pierce College seminar promised, "How 
to Treat a Woman." 
</P>
<P>
The source of the group's new knowledge would be Brenda Blackman, a blond 
former modeling teacher in a white decollete blouse, black high heels, and a 
red-and-black checked jacket decorated with a pin spelling "PARIS" in sparkling 
stones. 
</P>
<P>
After each student had paid his $25 fee -- free love went out of vogue in the 
Sixties, after all -- Blackman laid down a rule. 
</P>
<P>
"No taping, please," she advised the students, none of whom appeared to be 
planning to do any such thing. "I'm in the process of writing a book on this 
material, so I would like to have this information for my book." 
</P>
<P>
She started off with her qualifications as an expert on men, women and the 
combination of the two: former jewelry store owner, modeling teacher and 
"communications trainer" for a local self-help group. She has been divorced 
twice and her age is none of your business. 
</P>
<P>
She began teaching seminars in 1979 after continual hounding by clients who 
envied her business success, she said. Now, she teaches seminars full time, 
offering 19 courses, including a companion seminar to this one, for women only: 
"How To Be an Alluring, Captivating, Enticing Woman!" She wrote a book, "101 
Ways to Meet Your Lover," and appears on radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
But the would-be Valentinos from the Valley appeared likely to challenge the 
teaching abilities even of a Brenda Blackman. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he was there, one student lamented that "for some reason, most 
women are not interested in going out with me after the first date. I don't 
know what's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Another explained that he was "just here to find out about how the opposite sex 
works." 
</P>
<P>
A third revealed that "sometimes I'm uncomfortable about talking, not knowing 
what she's going to say back." 
</P>
<P>
A musician, emptying his soul to the rising uneasiness of those sitting near 
him, said that "what I'm after is getting in touch with my real feelings -- 
with the lying and the cheating." 
</P>
<P>
And a 17-year-old summer day camp counselor, half the age of most of his 
classmates, explained with a toothy grin, "I'm here to learn from you guys." 
</P>
<P>
The blind leading the blind. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for these hapless fellows, Blackman was armed with 150 minutes of 
insightful advice. "We'll see what we can do to help you," she repeated as each 
student recounted his womanizing woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Men need to be men and women need to be women," Blackman counseled them. "I 
know when I say this I get in trouble with feminists, but I say, 'Vive la 
difference!' " 
</P>
<P>
"Women love cologne," she said. "Get something that's really attractive to 
women. Cologne turns women on." 
</P>
<P>
Right. Never thought of that. 
</P>
<P>
"Wear clean underwear." 
</P>
<P>
Yup, that should knock'em dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Trim your ear and nose hair." 
</P>
<P>
(Does Tom Cruise know this stuff?) 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps the most secret wisdom of all: "Spitting in public is a no-no." 
</P>
<P>
(Hey, wait, you mean . . .? Wow, no wonder she washes her hair every night 
now.) 
</P>
<P>
She advised them that if they took care of themselves "as we'd like other 
people to take care of us, then we really do become our own best friend." (This 
may not have been all that helpful to a roomful of guys who are darn sick and 
tired of being their own best friend.) 
</P>
<P>
But Blackman was not simply a source of helpful dating hints. For a price that, 
according to Blackman, was no more than the expense of a small gift from 
Tiffany's, the men got a trenchant analysis of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
Blackman peppered her lecture with references to studies at Stanford and 
Harvard and with terms like "rejection-inducing behavior" and "neurolinguistic 
programming," all with a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
She referred to a public television documentary on the differences between male 
and female brains, asking if any students had seen it. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have," mumbled the only student wearing a tie pulled tight to his neck. 
A model of proper posture, he had been taking copious notes. He had three spare 
pens. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the process of looking for someone," he explained later. "I'm just out 
there trying to find my way." 
</P>
<P>
And who knows, perhaps Blackman's boot camp for the romantically backward will 
help him. 
</P>
<P>
But, as another student, an airline pilot, said during a break in the seminar, 
the tips are "appropriate for the beginning. But there's a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
But the pilot's skepticism didn't dampen his enthusiasm for Blackman's 
concluding exercise. He joined right in when she told the students to rise, 
pound their chests Tarzan-style, and bellow: "I'm a strong, sexy, masculine 
man." 
</P>
<P>
That should get the next date off to a running start.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK MINERS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I write to point out that your article, "A Gold Mining Slump Digs Into South 
Africa," which appeared in World Report (July 10), contained a number of 
factual errors. 
</P>
<P>
Firstly, to state that "little effort has been made to move blacks into the 
skilled trades" is simply devoid of truth. In the very short time since the 
removal of restrictive racial laws -- a development initiated and vigorously 
pursued by South Africa's private sector mining industry -- more than 6,000 
black employees have moved into skilled positions previously reserved by law 
for whites. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in a period of less than two years following the abolition of 
discriminatory legislation, an additional 600 blacks have been given the 
necessary training and awarded the so-called "blasting certificate," a 
qualification enabling them to move into the most senior positions in South 
African mining. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that the majority of black mine workers are migrants and that 
they are housed in single-sex hostels, it is incorrect to infer that a 
"prison-like atmosphere" prevails. No restriction is imposed on any employee's 
freedom of movement and the quality of accommodation provided is the envy of 
many other mining communities elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
That there are difficulties in the migrant labor system is common cause but the 
industry has long been mindful of these problems and has done much to ease or 
erase them. 
</P>
<P>
Your report also states that the average wage paid to black mine workers is 
$200. This is not true. The present average wage for unskilled and semi-skilled 
employees is in excess of R700 per month. At current exchange rates this 
amounts to more than $300 but you may be sure that R700 in South Africa has a 
great deal more purchasing power than $300 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In addition it is conservatively estimated that supplementary benefits enjoyed 
by employees (i.e., free food, accommodations, medical treatment and 
recreational facilities) are worth an additional R270 per month. 
</P>
<P>
I must also take exception to your reporter's allegations of racial inequities 
which he bases on the observation that whites are brought out of mines ahead of 
blacks at the end of a shift. 
</P>
<P>
For a number of reasons -- among them safety -- some measure of control is 
required in moving large numbers of people in and out of deep level mines and 
existing practice is founded not on racial criteria but on the basis of 
seniority. The most senior employees come out of the shaft first irrespective 
of race. 
</P>
<P>
At the present time the majority of senior positions are, indeed, occupied by 
whites but the rapidly changing skills profile of our black employees will soon 
dictate that considerable numbers of them will be returning to the surface 
ahead of many of their white colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The South African mining industry does not lay claim to perfection. We 
acknowledge our shortcomings. But now that we have jettisoned the iniquitous 
discriminatory laws that for so long impeded our optimal development we have 
moved with great speed and are a truly equal opportunity employers.

WHY ARE WE IN THE PERSIAN GULF?; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. IS THERE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anonymous Defense Department source is widely quoted as saying that 
contingency plans for the Persian Gulf "could result in the insertion of up to 
200,000 to 250,000 (U.S.) ground forces before it's all done." He goes on to 
warn that if American troops must do battle, it could lead to "warfare on a 
scale we haven't seen since World War II." These are sobering, not to say 
mind-boggling thoughts. Before they gain too much currency, it would be a good 
idea to freeze the frame and take a clear and realistic look at just what's 
being talked about. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Pentagon files do contain contingency plans for intervention on such a 
massive scale, probably dating back to President Carter's promise in 1979 to 
defend the Persian Gulf's oil supplies against outside -- at that time meaning 
Soviet -- aggression. But a contingency plan is just that, something the 
Pentagon routinely prepares in anticipation of plausible military requirements. 
A contingency plan is not a policy. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions about world events are best avoided, especially in an area as 
volatile as the gulf, but here's one anyway: Hundreds of thousands of American 
fighting men are not going to be put into the ferociously hostile environment 
of Saudi Arabia. That won't happen because (1) Congress would refuse to approve 
such a commitment; (2) the American people wouldn't support it; (3) the Saudis 
would not invite or tolerate it; (4) probably no senior military official would 
propose it, and finally, (5) President Bush, if for no other reason than that 
he faces reelection in 1992, would not request it. 
</P>
<P>
The President, for sound reasons, doesn't want to reveal his military options 
to Iraq; keeping an opponent guessing is a tactic as old as warfare itself. But 
Bush, who has so far played this crisis well, also has to be concerned about 
retaining public understanding and support for what he is trying to do. That 
support can fade very quickly under the impact of horror stories suggesting 
that 250,000 American troops could be sent to fight a long and brutal desert 
war. 
</P>
<P>
The President owes it to the American people to keep his policy clear, to 
explain it often and to prevent the challenge that is faced from being 
distorted. The Iraqi regime is ruthless and commands a large army with numerous 
weapons. But Iraq is not the military giant of popular impression. As one 
commentator put it so well, mowing down waves of suicidal Iranian teen-agers is 
one thing. Confronting a superpower like the United States is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his advisers ought to be making clear that the Arabian oil fields can 
be defended without involving American troops in an open-ended land war in the 
Persian Gulf. The key to defending Saudi Arabia and nearby smaller states is 
air and naval power. The United States has undoubted superiority in both areas; 
add the contributions coming from Britain, France, Australia, Canada and other 
maritime countries, and that superiority becomes overwhelming. There should be 
no hesitation in using this power not just to deter and repel, but to 
relentlessly punish any new Iraqi attack that would threaten vital world oil 
supplies. There need be no reluctance to use it to enforce the U.N.-sanctioned 
embargo of Iraq until Baghdad ends its occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Each day makes it more evident how disastrously Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 
misjudged the consequences of his aggression. Now his political isolation seems 
to have deepened even further. A dozen states of the 21-member Arab League have 
agreed to send military forces, the nature of which have yet to be decided, to 
support Saudi Arabia. That expressed intention by itself represents something 
of a watershed in inter-Arab relations. If it is acted upon, it promises to be 
a political event of singular importance.

SAVINGS AND LOAN CRISIS AND FREE MARKET FORCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So now our government technocrats are talking seriously about further 
deregulation of the banking system in this country. Just bear in mind that when 
the S&amp;Ls were deregulated under Jimmy Carter, our Congress lifted the FDIC 
insurance from $40,000 on deposits to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't know they had decided to gamble with our money. 
</P>
<P>
They say we must deregulate the banks if they are to remain competitive on an 
international level. So, OK, but let the banks buy their own insurance and pass 
the cost on to their big depositors. The majority of people in this country 
have less than $1,000 on deposit or in savings. Why, then, should we agree to 
back the big boys plays.

DEUKMEJIAN ON WORKFARE OBSTACLES AND BUDGET CUTS IN SOCIAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deukmejian's article illustrates how little he knows about the plight of the 
working mother raising children alone. He proposes that welfare mothers be 
required to take a job at the minimum wage or lose their benefits, rather than 
remaining in school to help them get a better job. 
</P>
<P>
This means that, working full-time, a mother would only earn about $700 a 
month, and bring home even less, after deductions. 
</P>
<P>
With rents in Los Angeles for a one bedroom apartment averaging $595 a month 
and child care costs at $200 to $400 a month, it only takes a little simple 
arithmetic to see that her family would be penniless and quite possibly 
homeless before she started her second month at work. As the director of a 
shelter for homeless women and children, I already see too many families 
struggling to survive on too little. The governor needs to sign up for one of 
workfare's remedial math programs that he'd like to cut back so that he can 
learn why his figures only add up to disaster.

DEUKMEJIAN ON WORKFARE OBSTACLES AND BUDGET CUTS IN SOCIAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Clear Away Obstacles to Workfare" (California Commentary, July 27), Gov. 
George Deukmejian asserts that the central purpose of the workfare program 
(GAIN -- Greater Avenues for Independence) is the "transferring (of) welfare 
checks into paychecks and dependency into opportunity for every Californian." 
The governor may indeed believe this, in which case he is deluding himself. 
</P>
<P>
For almost three decades now, the U.S. has pursued a policy to keep large 
numbers of people out of work in order to control inflation. Both major 
political parties and all Presidents have endorsed the "target" or "natural" 
rates of unemployment thought necessary for economic stability. In recent 
years, 6-8% unemployment has been repeatedly mentioned, and this translates to 
8 million involuntarily unemployed workers. Those who an find only part-time 
work and those who have just given up are not counted. There is nothing secret 
about the policy, but political leaders hesitate to publicly advertise their 
allegiance to silly economic theories. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of "independence" is also sham. Everyone who needs an employer's 
paycheck to maintain a standard of living is dependent upon that employer. For 
those on welfare, the government is the employer, and people should be paid 
decent wages for doing what the government tells them to do (remain 
unemployed). It is absurd to imply that they are "cheating" taxpayers.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER MISTAKENLY LEAVES SON BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father and son were reunited Friday at a truck stop in Gorman after the 
father inadvertently left the boy behind after making a stop on a trip from 
Sacramento to Santa Ana, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Van Eck was making the trip south when he stopped at 5:45 a.m. at a service 
station at the Gorman exit of the Golden State Freeway, said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy David Rawson. 
</P>
<P>
Van Eck's 12-year-old son, Jason, who had been sleeping under a blanket in the 
back seat, woke up while the father was in the service station office and left 
the car to go to a restroom. 
</P>
<P>
When the father came out of the service station, he thought his son was still 
asleep under the blanket and continued on his way to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Rawson said it was not until Van Eck arrived at his destination and went to 
wake his son that he realized the boy wasn't there. He immediately called the 
California Highway Patrol which connected him with sheriff's deputies who had 
been called to the service station to take custody of Jason. 
</P>
<P>
Rawson said Van Eck made it back to Gorman by 10:30 a.m. to pick up his son. He 
then had to turn around and drive back to Santa Ana.

LONG BEACH STUDENTS SCRAMBLE FOR REHEARSAL SPACE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: COLLAPSE OF UNIVERSITY HALL AND CLOSING OF OTHER BUILDINGS CREATE 
SHORTAGE. SITUATION FIGURES TO GET WORSE IN SEPTEMBER, TEACHERS PREDICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This fall, Cal State Long Beach music student Vickie Reed had planned to walk 
into the university's Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall and, before her family, 
friends and teachers, give a performance that would mark the culmination of 
years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she is now scrambling about town for a place with a concert grand 
piano and good acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the hall last month and the closing of five more 
buildings in the music complex last week, Reed is not the only student in 
search of a spot to play music. When classes begin Sept. 4, about 400 music 
students in the larger performing groups will be lugging instruments to local 
churches, the main library downtown and even the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really rather frantically trying to find rehearsal places," said Prof. 
Michael Carson, director of the university's opera program. "It's a huge 
crisis. You just can't imagine." 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching is just going to be a nightmare," added Prof. Edith Hirshtal, who 
teaches piano. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Para, music department chairman, said late last week that he is 
confident there will be enough teaching and rehearsal rooms found on and off 
campus before classes start. About a half-dozen churches have volunteered 
space, the downtown library will make room for musicians in its auditorium and 
the Queen Mary has offered a ballroom for a major opera production in November, 
Para said. 
</P>
<P>
"The community has been very supportive," said Prof. Richard Birkemeier, 
director of the Brass Ensemble. "You find out who your friends are when the 
going gets rough -- and it has gotten rough." 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the recital hall collapsed July 2. Normally used for rehearsals and 
performances, the hall was empty when 120 tons of concrete and steel crashed 
down. Officials immediately closed another rehearsal hall and a third building 
with faculty offices and a storage area for music equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the experts investigating the collapse of the recital hall decided 
to shut down five more buildings in the music complex, saying the 8-year-old 
structures would not withstand a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the hall's cave-in remains a mystery, but of equal mystery is why 
past inspections of the other buildings did not reveal the structural 
deficiencies that led to their closing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Para said many of the 3,000 music students who are not in the larger performing 
groups will be transferred to classrooms throughout campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we're going to have some difficulties in the fall. There'll be some 
confusion," Para said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the inconvenience of traveling across campus or to a nearby church 
will be problems posed by impromptu rooms not designed for music classes, Para 
and others said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they won't be practicing and rehearsing in places designed for 
music will be difficult," Para said. 
</P>
<P>
Pianists, for example, need larger rooms, said Hirshtal, the piano professor. 
</P>
<P>
She said practicing pianists have been left with just a few small rooms, in 
which most of the pianos are inadequate. When the roof of the hall collapsed, 
it came tumbling down on the two grand pianos that students had used to give 
their recitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to teach in those rooms," Hirshtal said about the small chambers. "You 
can't hear what you're doing. Some of those pianos are so bad that students 
call them 'piano-shaped objects.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reed, the student looking for a place to hold her senior recital, said of the 
practice rooms left: "It's like performing in a bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
Music student Esme Vera, another pianist, said she has been practicing six 
hours a day to prepare for her much-anticipated junior recital, originally 
scheduled next month. Now, she does not know where she will hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Hirshtal said she is "really worried about morale. These are not kids who are 
rich, like those at USC. They don't have wonderful pianos at home."

WEST HOLLYWOOD GAMBLES ON CARD CLUB INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, the West Hollywood City Council placed a gambling 
initiative on the November ballot, asking voters to decide whether the city 
should allow one legalized card club to operate within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which had been unanimous in its opposition to the measure, voted 
3-1 this week to hold the referendum anyway -- betting that the city's best 
chance to defeat the gambling initiative would come during the November general 
election, when more voters go to the polls than in other elections. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also predicted that the measure would have a hard time passing, 
saying it sets up a "special tax" and therefore requires a two-thirds vote for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the citizens in West Hollywood do not want to see gambling 
established here," said City Councilwoman Abbe Land. "So let's put it to a vote 
and show them this is not the type of establishment we want in this city." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the November referendum was welcome news to backers of the 
initiative, who had tried and failed to gather enough signatures in time to 
place an initiative on the November ballot. But they did collect more than 
enough to qualify a measure for the next municipal election in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted by the news, and we are ready to get started," proclaimed 
Philip Marks, a general partner of the Cavendish West Hollywood, a private 
bridge and rummy club that is sponsoring the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
City officials agreed to hold the election in November after proponents of the 
initiative said they did not want to wait until 1992 to hold a referendum and 
announced plans to launch another petition drive to get a measure on the ballot 
in April, 1991, when the community college election is expected to draw few 
voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be an election we could lose because most people don't show up," 
said Councilman Paul Koretz as he voted for the November initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The card club would be similar to clubs operating in Commerce and Bell Gardens, 
where legal card games such as draw poker are allowed but games of chance such 
as blackjack are prohibited. The clubs make their profit by renting table space 
to the players. Betting against the house is not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the initiative claim that the city could get from $5 million to 
$10 million annually from the club, roughly 10% of its estimated gross 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
A provision in the initiative that could spark some controversy requires that 
three-fourths of the revenue the city gets from the club must be earmarked for 
the elderly, law enforcement, gay and lesbian services, and revitalization of 
the city's east end, where the club would be located. The city would be allowed 
to use the remaining one-fourth at its discretion. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have described the provision as a special tax requiring the 
initiative to be approved by a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Decker, a spokesman for the West Hollywood Club Initiative Committee, 
said his group will fight that interpretation in court. "They are trying to 
roll a hand grenade under the door with this one, but it won't work. We'll file 
a lawsuit against them if they try to pull that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Decker said his group would wait until the city enforced the provision before 
filing a suit.

'RAT PACKS' OF ROBBERS HIT STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are young and brash, travel in large groups, and intimidate and harass 
store owners while walking off with their merchandise, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Police are warning Santa Monica merchants about such bands of youths, saying 
that in at least three recent instances, groups of as many as 40 teen-agers 
have swarmed into local stores in the afternoon and made off with hundreds, 
sometimes thousands, of dollars worth of sneakers and athletic wear. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities call it "rat-packing" and say it is a growing practice among gang 
members in other areas of Los Angeles County. In Hollywood, they say, several 
such robberies have occurred in recent weeks, sometimes targeting liquor and 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be the popular crime of the summer among juveniles," said Lt. 
Robert Thomas of the Santa Monica Police Department. "They go in and completely 
overwhelm the merchants, (who) are so intimidated they are afraid to take 
action against any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica stores are among the latest targets. But police said it is not 
clear whether the practice has spread from other areas, or if the local 
incidents have been isolated and the work of the same youths. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is anything that is that well organized," said Thomas. "But 
it has happened enough for us to be concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
Since July 23, at least two stores on Wilshire Boulevard have been hit, and 
Thomas said there may have been others. 
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested nine juveniles in two robberies of Athletic X-Press on 
Wilshire Boulevard -- four in connection with a July 23 robbery, and five more 
after a similar incident July 27. Some of the youths were caught as they 
changed into stolen clothes and sneakers a few blocks away, according to police 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
Some suspects also may have participated in a similar robbery of Brooks Shoes 
on Wilshire Boulevard, also on July 27, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
During the Athletic X-Press robberies, at least 20 youths charged into the 
store and headed for the clothing and sneakers, police said. Some of them had 
been there the Saturday before, looking around before stealing one pair of 
sneakers, said store owner Michael Dobbin. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just running in, picking stuff off the shelves and running out," 
Dobbin said. 
</P>
<P>
One employee immediately called police but Dobbin said no effort was made to 
stop the youths. "Are you nuts? I'm not going to take on that many kids. Not a 
chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the July 27 robbery at Athletic X-Press, one youth ripped a coatrack off its 
bearings and walked out of the store with the entire rack, with six jackets on 
it. Each jacket was worth about $100 and bore the insignia of the Los Angeles 
Lakers, Raiders or other popular sports teams, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of sneakers, apparently all Nike brand, also were stolen, and 
authorities believe at least $2,000 in merchandise was taken altogether. 
</P>
<P>
One Athletic X-Press employee said he "did not see a single juvenile exit the 
store without carrying store property in his hands" during one of the 
robberies, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they regarded the incidents as robberies rather than shoplifting 
because the youths were using intimidation and threats. The youths do not seem 
to be afraid of the store owners or the police, authorities said.

I don't care who you are, anyone can join the Junior Golf Assn. or many U.S.

Last night, my 7-year-old son came home from the baseball game bursting with 
pride because he witnessed Jose Canseco's back-to-back home runs. However, this 
morning I had to explain to him that we could not go to the autograph signing 
of Jose and other sports figures because of the exorbitant sums of money being 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
No, the money does not go to charity or to help any worthy organizations. It 
goes into the pockets of Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson and Steve Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that an autograph was an act of kindness, a social responsibility 
toward kids who worshiped them. Now it is a commodity and might as well be 
listed with pork bellies on the exchange.

JACK MATHEWS: THE PROBLEM WITH UNIVERSAL'S 'PROBLEM CHILD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The marketing staff at Universal Pictures must have had a lot of fun writing 
the blurbs for its ad campaign for "Problem Child" -- for about 10 minutes 
anyway. How long could it have taken to come up with such howlers as " 'Two 
Thumbs Up!' -- Captain Hook"? or " 'I Wish He Were My Son' -- Darth Vader"? or 
" 'A 10+! Junior Had Me in Stitches!' -- Frankenstein"? 
</P>
<P>
The gag blurbs are just about as inspired as the movie, so, in that sense, 
there is truth in advertising. And no one can say they haven't been effective; 
during its first 10 days in release, "Problem Child" picked willing American 
moviegoers' pockets for about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Universal has succeeded with "Problem Child" without the benefit of opening-day 
reviews or pre-release publicity. The movie was not screened in advance for 
critics, a decision that is the equivalent of an in-house pan, and the only 
publicity for it came from animal rights groups protesting its apparent abuse 
of cats. A poster for "Problem Child" showed a panicked cat whirling in a 
front-load dryer, and the trailer showed a cat walking gingerly on splintered 
broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
In both instances, the implication was that the movie's title character (the 
screenwriters dub the story a "comic 'Bad Seed' ") tortured cats as part of his 
general run of terror. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's anything funny about abusing animals," says Kathy 
Novelli, of San Francisco-based In Defense of Animals, which is planning more 
protests against "Problem Child." "Kids are very impressionable. They see a cat 
in a dryer and say, 'Hey, that's a great idea.' It's giving kids ideas they 
don't need." 
</P>
<P>
The dryer scene is not actually in the movie and never was, according to studio 
sources, which makes the marketing department guilty of deception as well as 
bad taste. Novelli says her group has been successful in getting some theaters 
to take down the poster, but check your local multiplex; the kitty-in-the-dryer 
poster is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
There is a cat shown in the movie high-stepping across a lawn with his paws 
bandaged (cats hate it when that happens) and among the millions of kids who 
are exposed to the sight gag, some will undoubtedly try it at home with Boots. 
A few, as Novelli fears, may even put theirs in a dryer. But this film could be 
doing much greater harm than that in its indirect exploitation of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Junior, a 7-year-old who had been shuffled from home to home is presented in 
the film as a satanic mischief-maker who is ultimately redeemed by the patience 
of the Super Dad (John Ritter) who adopts him. Along the way to salvation, 
however, Junior is the perfect devil -- setting fires, bombing birthday cakes, 
tormenting his cat, nearly killing his adoptive grandfather. (Are your sides 
aching yet?) 
</P>
<P>
It is a dark coincidence, and probably one reason why Universal dumped "Problem 
Child" on the market without preview press screenings, that HBO aired the 
documentary "Child of Rage" just weeks earlier. "Child of Rage" focused on an 
adopted girl named Beth who, her unsuspecting adoptive parents quickly learned, 
was self-destructive and homicidal. She tormented the family dog, killed some 
baby birds and attempted to kill her younger brother. In therapy, it was 
learned that she had been severely abused by her natural father and had come to 
believe that though she was not OK, her behavior was. 
</P>
<P>
"Hers was a serious case, but nothing about it was unusual," says Anne Cohn, 
executive director of the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, 
and a consultant on "Child of Rage." "Children who are abused most often will 
have a tremendous rage and sense of insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn says she is "appalled" at the theme of "Problem Child" and thinks the 
flipness with which people approach child abuse is doing harm by suggesting the 
behavior depicted is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reminded of a little cartoon on an air-freshener package showing (Bart) 
Simpson being strangled by his father," Cohn says. "It's meant to be funny, but 
the strangling of children by their parents (occurs) and it's not funny." 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, there's a scene in "Problem Child" where the fed-up adoptive dad 
slips into Junior's room at one point and briefly considers smothering him with 
a pillow. It gets a big laugh every time. 
</P>
<P>
Cohn puts "Problem Child" in a class with the popular TV show "America's 
Favorite Home Videos," which she says seems to encourage child abuse. "People 
think these videos are hilarious, but what they often show are parents setting 
their children up for disaster. Humor can help us make light of ourselves, but 
I don't think that's what ('Problem Child') is doing. It's making fun of a 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Ryan, a child psychologist in San Francisco, says that children often 
abuse pets because in exercising control over something that can't fight back 
it fills -- in a false way -- a need for power. She's concerned that "Problem 
Child" can be suggesting that kind of behavior to abused children. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing that abuse taken lightly gives permission to behave the same way; it 
idealizes it," Ryan says. "Children don't see the finality of things. Imagine 
the guilt they would feel if they put an animal in a dryer and it was harmed or 
died." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts in adoption services fear the fallout from the film's suggestion 
that adopting older children is more of a risk than it actually is. The 
majority of older adopted children are, in fact, abused children, and, if the 
problems aren't worked out, these experts agree, the kids do internalize guilt 
and often express it as acted-out rage. But they say these problems have been 
worked through before a child is put up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment, a production company that had 
courted an image as a maker of family theme films before this dubious 
enterprise, were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
And, by the way, for those who think the movie rating system works, "Problem 
Child" is rated PG.

FACES . . . : JOIE LEE, SPIKE'S SISTER, FINDS HERSELF IN A 'MO' BETTER' PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joie Lee grew up in Brooklyn, the only girl in a family of six children. "I 
considered myself one of the boys," she says. "My brothers didn't spoil me at 
all, not at all. I was very tomboyish. It wasn't as if I was like a princess or 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing tomboyish now about the 28-year-old actress who currently is 
starring in her big brother Spike Lee's new film, "Mo' Better Blues." She plays 
Indigo Downes, one of two beautiful women in the life of jazz musician Bleek 
Gilliam (Denzel Washington). 
</P>
<P>
Lee and her siblings were encouraged from childhood to go into the arts. Her 
father is a jazz musician who scores the music to Spike's films; her mother was 
a schoolteacher. "It was just our way of life," she says. "When you grown up in 
that kind of environment, it's not something you question. When you are a 
youngster, I think most kids want to do what their parents do. We lived and 
breathed (the arts). It wasn't anything that was oppressive." 
</P>
<P>
Education was also very important in her family. "My mother passed away when I 
was 14, so there were certain things I missed in terms of upbringing," says 
Lee. "Maybe my mother would have said, 'You have to get a real job.' I don't 
know because I didn't have that experience. My fortes in school were Spanish, 
sports, reading and theater. That's what they encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
After attending a private school for gifted students for 12 years, Lee dropped 
out of Sarah Lawrence College during her sophomore year. "I wasn't ready for 
school," admits Lee. "It was more important to me to have a job or have an 
apartment or have a boyfriend. That's what I wanted to experience at that 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Lee worked at various odd jobs until four years ago when Spike gave her a small 
part in his first feature film, "She's Gotta Have It." "Acting is something I 
always wanted to do and knew I could do," says Lee. She's subsequently worked 
with her brother on all of his features and is about to begin his new movie, 
"Jungle Fever." 
</P>
<P>
Between acting assignments, Lee hopes to find time to complete her education. 
"I want to have a degree," says Lee. " It wasn't important at 18 when you are 
flitting about, but it's important to me now. I want to finish school." SUSAN 
KING

REACTIONS TO THE FALL OF 'MISS SAIGON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A generation ago, the Rev. Marin Luther King Jr. called on the world not to 
judge individuals by the color of their skin but by the contents of their 
minds. Ironically, the success of the civil rights movement in redressing 
discrimination has created an environment of color consciousness in which an 
individual is pegged into a specific racial or ethnic category. 
</P>
<P>
We have become so fixated with color that we jump to the conclusion that 
because a person is of a certain race, he or she possesses attributes of that 
race and cannot break through the genetic traits. We discount the contents of a 
person's mind. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, we deny the humanity we all share by focusing on superficial 
aspects. We become hostages of tokenism. 
</P>
<P>
More faith should be placed in the possibility that people from different 
backgrounds and ethnicities can empathize and portray each other on the stage. 
If we lose this faith, we will have lost much of the promise of a society that 
once aspired to treat every individual equally without regard to race, creed 
and color.

FACES . . . : THOMERSON'S SERIOUS ABOUT ACTING BUT HE'S CRAZY ABOUT SURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm telling you," says Tim Thomerson, "it's like the bitchin'-est thing you 
can ever do. It's pretty close to sex." 
</P>
<P>
Thomerson, who plays Babo, Mel Gibson's sidekick in the just-released film "Air 
America," isn't talking about acting. He's actually discussing one of his 
favorite non-work-related pastimes. Besides being an avid runner and skier -- 
"kind of a fitness head," as he puts it, Thomerson's been a surfing disciple 
since the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"You're out in the water, there's not anybody around you, your old lady's not 
yelling at you. . . ," he says of his sport. "I really like to work, I enjoy 
what I do -- and I also like my down time." 
</P>
<P>
From the sound of it, Thomerson hasn't had much down time lately. In the past 
15 months, he's had roles in "Hunter," "21 Jump Street," "Young Riders" and 
"Major Dad," to name a few. His part in "Air America" sent him to the jungles 
of Asia for four months -- not a lot of surfing there, but Thomerson found 
other diversions. 
</P>
<P>
"I went diving in the gulfs off Thailand," he says. "I spent some time 
traveling around. Location work can be what you make it." 
</P>
<P>
He may enjoy his leisure time, but for Thomerson, a former stand-up comic who 
has also starred in the sci-fi satire "Trancers" and in "Uncommon Valor," 
acting is serious business. He studied for four years with Stella Adler in New 
York and recommends actors get some kind of schooling before they start out. 
"If you make the choice to be an actor, you should find a craft -- a technical 
way of working -- meaning when you get a script, you should look into that 
script and see how it works," he explains. "You'd better know what you're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Now that "Air America" is ready to roll, Thomerson certainly knows what he 
wants to do next. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I want to do? I want to go surfing," he answers, without hesitation.

THEY GET MESSAGE ACROSS IN A BIG WAY; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. FESTIVAL: THREE ARTISTS TAKE AN ADVERTISING TOOL -- THE OUTDOOR BILLBOARD 
-- TO CONVEY DIFFERENT MESSAGES AT SELECTED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The artworks by three local artists -- Erika Rothenberg, Sandra Rowe and John 
Baldessari -- go public Monday on billboards across the city, commissioned as 
part of Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of feminist artist Rothenberg, this means a 14 x 48-foot parody of 
inaccurate advertising messages. 
</P>
<P>
Her billboard, which will be at the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Hatteras 
Avenue in Van Nuys, will feature a drawing of a "typical American family" 
consisting of a husband, wife, two children and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
Blazoned across their freshly-scrubbed, blue-eyed all-American faces (even the 
family dog has blue eyes) in bold colorful letters reads, "There are still 
homes in the U.S. that consist of a husband who works, a housewife and two 
kids!" 
</P>
<P>
But to drive her point home, in the lower right hand corner, Rothenberg cites 
the actual number of such American families existing: only 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ideal that doesn't exist," Rothenberg said. "It's surprising because I 
think most people might say 60% of all American families are this ideal, but 
even if it was a family with just one child instead of two, that statistic is 
still only 10%." 
</P>
<P>
Americans base legislation on such false images, she says, and "few of us are 
living up to these images. Most of us are have-nots. There is a certain 
satisfaction in knowing that this perfection pounded into us does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how people are going to take (the billboard). Hopefully, it will 
make people realize they are not alone and in fact, they are in the majority." 
</P>
<P>
Originally from New York, Rothenberg herself is one of the "have-nots." 
Although married with a youngster at home, she is a full-time working mother. 
"These are my opinions. Hopefully others will bring their opinions into it 
too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Los Angeles Festival committee members place any restrictions on the 
message for her billboard art? 
</P>
<P>
"None," she says. "Perhaps they were crossing their fingers that I would not be 
completely disgusting as I can be. However, they did know I would be 
provocative." 
</P>
<P>
Along with her billboard for the Festival, Rothenberg will be featured Sept. 
4-23 at the Soap Plant, 7400 Melrose Ave. in Hollywood, as part of the Open 
Festival, a concurrent part of Los Angeles Festival but on in which artists 
have funded their work themselves. She will have a window display titled "Have 
You Attacked America Today?" 
</P>
<P>
Initially shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City, and 
initially funded by Art Matters, an East Coast organization that supports 
controversial artwork, the display also satirizes American advertising. 
Rothenberg says there is not enough dissent in present-day American society. 
Thus viewers see her dissent-laced designs for everyday household products that 
one might find on the shelves at the supermarket, including items like 
"flag-burning kits" and "protest pills." 
</P>
<P>
Space for the three billboards was donated by the Patrick Media Group after 
demographic and marketing research on the locations. Peter and Eileen Norton 
have underwritten the project with a $25,000 grant. Rothenberg is among artists 
represented in the Nortons' private collection. "She is very interesting in her 
social commentary," Peter Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Rothenberg's San Fernando Valley site, an abstract billboard by 
Baldessari will be installed Monday at Santa Monica and La Brea and Rowe's work 
featuring two eyeless human faces covered in lines over the message "You Are 
the Future" will be completed at Crenshaw and El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Baldessari has been out of town and unavailable for comment but Rowe said she 
hopes people will view her figures as having no particular race or sex, rather 
as symbols of themselves: Individuals taking responsibility for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Most billboard advertising assumes people have an indirect, passive role," the 
Cal State Pomona art professor said. "I hope that my 'You' will talk to people 
and have them ask who, what and how."

ARCADIA RESIDENTS UNAWARE OF ARBORETUM FESTIVAL PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arcadia residents whose properties adjoin the L.A. State and County Arboretum 
have not been notified that the Los Angeles Festival plans to hold an all-night 
performance by a 67-member Javanese dance company in their back yards, even 
though the city of Arcadia and the arboretum have sought neighbors' approval in 
the past for events running later than 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And while the San Gabriel Valley city has yet to formally approve the Sept. 8 
event, hundreds of tickets have already been sold. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with 19 residents of the three dozen homes bordering the 127-acre 
park, not one was aware that any L.A. Festival events were planned for the 
arboretum, much less the "Wayang Kulit" shadow puppet play by the Court 
Performers from the Jogjakarta Palace of Java. The event is scheduled from 10 
p.m. to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 15 festival performances -- featuring the Javanese court dancers, 
Cambodian Classical Dance Troupe, Uwanuda Kagura Troupe from Japan and Majikina 
Honryu Okinawan Dance Company -- are scheduled at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that I haven't heard anything about (the all-night event) -- 
we're getting pretty close to it, so it'd be nice if they'd let us know. I'm 
concerned enough that I'm going to make a call over there to look into this," 
said Suzanne Tomkins, a resident on North Old Ranch Road who has shared her 
back yard with the arboretum for 10 years and has lived her entire life in the 
affluent Arcadia neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Tomkins, like most of the residents interviewed, had mixed feelings about the 
event: She didn't want to be kept awake all night, but since it was a 
one-night-only affair, she might consent if the arboretum assured her that 
strict noise controls would be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
While final contracts between the festival and the arboretum were scheduled to 
be signed Friday, tickets for the outdoor events, which were originally 
scheduled for the downtown Embassy Theater, have been on sale for more than a 
month. According to a Ticketron agent, only 300 tickets for "Wayang Kulit" are 
still available for the 800-seat venue. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Arnold, acting director of the arboretum, said city officials have told 
him that he must get signed permission from all residents bordering on the park 
before the event is held. 
</P>
<P>
But three neighbors interviewed by The Times said they would not consent and 
several others were undecided. In addition, at least three homes affected have 
ailing residents who would would not be likely to approve, the neighbors said.

BUDGET DEFICIT MAY NECESSITATE L.A. FESTIVAL CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Festival may cut some of its 230 scheduled programs by the end of 
next week if its $4.7-million budget for the Sept. 1-16 arts extravaganza is 
not met, executive director Judith Luther said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible," Luther said when asked of the cuts. She added, however, "I 
think it's very likely that the money could come in. We've got a lot of things 
pending that could come in very quickly. If (all the funding requests) we've 
got out came in, we'd be home free." 
</P>
<P>
Festival board members contacted Tuesday confirmed that they had issued a 
mandate that there be "absolutely no deficit" from the upcoming event, which is 
still approximately $200,000 short of its $4.7 million goal. In addition to 
that shortfall -- which takes into account a projected $600,000 in ticket 
revenue -- the board is considering whether to reject a $30,000 National 
Endowment for the Arts grant that has been figured into the gala's budget for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
"The decisions on all of these things will have to be made by next week at the 
latest," Luther said, noting that not all board members had cast their votes on 
the NEA grant yet. But, she said, "right now, it seems to me that people are 
leaning toward signing (the NEA-required anti-obscenity oath) and accepting the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Although Luther had previously said that any program cuts would come from 
groups whose contracts were not yet finalized, she said the festival would now 
look to "making incremental cuts" such as canceling one or two performances by 
groups that were scheduled to do several shows. She would not speculate, 
however, on which groups might be affected and whether free or ticketed events 
would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would be decided by the festival's staff and would not require 
approval by the board, she said. But two board members interviewed thought they 
would be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could do it another way, we would do it another way," Luther said. "But 
we're pretty far along now with most of our contracts. It makes more sense to 
go in with fewer programs (for each group). But there are probably about a 
dozen questions that we would have to consider in deciding which events (to 
cut)." 
</P>
<P>
Festival general manager Michael Vargas said this week that he does not yet 
have signed contracts from "about 10 groups" but he would not identify all of 
them. Both Luther and Vargas, however, acknowledged that the participation of 
one group -- the Wallis and Futuna Music and Dance troupe -- was up in the air 
because of visa problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be a glitch there," Vargas said, explaining that negotiations were 
difficult because of the Polynesian group's remote island location. "They might 
not be able to get their visas in time," he said, referring to Luther's 
deadline to book reduced advance airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The Wallisians are scheduled for several free performances at various locations 
as well as a Sept. 5 ticketed program at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Another group that has yet to sign its contract is the 32-member Cambodian 
Classical Dance Troupe, which has not received U.S. State Department approval 
to visit because the U.S. government does not recognize the current Cambodian 
government. Luther said earlier that her staff will consider canceling the 
Cambodians' scheduled Sept. 13-16 performances if they are not granted visas by 
Friday.

LUCAS' NEXT MOVIE: TUSKEGEE AIRMEN; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: 'RED TAILS,' THE STORY OF THE BLACK PILOTS IN WORLD WAR II, WILL BE 
VIRTUALLY AN ALL-BLACK PROJECT. SAID LUCAS: 'I'M ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT CAN 
GET THIS FILM MADE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
George Lucas, creator of six of the top-grossing films in Hollywood history, 
says nearly all of his films were "commercial longshots." None more so than 
"Red Tails," a virtually all-black picture based on the story of the Tuskegee 
Airmen -- a black fighter squadron awarded a Presidential Unit Citation during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' new project is a groundbreaker of sorts. Unlike films such as "Cry 
Freedom" and "Glory," the story will be told through the black pilots 
themselves -- not through the eyes of white protagonists. And, in an industry 
frequently short on affirmative action, two blacks with minimal feature film 
experience will write and produce. Though no director is yet in place, another 
black -- Emmy-nominated Thomas Carter (TV's "Equal Justice" and "Midnight 
Caller") -- is the acknowledged frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
Budgeted at $25 million-$30 million, "Red Tails" is scheduled to go into 
preproduction in the fall and start shooting in the spring. It will be the 
first picture in a long-term deal Lucas will be cutting with a studio yet to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure to encounter resistance," Lucas said in a telephone interview, "but 
I'm one of the few people that can get this film made. I see the movie less as 
a race picture than as an aerial action adventure. 'Top Gun' proved there's an 
audience for that." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas challenges the notion that the film is a departure from his previous 
work: a U-turn in the wake of "Star Wars' " fantasy and "Indiana Jones' " 
tongue-in-cheek. "Strip away all the facade and it's the same story in all my 
movies: people relying on their intelligence and wit to overcome great 
obstacles," he said. "I've always been drawn to underdogs and intrigued by the 
relationship between man, machine, and excellence." 
</P>
<P>
The elements of drama are certainly in place. In 1940, Congress ordered the 
Army Air Corps (later to become the U.S. Air Force) to lift its color ban. 
During a four-year period, 926 blacks were trained at Alabama's Tuskegee Army 
Flying School. Though their service weren't sought out by military brass, an 
all-black squadron was eventually deployed to North Africa and Italy, where 
they served as escorts for white bomber pilots. Trashing the belief that blacks 
were not intelligent enough to fly, it went on to become one of the best 
fighter groups around -- flying 1,578 missions without losing a bomber along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Called "The Black Redtail Angels" (alluding to the red paint on the back of 
their planes) by admiring white colleagues, the Airmen returned home with 
honors -- only to confront the indignities of segregation from which they were 
insulated mid-air. "Overnight, they went from heroes to second-class citizens," 
said the screenwriter Kevin Sullivan, a TV producer/director/writer ("Frank's 
Place," "Night Watch") who has never before written a feature film that was 
produced. "It's a story that somehow got lost in our history books." 
</P>
<P>
The veterans formed Tuskegee Airmen Inc. in 1972 and, two years later, set up a 
committee to bring their story to the screen. Despite more than 100 feelers 
over the years, nothing ever took off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a period piece which is expensive to begin with -- and all the planes add 
to the cost," said producer Charles Floyd Johnson, a TV veteran ("Magnum P. 
I.," "Rockford Files") working on his first feature film. "Add in the fact that 
it deals with blacks and it was too much of a liability." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby Westbrook, 68, who flew 60 missions for the Tuskegee unit, wasn't 
surprised. "Hollywood has taught a lot of American history erroneously," he 
charged. "Its big omissions and stereotypical images have contributed to the 
development of a lot of false ideas. This was just business-as-usual." 
</P>
<P>
Enter George Lucas, informed about the squadron by a photographer friend in the 
mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I let it sit awhile," Lucas said, "but two years ago I realized it wouldn't 
leave my brain. Like 'Tucker' (on which Lucas was executive producer) it's a 
story too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan researched the topic for six months, talking with 14 of the Airmen 
before sitting down to write.

A STROLL AROUND DOWNTOWN L.A. SHOWS OFF ITS UBIQUITOUS HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND 
REVEALS CULTURAL RICHNESS AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY.

Walk east in Los Angeles along First Street on a Sunday morning and you find 
Japanese Buddhists worshiping in the ornate Nishi Hongwanji Temple, while over 
in the heart of Olvera Street, Latin rhythms waft from "La Placita," a 
well-known sanctuary for people from Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
To the northeast in Lincoln Heights, Latino and Asian cultures meld, and so do 
the churches: Primera Iglesia del Nazareno stands next door to the Chinese 
Assembly of God. And to the west in Angelino Heights stands Bethel Temple, 
which boasts two "English" pastors plus one Spanish, one Chinese and one Gypsy. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, stately St. Vibiana Cathedral rises next to rescue missions where a 
never-ending line of the homeless wait for food and, as dusk approaches, a 
place on the sidewalk to spend the night in a "cardboard condo." 
</P>
<P>
These are just a fraction of the more than 50 places of worship I discovered 
within a short radius of City Hall. I recently moved from the suburbs to a 
high-rise apartment on the edge of Chinatown. An unexpected benefit has been 
savoring the city's cultural richness and ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
What I discovered on a recent Sunday morning walk forms the basis for the first 
of an occasional series that will examine the scores of religions in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The stories will focus on issues, the history of denominations or sects, or 
profiles of worshipers and clergy. Above all, the articles will seek to capture 
the heartbeat of faith that makes religion a vital force in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
As I passed by, the signs on more than a few places of worship gave mute 
testimony to the changes immigration is making upon the city. Chinese writing 
on a typical Protestant church with Western-style stained glass windows, for 
example. A diversity of religions, with a strong Eastern flavor in some 
neighborhoods, Latino influences in others. 
</P>
<P>
Some religious groups are well-known, others obscure. Many belong to 
well-established national or international denominations, others are 
independent or ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered who belongs to some of these churches, what problems the members 
face and how rituals are conducted, say, for Sikhs, Jains and Bahais. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And interspersed among the "standard" Baptists and Lutherans and Catholics, I 
came upon some -- like the Holy Superet Church and Prayer Garden on West 3rd 
Street -- that defy categorization. 
</P>
<P>
At 243 1/2 East 5th street I found the Good News Chapel, a tiny Skid Row 
storefront crouched behind a folding metal security gate. Inside, transients 
slouched in semi-darkness. Signs posted in the window announced, "God's Word is 
a Treasure," and "Hugs, not Drugs." 
</P>
<P>
If this chapel is an example of the minuscule, walking to the corner of Flower 
and Olympic gives you the mammoth. Here stands First United Methodist Church in 
a multistory building that also houses the Methodist district offices and such 
diverse organizations as the Antioch Connection (a religious group for young 
Koreans) and Jericho Education for Justice (a Catholic lobby group for 
housing). 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks to the north on Flower is Our Lady Chapel, next to the Catholic 
Information Center. Downtown workers will also find a Catholic presence and 
frequent weekday Masses in the bowels of the Arco Towers: Ensconced in a corner 
of "C" level underground is well-appointed St. Bernardine Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
As the city has changed and populations have shifted, inner-city churches have 
struggled to adapt and maintain viable congregations. Some haven't made it. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, long a landmark at Wilshire and Figueroa, fell 
to the wrecker's ball in 1980. The congregation moved to the chapel in Good 
Samaritan Hospital, then merged with historic St. Athanasius and St. Paul 
Church overlooking Echo Park Lake. That 88-year-old parish has itself moved 
twice and will be moved again soon to make room for the new Episcopal Diocese 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The First Evangelical Covenant Church, a 100-year-old congregation originally 
composed of Swedes who populated what is now Bunker Hill, will disband early 
next year. Recently the temporary home of the First Korean Methodist Church, 
First Covenant also spawned a Spanish-language Covenant church that has moved 
to Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"We illustrate the plight and the flight of downtown," declared church worker 
R. W. Stayboldt. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of the Open Door with its landmark "Jesus Saves" signs is also gone 
from downtown Hope Street, thriving instead in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
But while some have moved out, others have stayed on or moved in. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south on Hope Street is feisty R. L. Hymers' Fundamentalist Baptist 
Tabernacle and something named the "Fundamentalist Christian Bookstore and KJV 
(King James Version) Bibles" -- what I imagine is an uneasy neighbor to the "I 
Am Accredited Sanctuary and Reading Room" of the metaphysical St. Germaine 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Now near Elysian Park and the Los Angeles River, the Young Nak (Korean) 
Presbyterian Church moved last year from the Fairfax district to a large new 
complex. Observing the bustle of activity as a fleet of buses shuttles 
worshipers on Sunday mornings, it's easy to see why Young Nak is considered one 
of the fastest-growing churches in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Gene Scott, the iconoclastic television minister, for a time held 
services at the downtown Church of the Open Door, but his purchase deal fell 
through in 1986 amid court battles. After moving his flock back to Wescott 
Christian Center in Glendale, Scott returned this year to the 1,800-seat United 
Artists Theater on Broadway. Scott spent $2 million renovating the classic 
movie house, which he now calls University Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland is also home base for several denominations: The Calvary Chapels 
and the Vineyard Fellowship are Orange County-based networks of charismatic 
churches extending outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 congregations of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship, founded by 
the Rev. John Wimber, a charismatic pastor in Yorba Linda, feature 
freewheeling, "praise-service" worship and close disciplining of members. 
</P>
<P>
The International Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches is the 
far-flung group of homosexual-oriented churches started in the late 1960s by 
the Rev. Troy Perry in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The United Church of Religious Science is also based in Los Angeles, and the 
Worldwide Church of God is headquartered in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
And the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, organized by Aimee 
Semple McPherson in 1927, is an offspring of her famed Angelus Temple near Echo 
Park Lake. The Rev. Jack Hayford's "Church on the Way" in Van Nuys is a 
nationally known Foursquare Church that represents a maturing of the older 
pentecostal style popular in the earlier McPherson days. 
</P>
<P>
I am also intrigued by the polyglot religions I found within an easy walk of 
our apartment: the upstairs Buddhist shrine of Pho Da Son Quan Am Po Tat Tu, 
Inc., on North Broadway; St. Peter-Italian Catholic Church and school a few 
doors down Broadway on the edge of Chinatown, and Croatian St. Anthony Catholic 
Church at the corner of North Grand and Alpine Street. 
</P>
<P>
That such a religious mosaic should flourish is remarkable and deserves a 
closer look.

MUSLIMS CONDEMN KUWAIT INVASION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Islamic Center of Southern California condemned the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait this week as "alien" to Muslim principles. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Maher Hathout, spokesman for the center, said Iraq may couch its goals in 
religious language but "there is no Islam in that mess. The Islamic stand, as 
stated in the Koran, is quite clear that disputes should not be solved by 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
Salam Al-Marayati, spokesman for the Muslim Political Action Committee in Los 
Angeles, said, "It is a very common tactic in the Muslim Middle East for 
dictators to exploit Islam to maintain power." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Mohammed T. Mehdi, Iraqi-born president of the National Council on 
Islamic Affairs, also condemned the Iraqi invasion as violating Islamic 
principles.

STUDY DISCOUNTS HARE KRISHNA 'MIND CONTROL'; 
</P>
<P>
SECT: DEVOTEES TEND TO BE COMPULSIVE, BUT MENTAL HEALTH IS OTHERWISE COMPARABLE 
TO OTHER GROUPS, PSYCHOLOGISTS FIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new study of Hare Krishna devotees in the United States indicates that they 
tend to be compulsive personalities -- meticulous people at ease with demanding 
rituals -- but their mental health is otherwise comparable to people in 
traditional American religions. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some anti-cult literature, "no evidence of deleterious 
psychological effects was generally found" in longtime members of the Hindu 
sect, two Southern California psychologists concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical psychologist Arnold S. Weiss of Culver City and Richard H. Mendoza, 
associate professor at the California School of Professional Psychology, 
reported their findings in the summer issue of the Journal for the Scientific 
Study of Religion. 
</P>
<P>
The psychologists gave two personality tests in the mid-1980s to 226 volunteers 
who had averaged eight years in the Hare Krishna movement. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said the findings have favorable implications for unconventional 
religious movements accused of using "mind control" techniques to keep their 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
The robed, chanting Hare Krishnas were a common sight in the 1970s soliciting 
donations for religious books at airports and street corners. But as internal 
strife, legal troubles and violent episodes escalated during the 1980s, U.S. 
membership has steadily declined. Devotees living in U.S. ashrams number 600, 
said one official. 
</P>
<P>
The movement faces financial disaster, its leaders say, because five temples 
may have to be sold to satisfy a $5-million court judgment in Orange County, 
including interest. In that case, ex-devotee Robin George said she was 
"brainwashed" and held by "coercive persuasion" by the sect when she was an 
adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 jury agreed with George's charges and rendered a $32-million judgment, 
but a state appeals court in 1989 rejected the brainwashing arguments and 
reduced the award to an amount reflecting the emotional distress experienced by 
Robin George's parents. The California Supreme Court last December let the 
appeals court decision stand, but the Krishna movement filed an appeal this 
year with the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he contributed to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion's 
brief submitted to the California Supreme Court as part of the George case. The 
brief disputed testimony which backed claims of brainwashing in the Hare 
Krishna movement. 
</P>
<P>
Expert opinions on sectarian religious movements have been sharply divided. 
Members of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, an academic 
association of sociologists and psychologists interested in religious behavior, 
have typically found that new religious movements are not as abnormal and 
devious as depicted by anti-cult organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of Weiss and Mendoza were questioned by Tarzana psychiatrist John 
Hochman, who is also assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The Hare Krishnas, who have had several leaders in trouble with the law, are "a 
very authoritarian group," Hochman said. He suggested that volunteers could 
have been told to give the right answers to one of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who may not be functioning very well, but deny it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Hare Krishna spokesman praised the findings. "If compulsive behavior 
means having the ability to get things done and adhere to goals, I would 
agree," said sect spokesman Mukunda, who lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, ex-devotee Lori Muster, a former associate editor in Southern 
California for the movement's international newspaper, said the study 
accurately described devotees. Although she said she quit the sect after 
becoming disenchanted with infighting among sect leaders, she said, "I got a 
lot out of my experience as a member." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss and Mendoza wrote in the journal that they attempted to discover whether 
Hare Krishnas' mental health and personalities "are adversely affected by 
greater degrees of involvement, or acculturation," in the movement. 
</P>
<P>
They were surprised, they wrote, that the hallmark trait of the Hare Krishna 
devotees was compulsive behavior. They said this trait was probably one that 
devotees had when they joined and may have enabled them to adjust to the 
faith's rigorous lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
As with other compulsive personalities, Weiss said when interviewed, "Devotees 
tend to be highly organized, neat, ritualistic, driven to complete tasks, feel 
compelled to correct errors and often fall prey to obsessive behavior. Many 
have learned early in life that love and approval are contingent upon 
exhibiting appropriate conforming behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Hindu sect's religion is to please the deity Krishna, Weiss 
said. "The more you perform required rituals and organized activities, such as 
early-morning chanting, the closer you will get to Krishna," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The study also said that personalities of Hare Krishna women tended to resemble 
those of American women who chose to be homemakers and mothers during the start 
of the feminist movement in the 1960s. Because the sect's tenets require them 
to be homemakers, the psychologists said that women who rebelled against that 
role probably dropped out early.

GRAPHIC DESIGN BLESSED BY TECHNOLOGY

<TEXT>
<P>
Poetic, intuitive and futuristic, April Greiman's graphic designs are in a 
league of their own. Known for her pioneering computer-generated work, the Los 
Angeles artist plucks imagery from hither and yon and sprinkles them into 
commercial posters in editions of hundreds or thousands. Characteristically, 
they manage to convey useful information at a glance while looking deliciously 
spacey. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 poster for a lighting-and-furniture emporium, the head of a marble 
Greek god seems to be inspecting the underside of a long-legged halogen lamp, 
and a blurred foot seems to be under the spell of a mysterious pyramidal 
object. The center of the design is a white-hot oval glow on a yellow 
background -- as if the viewer were peering blindly into a high-tech light 
bulb. 
</P>
<P>
A graceful open hand, palm up, is a recurrent symbol of creativity. It appears 
in posters for a design conference in San Francisco (1987) and an architecture 
school (1990), two of the clients in creative fields who apparently give 
Greiman free rein to juggle somersaulting words, confettilike dot patterns, 
multilayered photographic imagery, disingenuously quirky symbols and even 
teasingly private asides. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, her poster for the 1984 Olympics is plain-Jane stuff: the crisply 
shadowed legs of a woman runner in red trunks leaping from a square of bright 
blue sky to a Pepsodent-tinted greensward. It's vivid, all right, and a nice 
reminder of women's role in athletics, but Greiman seems to have throttled down 
to a bland common denominator of taste. 
</P>
<P>
Composing on the computer means being able to erase or redraw parts of a design 
with ridiculous ease; the hard part is knowing how to control the blizzard of 
possibilities at one's fingertips. For Greiman -- who also incorporates fax and 
video imagery into her work -- technology's blessings make possible a new kind 
of creative space replacing old-fashioned hierarchies that separate 
photographic image, typographic design and text. Looking at her work, one 
wonders idly what eccentric marvels the Bauhaus designers might have devised 
with a Macintosh.

A murder suspect who peppered his trial with outbursts, an attack on his 
attorney and phone calls to jurors from his jail cell has been convicted of 
killing a 23-year-old Castro Valley woman. Michael Huggins, 25, handcuffed and 
shackled, sat impassively as the jury verdict was read Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ann Lees was shot in the back in her remote Bollinger Canyon home in 
March, 1986, by Huggins, who had escaped from a nearby California Youth 
Authority work party the day before. Huggins faces either the death penalty or 
life in prison without the possibility of parole when the jury reconvenes for 
the penalty phase Aug. 20. Huggins drew the ire of Judge Stanley Golde at the 
beginning of the trial when he phoned five jurors at home from his jail cell. 
Two of the original jurors were dismissed after they said they could not be 
impartial because of the calls.

OVERRIDE OF SCHOOL SPENDING CUTS FAILS

Efforts to override Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of $462 million in school 
spending were dealt a fatal blow when Senate Democrats said they would not 
support such a confrontation and preferred to mend the problem through 
negotiations. Senate Democrats said they favor restoration of the cuts but are 
unwilling to reopen wounds from last month's bruising budget battle while 
Assembly Republicans are waiting on the other side of the Capitol to shoot down 
any Democratic override attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be a futile effort and it would just take time away from 
what we have to do with three weeks to go" before the Legislature adjourns for 
the year, said Senate leader David Roberti (D-Los Angeles). Any attempt to 
override a budget veto must start in the upper house because the spending plan 
signed last week by Deukmejian originated from a Senate bill.

A Placer County prosecutor said he may file criminal charges against Squaw 
Valley Ski Corp. because of a diesel fuel spill into a creek at Squaw Valley. 
The company is already facing possible fines of $1 million or more by the 
Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, which will consider the case 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Barbara, a deputy Placer County district attorney, said he wants to review 
a recent report on the spill before filing any criminal charges. The report, by 
the water board's staff, found that the corporation was negligent because it 
failed to investigate the spill when it was first discovered. An anonymous tip 
alerted authorities to last January's mishap, when 1,000 to 2,200 gallons of 
fuel poured into the creek. Bob Maddox, the ski resort's attorney, said the 
company spent $300,000 cleaning up the spill and installing a monitoring system 
to protect against future spills. He complained that the water board's report 
had "a predetermined outcome."

PROSECUTION RESTS IN AGUILAR RETRIAL

Prosecutors in the corruption retrial of federal Judge Robert P. Aguilar 
concluded their case with the testimony of Aguilar's colleague, Robert F. 
Peckham, former chief judge for the Northern California federal court district, 
and two FBI agents. Peckham and the agents who followed as defense witnesses 
testified that in the summer of 1987, the FBI agents saw Aguilar, 59, lunching 
with Abe Chapman, 84, a self-described mob hit man in the 1930s who also had 
several drug convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The agents said the FBI did not know that Chapman was a former relative of 
Aguilar's by marriage. Aguilar's lawyer, Paul Meltzer, was repeatedly stopped 
from asking questions about whether the FBI investigation and subsequent 
government prosecution of Aguilar were retaliation for the judge's liberal 
views. Meltzer contends that Aguilar, appointed by former President Jimmy 
Carter, is being persecuted for his decisions "favoring women, gays, Hispanics 
and working people."

COEXISTING WITH BEACH DENIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When frequenting local beaches, there's a philosophy that can help people 
peacefully coexist with jellyfish and stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem is that they're the residents, and the visitors are the ones 
who are encroaching," said Andy O'Leary, director of marine safety for Solana 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, to avoid stepping on a stingray, waders should shuffle their 
feet through the sand rather than running or striding in shallow water, said 
John Schooler, a Del Mar lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the commotion will cause a stingray to quickly swim away to a 
less-populated spot, Schooler said. 
</P>
<P>
"With jellyfish, there's not a lot you can do other than look for them," 
Schooler said. 
</P>
<P>
If a swimmer does get stung, there are simple remedies available at the nearest 
lifeguard tower. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing takes the sting out of a stingray sting like soaking the wound in hot 
water for 30 to 45 minutes, Schooler said. 
</P>
<P>
And, for jellyfish stings, it's best to treat the affected area with either 
rubbing alcohol or a mixture of equal parts of ammonia and cold water, said 
Chappy Mico, a Mission Beach lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the solution over the wound rather than rubbing it in; rubbing or 
scratching a jellyfish sting will cause the poison to spread, said Rodney 
Ferrif, an Oceanside lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
And, if alcohol and ammonia aren't available, vinegar and water can be used as 
a substitute, Schooler said. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither type of sting is usually very serious, some cases might 
require more extensive medical attention, Mico said. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are allergic to bee stings are allergic to stingrays as well," Mico 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As with other types of open wounds, stingray victims need to make sure the 
injury doesn't become infected, said Robert Snodgrass, associate aquarium 
curator at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. BLAKE FONTENAY

POLICE SAY ASSAULT WAS NOT HATE CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
RACISM: THE SHOOTING OF AN OCEAN BEACH MAN WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE A 
RACIALLY CAUSED CRIME, BUT NOW POLICE BELIEVE IT WAS JUST ASSAULT. 
</P>

<P>
The suspected Ocean Beach hate crime that prompted more than 200 to rally 
against what they said was a resurgence of racism in the beachfront community 
appears to be nothing more than an assault case, police say. 
</P>
<P>
The shotgun shooting of Philip Lewis, 26, early the morning of July 30, became 
a focal point for those in Ocean Beach who said racism there was on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized after Frank Gormlie, a community activist in Ocean 
Beach, posted hundreds of flyers around the area advertising the parking-lot 
gathering. Even though it took place just five days after the shooting, more 
than 200 attended. 
</P>
<P>
But now police investigators are saying there is more to the case than 
originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis told reporters he was chased by four white men in a pickup who yelled 
"hey nigger" at him after he left the residence of friends at the intersection 
of Brighton Avenue and Abbott Street after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis said in a statement to police that he mistook one of the four men in 
the pickup for a white friend who Lewis jokingly refers to as nigger, and he 
yelled that disparaging term at the men before they had communicated with him, 
said San Diego Police Sgt. Ed Casamassima, who coordinates patrols and 
investigations in the Western Division office. 
</P>
<P>
Statements from Lewis and the Meredith family, who Lewis said he had been 
visiting that night, also indicate that they did not know each other, 
Casamassima said. 
</P>
<P>
But Herb Meredith, 54, said Friday that his family and Lewis know each other 
"casually" through their 20-year-old son, Fran, who Meredith said has lifted 
weights with Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much just an assault case," said Casamassima. "There's no evidence 
as to what the motive is right now." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Meredith now says that Lewis was not at his house before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"He had not been at our house but at a place relatively close to where we were 
at," said Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
Meredith says that his family has been the target of continuous racism in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know that the people who have taken part in violent acts toward us have 
been racist to the core," he said, saying there have been "several incidents" 
during the previous few months directed at his family that were "racial in 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent acts, he said, are the two or three insults and taunts a week 
that come from vehicles that drive past his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Casamassima emphasized that the Lewis shooting was never officially classified 
as anything more than an assault. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no information that has been developed so far to show that it was a 
hate crime. More and more, it's leading away from that," said Casamassima. But 
he said investigators will continue to try to confirm whether the crime had a 
racial aspect.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT SHOOTS GUARD AT RESIDENTIAL HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient shot and wounded a security guard Thursday at a residential hotel 
on Skid Row, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The guard, Miguel Martinez, 19, was in the lobby when the gunman fired four 
shots from the doorway of the Weingart Center hotel about 10 a.m., authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, whom police said may have been a former resident of the 600-bed 
nonprofit hotel, fled and was being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was hit several times in the left shoulder and right thigh, Lt. Dee 
Moulin said. He was in stable condition at White Memorial Medical Center, a 
Weingart Center spokesman said. Martinez was employed by Pinkerton Inc. and had 
worked at the hotel at 515 E. 6th St. for 11 months, Elizabeth Bailey, the 
Weingart Center spokeswoman, said.

SPRING VALLEY RENEWS CAMPAIGN FOR CITYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIC AFFAIRS: PROPONENTS SAY MOVE WOULD GIVE AREA CONTROL OVER ROADS, PARKS 
AND DEVELOPMENT, BUT OPPONENTS THINK THE TAX BASE IS LACKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On and off for the last 10 years, community leaders of Spring Valley would 
gather and talk about making the town a full-fledged city, complete with its 
own city council and local control over new developments. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation was the buzzword, and self-determination was fast becoming 
popular in the 65,000-population community, according to Chris Heiserman, 
coordinator for the newly formed Spring Valley Incorporation Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group have renewed efforts in the last few months to increase 
community interest by campaigning for incorporation through fund-raisers and 
flyers. Incorporation advocates said they are pushing for cityhood before 
surrounding cities begin swallowing parts of the Spring Valley area by 
annexation. 
</P>
<P>
By incorporating, Heiserman said, Spring Valley could retain state revenue and 
property taxes generated by its residents, which are now distributed 
countywide, and have the autonomy to make land-use decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Local services, such as law enforcement, road maintenance, and parks and 
recreation would be transferred from the county to the city, at no extra tax 
cost to residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a community that needs its own focus and own identity," Heiserman said. 
"We are big and urban enough to handle the potential that has not yet been 
realized because the county can't solve our problems quick enough." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood advocates hope Spring Valley residents will give incorporation a 
thumbs up in a June, 1992 ballot. But, before they can take their cause to the 
polls, they must first clear some costly hurdles, according to Heiserman. 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots group has raised the first $4,000 of at least $30,000 it will 
need in its two-year incorporation effort. It is in the process of hiring an 
independent consulting firm, which will conduct a feasibility study to 
determine whether the area will have the tax base to support cityhood, 
Heiserman said. 
</P>
<P>
That report then goes to the San Diego County Local Agency Formation 
Commission, an independent agency that decides whether the city will be able to 
pay for a city manager, police protection and other municipal services. 
Incorporation must also be approved by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of incorporation opponents, however, already believe that, other than 
a few shopping centers around Spring Valley, the area lacks a big enough tax 
base to support incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have opposed plans for cityhood over the last 10 years, saying 
it will not improve services. 
</P>
<P>
"Other cities, like Lemon Grove, that incorporated are using our county 
sheriffs for their law enforcement," just as unincorporated areas do now, said 
long-time Spring Valley resident Eileen Smith, referring to Lemon Grove's 
contract with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Heiserman and other residents of Spring Valley also use Lemon Grove, its 
neighbor to the west, as a rallying point. They said the 13-year-old city now 
provides its residents with better services than when the community was under 
county tutelage. Cityhood has also spruced up a now dynamic Lemon Grove, 
according to Spring Valley resident Barbara Myers, whereas Spring Valley has 
been developed in a more "hodgepodge sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Gettman, an avid supporter of incorporation and chairman of the Spring 
Valley Planning Group, described his hometown as a gateway to East County and 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the county's untapped resources. People envision Spring Valley 
as just one small pocket of people. It's really a community with many different 
neighborhoods, some with million-dollar homes, surrounding Dictionary Hill in 
the middle," Gettman aid. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is just enough of a tax base in Spring Valley to support city 
services at or above current levels should it become a municipality. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't include any additional growth we may get," Gettman said. 
</P>
<P>
Heiserman said Spring Valley is fast becoming a "bedroom community," where 
weary commuters simply stop to sleep before racing back to a job in the city. 
He hopes the campaign to incorporate will halt what he calls the piecemeal 
overdevelopment of apartment complexes and multifamily units in the 
middle-class community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting more residential -- more of a bedroom community than a mixed-use 
community that can offer local jobs," Heiserman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted last year, more than half of the working 
population of Spring Valley commutes to jobs outside the community, Heiserman 
said. He contends that Spring Valley, by becoming a city, would be able to 
monitor the number of apartments built, as well as vigorously recruit new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had local control, we could address these issues," Heiserman said. "It's 
not that the county isn't paying attention, but they have higher problems to 
worry about than too many apartments in Spring Valley." 
</P>
<P>
If incorporated, Spring Valley would cover 17 square miles and be bounded on 
the south and west by Sweetwater Reservoir and the cities of San Diego and 
Lemon Grove. The northern boundary in the Casa de Oro neighborhood would extend 
to Tropico and Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
It would remain in the San Miguel Fire Protection District, Heiserman said, and 
the city would consider contracting with the Sheriff's Department for law 
enforcement protection during its first few years, rather than developing its 
own police department. 
</P>
<P>
The last time communities successfully incorporated was in 1986, when Solana 
Beach and Encinitas became municipalities, making them the 17th and 18th cities 
in San Diego County. After that, efforts in 1987 to incorporate Rancho Santa Fe 
and Fallbrook were defeated at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1980s, there was a trend for unincorporated areas to try to become 
cities. Poway and Santee did it in the early '80s. Lakeside also submitted a 
petition for incorporation but did not have the required number of signatures," 
said Mike Ott, staff analyst for LAFCO. 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency is now involved with Spring Valley and Ramona in their 
cityhood efforts.

JOE MORGAN'S SUIT PROTESTS 'PROFILE OF DRUG DEALER' THAT LED TO ARREST;

<P>
As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, 
police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for 
the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
When Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn 
abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police 
detective moved in quickly to question him. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men 
toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his suspect and pulled 
him to his feet. Placing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then 
marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration 
realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that March day in 
1988 was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted 
Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Morgan, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball 
broadcaster, is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court, 
claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain 
"profile" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was 
because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by," said 
William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug 
courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any 
drug activity," said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police 
officer who specializes in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of 
behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to 
transport narcotics. Such suspicious behavior includes erratic movements, 
paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without 
luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and 
question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers. But the court 
said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what 
the profile is I cannot tell you," said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. 
William Booth. "It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism. 
It's based on trying to protect the public." He said that, last year, 254 
narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. Through Aug. 
3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that 
his agency uses drug courier profiles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people 
involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is 
scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles. Morgan is 
seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case. But two months 
later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after 
ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally 
detained by police. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal," the 
judge concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA 
agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that this hadn't happened," Searle said. "I wish (Morgan) luck now that 
I know who he is. I just hope I never see him again." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan could not be reached for comment. But in court documents, he said that, 
on March 15, 1988, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a 
connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently 
making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was 
in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him 
retrieve it. When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- 
recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that 
Searle warned the man to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the 
floor. Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his back, wrenched his arms 
behind him and handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, 
but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. Searle 
then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's 
lawsuit. Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar 
incidents from occurring, his attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person 
who uses Los Angeles airport," said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also 
is black. "If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to 
any other black person." 
</P>
<P>
Searle, 42, denied the allegations, but told The Times he could not discuss 
specifics of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a 
good announcer," Searle said. "I wish it didn't happen. He just sort of went 
out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police 
Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to 
identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities 
and slapping the officer. 
</P>
<P>
"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted," Lewis said. "If he had 
cooperated, none of this would have happened. I think he had a bruised ego, and 
he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him." 
</P>
<P>
According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and 
Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had 
arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. They said he was using an 
alias. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they 
discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began 
looking for his companion. Since the passenger was black and indicated that his 
companion "looked like me," the officer began looking for a black man who was 
nervous-looking or having "other characteristics of a narcotics courier." 
</P>
<P>
When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan 
started screaming profanities and "making animal noises" and hit him in the 
chest with a wild swing. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered "acute physical 
and emotional distress and embarrassment" after the incident and expressed 
concern about damage to his reputation.

The U.S. Navy closed its investigation into allegations by a petty officer who 
said she was raped by a Soviet sailor during the recent visit by Soviet ships, 
saying Friday that the evidence was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence gathered by the Naval Investigative Services did not provide 
sufficient facts to allow for a conclusive resolution," said Lt. Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman, in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old, third-class petty officer told authorities she was raped while 
visiting the Soviet destroyer Admiral Vinogradov when it arrived in San Diego 
July 31. The woman said the assault had occurred at 6 p.m. on the first day of 
the Soviets' unprecedented visit to the West Coast. Earlier accounts that it 
reportedly occurred at 8 p.m. were incorrect, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she was wearing civilian clothes and had become separated from 
her friends while aboard the Soviet vessel. Since she did not report the 
incident until two days later, investigators were unable to find substantial 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the allegation very seriously," Pritchard said. "NIS did as thorough a 
job as they could possibly do, given the facts they had to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Though the evidence was inconclusive, officials were quick to point out that 
they were not discrediting the woman's account. 
</P>
<P>
NIS officials turned over much of their investigation to Soviet officials the 
day the warships departed, Aug. 4. More information was also relayed to them 
this week, Pritchard said. Soviet officials have said they will keep their U.S. 
counterparts informed of any developments in their investigation of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those unfortunate incidents that I wish we were able to come to a 
conclusion on," Pritchard said, "but we can't."

CITING ATTENDANCE AND HANDLE DROPS, ARLINGTON CUTS PURSES

Citing declines in average daily attendance and handle, officials of Arlington 
International Racecourse announced Thursday cuts in the value of five graded 
stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
They also announced the cancellation of the $25,000 Perrault Handicap on Oct. 
8, the final day of Arlington's 134-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Three $100,000 races -- the Equipoise Mile, the Arlington Matron and the 
Arlington Oaks -- were lowered to $75,000. The $150,000 Washington Park 
Handicap was cut to $100,000, while the $75,000 Swoon's Song Handicap was 
downgraded to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Arlington officials cut the value of several other stakes 
races by a total of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
A 5% across-the-board overnight purse cut was put into effect at that time, and 
track president Ken Dunn said Thursday that another purse cut was being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 74 days of the meeting, Arlington averaged 10,196 in on-track 
attendance and $2,501,232 in overall handle. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989's 95-day meeting, daily attendance averaged 12,616 and the average 
handle was $2,572,584. 
</P>
<P>
Many explanations have been offered for the decline. They include the opening 
of two dog tracks that are running concurrently in neighboring Wisconsin, major 
roadwork on highways near Arlington and the overall lackluster performance of 
the economy.

RAY CHARLES DELIVERS RICH HORN OF PLENTY; 
</P>
<P>
THE FAMED R&amp;B SINGER DELIVERED A RANGE OF MOODS AND STYLES TO THE COACH 
HOUSE THAT NEARED PERFECTION.

Ray Charles doesn't work long, and he certainly doesn't work cheap, but his 
work was something close to perfection Thursday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, who will turn 60 next month, was in startlingly good voice throughout 
his early show, the first of four sold-out performances in a two-night stand 
(that's about 1,500 tickets sold at $39.50 a shot, the bulk of which probably 
goes to Charles for the sort of payday that can really make a guy look like a 
genius). 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Charles' set clocked in at a precise and punctual 55 minutes, 
including a five-minute warm-up blow by his 16-man band. But if the overall 
framework of a Charles show is strictly bounded, the 11 songs he inserted 
within it Thursday were the essence of musical freedom and unchained 
spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
Charles' range of moods, styles and textures turned those 50 minutes into a 
cornucopia, with his voice giving full embodiment to the concept "horn of 
plenty." He rang true with cottony, deep-grained intonations to create a 
cloistered intimacy during ballads, or he blasted forth with piercing falsetto 
cries that served as exclamation points for more exuberant soul workouts. He 
consistently held and shaped sustained notes more firmly than you'd think 
possible for a graying icon. 
</P>
<P>
An unbalanced sound mix left things a bit unfocused at the start, and an 
abbreviated, if frisky, "Busted" was cause for some slight concern early on, 
especially when Charles swung immediately into "Georgia On My Mind." But the 
loving, unpredictable rendition he gave that chestnut erased any fear that this 
was going to be a short hour of casually tossed-off hits. For the rest of the 
show, Charles made every moment seem uncharted and full of invention -- whether 
on an achingly lovely ballad like "She Knows," a driving soul shot featuring 
the five Raelettes doing a strong impression of Aretha and the Sweet 
Inspirations, or a friendly, gospel-ized Charles takeover of a standard like 
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning." 
</P>
<P>
The show would have been a delight if Charles had played it with his hands tied 
behind his back. The fact that he frolicked just as freely with his fingers 
doubled the delight. No purist, Charles has discovered digital technology with 
a vengeance. He made liberal use of the electronic keyboard colorations at his 
disposal, changing timbres, bending notes, making his piano sound like a 
distorted blues guitar or a ringing vibraphone or even a synthesized bass -- 
and doing it all in a way that was light, playful and fully in sync with his 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Charles' band had a marvelous set too. It's hard to imagine a horn section -- 
13 members strong -- playing with a better blend of magnificent clout and 
sensitive control than Charles' crew. Typically, Charles uses his Orange County 
club dates at the Coach House or the Crazy Horse Steak House to get the kinks 
out of his ensemble before a major tour, and he isn't loath to chastise players 
for their imperfections right on the bandstand. This time, there was nothing 
for him to do but whoop with delight at the sound around him and holler yet 
another "Oh, yeah." The same went for a crowd that made a good investment, even 
at premium prices.

'BUSCANDO AMERICA' FINDS A PARODISTIC BRILLIANCE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: AN AZTEC GOD WHO AWAKENS IN LOS ANGELES GENERATES A MULTITUDE OF 
INTERESTING SITUATIONS. ITS LIMITATIONS ASIDE, THE PLAY SUCCEEDS IN SHOWING THE 
SHALLOWNESS OF MODERN VALUES.

<P>
What happens when an Aztec god who has lost his powers wakes up on a Los 
Angeles street and nobody recognizes him? For one thing, you get an allegorical 
sendup of Latino culture that unfolds at times with brilliant parodistic 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
The central premise of Roy Conboy's "Buscando America/Seeking America," which 
opened Thursday at Rancho Santiago College, couldn't be more pointed in its 
intention to satirize not only the shallowness of contemporary values but also 
the god's inflated vanity and injured pride. 
</P>
<P>
The play does this by exploiting the screwball misunderstandings engendered in 
the basic situation -- which is not unlike the landing of a dumbfounded Martian 
-- multiplying them from one scene to the next with a lowly taco vendor, a pair 
of star-struck Hollywood tourists, a macho drug dealer and his girlfriends, a 
rich woman unsatisfied by her wealth and an imperious magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest scene by far depicts the god Quetzalcoatl's confrontation with 
Carlos the drug dealer, a strutting vato who worships money, women and his 
immaculately polished, "chariot de oro" pickup truck -- not necessarily in that 
order. The humor is greatest here because it cuts closest to the bone (with no 
small thanks to Eddie Rivera's exaggerated performance as Carlos). 
</P>
<P>
But as enlightenment begins to dawn on Quetzalcoatl, whose quest to regain his 
former powers provides the play with its satirical thrust, it becomes all too 
apparent that "Buscando America" is trying for pathos as well as bitng social 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Conboy is much less successful at engaging our pity than our 
laughter -- mainly because the writing loses its tension and the tone becomes 
self-indulgent when it takes aim at the tragic dimensions of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mythic legend at the heart of the play -- Quetzalcoatl's conflict 
with his brother god Tezcatlipoca -- is established in absurdist terms as an 
Orwellian thriller replete with Big Brotherish video newscasts and 
pistol-toting assassins in trench coats and aviator sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is played against the vivid backdrop of a huge billboard depicting 
a black cityscape silhouetted by a bright, yellow sky and big, bouncy letters 
proclaiming: "Hello from Los Angeles." On either side of the billboard are two 
painted skeletons. The stage floor bears the death's-head emblem of an enormous 
white skull. The blend -- while inventive and visually rich -- just does not 
lends itself to pathos. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, in the meantime, shows the intense enthusiasm of amateurs imbued with 
belief, if not always with polish. As Quetzalcoatl, Michael San Roman brings 
great comic warmth to his performance. Laurie Woolery, who plays Tezcatlipoca 
in various guises -- including the taco vendor, a bus driver, and a corrupt 
major domo -- has a certain furious presence. 
</P>
<P>
Like Woolery, the other cast members also play multiple roles. Rivera stands 
out, though, with his pricelessly overdone strut as the drug dealer. Also 
notable is Jo Bond's gavel-pounding magistrate, a cartoonish figure who 
purposely can't pronounce Quetzalcoatl's name. 
</P>
<P>
As the playwright, Conboy could have used more help than he has received to 
date at the various workshops where the script has been developed. The script 
still needs to be trimmed of unnecessary repetitions as well as confusing 
inconsistencies. But he clearly has a work-in-progress worth refining. As the 
director, Conboy cannot be faulted. His staging is sharp and highly theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it ought to be said that this production of "Buscando America" 
represents something of a triumph as the maiden outing for the new 
multicultural troupe Cucucuevez, especially given its minimal financial 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
'BUSCANDO AMERICA/SEEKING AMERICA' 
</P>
<P>
A production of Cucucuevez at Rancho Santiago College's Phillips Hall Little 
Theatre West in Santa Ana, at 17th St. and Bristol. Written and directed by Roy 
Conboy. With Michael San Roman, Laurie Woolery, Stefane, Laura S. Salcido, 
Eddie Rivera, Michael Louie, Marcus Parrish, Jo Bond, Wendi de Barros and Ken 
Jensen. Scenic design by Scott Shaffer. Costumes by Gina Davidson. Lighting by 
Kris Clark. Music and sound by Marcus Parrish.

BOY BOUND FOR COLLEGE PACKS A LOT OF LIVING, LEARNING INTO 11 YEARS 
</P>

<P>
Most people haven't accomplished in 40 years what Jaime McEnnan has in his 11. 
</P>
<P>
The freckled Agoura Hills boy has been teaching the illiterate how to read 
since he was 8, acted on television's "General Hospital" and will soon enter 
college. A environmentalist and social activist, Jaime devours more than a book 
a day, understands Latin and was once chased by a lion in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
This fall he'll be the youngest student enrolled at Moorpark College and has 
the goal of taking every science course it offers. That's 112. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be really neat because I'm going to be a student and a teacher 
at the same time," he said, pointing out that he will still be teaching others 
how to read. 
</P>
<P>
His 15-year-old sister -- at camp in Minnesota this month boning up on her 
Russian -- entered Moorpark at 13. His father is a physicist and his mother was 
a Fulbright scholar who was involved in anthropological work in Romania in the 
1970s. She now spends much of her time running a children's theater group in 
Culver City and monitoring her own children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey McEnnan, 40, resists the idea that her son is some kind of wonder child. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody ought to be busy doing interesting things," she said. "I 
never thought of us as being extraordinary. Just busy." 
</P>
<P>
And busy he is. On Mondays, he's off to acting and fencing lessons. Tuesdays he 
learns math through the Japanese Kumon method. He takes painting lessons on 
Wednesdays, and on Thursdays and Fridays he rides horses and fences. Every 
other Sunday, he rehearses with his mother's Peace Child Repertory Theatre, 
which addresses problems such as racism, AIDS and inner-city violence. 
</P>
<P>
And he averages more than 40 books a month, mostly science fiction and history. 
"Half the time I'm in the car, so I read then," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, he said with a smile, he sleeps in and watches cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
In an oversized purple T-shirt and plastic yellow thongs, Jaime -- short for 
his age with a mop of brown hair -- arrived at his art class in Agoura Hills 
one morning this week carrying supplies under his arm. He speaks about each of 
his talents fluently but with a certain degree of humility. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't treat me like I'm a special kid," he said of his family and 
friends. "I have my best subjects and my worst. I don't go out saying I'm 
smarter than everybody. I'm just a normal kid, except (for) college." 
</P>
<P>
Jaime and his mother attribute his academic advancement to their refusal to be 
restricted by public and private school systems. 
</P>
<P>
At age 4, he began kindergarten and worked through grade three in one year. 
Skipping fourth grade, he completed the next four grades in two years before he 
and his mother decided to begin classes at home. He hopes to get his high 
school equivalency degree by next June. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime took the college entrance exams when he was 9. Although his mother 
doesn't want to share his scores, her son "did very well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some child prodigies whose parents have mapped out their entire careers, 
Jaime claims his goals are his own. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents didn't say, 'We want him to be a doctor; let's get him through 
college,' " he said. "It was my idea and my mom let me." 
</P>
<P>
His mother adds, "I think kids are like adults." And at Moorpark, she said, 
"they talk to him as if he's a human being instead of a child, which is 
refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
Muthena Naseri, an environmental science professor who taught Jaime during a 
trial college course in the spring, said the boy worked well with other 
students and demonstrated the ability to grasp the course work. 
</P>
<P>
He's a "likable young lad. Well-disciplined, well-adjusted. He doesn't stand 
out because he's so cool," Naseri said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime still expresses a childlike uncertainty about his goals. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 50 different things I want to do," he said. "I can't choose 
one of them." 
</P>
<P>
One that sounds good, though, is combining his art and science interests to 
become a marine biologist and zoologist who produces animal documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
His teachers and others say he will succeed no matter what he decides to do. He 
does not appear to be headed toward adolescent burnout because he is so 
multifaceted, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Day Otis, who manages his acting career, said that if he decides to 
continue performing, he will do well. He has already played the role of 
"Skeeter," the son of a wheelchair-bound mother on "General Hospital," and has 
done commercials for Apple Jacks and Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he is best for parts that call for gentleness, that call for insight, 
that call for deep feeling," Otis said. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest weakness? Said Otis: "Goodness, I've never been aware of one."

STATE PANEL OKS VENICE HIGH-RISE DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>

GOVERNMENT: THE COASTAL COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY APPROVES THE $400-MILLION 
CHANNEL GATEWAY PROJECT. CULVER CITY IS EXPECTED TO TRY TO BLOCK THE PLAN IN

In a decision that could have a big impact on development in one of the 
Westside's busiest traffic corridors, the California Coastal Commission Friday 
gave its blessing to a $400-million high-rise project in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Over the objections of neighboring Culver City officials, the state panel, 
meeting in the North Coast city of Eureka, voted unanimously to let stand the 
city of Los Angeles' approval of the Channel Gateway project on 16 acres of 
prime land. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Jerome Snyder, who acquired the land just outside Marina del Rey last 
year from a partnership headed by state Sen. Alan E. Robbins (D-Tarzana), said 
he hopes to start construction on the project within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very pleased," Snyder said. "It's an important step in a long, 
arduous process." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the commission, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, 
whose district includes Venice, urged the panel to favor Channel Gateway, 
saying that a delay could jeopardize $67 million in low-cost financing for 109 
affordable apartment units to be built there. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote did not include that of Commissioner Mark Nathanson, who 
served as the real estate broker for Robbins in the deal with Snyder. Nathanson 
did not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City officials, who are expected to go to court to try to block the 
project, had appealed to the state panel to reject Los Angeles' earlier 
approval of the project, citing environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
However, they are also angry with Los Angeles for suing to stop a $160-million 
shopping center in their city, and their involvement in the Channel Gateway 
matter is widely viewed as an act of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The feud is part of a larger contest to gobble up the remaining traffic 
capacity in the heavily congested Lincoln Boulevard corridor that has pitted 
Los Angeles, Culver City and Los Angeles County against one other, with each 
entity racing to get approval for projects that it backs. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City officials were chagrined after Los Angeles City Council members 
moved swiftly last month to approve the massive Channel Gateway project less 
than a day after a key council committee gave its blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Gateway would be built only three blocks from the proposed Marina Place 
shopping mall in Culver City. In addition, a virtual city within a city called 
Playa Vista is planned just south of Marina del Rey. Also, the county also 
wants to redevelop the marina. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the projects contemplated within the four-mile corridor that 
stretches from Santa Monica to Westchester, if approved, would include new 
office space equal to nearly half that of downtown Los Angeles, and enough 
retail space to house four malls the size of Westside Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Gateway, to be built in the Oxford Triangle area of Venice, won 
widespread support after Snyder acquired the land from Robbins, who retains a 
limited interest. 
</P>
<P>
Working with neighborhood activists and Galanter, Snyder altered Robbins' plan 
to build a 2.1-million-square-foot regional shopping center, office and 
residential project. Instead, Channel Gateway will include an office tower, at 
least 512 luxury condominiums in two 16-story buildings, and 544 apartments, 
including the units for very-low-income tenants. It will provide parking for 
3,460 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Although Caltrans officials have warned that Channel Gateway and the other 
projects planned for the corridor are certain to worsen already congested 
traffic, Channel Gateway's supporters insist that its merits outweigh such 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners were effusive in their praise of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"In my seven years on the commission, I can count on one hand the number of 
projects as sensitive from a social standpoint as this one," Commissioner David 
Malcolm of Chula Vista said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lily Cervantes of Salinas called it "a great project." 
</P>
<P>
"For once, we've got something here that will not just help the rich people and 
the actors and actresses living in Malibu, but that does something for 
working-class people to enable them to be able to afford living along the 
coast," she said.

GIRL, 7, RECANTS; D.A. CALLS OFF ABUSE PROBE OF FOSTER FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Three weeks after an administrative law judge ruled that a Whittier man had 
sexually molested his 7-year-old foster daughter, authorities have decided not 
to press criminal charges, saying the child has recanted her allegation. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is another twist in the long-running investigation of Steve and 
Becky Brown, who lost their foster care license July 17 after Administrative 
Law Judge Ralph B. Dash found that Steve Brown had had sexual intercourse with 
the girl and that his wife was aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns declined comment Friday, citing a gag order imposed by a judge in 
May. However, they have maintained their innocence throughout the criminal 
investigation and the revocation of their license. 
</P>
<P>
According to Whittier Police Detective William Heckel, the girl changed her 
statements Friday while he and Linda Chilstrom, a lawyer with the district 
attorney's office, interviewed her. Heckel said he is convinced that the child 
has been molested but it is uncertain by whom. She was reinterviewed to prepare 
the filing of a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of implicating Steve Brown as she had in the past, Heckel said, the 
child told them she had been molested in a Los Angeles motel while she was 
visiting her natural mother. Heckel said her statements point to a friend or 
friends of the mother, but the child provided first names only and there are no 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the administrative law judge's finding against the Browns, Heckel 
said: "I know what he found, but what can I do? How do I prove that with the 
statements that I have? We asked her about (her testimony during the 
administrative hearing) and she said she was scared to say anything else. Now 
whether she's telling the truth to us, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
However, the child's lawyer, Linda Pate, said the girl has been consistent in 
her statements for the last five months. She said it is not uncommon for child 
sexual abuse victims to recant their stories, particularly if they feel 
threatened or are in unfamiliar settings. 
</P>
<P>
Pate blamed the district attorney's office for interviewing the girl alone in 
an office instead of in a place where she felt comfortable. Pate said that she 
had suggested the South-Central Los Angeles Regional Center -- a private 
nonprofit agency where the girl initially implicated Steve Brown -- but that 
authorities refused to conduct the interview there. 
</P>
<P>
"This child is severely damaged," Pate said. "She's been totally consistent and 
if the (district attorney) wants to get a good statement from the child they 
ought to have the decency to interview a child in an environment where she 
feels secure." 
</P>
<P>
Pate said she will press forward with a civil lawsuit against the Browns. The 
suit seeks damages for the alleged sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Browns will regain their foster care license remains unclear. State 
officials who handled the case could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began in February, 1989, when the 7-year-old and her three 
sisters were removed from the Browns' home after medical examinations indicated 
that three of them had been sexually molested. Both the Browns and the natural 
family of the children were suspected, but no one was charged and the Browns 
continued to operate their foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Brown passed a polygraph test, and Whittier police concluded that the 
children had been molested in Los Angeles while with their relatives. But Los 
Angeles police concluded that the girls were molested at the foster home. 
</P>
<P>
A Juvenile Court judge later allowed the Browns unmonitored visits with the 
youngest girl -- a move that angered state officials, who complained that the 
child, who also showed signs of having been molested, should not have had 
contact with suspected abusers.

STAR-CROSSED;

<P>
QUARTET WAS ON ITS WAY TO THE TOP -- UNTIL THE WATTS RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Lewis hasn't forgotten how it used to be. The gold records. The packed 
nightclubs. The concerts with the Temptations and Gladys Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago he sang tenor for the Olympics, a popular quartet 
positioned at the edge of stardom. Already nationally known for a string of hit 
tunes on the pop charts, including the classic hits "Western Movies" and "Do 
the Hully Gully," the Los Angeles natives were at fame's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
The Watts Riots slammed the door in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a day, the group lost two members. One singer, Charles Fizer, was 
gunned down as he drove to a rehearsal. And a second singer, Melvin King, left 
the group after his sister was accidentally shot to death by police officers 
investigating a domestic dispute, Lewis recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting "happened right in front of (King)," said the 53-year-old tenor, 
resting his thin arms on a dinner table covered with yellowing posters and old 
newspaper clippings about the group. "That was it for him. We lost two members 
just like that. But we knew we couldn't quit. The group went on." 
</P>
<P>
But it was never the same. Despite another pair of hits the year after the 
riots, revamped versions of the quartet were unable to maintain its earlier 
success. The fanfare, the record deals, the airplay -- all evaporated soon 
after the upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a quarter-century after the riots, the Olympics are trying to recapture 
lost glory. The group -- which includes Lewis, William DeVase, Kenny Sinclair 
and original lead singer Walter Ward -- is shopping around new songs and 
reviving old dance steps. They are performing more -- the quartet recently 
played to a packed audience in Reno -- and looking for a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our time is coming," said Sinclair, 51, who has been with the group 19 years. 
"We still have what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
The quartet formed from the 1956 duo of Lewis and Ward, first cousins who 
whiled away their time at Inglewood's Centennial High School crooning for 
friends. After months of honing their talent in Centennial's bathrooms and 
hallways, the pair dubbed themselves the Challengers and took their act to the 
stages of local talent shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We would beat everybody," said Lewis. "Seriously. We were in talent shows 
something like 'Star Search.' We didn't lose one match. There just weren't any 
groups around who could touch us." 
</P>
<P>
One of the losing groups included Fizer and King. Defeated by the Challengers 
at a talent show near the Imperial Courts housing project, the two singers 
decided they would rather perform with Lewis and Ward than against them. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them in and then drew names from a hat a few days later, when we 
decided to change our name," said Lewis. "That's how we picked the name 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
It quickly became one of the hottest names on the rock circuit. The group's 
first hit, "Western Movies," went gold in 1958. "Do the Hully Gully," which 
started a national dance craze in 1960, and "Big Boy Pete," released the same 
year, both sold more than 500,000 copies, Lewis said. The quartet climbed into 
the Top 100 three times in 1960 alone. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few years, the Olympics shared stages with rock 'n' roll legends 
Little Anthony and the Imperials, the Coasters and Jackie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But then it all ended one tragic August evening -- 25 years ago this week. That 
night in 1965, as Fizer drove through Watts, his car was riddled with gunfire 
-- sprayed, Lewis claims, by National Guardsmen. 
</P>
<P>
"His car was shot 15 times," said Lewis, his voice lowering. "He wasn't 
rioting. He was coming to rehearsal. But they still shot him. Fifteen times." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County records show that Fizer, 22 at the time, died Aug. 14, 1965, 
shot in the head at 102nd and Long Beach streets. His death certificate 
indicates he died "during riots." 
</P>
<P>
However, Fizer's name is not among the 34 victims on the official list of those 
killed during the violence. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Guard said the names of all known victims of 
guardsmen's bullets were reported to government investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"If we shot him, we said we shot him," said Col. Roger Goodrich. "If (Fizer's 
shooting) hasn't come to light until now, I'm not going to investigate it. That 
would be inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, Fizer's death remains a puzzle to the surviving members of the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he wasn't rioting," said Lewis. "We weren't political. We didn't even 
know the riot was going on until the second day. We had been out of town, so 
Charles had no idea of what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the group received more bad news. King's sister was shot in the 
head after two police officers went to her home to check on a report of a 
domestic dispute, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't believe any of it," said Lewis. "The whole group was hurt. It 
was strange, though, because we had a show to do that night in San Diego. We 
went and did it, too. And Melvin went with us." 
</P>
<P>
But when the show ended, Lewis said, King quit. 
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, the group recruited several new members to replace 
King and Fizer. None seemed able to help the Olympics sustain their popularity. 
A host of contract problems with record companies and producers compounded the 
group's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has never heard all the songs we had," said Lewis. "And we didn't 
get paid a whole lot for the ones we did write. We got ripped off by lawyers 
and record companies." 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Sinclair joined the group. DeVase signed on nine years later to round 
out the roster. Ward and Lewis say the two have provided the group with a 
chemistry the Olympics have lacked since Fizer's death. 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed by the prospect that they might be considered out of step with the 
times, the performers say their new sound will be a refreshing addition to a 
popular music market currently dominated by the likes of soul idols like Bobby 
Brown and rap groups like Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do it now," Lewis said, "just like we did then."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LABOR FRAUD CASE RAISES CONCERN OVER 
CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Labor fraud charges filed this week against a Lancaster contractor in 
connection with a recent public works project have raised concerns among 
Lancaster officials about the contractor's labor practices on five other city 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
David McEwen said Friday he plans to look into the possibility of further 
investigation and other legal options in the wake of the criminal case filed 
Wednesday against the owners of Paxin Electric Inc. 
</P>
<P>
McEwen said it may be legally difficult to suspend or revoke more than $800,000 
in city contracts held by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
State labor officials have accused company President James Paxin, 38, and his 
wife Brenda, 40, of defrauding employees of about $170,000 on projects at 
Lancaster City Hall and a Santa Clarita park in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Paxins and their attorney have declined to comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 FILIPINOS PLEAD GUILTY IN ARMS-SMUGGLING 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COPTER, SENSING DEVICE USED TO HUNT FOR 
DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police used a helicopter with an infrared sensing device on Friday to search 
for a young physician who disappeared last week after setting out on a mountain 
bike ride. 
</P>
<P>
The search concentrated on the rugged Topanga Canyon area 20 miles northwest of 
downtown Los Angeles after officers found entries in Dr. Steven Ray Stoltz's 
journal that showed he had biked there twice before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big area. We're talking 50 square miles," said Los Angeles Police 
Detective John Sack. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz, 25, hasn't been seen or heard from since pedaling away last Friday on 
his blue-green mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends searched on foot Thursday and volunteer cyclists were to 
join the search on Saturday, scouring the canyon's many miles of bike trails, 
said Beverly Hartunian, the mother of another young physician. She is acting as 
a volunteer liaison with police in the search effort.

</P>
<P>
STREET VIOLENCE: THE VICTIM OF AN AMBUSH SHOOTING IN VAN NUYS WAS WEARING 
GANG-STYLE ATTIRE BUT WAS NOT A GANG MEMBER, POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "hard-working young man" died in a barrage of gunfire outside his Van Nuys 
apartment, apparently killed by a gunman who mistook him for a gang member 
because of his clothes, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Delatorre Munoz, 20, a busboy at a Mission Hills restaurant, was shot 
about midnight Thursday in the 14200 block of Vanowen Street as he walked home 
from a store where he had gone to get a snack after work. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was wearing dark pants, a sleeveless T-shirt and a black Los Angeles 
Kings hat -- an outfit favored by gang members -- when five men jumped from 
behind bushes in front of his apartment building and opened fire with at least 
one gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really torn up by this," said Robert Amaya, manager of the restaurant 
where Delatorre worked. "He was a model employee. There is no one here who has 
a bad word to say about Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made. Police said the slaying may have been related to a 
drive-by shooting that took place four hours earlier one block away. In that 
incident, two men, 19 and 22, were slightly wounded when shots were fired and a 
gang name was shouted from a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
But Delatorre was not a gang member and had no part in the earlier shooting, 
police said. He was cleaning tables at Millie's Country Kitchen when the first 
shooting occurred, Amaya said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of what he was wearing, he may have been mistaken for a gang member," 
Detective James Vojtecky said. "That's what we are speculating, because there 
appears to be no motive. He was not known to us as a gang member. Everyone we 
talk to says he was a hard-working young man." 
</P>
<P>
Delatorre shared an apartment with his older brother and a cousin in the small 
apartment building. He worked as a busboy five nights a week and was considered 
an excellent employee, Amaya said. Friends said he was saving money for a 
long-awaited trip to Mexico to visit his mother and other relatives, whom he 
had not seen in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Amaya and others who knew Delatorre said the young man often presented a tough 
image but actually was soft-spoken and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a tough guy," Amaya said. "Once you talked to him you wouldn't think 
that. At the end of the night shift, he would walk the female managers to their 
cars. If one said she was going to the gas station he would go with her and 
pump the gas. That was the type of kid he was." 
</P>
<P>
Amaya said Delatorre, who worked at the restaurant for three years, was working 
on Thursday until 10 p.m. Two hours later he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Delatorre was hit by bullets at the front gate of his 
apartment complex, but managed to run through the courtyard to the door of his 
apartment, collapsing before he could open it.

"He was a good kid," Delatorre's apartment manager said Friday, contemplating a 
bullet-punctured window. "He was friendly and I never had any problems with 
him. These gangs . . . nobody is safe." 
</P>
<P>
One of Delatorre's friends went to his apartment after hearing of the shooting, 
but the victim's brother and cousin were gone. The young man, who like the 
apartment manager declined to give his name, was confused by the tragic news. 
</P>
<P>
"I came when I heard," he said. "I don't believe this. Why shoot Pedro?"

FOREMAN IS BURIED ALIVE IN CAVE-IN 
</P>

A 33-year-old drilling company foreman died Friday when he was buried head 
first after a trench caved in at a hotel construction site in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened moments after the foreman had warned another worker not 
to stand near the edge of the trench because of the potential for a cave-in, a 
drilling company official said. 
</P>
<P>
Only Enrique Ayala's feet were visible when firefighters arrived about 8 a.m. 
to attempt to rescue him, authorities said. Two of the victim's brothers, who 
also work for Malcolm Drilling Co., watched as firefighters spent an hour 
working with shovels, buckets and their hands to free him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impatient," said Manuel Ayala of Sylmar, who rushed to Glendale after 
hearing of the accident. "I was hoping they'd have more people helping. I 
wanted to help, but they wouldn't let me go near it." 
</P>
<P>
When Enrique Ayala was freed, paramedics administered cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and rushed him to Glendale Adventist Medical Center. But hospital 
spokeswoman Sandra Wachter-Van said he was dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Ayala, of Pacoima, was worried about another worker's 
safety at the time of the accident at 100 W. Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
"Ayala was explaining to a laborer not to stand near the edge of the hole 
because of a possibility of a cave-in," said Shah Arfania, controller of 
Malcolm Drilling. "He was directing the laborer away from that area. The next 
thing that happened is that the hole caved in and Enrique fell in head-first, 
with the rubble and dirt on top." 
</P>
<P>
Arfania said the crew had just used an auger to dig 15 feet down, creating a 
trench that would be filled with concrete to anchor the $36-million, 18-story 
Red Lion hotel. The cave-in occurred before a pipe could be lowered to secure 
the sides of the trench. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's younger brother, Phillip Ayala, 24, who is employed at the 
Glendale site, said he and other workers immediately tried to free the foreman 
but were unsuccessful. "It was really packed tight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Capt. Steve Wood said firefighters decided not to use a crane or 
power tools because they feared they would further injure Ayala or destroy any 
air pocket that might be sustaining him. Wood said he understood the impatience 
of onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very frustrating type of rescue because it has to be slow and 
meticulous and very deliberate so as not to do any further harm to the 
individual in the hole," Wood said. "You also had to be concerned about any 
second collapse." 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the job site was shut down for the day. The California 
Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA spokesman Rick Rice said his agency has received no previous 
complaints about the Glendale job site. Records of any recent violations by 
Malcolm Drilling were not available Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm spokesman Arfania said Friday's incident was his company's first 
cave-in death since the firm was founded in 1962. He said Ayala had worked for 
the firm since 1987.

MOTHER KILLED; BOY, 2, LEFT IN CAR WITH CASH 
</P>

<P>
At first they seemed separate incidents, half a day and more than 60 miles 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, residents of a Downey neighborhood alerted police that a little 
boy had been found abandoned inside a blue Toyota Cressida parked on their 
street. When Downey police took the 2-year-old into protective custody, they 
quickly realized this was not a typical child-abandonment case. Concealed 
inside the car's trunk was $149,780 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight the previous evening, Riverside County sheriff's 
deputies in Hemet had been called to a deserted area near Gilman Hot Springs. 
There they found a 47-year-old Latina, severely beaten. She had crawled to a 
roadway seeking help. Not far away, another Latina, 24, lay dead of a gunshot 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
It took several hours before officials realized the tragic connection between 
the abandoned 2-year-old and the slaying scene. The toddler, identified as Jose 
David, was the son of the dead woman, Claudia Ochoa of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy's mother and a family friend were kidnaped Wednesday night," Downey 
Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes said Friday. He said Ochoa's 1984 Toyota was left 
behind in Downey with the child inside when two abductors, identified as Latino 
men, took the women away in a dirty light blue van with no windows. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Riverside Sheriff's office, the women were taken to a location 
near Hemet, where Ochoa was killed. The 47-year-old survivor of the incident, 
whose name has not been made public, was "beaten in the head with a blunt 
instrument," according to police. She underwent surgery at an unidentified 
hospital, and her condition was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is continuing as to the identity of the suspects, the motive 
for the apparent execution-style murder, and the reason the vehicle and toddler 
were abandoned in Downey," Mayes said. 
</P>
<P>
However, because of the amount of cash discovered in the Toyota's trunk, Mayes 
said detectives believe the incident was drug-related.

AILING SON HELD IN DEATH OF HIS VISITING MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys woman was bludgeoned to death in Manhattan with a hammer and a 
wooden statue by her AIDS-afflicted son, who then attempted suicide by setting 
himself on fire, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Leona Imbert, 63, had flown to New York to care for her 39-year-old son, Earl 
Imbert, an unemployed actor who worked as a word processor, said Sgt. Al King 
of the New York Police Department. She had told her Van Nuys neighbors she was 
planning to bring her son back to California because he had suffered a stroke 
and needed constant care, said Juanita Skaggs, who manages the building in the 
15300 block of Gault Street where Leona Imbert had lived alone for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Police went to Earl Imbert's apartment on E. 21st St. in Manhattan on Thursday 
after receiving a call from his brother in California, King said. The brother, 
whom police identified as Albert Imbert, had become alarmed about his mother's 
safety after talking with Earl, King said. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived, Earl Imbert answered the door wearing a charred, 
blood-spattered polo shirt and shorts, King said, and had open sores on his 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the body of his mother wrapped in a blanket. The woman had been 
beaten "almost beyond recognition" with a hammer and a small wooden carving, 
which police confiscated, King said. Police believe Leona Imbert was killed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also found two one-way tickets to Los Angeles in the man's apartment. 
Earl Imbert told detectives he had killed his mother and then wrapped himself 
in a shower curtain and set himself on fire, King said. But he jumped into the 
shower after suffering second- and third-degree burns over 25% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us all about it -- gave himself up," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Imbert was arrested Thursday and booked on suspicion of second-degree murder 
and criminal possession of a weapon -- the hammer and the statue. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Imbert, who could not be reached for comment, told officers his brother 
had AIDS and a history of psychological problems, said King, who described Earl 
Imbert as "a disturbed man." 
</P>
<P>
"He spoke to us in a flat monotone the whole time," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Imbert was taken to the burn unit at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, 
where he was in critical but stable condition late Friday, said Kathy Robinson, 
a spokeswoman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
King said police do not know the motive for the slaying. Neighbors in Imbert's 
building, where he has lived for several years, told officers they did not hear 
any unusual noises coming from the apartment. However, they said they believed 
the man had told his mother he had a brain tumor and concealed the fact that he 
had AIDS, King said. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying prompted AIDS organizations in Los Angeles to point out that 
although people with the disease are more likely than the general population to 
commit suicide, they are not ordinarily any more violent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very unusual -- there are people with AIDS who have dementia, but they 
are usually too physically disabled to commit violent crimes," said Sally Jue, 
mental health program manager for AIDS Project Los Angeles.

GARRISON HOPING TO SLOW GRAF MORE IN SEMIFINAL TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
All that's missing are the stopwatches. People not only watch Steffi Graf play 
tennis, they time her. 
</P>
<P>
Fans have become so accustomed to the world's No. 1 player eliminating 
opponents quickly that it is no longer a game of inches. Instead, it is one of 
minutes and seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's 6-3, 6-2 victory over France's Nathalie Tauziat Friday afternoon in a 
quarterfinal match of the Great American Bank tennis tournament took just 54 
minutes but seemed, by standards Graf has unintentionally set, to last a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
In Graf's first two matches here, she defeated Stephanie Rehe in 54 minutes and 
Kathy Rinaldi in 76. While no official records are kept, her 33-minute victory 
over Kim Kessaris in Mahwah, N.J., in 1988, is thought to be a record. 
</P>
<P>
But all week, players have been saying that Graf, whose three-year anniversary 
as the world's No. 1 player is Aug. 16, isn't as dominant as she once was. They 
say she's vulnerable, that since she has been beaten this year -- twice in 
straight sets by Monica Seles -- other players are catching on. 
</P>
<P>
Another who has discovered this is third-seeded Zina Garrison, No. 5 in the 
world. Garrison, 26, beat Graf, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, this year in the semifinals at 
Wimbledon. She played picture-perfect tennis against New York's Terry Phelps in 
the evening match, winning, 6-0, 6-3, in front of 3,814 and setting up a 
semifinal showdown against Graf today on center court at 12:30. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Martina Navratilova injured her calf and withdrew from the 
tournament earlier in the week, leaving the remaining top seeded players to 
meet before the final. Fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, who now lives 
in Switzerland, will meet Barbara Paulus in the other semifinal tonight at 
6:30. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Graf holds a 5-2 edge over Houston's Garrison in head-to-head 
competition, but Garrison won their last meeting at Wimbledon. Last year in the 
final of this tournament, Garrison threatened Graf before losing, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Both players downplayed the importance of today's rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be anything special because I lost the last time," Graf 
said. "I'm going to try hard. It's not going to be easy, because she has the 
type of game that doesn't let me get into a rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Said Garrison, when asked if Graf would be looking to avenge her loss in 
England: "I don't know about revenge. It was really tough when I played her 
last year. She knows I'm out there, she knows what I'm about, she know I'm 
going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Against Tauziat, Graf said she settled down more in the second set and played 
better than in the first, when she let Tauziat break her serve and then hold to 
close the score to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall it was a good match," Graf said, "especially in the second set. I 
think I was playing sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Graf used a new racket and tried out a new top-spin backhand she has been 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the racket) was very tight," she said. "I tried not to go for every shot, 
to be a little more patient. I told myself to be a little more cautious, a 
little more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Graf hit one topspin backhand, and it sailed far over the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"So I didn't try it for a while," she said. "I tried it again, but it's not yet 
the backhand I want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Tauziat agreed. She said it would take more than a new backhand for Graf to 
regain her stronghold on women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"That will not do it," Tauziat said. "It takes two or more years to perfect a 
shot like that." 
</P>
<P>
Tauziat said her level of play wasn't so far behind Graf's, that she just made 
too many mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between her and me is not so much talent," she said. "It's 
close. The difference, it's more in my mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison didn't make many against Phelps. She stormed through the first set and 
never trailed in the second. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Phelps broke Garrison to close to 2-1 in the second set, the 
nighttime crowd of 3,418 almost gave her a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous," Phelps said. "I don't know why I was pushing everything. It 
was terrible. I was not very good. I feel sorry for the people watching." 
</P>
<P>
Phelps is ranked 97th in the world. Her highest was in 1986, when she was No. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't play that well," Garrison said, "but I played real well. I didn't 
miss much in the first sets, although I did make some mistakes in the second." 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said she is picking Graf to win tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steffi (will win)," she said. "She may want some revenge, and I didn't 
really prepare Zina very well. I didn't give her much of a workout." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two-time U.S. Open winner Tracy Austin, who has been an on-again, off-again 
tour player since 1983 because of neck and back injuries, arrived in San Diego 
Friday to do commentary for Prime Ticket today and Sunday. . . . No News is 
Good News: Said one woman to a group of other women watching Friday's matches: 
"I tape my matches and watch them at night instead of the news. The news these 
days is so depressing."

GREAT MANAGERS STANDING IN LINE FOR HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Steadman, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Applauding Earl Weaver's acceptance into the Baseball Hall of Fame is a 
reasonable presumption but far from automatic. The record book builds strong 
cases for other imposing nominees, namely Leo Durocher, Billy Southworth, Frank 
Selee and Ned Hanlon, who is credited with devising modern managerial strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Closing in fast, statistically, are Sparky Anderson and Tommy Lasorda, both of 
whom are still active. And not to be discounted are Dick Williams and Whitey 
Herzog, currently retired. 
</P>
<P>
The question that is pertinent in the land of the Baltimore Oriole is when will 
Weaver follow Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson and Jim Palmer -- three players 
he had the good fortune to have on his teams -- into the Hall of Fame? Weaver, 
quite naturally, would thrill to the honor as would his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I'd regard as the absolute highlight," he says, but realizes 
that the competition offers impressive credentials, meaning longevity, pennants 
won and winning percentage. Weaver was with the Orioles 17 years, led them to 
four pennants and his .583 percentage is ninth best of all-time. 
</P>
<P>
In the percentage category, Jim Mutrie, who managed before the turn of the 
century, Selee and Southworth are ahead of him. They have marks of .611, .598 
and .597. Mutrie won three pennants, Selee five and Southworth four -- the same 
number as Weaver. Growing up in St. Louis, Weaver studied -- even idolized -- 
Southworth as he led the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
A strong contender, too, is Durocher, who managed 24 years, had a percentage of 
.540 and won three pennants. It is difficult to assess a manager's worth to a 
team because more depends on the talent he has available, as witness what 
happened to Casey Stengel, who in his nine years with the Boston Braves and 
Brooklyn Dodgers never reached the first division. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when Stengel got the opportunity to lead the New York Yankees, he won 10 
pennants in 12 years. Then he closed out his career by putting in four seasons 
with the other New York team, the Mets, and finished 10th and last. A disaster. 
So evaluating a manager's worth is nebulous at best. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that Weaver will face his sternest challenge from Selee, 
Southworth, Durocher and when they retire, Anderson and Lasorda, each of whom 
has won five and four pennants, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame has selected a modest number of managers, considering that 
only 14 have been picked since the selections began in 1939. The lineup 
includes Walter Alston (the last manager named to the Hall, 1983), Charles 
Comiskey, Clark Griffith, "Bucky" Harris, Miller Huggins, Al Lopez, Connie 
Mack, Joe McCarthy, John McGraw, Bill McKechnie, Wilbert Robinson, Stengel, 
George Wright and Harry Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Before Weaver can be considered by the jury weighing his accomplishments, he 
must wait a minimum of five years, which means that he becomes eligible in 
1992. The voting is the responsibility of the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee 
of 18, including ex-players, executives and five sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
So the Baseball Writers Association, which elects the modern players, will not 
have any influence when it comes to addressing the subject of managers. An 
impressive portfolio can be advanced in behalf of Hanlon, leader of the old 
Orioles. He won five pennants, three in Baltimore and two in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
Plus the fact that he is generally credited with conceiving the strategical 
"book" used by managers everywhere. Does color and charisma and having a 
commanding presence enter into it? That seems doubtful, considering the 
personalities and styles of Durocher and Alston. 
</P>
<P>
Durocher was demonstrative; Alston passive. Yet one is in and the other waits 
in line. How managers make the Hall of Fame can't be correlated to numbers or 
reputations. A backlog of exceptional candidates awaits the call.

CHARGERS NOW FIND OUT: SHOULD HE STAY, OR SHOULD HE GO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers open their four-game exhibition season tonight against the Dallas 
Cowboys with a simple mandate: Find out who can play and who can't. 
</P>
<P>
If the philosophy sounds basic, it is. But it isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Talent evaluation is a tricky part of NFL life, and with 80 players still in 
camp, this is the time of year it can be most complicated. 
</P>
<P>
And it could be particularly so for the Chargers, a team with more new faces 
than most. In addition to the usual collection of free agents, many of whom 
were originally brought in as little more than warm bodies to fill out training 
camp practices, there are quite a few more expensive newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Primary among these are the team's nine veteran Plan B free agents, plus 16 
draft choices out of a class of 17, largest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
These are the players to which the Chargers will be paying careful attention in 
the exhibition against the Cowboys beginning at 7 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We've determined that of the new players, there are some people we really feel 
have a chance to make this team and be productive for us," Coach Dan Henning 
said. "We're not going to evaluate the guys in this game on what they think 
they can do, or what we think they can do. We're going to evaluate them on what 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
"You pick them for potential, but you play them by performance. That is the 
only way you can tell." 
</P>
<P>
The best way is in a game. And after three weeks of practice, including 
controlled scrimmages against the Rams and Phoenix Cardinals, that is what the 
Chargers will do tonight against a team that is coming off a 1-15 season, the 
Cowboys' worst since they were 0-11-1 in their debut year of 1960. 
</P>
<P>
That led to a talent turnover that rivaled any in the league. The Cowboys were 
the most active NFL team in the Plan B market, signing 15 players. They also 
tried to boost their offense in the draft, taking running back Emmitt Smith of 
Florida in the first round and wide receiver Alexander Wright of Auburn in the 
second. The only problem now is that both are unsigned and will not play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys do have quarterback Troy Aikman, back for his second high-paid 
season and saying he is more comfortable than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, everyone was more curious about what was going to happen," Aikman 
said. "This year, I can just go out and be myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are looking for much the same from Billy Joe Tolliver, their 
second-year quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver had a rough time last week in the scrimmage against the Cardinals, 
throwing two interceptions. This game will continue his NFL education. While 
Henning is using the game to evaluate several new players, he also is laying 
groundwork for the season opener against the Cowboys in Dallas Sept. 9. Maybe 
nowhere is this more important than at quarterback, where the Chargers consider 
themselves talented, but where they clearly are inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver will be making only his seventh NFL start of any kind. But even that 
little bit of game action almost qualifies him as seasoned veteran compared to 
his backups. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver will be followed by Mark Vlasic, who played in only three games in his 
first three seasons and missed last year because of knee surgery, and John 
Friesz, a sixth-round draft choice from Idaho making his debut in live NFL 
contact situation. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Tolliver will take about half the snaps, with Vlasic and Friesz 
splitting the other half. That does not necessarily mean Tolliver will not play 
in the second half, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
"What if we get only five snaps in the second quarter?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Tolliver then would also play after halftime. Henning has left that 
option open. There are a number of other things he wants to see tonight as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
It's that time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The game will shown in San Diego on a taped basis on Ch. 10 at 3 p.m. Sunday. 
The radio broadcast will be live on XTRA-AM (690). . . . Tight end Andy Parker 
has two loose teeth and 12 stitches in his lip as the result of an altercation 
in Thursday's practice with linebacker Cedric Figaro on a punt coverage drill 
and will not play, Coach Dan Henning said. Henning said he expected also to 
hold out tight end Arthur Cox (back) and that running back Ronnie Harmon 
(dislocated finger), H-back Joe Caravello (coming back from knee surgery), 
defensive end Burt Grossman (shoulder) and nose tackle Joe Phillips (knee) 
likely will play sparingly. Sure to be missing are linebackers Leslie O'Neal 
and Junior Seau, the team's two remaining contract holdouts. . . . Fuad Reveiz 
and John Carney will alternate kicking duties, and John Kidd and Keith English 
will trade off the punting, Henning said. . . . Henning on wide receiver Nate 
Lewis, a seventh-round draft choice from Oregon Tech: "Nate practiced better 
against Phoenix than he played in the scrimmage (last week). That has got to be 
reversed. Not to the point where I want him to practice poorly, but the object 
is to play well in the game." . . . The Cowboys will stay on in San Diego for 
joint practices with Chargers Monday and Tuesday at UC San Diego.

SANTIAGO HAS HAPPY RETURN AS PADRES WIN 
</P>

<P>
Benito Santiago looked cautiously as he entered the visiting clubhouse Friday 
afternoon at the Astrodome. The players were wearing Padre uniforms, so he knew 
they were his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
But he had a strange and curious feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I felt like a rookie again," he said. "You know, a lot has 
happened since I left. It wasn't that I was nervous, or afraid, I was just 
excited to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, 'Oh, wow. I've got to sit down and relax.' " 
</P>
<P>
It took all of about, oh, four or five innings for Santiago to feel as if he 
was back where he belonged, sitting behind the plate once again and helping the 
Padres to a 2-0 victory over the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
There he was, showing off prehaps the finest arm in the game, whipping throws 
to second and first and daring anyone to run on him. There he was, hitting 
three line drives to the outfield, one being caught against the wall and 
another resulting in a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
And there he was, being mobbed by reporters who wondered just what it was like 
returning to the game he loves. 
</P>
<P>
"You know something," Santiago said, "if I had stayed home for another week, I 
certainly would have been in a sanitarium, because I would have gone crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago laughed, but really, the apprehension he had been feeling was almost 
unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 56 days since he last played for the Padres. When he last swung a 
bat for them, he was the best-hitting catcher in the game, on his way to his 
second consecutive All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before he suffered a fractured left forearm, before six inactive 
weeks with a cast on his broken left arm. And that was before he spent a week 
in rehabilitation just trying to regain his timing. 
</P>
<P>
Now he was in front of 16,576 fans at the Astrodome, exhibiting his skills 
after the longest layoff of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us knew what would happen," said Ed Whitson (9-7), who 
allowed just seven hits in 8 1/3 innings. "It's been a long time. But to see 
what he did tonight, to comeoff the DL (disabled list) and hit three rockets, 
that's just unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not supposed to be doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Really, his only flaw the entire night was his pitch selection. 
</P>
<P>
But who could blame him? He had not seen the Astros play since June 6. He had 
to introduce himself to four of his own teammates and met two coaches that came 
aboard since he broke his arm June 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll take some time for him to get his catching head on," Whitson said. "We 
struggled tonight for the first four, five innings, and then he caught on. 
</P>
<P>
"He just forgot what some of the hitters liked to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, too, was a different pitcher than Santiago last remembered. In these 
past two months, catcher Mark Parent has forced Whitson to throw his palmball 
more often, even changing speeds with the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Just how effective was it Friday? 
</P>
<P>
Whitson allowed only one baserunner to reach third during the first 8 1/3 
innings, giving way only after Craig Biggio Glenn Wilson got back-to-back 
singles. Craig Lefferts came on in relief and, two batters later, recorded his 
17th save. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson was so overpowering, in fact, that the Astros hardly believed it 
themselves, suggesting that Whitson was using an illegal substance. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, he's got a nasty changeup," said Astro starter Jim Deshaies (5-10). "I 
saw one in the late innings, and it looked like it got on an elevator." 
</P>
<P>
Said Astro Manager Art Howe: "He's got movement on it, that's for sure. 
Obviously, it's not easy to pick up. It makes you look pretty bad at times. 
Whatever . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But on a night like this, the Padres hardly wanted to get themselves embroiled 
in controversy, particularly when they felt fortunate enough just to escape 
with a victory after going the final eight innings without obtaining a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big emotional lift just having Benny back," said shortstop Garry 
Templeton, who saved a run in the ninth with a diving stab. "You know it was 
funny, when Whit (Whitson) first started pitching, I thought it was (Tom) 
Lampkin behind the plate. But then he stood up and threw the ball, and I said, 
'Oh, that's right, that's Benny back there.' 
</P>
<P>
"Man, it's sure good to have him back." 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to know for sure if the Padres (52-59) would be contending in 
the National League West instead of sitting in fourth, 12 1/2 games back, if 
Santiago had not been injured. But certainly, there are facts that support the 
Padres' claim that the situation would be entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were 30-28 and seven games out of first place when Santiago 
departed; they went 21-31 in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was batting .317 with nine homers and 33 RBIs at the time of the 
injury; his replacements batted .205 with three homers and 13 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"You think about it," Templeton said, "and with Benny batting down in the 
order, we had a pretty strong lineup. But without him, we kept trying to fill 
that sixth spot, and we never really could. Watch what happens to the bottom of 
the order now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you, that's a big lift when you have a guy like that down there." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago listened to all of the compliments and praise. He knows all of the the 
statistical differences. But still, he doesn't want to sound egotistical. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say I'm better than anyone here," Santiago said. "Everybody's 
been playing so well together. I just want to help out." 
</P>
<P>
But as Padre Manager Greg Riddoch said, "Believe me, he will, oh, will he 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have quietly decided that Calvin Schiraldi will be in the starting 
rotation for the remainder of the season, demoting Eric Show to bullpen duties. 
Schiraldi, who's scheduled to start tonight against the Astros, has been much 
more effective as a starter than a reliever since joining the Padres Aug. 31, 
1989. He owns a 4-1 record as a starter with the Padres, allowing 24 hits in 32 
1/3 innings with a 3.34 ERA. But he is 2-4 with a 3.76 ERA as a reliever, 
allowing his past 16 inherited runners to score. "I couldn't be happier," 
Schiraldi said, "because I always wanted to start." . . . Padre first baseman 
Jack Clark still does not know if his hamstring is just strained or pulled. He 
is expected to miss the entire three-game series in Houston, but Manager Greg 
Riddoch is optimistic about a quick return. "They don't really think it's torn, 
but he's still got a bite there." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Eddie Williams cleared waivers Friday night and is expected to 
report to triple-A Las Vegas by today. Any team in the major leagues could have 
claimed Williams for a $25,000 purchase price, but all declined. "He needs to 
work on his defense," Riddoch said. "He got caught up in a numbers game here, 
and we just don't have a need for him right now." . . . What has happened to 
the Padres' running game? They have stolen just nine bases in the past 27 games 
while being caught 11 times. And in the past nine games, they've stolen two 
bases and have been caught four times. "I think pitchers are smarter now," 
Riddoch said. "Everybody's adjusted their release to the plate. They're using 
the slide-step and the five-second hold now." 
</P>
<P>
Padre left fielder Joe Carter paid the price for his two long, running catches. 
He suffered a split lip when he chased Glenn Wilson's foul ball to the stands, 
tripping over the bullpen mound as he caught the ball and fell. So what happens 
when he steps to the plate in his next at-bat? He gets hit in the leg by Jim 
Deshaies, the seventh time he has been hit by a pitch this season. . . . Padre 
starter Bruce Hurst ended the longest drought in the major leagues when 
obtained his run-scoring single Thursday night against the Atlanta Braves. He 
had gone 112 at-bats in the big leagues without an RBI when he obtained his 
career first off Charlie Leibrandt. When told of the historic hit, Hurst said, 
"Well, hopefully I won't have to wait another 112 at-bats before my next one." 
. . . Padre outfielder Shawn Abner announced Friday that he no longer wants to 
be called a reserve outfielder or even an extra player. "I'd prefer to be 
called a supplemental starter," Abner said. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Darrin Jackson made his first start for the Padres since June 3. 
. . . The Astros have won only four games all season in which both teams have 
scored more than four runs. . . . You want to know the primary reason why the 
Astros are 35-22 at home and 18-36 on the road? Their pitching staff is 
allowing 3.4 runs a game at home, 5.3 on the road. . . . Mark Grant, traded by 
the Padres a month ago to the Braves, will make his first start since 1988 
today. "I'm really, really excited," Grant said. "This is a great opportunity 
for me to start over again." . . . The Padres pulled off their annual gag to 
their newcomers by stealing their street shoes and replacing them with the most 
hideous shoes money could buy. "I can't believe these things," said Fred Lynn, 
laughing.

Resorts International Inc.: The Atlantic City, N.J.-based hotel and casino 
operator said it earned $803,000 in the second quarter, contrasted with a loss 
of $27.9 million in the quarter a year ago. Revenue was flat at $109 million. 
The company said a key reason for the improvement was the fact that interest 
payments on its debt were suspended while it tries to emerge from Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection.

Mercury Savings &amp; Loan: The Huntington Beach thrift lost $53 million during 
the first quarter, or as much as the thrift lost in 1988 and 1989 combined, 
according to records released by federal regulators Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But according to figures compiled by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, 
the thrift took a $56.8-million writeoff of assets during the quarter, the main 
reason for the loss. The S&amp;L has nearly $2 billion in assets. An 
unexpectedly large number of homeowners paid off mortgages early, leaving 
Mercury with losses.

'SUN UP' SIGNS OFF WITH GRACE, STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The final episode of "Sun Up San Diego," which aired Friday, was much like the 
thousands of episodes that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo brought animals. Co-host Kathi Diamant smiled constantly, 
hugging members of the studio audience. Her partner, Jerry G. Bishop, sang his 
own version of "Yesterday." Natasha Josefewitz read a poem. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, though, the show had the warmth and relaxed atmosphere that has 
symbolized "Sun Up" for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In its three-decade history, San Diego's morning talk show has not been 
aggressive like "Donahue" or "Geraldo," nor was it a tabloid like "Sally Jessy 
Raphael." 
</P>
<P>
"Sun Up" was representative of the kind of old-time television programs that 
once were chauvinistically termed women's shows in the industry. It included 
cooking segments and friendly chats with celebrities. A few self-help tips were 
usually included. 
</P>
<P>
It was a kinder, gentler talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Although not all the regulars and celebrities were available for Friday's 
program, they were there in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation came after ratings for the show slumped during the past year, 
but that didn't deter more than 100 people from gathering in the KFMB studio to 
wish the show a fond farewell. Those tuning into the program for the first time 
may not have understood the self-congratulatory and lackadaisical tone of the 
final program, but it was quintessential "Sun Up." 
</P>
<P>
Not much happened. People talked to each other and the hosts joked around, 
trying desperately to keep things lively. 
</P>
<P>
The final show brought together five "Sun Up" alumni, including Bob Mills, the 
program's first host. He brought the show's concept to San Diego when he moved 
here from Tulsa, Okla., in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
The other ex-hosts on hand were Sue White, Mel Knoepp, Danuta and Shane, all of 
whom shared memories of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Not nearly enough vintage video clips were shown, but everyone told more than 
enough stories to satiate the audience. Danuta fondly recalled the day she was 
talked into diving into the killer whale pool at Sea World. White's favorite 
was the time Mills apparently forgot they were on live television, and turned 
to her and said, "Oh hell, it's time for the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The studio atmosphere felt like a reunion. Many friends of Diamant and Bishop 
were in the audience, and, during breaks, the hosts walked through the crowd 
sharing greetings. Others in the crowd were simply fans who had spent many 
mornings with the show. Several said they had seen the first "Sun Up" episode. 
</P>
<P>
One woman held up a sign: "Like the southern belle she is, Kathi Diamant will 
rise again." 
</P>
<P>
Dan and Nicola Bernard were on hand to reminisce about their wedding, which 
"Sun Up" aired live in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
At least four public relations executives also attended. Through the years, 
"Sun Up" has provided a willing forum to spotlight their clients. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Sun Up' was a public relations person's dream," said Nikki Symington, who 
owns a local company. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that an hour was not going to be enough time for all the 
reminiscing the audience and hosts wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Diamant, who was clearly working to control herself, finally broke into tears 
when Bishop sang "Yesterday," as a montage of old photos of Bishop appeared on 
the screen. She cried more when producer Pat Elwood joined them on stage, along 
with the past hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they ran a collection of clips, shots of the younger Bishop and 
Diamant and the other hosts cavorting with guests. 
</P>
<P>
And then, after 30 years, it was over.

WILDFIRES FORCE VISITORS OUT OF YOSEMITE VALLEY 
</P>

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoke obscured the view of Half Dome and the floor of Yosemite Valley turned 
eerily still Friday as wildfires raging out of control in the park forced the 
first-ever summer evacuation of all campsites and lodgings, including the ritzy 
Ahwahnee Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people -- including a few thousand day visitors trapped overnight 
Thursday in the valley when fires closed all three exit highways -- left in an 
orderly caravan that began at 6:30 a.m. By 10 a.m. the roads were clear of cars 
and campers, the meadows free of hikers and the parking lots all but empty. 
</P>
<P>
The fires, which were ignited by lightning on Thursday, were still burning out 
of control and had charred more than 12,000 acres of forest, most of it safely 
removed from park areas most familiar to visitors. There was no immediate 
threat to Yosemite Valley. Sixty-six buildings in and near the small settlement 
of Foresta were destroyed, at least 27 of them private homes, said park 
spokesman Don Fox. 
</P>
<P>
All roads into Yosemite remained closed to the public Friday. The park is not 
expected to reopen before late Sunday, and firefighters still have no estimate 
of when they will gain control of the two main flanks of flame racing through 
thick forests on the west side of Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
"We are nowhere near containment of the fires right now," U.S. Forest Service 
spokesman Dave Balough said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fire, the one in the Foresta area, has burned 7,000 acres from 
California 140 near El Portal, just outside the park, to the Crane Flat section 
of the Yosemite high country. Another 5,021 acres have burned west of the 
Chinquapin junction inside Yosemite. About 850 firefighters are on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
At Foresta, a small "in-holding" town of private homes that was annexed to the 
park decades ago, the toll included the home of Shirley Sargent, an unofficial 
park archivist whose chronicles of Yosemite lore are widely available in the 
park. Her extensive collection of books, artifacts and historical items was 
lost, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Also lost were a historic sawmill and log barn in the McCauley Ranch area near 
Foresta. Only 18 structures were left unscathed in the Foresta community, Fox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone. The fire just wiped it out," firefighter Richard Heiskell said of 
the settlement. "We were hearing people's propane tanks exploding. When the 
fire came in, it was like -- I don't know, a little bit of hell." 
</P>
<P>
Foresta was safely evacuated before the fire swept through and no one was 
injured. Several high country campgrounds have also been evacuated, but the big 
Tuolumne Meadows campground and others not in the immediate area of the fires 
remain open though unreachable due to the closed highways. 
</P>
<P>
Steep terrain and swirling winds driven by summer thunderstorms above the 
Sierra Nevada made the firefighting effort treacherous. Crews coming down off 
the lines talked of fire storms and close calls. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Pearce was commander of the first crew to fight the Foresta area fire and 
expressed amazement at its rapid spread Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody in their right mind would have thought this would 
happen," Pearce said. "There was no indication it would blow up like it did." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon Thursday, a wall of blowing flames overran about 100 
firefighters in Foresta Meadow, Pearce said. They formed a circle of fire 
engines and took refuge in the center of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like 'round up the wagons,' " Pearce said. Another firefighter, Beth 
Healy, said, "You could see fire shooting 100 feet over the trees, which can be 
150 feet tall." 
</P>
<P>
Erratic, gusting winds snapped burning embers off the main fire and scattered 
them over ridges, touching off new hot spots. The fire also moved on the small 
town of El Portal, just outside the Arch Rock entrance to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Medley, president of the Yosemite Assn., was in El Portal when the fire 
came over a ridge and spilled down Crane Creek toward the town on California 
140. The fire was being pushed by unusual swirling winds. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen winds like that here," Medley said Friday from his home in 
Oakhurst, where he was monitoring the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Back-fires set by forestry crews turned back the advance before it could claim 
any buildings in El Portal. But the flames racing through the forest unloosed 
boulders and debris that fell on the highway, cutting off that last route out 
of Yosemite for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Kaunart, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, described the flames 
Thursday as "extremely intense fire behavior. It literally blew up." 
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions were better Friday and more firefighters were on hand, but 
not nearly as many as Yosemite officials had requested. Other fires in 
California and the West had strained the forces of fire agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen serious wildfires were being fought in California Friday, most set by 
the lightning storms that lit up the Sierra Nevada and other areas earlier in 
the week. Sensors plugged into fire-observation computers counted more than 
21,000 lightning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Two fires in Lassen County had burned 12,500 acres and a fire in Tehama County 
had charred 39,000 acres. In all, more than 100,000 acres of forest and brush 
have burned in the state this week. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the improved conditions at Yosemite Friday, the mood was cautious 
because of the terrain and the dryness of the trees after four years of 
drought, Kaunart said. 
</P>
<P>
"The forest is virtually ready to explode in flames," he said. "Firefighters 
are up against the very worst extremes." 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite Ranger Dave Lattimore said the conditions have not approached those 
that fed the disastrous Yellowstone National Park fires two summers ago. But he 
said efforts at Yosemite are crippled by the park's limit of three radio 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Communication is the worst I've seen on any fire ever," Lattimore said. "We 
just don't have the radio frequencies in this park to deal with a major fire." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to evacuate Yosemite Valley was made about midnight Thursday. Park 
officials said there was no fire threat to the valley, but the evacuation was 
ordered in part because there is typically a three-day supply of food on hand. 
With the roads closed indefinitely, the arrival of new supplies could not be 
guaranteed. Officials also wanted employees free to fight fires, not looking 
out for the safety of stranded tourists. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 a.m. Friday, employees began awakening people in lodges, campgrounds, 
cabins and the Ahwahnee, where rooms go for $200 and up a night, and giving 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone was assigned a departure time. Those in accommodations closest to the 
west end of the valley left first, east-end visitors and campers last. Rangers 
released a vehicle every six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It went extraordinarily smoothly," said John Poimoroo, marketing director for 
Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., which runs the lodging and concessions in the 
park. "Everyone was cooperative, and some even looked at it as an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
The day visitors who were stranded in the valley overnight slept in the 
visitors center, the elementary school or their cars. Others pitched tents on a 
school ball field. When the sun rose, they joined the caravan headed out of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, many had gathered at the Marriott Tenaya Lodge in Fish Camp, two 
miles outside the south entrance to the park on California 41. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ordered to leave last night and it was kind of a bummer not to see 
Yosemite," said Gina Bonner, 23, of Fresno. But she was not concerned about the 
fire, which was several miles to the north. "The fire seems a far enough 
distance from us for us to stay here and lay by the pool, drinking beer."

BUSH SAYS HUSSEIN IS 'BACKED INTO A CORNER'; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. RESPONSE: THE PRESIDENT SAYS IRAQI MOVE WILL FAIL. HIS SPOKESMAN CITES 
PLANS FOR A NAVAL BLOCKADE.

<P>
President Bush dismissed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's declaration of a holy 
war as a "frantic ploy" of a "cornered radical" Friday as Bush's spokesman 
announced that plans are being made for a blockade to seal off Iraqi trade. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Maine from Washington to 
begin his annual summer vacation, Bush said he is confident that Hussein's move 
will fail to bring about an uprising throughout the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't worry about that," said Bush, looking tired but showing none of the 
flashes of anger that marked his public appearances at the start of the latest 
Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"He's backed into a corner. Most of the Arab countries violently disapprove of 
what he's done. He doesn't have many options, so he's resorting to radical 
rhetoric trying to mobilize opinion. His problem is everybody sees through 
this," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
As the United States and its allies continued to try to tighten the economic 
noose around Iraq, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said preparations for 
a naval blockade are under way. "We still think it's premature to talk about 
any specifics, but we want to be prepared if it should become necessary," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the subject, Bush said he was "not prepared to use the word 
blockade, but I am prepared to say that we will do whatever is necessary to see 
that the exports from Iraq . . . do not go forward." 
</P>
<P>
"I would advise Iraqi ships not to go out with oil," he added. 
</P>
<P>
One major worry that U.S. planners face in devising a blockade is evidence that 
Iraq has set up a base in Kuwait for firing Silkworm anti-ship missiles at 
vessels in the Persian Gulf. The Chinese-made missiles, with a 60-mile range, 
could be used to attack warships as they attempt to stop vessels in the gulf 
from approaching Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Washington, Bush formally notified Congress of the deployment of 
U.S. troops to defend Saudi Arabia. The notification was designed to be 
"consistent" with the requirements of the War Powers Act, but was not formally 
made under the act, the White House said, a bit of legal technicality designed 
to underscore Bush's position that the act infringes on the President's 
constitutional powers as commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent," Bush wrote. "To the 
contrary, it is my belief that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful 
resolution of the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Bush said he has seen no evidence "that Saddam Hussein 
would be foolish enough to cross that border" between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's assessment was backed by U.S. intelligence, which indicates the Iraqis 
are digging into positions in Kuwait, preparing for an extended war of nerves 
rather than an attack against U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Their window of opportunity closed several days ago," one knowledgeable 
Administration official said. "We don't think they'll move." He said the U.S. 
assessment that the Iraqis do not plan to attack Saudi Arabia is "strengthened 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi troops in Kuwait today are more concerned about an outside attack on 
them than they are in plotting an offensive," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said the Iraqis now have 150,000 soldiers in Kuwait, 
with another 20,000 men in southern Iraq moving toward Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fraction of the total in Kuwait -- perhaps fewer than 15,000 -- are 
positioned directly on the border with Saudi Arabia. These troops are digging 
defensive fortifications and undertaking other actions that lead government 
analysts to conclude they are not preparing an attack. 
</P>
<P>
On the Saudi side of the border, American forces deployed for Operation Desert 
Shield are growing rapidly as additional troops prepare to head for the Persian 
Gulf, apparently including 4,000 Marines from the 7th Marine Amphibious Brigade 
at Twentynine Palms, the desert base southeast of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
But while American officials discounted the likelihood of a direct attack by 
Hussein's forces, they have become increasingly candid about the possibility of 
indirect attacks by terrorists against American interests. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department notified American embassies around the world to be on the 
alert for threats, although deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the 
government so far had "no specific information available at this time 
concerning such terrorist operations." 
</P>
<P>
"If specific, credible information on a threat to the public is received, the 
Department of State will provide information for travelers and other concerned 
parties," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what advice he would offer Americans worried about travel, Bush said, 
"I'd say don't go to Iraq right now. How's that? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't go to Kuwait. You'll find it difficult to land," he added. "I'd say to 
Americans, 'Be careful about travel to certain areas right now. You could well 
see terrorist groups try to capitalize on this,' " Bush added. But, he said, 
"I'm not prepared to say nobody should travel any place in the Middle East. I'm 
not prepared to say that at all. I'd be careful where ever you go these days." 
</P>
<P>
For the Americans and other Westerners caught in Iraq and Kuwait, the situation 
has not changed, Boucher said. Iraq's borders remain closed to those trying to 
leave. Thirty-eight Americans detained at Baghdad's Rashid hotel were visited 
Friday by an American diplomat, a daily ritual since the Iraqi army brought 
them from Kuwait city. Penelope Nabokov, a 10-year-old from Albany, Calif., 
remains at the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 10 staff members and dependents from the Baghdad embassy will try 
again to cross the border today after being rebuffed on their first attempt 
Thursday, Boucher said. On the Jordanian side of the frontier, U.S. Embassy 
representatives will be waiting to help them get to Amman. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, where an estimated 3,000 Americans remain, the U.S. Embassy has 
contacted 900 citizens. While conditions are unsettled in Kuwait city, there 
have been no reports of harassment or threats to Americans living there. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis, however, have told countries with embassies in Kuwait that the 
posts must be closed in two weeks, saying that because Kuwait is now a part of 
Iraq, separate embassies are unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Brussels, North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers 
rejected that demand, calling the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the United States is taking note of the fact that many non-Western 
foreigners have been allowed to leave Iraq and Kuwait despite the Iraqi 
government's assertion that "security conditions" made it unsafe for Westerners 
to depart. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Marines from Twentynine Palms, elements of the Army's 24th 
Mechanized Infantry Division -- about 2,300 troops equipped with artillery, 
armored vehicles and tank-killing attack helicopters -- were bound for the 
Mideast, going from their base at Ft. Stewart, Ga., to the port of Savannah to 
begin boarding the Navy's fast sea lift ship Capella for deployment to Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Air Force F-16 fighters from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., and C-130 
transport planes from Pope Air Force Base, N.C., began arriving in Saudi Arabia 
to join F-15 fighters that were deployed earlier in the week, the Pentagon 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to protect the troops, the Navy announced it had 
activated two hospital ships -- the Mercy, based in Oakland, and the Comfort, 
based in Baltimore -- for deployment to the area. About 1,200 personnel from 
Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland are being transferred to the Mercy, while 
doctors and nurses from Bethesda Naval Hospital in the Washington suburbs will 
staff the Comfort, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Comfort was an oil tanker until it underwent a $200-million reconstruction 
completed in 1988. It is now one of the 10 largest hospitals in the United 
States, complete with operating rooms, intensive-care beds, a pharmacy, blood 
bank and a decontamination area for troops exposed to chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner, a Pentagon spokesman, would not discuss the overall 
numbers of troops to be deployed to Saudi Arabia, but the forces already 
announced will amount to more than 9,000. Pentagon officials have said no upper 
limit has been set on an eventual troop deployment that will number in the tens 
of thousands. The size of the American force will depend in part on commitments 
of troops by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a substantial force, and others will be coming in with more forces, 
too," Bush said, referring to the effort to present an international military 
operation to demonstrate global opposition to the Iraqi invasion. "Our fighting 
men that are on the ground there will be safe." 
</P>
<P>
But the President said he could provide no estimate of how long the troops will 
be needed or of how much the deployment will cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, I'd love to see the economic sanctions be so successful that the 
forces could be withdrawn. And I think they will be successful. My problem is, 
I just can't estimate the time right now, how long it will take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for a price tag, Bush said he had asked advisers to provide a cost estimate 
Wednesday evening, and "we're beginning now to get some hard estimates on 
this." 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of the cost, "You can't say, 'I'm not going to do this because 
of the arts, or education, or the drug fight, or whatever,' " he said. "This is 
something that is in the national interest, and it is essential that we do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Defense Information, a Washington-based organization that is 
often critical of the Pentagon budget, estimated that the deployment will cost 
$14.6 million per day above the normal operating costs for the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will meet in Kennebunkport today with National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who returned to the United 
States on Friday night after meeting with Turkish leaders in Ankara and NATO 
foreign ministers in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The briefing is expected to review plans for establishing a naval blockade of 
ports through which Iraqi trade is conducted, particularly the Red Sea ports of 
Aqaba, in Jordan, and Muajjiz in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf ports of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Pentagon announced Friday that a U.S. media "pool" made up of 
representatives from several major print and broadcast organizations would be 
sent to Saudi Arabia over the weekend to report on U.S. forces there. 
</P>
<P>
A second pool made up of American reporters already in the Middle East will be 
formed to visit U.S. ships in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working to get the pool in there as quickly as possible," Pentagon 
spokesman Pete Williams said.

JUDGE RULES DEA KIDNAP VIOLATED U.S.-MEXICO PACT; 
</P>
<P>
CAMARENA CASE: IN PRECEDENT-SETTING DECISION, REPATRIATION IS ORDERED FOR 
DOCTOR ACCUSED IN MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a precedent-setting decision, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled Friday 
that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's kidnaping of a Mexican doctor 
violated the United States' extradition treaty with Mexico and ordered the 
defendant in the Enrique Camarena murder trial returned to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision, if it stands, could impede the DEA in its quest to 
apprehend all the individuals believed involved in Camarena's 1985 murder, 
which infuriated his fellow agents and touched off a five-year investigation 
still under way called Operation Leyenda. 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that the United States violated its extradition treaty with 
Mexico when it unilaterally abducted" Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, said U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie. "This court lacks jurisdiction to try this 
defendant." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered the government to release Alvarez, who is accused of 
administering drugs to Camarena while he was being tortured by his captors, and 
repatriate him. Rafeedie stayed his order for one week after Assistant U.S. 
Atty. William Fahey asked for time to consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie also warned the DEA that similar violations of a nation's sovereignty 
will not be tolerated even when they have been initiated to curb international 
drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that three of the eight people who have been arrested in the 
United States stemming from the investigation of Camarena's murder in 
Guadalajara, Mexico, have been forcibly brought to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In its laudable efforts to pursue the killers of Enrique Camarena and halt the 
flow of drugs, the DEA is, by its repeated abductions, inviting the exercise of 
the court's supervisory powers in the greater interest of maintaining respect 
for the law," the judge said in a warning to the DEA that he might throw out 
future charges against people brought to the United States against their will. 
</P>
<P>
Several other Mexican nationals have been indicted here in the Camarena case, 
but their extradition has not been requested because Mexico traditionally 
resists extradition of its citizens and U.S. Justice Department officials 
thought that such requests would be futile. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors as well as Alvarez's lawyer appeared stunned by Rafeedie's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm flabbergasted," said Robert K. Steinberg, Alvarez's lawyer, who filed a 
motion in May asking that his client be released on the grounds that his 
kidnaping constituted "outrageous government misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said Alvarez, a 43-year-old Guadalajara gynecologist, felt "numb." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials, who have vehemently protested the kidnaping as a violation 
of their country's sovereignty, reacted with delight. 
</P>
<P>
"What great news for us!" exclaimed Otto Granados, a spokesman for President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. "This is an appropriate response on the part of the 
United States. Not only is the judicial branch complying with the law, but in 
doing so it reinforces what we consider to be a code of ethics and fair play. 
It is a good atmosphere for U.S.-Mexican relations." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles declined comment, as did Hector Berrellez, 
the DEA agent who heads the Camarena investigation in Los Angeles. Berrellez 
approved the kidnaping plan. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was spirited out of Guadalajara on April 2, by a group of Mexican men 
with close ties to a Los Angeles-based DEA operative, Antonio Garate 
Bustamante, who worked under Berrellez's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Garate and Berrellez testified that about $60,000 had been paid to the 
kidnapers. Berrellez testified that the operation had been approved all the way 
up the line with his supervisors in Los Angeles and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a DEA spokesman said he hoped the Justice Department would appeal 
the decision. A Justice Department spokesman said there would be no comment 
until the agency's lawyers had read the judge's 39-page decision. 
</P>
<P>
However, a department source insisted that no one in U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh's office was advised in advance of the plan that succeeded in 
bringing Alvarez across the border. The source said that Thornburgh learned of 
the operation only after Alvarez was brought to El Paso, Tex., on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared to contradict remarks Rafeedie made from the bench and 
in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The DEA gave the go-ahead for the abduction," the judge said. "This command 
was approved at the highest levels of the DEA. The United States attorney 
general's office was consulted." 
</P>
<P>
He specifically rejected a contention raised by Fahey in May that the DEA was 
not responsible because its agents did not personally kidnap Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is responsible for the actions of its paid agents," the 
judge said. ". . . The record reveals that the DEA and its informants were 
integrally involved" in the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie indicated that his decision broke new ground. He said that he could 
find no other case exactly like this one. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Alvarez ruling, Rafeedie had issued a decision just last month 
spurning a similar plea from another defendant in the Camarena case, Juan Ramon 
Matta Ballesteros, who was forcibly apprehended in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in 
April, 1988, by a combination of U.S. and Honduran forces. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1886, U.S. law has generally held that a forcible abduction does not 
offend due process and does not require that a court dismiss an indictment for 
the loss of jurisdiction on those grounds, Rafeedie said. But the judge said 
there was a vital distinction between the Alvarez case and all the other 
federal cases on this subject that have been issued since 1886. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction, Rafeedie emphasized, is that the Mexican government 
registered a formal diplomatic protest with the U.S. State Department. He said 
that Mexico sent three diplomatic letters to the State Department protesting 
the kidnaping as a violation of Mexican sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that in all the other cases he reviewed of a foreign national 
seeking dismissal of charges after being brought forcibly to the United States, 
the governments of the other countries had approved of or acquiesced in the 
kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
Experts on international law said Rafeedie's decision, if upheld on appeal, 
would be significant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first case that I know of where someone has been ordered by a U.S. 
judge to be sent back on the basis of a violation of an extradition treaty," 
said John Murphy, professor of international law at Villanova University in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on Jan. 31. The 
indictment stated that he came to a house owned by Mexican drug lord Rafael 
Caro Quintero where Camarena was being tortured and administered drugs to the 
DEA agent so he could be revived for further interrogation. He was charged with 
five felonies, including conspiracy and murder. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony given at a May 25 hearing in federal court revealed that the DEA had 
attempted to have Alvarez turned over by Mexican authorities in a prisoner swap 
before he was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Garate testified that the negotiations between the DEA and Mexican officials 
began in December, 1989, when he was contacted by Mexican Federal Judicial 
Police Commandant Jorge Castillo del Rey. He said that Castillo wanted to 
arrange a swap in which the United States would get Alvarez and the Mexicans 
would Isaac Naredo Moreno, a Mexican fugitive living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached, according to testimony by Berrellez and Garate, the 
former head of the Guadalajara riot police and one-time associate of Mexican 
drug lord Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. But the arrangement broke down when Mexican 
officials demanded $50,000 in expense money, Garate said. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Garate told Berrellez that he had friends in Mexico who could 
kidnap Alvarez and bring him to the United States. Berrellez told Garate to 
inform his associates he DEA would pay a $50,000 reward plus expenses if they 
could deliver Alvarez to agents in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On April 2, six men, some brandishing police badges, stormed into Alvarez's 
office and took him away. The next day he was flown to El Paso and turned over 
to DEA agents, one of whom was Berrellez. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, Alvarez was charged in Mexico with crimes stemming from Camarena's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said that to the best of his knowledge his client was not involved in 
drug trafficking, though he acknowledged Alvarez had been a physician for Caro. 
</P>
<P>
"This man is incapable of a violent act," Steinberg said. "He's a jolly buffoon 
who liked to hang around with the big guys. It was an honor to be invited to 
Caro Quintero's rancho. . . . He enjoyed being important and being invited to 
the house, but half the state did, including the governor of Jalisco."

MAGELLAN PROBE MANEUVERS INTO ORBIT OF VENUS

After its 15-month journey from Earth, the Magellan spacecraft, a planetary 
probe cobbled together from leftover pieces of other projects, slipped into a 
perfect orbit around Venus Friday morning, providing NASA with an emotional 
high in its long summer of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver required the spacecraft to fire its solid-rocket motor while it 
was behind Venus and out of touch with human controllers at Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. Project scientists spent a tense 21 minutes until the spacecraft 
emerged again at 10:06 a.m., signaling a successful firing and precipitating 
high fives, bearhugs and prolonged clapping. Had the solid rocket not fired, 
the craft would have sailed past the planet at 25,000 miles per hour and been 
lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, Magellan will start radar mapping the cloud-shrouded surface 
of our sister planet, painting a portrait more detailed than what is available 
even for much of the Earth, which is shielded from such mapping by its oceans. 
At its low point, the spacecraft will sweep within 186 miles of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The flight to the hot, dry planet and insertion into orbit went so smoothly, 
JPL researchers said, that Magellan was left with a large excess of fuel for 
its maneuvering rockets, enough to keep it in operation for 30 years, decades 
longer than had been projected. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is the first of several planetary probes already launched or in 
preparation that will give the United States operating observatories around 
other objects in the solar system -- including Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, asteroids 
and comets -- well into the next century. "We are back in the planetary 
exploration business," said JPL's Steve Wall. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after the successful rocket firing, NASA associate 
administrator Lennard A. Fisk shrugged off questions about NASA's short-term 
grounding of its shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks. Instead he focused on 
the successful Venus flyby of Galileo earlier this year, the launches of the 
Cosmic Background Explorer observatory last November and the Gamma-Ray 
Observatory in June and the upcoming launch of Ulysses into a solar orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is not the first spacecraft to reach Venus. Soviet and American probes 
have preceded it, and two of the Soviet probes even landed on the surface, 
transmitting pictures of a parched, cracked landscape. But those pictures only 
covered the area immediately surrounding the craft's landing site. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have also used cloud-piercing radar to map the upper quarter of the 
planet, and U.S. scientists have employed the massive Arecibo radio observatory 
to map the entire planet, but only very crudely. In both cases, the resolution 
was sufficient only to pick out objects the size of 10 football fields, just 
enough "to whet our appetites," said JPL's Bob MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan, in contrast, will be able to image objects the size of a single 
football field, providing unprecedented clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope that by observing Venus in great detail, they will be able to 
learn about not only its past but Earth's as well. Venus is very nearly Earth's 
twin in size, but its surface temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and its 
atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth, indicating that two planets 
took different paths in a very early stage of planetary evolution. 
</P>
<P>
The sweltering temperature of Venus is caused by the high concentration of 
carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, which permits the sun's heat to pass through 
and warm the planet but prevents heat from escaping back into space. 
Researchers are predicting a similar, albeit less disastrous, "greenhouse 
effect" on Earth because of continued release of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"From looking at places like Venus, we can . . . know more about what might 
happen on Earth," said Gentry Lee of JPL. 
</P>
<P>
But geologists are especially interested in studying the surface of Venus, 
which "is completely unlike anything seen on Earth or Mars," according to JPL's 
Stephen Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist. Because so much of the Earth's 
crust is obscured by oceans, geologists have a hard time interpreting many of 
its features. The study of Venus should give insight into Earth's crustal 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know a lot more about that planet to understand our own," Saunders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers will have to wait a little longer. Spacecraft controllers will 
spend the next three weeks checking Magellan's systems and flexing its radar 
unit. The actual mapping will begin Aug. 29 if no adjustment to its orbit is 
necessary, as now seems likely, or Sept. 1 if adjustment is required. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan will spend about a third of each 3.2-hour orbit mapping a narrow swath 
of Venus about 16 miles wide. During the remainder of the orbit, the data will 
be radioed to Earth. The spacecraft will require one Venus day -- 243 Earth 
days -- to map about 80% of its surface, all but the south pole. 
</P>
<P>
During that phase, Magellan will radio back to Earth more data than all the 
previous planetary probes combined. 
</P>
<P>
Following this primary mission, the spacecraft will enter an extended mission 
in which it will map the remaining 20% of the planet and go back over 
interesting parts of the surface to provide stereoscopic images. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite and its operation for the next year will cost NASA $551 million. 
Counting the cost of its launch by the shuttle Atlantis, the total cost of the 
mission is $744 million. An additional $169 million will be necessary to keep 
it in operation through 1995.

ISRAEL ADOPTING SOFTER POLICY TOWARD UPRISING; 
</P>
<P>
OCCUPATION: DEATHS OF PALESTINIANS DECLINE SHARPLY AS NEW DEFENSE MINISTER 
ARENS SHOWS HE PREFERS THAT THE ARMY USE LESS PROVOCATIVE TACTICS.

<P>
Israel's military posture has been strengthened by a new, softer policy toward 
the Palestinian uprising, military sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, never publicly announced, was adopted by Moshe Arens after he took 
over as minister of defense in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
It is described as "more carrot than stick," and it has resulted in a sharp 
decline in the number of Palestinian deaths attributed to troops patrolling the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"This means we can turn our attention to the real enemy, those Arab nations 
full of hate with strong armies arrayed against us," Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, 
the chief military spokesman, told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian casualties are at present about a third of what they were in 1988 
and 1989, Israeli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No senior military officer believes that the intifada, as the uprising is 
called in Arabic, is ending, or that Palestinians are any more inclined to 
accept the Israeli occupation. But military officials said Friday that the 
declining trend in casualties suggests the army can devote more time and energy 
to preparing for conventional warfare. 
</P>
<P>
And that, rather than concentrating on anti-uprising tactics, is what is 
needed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) should not train its soldiers to fight against 
stone-throwing boys and girls," Gen. Shai said. "They should be trained to 
fight a future war." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli army figures show that in July only three Palestinians were killed in 
the occupied territories. In June, no deaths were reported as the result of 
army action in the volatile Gaza Strip, although in the West Bank eight 
Palestinians were shot to death by soldiers. Figures supplied by Palestinian 
sources are somewhat higher. 
</P>
<P>
The July casualty figures are the lowest since the intifada began in December, 
1987, according to the IDF. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in Palestinian casualties can be attributed in part to the general 
slowing down of the uprising. And Palestinian leaders agree that the pace has 
slowed. 
</P>
<P>
But IDF sources think the decline in violence is also a direct result of 
Defense Minister Arens' policies, which differ sharply from those of his 
predecessor, former Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, who ordered Palestinians beaten if they 
raised a hand against soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers had thought that the new, right-wing defense minister would be 
even tougher than Rabin in cracking down on the uprising. But as an Arens aide 
said, "Our policy in the territories is to hit less and talk more." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Shai, a veteran war correspondent before taking over as chief IDF 
spokesman, said troops are given clear instructions before going on duty in the 
occupied territories. No longer, he said, do small units go deep into the Arab 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't send small, unprotected jeep patrols into heavily populated areas," 
he said. "Small patrols, when surrounded, were faced with three options, to run 
away, to hit back, or to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Those options had led to unnecessary casualties, he said, and added: 
</P>
<P>
"We have instructed our troops to be much more careful in their approach to 
Palestinian residents. If we see a hundred people getting together now for a 
funeral, a wedding, a parade, we let them alone. We don't interfere. We take it 
easy during mourning periods. 
</P>
<P>
"If they raise a Palestinian flag, we don't worry too much. We are trying to 
avoid incitement, to avoid provocation, because that just plays into the hands 
of those who want violence. Our instructions are to avoid clashes when not 
necessary. We don't arrest women." 
</P>
<P>
Shai, 44, was offered the unenviable job of army spokesman, military sources 
said, because the government finally realized how tarnished the IDF image had 
become, at home and abroad, as the result of pictures and articles dealing with 
the beating and shooting of unarmed Palestinian men, women and children.

2 REBEL FORCES ADVANCE AGAINST DOE IN LIBERIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Competing Liberian rebel groups advanced on two fronts against President Samuel 
K. Doe's executive mansion Friday, and one group claimed it narrowly missed 
killing him in an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels led by Prince Johnson fortified positions in Monrovia's city center 
while men under command of his rival, Charles Taylor, advanced in the capital's 
eastern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups were maneuvering in a last-ditch bid to topple Doe before West 
African peacekeepers arrive to impose a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson claimed his men narrowly missed assassinating Doe on Thursday when they 
ambushed his car less than a mile from the mansion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Doe with my own eyes," said a rebel who gave his name as Battlefield. He 
said he fired at Doe's blue Peugeot near the Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Doe on Thursday accused U.S. Marines of trying to assassinate him, but the 
State Department in Washington denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists saw Taylor's soldiers push through Monrovia's eastern suburbs 
toward the fortress-like mansion where the besieged president is clinging to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also was quoted as saying his men had beaten back an attack by 100 
Taylor rebels on his rear flank near Monrovia Free Port. 
</P>
<P>
"If Taylor brings 50 million men, I don't care," Johnson said. "If they are not 
tactically trained, they run away." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose 10,000 fighters represent the largest army in the country, is 
opposed to intervention by the West African force. 
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers, meanwhile, were mobilizing in five countries. They planned to 
sail into Monrovia from neighboring Sierra Leone, but no date for their arrival 
has been announced. Nigerian forces were expected to leave for Sierra Leone 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia's Congo Town suburb on Friday, two rockets hit St. Joseph's 
Catholic Hospital, according to a radio communication from relief workers. It 
was not known if anyone was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 ambulatory patients fled the hospital, according to a spokesman 
for a European relief agency. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Monrovia said Taylor has ordered everyone to leave the hospital.

DIPLOMACY: TURKEY WINS A PROMISE FROM KUWAIT'S EMIR THAT COULD BE WORTH 
BILLIONS. BUT FENCE-SITTING JORDAN COULD BE A BIG LOSER.

In the 10 days since the invasion of Kuwait, American officials have combined 
promises of American friendship, offers of Kuwaiti money and the threat of 
Iraqi aggression to broker a series of deals that have cemented support for the 
drive against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the biggest beneficiary seems to have been Turkey. In a series of 
telephone calls last weekend and a visit by Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III on Thursday, President Bush and his aides acted as middlemen in a deal that 
could bring billions of dollars to the Turks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, whose existence Bush confirmed Friday, Kuwait's ousted emir -- 
who still controls billions of dollars of oil-generated wealth -- will 
reimburse the Turks for losses incurred from shutting off the flow of Iraqi oil 
and trade. The deal will bring Turkey roughly $460 million in each of the next 
four years, a source familiar with the transactions said. 
</P>
<P>
In rallying a worldwide response to Iraqi aggression, Bush and his aides have 
invoked high moral principles and overriding precepts of global security. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in the bazaar or the souk," said a senior U.S. official who has been 
a key Bush adviser during the crisis. "This is a common shared necessity." 
</P>
<P>
But although those factors have played a major role in the extraordinary 
international support Bush has received so far, the Administration has not 
neglected appeals to more practical interests as it sought to bring allies on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
These quickly negotiated arrangements and the ties they create may play a part 
in U.S. foreign policy long after the confrontation with Iraq reaches its 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, for example, is expecting that in return for its support of the U.S. 
position on Iraq, the United States will support its bid to become further 
integrated into Europe. Turkey straddles Europe and Asia, but the main foreign 
policy goal of President Turgut Ozal's government has been to emphasize the 
country's European ties and play down its Asian roots. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made one rhetorical bow in that direction in his nationally broadcast 
speech Wednesday morning, saying that he was dispatching Baker "to Europe" to 
consult with Ozal in Ankara. In fact, Ankara is deep in the Asian part of 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, after allowing the United States use of its military bases, 
quickly won Bush's approval of sales of additional warplanes that Congress in 
the past had prevented the Saudis from buying. 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviets, who were quick to lend key support, are now in a stronger 
position to ask for U.S. concessions on issues important to them. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. officials talk about the crisis, "the tone about the Soviet Union is 
as if it were another ally, like France or Germany," said one congressional 
foreign policy expert. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, as the Soviets stood aside and allowed their former Eastern 
European satellites to throw off Communist rule, U.S. hostility toward the 
Soviet Union declined. But questions remain about whether the Soviets were 
willing to be "a constructive partner on behalf of collective security," the 
congressional aide said. "Now we have an affirmative act." 
</P>
<P>
Only a month ago, when Bush met with fellow leaders of major industrialized 
nations at the Houston economic summit, he fended off proposals for direct 
economic aid to the Soviets, fearing political opposition from American 
conservatives. The summit leaders agreed to re-examine the question later this 
year, and the Soviet role in the current crisis is likely to make the United 
States far more willing to consider aid, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the ledger, Jordan, a fence-sitter, could be a big loser. 
Although it has since expressed opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Jordan 
backed Iraq's Hussein in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Jordan's King Hussein has positioned himself as a moderate, 
pro-American force in the Middle East. In return, he has received military, 
political and economic support from the United States and Britain and extensive 
financial aid from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
But in the future, Middle East experts said, the Saudis and other gulf leaders 
are likely to reserve the bulk of their largess for those who were on their 
side in the current crisis. And in Congress, where Jordan has long been viewed 
as an American friend, support for King Hussein has evaporated. "I sure would 
not want to have to shepherd the next Jordanian arms sale through here," the 
congressional aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Saudi and Kuwaiti gratitude, and the billions of dollars worth 
of aid that could bring, are widely believed to be a major factor in the 
burgeoning support that the anti-Iraq effort has attracted from Arab leaders. 
</P>
<P>
How all of this will affect America's other major concern in the region -- 
Israel -- remains unclear. Some analysts believe that in return for their 
cooperation against Iraq, Arab leaders will demand greater U.S. pressure on 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Others discount that, contending that the crisis will strengthen U.S. support 
for Israel by demonstrating that the Israelis were correct in warning about 
Iraq's Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis also has had an impact on U.S. relations with its European allies. 
For the past several months, the Administration has been emphasizing its ties 
to Germany, a matter that has been deeply disturbing to British leaders, who 
have cultivated a "special relationship" with the United States ever since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But when the crisis broke, the first foreign leader to whom Bush turned was 
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In part, that was simply 
coincidence: Thatcher was in the United States to make a speech, and Bush 
already was planning to meet with her. 
</P>
<P>
But the swift meeting also reflected the reality that Britain was able to lend 
military and economic support to the U.S. effort. By contrast, even 45 years 
after the end of World War II, the idea of Germany sending troops to force its 
will on another country remains internationally unthinkable.

GORBACHEV URGES ARABS TO 'PUT OUT THE FIRE';

SOVIET UNION: IN HIS FIRST COMMENT ON PERSIAN GULF CRISIS, HE DENIES THAT 
MOSCOW HAS TURNED AGAINST IRAQ.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his first statement on the Persian 
Gulf crisis, called on Arab states Friday to "put out the fire" themselves and 
make outside intervention unnecessary. He denied that the Soviet Union has 
turned against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning," Gorbachev said, "the Soviet Union has taken a clear 
and consistent position on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. There is nothing 
anti-Iraqi in it. On the contrary, we strived to help Iraq find a way out of 
the situation it found itself in, with minimum losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this path was not taken," he added. "The crisis has worsened, 
prompting the Saudi Arabian leadership to request the U.S. government to deploy 
U.S. Army and aviation units in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, vacationing in the Soviet south, addressed his remarks to Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak, host to an emergency Arab League summit meeting Friday 
in Cairo. The text of Gorbachev's remarks was carried by the official Tass news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statement was free of the harsh criticism of Iraq that has been 
made by other Soviet officials and the state-run news media -- one newspaper 
branded the Kuwait invasion a "crime" -- it left no doubt that Gorbachev wants 
Iraq, a longtime Soviet ally, to pull its soldiers out of Kuwait immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Numerous examples show that a crisis in interstate relations, unless it is 
immediately localized and settled, gathers momentum like a stone falling from a 
rocky cliff," Gorbachev said. He asked the Arab League to begin "active work" 
to bring about an end to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, in an extraordinary example of superpower cooperation, the United 
States and the Soviet Union called jointly for a worldwide arms embargo against 
Iraq. Earlier, the Kremlin shut off the flow of weapons and ammunition that had 
made it Baghdad's top arms supplier for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Soviet government issued a statement that the Kremlin is ready 
to talk about the Persian Gulf crisis with military leaders of the United 
States, Britain, China and France -- members of the U.N. Security Council's 
Military Staff Committee. But Gorbachev assured Arab League states presumably 
jittery about outside military action that the Soviet Union wants them to 
settle the matter themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that efforts by Arab countries could play a major role in this 
common cause," he said. "Perhaps it is the most preferable path to take." 
</P>
<P>
At the Arab League summit, the leaders voted to recommend that Arab nations 
commit military forces to the defense of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and any other 
Arab land threatened with Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he is ready to "maintain constant contact" with Mubarak and 
other Arab leaders "to jointly seek a chance to put out the fire in the Persian 
Gulf, and restore peace and stability there." 
</P>
<P>
Although officials have ruled out Soviet participation in the U.S.-led force 
being deployed in Saudi Arabia, the superpowers are staying in touch. Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, talked about the gulf crisis by 
telephone Friday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, while the latter 
was in Brussels, Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has also drawn up plans for evacuating the 800 Soviet nationals 
living in Kuwait. Rear Adm. A. Karpin, deputy chief of the navy's political 
directorate, told the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) that the navy 
is "ready to evacuate its compatriots by sea, if such a task is set before it."

An immigration official at the border crossing between Jordan and Iraq told 
reporters Friday that no American or other Westerner had passed the frontier 
into Jordan for more than 24 hours, an apparent confirmation that Iraq has 
closed down exits for Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at the frontier said that a bus carrying an unspecified number of 
Americans was turned back by Iraqi officials overnight. On Friday, only 
foreigners of Arab origin were permitted to leave Iraq and cross into Jordan. 
Some of them had made the journey all the way from Kuwait and offered a few 
details of Iraq's invasion of that oil-rich Persian Gulf state. 
</P>
<P>
Two jeeps and a bus sent from the U.S. Embassy in Amman kept vigil at the 
border post. Five officials accompanying the vehicles declined to speak to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"No Westerners have come through since noon yesterday (Thursday)," said Abdul 
Rashid, the chief immigration officer on the Jordanian side of the border. 
"Today, only Arabs have come through." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Arabs were groups that traveled by road from Kuwait after being 
trapped by last week's Iraqi takeover. Members of one family reported being 
confined to their homes for two days as sporadic firing echoed through the 
city. Tanks roamed the streets and there was some looting, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee, a Lebanese, said Western embassies were in contact with many 
of their own citizens, "but my embassy did nothing for us. So, we just got into 
a car and left." 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian border crossing is at Rusaeiwed, which lies along a two-lane road 
that is the sole overland link between the two countries across a broad expanse 
of desert. Drivers must watch out for tumbleweed and herds of camels as they 
travel the road. Three immigration shacks stand on the Jordanian side, one of 
them decorated curiously inside with a mural depicting a London park replete 
with tulips. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic from Jordan into Iraq was fairly heavy Friday, with canvas-covered 
trucks streaming along the narrow highway. One shipment of new Toyota cars was 
seen crossing the border into Iraq, an indication that Jordan had not yet 
complied with the U.N. Security Council's ban on trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
While about 300 Arabs were traveling out of Iraq into Jordan on Friday, some 
Iraqis and other Arabs were going the other way, bound for Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The returnees were full of patriotic rhetoric. "The whole country is one army," 
said an Iraqi who crossed into his country together with his son. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of the United States," declared Jazam Razak. "There are no 
problems -- we can be friends." 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Ali, 40, a Jordanian who said he owned a supermarket in Baghdad, 
proclaimed that Jordan and Iraq will stand together as allies. "We are one 
people," he told reporters.

By a slight margin, the French want their armed forces to fight alongside the 
United States in the event of war with Iraq, according a poll released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Of 800 people surveyed this week by the IPSOS polling firm, 47% said they 
favored French participation in a multinational force if war broke out, while 
43% were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted for the weekly magazine Le Point, said 46% of the 
respondents hoped U.S. forces would confront Iraq directly, while 34% hoped 
this would not happen. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if they had confidence in President Francois Mitterrand's ability to 
serve French interests in his handling of the crisis, 59% said "yes" and 31% 
said "no." 
</P>
<P>
No margin of error for the poll was given.

France prepared to bolster its Persian Gulf forces to seven ships and 3,200 
military personnel Friday.

FAMILIES: TEARS, FEARS AND PRAYERS CONSUME THOSE AT HOME, POWERLESS TO FREE 
U.S. CITIZENS CAUGHT IN IRAQ'S GRIP.

The Americans trapped behind Iraqi lines technically may not be considered 
hostages, but their families and friends back home certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
All over America, people wait by telephones and watch television news, 
imprisoned by a rush of mixed emotions -- hope, fear, anger, frustration -- 
and, most of all, uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
In an all-too-familiar pattern that recalls the long nightmare of the American 
hostages in Iran, families here at home are looking for some word, any word, on 
the fate of Americans detained in Iraq and in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity has not bred ease in dealing with the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting any sleep," said Edwin Davis, a retired Baptist minister in 
Koran, La., whose daughter, Martha, was vacationing in Kuwait with her husband 
and two teen-age children when the Iraqis invaded. "We've just been moping 
around here and sticking close to the telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said his daughter, who is married to Kuwaiti-born Mahoud Ghareeb, an 
oil-field pumper, was staying at her mother-in-law's house when the war broke 
out. "She called at 4 a.m. on Aug. 2 and said they had been invaded and 
helicopters were flying over," Davis said. "They didn't know what was going on 
and, of course, neither did we." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Davis has heard nothing. "Not knowing is the torment," he said, 
stopping from time to time to compose himself. "If we could just hear 
something. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Some news does trickle out. It is said that Americans are safe, that some are 
even enjoying the swimming pool at a Baghdad hotel, that many are free to go 
from place to place -- but not to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 3,000 Americans are in Kuwait, along with at least another 
580 in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In Jacksboro, Tex., Marjorie Walterscheid is angry. Her husband, Rainard, an 
oil-drilling specialist for Santa Fe International, has been detained at a 
Baghdad hotel. She has heard nothing from him. 
</P>
<P>
"All the State Department ever says, when they do call, is that the men are 
fine and in good spirits," she said indignantly. "I ask you, if you were 
detained in a hotel, would you be in good spirits?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the detained Americans' employers try to gather and dispense 
information, but they run into difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, Calif., Debbie Williams, spokeswoman for the Parsons Corp., said 
that the firm has 12 Americans in Kuwait and that it is "piecing together 
whatever information we can." However, she said, "Our last direct contact with 
the employees" was Aug. 2, when "we were able to account for all of them, and 
they were all safe." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the waiting, rumors grow, along with fears of the worst. Relatives worry 
about the detainees' health and whether they will have such necessities as 
water and food. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday there were reports of water shortages," said Margit Omar of Los 
Angeles, whose 22-year-old son, Rayad, was visiting his father in Kuwait when 
the war began. Omar, a fine arts professor at USC, talking through tears, said 
she fears that an economic embargo of Iraq eventually will result in harm to 
Americans under Iraqi control. 
</P>
<P>
In "starving Iraq," she said, "the first thing we're going to starve is the 
people in Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, Suzie Trinh said her father, Randall Trinh, has worked in 
Kuwait as an engineer and consultant for the last 5 1/2 years. The family 
survived the fall of Saigon in 1975, making their way to America, she said, but 
now she is worried about her father's survival in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The big concern is that his health is not all that good," Trinh said. "He has 
an ulcer and high blood pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Several family members seemed stunned by the suddenness of events, noting that 
there had seemed to be no hints of trouble. Many also note that their relatives 
had long and good relations with Arabs and that some of those being detained 
are themselves of Arab descent. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin York of Mount Prospect, Ill., said his wife, Faye, two months pregnant, 
was visiting family and friends in Iraq and has not been heard from for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Faye York, who is of Iraqi descent, was trying to board a plane for home when 
she was told "the tickets were no good," said her husband. "She was crying and 
said she couldn't get on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
He had mixed feelings about how his wife's Iraqi background will affect her 
fate. "It could make it easier because she knows the language," he said. "She 
probably knows what's going on; but it could make it more difficult, because if 
they find out she's an American citizen and if they have something against Bush 
or something . . . you know?" 
</P>
<P>
The relatives find many ways to cope. As in the Iran hostage crisis, many 
people across the nation are stringing out yellow ribbons. And all are 
expressing hope. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Hanken moved to Kuwait, homeland of her husband, an investment broker, 
five years ago. In Monticello, Iowa, her mother, Nedra Hanken, said, "We're 
trying to stay positive, and until we find out differently, we will continue to 
feel she's all right." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the retired minister in Louisiana, said his church has started a "prayer 
chain" in which one church congregation prays for the family, then calls 
another church to pray, and so on. "I don't know what good yellow ribbons would 
do," he said. "I'd rather have prayers than ribbons." 
</P>
<P>
For most, the best salve is some word about their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
In Spring, Tex., Patricia Hale's spirits got a huge lift Friday when the State 
Department telephoned with a private message from her husband, Edward, a 
drilling supervisor for OGE Drilling who is being detained in a Baghdad hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The man from the embassy assured me that they had seen him and he was well," 
she said. "At least today will be easier. I'll carry that message with me, and 
it will get me through the day." 
</P>

L.A. RECORD EXECUTIVE MAY BE TRAPPED; 
</P>
<P>
CIVILIANS: HE WAS A TRANSIT PASSENGER AT KUWAITI AIRPORT WHEN THE IRAQIS 
INVADED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A longtime record-industry executive from Los Angeles is apparently one of the 
many Americans who have been trapped inside Kuwait since Iraqi military forces 
seized that small country on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Bhaskar Menon, chairman of the board of the International Federation of the 
Phonographic Industry and former chairman and chief executive of EMI Music 
Worldwide, was a transit passenger at Kuwait's international airport when Iraqi 
troops invaded in the early morning of Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He had made a business trip to London and was flying to India to meet his wife 
and two teen-age sons for a vacation when the British Airways plane on which he 
was a passenger landed at the Kuwaiti airport to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
According to friends and business colleagues in Los Angeles, the Iraqi invasion 
began just before the plane landed in Kuwait, and the airport was closed to all 
further operations 20 minutes after the plane touched ground. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Bush Administration said Iraq has stated that most of the 
3,000 American residents of Kuwait and 580 living in Iraq cannot leave and may 
be held indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"We are worried for his safety, very much so," said Menon's longtime secretary, 
Connie Bufalini. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans who work in that part of the world know the risks. But when you are 
a traveler on vacation or on business and held against your will, it is very 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
She said that Menon's wife, Sumitra Menon, was able to speak by telephone with 
her husband that morning, shortly before phone lines were cut at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't know what was going on," Bufalini said. "They had no access 
to radio or television or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they could see the skies lighting up and obviously they were staying 
away from windows. They could hear bombs and see fires in the sky, and it was 
very frightening. He said he was in the airport lounge for about three hours 
and then was going to be transferred." 
</P>
<P>
No one has heard from him since that phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Bufalini added that she has since learned that people stopped at the airport 
were taken to three hotels. A check by the U.S. State Department with two of 
the hotels did not turn up Menon as a guest, she said, and U.S. officials were 
unable to get a cable message through to the third location, identified as the 
SAS Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Zena Dartnall, a Menon family friend in Los Angeles, said she recently spoke 
with Sumitra Menon and learned that family members are hoping he is safe inside 
the SAS Hotel and that he will be allowed to leave unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they're very worried and they're trying to contact him," she said. 
"They're trying to contact the embassies, the State Department here and 
everywhere else. They're trying to do their best, but they have had no contact 
(confirming) that he's in that hotel, either." 
</P>
<P>
Menon, 56, was born in India to a prominent family involved in that country's 
government. His father was India's secretary of finance, and his uncle, V. K. 
Krishna Menon, was foreign secretary and served as ambassador to China and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Menon served in various senior executive positions with EMI Music Worldwide 
from 1956 until his retirement from the company last month. In his current post 
with the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, he supervises a 
record-industry trade association with national groups and affiliates in 63 
countries.

<P>
It's a black thing. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Slogan often displayed by African-Americans 
</P>
<P>
Emily Feistritzer, a 49-year-old white Washingtonian, just can't make any sense 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
She is trying hard, struggling with the best of intentions to understand the 
incomprehensible: Why do so many black residents turn out at rallies and church 
meetings to cheer and praise Washington Mayor Marion Barry? Haven't they heard 
the news during the course of his crack-and-perjury trial -- that the man has 
been branded an adulterer by a string of admitted past lovers and videotaped 
deeply inhaling a pipe loaded with crack cocaine? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a baffling issue," she said. "Maybe we white folks like to think 
things out and be reasonable. But I look at what he did. I think Marion Barry 
has done real damage to blacks in this city, and the support he continues to 
get seems not to have much to do with the factual evidence of what he's been 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
In the best of times, black-white relations in Washington and, indeed, across 
the land, operate like the gears of a well-oiled machine, grinding against each 
other with a tolerable level of friction. 
</P>
<P>
But the Barry trial has exposed the tender differences and the frail 
coexistence between the races. The two groups watched the same trial, but came 
away from the spectacle with divergent interpretations. The answer to the 
differing perceptions lies partly in the history and partly in the present-day 
experiences of the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
As whites see it, race has nothing to do with it. They believe Barry has 
presided over a city in decline, setting a horrendous personal example for 
residents of a city faced with a growing drug and crime problem, official 
corruption and an inability to deliver basic services such as garbage pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Black Washingtonians, while withdrawing a measure of their political support 
for the mayor, viewed the Barry trial as yet another link in a long chain of 
black leaders systematically discredited by racist law enforcement officials. 
Stringing together a pattern of attacks upon their heroes, African-Americans 
across the nation stand in virtual unanimous agreement that white authorities 
and federal laws have conspired to cripple black leadership and hamper black 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, for example, recently told a group of black journalists 
that the pattern of legal and illegal attacks upon African-American leaders 
stretches back to slavery, including Reconstruction's Black Codes, the Jim Crow 
era laws, the legal battles of Marcus Garvey and Adam Clayton Powell, federal 
wiretaps and surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and FBI infiltration of 
the Black Panthers. These, he said, were examples of the zeal with which the 
government goes after black leaders. "It didn't begin with Marion Barry," 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Black leaders, like Barry, are able to tap into a "broad and deep strain of 
racial victimization" in American life, said Ronald Walters, chairman of Howard 
University's department of political science. "One of the reasons (Barry) gets 
this support," he said. "(Black) people identify with this and white people 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
"When Barry walks into a room of cheering black people, they are not 
necessarily saying we want you to be our next mayor of Washington, D.C.," 
Walters said. "They are saying that they understand his attackers and that he 
is a part of their community and that they will not lynch him. One cannot 
expect whites to buy into that community redemption because they are not a part 
of that community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In black Washington, the widely held opinion is that Barry had stood up to his 
white critics for as long as possible, and was only broken by determined and 
ruthless federal prosecutors hell-bent on using any means necessary to 
eliminate a powerful black leader. 
</P>
<P>
"When they finally wanted him, they got him," said one black woman, repeating a 
commonly shared assessment, "even if it meant getting a black woman to 
prostitute herself to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The effort to "get" Barry was misplaced, said Virginia Blandford, a Kansas 
native who has lived and raised two teen-age children in Washington over the 
past 20 years. "Black people are not so much supporting Barry as they are 
against the white establishment running roughshod over black officials," she 
added, sounding a popular theme. "You have other white officials doing similar 
things, but the effort is not being made to catch them. What I see, once again, 
is white people running their games. It all seems like a colossal waste of time 
and money." 
</P>
<P>
Barry is a lightning rod of racial attitudes, Walters said. "For blacks, Marion 
Barry is someone who came to Washington in the mid-'60s and immediately bonded 
with the street dudes," he said. "He worked with them and was known as someone 
who was doing something very positive with the young people at a time when many 
youths were in the streets and throwing Molotov cocktails." 
</P>
<P>
But blacks believed that whites viewed the dashiki-wearing activist as a 
dangerous black radical. "They were afraid of him," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks continue to find pride in Barry's ability to reshape his image enough 
with whites to work his way up the political system, Walters said. From street 
activist to school board member to city council to the mayor's office, Barry 
softened his fearsome tactics enough to win a share of their votes for 
electoral victories, but without losing touch with the brothers and sisters in 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not someone who went to Harvard Law School, got out and ran for mayor," 
Walters said. "When you look at his political evolution, you have to draw the 
conclusion that it represents the political evolution of black people for the 
last 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Lewis, a 43-year-old black woman, moved here six years ago to set up a 
real estate firm because Washington, unlike Boston where she had lived 
previously, had been transformed by Barry into a city where she "could see 
herself reflected in the city. One needs to see oneself reflected in a city 
where you pay taxes. You need to feel like you're a full participant in the 
life of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Barry -- who became mayor in 1978 and pushed for affirmative action in city 
hiring and contracting programs -- impressed both black native Washingtonians 
and newcomers, Lewis said. "He tossed out enough plums to the black community 
to have them perceive that he's done a great job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But whites have a totally different impression. They don't see themselves 
reflected in the city, often complaining in local newspapers about the 
mean-spirited and angry clerks at the city's vehicle registration office. 
Although the city's business community has benefited from city construction and 
contracts, their satisfaction has been tempered by the strutting arrogance and 
unveiled racial taunts that Barry has hurled at his critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what color he is," one white Washingtonian said as he made his 
way through a lunchtime crowd in a downtown cafeteria. "A mayor's first 
responsibility is to make sure the garbage is picked up and the potholes are 
filled. City services should come before posturing and posing." 
</P>
<P>
Further, they see little evidence of the purported government's enthusiasm for 
persecution of black officials. After all, many whites say, didn't federal 
prosecutors go after white officials in Watergate, Abscam and many other 
federal probes of malfeasance? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious issue for the future of all races," Feistritzer said. "Does 
the behavior of a visible person matter? In Marion Barry's case it doesn't seem 
to matter to some black people. 
</P>
<P>
"I say if there's someone doing something wrong," she said, flatly, "I would 
argue that we should be cleaning them all up. Regardless. Go after them all." 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the jury -- composed of 10 blacks and two whites -- to agree on 
12 of the 14 charges against the mayor makes a prophet of Barry, who has said 
all along that no jury in Washington would send him to jail. 
</P>
<P>
For Barry's supporters, who are drawn overwhelmingly from black communities 
across the city, it presents an opportunity to welcome back a battle-tested and 
surviving warrior. As one Washington woman put it, "He can always find his way 
back home in the black community."

President Bush, praising the personal efforts of Marilyn Quayle to promote 
early detection of cancer, signed legislation Friday to assist in providing 
breast and cervical cancer screening to mainly low-income women. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first public appearance for Vice President Dan Quayle's wife since 
she underwent a hysterectomy on July 28 after cancer cells were detected in a 
cervical Pap smear. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that Mrs. Quayle had brought "a wonderful, sincere element to this 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
The bill the President signed provides grants to states to screen women for 
breast and cervical cancer, using mammograms, Pap smears and physical 
examination.

RED CROSS TO OVERHAUL BLOOD SAFETY OVERSIGHTS; 
</P>

RECORD-KEEPING. FEDERAL WATCHDOGS HAD CRITICIZED THE AGENCY'S PROCEDURES.

The American Red Cross, whose blood-handling procedures are under scrutiny by 
Congress and the Food and Drug Administration, announced a series of changes 
Friday to ensure "the American people can count on a blood supply that is safe 
and meets our needs." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the restructuring will mean a significant change for the better for 
the entire Red Cross organization," said George F. Moody, chairman of the 
American Red Cross, which handles half of the nation's blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, speaking at a press conference, said the changes "will lead to greater 
standardization, better quality control, an even higher accountability to the 
American people and, ultimately, an even safer blood supply." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen H. Richards, executive vice president, acknowledged that the Red Cross 
had made mistakes in the past in its record-keeping and in its reporting and 
monitoring of mistakes and accidents involving blood supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that none of these shortcomings had resulted in blood 
contaminated with AIDS or hepatitis B "being transfused into a patient." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross said it will increase oversight of its 54 regional blood centers, 
where many of the problems occurred, by requiring them to report to officers 
paid and appointed by the national headquarters rather than to local Red Cross 
chapters. 
</P>
<P>
These officers will then report directly to the newly appointed senior vice 
president of blood services in Washington, Dr. Jeffrey McCullough, formerly 
director of Red Cross blood services in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the organization said it will substantially increase its staffing and 
financial resources to improve its monitoring procedures and computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the FDA released a report outlining numerous problems within the 
organization, including deficiencies in its computer systems and in its 
procedures for dealing with error and accident reports. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA criticized the Red Cross for failing to notify federal regulators of 
230 cases during the last 10 years in the Washington, D.C., area in which 
patients may have received AIDS-contaminated blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials have said that all but a "handful" of the cases occurred before 
1985, when a test was instituted to screen blood for AIDS infection. The Red 
Cross is now the target of a class-action suit on behalf of those 230 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, has charged that the Red Cross has "released infected blood, mixed 
up records, violated AIDS testing procedures and failed to deter infected or 
undesirable donors." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Nesbit, a spokesman for the FDA, said the agency "is encouraged by the 
restructuring," adding: "The Red Cross' plan to centralize the operations of 
its blood centers should help make sure they operate in a consistently safe and 
proper manner." 
</P>
<P>
Nesbit said the changes were "a significant move toward correcting the 
deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
Dingell called the action "overdue, but welcome," and said his committee "will 
continue to scrutinize all the components of the blood industry to make sure 
everything is being done to ensure that the blood supply is the safest and best 
that it can possibly be." 
</P>
<P>
Moody, who is a director and chairman of the executive committees of Security 
Pacific Corp. and Security Pacific National Bank, said the outside 
investigations had been surpassed "only by our own internal concern and searing 
self-examination." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that there had not yet been any erosion of public trust in 
the Red Cross. Nevertheless, he said, "these are serious issues" that made it 
necessary that "we act responsibly and earn the respect and confidence of the 
American public."

COURT ORDERS LAWYERS FOR CHILDREN IN MARROW TRANSPLANT CASE

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Friday ordered the appointment of guardians to 
represent three children involved in a bitter bone marrow transplant case, 
enabling the children to have a say in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The court's order sent the case back to Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds with 
orders to have attorneys present arguments on behalf of the 3-year-old twins 
and their dying, 12-year-old half brother. 
</P>
<P>
The order followed appeal of Reynolds' ruling that forcing twins James and 
Allison Curran to submit to blood tests would violate their right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Tamas Bosze, who fathered the twins while he was separated from his second wife 
in the 1980s, filed suit to compel the youngsters to take the tests to 
determine if they are a match for his son, Jean-Pierre, who is dying of 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother, Nancy Curran, has refused to allow the tests and has said a bone 
marrow transplant would endanger the children. 
</P>
<P>
The high court expressed concern that no one had represented the children 
during earlier court proceedings, which led to Friday's order. 
</P>
<P>
Bosze's attorney, Edward Jordan, has argued since the controversy began that a 
bone marrow transplant is Jean-Pierre's only hope. But doctors at Children's 
Hospital of Wisconsin announced on July 25 that the boy was too sick for a 
transplant to be successful at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Bosze wants a donor on hand in case his son goes into remission. 
Jean-Pierre has been undergoing intensive chemotherapy treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Bosze family, including a 1-year-old that Bosze fathered 
by an Atlanta woman, have been tested and found to be unsuitable donors. The 
National Bone Marrow Registry is looking for a donor. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan argued before the Supreme Court that Reynolds was wrong to put the blood 
test decision in the hands of the twins' mother, whose relationship with Bosze 
ended when she was eight months pregnant.

GRATEFUL DEAD MEMBER DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSE

A lethal mixture of morphine and cocaine commonly known as a "speedball" killed 
Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland, a coroner reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was "acute cocaine and narcotic intoxication," said the 
report released by Richard Rainey, Contra Costa County coroner. 
</P>
<P>
Mydland, 37, was found dead in his home in the east San Francisco suburb of 
Lafayette on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
The final autopsy report also noted that there was no sign of foul play and 
that no drugs or paraphernalia were found in Mydland's residence. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rainey said in a prepared statement, "the autopsy revealed a recent 
puncture mark on the left arm consistent with recent intravenous injection 
prior to death." A toxicology examination of the body disclosed "a lethal level 
of morphine and cocaine," a mixture "commonly referred to as a 'speedball,' " 
Rainey said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mydland, a Northern California native, had been playing keyboards for the 
Grateful Dead since 1979. He was the Dead's third keyboardist to die since the 
popular rock group was formed in 1965. Founding member Ron (Pigpen) McKernan 
died of liver disease in 1973, and Keith Godchaux died in a car crash in 1980, 
one year after leaving the band. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Mydland had played an increasingly larger role in the band, 
writing and performing as lead singer for three songs on the group's latest 
album, "Built to Last." 
</P>
<P>
Mydland is survived by his wife, Lisa, and his daughters, Jessica and Jennifer.

REGIONS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR TRAVELING SMOG; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: DOWNWIND AREAS WON'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR POLLUTION THEY 
INHERIT, STATE PANEL DECIDES.

To find a more equitable way to measure whose smog is whose, the state Air 
Resources Board approved a policy resolution Friday that will hold regions 
accountable for the air pollution they generate, even after the smog has 
traveled miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning immediately, the state will no longer hold downwind areas, such as 
San Diego and the San Joaquin Valley, responsible for the smog they inherit 
from upwind neighbors such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the resolution urges air quality districts that significantly harm 
their neighbors' air quality to develop strategies to reduce transport smog. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the state board, said the state's 41 air quality 
districts will now consider the board's resolution and begin developing 
strategies. Friday's action reaffirms a portion of the California Clean Air Act 
that requires regions to take their neighbors into consideration when 
implementing smog-reducing regulations. In the act, regional districts are 
asked to be good neighbors and impose extra controls, if necessary, to keep 
their pollution out of someone else's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Goggin, a spokesman for the San Diego County Air Pollution Control 
District, called the policy "significant" because it will clarify "who is 
responsible for what." By the district's own measure, 41 of the 55 days that 
San Diego County exceeded federal air quality standards in 1989 were caused by 
smog from Los Angeles. Of the 158 days that San Diego exceeded state standards, 
Goggin estimated 62 could be blamed on Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, smoggy San Diego days judged to be caused by Los Angeles smog 
would not be counted as days that San Diego exceeded air quality standards. The 
result would put less pressure on San Diego County to impose stricter 
smog-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pollution on those days would be racked up to Los Angeles, it also 
is unlikely that the new policy would mean stricter standards in that area, 
Goggin said. Los Angeles already has the strictest air quality plan in the 
nation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're already doing what they can. They're not going to make their plan any 
tougher," Goggin said. "The policy just recognizes that they have the 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which specifies 14 sites around the state where 
boundary-crossing smog has been identified as a significant source of air 
pollution, likely will have a greater impact on areas that have not yet 
completed their air quality plans or areas where transport smog is responsible 
for the vast majority of smoggy days. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said San Luis Obispo County, for example, which never violates federal 
standards and only rarely exceeds stricter state limits, could benefit greatly 
if its neighbors adopted stricter control measures. 
</P>
<P>
The problem goes far beyond San Diego. San Bernardino, Riverside and Palm 
Springs have all inherited pollution generated in Los Angeles County. Los 
Angeles smog has been measured by scientists at Death Valley and the Grand 
Canyon. One study spotted California smog as far away as Colorado.

MAGELLAN FAST FACTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some unusual facts about the Magellan spacecraft and Venus, culled 
from "The Magellan Venus Explorer's Guide" and other NASA publications: 
</P>
<P>
Getting Magellan to Venus required three main engines and two rockets on the 
shuttle that carried it into Earth orbit, two rockets on the inertial 
upper-stage booster that hurled it toward Venus, and one braking rocket to slow 
it down for entry into orbit around Venus. But for 99% of Magellan's 
948-million-mile trip to Venus, it cruised without power. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures and pressures on Venus are equivalent to conditions inside a 
900-degree Fahrenheit self-cleaning oven 3,000 feet below the surface of an 
ocean on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
If Magellan flew over Earth's Mt. St. Helens volcano, it could recognize it as 
a mountain. The radar on Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which were 
launched in 1983, wouldn't be able to distinguish Mount St. Helens from a 
meteorite impact crater. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union named two craters on Venus after teacher Christa McAuliffe and 
astronaut Judith Resnick, who were among seven crew members killed during the 
1986 explosion of the U.S. shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan's namesake, 16th-Century explorer Ferdinand Magellan, was killed in 
1521 when he got involved in a dispute between warring tribes in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
During each orbit around Venus, Magellan will travel about 38,314 miles at an 
average speed of 12,163 m.p.h.

3 MEN CONVICTED IN $5-MILLION TELEMARKETING SCAM 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were convicted Friday of fraud and tax offenses for their 
participation in a $5-million telemarketing scam in which hundreds of customers 
were sold phony rights to precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury in Los Angeles convicted Matthew Lothian, 28, of Newport Beach; 
Lester Charles Thompson, 45, and Mark Stephen Ott, 24, of Sunrise, Fla., for 
their roles in an Orange County telemarketing scam in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants were convicted of mail and wire fraud, interstate transportation 
of property obtained by fraud and tax evasion charges. They each face maximum 
prison terms of more than 100 years and fines of up to $5.25 million when 
sentenced Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Two other defendants, Merlin Blaine Riley, 28, of Mission Viejo, and Gary James 
Kummer, 30, of Laguna Hills, were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-week trial, Assistant U.S. Atty. David Sklansky presented 
evidence showing that the defendants, working through the B.N. Goldberg &amp; 
Associates and M.S. Sawyer &amp; Co. telemarketing firms, defrauded customers 
by falsely promising that their money would be used to purchase precious metals 
or the rights to future delivery of the metals. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the money was used to pay "sales commissions, overhead, personal 
expenses and (for) paying back earlier investors," Sklansky said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the victims' individual losses ranged from $1,000 to $150,000.

ANDERSON POWERS ANGELS IN 10TH, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Kent Anderson half expected to be pinch-hit for, with the bases loaded and one 
out in the 10th inning Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
He watched the signs from third base carefully, knowing the squeeze might be 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader let him swing, and Anderson delivered a line-drive single to 
right-center field that gave the Angels a 2-1 victory over the Baltimore 
Orioles before 42,195 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time I get pinch-hit for," said Anderson, who was batting .283 
with only four runs batted in. "Tonight it didn't happen. It worked out." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels loaded the bases with none out in the 10th inning on three 
consecutive walks. Stopper Gregg Olson issued back-to-back walks to Chili Davis 
and Lee Stevens before going to a 3-and-0 count against Johnny Ray, 
pinch-hitting for Lance Parrish and looking to bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Schilling relieved Olson, and completed the walk to Ray, loading the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Brian Downing lifted a towering drive to left that barely hooked 
foul before popping out foul for the first out. That brought up Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Rader stuck with him, even with Dave Winfield on the bench, sitting out because 
of tightness in his hamstrings. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing about Kent Anderson, he's not a guy who would be awed by that 
situation. He's got moxie," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Fraser (4-3), who pitched four innings of relief, giving up two hits and 
retiring the final nine in a row, earned his second victory in three nights. 
</P>
<P>
Olson (5-4) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
The victory prevented the Angels from falling into last, although it couldn't 
keep them out of sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had a chance to win in the ninth, with runners on first and third 
and one out. But shortstop Cal Ripken fielded Max Venable's grounder and threw 
out Dick Schofield at home for the second out, and Devon White grounded out to 
first for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 1-0 lead on a third-inning home run by Venable, a player who 
spent the 1988 season out of professional baseball after being cut in spring 
training by the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Since being cut by the Orioles, Venable had gone eight for 25 against them with 
one home run when he stepped in against Pete Harnisch with no one on in the 
third inning. His homer to right-center field was his fourth of the season, and 
his second against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles would show their respect to Venable later -- and slight White -- 
when they twice chose to walk Venable intentionally to get to White with 
runners on base and two out. 
</P>
<P>
It worked both times, White popping to short once and striking out the second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, the Angel starter, gave up one run on only four hits before 
being removed after six innings because of tightness in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven was starting for the first time since July 30. He missed a scheduled 
start last Saturday after an auto accident last week involving his wife, 
Patricia, and three of the couple's four children. None were seriously injured, 
although his son Tommy suffered two broken arms. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had a chance to pad their 1-0 lead in the fifth inning, but wasted 
it, leaving the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill led off with a standup double to right. Anderson drew a full-count 
walk, and Schofield sacrificed, very nearly safe himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles got the second out when Luis Polonia grounded out to second, 
bringing up Venable. 
</P>
<P>
They walked him intentionally, loading the bases for White, who popped to 
short, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who entered the game with a 5.41 earned-run average, the highest on 
the Angel staff, gave up a single to the first batter of the game, Dave 
Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not allow another hit until Rene Gonzales singled in the third 
inning, and the third hit did not come until there were two out in the sixth 
inning, when Steve Finley lined a double deep into right field. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven's slim cushion disappeared quickly. Ripken stepped to the plate and 
drove in Finley with a single to left, tying the score. Sam Horn then flied to 
left, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner, on the disabled list since July 12 because of a broken right knee 
cap, might not return until after the September roster expansion. The typical 
healing period for such an injury is six to eight weeks, trainer Ned Bergert 
said. That would project to a return between Aug. 23 and Sept. 6, without 
allowing for reconditioning. . . . Dave Winfield's tightness in his hamstrings 
was probably the result of running on a soft infield recently, he said. Brian 
Downing, who suffered a slightly strained his right hamstring Wednesday, was 
out of the lineup for a second consecutive day.. . . The activation of 
left-handed reliever Bob McClure remains imminent. "I try to look at it this 
way," said McClure, who has not pitched all season because of elbow problems. 
"It's been four months anyway. What's another day or two?"

GRADY SHOOTS CONSERVATIVE 67; 
</P>
<P>
PGA: HE LEADS TOURNAMENT WITH 139 BY STAYING OUT OF SHOAL CREEK'S INFAMOUS 
ROUGH.

<P>
The whining subsided Friday, but the struggles did not as the 1990 PGA 
Championship continued to inflict its special brand of torment on a numb, weary 
field. 
</P>
<P>
But Australian Wayne Grady managed to solve Shoal Creek's quirky ways and for 
his efforts was rewarded with a 67, five shots under par and one ahead of the 
field as the second round came to a merciful end. 
</P>
<P>
Grady began the day at par, but quickly shot up the leader board with four 
birdies on the front nine and another two on the back side. His two-day total 
of 139 put him a stroke better than Fred Couples, who played a patient, 
conservative round of 71; and Larry Mize, who shot a 68, thanks to three 
birdies on the last four holes. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Mayfair, 24, and Chip Beck were at 141, and four players, among them 
defending champion Payne Stewart and Fuzzy Zoeller, were four strokes off the 
lead at 143. 
</P>
<P>
That ended the roll call of sub-par two-day totals. Shoal Creek, with its 
oft-criticized rough and, so the pros say, inconsistent greens, wasn't in a 
giving mood Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Grady had his impressive 67 by staying clear of the rough. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't hit it in there enough to be really cheesed off," he said. "If I hit 
it in there 15 times (today), I'll probably come in this (interview room) and 
tear it up." 
</P>
<P>
Zoeller, who recorded a 71 Friday, simply called Shoal Creek "the hardest damn 
course I've ever played in my life in a tournament." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a complaint as much as a statement of fact. 
</P>
<P>
For evidence, simply consult the score cards of Seve Ballesteros, 83; Mike Reid 
and Robert Gamez, 78; Mark Calcavecchia, 77, and Curtis Strange, 76. 
</P>
<P>
Gamez and Reid made the cut at 151 but Ballesteros, Calcavecchia and Strange 
caught rides to the Birmingham airport. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in as many years that Grady has flirted with greatness. 
He led the 1989 British Open at Troon after two rounds but later squandered the 
advantage and ultimately lost to Calcavecchia in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think about it, but I don't anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, none of the four majors has been particularly kind to Grady. He 
missed the cut at both this year's British Open and U.S. Open and tied for 27th 
at the Masters. Of course, you wouldn't have known it Friday when Grady 
recorded only one bogey during the round. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of my better rounds, because of the conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grady was referring not only to the rough but to the sometimes-hard, 
sometimes-soft greens as well. But all in all, Grady considered the course "an 
excellent layout." 
</P>
<P>
He will get little argument from Couples or Mize. Couples called Shoal Creek "a 
great, great course," and Mize said, "I like it this way." 
</P>
<P>
Couples retired his driver for most of the day, relying instead on placement 
and patience, not exactly his hallmarks. In short, "Boom Boom," as Couples is 
called on the tour, turned to dink-dink golf. Known for ballistic drives, 
Couples decided to treat the course with care and respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out there having a picnic," he said. "But my attitude is if I hit in 
(the rough), which I'm going to do, then don't worry about it. I know a lot of 
people don't care for the rough, but it's not going anywhere. There's nothing 
you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
It is for that reason that Couples said the scores will continue to be on the 
high side. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there will be a lot of scores in the 60s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart remains within striking distance of the lead, and for the first time 
this week, he didn't go out of his way to rip the rough. However, he did take 
about a two-foot chunk of Bermuda grass out of the ground after 
"malfunctioning" an easy sand wedge shot on No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter would have said, 'Daddy, that wasn't very nice,' " Stewart said. 
"But I did replace (the huge divot)." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart played better after the temper tantrum. In fact, he said he liked his 
chances to repeat as PGA champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Good scores can be played here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grady proved that much. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four players made the 151 cut. Jack Nicklaus at 152, Arnold Palmer at 
162 and Lee Trevino at 152 did not. Trevino won the PGA at Shoal Creek in 1984. 
. . . Mark Lye and Jay Don Blake both withdrew after 10 holes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Wadkins, who began the day four under par and holding a one-shot lead, 
shot a 75. His day included a woman yelling as he stroked a putt and a driver 
snapping in two during his backswing. Wadkins said he will either borrow a 
driver from his brother, Lanny, or have a new club sent by air express. . . . 
Fuzzy Zoeller on why the course is playing so hard: "I think what we're paying 
for is Lee Trevino shooting a damn great score here in '84." Trevino finished 
the tournament that year at 15 under.

COOPER NEAR END AS LAKER?; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: CLUB PLANS TO WAIVE HIM AND, IF OTHER TEAMS PASS, HE WILL BE 
FREE TO PLAY IN ITALY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Cooper's 12-year career with the Lakers will be over in a week, if all 
goes according to plan. 
</P>
<P>
The team is planning to put Cooper on waivers Wednesday, and any NBA club would 
then have 48 hours to claim him at his salary of a little more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Should all pass, Cooper would be free to accept a three-year, $5-million offer 
from Il Messaggero Roma of the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, 34, has reportedly sent word to every NBA club that he wants to go to 
Europe and would not look favorably on being claimed. The exception would be a 
contending club, especially one willing to extend and enhance his contract, 
which expires after the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Cooper was told by both Laker owner Jerry Buss and 
General Manager Jerry West that he was welcome to remain with the team but 
would not receive a contract extension or additional money. He was also told it 
would be fine with the Lakers if he looked elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Buss nor West could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball is pretty much in Michael's court," Laker assistant general manager 
Mitch Kupchak said. "He has to decide which way he wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
Had the Lakers put Cooper on waivers earlier, other clubs would have had 10 
days to claim him. Starting Wednesday, the period is cut to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Facing an uncertain future here, Cooper contemplated "retiring" to get out of 
his contract, then resurfacing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
But the league office wouldn't buy that. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because a player says he is retiring doesn't make his contract 
evaporate," said Gary Bettman, the league's general counsel. "If the Lakers 
don't wish to have him on their roster, he must be offered to other teams 
before his contract is terminated." 
</P>
<P>
If Cooper had tried to circumvent the system, FIBA, the international governing 
body of the sport, would not have allowed him to play in Italy. And even if he 
had been permitted to jump, the NBA could have gone to court to stop him from 
breaking his contract.

MORNING BRIEFING: SOVIET RETURNS WITH SOMETHING FAR MORE VALUABLE THAN GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last person out of Seattle must have remembered to turn out the lights, 
because it's been tough to find the sentimental afterglow of the Goodwill 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
But Catherine Foster of the Christian Science Monitor may have found the Games' 
emblematic figure. He's Victor Gruzdev, an economist for the Soviet Sports 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
During his two weeks in Seattle, Gruzdev stayed with four families. One of his 
hosts, John Butcher, said: "I heard that it cost (Gruzdev) three months' salary 
to come over, and I wanted to make sure he had some nice things to take back." 
</P>
<P>
Butcher said that when he took Gruzdev with him to work at Washington Natural 
Gas Co., the Soviet visitor was "mobbed." Employees took up a collection for 
their new friend and raised $127. 
</P>
<P>
Add Goodwill: Gruzdev boarded the plane home with a boom box, a telephone, 
plastic storage bags and a Bart Simpson bumper sticker that reads: "Get outta 
my way, man!" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which seven NFL teams do not play home games in the cities for 
which they are named? 
</P>
<P>
Crowd-pleaser: Tickets for a recent game between the Chicago White Sox and the 
Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park were going at a premium. "Everybody has a theory 
about the skyrocketing demand," wrote Michael Grunwald in the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Said one scalper: "You know what it is? People want to see Don Zimmer." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer, who manages the Chicago Cubs, last managed Boston in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Loose translation: The day before he entered the hospital because of chest 
pains, Denver Coach Dan Reeves offered advice to the Indianapolis Colts' rookie 
quarterback, Jeff George, who will make his pro debut against the Broncos 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves recommended that George not rush himself -- the opposite of the way 
Reeves handled Bronco quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves told reporters in a telephonic news conference: "John did extremely well 
in the (exhibition) season, and I assumed that he was ready. . . . It was like 
taking Spanish, and you can speak Spanish but you go to Mexico and you have a 
tough time." 
</P>
<P>
Hum a few bars: When Texas Ranger pitcher Bobby Witt was 3-8, he went to 
teammate Charlie Hough for advice. Since then, Witt has gone 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hough: "I wish I could remember everything I told him." 
</P>
<P>
Team of the '90s: Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., won't put its 
new NCAA Division III football team on the field until 1991. But when it does, 
opponents will be dealing with a media phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-student Catholic school is recruiting with a series of NCAA-approved 
advertisements. The print ads ask: "Think you can fill this helmet?" 
</P>
<P>
So far, Coach Gary Reho told the Associated Press, 50 prospective players think 
they can. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, Sacred Heart's nickname is the Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Add Sacred Heart: When asked whether the ad campaign would continue, Reho said: 
"That remains to be seen. If it becomes too effective, I'm sure somebody will 
come up with some rule saying you can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Comedy City: Wallace Matthews of Newsday, noting that Sugar Ray Leonard's next 
bout might be held in the Soviet Union, wondered where. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rich Rose of Caesars World: "In Leonardgrad, where else?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Bills, Cardinals, Cowboys, Giants, Jets, Lions and Rams.

The Canadian government will allow Ben Johnson to return to competition, but 
according to the Canadian Olympic Assn., his eligibility to join teams 
sanctioned by the COA has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which has jurisdiction over Canadian participation in the 
Olympic Games and the Pan American Games, said it reserves the right to extend 
any suspension imposed by national or international federations. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Sport Minister Marcel Danis announced Thursday that while the 
government's lifetime ban on funding to the Toronto sprinter would remain in 
effect, any decision on competitive sanctions would rest with the sport's 
national governing body, Athletics Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's two-year suspension from international competition ends Sept. 24, and 
Athletics Canada says he will be welcomed back, provided he meets qualifying 
standards.

TENNIS SAN DIEGO TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
GRAF WASTES NO TIME WHILE DEFEATING TAUZIAT

Fans have become so accustomed to watching Steffi Graf beat opponents quickly, 
it is no longer a game of inches. Instead, it is a game of minutes and seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's 6-3, 6-2 victory over France's Nathalie Tauziat Friday in the 
quarterfinals of the $225,000 Great American Bank Tennis Tournament took only 
54 minutes. But it seemed, by standards the world's No. 1 women's player has 
unintentionally set, to last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
In Graf's first two matches here, she defeated Stephanie Rehe in 54 minutes and 
Kathy Rinaldi in 76. While no official records are kept, her 33-minute victory 
over Kim Kessaris in Mahwah, N.J., in 1988, is thought to be a record. 
</P>
<P>
But all week, players have been saying that Graf, whose three-year anniversary 
as the world's No. 1 player is Aug. 16, isn't as dominant as she once was. They 
say she's vulnerable, that since she has been beaten this year, other players 
are catching on. 
</P>
<P>
One who has discovered this is third-seeded Zina Garrison, who beat Graf, 6-3, 
3-6, 6-4, this year in the semifinals at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison played almost perfect tennis against Terry Phelps in the evening 
match, winning, 6-0, 6-3, before 3,814 and setting up a semifinal showdown 
against Graf today on center court at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Martina Navratilova injured her calf and withdrew from the 
tournament earlier in the week, leaving the remaining top-seeded players to 
meet before the final. Fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria will meet 
Barbara Paulus in the other semifinal tonight at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Graf holds a 5-2 edge over Garrison in head-to-head competition, 
but Garrison won their last meeting at Wimbledon. Last year, in the final of 
this tournament, Garrison lost to Graf, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be anything special because I lost the last time," Graf 
said. "I'm going to try hard. It's not going to be easy, because she has the 
type of game that doesn't let me get into a rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Said Garrison, when asked if Graf would be looking to avenge her Wimbledon 
loss: "I don't know about revenge. It was really tough when I played her last 
year. She knows I'm out there, she knows what I'm about, she knows I'm going to 
be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Against Tauziat, Graf said she settled down more in the second set and played 
better than in the first, when she let Tauziat break her serve and then hold to 
close the score to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall it was a good match," Graf said, "especially in the second set. I 
think I was playing sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Graf used a new racket and tried a new topspin backhand she has been 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the racket) was very tight," she said. "I tried not to go for every shot, 
to be a little more patient. I told myself to be a little more cautious, a 
little more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Graf hit one topspin backhand, and it sailed far over the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"So I didn't try it for a while," she said. "I tried it again, but it's not yet 
the backhand I want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Tauziat said her level of play wasn't so far behind Graf's, that she made too 
many mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between her and me is not so much talent," she said. "It's 
close. The difference, it's more in my mistakes."

Stefan Edberg defeated Michael Chang on Friday -- and with the victory earned

$1.3-million ATP championship at Mason, Ohio. The victory also moved Edberg 
past Ivan Lendl for the top spot in the ATP computer rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone is going to be No. 1 in the rankings," Edberg, 24, said. "You 
need to play good tennis. I've done that this year. (Being No.1) is something 
that I've wanted to do. The last couple of years I thought I had a chance. Now 
I've done it." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the Wimbledon champion, passed Lendl to become the eighth No. 1 since 
the computer ratings began in 1973. Lendl, who didn't play in the tournament, 
has been No. 1 for most of the last seven years, except for a brief period when 
another Swede, Mats Wilander, was on top. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said that he was aware that he could take over the top spot this week. 
He also said that he was aware of what came with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is still going to go on," he said. "I will try to stay up there as long 
as I can. My main goal now is to play well at the (U.S.) Open." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said he would celebrate by taking a four-day vacation next week. His 
only commitment before the U.S. Open, Aug. 27-Sept. 9 at Flushing Meadow, N.Y., 
is an exhibition the week before the final Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
His quarterfinal victory over the Chang wasn't easy, though. Chang had to fight 
to hold serve to start the third set, then built a 3-1 lead before Edberg won 
the next four games to take command. 
</P>
<P>
In today's semifinals, Edberg will meet Andres Gomez, who is ranked fifth in 
the world. Gomez defeated Jim Courier, 6-1, 6-4, in another quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Brad Gilbert held off Jakob Hlasek, 2-6, 6-1, 7-5, to earn a 
spot in the semifinals against Scott Davis. The unseeded Davis held off 
15th-seeded Richard Fromberg, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10-8). 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Susan Sloane upset fourth-seeded Dinky Van Rensburg of South 
Africa, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, to move into the semifinals of a $150,000 women's 
tournament at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Sloane will be joined by second-seeded Laura Gildemeister of Peru, who 
rebounded from an 0-6 loss in the first set to beat Anne Minter of Australia, 
0-6, 6-3, 6-2. Third-seeded Anne Smith beat South Africa's Amanda Coetzer, 6-2, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Raleigh Edge advanced to the championship match of Team-Tennis with a 27-16 
victory over the Miami Beach Breakers in the Eastern Division finals at 
Raleigh, N.C. Raleigh will play the Los Angeles Strings for the title Sunday 
night at the Forum.

O'NEILL, CHARLTON RIGHT THE REDS AGAINST GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants are the one-two teams in the 
National League West. They are also two teams in need of a spark. 
</P>
<P>
Paul O'Neill and Norm Charlton provided the lift for the Reds Friday night as 
they beat the Giants, 7-0, in the opener of a four-game series at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill hit two home runs off Don Robinson, and Charlton pitched a three-hitter 
for his first shutout and first complete game. The victory gave the Reds a 5 
1/2-game lead over the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who hit a two-run home run in the first inning, led off the third with 
another to give him five home runs off Robinson this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the fifth victory in 18 games for the Reds and the sixth loss for 
the Giants in their last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody sensed the importance of this series, even though there will be 49 
games after it's over," Red Manager Lou Piniella said. "It isn't going to 
decided the pennant, but we needed to win the first one. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul gave us a start and Norm was absolutely terrific. We needed a spark, 
especially after they beat us four times in San Francisco. Ever since then, 
we've been pressing. Maybe now we will be more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
"We let them know we're in first place and we plan on being here all season," 
Charlton (9-6) said. "I don't think there's a guy on this team who plans on 
relinquishing that lead. We've had the lead since April 9 and we don't plan on 
giving it up." 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, O'Neill was .188 lifetime against Robinson. He's six for 14 
this year and all but one of the hits was a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked what I threw, didn't he?" Robinson said. "I don't think I could lob 
it up there and give up five home runs. Jack Clark used to be toughest. Now, it 
must be Paul O'Neill." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson (8-3) has given up 18 runs in the first inning this season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 8, Pittsburgh 3 -- Their most successful pitcher had to leave after 
two innings because of a stiff shoulder at Pittsburgh, but the Cardinals still 
knocked the Pirates out of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
After striking out four of the six batters he faced, John Tudor (11-3) 
departed, holding his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee, Todd Zeile and Jose Oquendo each had three hits for the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman, returning after being out a week with a hamstring problem, had 
four hits, including a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dayley (3-2) pitched 3 1/3 perfect innings to get the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds hit a two-run homer for the Pirates, who dropped half a game behind 
New York after losing their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Chicago 1 -- The Mets moved into first place on the three-hit 
pitching of Sid Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets ended Greg Maddux's five-game winning streak, although their three 
runs in the second inning were unearned because of a two-out error by first 
baseman Mark Grace. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds suffered back spasms as a result of Thursday night's brawl 
with Philadelphia and did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, hit hard in his two previous starts, had a string of 20 outs until 
Luis Salazar spoiled his shutout with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd (7-4) gave up four hits in 
six innings at Montreal, but the Expos' bullpen barely made his 4-1 lead hold 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Daulton hit a two-run home run in the ninth inning to make it close. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines singled twice and scored both times for the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 2, Houston 0 -- The Padres were 21-31 while Benito Santiago, their 
heavy-hitting catcher was on the disabled list. He celebrated his return at 
Houston by driving in the first run with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson (9-7) gave up seven hits and came within two outs of getting the 
shutout. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
STEWART DEFEATS YANKEES FOR HIS 16TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Dave Stewart went into a slump at the end of May that lasted for exactly a 
month, it didn't seem possible the Oakland right-hander would have his fourth 
consecutive 20-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
He lost five of his six starts, and on June 28 had a 9-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
With August one-third complete, Stewart (16-8) is on the road to that 20th 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his best performances, Stewart held the New York Yankees to three 
hits in 8 2/3 innings Friday night at Oakland as the A's won, 3-0. Rick 
Honeycutt got the final out after Stewart, who retired 22 batters in a row, 
faltered. He struck out Mel Hall for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
It was Stewart's fifth victory in a row. He figures to get eight or nine more 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart extended to 31 innings his string without giving up an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6-9, Milwaukee 5-4 -- George Brett went seven for 10 at Kansas City 
to lead the doubleheader sweep and move the Royals into fifth place in the 
American League West. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener Brett was four for five, and his double with two on in the eighth 
inning drove in the tying and winning runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game Brett had three more hits, driving in a run and scoring 
another. His seven hits tied his club record for a doubleheader. Brett, who had 
three hits Thursday night, is 10 for 14 with eight RBIs in the last three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"It is somewhat similar to 1980," Brett said between games, referring to the 
season in which he hit .390. "When I come up to the plate I have the feeling I 
can hit any pitch that the pitcher throws." 
</P>
<P>
Since the All-Star game, he's been doing just that. In 29 games, he is 51 for 
121 (.421). Eighteen of those hits have been doubles. In his last 38 games, he 
has driven in 39 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Toronto 3 -- The Blue Jays keep blowing chances to close the gap 
on the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
They built a 3-1 lead at Toronto before the Twins, last in the West, scored six 
runs in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Mack, whose baserunning blunder in the second ruined a potential big 
inning, hit a two-run homer to tie it. After Kirby Puckett singled in the 
tiebreaking run, Gary Gaetti clinched it with a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, who trail Boston by two games, are 4-7 in their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5-5, Texas 2-1 -- Nolan Ryan said he didn't want to end his career with 
300 victories, but the next one is proving tough to get. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan gave up back-to-back home runs to rookie Craig Grebeck of Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and Ozzie Guillen in the second inning of the nightcap at 
Chicago and lost his second in a row to drop to 11-6. 
</P>
<P>
In 423 at-bats between them this season, Grebeck and Guillen had not hit a home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan went five innings, giving up five runs and six hits. He struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Edwards, making his first major league start after 39 relief appearances, 
won the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep enabled the White Sox to move to within 3 1/2 games of the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Jack McDowell (8-6) gave up just one run in seven innings and 
Dan Pasqua drove in three runs with a home run and a single. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Detroit 2 -- After losing three games, Mike Walker won at 
Cleveland when Mitch Webster hit a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
Walker gave up seven hits in 8 1/3 innings for his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Steve Searcy (1-4) lasted only 3 2/3 innings for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Boston 1 -- Ken Griffey Jr. had four hits and Randy Johnson pitched 
a four-hitter over eight-plus innings to break his four-game losing streak in 
beating the Red Sox in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners ended a three-game skid when Griffey tripled and singled three 
times off Dana Kiecker (4-5), raising his batting average five points to .323.

GM TO LAY OFF 4,200 DUE TO MIDEAST STRIFE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE AUTO MAKER'S YPSILANTI, MICH., PLANT WILL BE CLOSED FOR ONLY TWO 
WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors will temporarily close its Ypsilanti, Mich., plant Monday and 
lay off the facility's 4,200 workers because Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has 
prompted many customers in the Middle East to cancel orders of GM vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and neighboring countries have been one of largest overseas markets for 
North American-made GM cars and trucks. Luxury cars such as Cadillacs and large 
sedans at the more expensive end of the mid-priced GM lines have been 
particularly popular in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular GM sedans in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- the Chevrolet 
Caprice -- has been produced at the Ypsilanti plant since last December. Buick 
station wagons are also built there. 
</P>
<P>
The Caprice is "a full-size car that the Saudis and Kuwaitis have preferred for 
many years," John Pekarek, a GM spokesman, said. "It handles well; it's heavy 
and it has a luxury feel. It's considered a good value . . . at a cost of 
$18,000 to $20,000." 
</P>
<P>
Pekarek said GM sold 40,000 vehicles in the Middle East last year -- 10,000 of 
them at its two dealerships in Kuwait. Before the Iraqi invasion, he added, GM 
had expected the sales volume for the region to remain steady or rise. 
</P>
<P>
GM announced Friday that it had decided to close the Ypsilanti plant for two 
weeks and lay off its workers after the regional sales office in the Middle 
East -- located in the United Arab Emirates -- canceled orders equal to about 
two weeks of production at Ypsilanti, Pekarek said. GM sources said the plant 
had been scheduled to produce about 12,000 vehicles during the two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
The regional sales office accepts purchase orders from a dozen dealerships in 
the Middle East -- including two in Kuwait -- and relays them to Detroit, 
Pekarek said. The sales office canceled the orders because the Iraqi invasion 
prompted consumers throughout the region to cancel or delay major purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can get vehicles to Kuwait," Pekarek said. "Dealerships in 
the other countries are still open, but sale orders are taking a hit." 
</P>
<P>
To meet pre-invasion demand in the region, GM had planned to build an assembly 
plant in Iraq and had signed an agreement with the Iraqi government last May. 
However, the company suspended plans to build the plant after Iraq moved into 
Kuwait, Pekarek said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has not allowed four GM employees -- one American, two 
Canadians and a Briton -- assigned to oversee construction of the plant to 
leave Baghdad, Pekarek said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, several other GM assembly plants were forced to close Friday 
because of a 3-day-old walkout by about 3,200 workers at a GM parts plant in 
Flint, Mich. The striking workers produce fuel tanks, engine valves, doors and 
grills. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Tom Pyden said pickup truck plants in Pontiac, Mich., and 
Shreveport, La., were closed because of a resulting parts shortage, idling a 
total 4,400 workers and raising the total of those laid off because of parts 
shortages to nearly 8,000. Other plants where workers have been idled are in 
Flint and Moraine, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
GM is expected to close several more assembly operations by Monday if it is 
unable to resolve disputes with the United Auto Workers union and its Local 659 
over health, safety and subcontracting issues at the Flint plant.

CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
FEW AMERICANS ARE HEEDING BUSH'S PLEA TO CONSERVE ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald W. Majer considers himself environmentally conscious and worries that 
the mounting tensions in the Middle East could lead to another oil shortage. 
But don't ask him to part with his navy blue Cadillac Fleetwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to run out and get a Toyota tomorrow," said Majer, an insurance 
office manager from West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"People," he added, "have to get kicked on the side of the head before they 
make any changes." 
</P>
<P>
That, more or less, appears to be the posture that most consumers are taking on 
saving energy in the face of the Persian Gulf crisis. President Bush has called 
on the American public to conserve to offset the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, 
but so far not many people appear to be answering. 
</P>
<P>
Buses are no more crowded than usual. Homeowners don't seem to be lining up to 
buy insulation materials or clotheslines. Most vacationers are going ahead with 
their travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
Only a sustained crisis, economists and consumers agree, will prompt people to 
change their ways with energy. Said Barry Wishengrad, general sales manager of 
West Valley Toyota in nearby Canoga Park: "I've yet to have someone come in and 
say, 'Give me a good, fuel-efficient car.' " 
</P>
<P>
Motorists got some comforting news Friday when the American Automobile Assn. 
reported that the average price nationally for self-service, unleaded fuel 
dipped by 0.3 cents to $1.25 per gallon -- the first daily decline since Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The AAA survey came after several oil companies 
decided earlier in the week to follow Atlantic Richfield's lead and either 
temporarily freeze, or roll back, prices. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the past week's increases, gasoline prices are about 40% lower than 
they were a decade ago after inflation is taken into account, said Carl 
Steidtmann, chief economist for the Ohio consulting firm Management Horizons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, economists warn that consumers will have no choice but to alter their 
spending habits if oil prices start rising rapidly again because of hostilities 
in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline and other fuels are necessities, noted Sandra Shaber, an analyst with 
the Futures Group in Washington. When energy costs go up, "it really makes a 
difference in what's available for other types of spending." 
</P>
<P>
Shaber predicted that if the Mideast crisis persists, consumers will respond by 
canceling or curtailing their trips and buying smaller cars and other 
energy-saving products. So far, travel agents say, the main change is that 
people are hurrying to book flights to beat coming fare increases related to 
higher fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Even consumers who resist changing their energy-using habits may soon alter 
other types of personal spending plans. Consumer confidence surveys show that 
people are increasingly worried about a recession, and the Persian Gulf crisis 
is yet another warning sign, said consumer psychologist Richard Feinberg of 
Purdue University. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding that consumers are talking about delaying spending for the 
things they want but don't really need," Feinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a sprinkling of consumers appear to be at least investigating ways of 
cutting their spending on gasoline. At Commuter Computer, a Los Angeles 
organization that arranges car-pooling and van-pooling, a total of about 380 
calls came in Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, about 25% more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people are thinking about it," said Jim Sims, Commuter Computer's 
president. "It remains to be seen what they'll do." 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that on Friday the volume of calls appeared to be back to 
its normal level. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the evidence is overwhelming that commuters and other consumers are 
sticking with familiar routines for now. For instance, the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District has pledged to put more buses on the streets and hire 
more drivers if an oil shortage is "declared." 
</P>
<P>
But at this point, ridership on RTD buses and the new Blue Line train from Long 
Beach to downtown isn't up significantly, said spokesman Greg Davy. 
</P>
<P>
Many New Yorkers said this week that they weren't changing their daily 
transportation plans, either. Said Tony Marciano, a Wall Street investment 
banker with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.: "This morning there were three people on 
the corner, and I waited for the next cab because I didn't feel like squeezing 
in -- crisis in the Persian Gulf or no crisis." 
</P>
<P>
It also was business as usual at home improvement stores. "Honestly, we're not 
rushing out and insulating all our homes and stuff," said the manager of a Home 
Depot store in Dallas. "You wouldn't know there's a gas crisis out there." 
</P>
<P>
Not that people are hostile to the idea of conserving energy. Debbie Boswell 
said the quality of the insulation of the new house she recently bought outside 
Atlanta was a "prime concern." 
</P>
<P>
"Even before this Gulf crisis, we wanted to conserve energy," she said. "If the 
crisis continues or worsens, we will have to modify our lifestyle by conserving 
gasoline for our car and pickup truck. Fortunately, we have a sailboat instead 
of a motorboat." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some businesses are cheerfully figuring that they eventually will 
prosper from an energy crunch. "People might not want to drive so far," 
explained George DeGirolamo, vice president for marketing at the Six 
Flags/Great America theme part in Gurnee, Ill. -- about halfway between Chicago 
and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"The energy crisis in 1978-79 was mildly beneficial because higher prices 
curtailed long-term plans and people looked for things closer to home," 
DeGirolamo added. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland officials aren't worried. During oil shortages, spokesman Bob Roth 
said, "locals tend to take shorter vacations, and we're high on their list of 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, consumers are doing little more than complaining about the 
prospect of higher energy prices. Many believe that the issue will soon 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer has been through so many of these things in the last 15 years 
that it'll take six months before they believe it," said Richard Spears, sales 
manager of Jim Bess Mercedes-Benz in Calabasas, where customers still are 
coming in for gas guzzlers. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Anderson, a 27-year-old oil title analyst in Houston, put it another way. 
"People at this point aren't taking the Iraqi situation seriously," he said. 
"They figure we'll go in there and kick their rear and win, and put an end to 
it all pretty quick. I just don't think prices are going to stay high. This is 
a short-term deal."

Wholesale prices edged down slightly in July, the government reported Friday, 
but analysts said the respite was bound to be short-lived as the economy braces 
for the impact of the past week's sharp rise in oil prices in response to the 
turmoil in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's monthly report showed that prices charged by producers 
dipped by 1/10th of a percentage point last month, following increases of 0.2% 
in June and 0.3% in May -- a welcome-enough trend by any measure. Energy costs 
plunged 0.5% during July. 
</P>
<P>
But economists were quick to point out that the July performance is likely to 
be reversed by the recent oil price increases, the effects of which are 
expected to spread throughout the entire economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any inflation before Iraq decided to create some," said Donald 
Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State 
University in Atlanta. But now, he added, "clearly we have an oil shock 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Reaser, senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, 
agreed. "The overall thrust of the report is that inflation remains under 
control," she said, mainly because of the Federal Reserve's continuing tight 
money and credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
But after the past week's oil price hikes, she said, the overall producer price 
index rise in August "should be quite alarming" -- possibly as high as 1.7%. 
Energy costs account for about 9% of the overall index. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, crude oil traded for $18 per barrel, but prices last week jumped to 
over $28 per barrel before easing to $25 or $26 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Reaser said, the price surge should show up at the retail level 
relatively quickly, but it also could be more muted, with consumer prices 
posting a rise of just under 1% for the month. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Friday's gloomy outlook, analysts said, if oil supplies continue to 
flow without interruption, the current oil price levels should not lead to 
sustained inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the crisis is resolved, oil prices are likely to retreat, and we should see 
this as a blip in the inflation rate," Reaser said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this incident will lead to double-digit inflation like the oil 
shocks of the 1970s," agreed Joel A. Popkin, an independent economist based in 
Washington. He added that he expects the rate of inflation without food or 
energy costs to remain steady at 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported that wholesale food prices were unchanged in July, 
following a small decrease in the previous month. Ratajczak said food prices 
should continue to decline despite the oil price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the cost of producing food will go up," he 
explained. But despite farmers' desires for higher prices, increased production 
in food markets worldwide should help keep prices down. The result, he said, 
"is that farmers will be squeezed." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts differed over longer-term forecasts for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The oil price increases "certainly heighten the risk of a recession," said Sara 
Johnson, an analyst at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Boston, because consumers' spending 
power has been diminished. 
</P>
<P>
But although GNP growth will be nominal, Johnson said, her firm is not 
predicting a recession at this time. "After the initial oil shock is absorbed," 
she added, inflation should stabilize at about 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Ratajczak noted that prices in the industrial sector are experiencing "a little 
bit of a flare-up." That, he said, is inconsistent with expectations of how the 
sector behaves in a recession. "July was not a recession month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, he said, because of other factors, including a decline in payroll 
employment, he predicted that a few months from now "people will probably say 
that the recession began in July." 
</P>
<P>
Popkin noted that prices of intermediate goods are usually the first to weaken 
and indicate the onset of recession. The government report indicated that 
prices for intermediate goods dropped in May and June and only held steady in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this does indicate that the run-up of the spring has ended," Popkin 
said.

DOW DIVES 42.33 AS HUSSEIN RATTLES THE MARKET AGAIN

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's call Friday for a pan-Arab rebellion sent the 
U.S. stock markets into disarray again, bringing to a cheerless end the 
market's fourth-straight losing week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, which had advanced 48 points Wednesday and 
Thursday, surrendered 42.33 to close at 2,716.58. The Dow thus gave up 93.07 
points, or 3.3%, for the week; it has surrendered 9.4% of its value since 
reaching an all-time high July 16 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
Only precious-metal shares and a few oil stocks did well. Investors seemed less 
eager to buy even the high-growth blue chips that had been the target of 
bargain hunting for the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
Volume was a modest 145.34 million shares, compared to 155.81 million on 
Thursday, as traders lightened their portfolios so they wouldn't be badly hurt 
by surprise developments over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The light volume maximized the effect of the computer-directed program trading 
that began in the early afternoon, just after Hussein's remarks were read on 
Iraqi television. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hussein called for a holy war against the non-Arab troops in the 
Persian Gulf and a rebellion against the Saudi king to seize the holy city of 
Mecca. An announcement later from Cairo that a majority of Arab leaders had 
agreed to send troops to help the Saudis did little to help stocks rebound, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"What the market really needs to know is what Hussein will do next, and the 
speech made it sound like it wouldn't be good," said Hildegard Zagorski, market 
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Among the broader indexes, the S&amp;P 500-stock index slid 4.42 points to 
335.52, for a loss of 1.3%. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was off 
2.09 to 184.15. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 was off 2.7% and the NYSE 
composite index surrendered 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 4.95 to 408.03. 
At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 339.32, down 
2.17. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts again offered only forecasts based on a premise that the 
Persian Gulf situation will stabilize. "If it begins to appear there's more 
stability in the next few days, then the institutions will start buying again," 
said Trude Latimer, analyst with the Josephthal &amp; Co. brokerage in New 
York. "If there's military developments, there's no predicting." 
</P>
<P>
The decline again caused the New York Stock Exchange to impose one of its 
"circuit breaker" rules to calm a chaotic market. After the Dow had dropped 50 
points by about 1:30 p.m. EDT, the Big Board said traders couldn't execute the 
stock portion of index arbitrage trades except after stock price upticks. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights among specific stocks included: 
</P>
<P>
* Oil issues were mostly higher. Texaco rose 1/4 at 63 1/8, Chevron was up 1 
1/8 at 78 and Pennzoil was up 1/2 at 81 3/8. But Amoco was down 1 at 55 3/4 and 
Exxon lost 1/4 to 51 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Precious-metals stocks rose as gold prices jumped higher. Hecla Mining was up 
1/2 at 12 1/4, Placer Dome rose 7/8 to 17 7/8, Newmont Gold was up 2 at 51 1/8, 
Homestake Mining was 1 1/2 at 21 7/8 and ASA Ltd. was up 1 3/4 at 52 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was down 1 1/4 at 102, 
Wal-Mart was off 3/4 at 29 7/8, Boeing lost 1 1/4 to 53 1/4, Eli Lilly was down 
2 3/4 at 75 1/4 and Unitel was up 1 1/8 at 26 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Argonaut, the L.A.-based insurer, was flat at 72. Goldman Sachs said it has a 
5.5% stake, bought for investment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks sank to their lowest close of the year. The Nikkei index of 
225 issues lost 286.18 points, or 1.04%, to close at 27,329.55 in quiet 
trading. It fell 2,186.21 points, or 7.4%, for the week. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices ended on a relatively quiet note after a nervous and 
hectic week with all eyes on the Middle East. The Financial Times 100-share 
index gave up 11.1 points to close at 2,233.8. It lost 50.8 points, or 2.2%, 
for the week. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, stocks ended mixed, with the 30-share DAX index 
down 6.29 points to close at 1,749.34, by far the smallest one-day swing this 
week -- a period in which the index has lost more than 90 points, or 5% in 
value.

COLUMBIA S&amp;L SUES 3, CHARGES FRAUD SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE AILING S&amp;L CLAIMS THAT $31 MILLION OF EQUIPMENT-LEASING DEALS 
WERE SET UP TO DEFRAUD IT. AN EX-OFFICER IS ACCUSED OF TAKING KICKBACKS.

Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. filed a lawsuit Friday against one of its 
former vice presidents and two other men, accusing them of taking part in a 
multimillion-dollar equipment-leasing fraud scheme against the ailing thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering suit filed in federal court accuses Jeffrey S. Worthy, 
Columbia's former director of financial planning, with taking more than $1 
million in kickbacks in the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The suit describes $31 million worth of leasing deals set up by Worthy, Michael 
E. Parker of Newport Beach and Brian W. Fink of Orange County as "an illegal 
scheme to defraud Columbia of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, Worthy and Fink could not immediately be reached for comment. Worthy's 
company J. S. Worthy Enterprises of Downey was also named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's now-bankrupt Costa Mesa company, Parker North American Corp., of which 
Fink was an executive, arranged leasing deals with Columbia between 1983 and 
1987 for equipment such as automated teller machines, computers and restaurant 
equipment, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the deals never occurred and the documents and invoices were created by 
the defendants, the suit states. In others, equipment prices were inflated or 
ownership of the equipment was sold to more than one investor, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leasing deals, Columbia would pay 20% in cash to PNAC to buy the 
equipment on Columbia's behalf, the suit said. The rest of the money would be 
provided by a third-party lender. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment would then be leased by PNAC to its ultimate user and the rental 
payments used to pay off the third-party loan. As the owner of the equipment, 
Columbia stood to garner significant tax benefits from the deals put together 
by PNAC.

Bond prices slipped Friday in light, volatile trading as participants took 
profits and fears grew that war could erupt in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 11/32 of a point, or $3.44 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.79% from 
8.75% Thursday. The Treasury had sold new 30-year bonds on Thursday at an 
average yield of 8.87%. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market had little reaction to a report showing inflation 
moderated last month. The government said wholesale prices in July edged down 
0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the report, which normally would be positive for the bond market, 
was discounted because it occurred before the Middle East crisis sent oil 
prices surging. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, bond prices were sent lower by bondholders who sold issues to take 
profits after the Treasury's quarterly refunding, which concluded Thursday, 
said Gib Clark of Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, investors concerned that the Iraqi situation could escalate were 
unwilling to hold large amounts of bonds over the weekend, furthering the 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, unchanged from late Thursday.

The dollar finished lower against most major currencies. Analysts said weakness

the dollar. Trading was light. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 150.40 yen in New York from 149.805 late Thursday. But it

On other markets, oil futures jumped; soybeans rallied; wheat futures plunged, 
and livestock and meat futures were mixed.

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's call for an Arab uprising against the United 
States frayed oil market nerves Friday and boosted crude prices. Gasoline 
prices at the pump, meanwhile, appeared to drop slightly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the oil market, traders remained cautious and appeared unwilling to take 
risky positions ahead of an uncertain weekend. As a result, energy prices 
closed off their highs for the day. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate for September delivery, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose 
56 cents to close at $26.23 a barrel after trading as high as $26.60. Unleaded 
gasoline rose 3.03 cents to 79.45 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like Hussein is backing down at all, but we are in a trading 
range here," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein called for Arabs to rally together against foreign intervention and 
urged Egyptians to bar foreign ships from passing through the Suez Canal, a 
vital link between the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. He also lashed 
out at Arab leaders who opened their lands to U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said players bid up the market at the opening and in the first hour in 
anticipation of developments out of the Arab summit in Cairo and in reaction to 
Hussein's speech. 
</P>
<P>
Bentz added that strong buying in oil products, particularly gasoline, helped 
lift crude prices. He said gasoline looked strong because, given consumer fears 
of gasoline lines, it seemed a surer thing than crude. 
</P>
<P>
Distant-month contracts of gasoline and heating oil were up the daily limit of 
2 cents a gallon, while comparable crude contracts were up only moderately. 
Volume was described as light. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Automobile Assn., in its daily survey of gasoline 
stations, said the average price for self-serve, unleaded fuel dipped 
nationwide by 0.3 cent to $1.25 per gallon -- the first decline since Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
AAA also said there are "adequate gasoline supplies to meet all current travel 
needs as well as those over the upcoming Labor Day holiday unless conditions 
significantly worsen in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Arco Products Co. President George Babikian released his 
promised white paper contending that oil companies are being unfairly accused 
of gouging consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline price hikes were coming anyway, Babikian said Friday, because of 
higher crude oil prices on the spot market -- up from $15.50 a barrel in 
mid-June to $20 by the end of July, before the Mideast crisis. He said that 
contrary to popular belief, oil price changes in the spot market affect 
gasoline prices within days, not weeks. About 47% of the oil used by U.S. 
refiners is subject to such "nearly instantaneous" change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then when spot prices go up, said Babikian, even refiners who do not buy on the 
spot market feel compelled to raise their prices too, to avoid customer runs on 
their low-priced gas and the risk of depleting their own gasoline supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the price increases made were defensive," Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil price hikes came again quickly after Aug. 2 from the "shock of the 
invasion," according to the Arco position paper, as well as low gasoline 
inventories. Particularly on the West Coast, noted Babikian, virtually every 
oil company was doing refinery maintenance work during the 2nd quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, wholesale and retail prices haven't increased as much as prices on the 
spot market, Babikian noted. He counseled consumers to avoid panic, 
particularly topping off their auto gas tanks, since U.S. reserves are now high 
and, unlike the earlier gas crisis, government price controls have not been 
imposed. Babikian blamed price-control mechanisms for soaring prices at the 
pump during the last oil crisis.

<P>
MOTOR SPORTS: SIMI VALLEY DRIVER CLOSING IN ON POINTS LEAD AS HE SEEKS HIS 
FOURTH CONSECUTIVE WINSTON 100 VICTORY AT SAUGUS.

It's August. It's hot and it's sticky. Dave Phipps' kind of weather. 
</P>
<P>
These are the dog days when Phipps labors in the garage of his Simi Valley home 
well into the night, with no air conditioning, working "until my bones fall 
asleep," to find an edge for his Sportsman division car. 
</P>
<P>
After all, can you find a hotter driver at Saugus Speedway right now? 
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Phipps was languishing 65 points behind points leader and defending 
champion Will Harper of Tarzana. Now, Phipps is second, just 38 points behind 
Harper entering tonight's Winston 100 at Saugus -- 60 laps more than a regular 
Sportsman race. 
</P>
<P>
This annual race -- worth double points in the standings -- has been won by 
Phipps three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the guys I always think of," Harper said, looking ahead to the 
100-lap race. "I always visualize a race before, and I can visualize Dave being 
right there. He's definitely one of the first guys I'm thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
It is not just tonight's event that concerns Harper. It's the next four 
weekends of Sportsman driving as the Saugus season heads into the homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely one of the guys I'm thinking about for the rest of the 
season," Harper said. "He's a strong finisher." 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, an unassuming 42-year-old with 11 years of driving experience, 
downplays the compliments. How does Phipps explain his three consecutive wins 
in the Winston 100? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably luck," he said seriously. Phipps' modesty belies the fact that he is 
a three-time Saugus Speedway points champion in the Sportsman division -- in 
1984, 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Phipps did receive a break in the '89 Winston 100. After leading for 
92 laps, Harper became entangled with some cars he was attempting to lap. 
Phipps, driving patiently in second place, zipped in for the win. 
</P>
<P>
"Will had me beat, and there wasn't much I could do about it," Phipps 
acknowledged. "I was just in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
But in 1988, Phipps led the final 40 laps. And in 1987, he passed Rich DeLong 
Jr. on the 99th lap. It seems, after all, there is more to Phipps' success than 
just luck. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is for sure, he doesn't have any leprechauns," Harper said. "He has 
experience. That's why he wins. He's got experience and talent and dedication 
and that has enabled him to take advantage of situations the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
The stage seems set for Phipps this year too. He finished second and third in 
his last two Sportsman races, displaying skilled driving in both races in 
jockeying for position after starting back in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"I really look forward to these 100-lap races," he said. "I really enjoy them. 
Maybe some of it is experience. I really don't know what I do other than that. 
I probably put a little extra effort into putting the car together, make sure 
everything is tight and adjusted. You know, this is two and a half times a 
regular 40-lap, but it's over before you know it. It's still a sprint race. 
</P>
<P>
"When momentum is with you, it's like any sport. Momentum gives you confidence. 
If you think you can do it, you can. And I feel like I have a really excellent 
chance of winning this race. Now, I mean, I don't feel like other guys 
(shouldn't) bother showing up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Phipps' voice trails off into laughter. But he's correct in anticipating a 
hungry pack of drivers. Consider that coming into tonight's race, six drivers 
are within 54 points of Harper. Right behind Phipps (218 points) in the points 
standings are some young, hard-charging drivers such as Reseda's Larry Krieger 
(215), Northridge's Keith Spangler (213) and Simi Valley's Craig Rayburn (208). 
And Reseda's John Cran (205) and Carson's Gary Sigman (202) aren't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Put it all together and Phipps and his streak are facing a stern challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The other guys are getting experienced too," Phipps said. "They aren't really 
beginners and they aren't going to quit. But I've done it before and I feel 
like I can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, in fact, is so geared up for the race that he is hoping that race 
officials will go with an inverted starting field, meaning the fastest cars 
start at the back. Phipps believes it will make things a little more exciting. 
And what's wrong with a little excitement, he reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the fast car doesn't start in the front," he said. "It's much more of a 
dull show. I'd rather see several guys compete for a position." 
</P>
<P>
Other drivers can only cringe at hearing that. It seems, gentlemen, that Dave 
Phipps is ready to start his engine.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?: JEFF NELSON; 
</P>
<P>
DISTANCE DANDY WALKED WHEN IT HURT TO RUN; 
</P>
<P>
UNTIMELY INJURIES ENDED PROMISING CAREER THAT PRODUCED U. S. RECORD AND 2 STATE 
TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
His former coach calls him the greatest distance-running talent in the United 
States, yet he has not raced seriously in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
A former teammate called him the heir-apparent to Olympian Steve Prefontaine. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to Jeff Nelson, such talk is a little unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Nelson set the national high school record of 8 minutes 36.3 seconds in 
the two-mile as a Burbank High senior in 1979. And yes, he stills holds the 
three-mile course record (14:32 in 1978) on the vaunted Mt. San Antonio College 
cross-country layout. But that's history. 
</P>
<P>
While he grudgingly admits that he had some success in high school, Nelson does 
not dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, those times never really seemed that impressive," he said. "I never 
really thought my marks were that good. But here it is, 11 years later, and 
they're still standing. . . . It does make you feel pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kemp, 51, Nelson's high-school coach, trained a slew of elite runners 
during his 16 years at Burbank. But he said none were comparable to Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was from another planet," Kemp said. "He was a one-in-a-million kid. 
The first time I saw Jeff run, I couldn't believe someone could come out of the 
woodwork with that kind of talent. 
</P>
<P>
"There was something about him that was so unique. I remember telling (Burbank 
Athletic Director) Frank Callum, 'This kid is going to be unbelievable.' Jeff 
just had that kind of natural talent." 
</P>
<P>
So why didn't he become the next Prefontaine? Part of the answer lies with 
Nelson, who still lives in Burbank, less than a mile from his parents, and who 
has spent the past seven years working as a pressman at Librascope, a defense 
contractor in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some elite runners, Nelson was never obsessed with his exploits. Nor did 
he derive a lot of ego gratification from his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Nelson was a big rock 'n' roll fan. He once ran in the high school 
1,500 meters in the Muhammad Ali Invitational wearing a Rolling Stones T-shirt 
with the patented Sticky Fingers lolling-tongue logo. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson ran for the fun of running, pure and simple. 
</P>
<P>
But after a series of injuries during his first three collegiate seasons -- the 
first at Oregon, the next two at Glendale College -- he gave up serious 
competition in 1982. And he was able to walk away without looking back. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what I did was right at the time," said Nelson, who won the two-mile 
run in the 1978 and 1979 state high-school championships. "I don't regret my 
decision. (1982) was the third season in a row that I'd been injured and 
running just wasn't worth it to me any more." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Linam, a teammate of Nelson's at Burbank who recently was named as 
cross-country coach at the school, said that running had never been "life and 
death" for Nelson, despite all his success. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly think it was just something fun for Jeff to do," Linam said. "He 
and Lin Whatcott were buddies in junior high and Lin's brothers had run at 
Burbank, so when they got to high school, running just seemed like the natural 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that Burbank's rich distance-running tradition influenced his 
decision to compete there, although he had never run competitively before. 
</P>
<P>
"In junior high, we had heard about guys like (Mark) Covert, (John) Musich and 
(Kevin) Burkin," Nelson said. "And we wanted to be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Covert went on to win the NCAA Division II cross-country title for Cal State 
Fullerton in 1970. Musich won the 880-yard run (1:51.0) in the 1974 state meet 
and Burkin set a then-Burbank record of 9:02.8 in the two-mile in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Burkin's record would stand for only two years, however, as Nelson lowered it 
four times during his career at Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth occasion took place in the Pepsi Invitational at UCLA in May, 1979. 
Competing against a field of Olympic-caliber runners, Nelson finished third in 
8:36.3. 
</P>
<P>
That mark destroyed Craig Virgin's national outdoor record of 8:40.9 and was 
also faster than Gerry Lindgren's indoor mark of 8:40.0 set in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
So when Nelson enrolled at Oregon, the comparisons to Prefontaine -- a former 
Oregon runner who broke every U. S. record from 2,000 through 10,000 meters -- 
were inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Salazar -- who would set U. S. records in the 5,000, 10,000 and 
marathon -- and Rudy Chapa -- who set a national record in the 3,000 -- were 
seniors at Oregon when Nelson arrived, and he was expected to follow in their 
footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson soon discovered the camaraderie that had existed among his teammates 
at Burbank was nowhere to be found at Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"Every workout was a race," said Nelson, who at 5-foot-7 and 140 pounds is 13 
pounds heavier than he was as a senior at Burbank. "Every run was incredibly 
intense and, being a freshman, I wasn't used to it. I felt like I was being 
thrown to the lions. . . . Your teammates weren't really teammates. Everyone 
was out for blood, all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his uneasiness with the Oregon way of doing things, Nelson was the No. 
5-man on a cross-country team that finished second in the NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting Burbank during the Christmas break, Nelson returned to Eugene in 
1980 with a renewed spirit. But things did not improve. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson had a major altercation with Salazar because he -- a freshman -- had the 
audacity to outkick the senior at the end of a workout. 
</P>
<P>
"That just wasn't done up there," Kemp chuckled. "The freshmen were supposed to 
be cannon fodder for the stars up there, and that went against everything Jeff 
knew. He felt that you always gave your best." 
</P>
<P>
After running 8:41 for two miles in an indoor meet in Portland, Nelson began to 
experience pain in his right ankle in the early part of the outdoor season. The 
Oregon coaching staff told him not to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"You weren't expected to get injured up there, and if you did, you were 
expected to run through it," Nelson said. "Their attitude was, 'If it hurts, 
just take more aspirin.' " 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Nelson had to stop running for several weeks. Although the injury 
developed into a stress fracture, Oregon Coach Bill Dellinger still expected 
him to run in the Pacific 10 championships in May. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of the final straw," Nelson said. "I told them that I was in no 
condition to race -- I was barely starting to run again -- but their attitude 
was, 'Look, you're on a full ride here, and we're going to get our money's 
worth out of you. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"I decided right then that I didn't need that kind of pressure. Running wasn't 
fun up there." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson transfered to Glendale College in the fall and led the Vaqueros to the 
state junior college cross-country title with a dominating victory at Griffith 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
He started the 1981 track season in fine form -- running a 4:04 anchor mile as 
Glendale set a national JC record in the distance medley relay -- but sciatic 
nerve problems sidelined him for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Having used up his junior college cross-country eligibility, Nelson trained for 
the 1982 track season after recovering from the injury. But when tendinitis in 
his left Achilles' tendon forced him to stop running again, he'd had enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wonder how far he would have gone if not for a couple of untimely 
injuries," said Whatcott, who ran in the 1984 Olympic Trials marathon and has a 
personal best of 2:14:09. "The guy was just a superior runner. He just seems to 
have this mechanism that turns on and you wonder if the guy is feeling any 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp echoed Whatcott's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad his career ended the way it did," he said. "Jeff is unlimited in 
what he's able to do in distance running. The only limitation is himself. . . . 
If he wanted to, if he really put his mind to it, I still think he could be the 
single greatest distance runner we have in America." 
</P>
<P>
But before attributing Kemp's comments to an overzealous coach glorifying one 
of his past athletes, consider the source. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp was the one who predicted, in 1977, that Nelson would break Virgin's 
national record for two miles. Kemp was the one who told Nelson he would run 
8:35 in the Pepsi meet in 1979, and Kemp was the one who ran 100 miles a week 
with Nelson during the summer before his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"(Jeff) believed fully in me and I believed completely in him," Kemp said. "And 
when that happens between a talented athlete and a coach, good things are bound 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
After running 9:28 in the two-mile to win the Southern Section 3-A Division 
sophomore title, Nelson won the 1978 state title in 8:59.28, upsetting Rod 
Berry of Larkspur High in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a real breakthrough race for me," Nelson said. "I still consider that 
the real highlight of my career. That was the first time I had broken nine 
minutes and it was my first state title. Plus, Berry had said some pretty cocky 
things in the paper about how he was going to run away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson outkicked him in a thrilling stretch battle. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's victory was doubly impressive because, due to a stress fracture, he 
had not run a track race until the Foothill League finals. 
</P>
<P>
The forced layoff didn't seem to bother him, however. He ran 9:18 in the 3-A 
prelims, 9:13 to win the 3-A finals, and 9:06 to tie for first in the Masters 
meet a week before the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any doubt in my mind that he could win state," Kemp said. 
"Without the stress fracture, he might have broken the national record as a 
junior." 
</P>
<P>
After running 100 miles a week -- including a high of 142 -- during the summer, 
Nelson entered the cross-country season in phenomenal shape. In the Mt. SAC 
Invitational, he ran 14:32 to smash the course record of 14:56. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, he capped his fall season with a victory in the 3-A championship 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's domination continued into the spring. He lowered his personal best to 
8:55.1 to win the high school two-mile at the Sunkist meet in January, then ran 
8:42.7 to finish seventh in the open race of the Jack in the Box Invitational 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Nelson finished fourth in the U. S. trials for the World Junior 
cross-country championships. 
</P>
<P>
In March, he placed fourth -- and was the top American -- in the World Junior 
meet in Limerick, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
On the track, he made sub nine-minute two-miles a common occurence, running 
8:55.0 in the Burbank Invitational, 8:36.3 in the Pepsi, 8:51.3 in the 3-A 
finals, 8:49.1 in the Masters meet and 8:47.35 in the state meet in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the significance of those clockings, consider that 10 years 
later, in 1988, Ernie Shepard of South Carolina was the only prep runner in the 
nation to better nine minutes -- and he did it just once. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Nelson's victory in the state meet that left an indelible mark in 
Kemp's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of the greatest things I ever saw," Kemp said. "The place was 
packed and on the entire last lap of the two-mile, the crowd gave Jeff a 
standing ovation." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that superb natural talent contributed to Nelson's success, 
but supreme confidence and a relaxed racing attitude were equally important. 
</P>
<P>
"(Jeff) was that rare person that never looked at anything and worried about 
the consequences," Linam, the cross-country coach, said. "I mean, I don't think 
the guy ever felt pressure." 
</P>
<P>
A case in point was the 1978 Mt. SAC Invitational in cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
As the teams milled about the starting line before the race, Nelson realized 
that he had to go to the bathroom. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to 
use the restroom, so Nelson was contemplating using a nearby ditch -- shielded 
from view by some Burbank supporters -- when the starter called the field to 
its marks. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't even faze him," Linam chuckled. "He just got up to the line and 
said, 'Oh, well, I can wait.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then he went out there and just blew everyone away." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has experienced a lot since his glory days. For one thing, he married -- 
then divorced. He has a 5-year-old daughter who will start kindergarten next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
But he still gets the itch to start training seriously again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in pretty good shape in December of '88," Nelson said. "But then I broke 
some bones in my foot in a freak accident trying to kick-start my motorcycle. . 
. . Everything was just cut so short (after high school). 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I think I did the right thing, but I've still been tempted in the 
past to come back and get in really good shape for an indoor two-mile. That's 
still very tempting."

SWEATSHOP BILL APPROVED, AWAITS GOVERNOR'S DECISION; L.A. UNION RALLY PLANNED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bill aimed at cracking down on the latest proliferation of garment sweatshops 
in the Orange and Los Angeles counties is heading to Gov. George Deukmejian's 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
The International Ladies' Garment Workers Union announced Friday that it would 
stage a rally in the Los Angeles garment district next week calling on the 
governor to approve the bill. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Senate approved the bill 21 to 12, the minimum required for 
passage. The measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), 
would make designer-name, garment-industry sweatshops, which employ underage 
children and immigrants at sub-minimum wages, responsible for labor abuses 
committed by their independent suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times 
revealed that many independent contractors still run sweatshops paying as 
little as $1.45 an hour to children and immigrants, including Southeast Asians 
relocating to such Orange County communities as Garden Grove, Santa Ana and 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held 
"jointly liable" for labor and safety violations committed by their 
subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of 
clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece 
rate often translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden had predicted that his bill would pass the Legislature and said the 
biggest test would be whether Deukmejian would sign it into law. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Kerrigan, a spokesman for the Department of Industrial Relations, which 
is responsible for state labor-law enforcement, said the agency has remained 
neutral through the legislative debate and has not yet decided whether to 
recommend that the governor sign or veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Nutter, regional director for the garment workers' union, on Friday 
called the bill "more of a human rights issue than a labor issue." He said the 
union will seek a meeting with the governor to urge him to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's passage comes as the Industrial Relations Department, whose budget 
for labor-law enforcement has already been slashed, faces another $7-million 
shortfall as a result of the current budget crisis, a situation, Nutter said, 
that opens the door to rampant abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine the amount of time actually spent doing garment industry 
enforcement is small indeed, much smaller than 10 years ago," Nutter added.

POOL OFFICIAL HAS STROKE AFTER ONE MAN DROWNS

In a tragic chain of events Friday, an Irvine man died after losing 
consciousness at the bottom of a community swimming pool and during the ensuing 
commotion the manager of the pool collapsed from a near-fatal stroke. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people were swimming and playing in the Olympic-size pool when the man 
disappeared under 9 feet of water. Many of the people were young children 
participating in summertime swimming classes. It took a few minutes for the 
stricken man to be rescued, police said, party because other pool-goers at 
first thought he was swimming underwater. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by police as Dinh Quan, 54, was pronounced dead on arrival 
at College Hospital Costa Mesa after the 4:25 p.m. incident at the Village Park 
Recreation Center pool in the 4500 block of Michelson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The pool manager, identified by police and relatives as Mary Hatt, 45, of 
Irvine, was listed in critical condition at Healthcare Medical Center of 
Tustin. Her husband, Daryle Hatt, who was at the pool at the time, said late 
Friday that his wife had suffered a stroke and was not responding to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Hatt said that his wife was on-site manager of the pool, which is operated by 
the Village Park Homeowners Assn. in the University Park section of Irvine. The 
pool is open to members and guests of the 636-home association. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Quan declined comment when reached at the College Hospital 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was to be conducted on Quan to determine the cause of death, Rodgers 
said. According to witnesses at the scene, Quan had been at the bottom of the 
pool for at least four minutes, police said, and was registering no pulse when 
rescuers pulled him out. 
</P>
<P>
"You could just see that he was full of water," said Alex Abshier, a swim 
instructor who dove down to retrieve the stricken man. "He was all bloated and 
blue." 
</P>
<P>
According to Police Sgt. Ron Flathers, one swim student was practicing in the 
deep end of the pool when he noticed a man lying face-down on the bottom in the 
deep section. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Flathers said, the student thought the man was holding his breath, 
but then realized something was amiss. The student yelled for Abshier to help. 
Abshier, who was teaching a child at the shallow end of the pool, said he swam 
over immediately as a lifeguard sitting in a tower also ran to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him lying there so I carried him up to the top of the surface," said 
Abshier, 20, an Irvine resident and UC Irvine student. "The lifeguard ran 
around the deck and helped me pull him out of the water. I yelled for someone 
to call 911. Then I began CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and 
mouth-to-mouth. But he wasn't breathing at all. He had no pulse." 
</P>
<P>
While the rescue efforts were under way, witnesses said Hatt was excitedly 
telling everyone to get out of the pool. Suddenly, Flathers said, she began 
experiencing severe breathing problems and sat down on a lounge chair near the 
stricken Quan. Signy Peck, 19, a swim coach from Irvine who happened to be 
nearby, said Hatt appeared to be crying and was perspiring heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"She looked very upset," Peck said. "I asked, 'Are you OK, Mrs. Hatt?' She 
turned away and kind of collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
While trying to revive Quan, Abshier said he remembers hearing Peck yelling 
that a woman needed CPR. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really scary," Abshier said. "I was thinking, 'What is going on?' " 
</P>
<P>
It took Irvine police and paramedics between three and five minutes to arrive 
after being called, witnesses at the pool said. In the meantime, Peck and a 
friend visiting from Boston, Sarah Selder, 19, tried to revive Hatt. They took 
turns applying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and checking her pulse.

HUNGER SURVEY SHOWS CHILDREN SUFFER THE MOST; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: NO ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY IS STARVING, BUT ACCESS TO FOOD IS A 
GROWING PROBLEM.

<P>
The impact of hunger in Orange County falls heaviest on children, with more 
than 50% of the people who need emergency food on a daily basis being under 18 
years of age, according to a survey conducted by University of California 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-quarter of parents surveyed reported they were forced to send 
their children to bed hungry some of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the survey found that almost half of those with children eligible for 
school breakfast and lunch programs and more than three-quarters of those 
eligible for food stamps were not participating in those programs. Ignorance of 
what is available, pride and lack of food programs in local schools contribute 
to this lack of participation, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of programs to combat hunger say that while the survey indicates that 
no children are starving, chronic malnutrition could wreak long-term havoc on 
the emotional, mental and physical well-being of the county's children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of starvation that exacts a debilitating toll on young children 
over their lifetime," said Michelle Van Eyken, county coordinator of the 
federally funded Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, at an Anaheim 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The survey reinforces impressions that have been difficult to quantify before: 
While no one in Orange County is starving, hunger and malnutrition are growing 
problems that are often masked, said study co-author Ann Cotter, a UC home 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by University of California Cooperative Extension 
Services, which conducts research and provides educational services to county 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers surveyed 60 soup kitchens and pantries that serve about 80,000 
people monthly who suffer from chronic or occasional shortages of food. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 7,000 seniors and handicapped individuals are served by 
four programs that assist them with groceries and meals. Another estimated 
100,500 county residents participate in U.S. Department of Agriculture 
emergency food programs each month. 
</P>
<P>
"What the report shows is that the problem of hunger exists in Orange County 
despite its reputation for wealth," Cotter said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in interviews conducted with 191 emergency food clients -- who 
represented 678 family members -- none identified himself or herself as 
transient and scarcely 18% were homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nearly 57% of the respondents said they were employed. 
</P>
<P>
"The image we have of the hungry person in Orange County is of a homeless 
person," said Alison Armstrong, a member of a review committee charged with 
making recommendations based on survey results. "But the people we see on the 
street who are recognizably in need represent only a small minority." 
</P>
<P>
Other survey results revealed that: 
</P>
<P>
* Families with children accounted for more than 86% of those seeking emergency 
food assistance, with almost 31% of the families consisting of five or more 
members. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 84% had incomes below the federal poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
* At least 71% of the clients said they spent at least some time thinking about 
where their next meal would come from. 
</P>
<P>
* Sixty-seven percent rated the quality of their diets as fair to poor. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons given for the lack of participation in school lunch or breakfast 
and federal food stamp programs varied: Twenty-eight percent of the respondents 
said they did not think they were eligible, 18% said they didn't know about 
them, and more than 20% said they did not want to apply. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lowry, a member of the survey review committee and director of a local 
food bank, said that while many eligible people do not receive food because of 
the stigma associated with such assistance, many others are not given adequate 
access. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is the only urban county in the state that provides no summer 
lunch program for its schoolchildren," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Doti, county director of financial assistance, said the county has 
increased its effort to try to bridge an acknowledged gap in services. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen the study results, so I don't know how they arrive at their 
conclusion," he said. "But federal studies do indicate that, roughly, only 59% 
of people who are eligible are receiving assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Doti said the county has recently simplified registration forms and developed a 
single form for food stamp and Aid to Families With Dependent Children 
applicants. The county has also begun a program in South County to mail food 
stamps directly to clients instead of having them redeemed at outlets, as had 
been the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can agree with the survey that the numbers of people who are hungry 
and need assistance are increasing," Doti said. "But it looks like government 
at all levels (is) broke. There are a lot of things out there that do not make 
it look better for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations outlined in the report include: 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing support of all kinds for the county's two food banks and other 
agencies that provide a safety net of emergency food services. 
</P>
<P>
* Expanding local gleaning programs and cooperative food purchase programs such 
as Meal Deal and Food Plus. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing the minimum wage and availability of job training and child care 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Encouraging local neighborhoods and city governments to cooperate with and 
support service providers. 
</P>
<P>
* Educating people at risk of hunger about available food resources. 
</P>
<P>
"The recommendations are ambitious, but they are achievable," said Delores 
Barrett, a director at the Salvation Army who helped prepare the 
recommendations. "In a county where the median income is above $50,000, it is 
not acceptable that a child go hungry or worry about where his next meal is 
coming from."

COUPLE AWARDED $2.5 MILLION IN CHAIR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Marguerite Healy sat on a folding chair aboard the Queen Mary in Long 
Beach six years ago, she was the sole caretaker for a quadriplegic husband. 
</P>
<P>
The chair collapsed, and Healy was left paralyzed by the resulting injury. 
Since then, the Laguna Niguel investment counselor has been unable to care for 
her husband, James Healy, or even earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the couple was awarded $2.5 million in damages by an Orange County 
Superior Court jury, which found that the chair had been defective. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, rendering its decision after a three-month trial, concluded that the 
chair collapsed because it had been held together with screws instead of more 
secure rivets. The damages were levied against an exhibitor who set up the 
chairs on an interior exhibition deck of the liner and the furniture 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel justice has been done," Healy, 43, said Friday from her home. "We don't 
have any plans at this point. We're trying to put our life back together." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the defendants, Industry Exhibitors Service of Pomona and 
Samsonite Furniture Co. of Tennessee, could not be reached for comment Friday 
on whether they will appeal the decision in the trial, held in Municipal Court 
in Westminster. The jury deliberated for a day and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened Sept. 22, 1984. Healy and her husband -- also 43, who 
became disabled in 1969 in an accident while serving with the Marine Corps -- 
were exhibitors in an investment show, the couple's court petition states. The 
Healys had started an investment business about two years earlier and had 
attended many investment shows around the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the show, Healy was sitting on a metal-and-plastic folding 
chair at her exhibit booth while her husband was meeting with other vendors, 
the court petition states. Suddenly, the chair collapsed beneath her, and she 
fell to the deck, hitting the back of her head on a rear display table, the 
petition states. 
</P>
<P>
"Other exhibitors said she hit so hard it sounded like a gunshot," said the 
couple's attorney, Thierry P. Colaw of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The fall caused permanent damage to the nerves and blood vessels on Healy's 
right arm and leg, leaving her with some paralysis and in nearly constant pain 
along her right side, Colaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she can walk unaided and has made some improvement, Colaw said, Healy 
cannot perform such tasks as housecleaning, shopping and washing and is unable 
to do the bending and stooping needed to care for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Healy had to hire attendants to care for her husband, Colaw added, and the 
couple's investment business failed because Healy could not carry documents or 
travel to keep the business going. 
</P>
<P>
The couple in 1985 filed suit in Orange County Superior Court, alleging that 
the exhibitor who set up the chairs and the manufacturer of the failed chair 
were liable for a product defect. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony revealed that up to four screws had been missing from the bottom of 
the chair. "When the last of the screws pulled out, the chair collapsed," Colaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several other claims had been filed against Samsonite, testimony also showed -- 
also for chairs that had collapsed because of screws falling out. In fact, 
Colaw said, Samsonite in 1980 changed the design so that the chairs are now 
held together with more secure rivets. The chair in question was manufactured 
before 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a relatively simple case of a poorly designed and maintained chair 
collapsing, with tragic results," Colaw argued in the court petition that led 
to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lee King, the owner of Industry Exhibitors Service, said in a deposition that 
the chairs are inspected when opened for an exhibit, with pressure put on the 
seat to test stability. 
</P>
<P>
King also testified that the chair came from a group of similar Samsonite 
chairs that he had bought from an exhibitor and had been used about 20 times in 
the six years before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Healy, Colaw said, "happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
In the decision, the jury found that the exhibitor is 65% liable for damages 
because it did not detect the loose and missing screws when the chairs were set 
up and that the manufacturer is 35% liable because of the product defect. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded $1.5 million to Marguerite Healy and about $1 million to her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Although relieved at the verdict, Healy said the last six years have been hard 
ones for her and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope," she said, "that no one ever has to go through what we have had to go 
through."

During the last five years, the size of the county's total nonagricultural

A San Bernardino County man was convicted in Santa Ana on Friday on federal 
charges stemming from his racially motivated shooting attack on a black 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors who heard the 3-day trial in U.S. District Court convicted Gary D. 
McInnis of one count of using intimidation to interfere with housing rights on 
the basis of race and one count of using a gun to commit a felony. 
</P>
<P>
McInnis, 39, of Hesperia faces sentencing by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer 
Letts on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
McInnis opened fire with a rifle on the Hesperia home of Oleatha Keller on Jan. 
26, striking her at least once. She has since recovered. Bullet fragments 
removed from her abdomen matched those taken from McInnis' rifle, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies who searched McInnis' garage found 
several rifles and shotguns and ammunition. They also found items that 
suggested race-related hostility, including swastikas, insignia of a 
white-supremacist group and figures of blacks and a monkey hanging by their 
necks from nooses. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;

<P>
JUDGE PONDERING BOOTLEG APARTMENTS

<P>
A Superior Court judge said Friday that he will rule in a few weeks on a 
class-action lawsuit against the city of Laguna Beach that could determine the 
fate of hundreds of bootleg apartments in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
With documents piled neck-high on each side of the bench, Judge William F. 
McDonald listened Friday as attorneys presented opposing viewpoints in what has 
become the most contentious dispute to arise from South Laguna's annexation by 
Laguna Beach 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that Laguna Beach attempted to eliminate bootleg units, 
also called granny flats, from South Laguna, where the units proliferated under 
more relaxed county building standards. Lawyers estimate that as many as 600 
people who own or rent bootleg apartments will be affected by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The South Laguna community has been bitterly divided over the issue of granny 
flats. Some say the units are integral to the community and provide affordable 
housing for renters and needed income for property owners who sometimes live on 
a shoestring budget. Others say add-on units have caused overcrowding problems 
and parking headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit focuses on the city's handling of bootleg apartments during an

E. GERMAN TEACHERS GET FACTS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From now on, when Gudrun Sickert teaches her East German students about life in 
America, she will be teaching them lessons she has learned herself. 
</P>
<P>
Until a month ago, the 34-year-old teacher's impressions of the United States 
were limited to the movies and to what she had been taught in school. But now, 
after spending a month in Orange County along with 10 other East German 
teachers, those impressions have changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
As she prepared to return home on Friday, Sickert expressed her excitement over 
no longer being limited to showing her students slides provided to her by the 
government, which she said depicted a slanted view of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of the slides were of the homeless," Sickert said in fluent English. "The 
other slides consisted of workers in factories who appeared extremely 
exploited. These did not present a very good view of America. Now I can tell my 
pupils much more about the United States, and I think they will believe me." 
</P>
<P>
During their monthlong stay, the teachers were matched with host families 
throughout the county. They participated in several forums at local colleges 
and visited typical tourist attractions such as Disneyland, Sea World, Palm 
Springs and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Their trip was arranged by the American Host Foundation, a Garden Grove-based 
organization which has brought more than 16,000 teachers to the United States 
from overseas since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
These teachers were selected by the foundation because of their stand against 
Marxist-Leninist teachings. Shortly before political reforms took place in the 
country, the teachers had formed the Union of Independent Teachers for 
Democracy, which was opposed to teaching children communism as a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
"The only places we were allowed to speak was in churches," said Sickert, who 
serves as spokeswoman for the group. "We met with parents who were having 
trouble with the education system and with all people interested in changing 
education." 
</P>
<P>
In October, several teachers in the group were in danger of being dismissed 
from their jobs when they backed a colleague who refused to continue with 
traditional teachings. But in the midst of the controversy, the opening of the 
Berlin Wall and other changes took place in the country and the controversy 
faded. 
</P>
<P>
"When we formed the organization, we just wanted to improve things," Sickert 
said. "We didn't think there would be such changes. It took us some time to 
understand it all. 
</P>
<P>
"I think only a person who has been to prison for many years could understand 
how we felt," Sickert said. "We were treated like small children and told how 
to do things and what to do. Now, we use our brains and can be human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Although they are experiencing freedom for the first time, the teachers said 
their country is still struggling through great economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to be free, but there are many troubles," said Heidemarie 
Schoeler, who teaches engineering. "The factories don't know how to stand the 
competition of the Western world. They have old technology and machinery." 
</P>
<P>
But the euphoria of freedom has yet to wear off. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel as if we were born again," said Monika Beul, who teaches Russian and 
music. "It's a new life." GREG HERNANDEZ

2 MEN SHOT DURING ON-RAMP ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were shot and wounded early Friday morning as they argued with 
occupants of another car on an on-ramp to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Leif Danielson, 22, of Greeley, Colo., was shot in the left foot, and Kenneth 
Miller, 22, of Costa Mesa was shot in the left thigh about 2:25 a.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both were taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center, said Seal Beach police 
dispatcher Carl Liebold. 
</P>
<P>
Danielson remained in the hospital Friday after undergoing surgery, while 
Miller was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Danielson and Miller were heading onto the southbound lanes of the San Diego 
Freeway at the 7th Street on-ramp when they got into a confrontation with the 
occupants of a late-model, red Pontiac Trans-Am, Liebold said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the unidentified occupants in the Pontiac suddenly opened fire, striking 
Danielson and Miller, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Danielson and Miller bleeding in their stopped car when they 
responded to calls from an unidentified witness. Liebold said police 
investigators did not know the nature of the dispute or whether the victims 
knew the assailants.

GUNMAN ROBS STORE OF 12 ROLEX WATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Friday were looking for a gunman who robbed a jewelry store of a bag 
full of Rolex watches but passed up diamond and silver pendants, brooches, 
necklaces and rings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was only interested in the Rolex watches," Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The dozen watches taken during the holdup were estimated to be worth about 
$20,000, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred shortly before 5 p.m. Thursday at Charles Barr Jewelers, 
located in the busy West Cliff shopping center near the intersection of Irvine 
Avenue and 17th Street. It was the second daylight jewelry heist in Newport 
Beach in two weeks. However, police do not believe the two robberies are 
linked, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis also said that there was no reason to suspect that Thursday's robbery was 
connected to the series of robberies in Los Angeles County by the so-called 
"Rolex bandits" who rob people on the street and steal their high-priced 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
"This appears to be an isolated incident," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said that the robber walked into the jewelry store when there were no 
customers in the store. 
</P>
<P>
He asked one of two clerks to show him one of the dozen Rolex watches on 
display. When the clerk reached in for the watch, the man pulled out a handgun 
and demanded that the clerk put the 12 watches in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
He then ordered the two employees to sit on the floor behind the glass cases 
while he made his getaway. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw the man walk casually outside, jump into a blue compact car and 
drive away, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The car was found by police a few minutes later in a nearby residential area, 
Gonis said. The car was later determined to have been stolen earlier in the day 
in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as a tall, white man in his 30s, with long, dark blond 
hair pulled into a tight ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
Police were also looking for a man who walked into the Jewels by Madonna at 11 
a.m. on July 31, tied up two employees and escaped with an unspecified amount 
of jewelry. JAMES M. GOMEZ

COUNCIL BACKS STREET WORK -- IN ANAHEIM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vowing to protect homes on the south side of Katella Avenue from the bulldozer, 
Garden Grove City Council members said they will go along with county plans to 
widen the street, but only if land for the expansion comes from the north side 
of Katella, which is in the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Pending cooperation from various cities, the Orange County Transportation 
Commission wants to designate Katella Avenue a "super-street," which could mean 
widening the thoroughfare to handle more traffic, with bus turn-outs and 
right-turn-only lanes added and traffic signals synchronized. Katella is one of 
three streets being considered for funding and designation as a super-street. 
The others are Imperial Highway and Moulton Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
This week, several Garden Grove residents told the council they did not want 
their homes on the south side of Katella knocked down for the project. But Lisa 
Mills, OCTC director of planning, told the council that bulldozing may not be 
confined to just one side. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you'd be more comfortable if all the widening was done by taking from 
the north side," Mills said. "And there are some good reasons to do that, but I 
can't legally commit to that now." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the council voted 4 to 1 to approve the designation of Katella as 
a super-street but with the condition that the land be taken from the Anaheim 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman J. Tilman Williams refused to go along with the majority 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't support this at all," he said. "What we need is an alternative form of 
transportation. I don't think that putting more and more cars on the streets is 
the answer. It's just going to make it worse down the line." 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Littrell told the audience, "What we did here tonight was kill 
(the project), because I don't think that Anaheim can live with having all the 
land taken from its side." JIM TORTOLANO

MULDOON TUNES UP FOR CHALLENGE OF OPEN ROAD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Muldoon is a classical music fan and the Race Across America offers him 
plenty of chance to broaden his repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
As the 34-year-old electrical engineer from St. Joseph, Mich., was seen going 
down the backroads of West Texas, his arms conducted with an imaginary baton 
music being played over a speaker on the top of his van. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone along the road seems to enjoy Muldoon's musical taste. 
</P>
<P>
"The cows don't like Beethoven," said Jim Muldoon, Al's brother and crew chief. 
"They like the Doobie Brothers and Boston." 
</P>
<P>
A bit later, the crew switched to the Doobies, and a horse looked up. 
</P>
<P>
"See, even the horses like this better," Jim told Al. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was back to the matter of the race for Muldoon, who is in third 
of the men's division. He was eighth last year. 
</P>
<P>
Almost seven hours up in front, Rob Kish of Port Orange, Fla., continues to 
streak forward in the lead. He and Bob Fourney of Denver were the only riders 
to pass through Corsicana, Tex., by 9 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
Kish came through at 7:05 p.m. and was near Athens, Tex., 1,883 miles into the 
race as of 9 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
Kish was riding easily in the heat, as he moves along with his shirt off in the 
85-degree, humid Texas night. 
</P>
<P>
Six days into the race, Kish has become the first male rider to lead for two 
consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
Fourney is second, 1 hour 52 minutes behind the leader. Rich Fedrigon of 
Chicago is fourth. Kish, Fourney, Muldoon and Fedrigon have traded off in the 
top four spots for the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Penseyres of San Juan Capistrano is in 10th place, about 350 miles in back 
of first. 
</P>
<P>
The women's field was reduced to four riders Friday when Kay Ryschon of Omaha, 
Neb., retired in Trinidad, Colo., because of a hyper extended neck muscles. 
Ryschon led most of the first two days. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reposo of Newport, R.I., led for the second consecutive day. She was near 
Cone, Tex., the mid-point of the race at 9 p.m. (PDT) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Mack of Seattle is second, more than 100 miles behind and Michelle 
Grainger of Portland, Ore., who is in third, 150 miles out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The men's tandem division was reduced to one team Friday when Lon Haldeman of 
Harvard, Ill., and Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook had to withdraw. Penseyres 
suffered from saddle sores and altitude sickness most of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Penseyres and Haldeman had each won the individual RAAM twice, and were trying 
to break the tandem record they set in last year's RAAM. The pair made it 
across the country in 7 days 14 hours 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Breedlove of Des Moines, Iowa and Roger Charleville of Cincinnati now will 
chase the record. They are 1,497 miles into the race in Post, Tex., where Post 
Cereals were started. The tandem race started Monday, a day after the 
individuals race began.

DALHART, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney White opened time station No. 21 at 1:30 a.m. (PDT) Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He was just in time to watch Rob Kish, the leader in the Race Across America, 
pedal past in the darkness. With a blue magic marker, White wrote down Kish's 
name and the time he passed on a makeshift leader board. A moment later he 
picked up a phone and called in Kish's time to RAAM headquarters at the Downey 
Cyclery. 
</P>
<P>
And then White waited. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime around 4 a.m., John Marino, RAAM's race director, drove up in the 
officials' van to say hello and make sure everything was in order. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:14 a.m., Bob Fourney, riding in second place, rolled into and out of the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
And White waited some more. Almost 90 minutes later, Al Muldoon, in third 
place, slipped past. 
</P>
<P>
Around 8 a.m., without a fourth-place rider in sight, White shut the door and 
went to work for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
By noon he was back. Richard Fedrigon's advance crew was there, plotting its 
next move. But Fedrigon, in fourth place, was still almost 100 miles from 
Dalhart. 
</P>
<P>
The riders had passed 20 time stations over more than 1,200 miles before 
rolling into the Texas panhandle town of Dalhart. In all, there are 49 
stations, some manned and some not, between the start last Sunday in Irvine and 
the finish in Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
In Desert Center, Calif., time station No. 2 was at Mike Karr's recreational 
vehicle parked at an Interstate 10 off-ramp. In Flagstaff, Ariz., No. 6 was in 
a gravel lot next to Maverik Country Store. At Mexican Hat, Utah, No. 10 was 
the San Juan Motel. 
</P>
<P>
None, however, has been located at an old railroad caboose. 
</P>
<P>
Just past Hardee's restaurant on U.S. 385, sharing the same parking lot, is 
Dalhart's visitors center -- a bright red caboose. 
</P>
<P>
Script letters read: Discover Dalhart Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is the Nursanickel Motel. Many crews, and even a few riders, 
will grab a shower and sleep there for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
White, Dalhart's 39-year-old chamber of commerce director and resident cycling 
nut, has set up shop in the town's most distinctive landmark. 
</P>
<P>
He and four others will rotate shifts at the caboose, recording times, giving 
road and weather updates and yelling encouragement, until the last rider has 
passed. It's the only method of keeping track of the cyclists' cross-country 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope I don't miss anyone," said White, who also ran the Dalhart time 
station last year. 
</P>
<P>
This far into the 2,922-mile race, the riders have opened huge gaps among 
themselves. One of the tricks to operating a time station is whiling away the 
hours between riders. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll just study the history in this caboose," said Jeannie Hutchison, 
one of White's assistants. "I'm a lifelong Dalhart resident and I've never been 
in it (the race) before today." 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, a traveler climbed the steps of the caboose asking for 
directions to a Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you go back here a block, then turn at Main, then go about three blocks 
to Third and it's on your left," Hutchison said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems there will be plenty for her to do for the next three days or so. 
</P>
<P>
Most time stations are run by local bicycle racers like White and Hutchison, 
who can stay at home during their off hours. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Flagstaff, that was not the case. Time station No. 6 was operated by 
members of a cycling club in Tucson, a six-hour drive in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Richard DeBarnardis, the club's director, led three others up Interstate 17 
Monday morning. He was planning to give each rider who made it to Flagstaff a 
commemorative medal and give a trophy to the first man and woman to reach 
Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere outside Phoenix, the engine in his car blew. He stopped for 
repairs while three others continued in another car without him. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Srader took over as the time station chief, welcoming the riders with 
medals. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell, a strong wind came up and the temperature began to drop and the 
crew bundled up for their first night of RAAM. Some went to a nearby motel to 
sleep and stay warm for the day shift. 
</P>
<P>
Their hardship hardly seemed mentioning when you compare it to the RAAM riders' 
trials and tribulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I know by Wednesday I'll be back home in Tucson," Srader said. "The riders 
have to keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
The riders passed frequently, still bunched tightly after 501.9 miles. There 
didn't seem time to get bored, not with Srader's cheerleading each time a rider 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"We got here early, so we drove back to Williams (40 miles west of Flagstaff on 
I-40) to cheer the riders," she said. "They didn't know who we were, but they 
got so excited when we'd pass by, waving and honking." 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning the field had passed and time station No. 6 had closed. 
Srader and her co-workers were back home in Tucson.

SURFING SALT CREEK BEACH PRO-AM; 
</P>
<P>
ROBINSON PATIENTLY WAITS FOR PERFECT WAVE, GETS PERFECT SCORES

<P>
With six years of experience on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour, 
Ted Robinson knows when to wait for just the right wave. 
</P>
<P>
And Friday at Salt Creek Beach, he waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson's chance finally came. He scored two perfect 10s and three 9.5s on 
a three-foot wave with eight minutes left to hold on for a win in his 
fourth-round heat at the Laguna Sportswear pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had to take anything I could get and I was hoping for the best," said 
Robinson, 26, of Manhattan Beach. "I had to grab what I could. It paid off to 
be patient, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I was behind at first and I knew I had to do something. It was a real treat to 
get one that big." 
</P>
<P>
Under most circumstances, a three-foot wave isn't considered big. But surfers 
have struggled with one- and two-foot waves all week at Salt Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real challenge," said Robinson, who has competed on 25- to 30-foot 
waves in Hawaii. "It's so hard to stay in tune with the small waves." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the heat weren't quite as fortunate. Robinson easily held off 
second-place finisher Ryan Keenan of Huntington Beach, who also advanced to 
today's first round of the main event. Dwayne Maki of Daytona, Fla., was third 
and Christian Fletcher of San Clemente was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"These young guys come out here and have nothing to lose against me," Robinson 
said. "Everyone's dogging each other out there. We're not nice to each other at 
all, at least not in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is ranked 32nd overall on the ASP world tour, with his best finish 
being a ninth at Narrabeen, Australia, in April. He competes in Professional 
Surfing Assn. of America events such as the one at Salt Creek during breaks on 
the world tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The best is yet to come," said Robinson, whose best finish on the PSAA tour is 
a third at Imperial Beach in June. "I want to win one of these badly, and I 
won't stop surfing them until I do." 
</P>
<P>
He just has to be patient, though. 
</P>
<P>
Dial a surfer: Oakland slugger Jose Canseco soon will have some competition on 
the 900 toll telephone number market. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and two Manhattan Beach pals have set up a 900 telephone number for 
fans who want to listen to top pro surfers on the ASP world tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids can call in and punch in a code to pick the surfer they want to 
listen to," Robinson said. "If they want to listen to Martin Potter talk about 
floater (maneuvers), they'll dial one number. If they want to hear Derek Ho 
talk about surfing Pipeline, they punch in another number." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson will tape the interviews for the 1-900-PRO-SURF line, which begins 
operation Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County surfers were eliminated in Friday's fourth round, 
including Mike deNicola of Mission Viejo, Laka Burgess of Huntington Beach, 
Kasey Curtis of San Juan Capistrano, Joey Zintel of Huntington Beach, Scott 
Desidero of El Toro, Christian Fletcher of San Clemente, Matt Coleman of Dana 
Point, Kirk Tice of Huntington Beach, Darren Brilhart of Costa Mesa and Donavon 
Frankenreither of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Chuy Reyna of Oceanside continues to be the hottest surfer in the trials, 
winning his fourth consecutive heat Friday. Reyna edged Brock Little, one of 
the top big-wave riders in Hawaii, in their heat. 
</P>
<P>

Keating Counterplan: Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of bankrupt American 
Continental Corp., filed a reorganization plan Friday in federal court in 
Phoenix that is in opposition to an earlier plan filed jointly by the company's 
unsecured creditors and federal regulators. American Continental, which filed 
for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, is the one-time parent company of 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the failed thrift that is expected to 
cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the features of the Keating proposal are a $50-million payment to 
creditors that would be made two years after confirmation of the plan. It would 
also provide the Resolution Trust Corp. -- the government agency created to 
sell off assets of failed thrifts -- an option to pay $21 million to creditors 
in exchange for dropping Lincoln as a defendant in certain lawsuits related to 
Lincoln's receivership. The plan would also include buying certain American 
Continental assets for about $580 million, plus interest, by a new company to 
be headed by Keating and other current and former American Continental 
managers.

LAGUNA MUSEUM HONORS EARLIER L.A. MODERNISTS; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBIT: 'TURNING THE TIDE: EARLY LOS ANGELES MODERNISTS 1920-1956' DISCREDITS 
THE NOTION THAT MODERN ART DIDN'T BEGIN IN CALIFORNIA UNTIL THE '50S AND '60S.

<TEXT>
<P>
On Oct. 27, 1941, Life magazine did a story on the new wave of art combining 
"freedom and tradition" that was coming out of California. This art was created 
in a land less cramped for space than the East or Midwest, the article burbled, 
the "land of experiment." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Susan Ehrlich pointed out in her lecture at the Laguna Art Museum on 
Thursday, the article never mentioned any of the modernist artists who really 
embodied the spirit of the new in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich, 47, is co-curator with Barry M. Heisler of "Turning the Tide: Early 
Los Angeles Modernists 1920-1956," an exhibit (at the Laguna museum through 
Sept. 16) that aims to correct the prevailing notion that no truly innovative 
work was done in the Southland before the crush of well-known artists of the 
late '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Moving with brisk good humor through a discussion of works by several of the 
artists in the show, Ehrlich, a professor of art history at USC, made a point 
of discussing interwoven influences on the artists' work. 
</P>
<P>
These diverse influences included the still-pristine expanse of coastal 
landscape, friendships (with other artists as well as collectors and members of 
the film community, a few of whom dabbled in art dealing), outside employment 
(particularly on the team that made the Disney movie "Fantasia"), political 
pressures from the far right, personal interests in Eastern philosophy and the 
quirks of a larger community that remained suspicious of serious culture. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the close-knit arts community of the '30s was Peter Krasnow, who 
drove to Glendale from New York City with his wife, Rose, in 1922. A gregarious 
man, he befriended the photographer Edward Weston, modernist architects Rudolph 
Schindler and Richard Neutra, Expressionist artists' representative Galka 
Scheyer and numerous painters, film directors and others. 
</P>
<P>
In Ehrlich's view, the strict horizontals and verticals in Krasnow's 
hot-colored abstract paintings can be compared to the framing elements of 
houses by his architect friends. 
</P>
<P>
Krasnow showed at the Stendhal Art Gallery on Wilshire Boulevard, which also 
handled work by such European artists as Klee and Kandinsky. But during the 
Great Depression, buyers were scarce, and in any case the knowledgeable art 
community was very small. So owner Erle Stendhal opened a candy store above the 
gallery where he sold chocolates made by his own plant in boxes decorated with 
reproductions of the art in his gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich said she came across a photograph of Stendhal's goodies and noticed a 
familiar-looking gold foil-wrapped chocolate object in the background. On 
closer observation it proved to be an edible copy of Krasnow's 1927 bronze 
sculpture, "Atlantis."

TRADITIONAL SOFA FURNISHES ARTIST WITH A CANVAS TO STRETCH OUT ON

<P>
Don Marble, general manager of Villa Hallmark Furniture in Anaheim, isn't 
really sure how it all came about. 
</P>
<P>
All he knows is that the company was looking for a showstopper for this 
weekend's Restaurant, Hotel, International Design Exposition Conference (RHIDEC 
for the short of breath) in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And he's a little fuzzy on how -- or why -- that led to internationally 
acclaimed artist Armando Alvarez, known for his monumental acrylic canvases 
celebrating the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't tell you how delighted I am it did," he says as he slowly, almost 
reverently, circles the result -- a traditional flaired-arm Chippendale sofa 
not so traditionally swathed in brilliant strokes of color. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Hallmark workers had stretched canvas over the frame and cushions and 
Alvarez had turned it into what he calls a three-dimensional "tangible abstract 
work of art." 
</P>
<P>
And it has to be seen to be appreciated -- or believed, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Love Seat 2000" is the name he gave it. The front represents our planetary 
system, complete with the Earth (a tennis ball that sits on one cushion) and 
the sun (a huge orange pillow that can be used as a footstool) in proper scale 
to the real orbs. 
</P>
<P>
The back of the love seat, says Alvarez, 51, "is the Tunnel of Time, into which 
we all disappear." 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy of life is in all my works," says the Mexican-born artist who 
now lives in San Diego. "My passion is saving our civilization from ourselves. 
We must work with nature and not against it. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the environmental movement talk about 'saving the Earth.' That's 
nonsense. We can't kill Earth any more than we can kill the sun. We can kill 
ourselves, but the Earth will still be here. 
</P>
<P>
"The Earth does not belong to me; I belong to it. We brought nothing into it 
and we will take nothing out." 
</P>
<P>
"Love Seat 2000," which will be displayed at RHIDEC today through Monday at the 
Los Angeles Convention Center, is Alvarez's first three-dimensional piece, but 
he says it won't be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea that people can feel and touch and even sit on or lie down on 
one of my works. There's something intensely personal about that." 
</P>
<P>
His dream, he says, is to paint a building. Not in the conventional sense, of 
course. "I want to find an innovative developer who will just turn over a 10- 
or 15-story building to me that I can turn into a giant work of art -- one that 
can be seen and photographed from a space satellite and seen from every 
airplane that passes over," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Until that happens, those interested in viewing his works must visit museums or 
garner invitations from private collectors around the world (in Orange County, 
five of his paintings are displayed in the lobby of the Beckman Laser Institute 
at UC Irvine). 
</P>
<P>
Some of his works will be seen in upcoming issues of Sports Illustrated and 
Cosmopolitan magazines, interestingly enough, in features not on him but on his 
wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Alvarez, 47, a clinical psychologist who specializes in working with 
athletes and herself a champion triathlete, recently shattered the record for 
the grueling 146-mile race from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mt. 
Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
In many triathlons and marathons, she competes with her twin sister, Angelika 
Casteneda, and it is their astonishing feats that attracted the attention of 
the major national magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Sports Illustrated writer and photographer came to interview her, 
their attention was also drawn to her husband's artworks, both finished and 
unfinished, at their home, so the decision was made to include the paintings as 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Alvarez's training was in music, not art. He was born to an influential 
Mexican family (his uncle is former President Luis Alvarez Echeverrea) and 
studied piano at the Conservatorio Nacional de Musica in Mexico City and became 
an accomplished concert pianist. He was accepted for further study at Juilliard 
in New York, but declined, "because I was not being creatively fulfilled by 
music." 
</P>
<P>
He began dabbling in art, and his works came to the attention of famed Mexican 
artists Francisco Corzas and Rudolfo Nieto, both of whom hailed him as a 
genius. Remarkably, they insisted he not seek training in art because, as 
Corzas said, "formal schooling could destroy his untamed spirit on canvas." 
</P>
<P>
One art critic, Alen Hollander of Horizon magazine, described Alvarez's works 
as "prayers in paint." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Hallmark's Marble is not quite sure what the company -- which produces 
furniture for hotels and restaurants -- will do with "Love Seat 2000" when the 
RHIDEC show ends Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We may just keep it at our showroom or we could auction it off. For now, 
though, we're just going to enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
And protect it. He said the work has been insured for $25,000.

BUYING PIANO: REMEMBER, IT IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By PATRICK MOTT

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not going to do any good, but I'm going to say it anyway because it'll 
make me feel like my duty has been done: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't buy a piano because you need something big to stick in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Get a meat locker. Get a Franklin stove. Get a TV the size of Geraldo Rivera's 
ego. But if you're not going to play the thing, and if all you really want is 
something pretty to dust, don't, don't, don't get a piano. 
</P>
<P>
OK, I've served art. Now, on to commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say your kid is pestering you for piano lessons, or you don't think you 
can stand another year of life on this mortal coil without learning how to play 
"Great Balls of Fire" just like Jerry Lee, or you really, actually, truly know 
how to play the Chopin "Black Key" etude. Let's say, in other words, that as a 
potential piano owner, you're legit. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the first thing you should consider, then, is the fact that a piano 
isn't a car. You're not going to buy it this year and trade it in the next when 
a slicker model comes along (ideally, anyway). A piano, said Gary Goldman, the 
secretary-treasurer of Field's Pianos and Organs in Garden Grove, is an item 
you buy for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally," he said, "it's a lifetime investment. It's something you might have 
around for your kids someday. So it's a good idea to invest in the best you can 
possibly afford." 
</P>
<P>
New pianos of "lesser quality," he said, start at about $2,000 and go up from 
there to about $5,000. Generally, these are spinets, a type of piano with short 
strings and a short sounding board that stand next to a wall. In ascending 
order of height, console, studio and upright pianos are similar to a spinet, 
but their longer strings and sounding boards make them taller and give them a 
more substantial tone quality. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest thing to an economic rule of thumb in the world of pianos probably 
is this: Bigger is usually better and therefore more expensive. A 9-foot 
concert grand piano, for instance, makes that spinet in your den sound like a 
windup toy. That huge sounding board and those long, long strings produce 
clarity, brilliance and depth, and, when you start getting into the notes below 
the bass clef staff, the air in the room absolutely pulsates. Pros play them. 
</P>
<P>
And they pay for them. The best of them cost tens of thousands of dollars. 
However, if you want a moderate-quality, 4-foot baby grand, you can find one 
that won't get you out of four figures. And parlor grands, usually measuring 
from 5 to 6 feet in length, usually start at about $10,000 and top out at about 
$25,000. David Ida, the sales manager at Colton Piano and Organ in Santa Ana, 
said the parlor grand is the most popular size among buyers who have decided 
that a vertical piano just won't do. 
</P>
<P>
(Electric pianos, which now reproduce actual piano sounds without the familiar 
electronic residue through the use of digital technology, fill the smallest 
space of all, and a good one can be had for about $5,000.) 
</P>
<P>
A second consideration is more personal: action. In the most general sense, the 
action of a piano is simply the way the key and hammer mechanisms work. For 
players, however, it is the incredibly delicate link between their bodies and 
the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what transforms our touch into music," Goldman said. "And it's kind of 
personal as to what (touch) each person wants to feel." 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, only one way to find out what sort of action suits you, 
and that is to play a lot of pianos. If you're a novice and are studying with a 
teacher, bring him or her along for an informed second opinion. The salesperson 
can offer suggestions, too. Ultimately, however, it's you who must live with 
the touch of those keys day after day. So don't rush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looks Don't Count 
</P>
<P>
You also have to live with the physical looks of the instrument. But please 
don't let that be your principal reason for buying it. You can find instruments 
of various sizes and lengths that are woodworkers' fantasies. You can find 
Plexiglas lids, high-gloss finishes, velvet finishes, antique white finishes, 
woods of nearly every color, filigree, fluting, inlaid trademarks in Gothic 
brass lettering, carvings that would make a Corinthian column look bland. 
Hardly any of it makes one jot of difference in how the piano sounds. 
</P>

"The average person going out to buy a piano for the first time unfortunately 
doesn't know much about it," Goldman said. "So the first thing that catches 
their eye is the cabinet. Some people will try to sell you the cabinet more 
than the inner workings. They'll build a cabinet and put a piano inside of it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the piano that looks like a Faberge egg sometimes doesn't get the 
biggest gee whiz. You want real physical drama? Check out the Bosendorfer 
Imperial concert grand. Made in Austria, it's a behemoth 9 feet, 6 inches long 
and has eight extra keys tacked onto the left-hand end of the keyboard for 
augmented bass notes. It costs about $85,000. Now that's a piano. 
</P>
<P>
So let's say you buy it. And in a couple of days, there in the middle of the 
room (assuming you can get it through the door) sits the piano of your dreams, 
lid raised, gleaming, inviting, absolutely pregnant with musical possibilities, 
a button-tufted, leather-upholstered bench begging you to settle into it and 
start hammering out Czerny. Just you and your King Kong Bosendorfer, forever. 
</P>
<P>
And your piano tuner. If you want to continue to make beautiful music together, 
your piano is going to need to be tuned periodically. Goldman estimated that in 
the more forgiving climate of Southern California, a tuning every six to nine 
months should do it if you want to maintain optimum tone. Tuners, he said, 
charge between $50 and $80. Pianos also can be "voiced" -- the tone made 
brighter or more mellow -- at the player's request. 
</P>
<P>
Also, pianos don't travel well. At least, they don't hold a tune after being 
transported. And the transporting also involves a bit of expense: between about 
$50 and $80 to move one a distance up to around 30 miles, said Goldman, 
assuming there are no stairs involved. That costs extra. 
</P>
<P>
My advice to anyone wrestling with the decision over whether to buy a piano is 
to succumb. Immediately. From what I can tell, buyer's remorse among piano 
owners is rare, and the rewards are huge. You'll find yourself being constantly 
drawn to the bench in your wanderings around the house. The musical challenges 
are endless, and playing is a natural tranquilizer. You can lose yourself at 
the piano. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, it is a thing of beauty, even if it's just sitting there silently. But 
if that's all it does in your house, you're better off turning your living room 
into a mushroom farm. To justify its existence, it must be played, and often. 
</P>
<P>
A piano, after all, is about the only piece of furniture you can buy that comes 
with a moral obligation attached.

NEW INTERACTIVE VIDEO DISC LETS VIEWERS RUN THE SHOW 
</P>

<P>
The future is here. It's called interactive video, and it's an innovative 
application of laser-disc technology that allows viewers to get inside films, 
art and news events as never before. 
</P>
<P>
According to the current issue of Video Magazine, this video innovation may 
mean an end to people passively absorbing programming. 
</P>
<P>
Interactivity means that viewers have choices -- they can continue watching 
what passes before them or they can leave the narration and delve into material 
that interests them. This is possible on laser discs because they offer access 
to each frame of video, which makes it easy to move to any point on the disc. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a disc that catalogues the works of a famous painter presents the 
works one by one. But at the touch of a button, the viewer can call up 
additional information about the painting, the artist's life or his work. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the laserdiscs from Voyager Co., a Santa Monica firm, feature 
commentary from filmmakers and film historians on one of the extra audio 
channels and multimedia essays that blend still pictures and text with 
full-motion video. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager has many titles in its collection, from "Lawrence of Arabia" to "Blade 
Runner," and is planning upcoming releases such as "Raging Bull" and "The Last 
Picture Show." Other discs explore news events, such as last year's San 
Francisco earthquake, and academic subjects, including biology. 
</P>
<P>
The company also blends education and entertainment in its new compact disc 
Companion series, which run on Macintosh computers. The first of these was the 
"Beethoven Symphony No. 9 CD Companion," a five-part exploration of the 
composer's masterpiece. It includes insights into the composer's world, a 
tutorial on the building blocks of music and commentary on the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies, such as Warner News Media and ABC News Interactive, are 
contributing to the field of interactive video.

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S VISIONS ENJOY NEW SURGE IN POPULARITY; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: THE FAMED ARCHITECT'S WORK IS SHOWING UP IN BUILDINGS, JEWELRY, 
FURNITURE, T-SHIRTS AND NOTEPAPER AND COMMANDING HIGH PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Lloyd Wright liked to furnish the homes he built, thus assuring that 
nothing in his carefully executed designs was left to chance. 
</P>
<P>
While the architect's works were reviled by many during his lifetime, they are 
enjoying an unprecedented revival more than 30 years after his death. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists are flocking to the public buildings and private residences he built, 
and the seemingly countless items of furniture and home accessories attributed 
to him continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Although you couldn't give away his furniture for years, copies now 
manufactured in Italy and marketed in the United States by Atelier 
International sell at prices into five figures. Tiffany &amp; Co. does a 
thriving business in reproductions of crystal, silver and china. Schumacher has 
introduced Frank Lloyd Wright fabric, wall coverings and rugs, and 
Oakbrook-Esser Studios of Oconomowoc, Wis., fabricates art glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Wright's own works, his influence on others seems to be growing. There 
are 40 books on Wright in print, says Richard Carney, managing trustee of the 
Frank Lloyd Wright Trust of Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a tremendous number of designs that are either influenced by or copied 
from Mr. Wright," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the copies are faithful reproductions, but one might wonder what Wright 
himself would think of an avalanche of other items, such as notepaper, T-shirts 
and jewelry identified with the Wright name, which are sold via mail order and 
at Wright museums. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the product offerings, Wright buildings are being restored and museums 
are scurrying to stage retrospectives. David Hanks of New York, a museum 
curator, has organized several exhibitions, including one which will open at 
the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va., in November. The Museum of Modern Art in 
New York has announced plans for a major retrospective in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices for original furnishings escalate in antiques shops and 
auction houses. 
</P>
<P>
After a prolific career that spanned 70 years, is it possible that Wright's 
influence and his designs are more widely dispersed 31 years after his death? 
</P>
<P>
"I think so," says Carney. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hanks, Wright believed a home should offer a feeling of repose, 
and that indoor and outdoor environments should be in harmony. These thoughts 
and his love for Japanese art and natural wood -- he often used beautifully 
grained wood such as oak -- are much appreciated today, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Atelier distributes reproductions of Wright's best-known furniture, such as the 
Barrel Chair and Robie and Taliesin chairs. Prices range from $1,200 for a side 
chair to $14,000 for a large dining table. That may seem pricey, but not 
contrasted with the $1.6 million recently paid for an original dining set. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the "Imperial" china, Tiffany offers the more informal "Cabaret" 
pattern. Also in its Frank Lloyd Wright collection are a terra cotta vase and 
crystal vases, candlesticks and a candy dish. Prices range from about $100 to 
$300. This fall, Tiffany's is introducing some sterling silver accessories. 
</P>
<P>
These companies, along with Schumacher and Oakbrook-Esser, are licensed by the 
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Since the licensing program began in 1986, the 
number of products has grown substantially, according to Steve Kroeter, who 
oversees all licensing applications. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with seven pieces of furniture," says Kroeter. "Now there are 13. 
And over the next five years there will be two more collections, each with 
three to six pieces. More rugs have been introduced, and two new windows will 
be added this fall." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to browse through the home furnishings reproductions, an 
updated product catalogue will be available in September for $8.50 from the 
Frank Lloyd Wright Catalogue, P.O. Box 5599, Stacy, Minn., 55079.

AUTO BODY FILLER WORKS ON CRACKS, HOLES IN WOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.J. HAND, Distributed by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years I've been pushing polyester auto body filler as one of the best 
materials there is for filling holes, dents, cracks and gouges in wood. 
Reasons? It's easy to apply. It sets up in a matter of minutes, never shrinks 
or cracks no matter how large the repair, it sands easily and finishes very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Its only real drawback? Depending upon the brand you buy, it usually comes out 
a gray or dirty grayish pink. That's not exactly the shade you'd look for if 
you want a good wood-tone color match under a clear finish. For this reason, I 
normally use the stuff only when I plan to subsequently cover it up, with 
either a couple coats of paint or perhaps some plastic laminate. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, however, Minwax came out with a product called High Performance 
Wood Filler. Like polyester auto body filler, it comes in two parts: a can of 
putty and a tube of hardener. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as I saw it on the hardware store shelf, I surreptitiously popped open 
the can and took a look. A quick sniff revealed the telltale odor of polyester. 
The color was, if not a perfect wood-tone, at least in the neighborhood. I'd 
call it a warm, brownish gray. Not only that, according to the label, this 
stuff could be stained! Although it cost about three times as much as auto body 
filler, it sounded good. I decided to buy a can and compare it to my old 
standby. 
</P>
<P>
I quickly discovered that it handles just like auto body filler. As with auto 
body filler, the goo in the can is composed of a liquid resin combined with 
powdered fillers to create a puttylike material. As with body filler, the two 
components tend to separate with storage so it pays to stir the can before use. 
</P>
<P>
After stirring, scoop out a blob big enough to handle the job you have in mind, 
and mix it with a bit of the hardener from the separate squeeze tube. Body 
fillers usually come with a rusty red hardener. This makes it easy to see when 
you've done a good job of mixing, but it also gives you that dirty pink color 
mentioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The hardener with the Minwax filler is basically colorless. This makes it a bit 
harder to judge how well you've mixed your putty, but it also avoids that 
sickly grayish pink. 
</P>
<P>
Once either product is mixed with its hardener, you should apply it without 
delay. Depending upon how much hardener you've used, and the ambient 
temperature, the mix may set up pretty quickly. Use a flexible putty knife and 
hold it at a low angle. This helps force the putty into the defect you are 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
Since neither product shrinks, there's no need to overfill as you must with 
many other products. Just smooth the filler on and level. Avoid holding the 
knife at a steep angle, however. This tends to drag the filler out of the 
defect and you won't get a level coverage. 
</P>
<P>
On with the tests. Once my samples were mixed, I applied them to shallow 
one-inch holes drilled into ordinary pine. Ten minutes later, when the samples 
had set up, I tried staining them. According to the Minwax directions, you 
should sand the filler lightly with 100-grit paper (finer paper closes the 
pores of the filler so it takes less stain) and apply your stain while the 
filler is freshly cured. You should then let the stain penetrate for an hour 
before wiping off the excess. I followed those directions on the Minwax filler, 
using a Minwax stain. And while I was at it, I tried the same procedure on my 
grayish pink auto body filler samples. 
</P>
<P>
Results? To my surprise, once the stain was on, there wasn't much difference in 
color between the two products. The auto body filler was just a tad pinker than 
the Minwax filler, but to be honest, neither was really a very good match for 
the color of the stained pine surrounding the test patches. 
</P>
<P>
Of course you will probably get different results with different stains and 
different woods, but my initial reaction is that neither body filler nor the 
Minwax wood filler is a good choice if you want an accurate color match under a 
clear finish. For accurate color matching, you'll probably get a better job 
with stick shellac, or a product such as Plastic Wood, especially if you take 
the time to blend two or more colors together to get the exact shade you like. 
</P>
<P>
But for filling under paints or laminates, for repairing plaster and wallboard, 
for anchoring screws, and working indoor or out, polyester fillers are still my 
first choice. And given its clear-cut price advantage, I'll stick with ordinary 
auto body filler, stuff with names such as Bondo, White Lightning or Black 
Knight.

PROBLEMS IN WALLS? BEST ANSWER MAY BE TO BUILD NEW ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAROL V. MENZIE and RANDY JOHNSON, Distributed by the Los Angeles 
Times-Washington Post News Service. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Walls are the biggest surface in your house, and often they present the biggest 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The worse condition they are in, the better off you may be. It won't be hard to 
sacrifice them to heating ducts, plumbing pipes and electrical wires. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if they are plastered and range from pretty good to 
decrepit, you will have to decide how to treat every single surface. 
</P>
<P>
If you are an ardent preservationist, or your house has historic status that 
requires it, you will want to save them all. Or replace them exactly as they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
If you are only semiardent -- say, one foot in the 19th Century and one in the 
21st -- you'll want to keep what's practical and replace the rest with 
something aesthetically complementary. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the walls are too far gone to save, the room may have elaborate 
molding, woodwork or wainscoting that is worth preserving. 
</P>
<P>
"Aesthetically complementary" is the operative term here. While we fall into 
the semiardent category, we are fairly rigid about the wall treatments we 
consider appropriate for an older house: Plaster, drywall and, in some cases, 
exposed brick. 
</P>
<P>
We have seen -- and loved -- old houses where a carefully restored exterior 
contains a starkly modern interior. For us, the point is to preserve livable 
housing stock and keep special neighborhoods identifiable, not to return to the 
days of buggy whips and wood-fired cookstoves. The best of the old works very 
well with the best of the new if the applications are consistent and the 
treatments are in keeping with the style of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Drywall is simply the modern equivalent of plaster. If Colonial and Victorian 
builders had had it, they would have used it. It is extremely versatile, 
inexpensive, quick to install, easy to insulate, somewhat fire-retardant, and 
lends itself to any surface treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Almost anyplace plaster has been, drywall can go. However, drywall has to be 
finished well -- with invisible seams and no nails popping out -- or it can be 
ugly, and no amount of paint will cover the flaws (though wallpaper, an 
appropriately old-fashioned treatment, can cover a multitude of such sins). 
</P>
<P>
Plaster, if it's in good condition, offers a beautifully smooth surface, and 
it's somewhat soundproof, but it's not inherently superior. If you're trying to 
add something to a plaster surface -- molding, woodwork, or just a simple 
picture hanger -- plaster is a very unforgiving surface. It cracks, flakes and 
pits. 
</P>
<P>
Old plaster is subject to a host of ills. The older it is, the more likely it 
is to have lost its "keys" -- the blobs of plaster that leak through the gaps 
in the lath and hold the plaster to the wood when it dries. Over time, the keys 
break off and leave the plaster loose. There are special washers that can be 
used to reattach the plaster. (We've never used them, but the Old House Journal 
recommends them.) If a plaster ceiling is loose, you might want to think twice 
about trying to repair it. 
</P>
<P>
Plaster that's installed over masonry seems to hang on better and may be easier 
to repair. (Some more modern plaster, installed over a perforated gypsum base, 
also tends to age more gracefully.) 
</P>
<P>
Plaster will also fail if it becomes saturated with water and is not allowed to 
dry out, or if a structural element behind it -- like a ceiling joist or wall 
stud -- shifts, breaks or splits. Such underlying problems have to be fixed 
first, and if they've caused major plaster damage, repairs are probably best 
left to a professional. (Complicated ornamental plaster repairs should 
definitely be left to an artisan.) 
</P>
<P>
However, sometimes only the plaster surface is damaged. An amateur can learn to 
fill small cracks, nicks, scrapes and holes. It just takes patience -- though 
it helps if you're something of a perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly deeper cracks and holes can be scraped out, saturated with water and 
filled with one or more coats of plaster mix. (A series of shallow coats that 
dry quickly will give the best bond.) Shallow surface damage, roughness or 
small holes can be "skimmed over" with a coat of joint compound and sanded 
smooth. 
</P>
<P>
If you're good at it, you can cover cracks with drywall tape, finish them with 
joint compound and sand them smooth. 
</P>
<P>
If you're serious about saving a lot of walls, the more work you do yourself, 
the more cost-efficient the task will be. You won't save much money keeping 
marginal plaster walls, especially if you have to pay a professional an hourly 
rate to repair them. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of rehabbers want to get rid of old plaster to expose old brick beneath. 
There's something comforting and appealing about the color and texture of old 
brick walls, but such walls are not trouble-free. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was never meant to show, old pointing is likely to be ugly or 
inadequate. Nearly all exposed brick needs repointing. Also, since the wall 
behind was not meant to show, the plaster may cover some pretty ugly things: 
big cracks, mismatched bricks, crooked courses, broken-out gaps where gas pipes 
used to run. 
</P>
<P>
If you've never lived with exposed brick, you may not be aware that it sheds -- 
a fine red dust that coats the baseboards and anything else that's up against 
the wall. There are a number of coatings that can be applied to stop the dust 
problem, but nearly all change the appearance of the brick. Even coated brick 
may be hard to keep clean and any electrical service will have to run across 
the surface through wire molding. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind also that exposed brick isn't weathertight or very soundproof.

SCHUUR STEP AWAY FROM THE SHADOWS; 
</P>
<P>
VOCALIST: THE JAZZ SINGER, WHO HASN'T RELEASED AN ALBUM SINCE 1988, WILL BE 
MORE THAN 100 POUNDS LIGHTER AND EMOTIONALLY CLEARER AT THE COACH HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
What a difference a year or two can make. Diane Schuur hasn't released an album 
since 1988, but she has used the free time to create a brand new image. When 
the Washington state-based jazz singer appears at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano tonight, she will look svelte and slim -- more than 100 pounds 
lighter than she was two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a mere shadow of former self," she joked earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
But the changes reach well beyond her new silhouette. She has also spent the 
last two years trying to bring order to her professional and personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
The long hiatus from recording resulted from a nasty dispute with GRP Records 
over the duration of her contract and the quality of promotion for her albums. 
It dragged on until GRP's recent acquisition by MCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
A new album is scheduled for release early next year. "It takes a new slant for 
me," Schuur says. "I wanted to spread my wings beyond the jazz genre. Not that 
there's anything wrong with jazz, but I wanted to add some R&amp;B and some 
ballads. I love like 'What a Difference a Day Makes' and 'Unforgettable.' We 
were lucky enough to get Andre Fischer -- Natalie Cole's husband -- to produce 
it, and he was excellent, one of the best producers I've had, just full of 
enthusiasm and energy. Just great to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Schuur has also begun to exorcise some demons that confronted her during her 
rapid rise from Seattle nightclubs to command performances at the White House. 
The star-making machinery, and Schuur's reaction to it, had unhealthy 
consequences for the blind singer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a 12-step program now," she says, "and it's one of the best things 
that's ever happened to me. I know I'm a compulsive person, and I have to be 
careful that I don't go from one extreme to another. I shouldn't overeat, but 
then I shouldn't under-eat, either, because that's as much a form of compulsive 
acting-out as overeating is." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, she says, the program has helped her deal with a tendency to 
beat up on herself: "It's always been much easier for me to say, 'Oh, well, you 
were a bad girl; you screwed up again.' I'm trying to get myself out of that 
way of thinking, and it's had a real positive effect in many parts of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Schuur's audiences have begun to see and hear some of the tangible 
consequences. She is more open, more communicative and, clearly, more self 
confident. And her singing has become enriched. An often-criticized tendency 
toward shrillness in her upper register has been replaced by a warmer, more 
centered sound. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a reason for my singing that way," she says. "I was carrying around 
so much weight -- physical weight, emotional weight -- that it was hard to 
project. So I pushed too hard and did the best I could with what I had. Now I'm 
lighter, in a lot of ways. I've still got the power, but now it feels as though 
it's harnessed. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think that what I'm doing is finally allowing the vulnerability of 
the little child inside me to come out. And that feels really good."

When Chuck Stearns won the Catalina water-ski race for the first time, it was 
1955 and he was 16. He was called Chucky then and was the youngest winner in 
the race's history. 
</P>
<P>
When Stearns won the same across-the-channel-and-back race in 1982, it was his 
11th victory, and no one else has won it more than three times. At 44, he was 
the oldest winner. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns, 52 and as muscular and optimistic as ever, will be in this year's 42nd 
annual Catalina race, which starts Sunday at 8 a.m. from Long Beach Harbor. It 
will be his first attempt since his retirement, after the 1985 race when he 
finished eighth overall. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get calm water, we've got a chance at the overall," Stearns said he as 
he watched his wife, Mary, paint the number 811 on the sides of the white boat 
that will pull Stearns the 62 miles from Long Beach to Avalon and back. The 
numbers, in keeping with Stearns' trademark swim suit, are polka-dotted. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably be the smallest boat in the race, so we need a break in the 
water to have a chance against the big guys, but we're ready," Stearns 
continued. His tow will be from a 16-foot boat owned and driven by Kenny 
Colombero, a former barefoot water-skier from Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"I won my first race in back of a 16-foot Gold Digger that Bob Reem was 
driving, but that was 35 years ago and an 18-foot runabout was considered a big 
boat then. Now, most of the fast guys have around 32-footers. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure we can make it over and back in an hour, maybe an hour and five 
minutes. Then we'll have to see how we make out." 
</P>
<P>
The record is 54 minutes 56 seconds, set by Mason Thompson in calm waters in 
1987 with Vic Edelbrock driving his Scarab. Thompson bettered Stearns' record 
as the youngest winner three years earlier when he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Schoen of Mesa, Ariz., won last year's race in 1:00:47, with a tow from 
off-road racing driver Tim Herbst of Las Vegas. It was Schoen's third victory. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 teams from seven countries will take off together Sunday in a 
mass start to what is universally considered the premier water-ski race in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
When Steve Moore of England won the world championship in Australia, he said 
his biggest thrill was winning the Catalina race in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Catalina is the one race everybody shoots for," said Edelbrock, who is also a 
noted speed accessories manufacturer. "One year, I won three out of four races 
on the same program at Clear Lake, but even that didn't beat winning Catalina. 
It's the ultimate." 
</P>
<P>
If Catalina is the ultimate race, then Stearns is its ultimate competitor. 
</P>
<P>
He was a student at Bellflower High School when he won in 1955 and '56. Then he 
won three races in a row in 1958-59-60 while earning a degree in mechanical 
engineering at Long Beach State, and followed with victories in 1962, '65, '71, 
'75 and '79. In 1982, Stearns was named one of seven charter members of the 
Water Ski Hall of Fame at Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought I was retired, so they made a beautiful plaque with my 10 
Catalina wins on it, and then I came back three months later and won it again 
and screwed up their plaque," Stearns said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns pioneered use of the single ski when he won in 1955, and all winners 
since have used one ski. In the original Catalina race, from Avalon to Redondo 
Beach in 1935, competitors rode aquaplanes, huge "ironing boards" that were 
phased out after World War II when skis became popular. Harry Laughenhouse, a 
two-time winner, was the last Catalina champion to wear two skis. 
</P>
<P>
"One ski makes a difference in cutting down drag, and it is also easier to 
recover when you lose your balance backward or forward," Stearns said. "In 
rough water, it is much easier to handle one ski rather than two." 
</P>
<P>
Stearns also set a world record of 122.11 m.p.h. in 1969 at Long Beach Marine 
Stadium and won numerous world and national ski championships in slalom, trick 
and jumping. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Stearns' memorable Catalina races are not among his victories. Both 
involved his father, Bill, a general contractor who loved the water and 
instilled skiing in his son. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, Chucky made his first try in the channel race and was leading when his 
dad, riding as an observer, was bounced out of the boat. By the time they 
stopped and got him back aboard, Stearns had lost several minutes. He finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Each contestant has an observer, who sits facing the skier and acts as a 
communication center between the driver and the skier. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want the driver to slow down, I jab him once in the ribs, and if I want 
him to speed up, I jab him twice," said Mary Stearns, who has been her 
husband's observer for two victories. "We have other ways to communicate 
information, but basically an observer's toughest job is holding on when the 
boat starts bouncing around in the wakes and swells." 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, Chuck's brother was the observer and his father the driver 
during a tense duel with longtime rival Butch Peterson, a three-time winner 
from South Pasadena, when both boats missed Catalina in the fog and continued 
out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to miss than you might think," Stearns said in recalling the 
incident. "Avalon sits at the tip of the island and if it's foggy, and you're 
the least bit to the left, you'll miss it. It was so foggy that day, we 
couldn't see a thing, but the water was real calm so we were still running 
about 50 (m.p.h.). 
</P>
<P>
"Three of us were running close together and we all ended up on San Clemente 
Island. If we'd missed that one, the next island would have been Hawaii. I'm 
surprised we even made it to San Clemente without running out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
"Butch and I pooled what was left of our gas and gave it to the other guy, and 
sent him back to Catalina to report where we were. We sat around eating raw 
clams and abalone, but we also saw a bunch of gun shells lying around, and that 
made us nervous, especially when we saw a sign that said, 'Prohibited Area.' 
San Clemente, we found out, was a (naval) gunnery target. 
</P>
<P>
"It must have been around midnight when we thought we heard something, so we 
lit a fire and it got out of hand, and before we knew it, it looked like the 
whole island was on fire. It turned out, what we'd heard was the Coast Guard 
looking for us, and when the island lit up, it wasn't hard for them to find 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Stearns drove in five races that his son won, making him the winningest 
driver in the Catalina record book. 
</P>
<P>
With 100 skiers coming up out of the water together, the start looks like a 
fish feeding frenzy with water being churned as the boats fight for position 
heading out the narrow Queen's Gate breakwater opening to the channel. 
</P>
<P>
It makes racing easier to get off among the leaders, but both Stearns and 
Schoen have proved it's not totally necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the engine misfired on Stearns' boat, and before driver Burt Court 
could get it restarted, the other skiers were gone and the water was choppy 
from their wakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost at least five minutes at the start and then we had to go through some 
really rough water for about five miles," Stearns said. "We were 13th through 
the island, but we managed to get back to Long Beach in front." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Schoen was still sitting on the deck of Herbst's 38-foot Mr. 
Terrible when the flare went off, signaling the start of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting there, waiting for the start boat to come by before I got in the 
water, but I guess we missed it," Schoen remembered. "Tim Herbst pushed me off 
and started taking out rope. The rope got a big knot in it and we lost about 20 
feet of rope because there was no time to stop. It turned out to be a blessing 
because the water was rough, and the shorter rope put me in a better wake of 
the boat and we won." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Stearns will face a formidable field that includes three-time defending 
champion Schoen, world champion Ian Pickle of England, former world champion 
Moore and Gary Tomlin of Long Beach, who was leading toward the end of last 
year's race when he fell after hitting a wake from a spectator boat. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Johnson of Oakley, Calif., winner of the last three women's championships, 
is back and favored to make it four in a row. She set the women's record of 1 
hour 2 minutes 59 seconds in 1987.

PIERCE, 15, FACES A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Born in Canada, reared in Florida and living in France, 15-year-old Mary Pierce 
holds three passports, a No. 136 ranking and a great deal of promise. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy for someone so young to become part of the news, except for those 
who make a big splash in tournaments, as did 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati and 
16-year-old Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Pierce is best known for what she has left: the U.S. Tennis Assn., Nick 
Bollettieri's Tennis Academy, Harry Hopman's camp, Florida, America and the 
lasting impression that her father, who is also her coach, might be the most 
overbearing tennis parent of all. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pierce, 54, picked up and moved his family to his wife's native France 
after a row with the USTA over financial and coaching support for his daughter. 
In a recent Sports Illustrated article, the elder Pierce acknowledged, among 
other things, to once yelling during a match, "Mary, kill the bitch." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce, who said she has not read the story, is loyal to her father. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't do anything to hurt me or anything like that," Pierce said. "He's 
on the court trying to get the best out of me. I don't see anything wrong with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what her father does, Pierce said: "Nothing, he watches me." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Pierce travels with his daughter as she struggles to break in on the 
pro tour. Coming into next week's Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at Manhattan 
Country Club, Pierce has won $23,920 this year and $31,958 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Capriati, who signed endorsements worth $5 million, Pierce has no 
endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is still highly regarded as a potential star. At 5-feet-10 and 120 
pounds, she plays an aggressive baseline game designed to put pressure on her 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it was difficult to know for sure who Pierce's opponent might 
be. Before the French Open, Pierce announced that she wanted to represent 
France, rejecting the USTA. She played in the Federation Cup for France two 
weeks ago in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's task will be to try to be equal to her buildup while riding out a 
semi-controversial start. She said she can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I don't feel any pressure," Pierce said. "When I go on the court, I'm 
having fun. So I don't worry about it."

ORIOLES' 6-7 MCDONALD SPEAKS SOFTLY, CARRIES A BIG PITCH

<P>
The Baltimore Orioles spent 12 weeks last year negotiating with pitcher Ben 
McDonald, the team's No. 1 pick in the free-agent draft. He eventually signed a 
three-year contract worth $925,000, which could reach $1.15 million with 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as it turns out, the Orioles might have gotten the better of that deal. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7 right-hander has been tearing up the American League with a 
95-m.p.h. fastball and a wicked breaking pitch, setting club records and giving 
the Orioles a fresh arm in time for the title race. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonald is not just a rookie, he is an exception," Oriole Manager Frank 
Robinson said. "He has outstanding stuff and because of that, he is an 
outstanding rookie. . . . very poised, he stays within himself and knows what 
he can do and what he can't do." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon against the Oakland Athletics, he had a one-hitter before 
giving up three hits and a run in the sixth inning. Even so, McDonald won his 
fourth consecutive start and the fifth consecutive decision of his career, 
setting one club record and tying another. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably comparable to (Roger) Clemens," said Jose Canseco of the 
Athletics. "He's not afraid to pitch inside and for a young kid, he throws very 
well . . . real hard, and around the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Said the A's Carney Lansford: "He's tough. He's one of those guys with the kind 
of stuff that if he avoids injuries, he's going to be around for a lot of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
After signing with the Orioles last August, McDonald was sent to the Orioles' 
Class-A minor league team in Frederick, Md., for two appearances, then was 
called back to the majors in September, when he got his first professional 
victory, 7-5 over the Toronto Blue Jays in relief on the last day of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
That capped the biggest turnaround in the Orioles' history. They finished 
second in the American League East after going 54-107 in 1988, when they 
finished 34 1/2 games behind in last place. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald made the team in spring training this season, but in April pulled the 
muscle that connects the ribs to the pelvis on his left side. He was put on the 
15-day disabled list, then underwent rehabilitation at the club's double-A 
affiliate in Hagerstown, Md., and later at the triple-A club in Rochester, 
N.Y.. But by July, he had recovered and was recalled. In his first start, at 
Baltimore on July 21, he shut out the Chicago White Sox on four hits, 2-0. That 
made him only the fourth Oriole to pitch a shutout in his first major league 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't compare him with anyone else," Oriole pitching coach Al Jackson said. 
"I think right now the best thing we can do for him, and for our organization, 
is to just give him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if McDonald is the kind of player a team builds its pitching staff 
around, Jackson said: "Eventually I think this probably will happen. At least I 
would hope so. . . . Ben's very aggressive . . . but in a quiet way." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, McDonald tied Jerry Walker's 1957-59 club record for most 
consecutive victories at the start of a career with five. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much is happening too fast to worry about records," McDonald said. "Maybe 
I'll reflect on that in the off-season. But when (the team) scores three or 
four runs for me early, that's going to make me that much better a pitcher. It 
relaxes me and it gives me confidence. And that makes me pitch better. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning to pitch to hitters I've never seen before. So I'm relying 
totally on my catcher (Bob Melvin) to know how they hit and to help me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald speaks softly, shying away from compliments and crediting teammates 
for much of his success. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been the most publicized guy in town this season and it just runs off his 
back like water on a duck," Jackson said. "You tell him what he has to do and 
he goes out and does it. He's just a great athlete." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald grew up about 12 miles from Baton Rouge, the site of Louisiana State 
University, where he was a two-time All-American. He went to LSU on a 
basketball scholarship but after two seasons decided to play baseball only. 
</P>
<P>
In his three-year career at LSU, he was 29-14 with six saves and 373 strikeouts 
in 308 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he helped the U.S. team win the gold medal with complete-game 
victories over Puerto Rico and South Korea in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
And the following year, he was voted the college baseball player of the year, 
leading LSU into the College World Series and earning the highest rating ever 
for a pitcher from major league baseball's scouting bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Said Terry Reynolds of the Dodgers' scouting office: "Ben has outstanding size 
and an outstanding arm. We saw him on more than one occasion before last year's 
draft and it would be safe to say, if he had been available, there would have 
been a definite interest. He just went too high." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles are in Anaheim this weekend for a series against the Angels but 
McDonald, who has a 1.43 ERA after 37 2/3 innings, is not expected to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said that his speedy rise to the majors revealed a few weaknesses in 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
"The hitters are much stronger and more consistent (in the big leagues)," 
McDonald said. "In double-A you saw hitters swinging at bad pitches. In the 
majors, they force you to pitch strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I need to be more consistent with my breaking ball and I need to 
develop my changeup and start throwing some of them to break it up a little. . 
. . I've only got three pitches, so I'm hoping to work on my forkball in the 
off-season and have that pitch next year." 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't talking baseball, McDonald likes to talk hunting and fishing in 
Louisiana, his voice betraying at least a bit of homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more in Louisiana rivers than ducks and fish. There are 
alligators, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, shoot, alligators are as common to the rivers in Louisiana as maybe dogs 
are around here," said McDonald, who has hunted and wrestled alligators. "So 
alligators are something I've been used to since I was a kid. It's not all that 
big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, bored while playing in the instructional league in Sarasota, Fla., 
McDonald got to thinking. 
</P>
<P>
He went into a swamp, caught an alligator, taped its mouth shut and put it in a 
teammate's bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out and screamed and ran into the parking lot and wouldn't come out 
until I went in and got it and took it out," McDonald said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Silly, huh?" 
</P>
