<TEXT>
<P>
I am enraged at Tony Serra's statement that people killed by drug overdoses and 
infants born addicted to drugs are expendable. 
</P>
<P>
Has this man no concern for human life? 
</P>
<P>
I am also appalled that such a self-righteous crusader for justice flouts the 
laws against drugs, deliberately does not pay parking tickets and for many 
years did not file a tax return. 
</P>
<P>
There are two words for people like Serra, and those words are criminal and 
hypocrite. Serra is just as bad as the people he rails against who hunted down 
and killed Indians like coyotes.

<TEXT>
<P>
I spent 15 years in the world of drugs, six of those years with drug smugglers 
and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
I watched my friends go from vital, creative human beings to zombies. I watched 
them get murdered, overdose, go to jail and destroy their families. 
</P>
<P>
Every time Tony Serra gets his drug clients off, he might as well hand them a 
shovel to dig their graves and the graves of the people they sell to. 
</P>
<P>
Last week another person I cared about died -- another person with a name, a 
face and loved ones. Maybe that's "small" to Tony Serra because it isn't 
happening to his family.

If we ever needed reaffirmation of the need for a speedy trial and speedier 
application of the death penalty in capital cases, we have an outstanding 
example in Croy vs. the People. I would venture a guess that the family of 
Officer Hittson, myself and many others don't think J. Tony Serra is very 
"cute."

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: WHEN YOU HEAR THE BEEP; 
</P>
<P>
MODERN TOOLS OF COMMUNICATION MAY SIGNAL THE END OF HUMAN CONVERSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOME TIME AGO a reader wrote that he was in a fast-food restaurant when it 
closed because the computer had broken down. None of the employees knew how to 
make change. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that actually happened, I don't know, but it is entirely possible. When 
you order a cheeseburger, a Diet Pepsi and fries, the counter person taps in 
the order on the computer, which not only sends the order directly to the 
kitchen but also makes the correct change, to the penny, and probably goes on 
to delete the items ordered from the inventory, so that the inventory is up to 
date at every second. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this technology makes the transaction faster, so why should the 
customer complain? Nevertheless, something is lost. There is no time for human 
contact. The counter person hardly has time to say, "Have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
He or she has had to make no calculations, has had to make no conversation. 
Like the customer, the counter person has become merely a function of the 
computers. In time, like the computer, he or she will be unable to laugh or 
cry. Whether computers can actually think remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I read, it has gone a step further. Instead of being labeled 
"CHEESEBURGER," the proper key has a picture of a cheeseburger, making it 
absolutely unnecessary for the counter person to know how to read. That is 
merely the penultimate step. No doubt soon the customer will be asked to speak 
his or her order into a microphone, and the computer will translate the sound. 
The counter person's only function then will be to move the completed order 
from the cook to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
If anything is said at all between customer and employee, it will be limited to 
"Thank you" and "Have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
I suppose computers are used in such situations to save money. The fewer 
calculations the employee has to make, the less money he or she will have to be 
paid, and the more customers can be served during a given amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Sriro, a dentist, summarizes his recent experience: "First, I was 
standing in line waiting for a clerk to ring up the sale on his megabyte 
computer, so that not only was the sale being recorded, but the entire store 
was probably being re-inventoried, a current profit-and-loss sheet updated and 
a cash-flow summary produced. All this while we stood around cooling our heels, 
wondering whatever happened to the 'grease pencil on the side of the brown 
paper bag' era. That technique was accurate and fast and, if nothing else, at 
least involved some continuous human mental and physical moves so that all 
concerned felt they were still a part of the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
There is no use wanting to go back to grease pencils and brown paper bags. The 
computer is here to stay. Strangely, though, in what is called the era of 
communication, communication is hand-led more and more by computers, and people 
are communicating less. 
</P>
<P>
We last remodeled our house at a time when use of the telephone-answering 
machine was becoming widespread. Throughout the remodeling ordeal, my 
contractor and I communicated almost entirely by answering machine. He would 
call me and get my answering machine, and I would call him and get his 
answering machine. One afternoon we actually managed to meet in person in my 
living room, and we spent the entire afternoon drinking beer and becoming quite 
incompetent. I think we were caught up in the emotional effect of actually 
talking in person. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the last straw is the computerized telephone pitch, where some real 
estate company calls you and gives you a computerized message. They don't even 
pay you the courtesy of spending a minute of human contact on you. I wouldn't 
respond to one of those messages if they offered me a free trip to the 
Caribbean, no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
I have rather adapted to the fax machine my wife bought me for Christmas. At 
first I was angry with her. It seemed too much money to spend for something I 
would never use. 
</P>
<P>
I must admit, though, that it has come in handy. Several times I have had The 
Times send me copies of articles I needed. I have received copies of documents 
I needed, thus saving two or three days' mailing time. Once, though, I received 
an ad from a fax company. How did it know my number? If my number gets out, I'm 
in real trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Then the other day I walked into my room to see about five yards of paper that 
had emerged from the machine and coiled in a mass on the floor. I scooped it up 
and scanned through it. It was a complete blank. Not a word. The little status 
window in the machine said "Paper empty." My worst fears were realized. It was 
like hearing from a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the age of communication or what?

OUTTAKES: TELLING IT LIKE IT WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I wince each time I say it," says filmmaker Stanley Kramer, referring to 
"Eleanor Roosevelt's Niggers" -- the name of the book that he plans to make 
into a movie. "But you have to understand, the men themselves used that term. 
And they didn't mean it in a derogatory sense." 
</P>
<P>
The title is a nickname for World War II's mostly black 761st tank battalion. 
It came into being largely because of the First Lady's campaign to allow blacks 
to serve in combat rather then being relegated to menial jobs. The men saw 
plenty of action, including the Battle of the Bulge, and their exploits were 
detailed in the 1976 book by battalion Capt. David J. Williams, who will be a 
consultant on the film. Joe Keaney -- who will co-produce -- says he has spent 
10 years trying to get it made. 
</P>
<P>
"I've run into every type of opposition," sighs Keaney, over issues ranging 
from the battalion's nickname to industry worries about the commercial chances 
of a black-themed project. 
</P>
<P>
Keaney ultimately teamed with Robert Guillaume's Longridge Prods. Then the 
project made its way to Kramer -- who's known for producing social-issue films 
ranging from "High Noon" (1950) to "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" (1967), as 
well as the 1949 title, "Home of the Brave," about abusive treatment of a black 
GI by his fellow white GI's. 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, too many things haven't changed since I made that movie," says Kramer. 
" 'Eleanor Roosevelt's Niggers' " -- which, with "E.R.N." is a possible title 
-- "is a World War II story, but, it really isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Keaney and Kramer, who will direct and produce, leave early next month to scout 
locations in Eastern Europe. Production is expected to begin early next year, 
with a $15-million budget. If his schedule permits, Guillaume (currently in the 
title role of the L.A. production of "Phantom of the Opera") will be among the 
stars. Bob Woodburn is writing the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Keaney has met with a representative of the Hollywood branch 
of the NAACP to garner approval for the project. "They're highly supportive -- 
they're familiar with the 761st," he says, stressing that he still plans to 
contact the NAACP national headquarters in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of sensitivities involved (including possible concerns over the 
film's projected title). We are determined to deal with them. But we also 
believe this story should be told. These guys were valiant Americans. If 
'Glory' could tell the story of black soldiers in the Civil War, can't the 
black soldiers during World War II get their due?" Pat H. Broeske

BALZER ON WINE: PRIZE GUENOC WINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WE OFTEN GET LETTERS and telephone calls from wine lovers trying to find wines 
that have been glowingly described in this column. They say they can't find 
them. But rest assured, these wines are out there. Here's some advice, from the 
late wine expert, Andre L. Simon, on how to make your hunt easier: 
</P>
<P>
"Choose a good wine merchant, the best you can find in your neighborhood. Share 
with him your likes and dislikes. As you become friends, he'll reward you with 
good finds to your taste. Reward him with your loyal patronage. Stay with him, 
until he disappoints you; then find another." 
</P>
<P>
Good wine merchants are rare these days, but even supermarkets have managers 
who appreciate loyal customers. The wine merchant or supermarket manager can 
order all the discoveries that I've written about. His store is your store. 
</P>
<P>
And now here's some news about wines from Guenoc, another small winery in 
California, once owned by Edwardian beauty Lillie Langtry, who produced claret 
on the 37-square-mile estate. After Prohibition, the Guenoc Valley property was 
used for cattle grazing -- until Orville Magoon, from Hawaii, came along in the 
early '70s and planted his first vines. From those plantings, gold medal wines 
are being produced. Trust engineer Magoon to have a vineyard where each vine is 
monitored by computer to register the soil's moisture and condition. Production 
has reached 83,000 cases annually. 
</P>
<P>
I'm particularly fond of the Guenoc Petit Sirah, and the 1987 edition ($9) of 
this wine is already garnering its share of recognition; the 1986 won three 
gold medals, plus a "Best of Class." The Guenoc 1986 Napa/ Lake Merlot ($12) 
and the 1985 Cabernet Sauvignon Premiere Cuvee ($17) took gold medals at the 
InterVin competition in Canada. The Tasters Guild in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 
recently gave its top gold to the 1988 Guenoc Valley Genevieve Magoon Vineyard 
Chardonnay Reserve ($20). 
</P>
<P>
When you find that Guenoc Petit Sirah, bake a batch of fudge brownies, and in 
the cool of the evening, nibble on one or two between sips of Petit Sirah. 
Lillie Langtry never dreamed wine from her estate could be so wonderful.

BARBECUE, ITALIAN STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
DISHES OF NAPLES AND SICILY ARE PERFECT FOR DINING -- AND COOKING -- ALFRESCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE SIEGEL, Helene Siegel, co-author of City Cuisine, is currently 
writing The Ethnic Kitchen series for Harper &amp; Row.

<TEXT>
<P>
ONE OF THE greatest insults you can hurl at an Italian host or hostess is to 
say the meal you just shared was like "un pranzo da ristorante" -- a restaurant 
meal -- because everyone knows that the best food is always found at home. 
</P>
<P>
While restaurant food is meant to dazzle with rare ingredients, complex 
technique or splashy presentation, good home cooking is meant to be familiar. 
Its purpose is to soothe and comfort those who have the luck to eat it. 
</P>
<P>
In the summertime, the best way for most of us to relax while entertaining is 
to take the cooking outside. Grilling in Italy today, however, remains a bit 
more rugged than our back-yard barbecuing, according to Antonio Orlando, 
chef-owner of Fresco restaurant in Glendale. In his native Naples, people are 
more likely to cook most of the meal indoors and then take it, along with fish 
or meats, to a beautiful spot in the country. There, they dig a hole in the 
ground, line and surround it with bricks and build a fire with the branches of 
an oak tree. The food is then placed on a grate over the flames to absorb the 
flavors of wood and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
This Italian grilled dinner, with its swordfish, sweet tomatoes, bell peppers, 
eggplant, lemons, honey, figs and greens, is typical of summer eating around 
Naples and Sicily. It also reflects, in the oregano and lemon marinade and figs 
and honey for dessert, the influence of Greek cuisine on Sicilian food. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, grilling birds and fish simply, with little more than olive oil and 
lemon as seasoning, is a centuries-old tradition. Archestratus, a 
4th-Century-BC food writer, advised that good, fatty fish should be 
"sprinkle(d) with a little salt only and baste(d) with oil. For it contains 
within itself alone the reward of joy." 
</P>
<P>
Swordfish, the fatty fish par excellence, is perfect for grilling. The best 
swordfish in Italy is still caught, as it was in ancient times, by harpoon in 
the Straits of Messina, the waters separating Sicily from the mainland. The 
tastiest fish are found in spring and early summer, when they migrate from 
Arctic waters to the warm Mediterranean to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
To entertain in true Italian style, however, it really is not necessary to dig 
a hole in the ground or harpoon a swordfish. More important is where you serve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal spot for such a relaxing meal is alfresco, near the grill, so the 
cook can take part in the conversation. After all, good talk is also an 
important Italian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRUITED WHITE WINE 
</P>
<P>
1 bottle Italian white wine, such as pinot grigio

24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately before serving, pour in sparkling water. Serve in chilled wine 
glasses. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Preheat grill. Brush olive oil on bread and grill until golden and toasty on 
both sides. Spoon chopped tomatoes on bread and serve. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRILLED EGGPLANT WITH SMOKED MOZZARELLA 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 1 small clove) 
</P>
<P>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
</P>
<P>
1 medium eggplant, unpeeled, with stem removed 
</P>
<P>
Olive oil for brushing 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces smoked mozzarella 
</P>
<P>
Preheat grill.

vinegar, tomatoes and garlic. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the eggplant crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, and brush both sides with 
olive oil. Grill one side until eggplant turns black and grill marks appear, 
about 4 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cut smoked mozzarella into 8 slices. Turn eggplant over, place slice of cheese 
on each piece and grill another 4 minutes or until cheese melts. If you are 
grilling outside, cover the grill. Transfer eggplant to plates with spatula, 
spoon dressing over each and serve. Leftover dressing can be spooned over plain 
grilled eggplant. Makes 4-6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWORDFISH SKEWERS WITH LEMON AND PEPPERS 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds swordfish, about 1 1/2 inches thick 
</P>
<P>
Marinade 
</P>
<P>
1 yellow bell pepper, cored and seeded 
</P>
<P>
2 red bell peppers, cored and seeded 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 red onion, peeled 
</P>
<P>
3 lemons 
</P>
<P>
Salt to taste 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fresh, unflavored bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
If using bamboo skewers, soak 6 in water 30 minutes, remove and place in 
freezer (this prevents burning and splintering on grill). 
</P>
<P>
Remove any skin and cut swordfish into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Add fish to marinade; 
cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes, turning pieces 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Preheat grill and brush grate with oil. While grill is heating, cut peppers 
into 1-inch squares and onion into 3 wedges. Halve lemons and cut into 12 small 
wedges. Remove the fish from refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Assemble skewers by alternating pieces of fish with 2 kinds of peppers, 
beginning and ending each with sturdy wedge of lemon. Separate onion into 6 
pieces, and place one in center of each skewer. Sprinkle with salt and brush 
with marinade. Scatter bread crumbs on plate. Dip each skewer in crumbs to 
lightly coat. 
</P>
<P>
Grill over high flame. Using tongs and pot holder, turn skewers every few 
minutes to cook evenly until fish is opaque and vegetables are charred on 
edges, about 10 minutes total. Serve warm. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Marinade 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon cracked black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped fresh oregano or marjoram 
</P>
<P>
Combine olive oil, lemon juice, black pepper and oregano in shallow ceramic or 
glass container. Makes about 1 1/4 cups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRILLED NEW POTATOES 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds small new potatoes, with skins, washed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Coarse salt for sprinkling 
</P>
<P>
Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Cook potatoes just until tender, about 
20 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and pat dry. Pour olive oil into small 
bowl and roll each potato in oil to lightly coat. Sprinkle with salt. 
</P>
<P>
Preheat grill. Grill over high heat until charred all over, about 7 minutes per 
side. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BITTER GREENS AND RADISHES 
</P>
<P>
2 bunches arugula 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch watercress 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 head escarole or chicory 
</P>
<P>
1 small head Boston lettuce 
</P>
<P>
12 radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup black olives cured with herbs, such as provencal 
</P>
<P>
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
</P>
<P>
Remove all stems and cores from the leafy greens. Fill a sink with cold water, 
and soak greens about 15 minutes to remove soil. Lift out leaves, and shake to 
remove excess water. Pat dry with paper towels, or dry in salad spinner (washed 
and dried salad greens may be reserved in open plastic bags in refrigerator up 
to two hours). 
</P>
<P>
Tear greens into bite-size pieces and place in salad bowl. Add radishes and 
olives and toss. 
</P>
<P>
To make dressing: Rub inside of small bowl with garlic clove; discard garlic. 
Whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust 
seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
Toss salad with 1/2 cup of dressing. Add more dressing in small increments as 
needed, being careful not to overdress the salad. All of the leaves should be 
evenly coated; there should be no pool of liquid in bottom of bowl. Extra 
dressing can be stored, covered, in refrigerator. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WARM FIGS WITH HONEY 
</P>
<P>
12 figs, with skins, washed 
</P>
<P>
Honey for drizzling 
</P>
<P>
Cut figs in half lengthwise. Grill over medium to low flame until soft and 
warm, about 3 minutes per side. Place on plates, cut side up, and drizzle 
lightly with honey. Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream if desired. Makes 6 
servings.

STAGE WEEK: 'CLOTHESPINS' PUTS PROGRESS ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Progress takes a back seat to pathos in the California Music Theatre production 
of "Clothespins and Dreams," a jazz/gospel/pop musical that made its world 
premiere Saturday at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. "It takes place in 1911," 
explained Ron Miller, who wrote the book and lyrics to Ken Hirsch's music. 
(They also collaborated on the musical "Satchmo.") 
</P>
<P>
"It was the middle of the Industrial Revolution," he said. "All of these great 
inventions -- and with each, 100 men were out of a job." 
</P>
<P>
But in this story (based on Tom Harris' play "Suds"), it's the women who are in 
trouble. A group of Harlem laundresses are about to be replaced by a new 
monster, the electric washing machine. A contest is waged: Suds, the 
washerwomen's manager, against the newfangled invention -- 20 loads, no breaks, 
in the hot afternoon sun, with Suds' girls cheering her on. "Impoverished 
people have an incredible camaraderie," noted Miller, who grew up poor in 
Chicago. "They laugh and joke at life. That's what keeps their sanity." 
</P>
<P>
Here, they also sing -- a lot. "There are 18 songs, 14 hopefully hysterically 
funny," said the writer, whose song credits include "Touch Me in the Morning" 
and "For Once in My Life." "In one, the women predict the future without 
knowing it: 'We'll have lots of inventions, and they'll control our lives.' " 
There's also a grudging admiration for the enemy. "One woman says, 'This 
machine can put us out of work, but you've got to admit it's a great 
invention.' " 
</P>
<P>
CMT artistic director Gary Davis directs a cast of 20, headed by Eloise Laws, 
Barney Martin, Ren Woods and Jordan Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
DOIN' IT RIGHT: Last year, Everybody's a Player Productions staged "You Can't 
Take It With You" as a benefit for the Stepping Stone Youth Crisis Shelter in 
Santa Monica. This year they've staging Larry Shue's "The Foreigner" currently 
running at the First United Methodist Church in Santa Monica. All proceeds 
again will be donated to Stepping Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping Stone is "the only youth shelter of its kind for homeless or runaway 
youth 7 to 17," says Kim Reinking, a spokesperson for the acting company. "They 
offer food, shelter, clothing and counseling." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's "You Can't Take It With You" netted the shelter approximately 
$6,000, "or about 85% of what it takes to feed 200 kids per year," Reinking 
added. First United Methodist Church is donating its stage. Center Theatre 
Group came across with costumes, and Omega Cinema Props and Cinebar donated 
props. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's the public's turn.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: EXPO '92 IN SEVILLE TO IMPORT OPERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expo '92, scheduled to take place in Seville, Spain, from April 20 to Oct. 12, 
1992, will mount six famous operatic works set in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
The six operas -- Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and "Le Nozze di Figaro," Rossini's 
"Il Barbiere di Siviglia," Beethoven's "Fidelio," Verdi's "La Forza del 
Destino" and Donizetti's "La Favorita" -- will be performed in Seville's new 
opera house, the Maestranza Theater, which will open in the spring of 1991. 
Another operatic masterpiece set in Seville, Bizet's "Carmen," will be produced 
outdoors in the southern Spanish city. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant to Expo '92 in matters musical is the Spanish tenor Placido Domingo 
-- who serves a similar function with Los Angeles Music Center Opera. Domingo 
has planned the operatic repertory at the six-monthlong exposition with Luis 
Andreu Marfa, artistic director of the Maestranza. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians and librettists have made Seville the scenario of their fantasies," 
the tenor said recently in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not take advantage of this? The operas inspired by Seville will be 
presented at Expo '92, and could be the basis for an annual festival." 
</P>
<P>
With negotiations still incomplete, according to spokeswoman Esther Grau of the 
Expo management, the lineup lists "Don Giovanni" as performed by a touring 
company from the Staatsoper, Vienna, and conducted by Claudio Abbado; "Nozze di 
Figaro" from the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, conducted by Zubin Mehta; "Forza 
del Destino" also from Florence, and also conducted by Mehta; "Fidelio" from 
the Metropolitan Opera, New York, conducted by James Levine; "Barbiere di 
Siviglia," from the Rossini Opera Festival of Pessaro, Italy; and "La 
Favorita," about which the spokeswoman had no details. 
</P>
<P>
Seville, Grau said, has no tradition of resident opera -- the Maestranza is the 
first opera house to be built in the city in its history -- a condition which 
will change in the fall of 1991, six months before Expo '92 begins. In October, 
1991, the new Maestranza, with a seating capacity of 1,650, will produce a 
season of four operas: "La Boheme," "Rigoletto," "Tosca" and "Dona 
Francisquita." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of the operatic genre, Marfa said, the new opera house will also host 
zarzuela performances, and concerts by visiting symphony orchestras and ballet 
companies. Among Spanish singers already engaged to appear during the 
festivities are Montserrat Caballe, Alfredo Kraus, Victoria de los Angeles, 
Jose Carreras and Teresa Berganza, the administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
Expo '92 will produce 55,000 separate performances, according to Manuel 
Olivencia, commissioner general of the State Corporation for Expo '92. "From 
the very highest level of classical culture to mass popular entertainment and 
the avant-garde -- there will be something to suit all tastes," Olivencia said. 
</P>
<P>
The exposition begins on Easter Monday of 1992, and closes on Columbus' 
birthday, nearly six months later. Official estimates are that 18 million 
visitors will attend Expo '92. To date, Olivencia said, 103 nations, 21 
international organizations and 23 multinational corporations have officially 
accepted invitations to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the exposition, which celebrates the 500th anniversary of 
Columbus' encounter with the new world, is "The Age of Discoveries." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Maestranza Theater, other show places being constructed for Expo 
'92 include an open-air theater seating 7,000; an outdoor cinema; a large, 
canopied plaza to be called the Planeque Marque; Cinema Street, which will 
recreate famous Hollywood film sets; an exhibition arena for circuses and 
rodeos; a track and field complex; a facility for water sports, and several 
more indoor and outdoor theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Offsite, Olivencia said, historical venues in and outside the city will also be 
available to Expo events: the Lope de Vega theater -- a legacy of the 
Ibero-American Exhibition of 1929 -- and the Amfiteatro Romano in the suburb of 
Italica. 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSERS' CORNER: The 80th birthday of William Schuman, which was celebrated 
Aug. 4, is being noted all through 1990 with various performances of the 
composer's works. An important revival of the Symphony No. 3 -- Schuman 
discarded the first two symphonies -- was given at the Cabrillo Festival in 
Santa Cruz last month, with Dennis Russell Davies conducting. Davies also 
conducted the Third Symphony, on Schuman's birthday, at the Tanglewood 
Festival. On Sept. 26, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will play the Third 
Symphony in Carnegie Hall, opening the historic hall's centennial celebration. 
In December, the Juilliard Opera Center in New York will perform two Schuman 
operas, "The Mighty Casey" and "A Question of Taste," both conducted by Gerard 
Schwarz. And, among many other Schuman performances scheduled through the end 
of the 1990-91 season, Schwarz will lead the Seattle Symphony in the Symphony 
No. 5 in Seattle in April. . . . The family of the late Alfred Newman has 
donated $1 million to the School of Music at USC for the building and equipment 
for a recital hall, green room and memorial lobby to be named after the film 
composer, who died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Edo de Waart, music director of the Minnesota Symphony, has been named 
principal guest conductor at Santa Fe Opera commencing with the 1991 summer 
season. De Waart's first assignments in his New Mexico position are three 
Mozart operas: "Nozze di Figaro" in 1991, "Don Giovanni" in 1992 and "Magic 
Flute" in 1993. . . . Soprano Gail Robinson, a former member of the roster at 
the Metropolitan Opera, has been named executive director of the Met's National 
Council Auditions and director of the company's Young Artist Development 
Program, succeeding Lawrence Stayer, who died in April. . . . Choreographer 
Garth Fagan has changed the name of his dance company, formerly called Garth 
Fagan Bucket Dance, to Garth Fagan Dance. Now approaching the end of its second 
decade, the Fagan company is in the midst of celebrating its 20th anniversary; 
the celebrations will culminate with a gala in Rochester, New York, where the 
troupe is still based, in November.

ON THE RECORD: THE MOZART REQUIEM: NEW RECORDINGS, PERSPECTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A familiar story regarding Mozart's last days concerns the mysterious, 
gray-clad (masked as well, in one fanciful account) stranger who arrived on 
Mozart's Vienna doorstep with a bag of money to commission a Requiem mass, with 
the proviso that the composer's name not appear on the manuscript. Death 
himself, sending Mozart a none-too-subtle message? 
</P>
<P>
As mundane truth would have it, the stranger was an emissary of a nobleman 
accustomed to passing off other people's works as his own, a common practice of 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart, harassed by conflicting deadlines and in failing health, accepted the 
commission but died before the task could be finished. He and, subsequently, 
his widow entrusted that job to his pupil and associate, Franz Xaver Sussmayr. 
</P>
<P>
The Sussmayr edition has survived for at least two good reasons: It is 
unquestionably skillful and it completes a work to which Mozart's own 
contributions, completed or in sketch form, display his genius at its most 
exalted. Then, too, those portions Sussmayr himself had to compose from 
(presumed) scratch are easily the best -- perhaps the only -- Sussmayr most of 
us have heard, although he was himself a prolific, successful and, like Mozart, 
short-lived composer. 
</P>
<P>
But we live in an age of scholarly inquiry and are about to embark on a Mozart 
year. The validity and primacy of the Mozart-Sussmayr Requiem are therefore 
being questioned as never before, with other editions coming to the fore. 
Recordings serve as the testing ground. 
</P>
<P>
Within one recent month, four new recordings of Mozart's Requiem have reached 
us, and while two nominally employ Sussmayr's edition, none of the four really 
resembles the others. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Sussmayrs: The venerated Carlo Maria Giulini, directing London's 
Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus, presents (on Sony Classical 45577) the sort 
of thickly textured, slow (in this instance, even slower), reverential 
Romanticization which has served audiences, if not Mozart, for most of the 20th 
Century. The only rewarding aspect of this otherwise sodden exercise is Lynne 
Dawson's ethereal yet rich-toned execution of the soprano solos. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch conductor-scholar Ton Koopman traverses Mozart-Sussmayr, with what 
sounds like some orchestral touching-up, in 47 minutes, compared to Giulini's 
full hour, without imparting a feeling of excessive haste (Erato 45472). 
</P>
<P>
Koopman's Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra and Netherlands Bach Choir -- much 
smaller forces than Giulini employs -- play and sing with consistent alertness, 
lift and skill. The light-voiced solo quartet, headed by soprano Barbara 
Schlick, produces an attractive sound individually and in ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Reasonable clarity of texture is achieved as well with what would seem to be 
the sizable forces of the London Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra under a 
conductor previously unknown to this listener, Franz Welser-Most (EMI/Angel 
2150, mid-price). 
</P>
<P>
The edition used is by Franz Beyer, dating from 1971 and while based on 
Sussmayr, re-orchestrates some of the pupil's work in what Beyer regards as a 
style closer to the master's own. The changes are audible, but not of major 
consequence. 
</P>
<P>
Welser-Most's hearty, vibrant leadership represents a viable compromise between 
the quickness and intensity of the antiquarians and the loftiness of 
traditional interpretations. Of the soloists, bass Willard White leaves the 
most positive impression, booming his lines with impressive dignity. 
</P>
<P>
H. C. Robbins Landon, among the most respected of living Haydn and Mozart 
scholars, recently produced his own edition of the Requiem, basing it on a 
re-evaluation of all available sources. Its first recording is by the Hanover 
Band and Chorus under Roy Goodman (Nimbus 5241). 
</P>
<P>
Without necessarily being aware of Robbins Landon's extensive revisions of the 
standard texts, listeners are still likely to miss some of the Requiem's 
traditional thrills -- whoever may have invented them -- such as the 
trumpets-and-drums fury that ends the "Dies irae" and the orchestral grandeur 
of "Rex tremendae," which sounds relatively piddly here. 
</P>
<P>
But the edition, which may just require getting used to, isn't the major 
problem. Rather, it's that the performance is too often stiff and phlegmatic, 
the result perhaps of excessive caution toward what is in large part an 
untested entity. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus and the solo quartet -- Gundula Janowitz, Julia Bernheimer, Martyn 
Hill and David Thomas -- are, ironically, among the most accomplished on 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
A final word: A notably successful combination of Sussmayr's edition and 
stylish interpretation is that by the period forces under John Eliot Gardiner's 
direction (Philips 420 197). It also contains the priceless bonus of Mozart's 
rarely heard Kyrie in D minor, K. 341, which made such a stunning impression on 
audiences in its performance at the recent UCLA Baroque Mozart Festival.

**** CHARLES LLOYD "FISH OUT OF WATER" ECM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On this contemplative, sometimes ethereal recording, his first for ECM, 
saxophonist-flutist Charles Lloyd, who tends to look inward for musical 
direction, reaches a transcendent plateau, interweaving his interest in things 
spiritual with the bluesy roots of his native Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
It's this Memphis connection that keeps the session from developing into New 
Age atmospherics as Lloyd plays searching, sometimes Coltrane-flavored tenor 
with plenty of subtle bluesy touches, all in an airy, understated way. 
</P>
<P>
His flute work on "Tellaro," isn't as successful; though meditative enough, it 
too often approaches Paul Horn-ish banality. Pianist Bobo Stenson, bassist 
Palle Danielsson and drummer Jon Christensen sound remarkably similar to trios 
led by pianist Keith Jarrett, the pianist from the original Lloyd Quartet. BILL

ON THE OFFBEAT: NON-MAINSTREAM POP FROM N.Y., AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN, Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a 
classic). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the days before Madonna and CD's and Federal Express, port cities were the 
places where intriguing musical juxtapositions were usually forged, since the 
local musicians there were constantly exposed to music from far-flung locales. 
</P>
<P>
Now, technology enables musicians all over the world to keep abreast of the 
latest sounds and styles, and those juxtapositions -- particularly those rising 
from contact between traditional styles and Western pop sounds -- take more 
varied forms. That's the focus of this edition of On the Off Beat, a periodic 
review of roots, ethnic and non-mainstream pop music from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 JOHN ZORN, "Spy Vs. Spy," Elektra/Musician. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 JOHN ZORN, "Naked City," Elektra/Nonesuch. Saxophonist Zorn, a leading 
figure on New York's experimental music scene, positively revels in 
juxtapositions. With "Spy Vs. Spy," it's "acoustic hard-core" versions of 
Ornette Coleman's compositions -- i.e., no electric instruments but 
performances characterized by the high-octane energy of punk. It works, since 
Zorn and fellow alto man Tim Berne are too smart and skillful to lose the 
bluesy threads of Coleman's melodies in the rampaging rhythm section. 
</P>
<P>
In the electric "Naked City," the juxtapositions are in the compositions and 
arrangements -- like Zorn playing the mournful melody to Coleman's "Lonely 
Woman" over a rhythm section digging into Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman" riff. A 
stellar quintet negotiates the hairpin turns as Zorn zips through genres -- 
'60s instrumental rock, hard-core blasts, '50s R&amp;B, avant-noise, lush movie 
themes, monster metal riffing -- like someone channel-hopping with a TV 
remote-control unit. 
</P>
<P>
** VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Bhangra Now," Multitone. 
</P>
<P>
*** VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Bhangra Power," Multitone (both English imports). What is 
Bhangra pop? Apparently it's a hybrid of reggae, pop, dance and Indian 
sound-track music developed by Indian and Pakistani teen-agers who grew up in 
England. On "Bhangra Now," spirited romps like "Gurdh Nalo Isqh Mitah" have a 
Middle-Eastern tinge reminiscent of Algeria's rai music, while "Bhangra Rap" 
resembles soca more than hip-hop. Most of the artists on "Bhangra Now" don't 
sound like they have a grip on Bhangra pop as a coherent style. 
</P>
<P>
They do on "Bhangra Power." From the opening salvo of go-go rhythms topped by 
the cascading Indian melody line of "Bhangra Paa Ni Bhangra Paa," the 
arrangements are tighter and the overall performances more confident. 
</P>
<P>
**** MAHMOUD AHMED, "Ere Mela Mela," Hannibal. A collection of tracks recorded 
between 1975 and '78 by the veteran Ethiopian pop star and available for the 
first time here. Ahmed's cutting, spiraling vocals fall in the Islamic pop mode 
and the strong blues/R&amp;B flavor achieves a flowing groove with moody 
undercurrents. Fascinating stuff. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 ROSSY "Madagascar," Celluloid/Melodie import. Rossy is a youthful septet 
from Madagascar whose "Raha Manina Anay" on a GlobeStyle compilation a few 
years ago was a revelation. On this double album, Rossy's unusual blend of 
acoustic guitars and clattering percussion lays down grooves that somehow sound 
both choppy and flowing while layered vocals create appealingly 
ragged-but-right harmonies. The arrangements have traces of South African 
mbqanga, reggae and other Caribbean styles, and an exuberance reminiscent of 
'50s rock. 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 GONDWANALAND, "Let the Dog Out," WEA Australia import. Great idea -- 
combine the aboriginal instrument the didgeridu, which sounds something like a 
deep-pitched, organic synthesizer, with high-tech keyboards and percussion. But 
the execution falls short on this Australian instrumental trio's 1988 release. 
Charlie McMahon's didgeridu is occasionally hemmed in by Eddy Duquemin's 
percussion, but the empty bombast of Peter Carolan's pomp-rock keyboard 
melodies is the biggest problem. The atmospheric pieces work better, but 
Gondwanaland should figure out more creative ways to prominently feature the 
didgeridu.

POP EYE: MICHAEL'S MANAGERS SPLIT, 'PRENUPTIAL' PACT EASES PAIN 
</P>

<P>
When a show-biz marriage starts with a prenuptial agreement, you'll never go 
broke betting on a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
That's one way to look at last week's demise of the four-year partnership 
between high-profile managers Michael Lippman and Rob Kahane. The rock 
management split, which leaves Kahane with superstar client George Michael and 
Lippman with a host of top rock producers, came in the wake of insider reports 
that Kahane was eager to devote more time to Michael's career. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in any relationship people have specific directions they're going in 
-- and Michael (Lippman) and I were simply going in different directions," said 
Kahane, who will also take such up-and-comers as Megadeth and Michael McDermott 
to his new firm. "I wanted to focus on launching George's career, but as the 
company grew there was more time requested of me to deal with other areas of 
our business than I had time to give." 
</P>
<P>
When managers split, relations can sour quickly, especially when ex-partners 
fight over claims to lucrative management commissions. But Lippman and Kahane 
both confirmed that the team had signed a "prenuptial-type contract," which 
prescribed the parameters of their relationship. "It's very clear," said 
Kahane. "There are no question marks." Lippman concurred: "We still have 
financial ties. I'll continue to have a financial interest in George Michael's 
career, including his upcoming album and tour." 
</P>
<P>
Lippman said he plans to concentrate on working with his roster of producers, 
who include such heavyweights as Mike Clink (who's produced Guns N' Roses), Ron 
Nevison (Chicago), Don Gehman (John Cougar Mellencamp) and Richie Zito (Heart 
and Cheap Trick). He also plans to establish a new publishing company that 
would continue a pre-existing affiliation with Warner/Chappel Music. "Managing 
artists was always important to me," Lippman explained. "But my philosophy has 
always been -- keep it small. The company just got to be too much." 
</P>
<P>
As for Kahane, he's busy touting George Michael, who returns next month with a 
new album, "Listen Without Prejudice Vol. I." Kahane revealed an intriguing new 
nugget: Michael's first single, "Praying for Time," due Aug. 24, will be 
released without the traditional MTV video. 
</P>
<P>
"George wants the music to speak for itself -- and his music is so commercially 
viable that I'm in total agreement with him," said Kahane. "Too many superstars 
today are more worried about reinventing their image through videos than 
worrying about their music. Look at Madonna -- she's done great things with her 
image, but I don't think her music has grown." 
</P>
<P>
Kahane quickly added that Michael's video ban won't leave MTV completely out in 
the cold, saying the video channel will air a one-hour special on two nights, 
beginning Sept. 8, about the making of his new album.

AND FINALLY: Our Band Name of the Week (baseball division) goes to the New 
York-based group Honus Wagner (named after the great Pittsburgh Pirates 
shortstop), who are in town Monday at Al's Bar. . . . And if you're if looking 
for rap on the razor's edge, get a copy of "HollyWord," the new spoken-word 
collection from Rhino/WordBeat Records. Masterminded by Harvey Kubernik and due 
out this week, it features provocative patter from such rocksters as Jane's 
Addiction's Perry Farrell, Fishbone's Angelo Moore and Paul Kantner (plus raps 
from such unlikely TV-types as Gavin MacLeod, Katey Sagal and Patti 
D'Arbanville).

TALK OF THE TOWN: So is Michael Jackson going to have a new manager or not? 
That's Topic A in record-biz circles this week, now that most execs are getting 
over their shock and dismay at seeing their names in (or not in) the dreaded 
"Hit Men" expose, which has already jumped to No. 8 on The Times' best-seller 
list. Initially, the hottest contenders were the top management duos of Stiefel 
&amp; Edwards and Lippman &amp; Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
But with L&amp;K having split up and S&amp;E involved with Prince (whom Jackson 
considers a pop rival) a new name has emerged among industry insiders as a 
leading candidate. The hot ticket? Veteran manager Sandy Gallin, who handles 
the likes of Neil Diamond, Dolly Parton and Andrew Dice Clay. Gallin is also 
considered a favorite by some observers because of his friendship with David 
Geffen, Jackson's confidante and close adviser. Meanwhile, execs at CBS 
Records, Jackson's label, are nervously awaiting an upcoming meeting with Bert 
Fields, the influential (and combative) entertainment attorney who is handling 
Jackson's renegotiations with CBS.

and editing process inherent in the making of art -- without a sculptural 
accompaniment. The show, which runs through Sept. 8, features drawings for an 
upcoming installation at the L.A. County Museum of Art, as well as drawings for 
both realized and unrealized new works.

COLONIAL CUISINE IN BEVERLY HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
RANGOON RACQUET CLUB AIMS FOR THE IMAGE OF A GENTLEMEN'S CLUB IN THE GOOD DAYS 
IN BURMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Ralph Lauren ever does a Burmese collection, he ought to shoot the ads at 
Beverly Hills' Rangoon Racquet Club. The place is said to be modeled after the 
original Rangoon Racquet Club in the capital of Myanmar (formerly known as 
Burma), and its owner, Emanuel Zwaaf, served in Burma during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The stylistic conceit of the place is of a comfortable colonial gentlemen's 
club in Southeast Asia. Latticework frames the room, which is cooled by 
slow-rotating ceiling fans. A jungle-scene mural dominates one wall. And the 
waiters are dressed to look as if they might have just stepped out of one the 
restaurant's many photos of Victorian-era colonial troops. 
</P>
<P>
Polite intimations of the exotic aside, the restaurant promises comfort and 
good food of an attractively old-fashioned sort. The room is lit just brightly 
enough, and with a warm glow. The spacious red leather-look booths practically 
beg to be slid into. And the menu is large, varied and tantalizing, suggesting 
a cross between Trader Vic's and something like the old Brown Derby, with maybe 
a touch of the Bistro thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
But once you've been in the place for a few minutes, the pukka-sahib routine 
begins to pale: It starts to seem like a very short trip from here to the 
Elephant Bar, visually at least -- and anyway, maybe mock nostalgia for British 
colonialism isn't exactly the most appropriate restaurant theme today. And 
those booths resist sliding, because the seat portions aren't leather at all, 
but a rough-textured fabric that clings to trousers and dresses. Most 
disappointing of all, though, the food is all over the map in quality as well 
as in geographical origin. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners start off well enough with a complimentary "Scotch egg," an egg 
hard-boiled, then baked in a thin pastry crust stuffed with ground veal and 
beef. Also on the house are long tongues of delicious cheese toast and an 
assortment of pickled peppers and olives. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond these beginnings, the food is sometimes just what it ought to be in a 
place like this: Crab-and-shrimp lumpia is a single crisp egg roll with a 
well-seasoned seafood filling, served with orange-marmalade mustard and 
Indonesian-style catsup and an excellent concoction from Malaysia called 
Lingham &amp; Sons Chilly Sauce, salty-sweet and amiably hot. Cream of clams, 
mussels and shrimp is a rich and pleasing soup, if not exactly bursting with 
fresh shellfish flavor. Oysters Serangoon, oysters glazed with curry sauce and 
returned to their shells atop a bed of spinach, are very good. And the 
restaurant's well-loved cold peanut soup, full of shredded chicken, remains an 
unusual and appealing specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the restaurant's specialties, chili made according to former Wrather 
Corp. executive and perennial chili contest winner C.V. Wood's award-winning 
recipe, is full of flavor, if not particularly spicy. But it is garnished with 
bland, cardboardy restaurant-supply-company tortilla chips, which no serious 
restaurant in Los Angeles has any business serving. 
</P>
<P>
Lean slices of calf's liver, cooked medium-rare as ordered, were superb one 
night, with a scattering of freshly fried onions on top. Chicken hash "21" 
(based on the famous creamy hash served at New York's "21" Club) is a generous 
serving of chopped dark meat in a lightly seasoned cream sauce, surrounded by a 
piping of duchesse potatoes. It's sort of a silly dish, but it's comforting and 
satisfying. And there's something appealingly luxurious about the thick, 
custardy creme brulee, though the big globs of whipped cream and the chocolate 
piping around the plate seem out of place. 
</P>
<P>
There's something else more seriously out of place here, though. When the food 
misses, as it often does, the failures seem due more to simple carelessness 
than to any lack of culinary skill in the kitchen. Emanuel Zwaaf's obvious 
professionalism (and frequent presence) notwithstanding, there often doesn't 
seem to be a commanding officer in charge. 
</P>
<P>
The problems begin with something as simple as the bread: French bread of 
average quality, sliced from a long baguette, that on two occasions had been 
practically cremated in the warming oven. Indeed, the smell of burning bread 
wafts regularly through the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, a perfectly decent Caesar salad was ruined by ice-cold lettuce 
leaves that had been improperly dried, so that the dressing was watery and 
thin. Gazpacho, attractively presented with separate little bowls of minced 
onions, cucumber, green pepper and croutons on the side, was obviously a little 
too old or had been stored at too high a temperature one evening and had begun 
to ferment. 
</P>
<P>
Among the main dishes, of which the menu offers more than 40, steamed clams and 
mussels in Pernod tasted of nothing but Pernod on one occasion, and the waiter 
neglected to offer the garlic toast and rouille the menu promised. Shrimp and 
chicken curry, elaborately served with an embarrassment of condiments, 
consisted of one small piece of tough, overcooked chicken and three rather 
tired shrimp, cloaked in a sweet curry sauce as thick as preserves. Maybe 
British colonials in Rangoon liked their curry this way, but that's no excuse 
for imposing it on L.A. diners. 
</P>
<P>
On another evening, the sauteed lamb chops were tender and certainly of good 
basic quality, but the thyme sauce with which they were coated was sweet to the 
point of being sugary, and the accompanying flageolet beans were overcooked 
almost to a puree. The RRC chopped steak was generous in size, but the meat 
just didn't taste like much of anything -- at least until our waiter suggested 
dosing it with the aforementioned Lingham Sauce, which fixed it up just fine. 
(What does it say about a restaurant when the best sauce on the table comes in 
a bottle from Malaysia?) 
</P>
<P>
At the end of my last evening here, by the time the waiters had disappeared, 
neglecting to bring the chocolate-covered walnut pieces that Rangoon usually 
offers after dinner, or to ask if anyone would like a second cup of coffee or 
an after-dinner drink, I was left with the inescapable sense that this 
once-good restaurant just isn't trying very hard anymore.

NOTEBOOK: THEY'RE BACK -- COFFEEHOUSES ARE PERCOLATING AGAIN IN THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Unicorn, the Cafe Renaissance, the Bit, Caffe Espresso, the mysterious 
Positano in Malibu and other L.A. area coffeehouses of the '60s are long gone 
-- but a coffeehouse revival has recently visited our city, bringing us instead 
such establishments as Java, Mama Pajama, Highland Grounds, the Living Room and 
the new Axe (pronounced "ah-SHAY") in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Now veteran restaurant manager Lawrence Casperson wants to, as he says, "up the 
ante" with a new coffeehouse-plus, which he plans to call the King's Road 
Espresso Bar Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Casperson, a transplanted San Franciscan, has worked for Bay Area restaurant 
entrepreneur Sam Du Vall since 1981 as a part of the management team that 
opened Izzy's Steak and Chop House and Samantha's in San Francisco and the Ritz 
Cafe and the Sugar Shack in L.A. (Du Vall has just invested the Sugar Shack, 
incidentally, with a new menu, a new chef and a new name -- Mango Reef.) Now, 
Casperson is joining forces with two fellow San Franciscans -- City Restaurant 
head chef Wendy Brucker (who also cooked at Stars and Square One in S.F.), who 
will create the King's Road menu and consult on the food while retaining her 
position at City, and Bay Area artist Michael Brennan, who will design the 
cafe's interior. "This is kind of an 'old friends from San Francisco' venture," 
offers Casperson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually a big fan of places like the Living Room and Java," he continues, 
"but I want to do something a little different. We're going to offer food 
that's something like you might typically see at a cafe in Italy -- panini 
sandwiches, a couple of little pizzas, pannetone toast for breakfast, things 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
King's Road, to be located on the corner of that street and Beverly Boulevard, 
approximately across the street from the Mandarette, is scheduled to open in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
NEW TABLES IN TOWN: Mauro Vincenti is about to open Pazzeria, which he 
describes as "the pizzeria of Pazzia" -- on the site of the original Pazzia 
bar, across the courtyard from the restaurant itself, and in a space adjacent 
to the bar that he has recently taken over on La Cienega Boulevard. "Pizza, 
pasta and vegetables" will be the theme, Vincenti says . . . A new La Salsa has 
debuted in the Marina Marketplace complex in Marina del Rey -- the first unit 
of the fast-food Mexican chain to be a full-scale restaurant, complete with 100 
seats, waiter service and a full bar. This one is a franchise, owned by Michael 
Condon, once a manager of the Ginger Man in Beverly Hills and later co-owner of 
the now-closed Wave in Santa Monica. . . . Meanwhile, the California Pizza 
Kitchen chain has just opened its latest restaurant, the 14th, on Ventura 
Boulevard in Studio City . . . Richard and Jennifer Chang, owners of the tiny 
Chang's Kitchen in Beverly Hills, have launched the full-sized Chang's Szechwan 
and Seafood Restaurant in Palms. (Various members of the Chang family also own 
restaurants in West L.A., Brentwood and Encino.) . . . And scheduled for an 
Aug. 20 opening is Caffe Zaretti in Northridge, to be opened by Giancarlo 
Zaretti, former proprietor of L'Etoile in West L.A. and Pontevecchio in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>

I wish I could make millions at my job and still be able to claim immunity from 
liability.

GAY-BASHING IN THE RECORD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by the public image of many gay-bashing rock musicians, their struggle 
for masculine security continues. 
</P>
<P>
What else explains their tendency toward portraying women as phallic slaves and 
looking more confused in their gender identities than do most avowed 
homsexuals? 
</P>
<P>
Without whole men to call our youths out of an increasingly long and confused 
adolescence, the gap between homophobes (and their troubadours) and homosexuals 
will only widen. 
</P>
<P>
Gay activists swat at symptoms in attempting to silence gay-bashing rockers.

GAY-BASHING IN THE RECORD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's become pretty clear that as long as the power structure in the United 
States remains in the hands of the heterosexual males, prejudice against male 
homosexuals will be tolerated, if not encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
The way male homosexuals' increasingly vocal show of self-determination is 
dealt with is the way totalitarian groups react: Government tacitly condones 
discrimination by inaction, religion raises the Bible on high, and big business 
(here the record industry) takes no responsibility for its product. Hey, we're 
talking First Amendment rights here -- and making a buck.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: READ HIS LIPS: DRAG PERFORMANCE IS DESIGNED TO BE RIDICULOUS, 
ABSURD AND FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
John Epperson imagined a career in straight entertainment would be a drag. 
</P>
<P>
But a career in drag might be great entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to do something ridiculous and absurd," said Epperson, 35, who 
will bring his drag act Thursday to Cafe Largo in the Fairfax District. "I 
discovered I could make people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
So he became Lypsinka, the star of a 20-song, 30-minute musical journey. He 
deliberately seeks out songs from the unheralded. "I pride myself on finding 
the most obscure stuff. If people know the songs, they'll know it's not me 
singing, and that will decrease the illusion." 
</P>
<P>
Epperson, who was a rehearsal pianist for the American Ballet Theater and who 
has also performed his act in New York, sings the songs of Delores Gray, Kay 
Thompson and Mimi Hines, and goes through several costume changes. Eventually, 
he hopes to graduate to another career level. 
</P>
<P>
"I do find lip-syncing limiting," he said. "I can do more things with my voice, 
and someday, I will. I can sing." 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Boccara, co-owner of Cafe Largo, considers his club ideal for 
Epperson's cabaret-style routine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all camp," he said. "It moves so fast, the story of camp in a half hour." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for Epperson's show will cost $6. 
</P>
<P>
John Epperson will present his drag act at Cafe Largo, 432 N. Fairfax, at 9 and 
10:15 p.m. Aug. 16. For information, call 213-852-1073.

<P>
 A new record of traditional country music by San Fernando Valley artists has 
recently been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Down in the Valley," the independent album features 10 songs by 10 
country performers. Producer Dave Pearlman said the concept is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is real traditional country music in L.A.," Pearlman said, "but that's 
not what is being recorded. You hear rock 'n' roll bands who bought cowboy 
hats; that's not real country. We have people who lean more toward Merle 
Haggard and George Jones." 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman said it's too early to gauge the level of interest in the record, 
which has just been sent out to the record companies. A release party will be 
held at Tuesday's Barn Dance concert at the Palomino in North Hollywood. Most 
of the artists involved will sing their tunes from the record. Among the 
performers: Eddie Dunbar, Dale Watson, Heather Myles, Joe Williamson, Re 
Winkler, Jenny Yates, Dave Austin, Theresa James, R.B. Greaves and Pearlman. 
</P>
<P>
The hard rock group Tuff, which sold out two shows at the Roxy last month, has 
signed a record contract with Atlantic/Titanium. 
</P>
<P>
Tuff, which has often played at Reseda's Country Club, is scheduled to begin 
studio work in late August. Shelly Berggren, the group's booking agent, said 
the band will record many of the songs they've played in Los Angeles the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The signing marks the end of an 18-month search. There is no date yet for the 
album's release.

TIMES TELEVISION GUIDE EXPANDS CABLE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times Valley Edition and West Valley Cablevision have entered 
into an agreement for The Times to produce a newly expanded, weekly television 
guide with broadcast and cable television listings and features. 
</P>
<P>
The new book, a redesigned version of TV Times, will be available in all copies 
of The Times delivered or sold in the area served by West Valley Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
That area includes communities north of Ventura Boulevard, west of the San 
Diego Freeway to the county line and north to Granada Hills. Jeff Hall, 
president of The Times Valley and Ventura County editions, said the redesigned 
TV Times guide will be "colorful, easy to use and more comprehensive than any 
other guide available." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Belcher, executive vice president and general manager of West Valley 
Cablevision, said, "I look forward to working with The Times in providing this 
guide, which will give our customers many benefits and advantages previous 
books were not able to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Hall added that he expected to be able to make similar announcements regarding 
new system-specific program guides for other area cable companies within a few 
weeks.

PARK SUPPORTERS ROOT FOR REMAP; 
</P>
<P>
MOUNTAINS: THE SANTA MONICAS WOULD END UP IN SUPERVISOR ED EDELMAN'S DISTRICT. 
HE IS CONSIDERED MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONSERVATION CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Park advocates involved in efforts to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains are 
keeping their fingers crossed in hopes that a court-ordered redrawing of Los 
Angeles County supervisorial districts will survive an appeal by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists believe the boundary realignment, intended to create a Latino 
majority district, will also help their cause by putting the mountains in a 
single district to be served by Supervisor Ed Edelman. They consider Edelman 
more attuned to environmental concerns than the area's current representatives, 
Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana, who have traditionally sided with developers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it augurs well," said one conservationist, who would not allow herself 
to be quoted by name. "I kneel by the side of my bed each night and pray that 
that map goes through." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tryon, executive officer for the Los Angeles/Ventura region of the 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, acknowledged that the 
redistricting "has a potential of boding less favorably for us as an industry" 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. But Tryon said the association will go on 
working "with the Board of Supervisors . . . regardless of how their boundary 
lines may be drawn." 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting map drawn by civil rights groups was approved Aug. 3 by U.S. 
District Judge David V. Kenyon. He ruled in June that the supervisors had 
intentionally discriminated against Latinos by drawing the existing district 
boundaries so as to dilute their voting strength. The county appealed that 
ruling and last Thursday got the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay 
implemention of the reapportionment plan, pending a hearing scheduled for next 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monicas currently are split into three districts. Edelman's district 
includes the eastern end of the mountains from Griffith Park to the San Diego 
Freeway, but Dana and Antonovich represent the less-developed western areas 
where most development battles are being fought. Dana's current district 
includes the Malibu coast and the Santa Monicas' southern slopes, and 
Antonovich's includes the oak-studded valleys and hills of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's order would push Edelman's 3rd Supervisorial District westward through 
the mountains to the Ventura County line. Antonovich would also yield to 
Edelman much of his current base in the San Fernando Valley, including portions 
of the Simi hills. 
</P>
<P>
Dana and Antonovich, part of the Board of Supervisors' conservative majority, 
have received lavish support from real estate interests, and have usually sided 
with them in development battles. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, while no "flaming environmentalist," in the words of one activist, has 
been more receptive to environmental concerns. In two recent cases, he cast the 
only dissenting votes on controversial projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Edelman has voted . . . our way more than any other supervisor," said David 
Brown, vice president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation and chairman of 
the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains task force. "He's tended to be the one 
supervisor who held out for reasonable planning," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state agency that acquires parkland in the mountains, said 
Edelman would be likely to take "a much more careful look at the cumulative 
impact" of development than Antonovich and Dana. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment "will make a difference for preservation of the mountains," 
said Barbara Fine, vice president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns., adding that she was not speaking on behalf of that organization. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five supervisors has a single vote, and redistricting would not 
change that. However, supervisors typically vote the wishes of the colleague in 
whose district a project is located. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, who was reelected in June to a four-year term, cannot be counted on 
"as a knee-jerk vote for anything," his press deputy Joel Bellman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been adamantly, inflexibly anti-development," said Bellman, "but I 
think it's fair to say he's been one of the more sensitive board members" to 
environmental and homeowner concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman alone has escaped the ire of critics who have accused the supervisors 
of undermining efforts to acquire lands needed to complete the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. The mountain park is struggling against 
tight budgets and soaring land prices. Critics, including some members of 
Congress, have accused the supervisors of inflating land prices by agreeing to 
"upzone" mountain property to allow more intensive development than county 
plans provide. The supervisors have said they are balancing the needs of the 
park with the rights of property owners to develop their land. 
</P>
<P>
A recent controversy involved the Paramount Ranch project, a proposed luxury 
housing development on an Agoura site that the government hoped to buy for the 
recreation area. The tract was zoned for 103 homes and park supporters urged 
supervisors to hold the line there. This, they said, would reduce the project's 
impact on adjacent federal land and give the government a better chance to 
acquire it. With Edelman dissenting, the supervisors voted, 3 to 1, last year 
to approve construction of 150 homes. 
</P>
<P>
In another case last December, Edelman dissented from the board's 4-1 approval 
of a controversial golf course, country club and housing development in Corral 
Canyon in Malibu. Bob Hope, owner of the tract, has since canceled the project 
as part of an effort to win support for his Jordan Ranch development in eastern 
Ventura County.

VAN NUYS MAN KILLED IN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man died Saturday morning from injuries he received in a barroom 
brawl in North Hollywood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Firpo, 25, was punched and kicked by two assailants and at 1:35 a.m. was 
left lying unconscious in the parking lot of FM Station, a nightclub at 11700 
Victory Blvd. in North Hollywood, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Christopher 
Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Firpo was driven by a friend to the Medical Center of North Hollywood, where he 
died at 2:22 a.m., Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are searching for two men who beat Firpo, Vasquez said. One is described 
as white, about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and between 25 and 30 years old. Police 
said he was wearing his brown hair in a ponytail and has a large tattoo, 
possibly of a bird, on the left side of his back. The other suspect is 
described as white, between 25 and 27 years old, with brown shoulder-length 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that after beating Firpo, the men jumped into the bed of a 
full-size white pickup truck and escaped with a third suspect at the wheel. 
Police have no description of the driver, Vasquez said.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: UNIONS PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. GORDON, DAVID M. GORDON is professor of economics at the New School 
for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most stunning trends in the U.S. economy during the past 15 years 
has been the decline of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Can this trend be reversed? Should it? Do U.S. labor unions have a future? 
</P>
<P>
I think the answer to all three questions is yes, but I also fear that the 
obstacles are slippery and steep. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking index of labor's declining strength and influence is revealed 
in its share of the labor force. Union members as a percentage of the 
non-agricultural work force reached its peak, 35%, in 1954. Union share then 
slipped gradually through the early 1970s to 26% by 1973. It then fell sharply; 
by the late 1980s, union members accounted for scarcely more than 15% of the 
non-farm labor force. 
</P>
<P>
Other, more qualitative indicators tell much the same story. Through its 
integral membership in the Democratic Party's postwar political coalition, 
organized labor enjoyed considerable political influence through the late 1960s 
and early 1970s; its role as a key political actor was simply presumed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as business sensed an opening and took the offensive, growing numbers of 
politicians began to cater more attentively to corporate interests. Labor's 
declining numerical strength left it ill-prepared to counter this turn toward 
business. Increasingly, unions came to be viewed in the public arena as a 
"special interest," selfish and inflexible. Where organized labor's endorsement 
and political support was once eagerly sought by Democratic Party politicians, 
many now run in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
What accounts for these falling fortunes? 
</P>
<P>
It's useful first to eliminate the irrelevant. For one thing, such declining 
strength is not some inevitable byproduct of post-industrial societies; in many 
other advanced countries, labor unions' size and influence have grown during 
the past 20 years, rather than eroded. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in neighboring Canada -- which is like the United States in many 
respects -- labor's share, once comparable to that in the United States, has 
climbed in recent decades to roughly 40% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the onset of labor's weakness be explained simply by notable changes in 
the composition of the labor force -- growing portions of women, immigrants and 
younger workers. Henry S. Farber, labor economist at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, has recently concluded that "only a small fraction of the decline 
in unionization can be accounted for by shifts in labor force structure." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, according to most recent studies, three central factors appear to 
explain most of unions' softening muscle: 
</P>
<P>
* Corporations have grown increasingly anti-union since the early 1970s. Most 
studies suggest that business has enjoyed considerable success in forestalling 
or shedding union representation through tough bargaining, unfair labor 
practices and sophisticated campaigns to tarnish labor's image. 
</P>
<P>
* Unions themselves grew complacent during the 1960s and early 1970s, devoting 
declining resources toward organizing activities and often paying less 
attention to the needs and interests of their rank-and-file members. This 
inertia has been difficult to overcome, even in a time of obvious crisis. Many 
observers inside and outside unions continue to feel that unions must undertake 
much more aggressive and sophisticated efforts to organize, seeking throughout 
the economy to win new friends and influence people. 
</P>
<P>
* Labor's problems have affected its image with non-union workers. Growing 
numbers outside organized labor believe that unions would not improve their 
wages and job security enough to be worth the effort. As a result, according to 
some suggestive data, a declining fraction of non-union members say they would 
vote for union representation if given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
If all these trends continue, some labor economists project that organized 
labor may represent less than 10% of the non-farm labor force by the turn of 
the century -- a sentence to marginality in the U.S. political economy. 
</P>
<P>
Should we care? 
</P>
<P>
Millions of workers care. Among the 17 million people who are union members, as 
far as we can tell from the available evidence, unionization provides 
significant benefits. These rewards seem evident enough that something like a 
third of all non-union members would reportedly prefer union membership to 
their present lack of representation; this makes up a segment of the work force 
amounting to roughly 30 million workers. (Even that number would probably be 
significantly greater in a less inhospitable climate.) 
</P>
<P>
Summing the two groups together, close to 50 million members of the U.S. labor 
force have a stake in the robustness of trade unions. Is that a "special 
interest"? 
</P>
<P>
An even broader segment of the public should care, I would also argue, because 
trade unions provide a salutary influence on the broader operations of the 
economy. In the era of declining union influence, U.S. firms have grown 
increasingly inclined to take advantage of a low-wage and unprotected work 
force. Compared to Japanese and European corporations, many U.S. firms are 
sluggish, able to avoid pressures to innovate and modernize because of the easy 
availability of inexpensive labor. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists argue that the United States has lost global competitiveness, 
to a considerable degree, because U.S. corporations can take advantage of, 
rather than cooperate with, their employees. These economists argue, as two 
recently concluded in a Labor Department report, that "cooperation, 
participation and trust within and across organizations are important 
determinants of the long-term performance of individuals, firms and the 
national economy." 
</P>
<P>
Could we move toward greater "cooperation, participation and trust"? A 
reinvigorated union movement would seem to be one essential ingredient of such 
an effort. But can recent trends be reversed? 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, two developments seem essential. 
</P>
<P>
First, we urgently need reform of our labor laws to level the playing field in 
the continuing contest between corporations and workers seeking to organize. As 
many as 30 million workers say they would favor union representation but are 
not now in unions. In large part that's because our labor laws allow employers 
huge advantages in organizing and election contests. The labor movement was 
shocked when the modest Labor Law Reform Act of 1978 was rejected by Congress. 
It's long past when we should get something like that legislation on the books. 
</P>
<P>
Second, and obviously essential to the first development, politicians must take 
off their blinders to which they've grown habituated in a decade of business 
domination of political discourse and recognize that what's good for workers is 
good for the U.S. economy. The savings and loan crisis is only one example of 
the consequences of rampant laissez faire policies during the reign of 
right-wing economics. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a will, we can find a way to revitalize the U.S. labor movement. In 
a future column, I'll provide further detail about legislative and political 
reforms that might help reverse the stunning and disheartening decline of 
unions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In my last column, I erred in reporting on an earlier column by Martin 
Anderson, misquoting him as saying that the recent expansion was the "longest 
ever." In fact, he had written that the duration of the recent expansion was 
approaching but had not yet equaled the length of the long 1960s expansion. 
(This error did not affect the substance of my column.) My apologies.

BILLS SEEK STIFFER PENALTIES -- INCLUDING PRISON -- FOR JOB-SAFETY VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After turning into a paper tiger during the Reagan Administration, the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act may get some teeth back, courtesy of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Three bills take separate approaches to reinvigorating OSHA: 
</P>
<P>
* A measure sponsored by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) would change employer 
violations of OSHA that result in death to a felony from a misdemeanor. Under 
current law, the maximum penalty is no more than six months in prison. The new 
proposal (S. 2154) would boost the maximum to 10 years for a first offense and 
20 years for a second. Maximum fines would rise to $250,000 from $10,000 for 
each violation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the law now contains no criminal penalty covering serious injuries 
on the job. The Metzenbaum bill would punish willful violations of OSHA that 
result in serious injury with up to five years in prison for a first offense 
and 10 years for a second. 
</P>
<P>
* Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) is sponsoring a bill (S. 490) to adjust OSHA's 
civil penalties, which have not changed in 20 years, to keep pace with 
inflation. Violators are now subject to fines of up to $1,000 for each 
violation and up to $10,000 for each "willful or repeated" violation. The bill 
would increase the maximum fines to $3,000 and $30,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
* Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has proposed legislation (S. 2442) to give victims 
of accidents in the workplace, or their families, the right to participate in 
OSHA's investigative hearing process. Currently, the sessions are effectively 
closed, and victims and their families must even pay for copies of citations 
and reports. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's and Metzenbaum's bills are the most controversial, yet both passed the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee by a strong bipartisan vote. The 
Lautenberg bill is still in committee. 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor led the fight for safer working conditions in the 1960s, which 
resulted in the creation of OSHA in 1970. The law was designed to enforce 
health and safety standards on the job through inspections and civil remedies. 
Possible criminal cases are referred to the Justice Department. But statistics 
show that few OSHA cases are sent to Justice. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, from 1983 to 1989, referrals by the EPA resulted in 520 
indictments and 400 convictions. From 1970 to 1988, there were only 14 criminal 
indictments resulting from OSHA violations, and they resulted in just 10 
convictions. No one was jailed. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can throw corporate criminals in jail for harming air, water, land and 
animals, then we can throw corporate criminals in jail for killing and maiming 
our working men and women," said Metzenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until last year, when Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole issued orders to 
step up enforcement, that the first employer was jailed for an OSHA violation 
-- 45 days for responsibility in a trench cave-in that killed a worker. 
</P>
<P>
"When you analyze the data, there is no way the political establishment can 
defend the status quo," said Joseph Kinney, who founded the National Safe 
Workplace Institute in Chicago after his brother fell to his death from faulty 
scaffolding and the employer was fined $800. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kinney's institute, the United States ranks fourth-highest out of 
22 countries in the number of deaths on the job, and a U.S. worker is 5.8 times 
likelier to die from job-related injuries than a Swedish worker. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Seminario, director of the occupational safety and health department 
at the AFL-CIO, said the toll of injuries among American workers is staggering. 
She said 10,000 workers die of injuries on the job each year, 70,000 are 
permanently disabled and 6 million are injured. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Senate hearing, Charlene Gadsen of Bridgeport, Conn., told how her 
father fell 70 feet to his death from a bridge that he had been told to 
dismantle without safety nets or ropes. OSHA has proposed fining the employer 
$20,000, but the employer is protesting the amount. 
</P>
<P>
Roxanne DeLuise of Allentown, Pa., testified about the death of her 32-year-old 
husband, who suffered third-degree burns over 95% of his body in a work 
accident. His employer was fined $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we have a Constitution that provides for life, liberty and pursuit of 
happiness when we have situations where workers have become expendable?" she 
asked in an emotional appeal that left many in the room in tears. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Metzenbaum's proposal is coming from leading business groups: the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the 
Associated General Contractors of America. 
</P>
<P>
"The OSHA statute was intended to abate hazards and resolve safety problems 
quickly," said Jeff Perlman, manager of legal and regulatory affairs at the 
chamber. "But with criminal statutes like this, the current attitude of 
cooperation between business and government would be changed to one of 
confrontation. Today almost no one asks OSHA inspectors for a warrant, but with 
Metzenbaum's bill employers would be reluctant to let OSHA on the scene if 
there has been an accident." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber has no official position on the other two pieces of legislation. 
The National Assn. of Manufacturers also opposes Metzenbaum's bill, but NAM 
lobbyist Cynthia Witkins said the group would not object to Lautenberg's 
proposal to increase civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Bush Administration has voiced support for increasing civil 
fines while opposing portions of the other two bills. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Scannell, the Labor Department official in charge of OSHA, echoed the 
chamber's Perlman in saying that the Metzenbaum proposal would make it more 
difficult to achieve compliance with the act's civil sections. 
</P>
<P>
And in a letter to Simon, Dole said the Labor Department would not support his 
legislation because OSHA has already improved its relationship with victims and 
their families through "formal administrative means." 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that improvements have been made, Simon said the rights 
of victims must be written into law to ensure that the policy is not changed 
should OSHA once again lapse into being a paper tiger.

MORTGAGE DEDUCTIONS HELP FEED THE ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan's "Deficit Fighters Eye Mortgage Interest" (July 25) should read 
"Deficit Fighters Sound Death Knell for Economy." 
</P>
<P>
If these misguided lawmakers looked past the end of their panicked noses, they 
would realize that any increase in revenue derived from limiting mortgage 
deductions would be offset by the financial trauma this would cause to our 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Think carefully about who would be adversely affected, beginning with the 
already crippled savings and loan industry and continuing to the building, real 
estate, banking and even retail sectors. 
</P>
<P>
If we are not allowed to deduct our mortgage interest in relationship to our 
taxable income levels, few people would ever be able to purchase homes, 
particularly in California where prices are so high. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer purchases spells disaster for the overall building industry, which is 
already in a severe slump across most of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster in the building industry will certainly be the final straw on the back 
of the S&amp;L industry and, of course, would also adversely effect banking 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
With fewer dollars left in our pockets, fewer dollars are spent at the retail 
level etc., etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Congress will look past the allure of immediate tax income to the 
disaster that will surely occur should home mortgage deductions be reduced or 
eliminated in any way.

U.S. COULD DO A LOT MORE TO COPE WITH OIL CRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait and the subsequent disruption of world 
oil supplies raises the long-term question: Does the United States have a 
coherent energy policy? If not, what should it be? 
</P>
<P>
 For a discussion on energy policy issues, free-lance writer Sharon Bernstein 
interviewed Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist with the Washington-based 
Institute for International Economics, who specializes in energy issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What does the embargo of Iraqi oil mean for world crude oil supplies? 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the embargo is a little unclear right now. The world has lost 5 
million barrels of oil per day, which is the production of Iraq and Kuwait. 
Such a loss in the absence of offsetting increases elsewhere could cause 
significant price increases. It could push the cost of oil to $40 to $50 per 
barrel, up from $15 in June. 
</P>
<P>
But there is uncertainty because there are several alternative sources of 
supply. Venezuela can expand production by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day, 
and Saudi Arabia by 2 million to 2.5 million barrels a day. The United Arab 
Emirates can raise production by 500,000 barrels a day at least. 
</P>
<P>
Can the U.S. government take steps to minimize the impact of the potential 
shortfall? 
</P>
<P>
The policy response of the Department of Energy has been as inept as it could 
be -- in sharp contrast with a very able performance by the national security 
agencies. The military services seem to have rapidly and successfully deployed 
enormous amounts of firepower to the Persian Gulf area in a very quick period 
of time, so far without a serious hitch. And the President has managed to 
negotiate an incredible tough set of sanctions against Iraq and got tremendous 
support by the community of nations. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Department of Energy doesn't seem to recognize that there is a 
shortage and seems to totally misunderstand the workings of the free market 
that it so strongly champions. 
</P>
<P>
There was a policy that has said we would use our strategic oil reserve early 
in a crisis. In fact, the Department of Energy has always maintained that just 
the announcement of their intention to hold an auction would be sufficient to 
depress the cost of oil. And now they're saying they won't do that. 
</P>
<P>
Does the United States have a coherent energy policy? 
</P>
<P>
No. The entirety of our ability to respond to an emergency is our strategic 
reserve. The implication from the government's action is that there is no 
problem, there is no shortage. 
</P>
<P>
As far as general policy, we have been unable to resolve or compromise between 
a number of contending different factions. The oil industry argues strongly 
that we need to open up our offshore areas and develop Alaska, and they have 
been making the same arguments since 1973. The environmentalists argue equally 
strongly that we shouldn't do that. They say we should pursue "soft path" 
solutions, like conservation and renewable energy sources. Some parts of the 
oil industry want tax incentives, even though tax incentives have been removed 
from most of the economy. And the same arguments keep being made, and the 
situation remains deadlocked. It's really very hard to see much progress in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
What are some elements that could be included in an appropriate energy policy? 
</P>
<P>
One question that always comes up is, "Should the United States be so reliant 
on imported oil?" The economist's response is that trade should not be 
restricted. But if something goes wrong, you need an insurance policy. The 
strategic petroleum reserve is an insurance policy. I'd push for a larger one. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the only thing. We also need to really try to break out of this 
impasse. We need new ideas. One of the best new ideas I've run into is the idea 
of allowing oil companies to buy used cars and claim "pollution credits" for 
getting them off the road. The oil companies could use the "credits" for other 
endeavors, and highly polluting cars that use a lot of gas would be off the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore has two policies. One is that if you're going to drive into downtown 
at certain times of day you have to buy a ticket. A user fee to drive at rush 
hour would reduce congestion on roads, and reduce pollution and gas 
consumption. Singapore also has a policy of limiting the number of cars that 
are licensed. 
</P>
<P>
What is the likelihood of a repeat of the 1970s energy crisis? 
</P>
<P>
We are right now in the first days of the worst energy crisis we have ever had. 
These things come, and then they go. They rise and they fall like the tides. 
Prices fell Wednesday back to $26 a barrel, so they were only up $11 from their 
low at the end of June. Interest in the economic side of the story is beginning 
to wane. But we could get the news in an hour that Saddam Hussein has done 
something in the Middle East and then the story could be right back on the 
front page and prices could be much, much higher. If he manages to shut down 
Saudi Arabia for a little while, we have a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
What is different now from the 1970s? Are we better prepared? 
</P>
<P>
We have all this oil in the strategic petroleum reserve, so in theory we are 
better prepared, but we haven't used it. 
</P>
<P>
How can we reduce our dependence on imported oil? 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways. One is obviously increased domestic production: Open 
the Alaska National Wildlife Area, drill off California, open up some of the 
wilderness areas. I support opening up the wilderness area, but I'm not certain 
about California. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the United States can commence to adopt measures that would encourage 
people to substitute other fuels for oil, such as natural gas and coal. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the United States could go about systematically redesigning its program 
for building nuclear power plants. The Japanese can build them in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, we can pursue the conservation option. The conservation option 
can be pursued by requiring higher efficiency standards on everything from 
appliances to buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to ensure conservation is higher prices. It's painful but we 
probably should be paying twice as much for gasoline, diesel fuel and other 
energy sources. Large energy taxes are an anathema to everybody in the energy 
business, but they are the best way of encouraging conservation, and 
conservation is one of the key things we need. 
</P>
<P>
How far along are we in developing alternative energy sources? 
</P>
<P>
We haven't come very far on alternative fuels. There's no interest. We 
certainly should have the research going into it. If we don't, we will probably 
be at the mercy of other countries' technologies. And we'll use more oil.

ROGER SIMON: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY CLUB SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About eight blocks from where I grew up there was a big country club with high 
walls. Once upon a time rich people had lived near the country club, but now 
their homes had been closed up or torn down or split into apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But the country club remained, elegant, aloof, forbidding, the entrance flanked 
by two huge towers and guarded by a wrought-iron gate. 
</P>
<P>
I never set foot inside the country club and neither did any of my friends. The 
club did not allow Jews, blacks, Poles, Greeks, Italians, or most of the other 
people who made up my neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, I had been told that only WASPs were allowed in the country club 
and, naturally, I imagined large, winged insects riding around in golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
At about this point in such narratives, the author usually states he never 
questioned the right of the country club to exclude him and his friends and 
that it was part of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, however, that I hated that country club from the first day I knew 
I couldn't get into it. We all did. It's not that we wanted to play golf. None 
of our families played golf -- it was considered a rich man's game -- and the 
public parks and beaches right next to the country club were beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
No, our anger stemmed from the fact that we and our families had been excluded, 
snubbed, made to feel like lesser people. And for no good reason. For no 
reason, that is, that we could ever change. 
</P>
<P>
We could become rich and successful. We could take lessons and buy fancy golf 
clubs and leather bags and spiked shoes. But we could never, ever become 
un-black or un-Jewish or un-Italian. 
</P>
<P>
And that is why we hated the country club. And that, it seems to me, is the 
point that some people missed when it came to the recent controversy at Shoal 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek is a country club near Birmingham, Ala., that has never admitted 
blacks. It had no formal exclusion of blacks in its rules, but it didn't need 
to. It was understood by everyone that blacks were not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek is also the site of this year's PGA Championship, an event 
broadcast by ABC and sponsored by some of the biggest corporations in America. 
</P>
<P>
Such tournaments have been held at all-white clubs in the past and are 
scheduled at all-white clubs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But the founder of Shoal Creek, Hall W. Thompson, made a terrible mistake some 
weeks ago when giving an interview to the Birmingham Post-Herald: He told the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
He said Shoal Creek would not be pressured into accepting blacks because 
"that's just not done in Birmingham." 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't done. Not in Birmingham or hundreds of other cities around 
America. Blacks weren't welcome here and Jews weren't welcome there and women 
weren't welcome over there. 
</P>
<P>
But we are not supposed to talk about this. The unwritten rules say it is OK to 
discriminate in America as long as you don't make a big deal out of it. 
</P>
<P>
But, almost overnight, Hall Thompson had made Shoal Creek's discrimination a 
big deal. While private discrimination hadn't bothered anybody for years, this 
newly "discovered" public discrimination did. Civil rights organizations 
threatened to demonstrate. IBM, Toyota, Honda, Lincoln-Mercury, Anheuser-Busch, 
and Spaulding pulled their commercials from the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
And while no golfer withdrew from the tournament, Gary Player, a South African 
who once had a drink thrown in his face by an anti-apartheid activist, did 
condemn Thompson's comments. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise was frantically sought and one was frantically achieved: The PGA 
Tour said it would prohibit future tournaments at clubs where membership even 
"raises a question" of discrimination. And Shoal Creek agreed to admit a 
66-year-old black businessman as an "honorary" member, even though he had not 
played golf in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
While honorary memberships to Shoal Creek are free, regular membership cost 
$35,000 in initiation fees. And a couple of black men in Birmingham announced 
they will seek membership. They have $35,000 and they wish to squander it in 
this manner. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the whole point. I believe blacks should be allowed to wear fuzzy, 
cardigan sweaters. I believe Jews should be able to put on bright green pants. 
I think Latinos should be allowed the privilege of standing around a locker 
room with a bunch of naked, pot-bellied, knobbly-kneed windbags for 35 grand a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
This is part of what America is all about: equal opportunity foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
That country club near where I grew up went belly-up some years ago, by the 
way. That's the thing about old money: It dies off. 
</P>
<P>
The club was taken over by the city, which now uses it to train horses for its 
mounted police force. 
</P>
<P>
So I could go back and drive through that gate and past those towers for the 
first time. And I might. 
</P>
<P>
I might just take a look at all those horses trodding on those formerly 
exclusive greens and walking on those formerly restricted fairways. And I might 
wait until one of those horses produces what horses produce in prodigious 
quantities. 
</P>
<P>
And then I might smile and reflect on the fact that while time does not heal 
all wounds, it does wound some heels.

Those wonderful black wrought-iron gates synonymous with the old Huntington 
Hospital in Pasadena have been relocated: They're now in front of the sparkling 
white entrance arbors. The impressive new Huntington Hospital complex, long in 
construction with love and affection, is about to be finished. Thus, a group 
gathered at the Valley Hunt Club to discuss Operation Celebration scheduled for 
Nov. 30. In the coterie: dinner committee chairman William Doyle, Huntington 
president Dr. Allen W. Mathies Jr., Ken McCormick and Fred Allen. The good 
doctor has even sent a save-the-date prescription for the night: "Disp: To have 
the time of your life. Sig: To be dispensed on Nov. 30. Black tie."

Hills and the store's opening at Two Rodeo Drive the week of Oct. 22. Meeting 
for "Breakfast Near Tiffany's" on Two Rodeo's dramatic Spanish Steps to the Via 
Rodeo (the first new street in Beverly Hills in 75 years), Tiffany Vice 
President Roberta Herbison and Barry Dodson, Western region group vice 
president, hosted prominents including Michael and Gretchen Wayne, Fiorenza 
Courtright, Beverly Hills Mayor Allan Alexander, Happy and Frances Franklin,

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS

<P>
With the two Germanys no longer divided, a "first-ever" pass for travel through 
East Germany can be obtained as an add-on when buying either a GermanRail pass 
or a Eurailpass. Fares are $79 for four days, $119 for eight days (or for 
travelers possessing Eurail Youth Passes, the cost is $59 for four days, $79 
for eight days). Both passes are good for unlimited travel in East Germany. To 
order rail passes, call toll-free (800) 223-6036. Additional information is 
available from GermanRail's Los Angeles representative at (213) 479-2772. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travelers are cautioned to obtain hotel reservations wherever they 
go in East Germany. What with a shortage of first-class hotels, you could wind 
up without a room. Berlin, in particular, is crowded. One tourism official told 
us: "I'd wait until next year when East Germany will be better prepared for 
heavier tourism." 
</P>
<P>

2230, Los Angeles 90071, (213) 688-7332. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany by Coach: For travelers planning a visit to West Germany, a new 
coaching tour takes in King Ludwig II country. Horse-drawn coaches leave from a 
village south of Munich on Thursdays/Sundays through October. Tours include 
transfers from Munich, meals, accommodations, an English-speaking guide. Groups 
visit two of King Ludwig's castles as well as several Bavarian villages. For 
details/prices, contact the German National Tourist Office locally or write to 
Coaching in Bavaria, R. Nermitz, Kerschlach 2, 8121 Pahl, Federal Republic of 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Leaf Peepers: Soon the highways, byways and back roads of New England will be 
crowded with travelers taking in the fall colors. To assist motorists, Vermont 
has published an eight-page guide describing 13 foliage tours. Provides driving 
instructions, mileage, etc. Covers all areas of the state. In addition, there's 
a calendar of events for September/October (craft fairs, foliage festivals, 
concerts, hayrides, art exhibits, ice cream socials, quilting bees, antique 
fairs). A total of 242 attractions. 
</P>
<P>
For an "Autumn Survival Kit," write to the Vermont Travel Division, 134 State 
St., Montpelier, Vt. 05602. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visitors are reminded that Vermont innkeepers frequently require a 
two-night minimum booking during the foliage season. A favorite of ours is The 
Inn at Wethersfield, where innkeeper Ron Thornburn plays the piano for guests 
while his wife Mary supervises the kitchen (her culinary talents are famous 
throughout New England). This old farmhouse exudes all the warmth that leaf 
peepers dream about. It's homey, informal. Candles glow of an evening while 
Thornburn performs at the piano. 
</P>
<P>
The 18th-Century, two-story inn sits back from a country lane at the base of 
Hawks Mountain between Springfield and Woodstock in southern Vermont. Guests 
have included Paul Newman and his family and novelist J. D. Salinger. The rate 
per couple is $160, including a four-course breakfast, high tea each afternoon 
and a five-course dinner. At Christmastime, the inn takes on a special glow 
when guests bundle into a horse-drawn sleigh and ride off into the woods in 
search of a tree. This is a special place -- no matter what the season.

Italian Inn: This note from Burt and Sally Clapper of Encino: "We took your 
advice and spent the last week of June at Tramonto D'Oro in Priano, Italy. We 
are genuinely well traveled and money is not a major concern. This was an 
excellent choice. The Esposito family, who are the owners of this little inn, 
were most kind and helpful. They spoke little English, but every effort was 
made toward our comfort. The food was excellent and varied and very fairly 
priced. The rooms are a bit small, but lovely balconies face the sea. The room 
price was $80 and certainly worth it. I absolutely recommend Tramonto D'Oro, 
Priano, Amalfi, Italy. It would be difficult to do better for the money." 
</P>
<P>
This little inn is south of Naples on the Amalfi Drive. Only a few miles beyond 
Positano, which was the late John Steinbeck's favorite Italian village. 
</P>
<P>
Air Fares: There are more airline fares than new car models. It gets confusing. 
And costly. Here's our advice: Book your flight as far in advance as possible. 
For the lowest domestic fares, reserve 14/21 days in advance. I booked a coach 
flight to Hawaii a couple of years ago. The fare was quoted in excess of $800. 
I asked about an advance-purchase fare. The answer: $425. Same seat, same 
plane. And a savings of $400. Suggestion: Inquire about midweek fares. Busiest 
days are Monday/Friday. Often you'll get a better break on Tuesdays/Wednesdays. 
Additional savings are available by taking a one-stop (rather than nonstop) 
flight. Ask your travel agent to explain the other options.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: BEACH VENDORS' DAY IS OVER IN ACAPULCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Street and beach vendors are a thing of the past in Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what the new law says. 
</P>
<P>
Under legislation enacted three weeks ago in the Mexican resort city, all 
peddlers have been given public work employment or afforded easy credit to 
purchase a stall at one of three flea market locations. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers looking for Mexican jewelry, crafts and souvenirs at bargain prices 
will now have to shop at one of the three flea market areas located at either 
end and midway on the main street, Carretera Miguel Aleman. 
</P>
<P>
The project has a $1-million budget that provides manual training facilities 
where ex-peddlers will learn trades and where children that have been abandoned 
can receive shelter and job training for the future. 
</P>
<P>
According to Acapulco tourism authorities, visitors will no longer see young 
children begging in the streets, or selling gum. 
</P>
<P>
Mideast Advisory: In the wake of Iraq's military invasion of Kuwait, the U.S. 
Department of State has advised Americans to postpone all travel to those 
countries and also to defer travel to Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates 
and the eastern portion of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Gain in Spain: Drift out of your lane on the autopista? Overtake on the 
wrong side near Seville? Fail to watch your speed outside Barcelona? Don't look 
for the Guardia Civil to turn a blind eye. 
</P>
<P>
Spain recently put tough new penalties into effect to curb errant motorists, 
raising fines by as much as 100% to reduce the number of accidents on the 
nation's highways. 
</P>
<P>
This is good news from a safety standpoint but bad news for travelers. Since 
they have no fixed address in the country, tourist drivers very often have to 
pay the fines on the spot. And the amounts levied are not small. 
</P>
<P>
Minor infractions can result in a penalty of up to $150. More serious incidents 
can cost up to $450, while very serious infractions can mean an instant fine of 
as much as $2,400. Failure to pay usually means the vehicle is impounded until 
the fine is paid or the matter is settled in court. 
</P>
<P>
Euphemism Alert: The following opening sentence graced the latest newsletter 
issued by the China National Tourist Office in London: 
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter of this year saw a steady recovery in China's tourism, which 
suffered a landslide following the accident last June." 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: The Mediterranean Sea covers an area of 965,000 square miles and 
has 70 cities and towns with populations of more than 100,000 along its 
28,000-mile coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Five Easy Pieces: It was London map maker John Spilsbury who invented jigsaw 
puzzles in 1762 when he mounted engraved maps on sheets of wood and cut them 
out along national boundaries to help teach geography. 
</P>
<P>
Spilsbury would be amazed to learn that his puzzling idea is now a $145-million 
industry in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the finals of the national jigsaw puzzle championships are being 
held in Athens, Ohio. Contestants compete in timed singles, doubles and junior 
contests to see who can complete previously unmarketed puzzles the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
The event at the Dairy Barn Cultural Arts Center also includes an exhibition of 
antique jigsaw puzzles, the trading of puzzles and a puzzling carnival. 
</P>
<P>
A Little About the Lot: The River Lot in France has been reopened to navigation 
after a $5.4-million renovation of its lock system. The river meanders for mile 
after scenic mile past hillside castles and caves, vineyards and limestone 
cliffs, and used to used to transport wine and cheese by barge on its way to 
Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Fallen Arches: The arches at the border between Mexico and Nogales, Ariz., will 
be torn down so that the number of checkpoints can be increased to eight, 
according to Mexico's Excelsior newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Alvaro Obregon Luken of the National Tourism Fund said a modern immigration and 
customs services building will be erected over the eight traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
He said 3.6 million foreigners cross into Mexico through Nogales each year. 
</P>
<P>
New Bite From Big Apple: Tourists and business travelers alike are returning 
from the New York City with loud complaints about the new 5% state tax tacked 
on to hotel rooms that cost $100 or more per night. The latest levy is added to 
an already existing sales tax of 8.25% and a city hotel tax of 5% plus $2 per 
room which totals approximately 20% of the hotel. That could tax anyone's 
patience.

THERE'S AN 'IN' WAY TO EXPERIENCE ALASKA SALMON FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ANCHORAGE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's fly fishing. That's for experts. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's fly-in fishing. 
</P>
<P>
That can be for experts, too, but it works real well for city people from the 
Lower 48 who would like to try catching a salmon even if they haven't fished 
since they were 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
For about $200, a plane will fly you for a day of fishing at one of probably a 
hundred lodges that dot south-central Alaska. If the price seems high, remember 
it includes a private plane flight that might cost that much anyway -- just for 
the view. 
</P>
<P>
The fly-in day-trip I took was to Lake Creek Lodge, which -- with 
accommodations for 60 overnight guests -- calls itself the largest fly-in lodge 
in the state. It is northwest of Anchorage at the convergence of the 
glacier-fed Yentra River and Lake Creek, which by Southern California standards 
is practically a river. 
</P>
<P>
The flight began at Lake Hood, which is one of the busiest airports in the 
world although it's only a pond. Float planes, as they are called here, are 
parked around the shore like cars at a drive-in. Something like one in every 50 
Alaskans has a pilot's license, so be careful to choose a licensed charter 
company. There are many. 
</P>
<P>
Once you leave Anchorage, you are suddenly out into the vast wilderness that is 
Alaska. Beneath you are miles of soggy tundra, which looks from above like a 
northern version of the Everglades with moose instead of alligators. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as we left Anchorage, I saw nothing man-made except an oil pipeline. 
Below were lakes that came in colors. Brilliant aquamarine pools caught in 
glacial ice. Brown lakes in the tundra laden with creosote and tannin. Blue 
lakes that seemed oddly ordinary by contrast. 
</P>
<P>
When the plane started down, there was nothing below but a broad river the 
color of cement, which means it carries glacial silt or finely ground rock. 
</P>
<P>
Then, all of a sudden, I saw 19 motorboats huddled together where a clear 
stream flowed into the gray water. That, of course, was right where we were 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like Hong Kong down there," the pilot said. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't what I wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no real secrets left in Alaska," said Paul Bowen, a former banker 
who with his wife, Lisa, owns the lodge. "You can fly deep into the interior 
and wherever there's good fishing, you'll find people." 
</P>
<P>
First preconception down the drain. (Along the Kenai River, where Chinook 
salmon have reached 100 pounds, lines of fishermen stand literally shoulder to 
shoulder at peak season, rhythmically casting so as to avoid tangling their 
lines.) 
</P>
<P>
My second preconception was that there is an art to fishing for salmon known 
only to experienced salmon fishermen. (While that's partially true, it's also 
true that there's an art to driving on a freeway, and there are plenty of 
people who know how to do that.) My guide, Tom Kreinheder, has led Lake Creek 
raft and fishing trips for a decade and was funny, knowledgeable and 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
On one-day fly-in trips like this, they assume you have no gear and no 
experience. They give you a boat, which you're likely to share with someone 
else, and a guide who will set up your gear for you. They also give you rubber 
boots and rain gear. 
</P>
<P>
Though the weather was indeed rainy, I didn't mind; if water couldn't reach my 
skin, then neither could mosquitoes. This has been the worst mosquito season in 
a decade. They're largely gone by August, however. 
</P>
<P>
The reason there were so many people in one place, Kreinheder explained, is 
that the fish swim dozens of miles upstream against a strong current, then turn 
at the scent of freshwater and linger in the still water just below the creek 
where they were born. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon don't eat once they leave the ocean and head upstream into fresh water 
to spawn. So you don't give them bait, you annoy them with flashy, brightly 
colored lures with BBs in them called wigglewarts. So many salmon are heading 
upstream in season that one may literally bump into your lure, lash out at it 
and chomp on your hook. 
</P>
<P>
It was a little frustrating to sit there feeling that there was nothing much 
you could do butwait for a big fish to get mad at you on his way home. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of fish were caught that morning, but our boat went into lunch 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
There are five kinds of Pacific salmon: Chinook or King salmon, Sockeye or Red, 
Silver, Pink, and Chum or Dog salmon. The Chinook come early in the season, 
from May through mid-July in most parts of Alaska, so King season is over. 
</P>
<P>
Sockeye, Silver and Pink season is in full swing now. Dog salmon begin coming 
in about mid-August. Their name comes from the fact that they are the 
traditional food for huskies. 
</P>
<P>
In most creeks there are also trout and Arctic grayling. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, we headed up into Lake Creek itself. This was more like it. A 
beautiful, clear creek with almost no people. We jettisoned our treble hooks 
for the single hook the law requires in spawning streams, and back-trolled 
along the bank, Tom at the motor. If there had been a fish in there, we would 
have caught it. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until late afternoon, when we moved back toward the river and began 
fishing in a deep, still inlet, that we started to get some bites. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, was just when the float plane landed to take me home. The only 
salmon I went home with was one Tom gave me because he's sick of eating salmon 
by now. 
</P>
<P>
As I was leaving, the lodge was filling up for dinner with people from Maine, 
Oklahoma, Washington, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Men 
and a handful of women. Good wine was being served. Salmon that had gotten mad 
at somebody's wigglewart an hour before were on the table. Home-baked lemon 
pies were laid out for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
The Sand Bar, complete with a TV tuned to a baseball game, was crowded with a 
dozen people. One group was playing poker in a corner. A woman alone could feel 
completely comfortable here. The atmosphere was convivial. 
</P>
<P>
Most people did catch fish at Lake Creek that day. If I had it to do again, 
however, I would stay three days. The fly-in one-day trip was $225. Two days 
and one night is $560, a week costs $1,690. 
</P>
<P>
Another highly recommended lodge on closer-in Alexander Creek, called Gabbert's 
Camp -- which offers a hot tub -- is $460 for two days. That sounded a little 
too "L.A." for my taste, but I bet the chlorine repels the mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
If you want total wilderness, float planes will fly you to about any lake or 
river and pick you up again. But you'll have to have your own equipment, guess 
at the fishing and pray the pilot doesn't forget where he dropped you. 
</P>
<P>
Other services leave you at sheds that contain equipment and pick you up on 
your schedule. There are also vans that will drive you to salmon rivers nearer 
Anchorage for $65. The only problem is that you spend half the day in a car. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale are lodges that can cost from $3,000 to $5,000 
per person per week. A couple of the best known are Valhalla Lodge in western 
Alaska, which offers, among other amenities, rack of lamb and crepes, and 
Chelatna Lake Lodge, which movie studios have rented for management getaways. 
</P>
<P>
Don't count on the fish being a bargain. Having your catch packed for the trip 
home can cost more than merely buying some nice little filets at Irvine Ranch 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
In all, I figured my 10-pound Chinook cost about $24 a pound.

WHERE NATURE IN THE WILD IS TOP ATTRACTION 
</P>

SEWARD, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Pam Oldow has watched visitors wipe tears from their eyes in this theater 
of nature called Kenai Fjords National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Tears of joy -- tears for the wonderful things that God created," Oldow says. 
</P>
<P>
Kenai Fjords, a 580,000-acre wonderland of glaciers, snowy peaks, whales and 
sea birds, is one of Alaska's least-known treasures. Alaska's "mainline" 
national parks -- such as Denali (featuring Mt. McKinley) and Glacier Bay -- 
are the high-volume destinations for tour operators. Kenai Fjords is mostly for 
those travelers who prefer to go exploring on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The park begins on the outskirts of Seward (Pop. 2,200), a pretty port and 
railroad town 130 miles south of Anchorage, and stretches south about 410 miles 
along the western edge of the Kenai Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Driving time from Anchorage on the Seward Highway is about three hours. The 
Alaska Railroad has daily service between Anchorage and Seward from late May to 
early September. 
</P>
<P>
The only way into the scenic heart of Kenai Fjords for most visitors is to book 
day-cruises aboard tour vessels based in Seward's small-boat harbor. Two 
operators -- Kenai Fjords Tours and Kenai Coastal Tours -- offer either 
full-day or half-day cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the park's wonders are reserved for experienced hikers on ice-field 
treks or saltwater kayakers who can handle sudden storms. The wilderness park's 
array of marine life is impressive: humpback whales, gray whales, killer 
whales, Steller's sea lions, sea otters, Dall porpoises, harbor seals and more. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the park is home to more than 100 species of bird, from bald 
eagles to clown-faced puffins. Some estimates place the puffin population at 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tour boat passengers can get within snowball-throwing distance of giant 
glaciers that sweep down mountain valleys to the sea like rivers of ice. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, evidence of the disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill is far away and 
out of sight. Only a few tendrils of crude drifted here from the spill site, 
about 150 miles to the northeast in Prince William Sound, and damage to 
wildlife was minor. 
</P>
<P>
"We still see all the animals, all the great things we've always seen," Oldow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes come swiftly, dramatically here: playful sea otters floating on 
their back in jade waters; thousands of puffins and kittiwakes whirling against 
the sky; colonies of sea lions basking on secluded islands like lazy 
vacationers; a ballet of porpoises flashing by tour boats like welcoming 
committees; bald eagles soaring on the wind currents, and, of course, the 
towering, blue-white glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
Off Cape Aialik, a pod of at least 10 killer whales -- dorsal fins slicing 
through the water like black blades -- surround tour boats like a nervous 
posse. The whales are so close that passengers can hear the tuba blasts of 
their breathing. 
</P>
<P>
A sightseeing vessel turns toward the Chiswell Islands, where dozens of 
glossy-brown sea lions are loafing on rocky platforms. Naturalists estimate the 
park's count of sea lions at about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fine summer day, time for the big bull sea lions to gather their harems 
for breeding. The males are barking and snorting. With a surge of surf, a big 
bachelor bull hauls itself from the sea and attempts to reach a cluster of 
females resting on a nearby ledge. 
</P>
<P>
The harem is being guarded by a surly bull, scarred from many battles. The 
intruder slips on mats of wet kelp draped over the cliff and slides back into 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead, thousands of sea birds -- tufted puffins, horned puffins, 
black-legged kittiwakes, common murres and gulls -- are wheeling and swooping 
by their island rookeries. The sky is so filled with birds that at times they 
almost blot out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"And this is nothing unusual," Oldow proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
All eyes -- and cameras -- are on one plump puffin, so overloaded with a 
seafood lunch that it is unable to lift off the water. Wings beating, the bird 
bangs down the briny runway like a crippled airliner, then aborts the takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
But Kenai Fjords is more than wildlife. It also is a showcase for some of 
nature's most violent forces. 
</P>
<P>
Moist air billows off the Gulf of Alaska and restocks the park's 
300-square-mile Harding Icefield with 35 to 65 feet of snow each year. Then the 
snow is pressed and shaped over time into glaciers that flow down from the ice 
field like giant bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the seaward ends of the Kenai Mountains are slipping into the sea, 
being dragged under by tectonic collisions far below the waves. Alpine valleys 
that once cradled glaciers thus become deep-water fiords in a few ticks of 
geological time. 
</P>
<P>
One of the national park's great attractions is Holgate Glacier, a massive wall 
of ice that towers hundreds of feet over the sightseeing boats. Its 
tidewater-washed face is a savage mass of icy swords and crevices glowing with 
blue-white fire. 
</P>
<P>
Tour vessels approach cautiously, dodging stray bergs hurled into Holgate Arm 
by the glacier's constant "calving." 
</P>
<P>
We are lucky today. There are sharp reports, like rifle fire, as ice across 
Holgate's snout cracks from incredible pressures deep inside the glacier. Then, 
with a thunderous roll, mighty slabs of ice fall into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But the show isn't over yet. High above, on a vertical cliff, a frisky young 
mountain goat dashes across the rocks in a perilous traverse. The kid slips and 
begins what looks to be a fatal tumble. Passengers gasp. 
</P>
<P>
In the blink of an eye, the mother goat moves down slope and breaks the fall. 
It was as if the nanny had anticipated the youngster's foolish fun.

CRUISE VIEWS: A NEW SHIP FOR ALASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JUNEAU, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newest cruise ship sailing Alaskan waters is the 960-passenger Crystal 
Harmony, built in Nagasaki, Japan, for Los Angeles-based Crystal Cruises at a 
cost of $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel offers 12-day round-trip cruises from San Francisco along the Inside 
Passage, with calls at Victoria and Vancouver in British Columbia, and Haines, 
Juneau, Ketchikan, Sitka, Skagway and Wrangell in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers can take shore excursions that include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Helicopter flights over glacial rivers of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rides aboard the wooden parlor cars of a historic narrow-gauge railway that 
once carried supplies to the Klondike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inflatable raft trips into the Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve near Haines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flights in a bush pilot's floatplane over the fiords. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fishing trips in search of salmon off Ketchikan. 
</P>
<P>
These excursions cost from $15 to $168 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Crystal Harmony offers three dining choices. In addition to the Crystal 
Dining Room, which has two seatings, passengers can dine free in one of the 
ship's two specialty restaurants: Prego, which serves Italian cuisine, and 
Kyoto, which offers a variety of dishes from many Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
The ship offers the first seagoing branch of Las Vegas' Caesars Palace, with 
six blackjack tables, a craps table, a roulette table and about 75 slot 
machines. News-hungry passengers can receive Cable News Network by satellite 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
The highest ratio of public space per passenger, lots of private verandas, 
generous expanses of teak decking, a sliding glass roof over a pool and deck 
area, 24-hour room service and in-cabin dinners add to the voyage's comfort and 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's decor is rich and luxurious, with marble, wood and brass used 
throughout. Pianists, harpists and violinists continually fill the ship with 
music, and 526 staff members in custom-designed uniforms seem to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The public room most successful is the Palm Court, an expanse of polished wood, 
ceiling fans, rattan chairs and potted palms arranged below conical skylights 
like a Victorian conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment on the ship is slick and professional, featuring musical 
productions and such performers as magicians and marionettes. 
</P>
<P>
Largest accommodations are the 948-square-foot Crystal Penthouse suites, with 
private verandas, whirlpool tubs, wet bars, separate living and bedrooms, entry 
foyer and guest half-baths, which cost $950 to $1,200 per person, double 
occupancy, per day. Nineteen spacious inside cabins, meanwhile, cost $245 per 
person per day, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Deluxe outside staterooms come with or without private verandas. Since they are 
all comparable in size and furnishings -- king-sized or twin beds, sofas, 
built-in desks with chairs -- those without verandas seem more spacious and 
have somewhat larger closets. There are also four well-designed cabins for 
handicapped passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The best buy on board appears to be the standard outside stateroom with 
portholes, which are somewhat larger than the deluxe outside staterooms with 
windows, but cost about $255 a day per person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Decks No. 7 and No. 8 contain about 98 deluxe cabins with views partially or 
fully obstructed because of hanging lifeboats. Prices for these are about $275 
to $285 a day. All cabins have bathtubs, hair dryers and safes. 
</P>
<P>
After the last Alaska cruise of the season, which departs Aug. 29, the Crystal 
Harmony will sail south to the Mexican Riviera (from San Francisco Sept. 10 and 
Los Angeles Sept. 11) for a series of 10-day Panama Canal transits between 
Acapulco and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

HIKING / LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST: LOS PADRES LAND MAY BE RENAMED TO HONOR 
CHUMASH INDIAN GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chumash were the largest tribal group in California at the time of explorer 
Juan Cabrillo's arrival in 1542. Occupying the coastal and inland territory 
from Malibu to San Luis Obispo, the Chumash enjoyed the bounty of both land and 
sea. They had a complex village and religious life, as well as a practical and 
mystical astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
A small portion of the Chumash's ancestral land is currently proposed for 
designation as a wilderness area within Los Padres National Forest. Congress 
approved HR 1473, sponsored by Rep. Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), which would 
preserve about 36,000 acres of pine forest and juniper woodland, grasslands and 
badlands. 
</P>
<P>
Two differing bills in the Senate -- S-1625 (sponsored by Alan Cranston) and 
S-2784 (sponsored by Pete Wilson) -- would also set aside a Chumash Wilderness 
of this or, in the case of Cranston's bill, greater size. 
</P>
<P>
As the bill makes its way through various legislative committees, the Chumash 
Wilderness boundaries are sure to be adjusted by the political process. If 
action is not taken by September, when legislators adjourn, the bill will die 
and likely be reintroduced in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
One thing conservationists and politicos alike can agree upon: The name Chumash 
Wilderness will be an improvement over "Sawmill-Badlands Further Planning Area 
No. 134," as the U.S. Forest Service calls this land. 
</P>
<P>
It's quite a land to hike, to behold. Although just 75 miles northwest of Los 
Angeles, it seems much, much farther from the metropolis. After a day of hiking 
across the broad shoulders of Mt. Pinos, highest peak in Los Padres National 
Forest, you start to get some inkling of why the mountain was so sacred to the 
Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time we honor the Chumash," said Sally Reid, a Sierra Club activist who 
has been leading the charge for wilderness designation. "This land, highest in 
Los Padres National Forest, center of the Chumash universe, is very special." 
</P>
<P>
Reid is certain the land is of wilderness quality. "It has high mountains with 
clear-day views from the High Sierra to the Pacific, it has examples of 
ecosystems from alpine down to high desert, as well as remarkable badlands 
unlike any in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed wilderness has much diversity. A cool pine-and-fir forest covers 
Mt. Pinos and a couple of its more than 8,000-foot neighbors. Mt. Pinos is a 
great place to cross-country ski during winter and to hike during the rest of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight is Quatal Canyon, a kind of Bryce Canyon-in-miniature, 
complete with dramatic pinnacles and weird, eroded rock formations. Scientists 
are fascinated by the canyon because it is rich in vertebrate fossils, 
particularly from the Miocene Epoch (12 to 16 million years ago). 
</P>
<P>
Quatal Canyon has been proposed as a Natural National Landmark, a federal 
designation by the Secretary of Interior that recognizes outstanding examples 
of ecology or geology and helps to preserve them. 
</P>
<P>
Another area of interest to scientists is San Emigdio Mesa, a large, flat 
alluvial fan forested with pinyon pine and dwarf oak. The 1,200 acres of pinyon 
pine woodland is by far the most extensive of its kind in Southern California, 
and recalls some of the mesas of the Great Basin. 
</P>
<P>
For the hiker, the new Chumash Wilderness offers two major trails. One is the 
popular six-mile, roller-coaster-like path between Mt. Pinos and Cerro Noroeste 
(Mt. Abel). This trail offers a fine trek over sub-alpine slopes, the highest 
in Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is a five- or six-mile round-trip hike from Quatal Canyon 
Road to Quatal Canyon for a close-up view of the badlands. This is a good hike 
in cooler months, when snow covers the nearby high peaks. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult trail, today's hike begins in a high pine forest but passes 
through other ecosystems -- pinyon-juniper woodland, chaparral and grassland -- 
as it descends from Mt. Abel to Toad Spring Camp. It's a great introduction to 
the lay of the land, a fine overview of the proposed Chumash Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
One word of warning: The second half of this hike uses Toad Spring Trail, 
which, much to the consternation of conservationists, the Forest Service 
designated in 1976 as a motorcycle route. Because of current drought and fire 
danger, the Forest Service has closed the Toad Spring Trail to motorcycles, but 
not to hikers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness status for this area means that Toad Spring Trail would be closed to 
motorcycles and revived as the footpath it was prior to 1976. Though it's not a 
particularly popular motorcycle trail, and it's currently closed to such use, 
the concerned hiker may wish to contact the Mt. Pinos Ranger District for the 
latest trail update. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: This trip requires a car shuttle. Hikers will want to 
depart from the Mt. Abel trailhead and arrive at the Toad Spring Campground 
trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
From Interstate 5 in Frazier Park, exit on Frazier Mountain Park Road and head 
west. The road, which becomes Cuddy Valley Road, continues to a Y-junction. The 
left fork leads to Mt. Pinos, but you stay right and join Mil Potrero Road. 
</P>
<P>
Drive 8 1/2 miles to Cerro Noroeste Road and turn left. Proceed seven miles to 
the signed trailhead, half a mile below the summit of Mt. Cerro Noroeste (Mt. 
Abel). Parking is not plentiful right at the trailhead, so park in a safe 
manner along the road. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cerro Noroeste Road/Mil Potrero Road junction, continue right (west) 
on the latter road, which, to make matters confusing, takes on the name Cerro 
Noroeste Road. Travel a mile to the signed turnoff for Toad Spring Campground, 
turning left on Forest Road 9N09, continuing three-tenths of a mile to the 
camp, then another four-tenths of a mile to the unsigned trailhead on the left 
(south) side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Leaving signed Mt. Abel trailhead, the path descends very steeply for 
half a mile down a draw into a forested hollow. Here there's a signed junction, 
with (incorrect) mileages for the trail leading left (southeast) to Mt. Pinos. 
</P>
<P>
Bear right on unsigned Mesa Spring Trail and descend past huge and widely 
spaced ponderosa pine. Scattered among the pines are silver fir, some of which 
are large enough and pretty enough to be the White House Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
After a mile you'll pass through a gate (the Forest Service allows some cattle 
grazing on this land). The path descends through a mixed transition forest of 
pine and oak. The area has unusual botany. Inhabitants of dry lands -- coffee 
berry and manzanita and scrub oak -- mingle with sub-alpine species: pine, fir 
and snow plant. 
</P>
<P>
The path drops a couple more miles through pinyon pine country to Mesa Spring 
Camp, at an elevation of about 6,000 feet. It's a simple trail camp with picnic 
tables and water. A hundred yards from camp is a huge watering trough used by 
bovine forest visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa Spring, Mesa Spring Camp and Mesa Spring Trail are named for San Emigdio 
Mesa, the pinyon pine-covered territory visible as the path leaves camp. Stay 
right at an unsigned trail junction just below camp and continue walking for a 
couple miles on a flatland between the mesa on your left and the tall shoulder 
of Mt. Cerro Noroeste on your right. 
</P>
<P>
At a (poorly) signed trail junction, you'll join Forest Service Trail 22W01, 
Toad Spring Trail, which leads northward 3 1/4 miles to Quatal Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The trail climbs and dips over pinyon pine- and juniper-dotted slopes. There 
are grand views west and south over the proposed Chumash Wilderness and of the 
Cuyama Badlands to the northwest. Best view of all is the view right below of 
Quatal Canyon. The pinnacle rock formations resemble those in southwest Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Toad Spring Trail, seriously eroded by motorcycles in some places albeit 
passable, skirts the rim of Quatal Canyon. The last mile of the trail marches 
steeply up and down some minor hills before reaching its terminus (or 
trailhead, depending on how you look at it) at Quatal Canyon Road.

CONSUMER REPORT: TURNING HOLIDAY TOUR INTO A MOVABLE FEAST; 
</P>
<P>
DINING: TRAVELERS HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS TO CONSIDER WHEN SETTING UP THEIR MEAL 
PLANS FOR OVERSEAS GROUP TOURS. PREPAYING SAVES MONEY, BUT LIMITS YOUR CHOICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning your meals when you're part of a group tour headed overseas has 
budgetary and geographic -- as well as culinary -- considerations. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, prepayment of meals can save money. Tour operators also may 
offer optional meal plans, which is one of the ways to avoid a consistent 
regimen of hotel food. 
</P>
<P>
However, information on these optional dining programs is often skimpy, and 
consumers should explore the subject thoroughly before investing their money. 
Generally, these optional meal plans must be purchased prior to departure from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't always realize how remote their surroundings may be at the hotel 
they stay in," said Chuck Winn of Brendan Tours in Los Angeles. "There may not 
be much of a choice on where to eat. This can be particularly true in some 
parts of the South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Misconceptions about cost also come into play. "Some travelers balk at buying 
optional meal plans and then discover how expensive meals can be overseas," 
said Winn. "They have no idea of the real prices of meals overseas." 
</P>
<P>
"In some countries around the world, tour groups may possibly get a more 
Americanized menu at hotels," said Don Lorenzini, the Western region director 
for General Tours. 
</P>
<P>
"However, this depends on the country. In the Soviet Union, you still get local 
cuisine, but in other parts of Eastern Europe, the trend with newer hotels is 
for more standard and Americanized meals for tour groups." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the trend is the notion that chefs abroad have about 
American dining habits. 
</P>
<P>
"Hotels often do try to provide meals that Americans will be comfortable with," 
said Dawn Suart, vice president of operations for Olson-Travelworld in Los 
Angeles. "Americans are less likely, as a rule, to be adventurous or want 
exotic cuisine." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when you're on a tour, you may get similar meals on successive 
nights, though at different hotels. "You often get the standard chicken or 
banquet dinner when you're eating on a table d'hote basis with a group," said 
John Hemphill, president of Glendale-based World Travel Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you understand in advance whether your meals will be provided table 
d'hote or a la carte. With the former, you're limited to a choice of dishes, 
while with the latter you can choose anything on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee or tea are often included with the meals, while wine and beer are 
generally extra. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are used to water with their meals, but overseas, water may not be 
served," Winn said. "And if you request water, you're likely to get a bottle of 
mineral water, which you'll be charged for. It depends on the tour operator 
whether this charge is part of your meal or not." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, will you get a full breakfast that includes at least one hot dish? 
Or is breakfast strictly continental-style? Are meals served buffet or 
sit-down? 
</P>
<P>
Most tours offer table d'hote dining. Options can vary between two and three 
entrees; in other cases, just one entree may be available. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the more structured the meal plan, the lower the price. With the 
lesser tab comes less choice about where, when and with whom you dine. Try to 
find out whether you'll be dining in the same area as other hotel guests or in 
separate areas such as banquet rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Dine-around plans are an option with some upscale tour operators. There are 
several variations, all of which allow guests to break loose from the group and 
eat independently. 
</P>
<P>
Some plans permit eating at any restaurant in the city, anytime and whatever is 
on the menu (though some limitations might be placed on more expensive items 
such as caviar or lobster). 
</P>
<P>
The usual procedure is to bring your receipts back to the tour manager and get 
reimbursed in the local currency. "The refund would be in a strong currency," 
Suart said. "We wouldn't give someone rupees on their last day in India." 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that you keep your receipts and receive reimbursement 
from the tour operator after returning to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some dine-around plans may offer a la carte dining, but only at specific 
restaurants in the city. "There may also be special hours you can dine at these 
restaurants, as well as special menus," Hemphill said. 
</P>
<P>
The plans generally exclude alcohol with meals. Service charges are included, 
but if you tip extra, that's your expense. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the questions consumers should ask is if their dine-around plan permits 
them to use the hotel's room service," said Suart. 
</P>
<P>
Though this type of meal program provides more latitude in dining, it costs 
more than the programs offered at hotels where the tour operator, as with 
accommodations, can get some sort of volume discount. And you can count on the 
cost of meals in a dine-around plan being structured into the cost of the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"We track the cost of meals at restaurants at each city on our itineraries," 
Hemphill said. 
</P>
<P>
Meal vouchers is another method used by some tour operators. Find out if any 
refunds are offered if you dine for less than the amounts the vouchers are 
worth. Generally, there are no refunds; if you eat for more than the voucher is 
worth, you pay for the extra amount. Service charges/tips may be up to you, so 
lay aside extra money in your budget for this expense. 
</P>
<P>
Vouchers are usually offered on a table d'hote basis, though there may be some 
that allow you to order a la carte. 
</P>
<P>
If you're on a package where two meals are included, one way to save money on 
the third meal is to find a restaurant where locals eat and to look for 
specials of the day. Ask your tour guide, the hotel concierge or front-desk 
personnel for suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, this unscheduled meal is the chance for travelers on escorted 
packages to separate themselves from the group and explore cities on their own.

The captive dolphins at the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa may not believe they are in 
paradise, but rather in paradise lost. 
</P>
<P>
They were removed from family members and their native habitat. They are 
subject to disease and stress (two of the dolphins at the Waikoloa have already 
died), and their life span is considerably shortened due to their captive 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing educational nor of any scientific merit gained by penning 
these intelligent animals in a hotel situation.

I know from reading his columns that Jerry Hulse is not too fond of 
mega-resorts in general. I personally love them and luxury hotels of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
As a complete surprise, I absolutely hated the Hyatt Waikoloa. For one thing, 
as stated in his article, I also thought it reminded me of a cheap amusement 
park. It's definitely overdone, bordering on the ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
The major problem is that there is a serious design flaw that made me feel 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
There is a terrible claustrophobic feeling about the resort, an awful feeling 
of being trapped in a maze. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, whether walking, riding the stupid tram or the boat on the 
canal, one doesn't feel a connection to the outside world. I felt simply stuck 
among the maze of fauna and jungle growth. I heartily agree with Hulse this 
time.

We frowned but will accept Jerry Hulse's description of our resort as "gigantic 
and expensive." On our size, we need all this space to offer all the activities 
we do and still ensure none of our guests are crowded or disturbed in whatever 
they care to do. 
</P>
<P>
About our expense, no question about it, we are not cheap. Yet, we absolutely 
live by the phrase: "You get what you pay for." If for any reason a guest does 
not believe he or she has received the value for the money spent, our entire 
staff is trained to rectify the situation immediately. 
</P>
<P>
There is one characterization we take absolute exception to. Again we quote: 
"It is representative of other mega-resorts that are out of touch with the old, 
unspoiled Hawaii, the fragile beauty of which is rapidly disintegrating -- 
along with a culture and gentleness of its people that was so special to these 
islands." 
</P>
<P>
We built the beach on our man-made lagoon because we did not remove one rock 
from our natural lava shoreline. We continue to preserve the same ancient 
petroglyphs outside our front door as each of the Kohala Coast hotels take 
pride in doing. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the fragile beauty of the land you accuse us of disintegrating: We 
are the first and, to my knowledge, the only resort on the island of Hawaii to 
recycle its garbage. It should be added that only because of our size are we 
able to afford the expense of recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, regarding the lost culture and gentleness of our people. On behalf of 
the 2,100 employees of the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, most of whom have lived 
their entire lives in Hawaii, I defy you to find a group of people, anywhere in 
the world, who takes greater pride in practicing its culture and who is more 
genuine, friendly and dedicated to service. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hulse may prefer smaller, quaint resorts to our alternative, which is his 
prerogative. But please don't confuse your preference or our size and array of 
activities with a lost commitment on our part to the three most basic elements 
that make Hawaii the greatest destination on earth: our water, our land and our 
people. We have not lost touch with that reality.

Jerry Hulse's article on old Hawaii is full of interesting items that cause a 
person who has been to Hawaii to make sure the Big Island is the place to visit

I just hope the area around and in Holualoa is not run over by speculators and

Glacier basics: With the exception of the Glacier Bay cruises, you can schedule

Unless you want full-scale cruise ship amenities with loungers on deck, look

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While U.S. and Philippine negotiators ready for another round of talks on 
America's military presence here, at no other time in recent memory have U.S. 
military personnel played such a visible role in restoring calm to the troubled 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Americans based at the largest U.S. military installation 
outside the United States have helped put down a coup attempt that almost 
toppled the Aquino government, launched dramatic rescue missions in the 
aftermath of the July 16 earthquake and played a vital role in typhoon-relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials strenuously avoid playing up these events, the past 
year has brought strong reminders of how dependent the Philippines has become 
on about 40,000 U.S. military representatives stationed at permanent 
installations at Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and four smaller facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Vivid television pictures of U.S. servicemen pulling survivors from under the 
rubble at Baguio are sure to be etched in the minds of people here when the two 
countries resume negotiations for a new bases agreement later this month or 
early September. The current agreement allowing the U.S. military installations 
in the Philippines expires in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
To some, the U.S. bargaining position never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
"The earthquake definitely improved the climate for the negotiations," said 
Philippine Rep. Jose de Venecia, a prominent member of the Joint 
Legislative-Executive Bases Committee. "This was a shining moment in America's 
role in the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
Media reports frequently speak of how the 400 U.S. servicemen from Clark were 
the first to arrive in the mountain resort city of Baguio with 55-bed mobile 
hospitals, supplies and equipment. In comparison, the Philippine military 
arrived late and appeared disorganized, Western diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising number of letters to the editor in local newspapers and columns 
have drawn a link between the U.S. participation in earthquake relief efforts 
and the bases debate. Coming on the eve of the most important phase of bases 
negotiations, in an eerie sort of way the disaster came at a time when Uncle 
Sam needed a way to prove his usefulness to ordinary Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority approved of our assistance in the coup attempt and they are glad 
we did what we did. The same holds true for the earthquake," said a U.S. 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the same feeling is echoed throughout typhoon-ravaged Manila -- 
where spray-painted signs with such slogans as "No to U.S. Bases" compete for 
space with gaudy Filipino movie billboards -- is uncertain. This is still a 
land where people see U.S. conspiracy theories behind most events, such as the 
recent withdrawal of the U.S. Peace Corps -- seen as a ploy by Washington to 
exert pressure on Manila ahead of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the debate over retention of U.S. bases has been wrapped up in an 
emotional web of arguments ranging from the threat the bases pose to Philippine 
sovereignty to how much the U.S. should pay for using some of the most coveted 
pieces of real estate in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts predict that the highly visible U.S. involvement in putting down 
the December coup and the quick U.S. response to the earthquake could influence 
the undecided members of the Philippine negotiating team -- lead by Foreign 
Secretary Raul Manglapus -- to drop its hard-line posturing. 
</P>
<P>
National pride will heavily influence thinking on the Philippine side of the 
negotiating table. In a recent interview, President Corazon Aquino, who has 
studiously avoided spelling out her position on the issue, said the presence of 
the bases has stalled her country's efforts to achieve full sovereignty. "It's 
a matter of our national sovereignty and territorial integrity," she said. "In 
any country where there are foreign bases on native soil it does create a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Aquino raised hopes of U.S. officials, saying she wanted the talks 
finished within five months. 
</P>
<P>
When the two sides sit down together to hammer out an agreement, the Philippine 
side is in no position to dictate terms. Filipinos may have already overplayed 
their hand in earlier negotiations by demanding exorbitant rent for base lands 
and placing unrealistic demands on negotiators. The Philippines wants at least 
$360 million for use of the two installations. (The Bush Administration has 
responded with a request to Congress of $220 million in 1990, but is not 
expected to come up with more than $160 million.) 
</P>
<P>
What's more, before coming to the negotiating table earlier this year, 
Philippine officials failed to acknowledge the potential huge economic 
dislocation of removing the bases, which employ 78,000 Filipino workers. One 
aide to Aquino described the embarassing Philippine approach as 
"stick'em-up-guy diplomacy." In recent months, Aquino's government seems to be 
clinging to power and defending itself against charges of inaptitude. Rumors of 
coup attempts, frequent power outages, water shortages, charges of corruption 
and a frightening economic decline have combined to transform Malacanang Palace 
into a crisis-management center. Last week, troops in the Philippines were put 
on full alert following rumors of a fresh coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Washington may not have to look hard for convincing arguments to bargain down 
the compensation fee for the bases. More than ever, Manila may not be willing 
to risk the loss of large amounts of critically needed American foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling at the moment that the U.S. should not be given carte 
blanche for their own purposes in the Philippines," said De Venecia. 
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is the author of a popular proposal that would transfer Philippine 
bases now situated on valuable land in Manila to either Clark or Subic, under a 
generous agreement giving the United States until the year 2000 to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by the Philippine Bases Council in February, also calls for 
Manila's congested Ninoy Aquino International Airport to be moved to Clark, 
about 60 miles north of Manila. Both moves could generate billions of dollars 
for the cash-strapped government and free up tracts of land for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best possible option for the Philippine government," De Venecia 
said. "It is designed to usher in a new era of friendly relations between the 
Philippines and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
If the Philippines adopted such a strategy, it would shift the emphasis from 
the money factor to planning a withdrawal that would minimize disruption to the 
economy and prevent acute political embarrassment to the government. A 
phased-out withdrawal also means America would not be placed in the 
uncomfortable position of saying an abrupt goodby to a long-time ally. 
</P>
<P>
Once the two sides reach an agreement, it could still be scuttled by lawmakers 
in the United States. A bizarre provision in the Philippine constitution 
stipulates that the bases agreement must be ratified not only by the Philippine 
Senate but by the U.S. Senate as well. U.S. officials say they much prefer an 
executive agreement, but the Philippine feeling is that the Senate's imprint 
would give it the full force of an international treaty. 
</P>
<P>
But this should not cause undue worry to U.S. negotiators. Said one senior 
official close to Aquino, "The United States always gets what it wants around 
here. There is no doubt that there will continue to be some U.S. presence after 
1991."

SADDAM HUSSEIN'S EXALTED IMAGE: EVERY PICTURE MUST BE HIS

<P>
So far President Bush is getting high marks for his management of the Persian 
Gulf confrontation with Saddam Hus sein. Nonetheless, until Iraq abandons its 
control of Kuwait -- unlikely until Hussein is ousted -- the President's 
credibility will be on the line. If there are military encounters and loss of 
U.S. lives, Bush will face tough times. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq was part of my turf when I served on the National Security Council staff. 
To understand the current crisis it is useful to recall how U.S. relations with 
Iraq evolved. Until recently, Iraq was viewed as a possible partner to work 
with the United States for a more stable Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
When Hussein invaded Iran in 1980, the United States took a neutral position. 
U.S. hostages were being held in Tehran and it made sense not further to 
exacerbate U.S. relations with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Even after the 
hostages were released, the war was of little concern. 
</P>
<P>
However in 1982 the Iranian army achieved some important victories over Iraq 
and seemed poised to bring about the collapse of the Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
There was panic throughout the Persian Gulf. If Iraq fell, Khomeini's armies 
would be a few hours from Kuwait and the entire region would be at the mercy of 
a religious fanatic. It was fear of this geopolitical catastrophe that caused 
the United States to begin its steady tilt toward Iraq. By November, 1984, full 
diplomatic relations were established. Administration officials had many 
conversations with Iraqi officials and were hopeful, when the war ended, for a 
new cooperative era in U.S.-Iraqi relations. 
</P>
<P>
But the war continued for four more years. And U.S.-Iraqi relations suffered a 
devastating blow with the 1986 disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair -- and that 
the United States had sent weapons to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, communications were frosty. While the United States continued 
tacitly to support Iraq by the arms embargo against Iran, video tapes of Iraq's 
use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish civilians, and Iraq's accidental 
missile strike against a U.S. ship, put Washington on notice. Yet, given the 
ferocity of the war, Iraq's behavior could be explained as that of a 
beleaguered country, fighting for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as suddenly as the war began, it ended in 1988 -- with a series of 
stunning Iraqi military victories. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no love lost for Hussein in Washington, Iraq was viewed as 
an important Arab country that might serve U.S. interests. This was because 
Iraq's closest allies against Iran were Egypt and Jordan -- two of America's 
closest allies in the region. Iraq had also taken a more moderate position on 
the Palestinian question. Perhaps Iraq might now become a positive force for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there were the extraordinary efforts Iraq took after the war to 
rebuild its damaged regions -- hardly the behavior of a belligerent power. On a 
visit to Basra, in spring, 1988, I was impressed with the sense of mission that 
most Iraqis expressed about their hopes for the future. In comparison to other 
Arab countries, Iraq has a literate population, women are integrated into the 
work force and there is relative religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
But there was another side of Iraq that made any visitor uneasy: the 
ever-present pictures of Hussein -- he has a personality cult unrivaled 
anywhere in the world, except possibly in North Korea. He stared from every 
billboard, shop, restaurant, government office, on buses and carts and every 
day, without fail, on the front page of all the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
On this visit I was taken to Baghdad's art museum to see Impressionist 
paintings, only to be told I would instead be privileged to see a new exhibit 
about to open. I was informed that for the past year every artist in Iraq had 
been urged to paint a portrait of Hussein. I was to see the top 400 selected 
for showing. 
</P>
<P>
It was amazing. Hussein in every conceivable military uniform -- army, navy, 
air force, commando, jet pilot; in Kurdish costume; as a child, as a teenager 
and as a young man; with dark glasses, displaying a distinctly Riviera look; at 
prayer. There was even one painting of Hussein in a tuxedo. I was enthralled by 
this display of what Malcolm Muggeridge calls "the dungeons of the ego." 
</P>
<P>
The mistake most people made in misjudging Hussein was to assume that, because 
Iraq had been through so much suffering and had such high expectations for its 
future, his illusions of grandeur would be curbed. Kuwait, then, is paying for 
this mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But could Hussein's wings have been clipped earlier? I doubt it. Bad as some of 
his previous deeds were, they were not sufficiently outrageous to galvanize the 
international community. 
</P>
<P>
That has changed. Like all power maniacs, Hussein has been doomed by his own 
ambition. It may take time for him to fall, but his advisers must now realize 
the invasion of Kuwait was a blunder unparalleled in recent Arab history. 
</P>
<P>
When Hussein is gone, Iraq will still be a powerful Middle East country. Its 
geography, oil, military resources and population assure that. The horrendous 
impact of demography and economic hardship in most Arab lands will not 
disappear and resentment of the oil-rich Arabs will not end. The Palestinian 
problem will again appear at the top of the agenda. Until such fundamental 
problems are addressed with the urgency now devoted to Hussein, another radical 
Arab leader will emerge to take his place.

Q: HOW MANY U.S. DEFENSE LABS DESIGN MISSILES? A: TOO MANY;

<P>
DEFENSE: EACH BRANCH OF THE ARMED SERVICES HAS RESEARCH LABORATORIES TO DESIGN 
WEAPONS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GETTING BETTER DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Early last month, the University of Texas at Austin held the grand opening 
ceremony for a private research center to explore ways the U.S. Army can use 
high-speed guns to blast through tanks and launch satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a great idea. 
</P>
<P>
It is. 
</P>
<P>
But the Army already has research teams studying these weapons. So do the Air 
Force and the Navy. Each of the armed services has its own multimillion-dollar 
program to design these powerful cannons and test them on high-tech firing 
ranges. But that's only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of concentrating resources on a handful of promising technologies, 
hundreds of military research programs struggle along. Researchers complain 
that they never get enough time or money to do the job right. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to more than one fiasco. About 10 years ago, an Army laboratory 
attempted to design camouflage fatigues that could repel the heat of a nuclear 
blast. Instead, scientists were forced to surrender to the power of hot water. 
The fatigues shrunk so much that the soldiers could not walk and the sleeves 
shrunk up to their elbows. The uniform disaster and other research center 
bloopers are the result of a system gone haywire. Common sense is sorely 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of redundant efforts going on in the military laboratories and 
research centers. Taxpayers are footing the bill for nine government centers to 
design guided missiles, eight that work on lasers, 15 conducting medical 
research, eight exploring environmental issues and six studying psychology. And 
that is the Defense Department's own tally. Add to that an enormous number of 
smaller projects that overlap. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines all fly helicopters and all 
plan to shoot guns and missiles from them. But instead of concentrating work on 
those guns and missiles in one place, it is scattered in half a dozen states. 
During the 1960s, the armed services invented 12 different fuses to set off 
bombs. By 1970, people in the defense secretary's office told the military to 
quit the nonsense and pick one fuse. They forced the armed services to share 
many helicopter weapons. That rarely happens anymore, partly because it's such 
a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been tough to persuade the four services to buy the same weapons. 
They argue that their needs are so different, they cannot possibly agree on one 
gun or airplane. While the Air Force worries about buying a fighter plane that 
is light enough to dart and dodge in a dogfight, the Navy needs planes sturdy 
enough to be catapulted from a carrier deck and sturdy enough not to corrode in 
the salty sea air. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is plenty of unnecessary duplication, particularly in the area of 
research. The Pentagon spends $8 billion a year on 68 laboratories across the 
country that are supposed to invent everything from lightweight helmets and 
indestructible pouches of frankfurters and beans to tiny bombs and treatments 
for serious burns. In the past, government laboratories were responsible for 
such engineering feats as the atomic bomb, jet engines and powerful radars. 
During the Vietnam War, for instance, 85% of the missiles used by U.S. forces 
were products of China Lake, the Navy's weapon research center near Death 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Defense Department now has nine research centers studying bombs and 
missiles, one might assume the results would be much more impressive. But they 
aren't. The Army tinkered for nearly 20 years with a missile that shoots out of 
a cannon and bursts open in the air, unloading a stream of baby bombs with 
parachutes (the soldiers call them bomblets) to rain down on tanks. It's a 
complex system because the bomblets are supposed to figure out where the tanks 
are instead of blowing up bushes. Finally, the Army made it work. But the Air 
Force is not too interested. Its researchers are still trying to tackle this 
technology on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has even had conflicts within its own ranks. Two decades ago, when the 
chief of the Army's tank center was trying to find a way to help his troops 
fight in the dark, three research teams proposed solutions. All were designing 
similar equipment in different laboratories. What's more, they had no idea 
others were working along the same lines. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a matter of national security, but rather lack of coordination and 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a new technology is in demand, military research teams jump into the 
fray. That is how the United States ended up with nine missile laboratories in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Missile research began during World War II, when Germany invented a pilotless 
airplane, the V-1 buzz bomb. The Germans filled it with fuel and sent it toward 
London. When it ran out of gas, the buzz bomb crashed, blowing up anything it 
hit. Although it was not sophisticated, the V-1 and its successor the V-2 
demonstrated a whole new way of fighting. U.S. scientists were scrambling to 
come up with their own buzz bombs when the war ended. Once peace broke out, 
money for such research dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1957 the Soviets shocked the world with Sputnik. U.S. researchers were 
working on their own world-circling spaceship, but Sputnik disgraced them. The 
bad guys were ahead and the United States had to catch up fast. Suddenly, money 
was no object. Rocket and missile centers sprung up everywhere. No one wanted 
to be left out. As a result, funding was spread across all the missile 
projects. That still happens. 
</P>
<P>
Even the supervision of the research facilities is spread out and duplicative. 
Redundant layers of management are set up to ensure that no one is stealing 
taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers lose out anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive regulations turn simple tasks into bureaucratic nightmares. One 
research director had to assign someone on his staff to work full time for four 
months just to fill out the forms needed to order six desktop computers. Then 
it took more than a year for the computers to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials know the military laboratory system is not 
working. Dozens of studies over three decades have discovered the same 
problems. A 1962 report prepared for Defense Secretary Robert McNamara revealed 
excessive paperwork and a 1968 review found duplication in military research. 
Early this year, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney set up a task force to 
consolidate the research centers. That effort, however, is bogged down in its 
own bureaucratic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been told to devise a comprehensive plan for closing and merging 
research centers. The task is almost impossible. The Navy is not about to give 
up its own research facilities and trust the Air Force to design all the 
missiles and the Army isn't about to trust either one. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem crazy to open a private research center in Texas when the Defense 
Department is trying to close its own laboratories. But the military's own 
centers are so deeply entangled in red tape and the annual struggle for funding 
that they have little time to create anything. 
</P>
<P>
Since the electric-gun research is considered to be an important element in 
shaping future armed forces, the only way to ensure productive research is to 
conduct it outside the government laboratories. Scientists in Texas will 
perform only a fraction of the paperwork foisted upon military researchers. 
Even better, they won't have to waste a lot of timeand energy fighting with the 
other services.

PAC PARANOIA: CONGRESS FACES CAMPAIGN SPENDING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HYSTERIA WAS THE OPERATIVE WORD WHEN LEGISLATORS REALIZED THEY COULD 
NOT RETURN HOME WITHOUT TOUGHER CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Democratic aide explained recently why senators were so eager to pass 
legislation tightening federal campaign-finance laws. "Everyone is hysterical," 
the Senate staffer said. "They want to pass a bill. No matter what is in it." 
</P>
<P>
Hysteria, however carefully concealed, aptly characterizes how members of 
Congress from both parties have recently handled a host of problems related to 
an increasingly toxic and controversial mix: Setting and enforcing rules on the 
connection between money and politics. 
</P>
<P>
The frantic haste by both the Senate and House to pass campaign-finance bills 
in the final days and hours before they began their August recess gave the best 
evidence of the volatile financial-political brew. On display were both the 
politicians' continuing fears of the problem, real or perceived, of 
special-interest money and their unwillingness to make the fundamental changes 
required to reduce the influence. 
</P>
<P>
In the current political climate, many lawmakers feared going home without 
being able to tell their constituents that they had confronted the 
special-interest groups. But they were wary of causing self-inflicted wounds by 
cutting off the sources of campaign money on which they have become so 
dependent. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Democrats' plan passed, 59-40, over the objection of all but five 
Republicans, after months of back-room negotiations. It would impose voluntary 
spending limits pegged to a state's population, give reduced broadcast and mail 
rates as incentives to candidates who agree to abide by the limits and ban 
contributions from political-action committees (PACs). The level of hypocrisy 
matched the hysteria. The Senate Democrats' agreement to the PAC ban and a 
reduction from $1,000 to $250 in the ceiling on campaign gifts from 
out-of-state contributors triggered strong objections from agitated party 
insiders. These monetary sources, have been far more important to Democrats 
than to Republican candidates, who raise more of their funds in smaller amounts 
by mail. 
</P>
<P>
GOP senators, for their part, said that they opposed the Democratic demand for 
spending limits. That change, they said, would benefit incumbent senators, most 
of whom are Democrats, and would be detrimental to lesser-known challengers who 
must spend more money to spread their message. But the Republican claim 
sidesteps the fact that because nearly all incumbents raise far more than do 
their challengers, a spending limit could help to level the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
Although House Democrats also included a spending limit, their package differed 
significantly from that of their Senate brethren. The House bill preserved 
PACs, setting a $275,000 ceiling on the total that a candidate could raise from 
them. That limit exceeds the amount that more than 300 House members raised 
from special-interest groups in 1988. The House bill also failed to restrict 
large, out-of-state contributions which, according to campaign-finance experts, 
are more likely to be given in exchange for influence-peddling. The most 
egregious aspect of the House charade came when a more sweeping Democratic 
version initially passed on a voice vote, partly with the help of silent 
Republicans who opposed the stiffer version. Embarrassed Democrats quickly 
regrouped and defeated the "good-government" version, 122-128; 158 members, 
mostly Republicans, voted "present" to protest each version. 
</P>
<P>
In both the House and Senate, members were willing to pursue the partisan 
imperative because they were confident Bush would fulfill his promise to veto a 
campaign-finance bill with spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
A week before the Senate passed the campaign-finance bill, it voted to denounce 
Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) for violating Senate rules limiting outside 
income and restricting the use of a home-state condominium. Although the vote 
was 96-0, the debate prompted heated exchanges on the standards for proper 
financial behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators nearly jumped down each other's throat as they discussed the 
committee's investigatory procedures in the Durenberger case. "I was not 
present during the public hearing but I watched it on TV," said Sen. Don 
Nickles (R-Okla.) "I did not really see a special counsel (in charge of the 
investigation.) I saw a prosecutor. And it bothered me." Sen. Warren Rudman 
(R-N.H.) heatedly responded on behalf of the Ethics Committee: "It is offensive 
to me personally to have Robert Bennett (the special counsel) referred to that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Paying rapt attention, though not participating, on the Senate floor were the 
"Keating Five," the senators -- including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) -- accused 
of seeking regulatory favors in exchange for campaign funds from Charles H. 
Keating Jr., the discredited and bankrupt savings-and-loan boss. The Ethics 
Committee may issue preliminary rulings in their case next month. 
</P>
<P>
Most senators have little to say publicly about the Keating case. But they are 
well aware of the potentially damaging impact on the senators under 
investigation. Like Durenberger, none of the five face reelection this November 
and they are attempting to carry on with business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
A mood of hysteria also has increasingly surrounded the onset of this 
November's election. Many lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans, have been edgy 
lately as they prepare for a fall campaign in which "incumbent" may be a 
nine-letter political synonym for "scum." 
</P>
<P>
Politicians have abundant financial problems to answer for in this fall's 
campaign: the catastrophic S&amp;L mess; the federal deficit and, lest we 
forget, the 25% pay raise that House members voted themselves last fall after 
rejecting a 50% boost. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, members of Congress understand that they have been part of an 
institutional failure to respond to real problems. In the past, most of them 
have been able to keep their distance, as individuals, from these hot wires. 
The difference in 1990 may be that voters are demanding accountability and 
seeking culprits. 
</P>
<P>
Pollsters from both parties have found a drop of roughly 10%, when they ask 
voters whether they are inclined to reelect incumbents. Most lawmakers will 
survive this year if only because few face opponents who are even semi-credible 
or have adequate financing. But both parties are gearing up for surprise 
election setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
This atmosphere helps to explain why one of the most popular political 
activities these days is the lineup of nervous incumbents, in a modern-day act 
of expatiation, returning their contributions from savings-and-loan executives. 
Whether their new-found purity removes their earlier sins will be up to the 
voters.

PRESIDENT BUSH SENDS TROOPS TO SAUDI ARABIA

<TEXT>
<P>
One idea about the "Butcher of Baghdad" dilemma: Don't kill a lot of civilians, 
etc. Don't even think of committing American ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
Simply station our carriers off Iraq and use missiles alone. What would be the 
target: Very simple -- Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
We certainly know where his haunts are. We certainly have some kind of 
intelligence inside Iraq. Wherever he goes, wherever he intends to go, blast it 
with a big warhead. I'd be willing to bet he would get real nervous in a short 
time, as Libya's Moammar Kadafi did. Think of the millions of people who would 
have been saved if we could have eliminated Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Did I hear someone say it's not right to engage in personal assassinations? To 
that I reply that being killed or injured is just as personal to the young men 
now sailing toward harm's way because of this ruthless, unfeeling nut.

PRESIDENT BUSH SENDS TROOPS TO SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to the Iraq invasion, the clamor toward a military solution appears 
to have coincided with the Senate vote on the military budget for fiscal 1991. 
I propose that we cut military spending down from $289 billion to $250 billion, 
and use the remaining $39 billion to create a solid alternative energy program. 
</P>
<P>
That's the real solution to this problem. As long as we're an oil-dependent 
country we're at the mercy of the fanatics who control it. 
</P>
<P>
And I hate to see this country's leaders join in the fanaticism instead of 
confronting the real issue -- oil dependency. It's up to the taxpayer to stop 
this outrageous military spending ASAP and insist on an alternative energy 
program now.

BETTER DEAL FOR POLITICAL REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Central Americans, who make up 80% of those seeking asylum in the United 
States, Immigration and Naturalization Service policies have often seemed a 
double standard: Nicaraguans, seeking asylum from the Sandinista regime that 
was fighting U.S.-backed Contra rebels, were regularly welcomed. But those 
fleeing violence in U.S.-allied El Salvador and Guatemala, for example, were 
usually refused sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials must currently follow State Department assessments of whether a 
refugee's fear of persecution in the home country is "well-founded". This 
screening method has sparked charges that the process is too politicized. 
Indeed, in order for the State Department to acknowledge political persecution 
and rights abuses under U.S.-supported governments, it must sometimes 
contradict its own foreign-policy assessments. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding past U.S. asylum practices was highlighted by the 
1986 trial and conviction of U.S. church workers on charges they illegally 
housed refugees in churches. The defendants, activists in the so-called 
Sanctuary movement, sought to publicize what they saw as the misguided ideology 
of American refugee policy. 
</P>
<P>
Critics may be assuaged by newly announced INS methods of determining which 
petitions should be granted. The effect of the new guidelines could be 
especially noticeable in Southern California, one of the principal ports of 
entry for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The changes will include the appointment of 70-90 investigators who will 
receive special training in asylum law and on the conditions in 
refugee-producing countries. The new asylum unit needn't rely on State 
Department evaluations of refugees' fears and instead can use documentation 
from such organizations as Amnesty International. Also, a refugee no longer 
will need to prove that he or she has been targeted for persecution. Instead, 
INS investigators will decide whether a petitioner's story is plausible, given 
the patterns of oppression in the home country. 
</P>
<P>
If rigorously embraced, the policy changes will be a laudable step closer not 
only to world asylum standards but to a realistic system for coping with the 
burgeoning flood of would-be U.S. immigrants.

FROM LINKS TO BOARDROOMS, DOORS ARE CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIANNE MALVEAUX, Julianne Malveaux is a syndicated columnist in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Joe Lowery, 
announced it would boycott the Shoal Creek Country Club in Birmingham, Ala., he 
said, "To cooperate with evil is to affirm it." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery must have been gratified by the response to his condemnation. Corporate 
sponsors of the 1990 Professional Golf Assn. Championship threatened to reduce 
their financial participation in the tournament because Shoal Creek seemed to 
discriminate against blacks. So Shoal Creek invited a black man to be a member. 
There was figurative cheek kissing, warm fuzzies passed out all around. And 
there will be no boycott. 
</P>
<P>
The acceptance of one black man to "honorary membership" in the Shoal Creek 
golf club is a baby step in the giant war against institutional racism. Indeed, 
some of the very sponsors who said they'd not be part of a discriminatory 
tournament are probably part of some other discriminatory activity. Their 
corporate boardrooms probably look no different than the Shoal Creek locker 
room -- white, male and unapologetic until those who are raising questions put 
financial muscle behind their queries. 
</P>
<P>
Few golf clubs have written rules that exclude blacks, but of the 25 clubs that 
will host future U.S. Golf Assn. or PGA tournaments 16 do not have black 
members. Similarly, most corporations say they are equal opportunity employers, 
but few have blacks in senior management. Golf clubs exclude blacks and other 
minorities by requiring that two or three members provide references for 
prospective members. There are rarely two or three to be found to bring color 
to a club that was once all white. 
</P>
<P>
This is nothing but the old boy network hard at work again. It encourages and 
promotes people who look and act so much like each other that eye contact is 
not much different than a glance at the mirror. It is friends and friends of 
friends, keeping doors closed to protect their turf. They can write down the 
rules, but if the laws change they can remind themselves, in the words of Shoal 
Creek's founder, Hall W. Thompson, that black membership in their private clubs 
"just isn't done." 
</P>
<P>
But the members of these white male clubs often claim their memberships as a 
tax deduction, and say they use their clubs to do business. All of us pay for 
their segregated membership, pay for them to stand at the first hole and 
whisper those three magic words, "Let's do business," into a colleague's ear. 
Because few, if any, of their colleagues are people of color, the doors to the 
boardroom have been as firmly slammed as the golf links have been closed. And 
as dollars trickle away from our tax coffers to subsidize rites of white male 
bonding, all of us pay for the way the doors slam.

THE SINNERS CAST STONES AT IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S. RECORD RIGHTLY MAKES US HYPOCRITES IN THE EYES OF MANY THIRD WORLD 
NATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In these days of national unity and high moral purpose against the monstrous 
Saddam Hussein, variously depicted by cartoonists as a spider ("Iraqnaphobia!) 
or Hitler or both, it is salutary to remember that a good many people in the 
Third World regard the United States as singularly hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the sudden rediscovery by U.S. politicians and commentators of the 
United Nations as a splendid body, emblem of mankind's most virtuous 
aspirations. In a not untypical editorial, on Aug. 6, the Boston Globe 
announced "The U.N.'s coming of age," saying that with the three resolutions 
against Iraq's aggression passed by the Security Council, "the United Nations 
may finally achieve the lofty status its founders sought 45 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
What that fine phrase "coming of age" actually means is that for once the 
United States and the rest of the world were in step. In years when this has 
not been the case and the United States was in a minority in the Security 
Council and the General Assembly, then the United Nations was denounced here as 
a "Third World talking shop," sadly short of lofty status. 
</P>
<P>
Being essentially a mouthpiece for the state, the American press has mostly 
managed through the last decade to overlook the degree of isolation of the 
United States from the rest of the world. To take some examples: In June, 1986, 
the World Court condemned the United States for its "unlawful use of force" in 
mining Nicaragua's harbors, in supporting the Contras and in conducting illegal 
economic warfare. The court ordered the United States to stop violating 
international law and to pay reparations. Congress promptly voted $100 million 
for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, the U.N. Security Council passed, 11 to 1 with 3 
abstentions, a resolution calling on the United States to observe international 
law. The United States vetoed it. Nicaragua than went to the General Assembly, 
which voted 94 to 3 (United States, Israel, El Salvador) calling on the United 
States to comply with the World Court ruling. In 1987, at the time of the 
Washington summit and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, the U.N. General 
Assembly voted 154 to 1 with no abstentions to oppose the buildup of weapons in 
outer space. It voted 135 to 1 against the development of new weapons of mass 
destruction. In both of these cases the United States cast the lone negative 
vote. The American press was mostly silent. 
</P>
<P>
In the same session, the General Assembly passed a resolution condemning 
"Terrorism Wherever and by Whomever Committed." The vote was 153 to 2, with 
Honduras abstaining. It's not hard to figure why the United States and Israel 
objected, since the resolution contained the statement that nothing in it 
"would prejudice the right of peoples, particularly those under colonial or 
racist regimes, or under foreign occupation or other forms of domination, to 
struggle for self-determination, freedom and independence, or to seek and 
receive support for that end." When Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism, he did 
so within the terms of that U.N. resolution, which all NATO countries except 
the United States supported. No doubt that language would today appeal 
particularly to the emir of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
To take one final example, in January the Security Council voted 13 to 1, with 
Britain abstaining, to condemn the sacking by U.S. troops of the residence of 
the Nicaraguan ambassador in Panama. No talk then about the lofty U.N. ideals. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, when the world disagrees with the United States, the world is crazy. 
All through the 1950s, when the United States controlled the place, the United 
Nations was extolled as the locus of visionary statesmanship and the Soviets 
were reviled for their vetoes. Disgusted talk about Third World domination came 
later, in the 1970s and 1980s, when the boot was on the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
It's this shifting posture that strikes folks out there, particularly in the 
Third World, as peculiarly hypocritical. One day Saddam Hussein is the West's 
bulwark against the ayatollah, the next he's evil incarnate and openly invoked 
in the press as a worthy target for assassination. 
</P>
<P>
So, yes, Hussein is getting a good deal of support inside the Arab world from 
people infuriated at the double standard. "What did they (the United States) do 
to stop the (1982 Israeli) invasion of Lebanon," asked a Palestinian computer 
programmer quoted in a report in the London Times. "What have they done about 
the bloody occupation of the West Bank?" The answer is that the United States 
has done nothing. 
</P>
<P>
So, as the escalation of a U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia begins, we 
may as well be clear about the dominant opinion in the region -- of people in 
the streets, not terrified sheiks or U.S. client states -- about the moral 
credentials of this proud upholder of the rule of law.

By MICHAEL SBAITA, a Fullerton businessman who emigrated from Kuwait 12 years 
ago, commented on Iraq's annexation of his native country. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not (optimistic that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein will withdraw from 
Kuwait). The occupation is totally unacceptable. It's an aggression -- brutal 
aggression -- and it has to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is a very rich country, a very helpless country. Therefore, it does 
require outside protection. However, outside protection is not always easy to 
swallow, because that means outside intervention. And it's not the easiest 
thing to accept other forces in your land, on your border -- even if it's for 
your own protection. So it's really a Catch-22 kind of game. You have to do 
something, but you don't know exactly what to do because in this matter, there 
is no appropriate thing to do. Everybody is hoping for protection; everybody is 
seeking protection. 
</P>
<P>
Indirectly, everybody is blessing the American decision to interfere, even 
though down deep inside, we wish we never had to. 
</P>
<P>
I hope to see Iraqi troops withdrawing from Kuwait very soon and normal life 
restored, without a need for any kind of wars.

LOS ANGELES AND THE MEMORY OF MANY HOPES;

20TH CENTURY LOS ANGELES POWER, PROMOTION AND SOCIAL CONFLICT EDITED BY NORMAN

By Bill Boyarsky, Boyarsky is a Times columnist. He has written two biographies 
of Ronald Reagan and, with co-author Nancy Boyarsky, a book on local government 
corruption, Backroom Politics.Real estate advertisement from the Los Angeles 
Sunday Times, April 6, 1902. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles has always wrapped itself in myth. An example is the myth of a 
healthy environment. Trying to boost tourism and weak real-estate sales in the 
late 19th Century, Los Angeles business promoters advertised the Southland as a 
health paradise. Actually, the city's filthy water supply brought typhoid 
epidemics during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
That 19th-Century self-deception is one of the myths cited in this valuable 
collection of seven essays that show how boosters, politicians and just plain 
residents always have preferred a fuzzy, pleasant, fictional version of the 
area's history to its more gritty and distasteful reality. 
</P>
<P>
The book was published at an opportune time. Los Angeles is creating another 
myth: prosperous, happy, multiethnic, multicultural capital of the booming 
Pacific Rim. The reality is different. Areas of Third World poverty blight the 
prosperity. There's plenty of tension in our rich new mix of ethnic groups. And 
the Japanese might argue about our claiming capital status. 
</P>
<P>
As editors Norman M. Klein of the California Institute of the Arts and Martin 
J. Schiesl of Cal State Los Angeles put it: "Los Angeles is entering a new 
epoch, and is being forced to reexamine its priorities, even the fantasies it 
promotes." 
</P>
<P>
A central reality in the book is the racism that always has accompanied life in 
what's been advertised as a suburban paradise. The subdivisions that sprung up 
in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys after World War II gave ex-GIs and 
their contemporaries a house of their own. But not everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Lonnie Bunche's essay on "The Afro-American in Los Angeles Since 
1900" is a photograph of one of those early tracts, with the sign "This Tract 
Is Exclusive and Restricted." Restrictive covenants trapped Afro-Americans in 
an increasingly overcrowded ghetto along Central Avenue. Attempts to move out 
were resisted by whites. "As conditions worsened, racial violence occurred on 
the streets of Los Angeles," writes Bunche. White students rioted at Fremont 
High School in 1941 when black students enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria E. Miranda's "The Mexican Immigrant Family" shows how the racist 
policies of the Los Angeles Unified School District deprived the Latino 
community of a generation of leaders. Another by Carlos Navarro and Rodolfo 
Acuna notes the difference between the activist Latino political community in 
San Antonio and Los Angeles' much weaker Hispanic politics. 
</P>
<P>
A huge immigration from Mexico during the 1910 Revolution and civil unrest of 
the '20s swelled Los Angeles' Latino population. The immigrants, many of them 
from the country, worked in menial jobs. Neighborhoods were wiped out by 
redevelopment backed by Anglo politicians and developers. The school system 
shunted the immigrants' youngsters off to vocational courses. "Without a 
professional base upon which to build community leadership, second-generation 
Mexican-Americans had little hope for a better life in this society," Miranda 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a generation of leaders was lost helps explain the political and 
economic weakness of the Latino community. Past racism continues to shape 
today's Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Exclusion led to violent protests. Some uncomfortable Anglos wondered why these 
militants couldn't be more like the Asians, the "model minority." That 
sentiment, masking a deep strain of anti-Asian feeling in Calfornia, is 
examined in the essay "Asian-Pacific Angelenos: Model Minorities and 
Indispensable Scapegoats" by Donald Teruoa Hata Jr. and Hadine Ishitani Hata. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian-American past was shaped by bigotry -- anti-Asian immigration laws, 
the destruction of Chinatown for construction of Union Station, the 
imprisonment of Japanese in detention camps during World War II. Racism toward 
Asians declined after the war, but, as the authors note, it's returning. "With 
many Americans out of work, a severe trade balance and our descent to 
debtor-nation status, there is a need for a scapegoat," they write. "The litany 
of loathsome epithets and propaganda images from our wars in Asia (from World 
War II to Korea and Vietnam) are circulating again. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Some of the essays are weak. I thought the piece on the Los Angeles Police 
Department, criticizing its police-state intelligence gathering, failed to take 
note of the great popular support the LAPD has in the neighborhoods. An essay 
on organized crime has too much Bugsy Siegel, Mickey Cohen and other mobsters 
of the faded '40s. And if there's a second printing, it should catch some 
editing errors, such as a misspelling of the name of one of the Southland's 
favorite gangsters, Tony Cornero, who ran gambling ships off Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
These are small criticisms. The book is a well-needed dose of realism to mark 
the region's entrance into the many-cultured society of the Pacific Rim. The 
message of the essays is that Los Angeles residents, and policy makers, must 
deal with the reality, rather than view the new L.A. with the misty-eyed 
enthusiasm of spectators at the Olympics arts festival.

THE FOLKS THAT LIVE ON THE HILL BY KINGSLEY AMIS (SUMMIT BOOKS: $18.95; 246 
PP.;0-671-70816-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Merle Rubin, Rubin is a frequent contributor to the Book Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each new novel by Kingsley Amis -- and this must be at least his 20th -- 
generates an automatic shock wave among outraged leftists, a predictable round 
of ovations from conservatives and their fellow-travelers, and murmurs of 
grudging respect from brow-beaten soi-disant liberals whose literary standards 
are evidently so debased that Amis' bumbling, heavy-handed ironies look like 
rapier thrusts of wit to them. 
</P>
<P>
To leftists (and, more recently, to feminists), Amis' curmudgeonly, xenophobic, 
homophobic, misogynistic views are simply anathema. Cultural and political 
conservatives either agree openly with these attitudes or take the more 
discreet tack of commending Amis for his refreshing ability to cut through 
"cant" (cant, as used by this persuasion, invariably means left-wing -- as 
distinguished from right-wing -- twaddle). One feels sorriest in all this for 
the befuddled middle-of-the-road reviewers, who feel vaguely uncomfortable 
about Amis' attitudes, but constrained to admit that he is a very good writer 
all the same, a great wit, an elegant stylist, and a scathing critic of modern 
mores. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely how Amis has achieved his current reputation as a writer to be 
reckoned with is an intriguing subject it would take too long to tackle within 
the limited scope of a book review. Some day, perhaps, someone will undertake a 
serious re-evaluation of his whole novelistic career, from "Lucky Jim" (1954) 
on, and find him, I would suspect, one of the most overrated writers of the 
postwar period. But this is a task that requires more fortitude and stamina and 
greater tolerance for undiluted tedium than this reviewer had left by the time 
she had dragged herself through the final pages of this not-very-long but quite 
interminable-seeming book. 
</P>
<P>
"The Folks That Live on the Hill" introduces us to the little world of Harry 
Caldecote, a retired librarian, who lives in the "Shepherd's Hill" section of 
London. Harry is surrounded by a cast of distantly related misfits who serve as 
outlets for his patronizing concern and barn-door-sized targets for Amis' 
shafts of thick-skulled wit. 
</P>
<P>
Harry lives with his sister Clare, a sensible, understanding woman who puts up 
with him as neither of his ex-wives has been able to do. Clare is intended as 
an exemplary woman: Even when she permits herself to tell Harry the occasional 
home-truth, she still defers to him, as his wives did not. 
</P>
<P>
Harry's brother Freddie is a pathetic, watered-down version of Harry, wedded to 
an oppressively devoted woman called Desiree. Shielding Freddie from Desiree's 
constant attentions is one of Harry's helpful hobbies. Harry has a 
ne'er-do-well son called Piers, who's always extracting money from friends and 
relatives. And, though his wives have abandoned him, his first wife's niece 
Fiona, an alcoholic nymphomaniac, is on hand, in dire need of continual rescue, 
and his second wife's daughter Bunty also is around to provide a certain amount 
of drama as her ex-husband Desmond and current lesbian lover Popsy vie for her 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
Feminists may breathe a sigh of relief, if they like. The dreadful Desiree is 
shown to have at least a tiny glimmer of decency in her concern for Freddie; 
and although Popsy is a nasty caricature of a "butch" lesbian, Amis -- and 
Harry -- view Bunty's lesbianism as an acceptable life style. What's truly 
repellent about this novel is not so much its political outlook as its sheer 
insufferability as a piece of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Plowing through pages of sloppily written prose, the reader will search in vain 
for any trace of the much-vaunted style that supposedly compensates for the 
disagreeable subject matter. A random sampling yields passages such as this: 
</P>
<P>
"He had remembered as a boy reading in an encyclopedia where it had said that 
for every word in the Bible a million other words had been written on the 
subject -- on that of the Bible as a whole or in some part, presumably, rather 
than on each successive word of its text. A tough one to shoot down, had been 
an early thought of his on the point, followed not so many years later by a 
supplementary to the effect that in the human or material sphere the nearest 
comparable disparity was between the number of words that women said and the 
number that would have to have been said about what they had said in order to 
produce a full or clear or straight account of any matter." 
</P>
<P>
The sheer dead weight of verbiage in these two sentences is symptomatic of 
padding on a much larger scale. The story line is nothing more than a series of 
set-piece scenes in which Harry and/or his sister Clare cope with the 
predictable nuisances in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery of lovable and not-so-lovable misfit relatives is a lifeless 
collection of characters without character. The humor, mostly at the expense of 
"pretension" (which for Mr. Amis means preferring pate to Bovril),consists of 
limp squibs delivered in a relentlessly jaunty manner best described as a kind 
of petit bourgeois aping of aristocratic complacency. 
</P>
<P>
A key to what's wrong with this novel is, ironically enough, presented in a 
scene in which the alcoholic Fiona tells of how she tried to write a story 
called "Getting Nowhere," only to find that there was nothing she had to say: 
"Not nearly enough for a book, unless you filled it up with all falling 
downstairs and stealing and getting arrested. Padding," she muses -- an all-too 
apt description of the novel in which she finds herself. 
</P>
<P>
One has the dismaying sense as one reads that there's no point at all to this 
novel; it is merely another piece of hack work churned out on the assembly line 
of one of Britain's last exporting cottage industries. Harry's brother Freddie 
recalls a sad admission made decades ago by their father when he was still 
alive: It was not that the book he was reading was boring -- he had become, he 
admitted, a bore himself. But the writer bored with his writing is even more 
likely to produce a boring book than the reader bored with his reading. 
Kingsley Amis is, quite evidently, a bored writer.

<P>
BOHIN MANOR BY TADEUSZ KONWICKI; TRANSLATED BY RICHARD LOURIE (FARRAR, STRAUS

By Wanda Urbanska, Urbanska is a Virginia-based author and journalist who has 
traveled extensively in Poland. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his latest book in English translation, "Bohin Manor," Tadeusz Konwicki -- 
one of Poland's most celebrated postwar writers -- steps back in time to the 
19th Century and in form to the conventional narrative. 
</P>
<P>
With America's heightened interest in Poland during the 1980s, Konwicki managed 
to publish a stunning string of provocative, prophetic books here: "The Polish 
Complex" (1982), "A Minor Apocalypse" (1983) and "Moonrise, Moonset" (1987), 
each having appeared four to five years earlier in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Bouncing between reality and fantasy, optimism and lament, laced with the 
vagaries of contemporary Polish life and the deliberately intrusive presence of 
a narrator (often as not Konwicki himself), these imaginative pastiches are 
hard to characterize and even harder to put down. Each different yet somehow 
organically connected, they powerfully and painfully evoke Poland's turmoil as 
it lived up to and through the fitful Solidarity and martial-law periods, which 
hastened the collapse of the ailing Communist Soviet Empire. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bohin Manor" -- first published in Poland in late 1987 -- Konwicki makes a 
conscious departure from these weightier works and tries his hand at what he 
has called "a lighter book." "After I've struggled with a million things which 
surround me which I'm trying to work out, I tried to write a book, just a good 
read," Konwicki told me in Warsaw during a 1987 interview for the Los Angeles 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Konwicki sharpened the analogy William Styron has made in "Sophie's Choice" and 
elsewhere between Poland and the American South by comparing Polish Lithuania 
after the failed January, 1863, uprising to the post-Civil War American South. 
" 'Gone With the Wind' could have been written in this old historical 
Lithuania," Konwicki said. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with keen anticipation that I approached "Bohin Manor," an 
expectation that made the sting of its failed promise all the more painful. Not 
that this book is poorly conceived or that his straying into a more 
conventional form should be held against him. The problem is this: Stripped of 
all the many portentous rumblings of troubles past and future among the 
Lithuanians and the Russians, the Poles and the Jews and the Germans, the 
peasants and the nobility, stripped of all the heavy-handed symbols about the 
impotent, imperiled state of the Polish-Lithuanian gentry in the last third of 
the last century, the romance feels forced and falls flat. 
</P>
<P>
Set in 1875 in a Lithuania still smarting from the failure of its insurrection, 
the novel opens as Konwicki's fictional grandmother, Helena Konwicka, 
celebrates her 30th birthday, spotting outside her window an omen that signals 
her release from the emotional captivity of her widower father's home. "All of 
a sudden there was a flash of light -- as if from summer lightning . . . Maybe 
it was a sign. A sign for me alone. But from whom?" Konwicki writes on the 
third page, none too subtly pointing the reader toward the locus of change. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Helena's eminently eligible suitor, Count Alexander Broel-Plater 
-- who is pressing to set a wedding date -- leaves her cold, and whispers among 
the servants suggest that women do nothing for him, either, that this pampered 
mama's boy wants marriage in order to fulfill a codicil in his father's will. 
</P>
<P>
Enter onto the scene -- literally, he steps in front of her carriage in the 
middle of the road -- Elias Szyra, a sexually magnetic, red-headed "Jew boy 
from Bujwidze" who has mysteriously carried the torch for Helena for 12 years 
while traveling the globe, and who served in the insurrection out of unrequited 
love for her. 
</P>
<P>
The contest between Szyra and Plater is too facilely staged by Konwicki, 
negating tension and interest in what should be the novel's central drama. 
Almost every time Plater appears at Bohin, Szyra is there, too, providing 
Helena and the reader with only a black-and-white contrast. Where Plater is 
restrained and controlling, Szyra is wily and passionate. In one scene, Plater, 
who has broken his leg improbably by running into a pine stump, arrives for 
medical help at Bohin, where Szyra, also present, comes to the rescue as a 
self-appointed physician. 
</P>
<P>
It could be argued that the drama was intended to be played out in Helena's 
mind; if so, her feelings can be too easily read from the start. "She made an 
effort to think about Plater and the distant past, so that crazy Jew from 
Bujwidze with the cold fire around him would not come slipping out from any 
nooks and crannies in the dark." Characteristically, Helena's choice is amply 
foreshadowed. Early on, for the first time, the virginal Helena strips and 
floats "shamelessly naked" in the river near her home. And, heaven help us, 
after the risky love affair is consummated, storks appear from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the supporting figures -- all too heavily laden with their baggage -- 
do little more than weigh down the story. Michal, Helena's father, remains so 
caught up in the failed uprising that he never speaks in public but only 
screams out in the middle of the night and administers beatings to himself. 
Schicklgruber, the strange monster of the forest -- who, we are informed by 
translator Richard Lourie in his introduction, "burns and devours people alive" 
-- will come to be known in the next century as Adolf Hitler. Stalin, Lenin, 
Pilsudski, Mickiewicz and Pushkin appear as well in this landscape crowded with 
historical personages. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolism can enhance a compelling story, bringing further life to it, but 
symbols alone cannot carry a story that is weak at its core. Part of the reason 
this fine novelist has floundered is that he never convinces us that he knows 
enough about everyday life in 19th-Century Lithuania to transport us there. 
Though he makes frequent references to his grandmother's demanding work, 
Konwicki never spells out her chores: "Helena began mentally reviewing the 
day's tasks. There were a lot of them, exactly the same as yesterday's, and 
tomorrow's, too." Is she churning butter of doing petit point? The reader wants 
to know. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone familiar with Konwicki, it should come as no surprise when the 
author pops up in the text, this time as the soulful grandson searching for his 
lost grandmother. "I am working my way through the back streets of time," he 
writes, "through the numbness of the imagination, through my own river of pain, 
and I must make it to that other shore, to my grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
It is sad indeed that Tadeusz Konwicki, who has succeeded so admirably in 
showing readers around the world the Poland of today, has failed to shed the 
same light on the exotic, lost world of 19th-Century Lithuania. Perhaps his 
next work will return him to provinces in which he is more sure-footed.

THE ETERNAL COMBAT OF HAN AND JONG; 
</P>
<P>
THE SHADOW IN THE SUN BY MICHAEL SHAPIRO (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $19.95; 252 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Horvat, Horvat is a Canadian journalist who has covered Japan and 
Korea for the past 20 years. He is at present a research associate at the David 
Lam Centre for International Communication at Simon Fraser University in 
Vancouver. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past four decades, more than a million Americans have spent up to two 
years each in South Korea. Although American servicemen have been to Japan and 
Europe in large numbers too, South Korea occupies a unique void in the American 
consciousness. With the exception of a few scholarly works, nothing has been 
written by a serious American writer about Koreans and their society. 
</P>
<P>
With this collection of 20 portraits of ordinary -- as well as some very 
extraordinary -- Koreans, Michael Shapiro has gone a long way toward filling 
this void, and he has done it with a mixture of sympathy, criticism and irony 
that will fascinate even those readers who never will visit Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro is there when a family of squatters is forced to move from their 
hillside hovel to make way for new apartments they are too poor to afford. He 
interviews a woman who makes her living by having her breasts fondled by 
customers in a rural coffee shop. And he briefly follows the life of a shy 
young man who resists family pressure and refuses to marry the woman of his 
parents' choice. He talks to a released political prisoner, a family of 
refugees-turned-millionaires, and an elderly male dancer who at the height of 
his career was the greatest exponent of the female dance of salpuri, through 
which Korean women traditionally have rid themselves of the all-encompassing 
sense of bitterness which Koreans call han. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the one unifying theme of "The Shadow in the Sun" is the concept of 
han, and the mercurial shifts of mood which many Koreans are given to as they 
catapult themselves between han and jong (passionate love), the other extreme 
of the emotional spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
There is han in the lives of the evicted squatter family, in the moods of the 
coffee-house hostess unable to collect debts from the men who fondle her and 
leave her with worthless IOUs, and -- by a recent leap of logic -- there is 
also han in the hearts of Korean student radicals who demonstrate against their 
country's military-backed regimes and the United States government, which they 
see as the ultimate sponsor of the domestic forces that oppress them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the han of the police state and the han of progress," writes Shapiro, 
"There is the han imposed by outsiders -- especially the great powers, most 
especially the United States. And there is the han that is not acknowledged, 
the han of the hatreds and cruelties Koreans inflict upon one another." 
Earlier, Shapiro observes that "each day in Korea somebody is fighting and 
losing to another fellow, who is always wrong and who will not be forgiven." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro is at his best in his vignettes of the daily lives of ordinary people. 
In one episode, two greedy women come to a fortune-teller, who disappoints them 
by failing to give his approval for the marriage of the son of one to the 
daughter of the other. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with marrying him off this year? Why can't we hurry this marriage 
along?" asks one of the women. "The girl's mother has approved my son. I like 
her too." 
</P>
<P>
But the fortuneteller is practical. "Who cares if you and the girl's mother 
like her? They have to like each other." 
</P>
<P>
Warned against lending money for a while, the woman pleads with the 
fortuneteller. "Not even a little?" Shapiro concludes with the sentence, 
"Luckily, she knew other fortunetellers." 
</P>
<P>
"Shadow," however, is not without a number of flaws, some of which are likely 
to irritate those familiar with Korean history. One recurring problem is the 
author's acceptance at face value of the myth of Korea's "5,000-year history." 
The earliest existing Korean dynastic history dates only from the present 
millennium, and the earliest Chinese reference to a kingdom in Korea (ruled in 
fact by a Chinese refugee) is in the second century BC. A reader who accepts 
that Korea is 5,000 years old might be only mildly surprised by the members of 
the fringe religion the author interviews who claim that the Korean nation 
actually was founded 10,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Another problematic figure is the number of Americans who died in the Korean 
War (54,000 according to Shapiro, 33,629 according to UN statistics). There 
seem to be a few others too, such as the numbers of incidents along the DMZ. 
Shapiro lets stand the ludicrous figure of 99,952, given by a tour guide. This 
works out to more than eight hostile acts per day every day since the 1953 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Some readers also may find it difficult to accept the author's starkly 
black-and-white view of the regime of former president Chun Doo Hwan. While it 
is true that Chun was heavy-handed with the press, it also is worthwhile to 
take note of how he successfully co-opted the media in truly Machiavellian 
fashion by giving those papers he did not close down a chance to reap enormous 
profits. Under Chun, news reporters were a pampered lot who kept quiet not so 
much out of fear as out of the knowledge that they had a vested interest in the 
regime. Chun gave 20% tax breaks to reporters, sent scores on "overseas study 
tours" and provided generous scholarships to their offspring. Exposing the 
calumnies of fallen dictators may make one feel good, but understanding how 
they succeeded is in the long run probably more useful. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of its flaws, "The Shadow in the Sun" does what it sets out to do, 
which is to reveal the emotional flavor of a country that both attracts and 
repels at the same time. In an unusual twist, the author starts his book with a 
scene of himself at an airport eagerly awaiting the departure of his plane. "I 
am drained by Korea. I am exhausted by its moods," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last day of the Seoul Olympics and Shapiro, a sports- writer, was 
fleeing from an example of Korean han that became news around the world. 
American reporters had been warned of the outpouring of Korean ill-will against 
them because of the wide coverage NBC gave to a boxing match a few days earlier 
which ended with Korean boxing officials pummeling a New Zealand referee who 
had had the audacity to rule against a Korean contestant. According to Korean 
logic, NBC -- and by extension all of the United States -- had humiliated Korea 
before the world by using its high-tech satellite equipment to beam this 
embarrassing scene to all corners of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Three years earlier, the author had fallen in love with South Korea when he 
arrived from cold and reserved Tokyo, which "had none of Seoul's vibrancy, none 
of its life." But upon leaving at the end of the Olympics, he writes, "(I) have 
begun to feel as if I were locked in a small room with a manic-depressive." 
</P>
<P>
The phrase is likely to be repeated often by many a visitor forced by business 
or the whims of air carriers to remain an extra day or two in limbo between han 
and jong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
(Excert) 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes her eyes hurt, especially after a long shift. A long shift might last 
eighteen hours. But this work, she explained, was better than the work she had 
done before, at a fabric factory where it was hot and dusty. Miss Kim came from 
the countryside. As her older brothers and sisters had, she left her parents' 
home the day after graduating from high school. She stayed with her brother 
and, through a friend, found a job. 
</P>
<P>
'I heard through the older girls that I would work hard all day but I could 
earn lots of money,' she said. 'I thought I'd save more money, but my savings 
plan was unrealistic. I was going to send a third to my mother and save the 
rest for my dowry.' 
</P>
<P>
'Do you enjoy the city?' I asked. 
</P>
<P>
'No, I want to go home,' Miss Kim said. 'There is no green here. I was 
disappointed in city people. They have bad values. . . . I've tried but I'm 
becoming like that.' -- From "The Shadow in the Sun"

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marcel Montecino's debut novel, "The Crosskiller," was a harsh, grittily 
atmospheric and hard-to-set-aside thriller. His second novel, Big Time (William 
Morrow: $19.95; 493 pp.), is no less harsh and violent and not a bit easier to 
set aside once you've entered upon Montecino's long, picaresque cat-and-rat 
chase. Even after nearly 500 pages fecund with character and event, the story 
seems not so much to have concluded as to have paused for breath. 
</P>
<P>
Sal D'Amore is a New Orleans lounge pianist-songwriter-compulsive gambler, a 
self-made loser. As we meet him he is vamping until ready as bartender and 
transcriber of phone bets in a Family-owned saloon. He gets caught out betting 
wrong on a fixed race and has to go on the lam, remorselessly pursued all over 
the Western Hemisphere by killers who aim to settle the bet with a long goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Montecino is with all else a funny writer with what you might call a specialty 
in violent farce. Sal's progress is a Saturday serial succession of 
hairsbreadth 'scapes, beatings, shootings, rescues and rebirths, usually 
attended by ladies of uncommon pliancy. Worse luck: He becomes a musical 
celebrity with his picture in Time and Newsweek, and thus the easier to locate. 
He also becomes a man deeply in love with the wrong woman. 
</P>
<P>
All his couplings are explicit to a degree even now still not common in crime 
fiction, and readers who prefer the wink to biological precision are 
forewarned. 
</P>
<P>
The author clearly has strong feelings for music, and Sal's thoughts about the 
piano and the making of songs are the nicest things about him. About the only 
nice things about him, in fact. Yet long before he is fished naked as a cod out 
of the sea for what may or may not be the last time, you are rooting for him 
for reasons that defy logic. It is a tribute to Montecino's ability to make 
this improbable rake's progress so visually and viscerally compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Another gambler, obsessive but not compulsive, is William Murray's Shifty Lou 
Anderson, a professional sleight-of-hand magician when he isn't haunting Santa 
Anita or Del Mar. He is back again in The Getaway Blues (Bantam: $17.95; 218 
pp.). 
</P>
<P>
Languishing amid a shortage of both gigs and winners, Shifty becomes part-time 
chauffeur to an eccentric millionaire horse owner who is also designing an 
elaborate private mausoleum to receive him once he has bumped himself off, 
which he plans to do momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
Complications arise in the lithe form of a beautiful woman his ex-wife says is 
the eccentric's own daughter. She isn't, but the eccentric -- no longer quite 
so eager to bid the world adieu -- doesn't care. There is a back story, dark 
and evil, as Shifty Lou discovers soon enough, although not before murder has 
been multiply done. 
</P>
<P>
Handicapping races, Shifty says, is a kind of sleuthing. "Ferreting out secrets 
and solving puzzles is what I do at the race track," he says, "which is a great 
training ground for life." You might get an argument about that, but the 
strength of this likable series is Murray's affectionate familiarity with the 
tracks, the trainers and owners, the running of a races and above all the 
bettors whose hopes never quite die. In the new book, Murray's eccentric is an 
interesting creation, and so is a beautiful but luckless vegetarian lady. 
</P>
<P>
Like Scott Turow, Jay Brandon is a practicing lawyer and a former assistant 
district attorney, his venue being San Antonio. Brandon's fourth novel, Fade 
the Heat (Pocket Books: $18.95; 342 pp.), bears very favorable comparison with 
"Presumed Innocent" in its intimate familiarity with the justice system, and in 
its depiction of a man of law for whom the law becomes an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Blackwell is the new district attorney of San Antonio. His son, a computer 
whiz working late at night in his office, is entrapped in a rape charge. The 
ploy is to maneuver Blackwell into dismissing a case against a local crime 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
The son is convicted anyway, and Blackwell is left to try to prove he was sent 
up on perjured testimony. Brandon's plotting is intricate and proceeds by 
crackingly dramatic scenes and some surprising turns. But beyond its 
excitements, the novel also is a sensitive portrait of a man in anguish over 
his son's fate and facing hard moral choices. The courtroom scenes, always 
sure-fire, are sure-fire once again. Steven Spielberg has optioned the book. 
</P>
<P>
Freeze Frame (William Morrow: $18.95; 320 pp.) by Marjorie Dorner is an 
expertly suspenseful story about a young American scholar on sabbatical at 
Cambridge University. On a Sunday stroll she takes a snapshot that may show in 
the background a serial killer and the young woman who was to be his next 
victim. The killer knows, although Beth Conroy doesn't, what a damning truth 
the camera may hold, and he begins to stalk her. 
</P>
<P>
Donner compounds the suspense by leaving it unclear until a last mad pursuit 
through the dark English night just which of three or four men Conroy has met 
is actually the killer. A tidy, almost understated thriller with a strong sense 
of place and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth George of Huntington Beach, whose first mystery, "A Great 
Deliverance," won some major awards, is back with her third, Well-Schooled in 
Murder (Bantam: $17.95; 356 pp.), which is again set in Britain and again 
features the high-born Inspector Thomas Lynley of the Yard. 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration of P. D. James can be imagined, whether she was indeed a role 
model for Howard or not. There is the same care for elegant and eloquent 
language, the same patient accruing of detail, the same subtle delineation of 
character and interplay, and there is the meticulous and complex plotting. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is a public school, several ranks down from Eton but with 
desperately held pretentions to grandeur. A schoolboy is murdered; one of the 
masters shares an old-school tie with Lynley, who looks in with his impatient, 
unimpressed, working-class aide, Sgt. Havers. 
</P>
<P>
The school is a dreadful mess of kinky cliques, incompetent staff, o'erweening 
alumni and a pervasive wish to deny that anything is wrong. The tragic victim 
was simply in the wrong school for the wrong reasons. The author's scorn for 
the school and the kind of classism it reflects is evident, if too cool to be 
called outrage. But the story is both startling and saddening. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran mystery writer Thomas Chastain has been authorized by the estate of 
Erle Stanley Gardner, who died in 1970, to extend the life of Perry Mason. 
Gardner wrote 83 Mason mysteries, which have sold a reported 300 million copies 
and led to one of television's most predictable series. 
</P>
<P>
The Case of the Burning Bequest (William Morrow: $15.95; 240 pp.) is Chastain's 
second go-round, and it is so faithful to the crisp, primer-simple and 
superficial style of the originals that no one can accuse Chastain of departing 
an inch from tradition. John Leland is accused of murdering his stepmother, who 
disapproved of his marriage to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of back story, and something odd about the fireplace, and as 
usual Della Street and Paul Drake Jr. (son of the original investigator) seem 
capable of digging up information during a court recess that would take an 
ordinary researcher weeks. They are a great comfort to a lawyer, or an author. 
</P>
<P>
The revivals are an amusing curiosity for the faithful, but they measure the 
strides forward detective fiction has made in mirroring reality with no loss in 
entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
Sisters in Crime III, edited by Marilyn Wallace, (Berkley: $3.95, paper; 336 
pp.) is the third anthology of short stories by women, most although not all of 
whom are members of the Sisters in Crime organization. Like most anthologies, 
this one is erratic in quality, but it is an instructive introduction to some 
of the brightest new voices in the mystery field. Prime items include "The 
Maltese Cat" by Sara Paretsky, "Wow Finish" by Gabrielle Kraft and a grim 
little item called "Say You're Sorry" by Sarah Shankman.

THE CRISIS IN AIDS CARE;

<P>
KIMON BEAZLIE MANAGED TO REACH his mid-40s retaining a free spirit and 
unflagging energy. He was a Hollywood costume designer with stocky good looks, 
almond brown eyes and a penchant for six-day workweeks -- a habit that earned 
him, in good times, as much as $80,000 a year. In off hours, he was an amateur 
rock climber and a breeder of exotic birds. He wore his hair in a style 
befitting his Hawaiian descent: a thick dark mane dangling nearly to his waist. 
</P>
<P>
But one night last summer, Beazlie's life took a sharp turn. He was brushing 
his teeth when pain stabbed the roof of his mouth -- a canker sore, he thought, 
craning to look. What he found, instead, was something startling: Behind a 
front tooth hung a bulbous mass the size of a nickel. A second one, nearly 
identical, hung at the rear of his mouth. Beazlie tilted closer to the mirror, 
wondering, "Oh, my God, what is that?' " 
</P>
<P>
The discovery -- it would turn out to be Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare skin cancer 
-- thrust Beazlie into the world of AIDS. It would turn his life completely 
around, shutting off his past as if a steel curtain had clanged down behind 
him. In failing health, Kimon Beazlie surrendered his job, lost his health 
insurance and left behind many friends in the movie and television industries. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of jolting events, he found out what it is like to live as an AIDS 
patient in Los Angeles County. The experience, he learned, just as so many 
others learn, is a relentless nightmare; it is a bitter story of government 
snafus and family prejudices, tears and "T cells," compassion and profound 
hurt. While one faces death and grasps desperately for time, fighting the 
medical bureacracy can be almost as difficult and debilitating as the disease. 
Beazlie is one of thousands who, as the moments of his life slip away, has 
grown angry and cynical about the underfunded, conservatively administered 
county system, which is ranked among the worst in the nation at dealing with 
the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, where the numbers (of infected persons) are increasing daily 
-- by enormous leaps -- it is startling to see the level of denial or 
detachment (that the county has shown)" says Dr. June Osborn, chairwoman of the 
National Commission on AIDS. During special hearings held in Los Angeles 
earlier this year, Osborn and other commission members castigated county 
supervisors for what they considered chronic shortfalls in funding and 
commitment for AIDS programs. "There was a sense that local government was 
trying to distance itself from the epidemic as if it was somebody else's 
problem,"she says. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the countywide death toll from AIDS has reached 5,600. And the future 
looks worse. According to the county's estimates, 2,800 patients are now 
fighting the disease, and that number is expected to climb to 24,000 in three 
years. A total of 109,000 people in Los Angeles are believed to be infected 
with the deadly virus; they, too, are living on borrowed time. 
</P>
<P>
Each faces daunting hurdles. The disease is one thing: Acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome is particularly cruel and pitiless-a dark, ever-deepening 
tunnel of physical and psychological horrors. The average AIDS patient lives 22 
months after diagnosis, but that, like nearly every other aspect of the 
disease, is unpredictable. The eroded immune system tends to break down under 
stress, or in reaction to powerful, toxic medications designed to control the 
virus. AIDS allows any number of infections to hit where the patient is 
weakest, often creating a grim cycle of illness, recovery and deeper illness. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, at this time of extreme frailty, the person with AIDS must master the 
tricky ropes of the public health system. The waiting list for outpatient care 
at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center -- the hub of the county's AIDS 
treatment program -- is now three months, long enough for some patients to 
seriously weaken or even die. The clinic, which treats people who cannot afford 
private care, was handling 400 patients a month just a few years ago; now the 
number exceeds 2,000, rendering personalized care all but impossible. A new 
three-story clinic, with four times the medical examining rooms and a capacity 
for 3,500 patients, was expected to open this year. But faulty initial designs 
has delayed the target date to next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie, who sought health care at County-USC after losing his private 
insurance, is one of five patients who agreed to share a chronicle of what it 
is like to deal with life as an AIDS patient in Los Angeles. Each of the five 
faced different problems and responded with different attitudes, emotions and 
fears. A maverick among them, who dropped out of treatment against the county's 
advice, Beazlie is the most disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
"The county is a very unfeeling group," he says matter-of-factly. "You get the 
impression, after a while, that you're just delivering a slab of meat for them 
to do their little thing on." 
</P>
<P>
As he talks, Beazlie strolls through County-USC's crowded, windowless 
outpatient clinic, known as 5P21. The clinic is unique in Los Angeles -- the 
only full-time public clinic for AIDS treatment as well as the county's center 
for experimental drug research into the disease. In jeans, a turtleneck shirt 
and three-day growth of beard, Beazlie moves familiarly through the 
pale-yellow, hallways. 
</P>
<P>
The halls are as long as 70 yards, lined with wood benches crowded with men 
awaiting treatment. In their 30s mostly, they form an eerie sight: 
Hollow-faced, many of them move with the trembling slowness of the elderly. 
Beazlie strides past them, past an overhead television, and enters a section of 
hallway blocked by two metal chairs lashed together with a sign: "Restricted 
area: Only those patients receiving treatment allowed beyond this point." 
</P>
<P>
Here, on Thursdays, Kaposi's sarcoma patients like Beazlie line up, a dozen or 
so at a time in the hallway, for intravenous blood transfusions and 
chemotherapy. "You have people just starting out, trying to be optimistic, 
sitting next to people who are a breath away from being dead," Beazlie says, 
gesturing to the metal IV racks, now idle. "It's like, 'This is where you're 
going . . . . You're going to die.' " 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, a patient trying to sit in a wheelchair collapses to the floor. 
"Loss of motor control," Beazlie explains calmly, seemingly inured to such 
scenes. He sees a nurse he knows and lavishes praise ("She can find veins that 
don't exist!"), and later talks enthusiastically about a doctor, just one of 
many unsung heroes here, who shows promise "as a healer." 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie has learned to talk dispassionately about his own eventual death. He 
forecasts it by year's end because his sarcoma is eating at his insides: "There 
are days when I can't get out of bed. If I get a coughing spasm, I faint. I 
hyperventilate. You just learn to deal. That's what life is all about, anyway. 
We're just getting a concentrated crash course on dealing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, a new wheelchair rolls in. In it is an angular young man with sandy brown 
hair so delicate it might belong to a child. His legs are stick-thin. In his 
expressionless face are wide, staring eyes -- the eyes of someone who sees but 
does not understand. It is a young man whom Beazlie recognizes, someone he 
knows from long-ago visits here. Beazlie's eyes fill with tears. 
</P>
<P>
"I just haven't seen him in a while," he says, his voice breaking. "He's only 
24. He's a street kid, has no family. And he's really gotten bad." And for a 
long moment, Kimon Beazlie cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
SILVIO R. HERNANDEZ, 59, is known to friends as Rudy -- notwithstanding a 
mix-up on his birth records, he was named after Rudolph Valentino. He fled Cuba 
as a young man, studied briefly at Louisiana State University and had come west 
in the early 1970s, drawn by the excitement that California offered. Charming 
and affable, he took an apartment in the burgeoning gay community near the 
Sunset Strip and surrounded himself artwork and film posters. He managed a 
storage company, and his health was good except for bouts of asthma. 
</P>
<P>
Then one evening three years ago, as he watched television, Hernandez was 
seized by a galvanizing sensation "like a positive and negative cable coming 
together" in his head. The jolt lasted several seconds, followed moments later 
by another one. Screaming, he summoned help by telephone and was rushed to a 
hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was vertigo -- an unexplained dizziness. For several days, 
Hernandez was confined to a hospital room, his equilibrium so poor he had 
difficulty reaching the bathroom. Aware that he belonged to a high-risk group 
because he was gay, he asked to be tested for the human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
The results were positive. For a year, Hernandez stayed home on disability 
because of the vertigo. Doctors could never link the HIV virus with the strange 
episode of dizziness, but soon Hernandez experienced other health problems: His 
asthma worsened; he couldn't walk three blocks without gasping for breath. 
Bursitis set in. He could not raise his arm over his head. He became so 
fatigued he sometimes could not pick up light objects from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
He fretted incessantly that the virus, once dormant in his blood, was now 
attacking. Months passed, and a particularly severe asthma attack nearly choked 
him. He was taken again to an emergency room. Psychologically, the torment 
grew, day and night, an unshakable curse that left him crying, unable to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Already, I was getting a lot of emotion," Hernandez says in a voice that still 
sings with a Cuban accent. "I was dealing with the fact I was going to die. You 
wake up at 1 or 2 in the morning and you start thinking, thinking, thinking. 
You cannot go back to sleep for three or four hours. You wake up in the morning 
and you are so tired because you spent four hours at night thinking." 
</P>
<P>
As his year of state disability neared an end, Hernandez ran head-on into the 
first of the insurance problems that would plague him for years. His private 
health-care provider, which had been charging $600 a month for coverage, raised 
his premiums to $1,000. A $50-a-month supplemental policy from another company 
was canceled because he lived in a "high-risk" neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez suspects that the insurance companies learned of his HIV diagnosis 
through his medical records. The huge increase in premiums forced him to drop 
his private coverage and in early 1987, a year after his attack of vertigo, 
Hernandez boarded a bus for East Los Angeles. The trip to County-USC Medical 
Center took 90 minutes, including a transfer downtown, and the wait inside 
5P21, even with an appointment, was often three hours. But Hernandez had heard 
that the medical care, once you got it, was excellent. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first experiences was a laboratory blood test of his T-4 helper 
cells, the agents of the immune system that are attacked by the HIV virus. Once 
in the cell, the virus replicates, destroying the cell in the process. 
Measuring the "T-cell" counts gives doctors a rough -- and sometimes suspect -- 
barometer of the health of the immune system. Healthy human blood contains 800 
to 1,200 or more T-4 cells per cubic millimeter. In AIDS patients, the counts 
are often dramatically lower, and often fluctuate widely even in a single 
patient. Under current guidelines, patients can begin receiving AZT -- the 
relatively effective, but toxic, drug for halting the replication of the virus 
-- when T-cell counts drop below 500, or when full-blown AIDS is diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Hernandez's test, however, AZT was not prescribed until T-cell 
levels fell below 200. Hernandez's reading was 219. "I was not too familiar 
with the T-cell situation," he recalls. "I say, 'What does that mean?' (The 
doctors) say, 'You are OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
The pronouncement was something Hernandez had difficulty believing. His T 
cells, monitored every three months, showed an improvement to more than 400 in 
a subsequent test, but his health was getting worse. He had difficulty walking 
because of pain, and at night he woke up sweating and feverish. He had diarrhea 
continually, and again he was rushed to the emergency room with an asthma 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
A records clerk at County-USC Medical Center signed a letter for Hernandez in 
September, 1988, declaring him medically disabled. Armed with that, Silvio 
Hernandez took the first step in his long dealings with the government 
bureaucracy: He applied for Social Security benefits, a process that normally 
takes three months. 
</P>
<P>
TIM WALSH TOOK STOCK of his fast-paced life in the summer of 1987 and told 
himself: You've got to slow down. He was 25, a lanky kid from the San Fernando 
Valley with thin brown hair and large, serious eyes. He worked as a computer 
specialist at a law firm and kept a social calendar packed with events -- 
gourmet meals that he cooked at home, traveling, parties. He and his lover, a 
transplanted Northern Californian named Ron Satora, shared a West Hollywood 
apartment near the night life. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hernandez, Walsh was aware that he belonged to a high-risk group in a city 
that was being hit harder by the epidemic than anywhere in Southern California. 
Walsh also was feeling ill -- anemic, feverish. His bones ached. A burning 
sensation developed in his throat and spread down his esophagus, making it 
difficult to swallow even water. He started losing weight. Like many gay men, 
he paid enormous attention to each real or imagined change in his physiology, 
and yet he argued with himself: He felt he was just running himself ragged. 
</P>
<P>
A vacation would help, he decided. He had blood drawn for an HIV test and left 
with the sandy-haired Satora, a bank operations specialist and prize-winning 
amateur bowler, for Waikiki, for the relaxation that might heal him. But 
increasingly, he knew: Something was drastically wrong. He barely made it 
through the 10-day trip. While Satora sought out the Hawaiian night life, Walsh 
returned early to their room on the beach. The test results were awaiting him 
on the mainland, but he knew in his gut what they would show. 
</P>
<P>
At the testing center, Walsh listened, lit a cigarette and cried. 
</P>
<P>
Then he became sicker -- rapidly. Just three weeks after getting the test 
results, he was admitted to Queen of Angels Hospital with bleeding ulcers, 
tuberculosis, anemia and herpes of the esophagus. "The consensus among doctors 
not versed in AIDS was that he was going to die," Walsh's private physician, 
Dr. Peter Kennedy, says. Walsh's hospital stay lasted all of October; his 
T-cell count hovered ominously near zero. 
</P>
<P>
Rallying some strength, Walsh finally went home, but his struggles had only 
begun. In a condition so fragile that he cries when he remembers it, Walsh was 
forced to confront the realities of his life: He needed help. He began visiting 
his doctor regularly under a private health-care plan, often undergoing 
transfusions, often becoming demanding and loud. "It was very clear he was just 
scared to death," Kennedy says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Satora was wondering: Me too? 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the relationship together was to be one of the tender and stormy 
challenges of Walsh's life. One bone-chilling autumn night, Walsh began 
reaching out for help, for himself and Satora. Escorted by his mother, Bonnie, 
and Satora, he joined a crowd of nearly 300 assembled by activist Louise Hay in 
a West Hollywood park -- a regular meeting of meditation, chanting and 
encouragement for AIDS sufferers. As individual members of the crowd were 
invited to speak, Walsh asked for the microphone. He grasped it and, looking 
around at the crowd, could not utter a word before he began crying. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the crowd soon engulfed him, offering cards, telephone numbers. It 
was an omen of good fortune. Walsh would get help. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's employer kept him on its payroll and essentially ordered him to stay 
home. ("They didn't think I was going to last," he says.) He also left his 
apartment, where Satora was awaiting results of an HIV test of his own, and 
returned temporarily to his mother's house in Culver City. Bonnie Walsh took 
charge of her son's daily regimen of drugs. She put the multitude of pills, 
about 10 in all, in plastic bags, and Walsh took a bag's worth every four 
hours, day and night. Meanwhile, Walsh was on the phone to local nonprofit help 
groups, including Being Alive, Aid for AIDS and Aids Project Los Angeles. From 
them, he learned of the state's TK YEAR OLD Health Insurance Premium Program 
(HIPP), through which the government pays insurance premiums for AIDS patients 
to help them maintain their private insurance plans and keep them out of the 
public health-care system. It would enable him to retain his private physician 
and possibly, because of that's doctor's interest in his welfare, play an 
important role in keeping him alive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taken hold of his illness," Bonnie says. 
</P>
<P>
Satora, meanwhile, tested positive for the virus, a result he expected. He and 
Walsh talked about it. Facing death was one thing; but now, what Satora dreaded 
was facing his family. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of six children, Satora had grown up in conservative surroundings in 
the town of Livermore, near Oakland. His His father had been the type to tell 
homosexual jokes. His mother, a strict Roman Catholic, had become alarmed when 
Satora first started living with a male roommate years earlier. She would call 
at 4 and 5 in the morning, waking her son and demanding: "Are you gay? I can't 
accept you that way!" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm not gay," Satora would say, lying to appease her. 
</P>
<P>
Now he would give his parents a double whammy, the same double whammy that so 
many parents have received throughout the epidemic: He was not only gay, he was 
also HIV infected. He planned to break the news on a trip home for 
Thanksgiving. He flew north, re-entered the household of his youth, where his 
father and younger brothers made flip remarks about gays and AIDS and his 
mother gave him that same old accusing look. 
</P>
<P>
"It just made me sicker inside," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
So Satora stayed for the holiday, told no one in his family about his diagnosis 
and came home. 
</P>
<P>
UNDER THE TOWERING main building of the County-USC medical center is a 
cavernous basement the size of a football field, packed with color-coded 
folders containing the vital charts, laboratory reports and other medical 
records of more than 1 million patients. The files fill row upon row of high 
shelves seemingly into infinity. Frequently, partly because of the sheer 
volume, files become lost; patients' claims for Medi-Cal or Social Security 
reimbursements -- the only income that keeps some AIDS patients off the streets 
-- are explicably denied or tied up in months of red tape. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's claim was answered in four months: Denied. His file, the agency 
said, contained insufficient information. 
</P>
<P>
The news was followed, a month later, by a change in his medical condition. The 
silver-haired movie fan developed a herpes rash covering much of his body. As 
the rash disappeared with medication, something worse appeared: herpes-related 
shingles affecting nearly all of his right leg. The nerve condition was so 
excruciating that Hernandez was referred to County-USC's Cancer Pain clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in pain severe enough to keep him from sleeping," remembers Dr. David 
Cundiff, who prescribed a morphinelike drug. "He was virtually immobilized." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was not without help: He was sharing his apartment with a longtime 
companion who was not infected -- a man who could cook and attend to chores -- 
and numerous other friends were there for moral support. But not one of them 
could stop the agony. 
</P>
<P>
"I was screaming, yelling, in my home at 2 (and) 3 o'clock in the morning, 
putting ice, things like that," Hernandez says. During the same month he 
visited the Cancer Pain clinic, he submitted a new application for Social 
Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
TIM WALSH WAS BACK in the hospital at St. Vincent Medical Center only three 
months after his near-death. Admitted this time with a fever of 105, he 
recuperated for three weeks, and left with the same dismal T-cell levels. 
</P>
<P>
The stay marked a turning point, however. He and his lover had reached a 
decision: Walsh would return home to their apartment. Somehow, against almost 
insurmountable despair, they would try to sustain a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally, there were times worth savoring -- day trips, dinners out. 
Walsh spent many idyllic afternoons poolside at the Los Angeles Center for 
Living, a now-defunct gathering place in a quiet neighborhood where people with 
life-threatening illnesses were able to sit and chat. Surrounding the pool was 
a yard with ferns and brick, and usually there was music and an afternoon meal 
of salad, cheese and rice. 
</P>
<P>
Satora, however, who was still without symptoms, shied away from such groups. 
He bowled, continued working and tended to Walsh in the evenings. At times, 
when the pressure built to more than he could handle, he shouted, threw things, 
slammed his fist into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
On a day in April, nearly five months after his trip home for Thanksgiving, the 
mounting fears about his own health and the possibility that he could begin an 
experimental drug treatment even before developing symptoms prompted Satora to 
act. He telephoned his family and finally broke the news: He was gay, he was 
HIV positive and he was seeing a private doctor. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was much as he feared. His father, the more understanding of his 
parents, has not told gay joke since. But his mother came apart with fury. She 
sent a letter to Satora saying he was no longer her son -- she disowned him. 
His lifestyle, she ranted mutely, was disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years since Satora opened the letter, he and his mother have not 
spoken, except for one or two angry exchanges. "My mother died April 28, 1988," 
Satora says. "That's the day I got the letter." 
</P>
<P>
BY EARLY 1989, the county's death toll was 4,484 and the number of reported new 
AIDS cases averaged 214 a month, more than double the rate of just three years 
earlier. The numbers were so routinely horrifying that they had begun to lose 
their shock value. It was in July that Kimon Beazlie became one of those 
statistics, discovering the fleshy masses on the roof of his mouth that 
represented full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie, who had known he was HIV-infected, quit his job as a costume designer, 
and found himself without insurance and needing urgent medical care. The 
solution was obvious: 5P21. But the wait was nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped at the clinic every week during that time, trying to see a doctor 
because he "kept freaking out," Beazlie says. Patiently, a nurse practitioner 
explained each time that he would have to wait. The clinic was booked. He was 
not bleeding. He was not so desperately ill that he had to be admitted to an 
AIDS ward or an emergency room. His lesions would be examined when the time 
came for his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Having no money for private care, Beazlie passed the time at home as the two 
sarcoma lesions ate sores into his tongue. "They were like very potent battery 
acid," he recalls. "The pain was too excruciating." To sleep, he taped a 
four-inch wood dowel in his mouth to keep his tongue from touching the boils. 
The lesions "finally erupted and drained down my throat before I ever got to 
see a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
After seven weeks, Beazlie kept his appointment at 5P21. Doctors prescribed 
chemotherapy, which, he was told, would put the Kaposi's sarcoma into remission 
and give him some months of relatively good health. 
</P>
<P>
Ric Abeytia also became another of the growing number of statistics last year. 
A banker who resided in South Pasadena, Abeytia had just changed jobs and, like 
Beazlie, was without health insurance. At 37, he is a thoughtful, disarmingly 
witty man with the look of a young college professor, sporting wire-frame 
glasses and a thick shock of black hair. 
</P>
<P>
Abeytia entered County-USC Medical Center via the emergency room. A week after 
developing flulike symptoms, he began vomiting blood. Emergency room attendants 
pumped his stomach and talked about him, as he lay on the gurney, as if he were 
an ulcer-plagued alcoholic ("Wait a minute," Abeytia recalls saying, "Why are 
you treating me as an alcoholic? I don't drink!"). He was fed intravenously for 
several days and sent home, undiagnosed. Probably a bleeding ulcer, he was 
told. 
</P>
<P>
The next month it flared up again -- the same problem, the same trip to E.R., 
the same weeklong stay on a gurney. 
</P>
<P>
Abeytia was becoming exasperated. A month later, deja vu. More vomiting, more 
blood. Back into E.R. for a third time, for another stomach pump, for more IVs. 
Assertive by nature, Abeytia pressed for answers. Something was wrong. 
Something was causing this. What was it? 
</P>
<P>
Months earlier, fearful because several friends had developed AIDS, Abeytia had 
submitted to an HIV test. The result was negative, a finding he had doubted 
then and which now became more suspect. He lay for several days on a gurney in 
a unit called the Red Blanket Room -- for patients with internal bleeding until 
he at last got lucky: He saw a friend, a one-time musician named Francisco 
Garcia, who happened to be a research nurse at the medical center. Garcia's 
specialty was upper-gastrointestinal hemorrhages, and he was screening patients 
in the Red Blanket room to find candidates for internal scoping -- a procedure, 
technically called an endoscopy, in which a fiber-optic tube is inserted into 
the stomach to look for problems. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who hardly recognized his sickly friend, scheduled Abeytia for an 
endoscopy, which identified the problem as candidal esophagitis, a fungal 
infection associated with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Abeytia was indignant that it took three hospital visits -- a total of about 12 
days -- before the endoscopy was performed, but Garcia noted that at a county 
hospital, where funding is chronically short, not every test can be performed 
on every patient. "We see masses of people here," Garcia says. "It's not like 
going to a private hospital where you have the total attention of the doctors 
and nurses and you can run as many tests as you want." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Abeytia was now at the right place: 5P21. Like several hundred 
patients there, he chose to take advantage of one of the clinic's most 
important services -- experimental drug trials. At any given time, about 70 
different AIDS drugs are being tested on county patients who volunteer to take 
them. In Abeytia's case, the drug was one formulated to stop the candidal 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to work, but his T cells -- monitored frequently during drug trials 
-- declined during the next few months. Abeytia became a scholar of the 
illness, learning about drugs and his own body as if he were trying to master 
the programs and hardware of a home computer. Only in this case, the hardware 
was failing. He soon developed tuberculosis, which required a drug incompatible 
with the stomach medication. He gave up the stomach drug only to have a relapse 
of internal bleeding, which landed him once again -- the fourth time -- in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A new T-cell report was back from the lab soon after he was released: He was 
down to 120, a drop of nearly 400 T cells in three months. Abeytia was alarmed. 
The numbers just kept dropping. Where would they be in the next three months? 
Or even in three weeks? He would have no T cells left -- he was dying. He left 
the clinic and took the freeway home, crying. 
</P>
<P>
The T-cell counts finally stabilized. He was now taking the drug AZT, which 
caused nausea and vomiting, but in late summer, Abeytia enjoyed a short span of 
relatively good health. The next problem that developed was by now, at least, 
familiar: the rather hollow feeling in his gut that invariably preceded the 
bouts of internal bleeding. This time he was ready for it. All he needed was 
the stomach drug. 
</P>
<P>
Could he get it? 
</P>
<P>
He was talking with the physician's assistant who handled most of his 
appointments at 5P21. The medical staffer was skeptical. He was reluctant to 
prescribe the drug because Abeytia was showing no obvious symptoms. Drugs 
frequently have side effects, and it was quite possible that Abeytia was 
reacting to only fear and paranoia. An argument ensued, and Abeytia left 
without the medication. He was persuaded, instead, to schedule an appointment 
with a county psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
SILVIO HERNANDEZ'S SECOND claim for Social Security, following the paralyzing 
nerve problem in his leg, went unanswered for three months. He was now a 
familiar sight in the AIDS clinic; it had been 3 1/2 years since his attack of 
vertigo and 18 months since he had become a regular at 5P21. It was also eight 
months since he had first applied for monthly Social Security payments. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, still suffering intensely and walking with a cane, was becoming 
obsessed with his quest for the long-term disability benefits, which would 
total nearly $700 a month. The urgency was fueled by the recent death, of AIDS, 
of a close friend from Puerto Rico, a man who had responded to his declining 
health by going on a rampage of drugs and alcohol; Hernandez had just attended 
his memorial service. His sense of mortality inflamed, he called the Social 
Security office and demanded to know the status of his case. His file, someone 
explained, was not there -- it was lost. 
</P>
<P>
"How can that be?" Hernandez shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. It wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
He cried during the night. He could not sleep. "I think that damaged my 
situation more than the disease," he says. Hernandez -- who keeps thick files 
documenting his case -- reports that the missing file was discovered a month 
later. It had not been reviewed, however, so he was asked to wait three 
additional weeks while a decision was made. He was given a date and time, he 
says, and assured that a call would come. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez waited by the phone. It never rang. 
</P>
<P>
Angry, Hernandez again badgered the office, only to be told -- once again -- 
that his file was incomplete. A Social Security official offered to send him, 
free, to a doctor in the San Fernando Valley, where the necessary reports could 
be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez indignantly refused. Had he not been seeing county doctors for 18 
months? Why was that not good enough for Social Security? Why were they doing 
this to a man who was sick? A man who was dying? 
</P>
<P>
Although Social Security officials cannot comment on individual cases, hang-ups 
in processing a claim occur for any number of reasons, says Joe Carlin, Los 
Angeles / West branch chief for the state's Disability Evaluation Division, 
which contracts with Social Security to decide on patient eligibility. 
Typically, analysts request necessary medical records from county hospitals -- 
a process that is at best hit-and-miss, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, on cases where we're dealing with county medical facilities, it is 
a problem getting records," Carlin says. 
</P>
<P>
So disorganized are the records that two years ago a full-time employee named 
David Stewart was stationed at County-USC just to track down missing medical 
reports needed by Social Security officials. Stewart says the million or so 
files stored in the county basement are in constant motion, trundled to various 
clinics as needed by doctors, with laboratory reports and doctors' notations 
being added all the time. "It's amazing . . . the amount of papers that flow 
from one place to another." 
</P>
<P>
In any single case, Carlin says, it is difficult knowing where to pin blame. 
"It's either, A, we didn't get the records, or, B, we got the records and there 
wasn't enough detail," he says. "The final possibility is, we did not do the 
case properly." 
</P>
<P>
The benefits claim became a crusade for Hernandez; the sleeplessness, the anger 
swallowed him up. Why? Why? Why? How could they deny him? At one point, he says 
he entered the records room himself, determined to see what his file contained. 
There was nothing about his nerve-damaged leg. But there was a medical report 
concerning a different Hernandez altogether, somebody who was perhaps also 
trying in vain to get his benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Tired, bitterly frustrated, Silvio Hernandez took a T-cell test in the fall of 
1989. The count, previously in the 400s, was now down to 95. 
</P>
<P>
KIMON BEAZLIE SHAVED off his long hair. Like many chemotherapy patients, he 
found it disturbing to see the long locks fall out whenever he showered. He was 
receiving treatments on alternate Thursdays and getting to know members of his 
own treatment group, those who joined him for intravenous therapy in the 
pale-yellow hallway. 
</P>
<P>
One, in particular, became a favorite of Beazlie: a young man named Brian, only 
23, who attended each session with his mother. "You just don't see parents 
here," says Beazlie. The three would pass the time chatting. 
</P>
<P>
Brian began missing days -- he was sometimes too ill to keep his appointments 
-- and eventually, the youngster dropped out of the group. A nurse told him 
that Brian had switched weeks, coming in on the Thursdays when Beazlie was not 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie visited the clinic the following Thursday to look for him, but Brian 
was nowhere to be found. "Finally, I confronted (a nurse), and I said, 'Brian's 
not here, is he?' " Beazlie remembers. "And she said, 'No, he passed away.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Brian's death, Beazlie temporarily dropped out of treatment. He 
packed for a trip to Hungary, where he planned to visit his lover, who was 
working overseas. He also hoped to buy drugs on the European underground. 
</P>
<P>
One question that nearly all AIDS patients ask themselves sooner or later is 
whether they should try medications -- and there are hundreds -- that have not 
yet been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. In recent years, 
liberalized policies have made many of those medications available in 
experimental trials at clinics such as 5P21; and yet the underground remains 
vitally active. Rumors percolate through all levels of the gay community about 
interferon treatments developed in Africa or purported wonder-drugs 
manufactured only in Japan. Such drugs are imported to the United States, but 
many patients find them dismally disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the '20s speak-easies," Beazlie says of the medication underground. 
"Someone might say to you, 'Get in touch with so-and-so, he's involved in it.' 
And you go to someone's house and say, 'Joe sent me.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the States, Beazlie had not found anything on the underground to effectively 
combat Kaposi's sarcoma. On the trip to Hungary, all he managed to pick up was 
a German-made drug called Balachek, an elixir fortified with minerals that cost 
$1 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
RIC ABEYTIA WAS BACK in the hospital with internal bleeding. Well before his 
scheduled psychiatrist appointment last fall, the Candida had returned. And now 
here he was, sick again, hooked up to IVs, receiving stomach medication that he 
had pleaded for earlier. With bitter solace, he told himself: You were right! 
They didn't listen! 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Fred Sattler, however, the drugs for Candida are never 
prescribed at the earliest onset of the infection, and for good reason: The 
fungus can mutate. Abeytia's attention soon turned to the health of his best 
friend, a once burly, 250-pound college pal who was admitted to the County-USC 
AIDS ward the same month. The 22-bed ward, separate from the crowded outpatient 
clinic, provided his friend with terrific care, Abeytia says. But his friend 
was down to 140 pounds and dying. Even after he returned home, Abeytia and the 
patient's mother took turns at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed very common-sense things," Abeytia says, recalling those 
conversations with his friend. " 'What do we do about the funeral?' 'What do we 
do about your house?' 'How about your car?' 'Is the will taken care of?' And at 
the same time I was trying to be as comforting to him as possible because he 
was very scared. I'd crawl into bed with him and just hold him, just to try to 
make him feel a little better." 
</P>
<P>
The friend returned to the hospital the first week of December. He slipped into 
a coma and died five days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"I CANNOT WALK,I cannot sleep, I'm having diarrhea at night in bed. I cannot 
control my bowels. I have to start using diapers like a baby." 
</P>
<P>
That is how Silvio Hernandez describes his medical condition as of late last 
year. He had developed mixed emotions about the health care at 5P21. He 
appreciated the apparently sincere efforts of his doctor to help him, and yet 
he was rushed in and out so fast -- five or 10 minutes, on most visits -- that 
he did not really understand what was being done for him or why. 
</P>
<P>
And he wondered whether his doctor even understood what treatments he needed 
most. "There are just so many people," he says ruefully. "The system is just so 
overworked." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez stopped taking the bus from West Hollywood to 5P21, relying instead 
on volunteers from AIDS-assistance organizations to drive him. It was the Los 
Angeles-based Minority AIDS Project that now intervened in his nearly year-old 
battle for Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
That organization put Hernandez in touch with the office of State Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles), where an administrative assistant named Lynn Shepodd 
took charge. She saw Hernandez's case as "an abomination." 
</P>
<P>
"They were asking him to jump through all these hoops and I just couldn't 
figure out why," Shepodd recalls. "Every time he would go to a doctor, they 
would either misplace his records or they'd tell him he had to go see someone 
else. He was just so tired and worn out. He just called (our office) in 
desperation." 
</P>
<P>
Sheppod's telephone calls were effective. Four days after Christmas, 1989, 
Hernandez was asked to visit the West Los Angeles Social Security office on 
Hollywood Boulevard. He grins as he remembers the office manager meeting him at 
the door. "They apologized 15 times," Hernandez says. "They say, 'This is not 
the way (we) operate.' They wanted to know who I was that they received three 
calls from Sacramento. I say, 'I am nobody. I am just a poor man that works 
very hard, and I have a disease that I don't know how long I'm going to live. 
And I need my money NOW.' " 
</P>
<P>
He got it -- a check for $630. Two weeks later, he got a second check for 
$7,755.53, representing retroactive Social Security payments for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez sent Shepodd a dozen roses in a gold box. 
</P>
<P>
AT DR. PETER KENNEDY'S Wilshire Boulevard office, the physician and his 
patient, Tim Walsh, had a confrontation. If he didn't go back into the 
hospital, the doctor told him last December, he was going to die. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh had picked up a bacterial pneumonia and had been eluding the doctor 
during office visits, obtaining drug prescriptions from a nurse and skipping 
out, even though he was rapidly losing weight, Kennedy says. Walsh entered the 
hospital and soon was hovering near death. For two days during the holidays, he 
went home, a sojourn that required 24-hour nursing care; once, as he tried to 
walk, he fell while connected to an intravenous needle, spilling blood in the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the hospital stay was over, Walsh was connected with a subclavian 
catheter -- a tube under the collarbone that enabled him to administer his own 
intravenous medications. Through that tube, he took antibiotics, a hormone to 
boost red blood cells and a high-calorie mixture of protein, carbohydrates and 
vitamins -- home therapies generally difficult to get through the public health 
system. "I'm sure (the nutritive mixture) kept him alive at times," Kennedy 
says. 
</P>
<P>
All of this, the drugs, the coughing, the IV tubes that Walsh wore to bed, was 
taking a toll on Ron Satora. Still asymptomatic, Walsh's lover carried the 
burden of nearly all the work at home, from feeding the two cats to fetching 
cold towels for Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
It was Satora's nature to keep his frustrations in him, bottled up. His doctors 
were now prescribing larger and larger doses of anti-depressants. Occasional 
temper tantrums -- the venting of those clamped emotions -- were punctuated 
this spring by an attack in which his blood pressure shot up and his heart rate 
leaped to 250. He temporarily lost his eyesight and he was rushed to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Nerves. Just nerves. "It's all on my shoulders," Satora says. 
</P>
<P>
AS THE SUMMER ARRIVED, anger and frustration mounted. Furious activists shouted 
down the federal health and human services secretary at yet another 
international AIDS conference where medical progress seemed dim. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, early in the year, had authorized the hiring of additional 
medical personnel to reduce the waiting list at 5P21 to only two or three 
weeks, Sattler says. But for several months the positions were not advertised, 
Sattler says, and have remained unfilled, in largely because county salaries 
are far below those in private health-care. 
</P>
<P>
The personal battles, too, wore on: 
</P>
<P>
* Silvio Hernandez adds to his videotape collection, fretting over his health. 
He has lost 40 pounds -- down to 125. Lately, letters have been arriving from 
Social Security saying the agency has overpaid him, one demanding a refund of 
$27, another a refund of $98. 
</P>
<P>
"It is confusing. What is going on, I don't know," Hernandez says. "They make 
so many mistakes. I don't know what I'm supposed to receive every month any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
* Tim Walsh was back in the hospital for much of June with bacterial pneumonia. 
He was looking very thin in late July, and coughing heavily. His speech is 
slurred and he complains of tiredness; his doctor talks pessimistically about 
the chances of real improvement. Satora, meanwhile, took an 11-day vacation in 
Hawaii alone, at the insistence of his own doctor. "I worry too much," he said 
as he packed for the airport. "There have been times I felt like I don't know 
how much longer I can deal with this. But I don't think I could ever leave 
him." 
</P>
<P>
* Kimon Beazlie, the one-time rock climber and Hollywood costume designer, is 
very ill at home. Doctors at 5P21 wanted to insert a tube in his chest, similar 
to Walsh's, and to place Beazlie on an alternating schedule of blood 
transfusions and chemotherapy. Instead, Beazlie withdrew himself entirely from 
treatment. In his renegade outlook he asks himself: Why get a transfusion one 
week when chemotherapy would destroy your new blood the next? 
</P>
<P>
The German drug Balachek had done nothing for him, Beazlie says, talking 
painfully, as if he had just come from the dentist. The sarcoma lesions have 
returned and now fill his whole mouth. He coughs violently. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after taking a visitor through the county clinic, Beazlie now keeps 
to his apartment except to settle last-minute affairs. He is trying to find a 
home for one of his dogs. Two other dogs are so old they probably will be put 
to sleep, he says. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny Monday in late July, Beazlie arranged to be cremated. He talks of 
going on a morphine drip -- the way out for many AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dying, he says, will be an end to pain. 
</P>
<P>
* Ric Abeytia is a healthy man -- or so he feels. Eighteen months after the 
vomiting and internal bleeding that marked his introduction to AIDS, the former 
banker works full time at the offices of Being Alive, a Los Angeles-based help 
group. Abeytia is now on a clinical trial for the experimental drug DDI because 
AZT was causing him too much discomfort. He takes stomach medication when 
necessary and follows the medical bulletins for possible breakthroughs, for 
hope. He was preparing to enter the county AIDS ward for 10 days of treatment 
for a lingering bacterial infection, but he planned to take his briefcase and 
office files with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll make it an office," he says. The work for Being Alive pays one-fourth 
what he made as a banker, but, he says, helping others makes it easier to deal 
with his own illness. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he has his bad days when he's down and depressed and cries like the 
rest of us," says Abeytia's friend, Ian Barrington, who also has AIDS. "We talk 
on days when he can't work, when he's really ill. But I can always count on him 
calling me three or four days later, back on his feet and dancing again. A lot 
of courage."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PASS THE LOOT BY BILL AMEND (ANDREWS &amp; MCMEEL: $7.95)

Bill Amend is a promising young comic strip artist, and this second collection 
of "Fox Trot" shows him beginning to realize his potential. Amend caricatures 
the daily misadventures of Roger and Andrea Fox and their children, Peter, 
Paige and Jason, without resorting to the cliches of the family strip. 
</P>
<P>
The kids fight constantly, as real brothers and sisters do, but Amend also 
reveals their underlying affection for each other. Quincy, Jason's pet iguana, 
doesn't think in cute little symbols; he's just a lizard. The most original 
character in the strip is Denise, Peter's girlfriend, who happens to be blind. 
Independent, resourceful and unapologetic, she's a rare example of a 
handicapped cartoon character who isn't a smarmy role model. The weakest aspect 
of "Fox Trot" is the drawing: Everyone in the strip looks too much alike. 
Sharp-eyed readers will enjoy the in-jokes Amend likes to hide in Roger's 
newspaper, including the headline, "Springsteen to tour with cartoonist."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: STILL SMALL VOICES BY JOHN &amp; JANET WALLACH (CITADEL

Fourteen profiles of Palestinians and Israelis living in the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank. John and Janet Wallach balance their account by interviewing 
subjects who represent a wide spectrum of opinion: a liberal rabbi who works to 
establish dialogues among the citizens of Efrat; Jewish and Islamic 
fundamentalists who believe that the land is God's gift to their people and 
everyone else should convert or leave; a Palestinian journalist whose efforts 
to provide a balanced account of life in the occupied territories have earned 
him the enmity of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the interviews are filled with recriminations, 
rationalizations, accusations, excuses and ingenuous statements about how 
simple the solution to everything could be if only . . . These candid profiles 
make it clear why a peaceful solution to the intifada is unlikely: Both sides 
seem more interested in achieving victory over their foes than in living in 
peace with their neighbors.

I am working on a biography of the Hon. Mary Petrie Victor Bruce, an 
American-English woman who was one of the leading women fliers in the early 
'30s. 
</P>
<P>
She died earlier this month after an eventful life. 
</P>
<P>
She had a great deal of fun with life, which means she may also have had a 
great amount of sorrow. I need any and all information regarding that life. I 
appreciate copies of any stories, letters, documents relating to her. Thank 
you.

THE RIGHT TO WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to Daniel Callahan's review of Laurence Tribe's "Abortion: The 
Clash of Absolutes" (July 22), there can be little doubt that our Constitution 
contains an implied right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But if it is an absolute right, can Mr. Tribe, Mr. Callahan or anyone else 
offer an explanation that makes sense of how laws which prohibit the ingestion 
of drugs into one's own body can be constitutional? 
</P>
<P>
In other words, does the right to privacy permit us -- all of us, men and women 
-- to exercise control over our own bodies or doesn't it? Let's make up our 
minds.

THE ART OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN PETER H. GORDON of the New York State Museum began putting together an 
exhibition of baseball-themed art, he discovered it was a massive task. With 
its thrilling heroics and mesmerizing rhythms, the national pastime has 
captured the imaginations of American artists and writers in a way that, say, 
badminton or even soccer never could. What is it about baseball that makes us 
cherish it so? Curator Gordon has come up with 149 individual answers in 
"Diamonds Are Forever: Artists and Writers on Baseball," up from Aug. 19 
through Oct. 21 at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 700 Prospect St. in La Jolla. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday through Sunday and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday. Admission is $4 for 
adults, $2 for students and senior citizens, 50 cents for children 5 to 12; 
children under 5 free. Admission is free from 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesday. For more 
information, telephone the museum at (619) 454-3541. The exhibition is 
sponsored by the American Express Company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in 
the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, 
filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, 
it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. A. Bartlett Giamatti. "The 
Green Fields of the Mind" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I loved the game," Shoeless Joe went on. "I'd have played for food money. I'd 
have played free and worked for food. It was the game, the parks, the smells, 
the sounds. Have you ever held a bat or a baseball to your face? The varnish, 
the leather." W. P. Kinsella. "Shoeless Joe" 
</P>

This is the power of their faces It is summer, it is the solstice the crowd is 
cheering, the crowd is laughing in detail permanently, seriously without 
thought. William Carlos Williams"At the Ball Game"

Any baseball is beautiful. No other small package comes as close to the ideal 
in design and utility.It is a perfect object for a man's hand. Roger Angell.

Things as critical as this, the selection of a favored baseball team, are not, 
as some suspect, a matter of choice; one does not choose a team as one does not 
select his own genes. They are confirmed upon you, more than we know an act of 
heredity. David Halberstam ."The Fan Divided"

BIG JIM'S SERVES UP HEFTY PORTIONS AND SATISFYING BREAKFASTS 24 HOURS A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times in life when nothing but a 24-hour coffee shop will do. I 
remember having to work the late shift at one job I had: I left at 2 or 3 in 
the morning, too wound up to go to sleep. Only breakfast would help. After all, 
nothing lulls the brain to slumber like a pound of glutinous biscuits and 
gravy. 
</P>
<P>
In my younger days, I'd drink and dance with friends until club closing time; 
then, knowing that a big plate of steak and eggs is excellent hangover 
prevention, we'd head out to an all-night truck stop or diner. 
</P>
<P>
And there were times driving across country when we'd get on a roll and 
wouldn't want to stop, when we kept driving through the wee hours, when we had 
to stop to tank up on gas, coffee and maybe a sweet roll. In such 
circumstances, nothing, nothing, but a 24-hour place will do. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't worked until morning, danced until closing or driven all night 
lately, but I do know exactly which 24-hour place to run to: Big Jim's Family 
Style Restaurant in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Big Jim's isn't all that conceptually different from Denny's or Bob's. There's 
a salad bar, and breakfast served any time you want it. But this is one man's 
-- Big Jim's -- version of a chain restaurant, and thus, one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
The colors throughout the restaurant are those of a deep Western sunset: deep 
yellow, pearly orange, a haunting lavender and sky blue, the same colors that 
appear in the Western paintings of frontiersmen that hang on Big Jim's walls. 
Overhead, in a long trough in the ceiling, Monument Valley is airbrushed. 
(Looking up into that trough of mesas and heady blue sky is dizzying.) There 
are wagon-wheel chandeliers, etched glass and a long, fully stocked aquarium 
separating the booths. (Every now and then, an algae-eating vacuum-mouthed 
plecostomus would come by and suck on the glass inches from my face.) 
</P>
<P>
From my very first visit, I realized that this restaurant is not called Big 
Jim's for nothing. We went for breakfast. My friend ordered steak and eggs, 
which came with three eggs, a big T-bone and great, freshly made hash browns: 
The food literally hung off the sides of the plate. The T-bone was decent, too, 
grilled over mesquite. My Belgian waffles were perfect, light and crunchy. I 
ordered melon and was given an entire half of a honeydew, and not a diminutive 
honeydew, either, but a honeydew larger than my head. "Were all the melons this 
large?" I asked the waitress. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I picked through and found that one for you." 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, this waitress was the kind of waitress songs are written about. 
She took care of us and brought us food, water, coffee. She emptied cooled cups 
of coffee and returned them steaming. She checked in on us, looked us in the 
eye, anticipated our needs. 
</P>
<P>
There is no staunching the amount of food that comes out of the kitchen to the 
table at Big Jim's. An English muffin is really a muffin and a half. A fresh 
spinach omelet could provide minimum daily requirement of protein and iron to 
three grown men. A club sandwich is so large it becomes an eating problem: How 
and where does one get this stratigraphic mass of turkey, bacon, bread, cheese, 
lettuce and tomato into the mouth? 
</P>
<P>
Such abundance is, in ways, psychologically satisfying; it's getting more, 
more, more than I ever wanted. After a particularly stressful morning, a late 
breakfast at Big Jim's is full of customers who clearly clean their plates on a 
regular basis -- big customers. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with breakfast and lunch, dinner at Big Jim's is a disappointment. If 
this is, as the menu proclaims, "good ol' Western homemade cookin,' " it 
doesn't speak well of Western homes. Rather, I'd call it no-nonsense 
truck-stop-style food. Pork chops were small and cooked until leathery; meat 
loaf, though spicy, was a textural washout. The so-called fresh vegetables were 
no doubt fresh once, but the ones I got had grown watery and faded from their 
extended life on the steam table. Dinner comes with baskets of neon orange 
garlic bread, and a trip to the salad bar. 
</P>
<P>
I don't make a practice of eating at salad bars; quite the opposite, in fact. 
But one mouthful of a Big Jim's salad, eaten under that 3-D mural of blue sky 
and red rock formations, somehow gave me a series of ricocheting memories. It 
brought back all the times I've eaten in a coffee shop while trying to diet, of 
the various waitress jobs I held in four different states, of cross-country 
drives during which, crazed for something fresh and green, I'd devour just such 
a salad. I wouldn't make a habit of Big Jim's salad bar, but one night, I liked 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Big Jim's food is utterly generic and familiar, which to many 
people brings its own form of pleasure. And where else can you have a trough 
full of Monument Valley over your head, a plecostomus kissing the glass by your 
face, and one of the world's sweetest waitresses filling your coffee cup?

OPENING OF GIANT DIPPER DRAWS CROWDS TO MISSION BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of people lined up under hazy skies Saturday morning in Belmont Park 
to buy a $2 ticket for their seat on the 65-year-old Giant Dipper roller 
coaster, which many thought would never leave its station house after it was 
derailed in 1976 and threatened with demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The grand re-opening of the wooden coaster, which was built in 1925, almost 
went off without a hitch until a minor brake adjustment shut the coaster down 
for about an hour, leaving some people stranded in line while others left to 
return another day. 
</P>
<P>
But coaster officials said the adjustment was routine and riders were not in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fine," said Tim Cole, assistant manager of the San Diego Seaside Co., the 
people responsible for the $1.2-million coaster restoration. "Like with all new 
rides, you've got to allow a little break-in period." 
</P>
<P>
But when officials got the coaster running again shortly before 1 p.m., the 
shrieks of people being whipped around a half-mile of track at top speeds of 45 
m.p.h. filled the air. Many of the people milling around the Belmont Park shops 
scrambled to get back in line for their shot at a two-minute, hair-raising 
ride. The first 500 people got a complimentary certificate commemorating their 
ride on the Giant Dipper's inaugural day. 
</P>
<P>
The patience of Louis Lopez of San Diego, who waited out the repair work, paid 
off because he got a seat in the front car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great time and it was worth the wait," said the 31-year-old Lopez, 
who hasn't ridden the Giant Dipper since he was about 8. 
</P>
<P>
The influx of people to Mission Beach for the coaster's opening and a 
volleyball tournament forced police to restrict traffic in the area until 
Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"All the parking lots are full," said Sgt. Charles Hogquist of the San Diego 
Police Department. "It's really jam packed with traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The coaster was initially scheduled to open Tuesday but a faulty sprocket 
derailed plans. During the coaster's restoration, officials decided not to 
replace one of the four original sprockets that turn the chain that pulls the 
cars up a 71-foot-hill, and during final testing a few teeth on the sprocket 
chipped. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the three new sprockets was adapted to replace the faulty one and 
another new sprocket was made. Both were installed late this week, said Dana 
Morgan, vice president of San Diego Seaside Co. 
</P>
<P>
With its new hardware in place, the Giant Dipper rolled out of the station 
house about 10:30 a.m. Saturday carrying a load of invited guests on the 
inaugural ride. 
</P>
<P>
On that train was 81-year-old Les Hamm of Santee, who rode the coaster on its 
inaugural day back on the Fourth of July, 1925, when he was 16. It's the only 
roller coaster he's ever ridden. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it this way," said Hamm, trying to catch his breath after he got 
off the ride. "It was well worth waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Because of a lease dispute with the city, the Giant Dipper has been stationary 
since 1976 and faced the threat of demolition as late as 1982. But a volunteer 
army of roller-coaster buffs, calling themselves the Save the Coaster 
Committee, won a three-year lease on the land from the city and were given a 
chance to renovate the structure at West Mission Bay Drive and Mission 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But a passion for roller coasters and a desire to ward off the wrecking ball 
weren't enough to keep paying the bills, so the city suggested the group get 
some help. 
</P>
<P>
A Northern California-based roller-coaster operator, the Santa Cruz Seaside 
Co., formed a joint venture with an amusement-equipment manufacturer to get a 
31-year lease from the city to manage the ride. After a 1987 inspection of the 
coaster, the San Diego Seaside Co. was established and major restoration work 
started. 
</P>
<P>
All of the track has been replaced, along with all 28,973 bolts and much of the 
Douglas fir framework. The coaster also sports a new set of signature colors 
with a pink track, white framework, and a green, 24-seat steel and fiberglass 
train of cars. 
</P>
<P>
What the Giant Dipper might lack in speed and height compared with today's 
metal, high-tech contraptions it makes up for in history. 
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony July 4, the coaster claimed its spot in history along with 
such landmarks as Mission San Diego de Alcala and the Hotel de Coronado when it 
was designated a national historic landmark by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
The Belmont Park Giant Dipper and another Giant Dipper in Santa Cruz, operated 
by the Santa Cruz Seaside Co., are the only two seaside coasters in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Plechner, who recently moved from San Diego to Ashland, Ore., camped out 
overnight at Belmont Park so he could be the first paying customer to ride the 
coaster. 
</P>
<P>
"To miss one of the great events in San Diego would be ridiculous," the 
27-year-old Plechner said. "The mystique and the ambience of the whole area 
creates a certain exhilaration before you even get on the ride." 
</P>
<P>
The coaster will run during the summer from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., except Fridays 
and Saturdays, when it will stay open until 11 p.m.

Your editorial was absolutely right. NIMBY is the name of the tune concerning 
the proposed soup kitchen in North County. ("No Purpose Would Be Served In 
Rejecting Soup Kitchen Site," Aug. 5). 
</P>
<P>
When I buy a home next to an airport and observe airplanes taking off, it's 
reasonable to expect a certain amount of noise, odor and, on occasion, a crash. 
I was aware of the problem when I bought -- that's why the home was so cheap. 
</P>
<P>
When I buy a home next to friendly neighbors, nice atmosphere, no smog, no 
traffic, no crime and winding country roads, I buy because that's the way it 
is, and that's the way I would like it to stay. There was no soup kitchen, and 
I don't want a soup kitchen, make no bones about it.

RECYCLER HEADED FOR TRASH HEAP?; 
</P>
<P>
NO TIME TO LOSE IN HELPING HOME-GROWN COMPANY FIND A PERMANENT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curbside recycling programs, which rank among the best of local innovations, 
were themselves trashed by shortsighted government agencies in two communities 
last week. There is still time to clean up the mess in North County, but the 
city of San Diego may find itself atop a heap of trouble because of its lack of 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In Encinitas, an advisory board recommended against Solana Recyclers' plan to 
expand its quarter-acre site off El Camino Real, despite a sizable increase in 
the amount of paper, glass, aluminum and plastic the organization picks up in 
Encinitas, Del Mar and Solana Beach. Even worse, the board advised the Planning 
Commission not to renew Solana Recyclers' temporary operating permit, a 
decision that would force the 7-year-old organization to soon shut down if the 
Planning Commission and City Council agree. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Solana Recyclers, which started with two UC San Diego students 
and a pickup truck, is a home-grown success story that now employs 25 people 
and collects 450 tons of refuse a month. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, all California cities must, by state law, reduce their trash 
outputs by 25% in the next five years, and by 50% in the next decade. Any 
recommendation that would cause even a temporary disruption of recycling is 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
The panel apparently supports Solana Recyclers' efforts, but wants to force it 
out of a site intended as a temporary home three years ago. The panel believes 
that the recyclers should get serious about finding a permanent site. The 
recyclers say they have looked at 140 parcels in Encinitas alone, without 
finding a suitable one that they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission -- or, if necessary, the City Council -- should extend 
Solana Recyclers' permit. Then the three cities involved and the county (which 
owns the land Solana Recyclers is now leasing) must get together and find this 
invaluable organization a permanent, adequately sized home. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has a bigger problem. With four of its nine members 
absent, the City Council failed Tuesday to muster the five votes needed to put 
before voters an amendment to the People's Ordinance of 1919. 
</P>
<P>
That is the anachronistic charter provision that mandates free trash pickup for 
single family homes. (Apartment and condominium residents already pay to have 
their trash hauled away.) 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners would have paid $8.50 monthly for trash pickup if the amendments had 
been approved, part of which was to expand the city's successful curbside 
recycling pickup program, from the current 80,000 households to 300,000 homes 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
A citywide recycling program could reduce San Diego's trash pile by 5% to 8%. 
But that won't happen, because there's no money for the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Ron Roberts voted against placing the 
amendments on the ballot. We don't agree with their decisions, but at least 
they made choices. Council members Judy McCarty, Bob Filner and John Hartley 
supported the proposal. 
</P>

REASONS FOR RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alleged effort to "recall" Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt because of her vote 
on redistricting is a lame excuse for big-money development interests to 
attempt to discredit a woman who has taken a brilliant leadership role on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bernhardt has challenged and rankled the pro-growth, anti-environmental 
members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
She has worked tirelessly to visualize and introduce proposals to better manage 
growth in this city, and she has been a staunch defender of environmental 
protection. The wealthy special interests don't like the fact that she was 
elected, or that she has become an effective leader. 
</P>
<P>
If there are any "community leaders" who are supposedly organizing a recall (it 
looks to me like a well-financed effort by builders and pro-growth political 
consultants), they should understand that they are lining up with 
anti-environmental bigwigs who are miffed because they can't control the 
council as they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the redistricting issue is a deception not just to attack Linda 
Bernhardt, but the first salvo in a crusade by the megabucks developers against 
district elections. I appeal to the voters in the 5th District NOT to sign 
petitions against Linda Bernhardt.

REFLECTIONS: 'THE REACTION FROM GIRLS WAS AMAZING . . . . I WOULD FALL IN LOVE 
FOUR TIMES A WEEK.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Back in the late 1960s, when Joe Miazgowicz was a student at the University of 
Michigan, he learned that his best friend had been turned down by every campus 
band. So they created their own band: Leaves of Grass. Miazgowicz was the 
rhythm guitarist for the highly popular rock 'n' roll campus band, which played 
a wide range of music from Chuck Berry to Bob Dylan to Wilson Pickett. After 
graduation, members went their separate ways. They last played together in 
1973. Miazgowicz moved from Ann Arbor to Encinitas, where he now runs a 
business, Juicer Plants, and referees professional ice hockey games. Last month 
Miazgowicz, 41, dusted off his guitar for an "amazing experience," when his 
fellow band members flew in to play a reunion concert at MiraCosta College. 
Miazgowicz spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather and was photographed by 
Barbara Martin Pinhero. 
</P>
<P>
We all met in the dorms as freshmen. There were a couple of other guys who 
liked to play music, so it became a ritual every night after dinner. We played 
for an hour or so, old Beatles songs, jug band music, crazy stuff like that. 
Only I guess back then they weren't old Beatles songs. Near the end of the 
school year, Rhone Bourdages, who was on the same floor as me, started 
auditioning for campus bands, but he couldn't get in. At that point we decided 
that when we got back to school we would put together our own band. 
</P>
<P>
Rhone came up with the name of the band right out of his English class. "Leaves 
of Grass" is Walt Whitman's book. It certainly had other connotations, which 
fit right in for the times. 
</P>
<P>
So we came back the fall of '67 and it was real grim at first. We were not very 
good at all, but we had fun. We started getting some jobs later that fall. Our 
first was a fraternity mixer, that fall in '67 during the football season. We 
also played T.G.I.F. afternoon mixers. That was our training ground there, just 
kick out the jams for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
It was real exciting. The other guys had played in bands before and I hadn't, 
so they taught me rock 'n' roll professionalism, you can't let them know when 
you're upset, keep playing, just muscle through even when you don't know 
things. I was in awe. It was great having people dance to our music. 
</P>
<P>
Having the reaction from girls was amazing. That was like a gift from heaven. I 
was only just into it for the fun, but what a bonus! I would fall in love four 
times a week. There were beautiful girls all over the place. Our popularity 
grew pretty slowly, but we were one of the best campus bands by the time we 
graduated. In our last couple of years, we traveled all over Michigan during 
the summers. Graduation was the thing that disbanded us. 
</P>
<P>
We've all stayed in touch over the years. Rhone and I were probably the closest 
and I hadn't seen him in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Our reunion was amazing. I was the only one who had a couple of tapes from way 
back when. We listened to a couple of them. We were like, oh man, do you 
remember this song? I think so, do you remember the words? I don't think so. 
But when we started playing them and, like bicycle riding time, they were just 
there all of a sudden. As soon as we started, there it was. The harmonies were 
right there. We knew all the words. There were a few glitches and we worked 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
People liked us a lot. We played for the students and they all liked it. We 
also played a party and there were a few people who were official Deadheads. 
They went nuts. They said, you guys are all right! We did a lot of different 
songs and we did quite a bit of our old original stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I have a wife and two kids here, we all have families, jobs and commitments, so 
it would be hard to keep the band together. But something like this every once 
in awhile would be great. A month ago, I never thought something like this was 
possible, but now that we've done it, we can do it again in the future.

ATLANTA ZOO, ONCE AN ANIMAL CONCENTRATION CAMP, GAINS SOME RESPECT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE DIRECTOR IS CREDITED FOR A TURNAROUND DURING HIS SIX-YEAR 
TENURE. THE PARK IS HALFWAY THROUGH A $50-MILLION RENOVATION. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when the Atlanta zoo was regarded as a kind of animal 
concentration camp. One keeper ate rabbits from the petting zoo, and other 
animals lived and died there in unnatural ways. 
</P>
<P>
All that was before Director Terry Maple came along with his imagination and 
enthusiasm and organizational skills. Six years later and halfway through a 
$50-million renovation, the zoo is respected in the zoological world, and Terry 
Maple is a very tired man. 
</P>
<P>
"This zoo has been enormously difficult to build. It has taxed me in every 
imaginable way. It has taken every ounce of energy I've had," Maple, 43, said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie B. probably does not appreciate the effort, though he has benefited from 
it. The popular lowland gorilla, named for former Mayor William B. Hartsfield, 
lived alone in a cage for 27 years. Now he lives in a lush, jungle-like 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
There are new displays of flamingos and rhinos; a Masai Mara exhibit for 
giraffes, lions and elephants; a replica of the Indonesian rain forest for 
orangutans; a Sheba Sumatran tiger forest, where tigers will be bred under the 
auspices of the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened those exhibits fast and furious. We recovered faster than any zoo 
ever recovered. And the pace was painful," Maple said. 
</P>
<P>
But the growth period was not as painful as the zoo's situation at the time 
Maple arrived. Parade magazine had rated the zoo one of the 10 worst in the 
nation. Just $10,000 was budgeted each year for zoo maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Twinkles, a 15-year-old elephant, died while on loan to a traveling circus in 
North Carolina. In addition to the rabbits that wound up on the keeper's dinner 
table, at least eight other zoo animals perished. The decapitated body of a 
baboon was found in a dump truck. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to Zoo Atlanta, but Maple and his staff envisioned more 
than that. They wanted to build a firm foundation of support. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in Friends of Zoo Atlanta has swelled from 5,000 to more than 
53,000, making it the fifth-largest nonprofit zoo support group in the country, 
said Cheryl Moody, director of membership. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance has risen and is expected to exceed 900,000 visitors this year, up 
from about 260,000 in 1984. Adult ticket prices have climbed from $2.50 to 
$6.75. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's budget, less than $1 million in 1984, is $7.7 million this year, and 
the staff has been expanded to 115 from 40. 
</P>
<P>
After ending 1989 with a $48,000 deficit, the zoo is on the verge of operating 
in the black, said business manager Dennis Baker. This year's goal is amassing 
a $500,000 surplus to help the zoo weather the lean winter months. 
</P>
<P>
All this requires a kind of showmanship that has become a fact of life for 
modern zoos. Recent promotions for Zoo Atlanta included Father's Day at the 
Zoo, the chance to adopt a lovebird on Valentine's Day, and a "summer beach 
party" in February, billed as the Zoo Atlanta Beach Bash. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's progress has not gone unnoticed. It has regained its membership in 
the zoological parks association and has been widely praised by zoo 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry Maple is a natural leader, and he has an incredible commitment to 
wildlife and wild places," said Robert Wagner, executive director of the 
association. "He has brought those things as well as his incredible enthusiasm 
to Zoo Atlanta, and all have just fallen into place behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Llewellyn Haden, chairman of the zoo's governing board, said, "He, in many 
ways, is the zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Maple, a psychology professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who had 
served as deputy director and curator of the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, said 
his tenure is something of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
He had intended to stay three months, he said, but "I got sidetracked into 
building a local zoo." Now he is considering going back to academic life so he 
can have time for his family and to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not writing my resignation," he said. "I am totally committed to this 
place. The question is, 'Can the old zoo director squeak out a book somehow and 
still be zoo director?' There are not enough hours in the day." 
</P>
<P>
In the same breath, Maple also spoke of the challenges that lie ahead for the 
zoo. Besides financial challenges and promotional challenges, there are the 
bear exhibits -- an embarrassment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly an animal welfare issue," Maple said. "They're one of the last 
vestiges of the old zoo. It's hard to accept that they exist."

<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Navy man was killed early Saturday morning when he lost control 
of his car and was thrown from it, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
His passengers, who were also ejected from the vehicle, sustained moderate to 
major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The man was heading east on Route 94 at 4:10 a.m. near Melody Road in Jamul 
when he ran off the right shoulder of the road. He overcorrected, causing the 
car to flip several times. Neither the driver nor the passengers were wearing 
seat belts. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. The three passengers 
were taken to Mercy and Sharp hospitals.

<P>
A San Diego gang detail detective fired shots at an armed 17-year-old male 
Friday evening, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was not injured during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives were responding to a call at 6:23 p.m. of gunshots at 155 South 
Meadowbrook Drive. Upon arriving at the intersection of Meadowbrook Drive and 
Skyline, the detectives saw a gunfight among three males and a vehicle driving 
away from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives then tried to question three males, one of whom was armed, about 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
After identifying themselves as police officers, the youth aimed the gun at an 
officer and the officer fired several rounds. The youth dropped the gun and ran 
but was caught by the officers.

Police are searching for a full-size white Ford pick-up truck after a person 
driving a truck hit and repeatedly ran over two men yesterday, a police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were leaving the Aztec Inn bar at 26th and National Avenue at 1:36 
a.m. Saturday when the driver drove up on the sidewalk and struck them. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then went around the block and drove over the victims two more 
times. The suspect also attempted to hit other pedestrians. The victims, one 
suffering broken bones in his face and the other with a fractured right arm, 
badly scraped leg and a possible concussion, were taken to Mercy Hospital for 
treatment. The two men are in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident may have been a continuation of an argument that began 
inside the bar.

<P>
Anti-abortion lawyer Cyrus Zal appeared at San Diego County Jail Friday 
prepared to start serving his sentence for contempt, but jail officials did not 
have the proper paperwork to admit him. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, 42, a Folsom-based lawyer who was cited for contempt 20 times during a 
trial last February by El Cajon Municipal Judge Larrie R. Brainard after being 
warned not to discuss abortion, had yet to be admitted to County Jail by 8 p.m. 
Saturday night, said a jail official. 
</P>
<P>
Zal was to serve a 290-day sentence for bringing up abortion during the trial 
of six abortion foes accused of trespassing at a La Mesa clinic Oct. 21. The 
six were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, former general counsel for the militant anti-abortion group Operation 
Rescue, has said that he would "gladly" serve the sentence to bring attention 
to the issue of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the California Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Zal.

SHELDON AND ART: THE MINISTER MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR AFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Ministers Square Off Over Provocative Art Exhibit" (Aug. 3): Once again the 
Rev. Lou Sheldon (I used the term ever so loosely) is raking muck and slinging 
morally right mud where he sees it is needed most. 
</P>
<P>
However, this time it's in a location outside of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Well, isn't that special. Santa Monica won't stand for it and well they 
shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
For Sheldon to want to limit the rights of Westside residents to view art or 
limit the role of funding of any artist is just plain fascism at work, not to 
mention throwing the First Amendment right out the window. 
</P>
<P>
I just love it when ministers and all the rest of their ilk square off over 
issues that nearly always restrict the rights and liberties of the general 
public. It just serves to remind those of us aware individuals that true 
concern for humanity comes with a mature respect for the differences.

'FIRM ACCUSED OF DEPOSIT FRAUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud the efforts of the Consumer Protection Unit of the Orange County 
district attorney's office in continuing the efforts against landlords who 
retain security deposits illegally ("O.C. Rent Firm Is Accused of Deposit 
Fraud," Aug. 1). 
</P>
<P>
Your readers should be aware that the Consumer Protection Unit has handled 
similar cases in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a similar situation was brought to our attention. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord, who had 13 properties throughout Orange County, immediately 
corrected the rental agreement and attempted to contact every previous tenant 
in the past four years to refund any security deposit due to them. In fact, 
about $30,000 in refunds were made. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was impossible to find all of the previous tenants, the landlord 
also paid $200,000 to the district attorney's office in a restitution fund in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
That money was to be used primarily for the investigation and prosecution of 
housing cases, i.e., retaining security deposits illegally, substandard housing 
or housing not up to code, and housing discrimination. In addition, the 
landlords agree to pay $150,000 in civil penalties to the county. 
</P>
<P>
I was the deputy district attorney who handled that case where there was an 
estimated 4,000 violations. 
</P>
<P>
It is my hope that the district attorney's office can establish a hot line for 
reporting housing problems and take fast action by using some of the $200,000 
in the fund set up for prosecution of housing issues. 
</P>
<P>
Too few tenants know their rights or where to turn for help. Had the district 
attorney's office established such a hot line in January, think how many 
alleged victims of the Elerding Properties might have been saved.

'A DEADLY COLLISION': RESTRICTIONS NEEDED ON TRACTOR-TRAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening of the Interstate 405 car-pool lane, between John Wayne Airport and 
the El Toro Y, was a joyous occasion for myself and my 2- and 3-year-old sons. 
We had anticipated a relaxing and time-saving ride each day between our home in 
Mission Viejo and their day-care school in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the realistic outcome has been somewhat like an amusement park's 
"ride from hell and back" each day. Motorists utilizing the commuter lane 
apparently do not understand that the 55-m.p.h. speed limit, applicable in most 
of our state, still applies to them. 
</P>
<P>
During the few weeks the car-pool lane has been open, we have been honked at, 
flipped obscene gestures, passed on the left meridian and flashed by 
headlights. I could possibly understand this harassment if I was only obeying 
the law and traveling at a speed of 55 m.p.h.; however, my average speed, to 
avoid being shot at, has been 65 m.p.h.

SHAME ON COUNTY'S DOCTORS? NO, SHAME ON STATE'S MEDI-CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Medi-Cal Rejection in County Shameful" (July 29): 
</P>
<P>
Shame on doctors and hospitals for refusing to treat Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on Medi-Cal for doing anything it can not to pay its fair share to 
physicians and hospitals (and home health agencies and durable medical 
equipment suppliers and pharmacies and many other providers) and for taking 
months and months to pay whatever they finally do. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on the supervisor who said in public, "Why should we (County of Orange) 
pay hospitals more money because you are required to accept patients and have 
no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Shame on Medi-Cal officials who tried to force Medi-Cal contracts on hospitals 
by tying them to the acceptance of county-administered Proposition 99 funds. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on Medi-Cal, which pays hospitals an average of 61% of the cost of 
providing services and readily admits it doesn't care what our costs are. And, 
to add insult to injury, Medi-Cal usually asks for monies back at year-end. 
</P>
<P>
You said, "Some state officials are befuddled and annoyed." 
</P>
<P>
Well, so are the people who have to meet payroll and other items to keep a 
business operating in a viable condition. 
</P>
<P>
What other business can survive by collecting just over 60% of its costs? 
</P>
<P>
In what other business can one obtain a product or service without paying on 
the spot? 
</P>
<P>
You are correct in that there is no "miracle cure" or easy answer to a complex 
problem, but the shame is shared by everyone in our society. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe having Orange County an "open area" would work in today's environment. 
It's worth a try to find out before the entire system falls apart.

'PAIR DIED AS THEY LIVED -- METHODICALLY': WERE COUPLE'S LIVES TOO STERILE TO 
BEAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading with great interest about the suicides of Douglas and Dana 
Ridenour ("Pair Died as They Lived -- Methodically," Aug. 3), I'm left with 
some unanswered questions about their life together, a well-ordered life to be 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
While they climbed the ladder to apparent success, did it lean against any kind 
of supportive system in their emotional and personal lives? The word "friends" 
is glaringly missing as "co-workers, relatives and neighbors" gave their 
impressions of the couple. 
</P>
<P>
The Ridenours' preference seemed not to encourage relationships outside 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible that despite their attempt to lead excessively controlled, 
sterile lives, they came to the conclusion it lacked real meaning? 
</P>
<P>
Were they very lonely in spite of their dependence on each other? 
</P>
<P>
Where did they go for holidays? 
</P>
<P>
What made them laugh? 
</P>
<P>
What did they give? 
</P>
<P>
The article stated they were not religious. While a lot of people do not 
prescribe to an organized affiliation, they are still enhanced by a spiritual 
life, an inherent desire to reach out to others in need, and they are rewarded 
with an enrichment that the pursuit of materials goods cannot replace. 
</P>
<P>
Today's society encourages us to be status conscious, independent in direct 
contrast to our basic human needs for interdependence, and support for each 
other in the community. 
</P>
<P>
It is my opinion that it was not really a fear of growing old that prompted 
their decision to die together, but perhaps realizing the possibility of a 
meaningless life ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
They worked hard for society's stamp of approval that announced them as 
successful, in control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
None of this seemed to bring them the happiness that seemingly eluded them. 
Love does not kill.

<P>
When the news first broke that Douglas and Dana Ridenour had killed themselves, 
everyone was shocked and confused. And well they should be. 
</P>
<P>
To all appearances, the Ridenours did have "everything going for them" -- 
except that they feared failure, growing old, getting ill, being dependent, 
losing control. No one likes these things, but most people are willing to 
accept them as part of life. 
</P>
<P>
Most people are also willing to accept that just as we had no say in being born 
into this world (which is the ultimate lack of control), we will have no say 
about when we will leave it. 
</P>
<P>
Suicide is always tragic for one reason or another. Usually people kill 
themselves when they see it as the only escape from a hopeless situation. It's 
obviously no solution, but people can often sympathize with the victim. 
</P>
<P>
But this "rational" approach to killing one's self is tragic because to opt out 
for reasons of fear shows how pitiable and empty a life can be even when 
everything looks good from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Dianne Klein ("It May Take a Poet to Explain Baffling Murder-Suicide," 
Aug. 3) is right in saying only a poet could explain the Ridenours' actions. 
</P>
<P>
Really good poets have always been able to expound on the deepest movements of 
the human heart, including fear and cowardice.

'BOARD SHUNS PARENTS ON POWER LINE TESTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the article "Board Shuns Parents on Power Line Tests" (Aug. 1), two 
major points were misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
First, the letter from the school board did not state that no testing would be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
It only notified attorney Allen Brandt that the district would not trade 
testing for his dropping the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, I stated to the reporter that another meeting was scheduled between 
county health officials and the district to determine what course of action, if 
any, should be taken. That meeting is still planned and should have been 
reported in the article. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley School District and its Board of Trustees are concerned 
about the potential health hazards and are pursuing the issue with the proper 
authorities -- health officials from the state and county. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has a proven record of protecting the health and safety of 
its students and staff. We were one of the first districts to remove all 
asbestos from our buildings; we adopted the first comprehensive policy in the 
county on AIDS, and we have high-quality procedures and supplies in case of 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
In each of those instances, we carefully assessed the information and proceeded 
with intelligence and concern. We will follow the same careful process in 
resolving this issue.

POTENTIAL INDUCTEES FORM A LONG LIST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan are officially in the Hall of Fame, the 
question becomes: Who's next in line for baseball immortality? 
</P>
<P>
The qualifications for a spot in Cooperstown have become a sticky subject 
lately. Some say the standards have softened, and the game's all-time greats 
just aren't as great as they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
The formation of a veterans committee has allowed players to sneak in who 
couldn't get by the writers after 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The writers would prefer the veterans committee limit its selections to 
umpires, front office types and members of the Negro Leagues who were denied a 
shot at the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer won 268 games and made it in his first year of eligibility. Gaylord 
Perry totaled 314 victories (265 losses) and was squeezed out in his first two 
years on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I as good as Cy Young? Of course not. Am I as good as some of the pitchers 
in the Hall of Fame," Palmer said. "Probably not. But I would have voted for 
myself. It's nice to be part of that ilk." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Jim Bunning missed by four votes because nine writers left their 
ballots blank in a statement of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
It was once thought that 300 victories was an automatic invitation to the Hall 
of Fame, along with 500 home runs, 3,000 hits and 3,000 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Palmer deserved to go to the Hall of Fame," Perry said. "But looking at 
his record, some other people like Ferguson Jenkins and Jim Bunning should get 
in, too." 
</P>
<P>
Perry staggered his way to 300 wins, bouncing from one team to another in an 
effort to hang on. There's also the problem of his use of the greaseball. Some 
voters consider it a form of treason. 
</P>
<P>
When the voting is announced in January 1991, it seems likely Rod Carew will 
make it on his first try because of his 3,053 hits and .328 lifetime average. 
</P>
<P>
Rollie Fingers, baseball's all-time save leader with 341, will also appear on 
the ballot for the first time. His standing with the writers will be an 
indication of the chances for Bruce Sutter, Sparky Lyle and Rich Gossage. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there's the guys who have come close the last few years like Perry, 
Jenkins (284-226, 3,192 strikeouts) and Bunning (224-184, no-hitters in each 
league). 
</P>
<P>
"The Hall of Fame doesn't mean as much to me now," Perry said. "The first year 
I was really anticipating something. Now, it will be nice if I get in but it's 
not something I'm thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
If Perry fails the next couple of years, he may never get in because the field 
will be so strong for the rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
On deck as potential Hall of Famers are Tom Seaver, Don Sutton, Steve Carlton, 
Nolan Ryan, Reggie Jackson, Mike Schmidt, Carlton Fisk, Tommy John, Gary 
Carter, Bert Blyleven, Ozzie Smith, Tony Perez, George Brett, Wade Boggs, 
Rickey Henderson, Robin Yount, Dale Murphy, Dave Winfield, Jim Rice, Bob Boone 
and Dave Parker. 
</P>
<P>
It seems a lock that Seaver, Carlton, Ryan, Jackson, Schmidt, Fisk, Brett, 
Boggs and Henderson will make it when first eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there is Pete Rose. Until his banishment from baseball last 
August and jail sentence last month, baseball's all-time hit leader figured to 
achieve one of the highest voting percentages in history when eligible in 1992, 
along with Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
But several voting members of the Baseball Writers Association of America are 
undecided on whether Rose merits induction on his first try -- if ever. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lost just about everything he's had," Morgan said. "The question is: Is 
he going to lose his Hall of Fame seat? 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the writers to decide. I didn't know how you voted until after I 
was voted in," he said. "Integrity, character, ability and contribtions to the 
team. In a couple of those areas I don't think there's any question about Pete 
Rose. A couple you can question. The point is how much weight does each one 
carry."

ATHLETICS TONE DOWN ACT AND TURN UP PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MASKE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The term "Bash Brothers" rarely is heard around the Oakland Athletics' 
clubhouse these days, for the A's of 1990 are just as enamored with their 
scrappy, irritating "Rickey Runs" as with turning baseballs into distant 
souvenirs. They are even prouder of their Bob Welch and Scott Sanderson 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, little has changed here in three years. The refrain is 
familiar: The A's swagger, and the A's win. "We're the best team in baseball, 
and we know it," Jose Canseco said. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland last was more than three games out of first place in the American 
League West in 1987. The A's have been in first place for all but 10 days of 
this season, with their 70-42 record after Thursday's win over the Baltimore 
Orioles the major leagues' best. 
</P>
<P>
They are on track for their second 100-victory year in three seasons -- ahead 
of the 1988 pace that produced a club-record 104 wins -- and they have begun to 
proclaim in their usual manner that they are readying for a mid-August push 
that will leave the pesky Chicago White Sox out of contention even before the 
stretch run arrives. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to crank it up a few notches here and see if anyone can stay with 
us," Canseco said, mindful that the A's have played .675 baseball in August and 
September the past two seasons. "This is our time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even if the appearance is similar, the personality of this team is not the 
same as the club that first nestled into its place of dominance in 1988. Those 
A's were young and brash, a talented group of newcomers to the art of winning 
stylishly who craved attention for every flex. A forearm bash accompanied every 
home run, and there was no need to exhibit much grit. Their task was to 
overwhelm, and their goal was adulation. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing happened to that team on its way to immortality. It lost the 
World Series in a five-game embarrassment to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the 
beloved underdogs of Orel Hershiser and hobbling hero Kirk Gibson. Things 
haven't been the same for the A's since. 
</P>
<P>
"That changed this team forever," Manager Tony La Russa said. "That's probably 
the best thing that ever happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat steeled the A's, and the renewed vigor that accompanied the onset of 
their spring training in 1989 still hasn't receded. 
</P>
<P>
The occasional boastfulness of Canseco, Rickey Henderson and Dave Stewart now 
is more for show, La Russa contends. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when they believed all the stuff they said. Now it's for you 
guys," La Russa said. "Between the foul lines, this is as mature and 
professional a ballclub as you'll ever find." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco still is often outlandish, as when he taunted his across-the-Bay 
nemesis, Will Clark, with his five-year, $23.5-million contract. Henderson 
still is a potential malcontent, as when he followed Canseco's deal by 
insisting he is underpaid at over $3 million per year. Stewart still can seem 
bitter or begrudging. 
</P>
<P>
But from the first to final pitch of a ballgame, there is no frivolity or 
friction. The forearm bashing and accompanying nickname are infrequent 
ornaments now. Canseco's once-common on-field lapses are rarely seen. 
Henderson's one-time staple of flamboyance in the outfield, the snatch catch, 
makes only an occasional appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be overlooked, of course, is the fact that Oakland's talent remains the 
game's best. Strong cases likely will be made at year's end for Canseco, 
Henderson and Dennis Eckersley as the AL's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco has 34 home runs and 82 RBI. Henderson has a league-leading .330 
average and is among the AL's top 10 in nine other offensive categories. 
Eckersley had 37 saves in 38 chances and had surrendered only 26 hits, three 
walks and four earned runs in 50 1-3 innings. Oakland's pitching staff led the 
league entering Thursday's game with a 3.15 ERA, to 3.49 for the next-best 
White Sox. The A's have 131 homers, second best in the AL to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of teams have talent," La Russa said. "I don't even think we have the 
best talent in the division this year. I thought before the season Kansas City 
and California had more than us. ... Talent goes up and down. We don't. We've 
been a consistently good team for three years. That tells you we have more than 
talent. We have commitment, and we do things right." 
</P>
<P>
The A's move runners along, make the right decisions and execute the 
fundamentals. They learned to scrap last season, when they became world 
champions despite a rougher-than-expected ride that included extended stretches 
without Canseco, Eckersley and Mark McGwire, who were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's acquisition in a June 1989 trade with the New York Yankees added 
fire and a new dimension -- the ability to score routinely with a walk, stolen 
base, groundout and fly ball. The A's still intimidate, but with ceaseless 
precision and newly discovered perseverance rather than with words or antics. 
</P>
<P>
"You come here, and you know you have to play almost a perfect game to beat 
these guys," Orioles pitcher Jeff Ballard said. "If you make many mistakes -- 
mentally, physically, pitching-, or hitting-wise -- you won't win against this 
team. It's a lot of pressure to have that on your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's stability is organization-wide. The Haas family was responsible for 
keeping baseball in the city after purchasing the team from Charlie Finley in 
1980. The franchise they bought had a faltering minor-league system, six 
front-office employees and 187 losses over the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Now the A's have become perhaps baseball's most civic-minded club and possess 
one of the game's most respected executives in General Manager Sandy Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
Alderson has been criticized for his spending sprees -- culminating with a 
three-year, $1.2-million deal last month with top draft choice Todd Van Poppel 
-- but he countered: "Look who's criticizing me. Not people who are winning 95 
to 100 games a year and drawing 2.5 million fans." 
</P>
<P>
The A's are "a step or two ahead of everyone else," Detroit Tigers Manager 
Sparky Anderson said recently. "They have a great foundation, and that can't 
help but show on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Said La Russa: "It's a stable operation, top to bottom. You might question the 
wisdom of keeping me around so long, but otherwise it's hard to find fault with 
the way this front office has conducted itself in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa, with an analytical style true to his status as a lawyer, is regarded 
as among the premier managers. Then there is the resident genius, pitching 
coach Dave Duncan. When Oakland pitchers talk of Duncan, it is with awe. 
Stewart credits Duncan with helping to turn him from a journeyman into 
baseball's top winner over the past three years. Welch credits Duncan with 
making him an All-Star Game starter and the game's victory leader this year at 
18-4. 
</P>
<P>
"He boosts you up mentally more than anything else," Welch said. "With me, he 
took me from thinking about a game in terms of trying to reach the sixth or 
seventh inning to thinking about a game one batter, and one batter only, at a 
time. The guy on deck doesn't even come into my mind any more, and it's made 
all the difference in the world as far as concentration and intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Storm Davis left during the offseason; Sanderson arrived and has become a solid 
performer who has allowed only 13 earned runs in his 11 victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is playing for a better team, but I think I'm a better pitcher 
too," Sanderson said. "This is an environment conducive to success." 
</P>
<P>
It promises to remain that way for at least the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a good run here," Alderson said. "I don't think we'reready for it to 
end. Not for a while yet."

WALNUT ACTIVIST WAGES WATER WAR FROM SUBURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a suburban cul-de-sac in Walnut, Maxine Leichter wages a water war. 
</P>
<P>
Unpaid but working long hours as the Sierra Club's San Gabriel Valley point 
woman, she has moved to the forefront of the fight over cleaning up one of the 
West's worst ground-water pollution problems -- the contamination of the San 
Gabriel Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Leichter, 44, is a relative newcomer to the San Gabriel Valley. She moved from 
West Los Angeles to Walnut in 1988 and got involved with the pollution issue 
last year, but she has already assumed a leading role among San Gabriel Valley 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Using a computer in her home office, Leichter turns out press releases 
assailing local water officials and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the county courthouse in Los Angeles, where a crucial San Gabriel 
Valley water pollution issue was before a judge, she recently declared: "Water 
is power in California. This . . . represents the first time there's been a 
challenge to the water Establishment in the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining her activism, Leichter said: "I was just so disturbed when it looked 
like the (Main San Gabriel Basin) Watermaster would be in control of the 
cleanup and no one seemed to be objecting." 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member watermaster board is seeking court approval to expand its 
authority over how and where water is pumped in the basin. This authority, 
water officials say, is crucial to remedying the contamination because pumping 
affects the flow of underground pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists such as Leichter are afraid that local water officials, 
if they take a supervisory role in the cleanup efforts, may ignore the needs of 
1 million water consumers from Alhambra to La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of those who want the state Legislature to create a regional 
super-agency to oversee the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
At present, no single government entity has the power to supervise and finance 
the pollution remedies, estimated to cost $850 million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In heading the Water Quality Group of the Sierra Club's 58,000-member Angeles 
chapter, Leichter has become conversant in such highly technical but crucial 
documents as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's two-volume "Basinwide 
Technical Plan," released in April. She speaks knowledgeably about the 
one-inch-thick 1973 court decision that resulted in the creation of the Main 
San Gabriel Basin Watermaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be very careful I don't make a mistake," Leichter said. "I'm not 
just speaking for me. I'm speaking for the entire Angeles chapter of the Sierra 
Club." 
</P>
<P>
She often publicly complains about the "old boy network" that runs the water 
companies and agencies in the San Gabriel Valley. But she has earned praise 
from at least one water official who is part of that network. Said Robert G. 
Berlien, a watermaster official and general manager of the Upper San Gabriel 
Valley Municipal Water District: "I have a lot of respect for her. She's more 
informed than most of our critics." 
</P>
<P>
Although she hasn't lived long in the San Gabriel Valley, Leichter, who was 
born in Los Angeles, has spent two decades learning about California water 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from UCLA in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, she 
joined a Westwood group that focused on environmental issues. There she became 
friends with Dorothy Green, who founded Heal the Bay, a group that crusades 
against pollution in Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Leichter said: "A friend told me that there was this new movement, the 
environmental movement, that believed that people needed to live in harmony 
with nature instead of destroying it. This just touched something deep within 
me, and I knew this was what I was going to spend the rest of my life doing." 
</P>
<P>
She became active in land-use fights in the Santa Monica Mountains. In 1980, 
she went on the Sierra Club lecture circuit in the environmentalists' statewide 
battle against the Peripheral Canal. She founded the Los Angeles League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Among environmentalists, Leichter characterizes herself as a moderate. "I 
believe in working within the system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to make the world a better place to live. I always had a real 
love of nature," Leichter said. "The wild places of the world can't look after 
themselves, and they need people to make sure other people don't ruin them." 
</P>
<P>
To her, a good time is taking a winter weekend trip to the Mojave Desert with 
her husband and the Sierra Club's Backroad Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Leichter has held both part-time and full-time jobs, she has spent 
much of her adult life caring for her two children and working as an 
environmental volunteer. She can do her current volunteer work, she said, 
because her husband, a vice president of an import-export firm, can support 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'm embarrassed," Leichter said, "when I meet women who are having a 
career and they get a lot of status and respect and I don't. Volunteers don't 
get the status they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Leichter said, she is comfortable in her adversarial role. "The 
water companies will get away with as much as they can, but we will go on 
fighting," she said.

<P>
In July, 1886, a spark from a passing train set off a wildfire that burned 
10,000 acres of farmland stretching from La Puente to Covina. The fire helped 
put an end to a boom town in the area called Vineland, but in the same location 
eight years later the community of Baldwin Park was established.

RESTAURATEUR DOESN'T WANT 2ND HELPINGS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: JOHN LEONUDAKIS GOT WHAT MANY CONSIDER A SWEET DEAL TO RUN A POSH 
CITY-OWNED RESTAURANT IN IRWINDALE. BUT NOW HE WANTS TO GIVE UP HIS LEASE. 
</P>

IRWINDALE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years and nearly half a million meals after opening the city's fanciest 
restaurant, John Leonudakis wants out. 
</P>
<P>
Since July, the Reno, Nev., businessman has been trying to sell back his lease 
on the swank Rapscallion Seafood House and Bar to the city, which owns it. 
Leonudakis is frustrated with the Irwindale City Council, said John Ekizian, 
Rapscallion's manager and Leonudakis' second in command at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
City officials claim that Leonudakis is unsuccessfully trying to run the 
restaurant from his headquarters in Reno and has reported losing $250,000 a 
year even though the restaurant serves 2,000 meals a week. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, talks are under way between Leonudakis and the city, which may buy 
back the lease for an estimated $350,000, in hopes of negotiating a more 
lucrative agreement with another operator. 
</P>
<P>
If such a settlement is reached, it will close a brief and novel chapter in 
Irwindale's ongoing effort to get the city a nice place to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Located next to an abandoned gravel pit on Irwindale Avenue, Rapscallion is 
acknowledged as the city's most posh restaurant. Surrounded by shrubbery and a 
plush lawn, it sits in contrast to the otherwise bleak Irwindale landscape 
north of the 210 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel pit once was intended to become a stadium for the Los Angeles 
Raiders, and Rapscallion stood to become the fans' No. 1 watering hole. But the 
deal to lure the Raiders to Irwindale fell apart last year. Neither party in 
the current Rapscallion lease negotiations cites the Raiders as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
The city built the restaurant in 1986 for $2.4 million after efforts to woo an 
outside restaurant to Irwindale failed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said it was a matter of pride and practicality. To be taken 
seriously as a business center, Irwindale had to have a serious restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a nice place for our local businessmen to take the people they do 
business with," City Manager Fred Herrera said. Other restaurants have since 
opened in Irwindale, but at the time, Pudgy's, a taco and hamburger stand, was 
about the only place to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Persuading a restaurant chain like Velvet Turtle or Charlie Brown's to open a 
branch in Irwindale -- population 1,100 -- proved impossible, Herrera said, so 
the city chose to build its own facility and asked Leonudakis to run it for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Leonudakis, who did not return numerous phone calls seeking comment, told The 
Times in a 1987 interview that he was initially hesitant about running a 
restaurant in Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't make any sense," Leonudakis said. "I looked at the emptiness of this 
area and I asked myself: 'Where am I going to get the people to work for me? 
Where am I going to get the customers?' " 
</P>
<P>
But the city's offer to lease the restaurant to Leonudakis at an extremely 
favorable price persuaded him to take the chance. In March, 1987, Rapscallion 
opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Leonudakis and the City Council clashed. 
</P>
<P>
The city had originally budgeted $2 million to build, furnish and equip the 
restaurant. When the final figures were in, however, costs totaled $2.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The city placed much of the blame for the cost overrun on the lavish 
furnishings Leonudakis had used to decorate the restaurant, including a 20-foot 
handmade mahogany bar, mahogany tables and cabinets, stained-glass panels and a 
large beveled-glass mirror for the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Abe Dedios, Irwindale's finance director, said Leonudakis took responsibility 
for part of the cost overruns but said the city should pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dispute was eventually settled out of court, with Leonudakis 
agreeing to pay the city $300,000 over five years, it set the tone for the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
When he agreed to run Rapscallion, for example, Leonudakis also wanted to 
develop an adjacent one-acre parcel of land into an office complex to provide a 
close source of customers for the restaurant, Ekizian said. 
</P>
<P>
Bureaucratic red tape delayed the project, Ekizian claimed, and it was only 
this year that Leonudakis got the go-ahead to start development. 
</P>
<P>
"The city kind of prolonged the developing process of the parcel" to the 
detriment of the restaurant, Ekizian said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials deny delaying the project and say Leonudakis could have 
purchased the land at any point in the last three years but waited until this 
year to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ekizian said, in May the city failed to notify the restaurant when it 
began repair work on Irwindale Avenue near Rapscallion. The work went on for 
several weeks and made customers' access to the restaurant difficult and on at 
least one occasion impossible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials counter that they had no choice but to fix the road. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rapscallion does a healthy business, serving about 2,000 meals a week, 
"there have been a lot of little things that the city has been uncooperative 
on," Ekizian said, and it is this "constant harassment" that is causing 
Leonudakis to try get out of the 17 years remaining on his lease. 
</P>
<P>
"There's bad blood somewhere along the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Charles Martin, however, denied that Leonudakis' decision to sell 
was based on conflicts with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any bad taste in his mouth," he said. "As far as I'm 
concerned it's been a very pleasant relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Martin and other city officials said they are not fighting 
Leonudakis. In fact, for financial reasons, they say they would welcome the 
chance to bring in another operator. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 20-year lease Leonudakis signed in 1987, he would pay the city 
$80,000 a year for the first three years and $180,000 a year for the next 17 
years. He could also opt to buy the restaurant at any point for the same amount 
it cost the city to build, plus $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
A lease so favorable to the renter is rare in the restaurant industry, said 
Gerald Breitbart, a consultant on business issues and local government 
regulation for the Restaurant Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
A fully equipped restaurant like Rapscallion would normally rent each year for 
about 10% of its worth, or $240,000 in the case of Rapscallion, Breitbart said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledge that the lease is lopsided. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have made a better deal," said financial consultant Rudy Silva, who 
is negotiating the Rapscallion buyout for the city. "I think we can do better 
with a different operator in terms of return to the city on their investment." 
</P>
<P>
But finding another operator may be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Silva said the city will again try to get a restaurant chain like Velvet Turtle 
to open a branch on the Rapscallion site. 
</P>
<P>
David Orcutt, finance director for Velvet Turtle Restaurants, said Irwindale 
does not appear to be a likely spot for one of the upscale chain restaurants 
because of its small population and median income of less than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like a likely place for anyone to come into right now," Orcutt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials insist that an elegant restaurant can be profitable in 
Irwindale if properly managed. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Leonudakis reports more than $2 million in gross sales annually but 
claims to have lost $250,000 each year the restaurant has been open. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's not right," said Councilman Sal Hernandez, who speculated that 
Leonudakis cannot run the restaurant effectively from another state. 
</P>
<P>
Ekizian said he is unfamiliar with specifics of the restaurant's finances but 
maintains that it is well run and does a healthy business. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez opposes the buyout and says the city is letting itself be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see us bailing them out," Hernandez said. "We took a loss from the 
beginning, and we're taking another loss now (in the buyout). . . . Let him go 
under." 
</P>
<P>
Others think the buyout will in the long run make money for the city. By buying 
the lease and then renting the restaurant to another operator at a higher rate, 
the city will profit, Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking at it as we're doing a favor for Leonudakis," Silva said. "I'm 
looking at it as a good deal for us."

POMONA BRACES FOR NEW ROUND OF LAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
WORK FORCE: THE MERGER OF GENERAL DYNAMICS PLANTS IN POMONA AND RANCHO 
CUCAMONGA MEANS 1,500 TO 2,000 MORE WORKERS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
General Dynamics workers and local businesses last week braced for an uncertain 
future after the announcement of widespread layoffs at plants in Pomona and 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
"You take this to heart," said Kit Ramos, a single mother who has worked for 
General Dynamics for five years. Though she hasn't lost her job, she worries 
about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Her 17-year-old daughter, Jaymes, and 20-year-old son, Neale, have taken jobs 
at a flower shop and a discount store to bolster the family's financial 
security. Jaymes said that, while her mother worries about her job, she worries 
about her mother. "It's like she's stressed," Jaymes said. 
</P>
<P>
The stress comes in the wake of General Dynamics' announcement last week that 
it would merge the Pomona division and its Valley Systems branch in Rancho 
Cucamonga, laying off 1,500 to 2,000 employees by the end of next year. Earlier 
layoffs, beginning in October, 1987, have already cut employment at the Pomona 
plant to 4,100. The Valley Systems plant employs 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation, blamed on Pentagon cutbacks, started at the top with the 
naming of Michael C. Keel, who had been general manager of Valley Systems, as 
head of the combined unit, called the Air Defense Systems Division. Sterling 
Starr, who had run the Pomona division, will be reassigned after assisting in 
the transition. 
</P>
<P>
The streamlining will leave the company with excess production capacity at its 
Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga plants. Company officials said no decision has been 
made on whether to relocate some production lines. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the announced layoffs, General Dynamics probably will remain the 
largest employer in Pomona, ranking ahead of the Pomona Unified School District 
with 2,680 employees, Cal Poly Pomona with 2,500, Pomona Valley Hospital 
Medical Center with 2,249 and General Telephone with 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
H. S. (Biff) Byrum, executive vice president of the Pomona Economic Development 
Corp., said the layoffs are bad news but will not drastically damage the local 
economy. "It's a different situation for us than if we were some isolated town 
in the Midwest," he said. Pomona is part of a region with a broad-based 
economy, he noted, and as employment shrinks in one sector, it grows in 
another. Besides, Byrum said, "pitifully few" General Dynamics employees live 
in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Of those who work at the Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga plants, 640 live in 
Pomona, according to company figures. More live in three other cities. Rancho 
Cucamonga is home to 1,097 General Dynamics employees, Ontario has 723, and 
Upland 665. Claremont, with 216 residents employed by General Dynamics, ranks 
ninth, behind Fontana, Chino, Riverside and Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
Steve PonTel, president of the Inland Empire Economic Council, a nonprofit 
organization that promotes economic growth in Pomona Valley and San Bernardino 
and Riverside counties, said the region's economy has been so healthy for the 
past few years that workers laid off by General Dynamics were easily absorbed 
elsewhere. The problem now, he said, is that the prospective loss of 2,000 jobs 
at General Dynamics coincides with the anticipated loss of 12,000 jobs from 
closures at Norton and George Air Force bases in neighboring San Bernardino 
County and with a national economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the construction industry, which is the region's most important 
source of jobs, is facing some uncertainty over interest rates. The area's 
housing market is already soft, PonTel said, with prices of new homes under 
$200,000 leveling off, and builders of more expensive homes having difficulty 
making sales and resorting to extra financial incentives to close deals. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Jones, president of the Pomona Valley Board of Realtors, said the number 
of houses sold in the Pomona area in June fell by 18% from a year ago, but 
there are all sorts of factors at work. Plant layoffs, he said, "have an 
effect, but it's very difficult to measure." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Radlovic, senior marketing consultant with Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial 
Real Estate Services in the City of Industry, said a recent surge in 
construction of small industrial buildings in Pomona could offset some of the 
General Dynamics layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He said industrial developers are being attracted by Pomona's low land costs, 
cheaper by half than comparable land in the City of Industry or West Covina, 
and by convenient freeway access and a pro-development attitude that contrasts 
with slow-growth movements elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hampel, who runs Berliner Kindl, a German restaurant across the street 
from the General Dynamics plant in Pomona, said it stands to reason that 
layoffs are going to hurt him but "our business has not gone down at all." Thus 
far, he said, other customers have come along to replace those who were laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Margo, said she rarely hears customers from General Dynamics talk 
about layoffs at lunch because "they want to get away from that. They come in 
here to relax." But, she added, "every once in a while someone will say, 'Well, 
I got my pink slip today.' " 
</P>
<P>
Margo Hampel said the restaurant, a small, dimly lit place decorated with 
pictures of German cities and countryside, with beer steins on the wall and 
with folk music playing on a stereo, attracts "secretaries and bosses." 
</P>
<P>
Afew doors away is a restaurant and bar catering to blue-collar workers. A 
woman who said she had been working there for 25 years said she talks with a 
lot of worried workers from General Dynamics. They "don't know if they're going 
to be next out the door or what," said the woman, declining to give her name. 
"It's rumors, rumors, rumors. Nobody knows what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,400 workers are covered by union contracts requiring that layoffs be 
made largely on the basis of seniority. Layoff decisions in other cases may 
hinge on job performance and skills as well as seniority. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are laid off receive 60 days notice and job placement assistance, 
said Ole Olsen, chief of human resources at the Pomona plant. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen said laid-off workers are given help in preparing resumes, counseling on 
how to search for a job and access to job listings, word processors and copy 
machines. Since the most recent layoff announcements, Olsen said, he has been 
receiving calls from employers "all over the place" with job openings for 
positions ranging from janitor to senior engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Some laid-off workers can find jobs through the Aerospace Human Resources 
Network, which was established to retain skilled aerospace workers in the 
industry. "Aerospace is still alive; it's just not as healthy as it was," Olsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But many aerospace workers will have to start over in new industries at 
lower-paying jobs or obtain training for other work, Olsen said. Some laid-off 
workers are being referred to the federally funded Employment Training Agency 
in Ontario, which arranges for training for a variety of jobs, including 
computer drafting, appliance repair, construction work, word processing and 
graphic design. 
</P>
<P>
Although their colleagues were worried, some employees remained philosophical 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the defense budget shrinking," said M. F. Robichaud, a systems 
engineer at the Pomona plant. "(Layoffs) are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Reid, another systems engineer, also seemed undisturbed. "I'll have a job 
someplace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has General Dynamics been hurt by reduced military spending, but the 
Pentagon has changed some procedures, resulting in a loss of business for the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to cut costs by promoting competition, the Pentagon has sought a 
second source of production for all of the weapons systems produced at the 
Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga plants. For example, General Dynamics no longer 
produces all the Army's Stinger missiles and instead has to compete with 
Raytheon for the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona division makes the Sparrow air-to-air missile; the Standard missile 
for use in air defense of ships, and the Phalanx close-in weapons system to 
protect ships against missile attack. Valley Systems makes the Stinger missile 
for use by soldiers and the Rolling Airframe missile for ships. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona plant was established in 1952 to construct surface-to-air missiles 
for the Navy. Eric Solander, a company spokesman, said the Pomona site, a 
former walnut grove, was chosen in part because it was more than 40 miles from 
the coastline and would be out of the attack range of enemy submarines. The 
Navy bought the land for the production facility and owns most of the buildings 
on the 175-acre site.

The in-laws are here. Solid, Midwest types. Told them our private jet was in 
the shop. Told them the estate in Bel-Air was being fumigated for Medflies, 
hence the reason for the more modest lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
Just a humble pied-a-terre, we said. They said they never heard of anyone 
owning a pied-a-terre in a place like Azusa. Funny people. Midwest types. Told 
them they couldn't meet with our best friend, a certain Mr. Steven Spielberg, 
'cause Stevey-o was up in Aspen skiing. In-laws wanted to know how he could ski 
in the Rockies in the summertime. Brings his own snow, we told them. Those 
Midwest types, they don't miss a trick. Then we announced plans to take them to 
Venice. Oooooo, they said: The Grand Canal. St. Mark's Square. The Bridge of 
Sighs. The Doges' Palace. Before they got carried away, we reminded them that 
the jet, after all, was in the shop. However, we said the seventh annual Venice 
Arts and Crafts celebration is a mere freeway's ride away. The festival (see 
listings under Events), will feature food, a children's court with games and 
rides, more than 150 arts and crafts booths and live music throughout the day. 
And knowing that they were animal lovers, we told the in-laws that Friends of 
Animals will be offering homeless dogs and kittens for adoption. In-laws wanted 
to know if we would ride there in the Jaguar. No can do, we said, as we 
squeezed everyone into the Yugo. The Jaguar, alas, was in the shop. R.De Vita

The works on display this month at Claremont's First Street Gallery Art Center 
are inventive and out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
So are the artists. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "Creativity Unlimited," is composed of works by developmentally 
disabled adults from a San Jose art studio. 
</P>
<P>
People with such disabilities often make great artists, said Catherine Perillo, 
program director of the Claremont art gallery, which is designed to develop 
artistic potential in the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is often surprised to see how talented these people are," she said. 
"The developmentally disabled population on the whole is extremely creative. 
We're tapping into that." 
</P>
<P>
At the First Street Gallery, disabled adults learn painting, drawing, printing 
and ceramics from professional art instructors. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery was opened in November with a grant from the San Gabriel/Pomona 
Regional Center, a nonprofit private corporation that contracts with the state 
to provide services to developmentally disabled persons and their families, 
Perillo said. 
</P>
<P>
The art program is an alternative to the traditional activity centers for 
developmentally disabled people that feature tutoring in academic and social 
skills or employment training, Perillo said. 
</P>
<P>
The "Creativity Unlimited" show will continue through Aug. 31. It is on display 
Monday through Friday, from 10 a.m to 5 p.m. at the First Street Gallery, 250 
W. 1st St., Suite 100, Claremont. KAREN E. KLEIN

TOO MANY SACRIFICES ON ALTAR OF HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter says the Channel Gateway project is a great mix of 
community input and developer planning. She says the community supports this 
mega-project. 
</P>
<P>
She also makes sure the Coastal Commission hears the case more than 600 miles 
from Venice rather than waiting one month and having the hearing in Marina del 
Rey. She says this is necessary to preserve low income housing in the project. 
She also says there is no contradiction between her opposition to Marina Place 
and her support of Channel Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
Her cynical pronouncements belie the fact that she has sold out every principle 
she ever claimed to believe in. Our community is being raped at her command and 
all she can say is affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
As a lifelong renter I am a true proponent of affordable housing. The Galanter 
forces use the cause of affordable housing to further their own goals, increase 
their own property values, insure their retirement in the few affordable 
housing units available after Venice is transformed, and most important, insure 
that the Galanter re-election coffers are always full.

PEOPLE: BOOKKEEPER HONORED FOR PROGRAM THAT HELPS ADULTS LEARN TO READ

The announcement on the radio seemed almost tragic to Rusty Kostick, a woman 
who derives great joy from novels, magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard that there were adults that couldn't read," said Kostick, a Culver 
City resident in recalling her reaction five years ago when she heard a public 
service announcement seeking volunteers to work with illiterate adults. 
"Reading is such an important part of my life that I thought it was so 
important to help teach them." 
</P>
<P>
Kostick, who said she reads everything from novels to milk cartons and cereal 
boxes, followed up on the impulse by founding the Culver City Adult Reading 
Program. Since 1985, the program, which uses about 65 volunteer tutors and the 
Laubach phonetic teaching method, has taught more than 100 adults to read. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old bookkeeper was recently honored by Laubach Literacy Action with 
its 1990 award for excellency in keeping volunteer tutors. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 80% of her tutors volunteer again for the program, which is 
sponsored by the Culver City Unified School District, Friends of the Culver 
City Library and others, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was "overwhelmed" by being one of only 15 people in the country 
honored by the Laubach group this year, she said her real satisfaction is 
seeing someone learn. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people who come into the program as students were taught that they 
couldn't learn to read, that they weren't smart enough," she said. "When we 
work with them and they find they can, they get so excited." 
</P>
<P>

The Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce and Civic Assn. has named William C. 
Boyd, a founder and former editor of San Francisco Business magazine, as its 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who has also worked with the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, will be 
given the duties of marketing Beverly Hills as a headquarters city for national 
and international corporations, chamber President Edward Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center has honored Robert A. Craig, who retired 
after 33 years with the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu resident was treasurer of the hospital's fund-raising and 
development foundation when he retired. He held several positions, including 
executive director, with the hospital during his career. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA Foundation has appointed John E. Anderson, president of Topa Equities 
Ltd., to a two-year term as president. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a Bel-Air resident who donated $15 million to the UCLA Graduate 
School of Management in 1987, has been a UCLA Foundation trustee since 1984. 
The nonprofit foundation accepts and administers private contributions to the 
university.

ANGERED BY JUDGE'S RULING ON REMAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have followed the MALDEF case against the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors with great interest. Judge Kenyon's ruling has removed all doubt in 
my mind as to what the case was really all about. 
</P>
<P>
It had nothing to do with electing a Latino to the board; it had to do with 
shifting the balance of power and creating a new liberal majority on the Board 
of Supervisors. If the true motive was the electing of a Latino, then Sara 
Flores should have been allowed to win the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's calling the supervisor's latest map a "nonsensical distortion," yet 
accepting MALDEF's map proves the point. The MALDEF map is clearly 
gerrymandered to achieve their political goals at the expense of the East San 
Gabriel Valley, which has now been split into three districts. 
</P>
<P>
This region, which currently accepts about half the county's trash, has again 
been selected as the county's dumping zone. 
</P>
<P>
My city, Diamond Bar, has been placed into Supervisor Deane Dana's coastal 
district. Our post office is a substation of the Pomona Post Office and many of 
us reside in the Pomona School District, yet we are now in separate 
supervisorial districts. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Diamond Bar have much more in common with Pomona, Claremont 
and San Dimas than we do with Manhattan Beach.

LETTER OF TRIBUTE TO DAD FROM ONE OF THE BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENT HATCH, Brent Hatch is a South Pasadena auto detailer. His parents, 
William and Linda Hatch of Temple City, have 11 other children: Brad, Barlow, 
Brian, Barry, Brandon, Brenda, Bronson, Blake, Brooke, Bruce and Brittany. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My dad is turning 50 this Tuesday. I have nothing in this world that I could 
give my dad that would have a money value on it. So I wrote this letter. 
</P>
<P>
There are 12 (children) in our family: nine boys and three girls, ages ranging 
from 30 to 5 years of age. We were raised on a farm in Hemet, and my dad worked 
his fingers to the bone for a company in Lake Skinner. He would be dead tired 
but would always find the time to play ball, and go hunting and fishing with us 
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
He would get up at 5 a.m. and milk the cow and collect all of the eggs before 
we were even awake. Then, when he got home from work he would milk the cow and 
play with us until dark. 
</P>
<P>
When times were tough, there was always a great Christmas for all of us. Now 
that I'm a father -- a son and a daughter -- I hope that I'm half the father he 
was to me. 
</P>
<P>
We always had family nights on Monday where my dad taught us morals: not to 
cheat or steal; to love our neighbor, and to respect our elders. He taught us 
by example. He treats my mom like a queen and loves her with all of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
My dad still has eight children at home to raise, and he's done a great job. I 
wish I had a million dollars to give my dad, but I don't. The only thing that I 
can give to my dad this birthday is my love for him in this letter. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up great-paying jobs, in which he would have to travel a lot, to be 
with all of us. He said that nothing in this world is more important than the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
When we get together for birthdays and such, it's so much fun to be with a 
father who always builds you up and tells you how great you are -- especially 
in this world when there is so much negative. 
</P>
<P>
Dad, I love you more than you will ever imagine.

BARRY CONVICTED ON 1 COUNT; JURY DEADLOCKS ON 12 OTHERS; 
</P>
<P>
COCAINE: WASHINGTON'S MAYOR IS ACQUITTED ON ANOTHER CHARGE, AND A MISTRIAL IS 
DECLARED ON THE MORE SERIOUS COUNTS. THE TWO MISDEMEANOR VERDICTS RETURNED WILL 
STAND.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Marion Barry was convicted Friday on one misdemeanor count of cocaine 
possession and acquitted of another by a federal court jury that declared 
itself hopelessly deadlocked on 12 other drug and perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson declared a mistrial on the 
deadlocked counts and set a Sept. 17 hearing to allow the prosecution to say if 
it wishes to retry Barry on those charges. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts returned by the jury on the two misdemeanor counts will stand. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, a three-term mayor who had predicted that no jury in Washington would 
convict him, hugged his supporters and defense team in court and smiled at 
reporters when the mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stunning end to a six-week trial that featured an FBI videotape of the 
mayor smoking crack cocaine in a sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
Barry had insisted all along that he had been singled out by vindictive federal 
prosecutors. He said the government spent millions trying to convict him, and 
the case created racial tension in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Barry guilty of charges that he possessed cocaine in November 
1989 with longtime associate Doris Crenshaw. Crenshaw testified that she 
snorted cocaine with the mayor in her hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was found innocent of charges that he possessed cocaine on Sept. 7, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was hung on the three most serious counts, felony charges of lying to 
a federal grand jury about his dealings with Charles Lewis, a convicted cocaine 
dealer who was one of the government's chief witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
It also couldn't agree on a verdict on the cocaine possession charge stemming 
from the FBI sting operation. In the FBI videotape, Barry was seen smoking 
crack cocaine with former girlfriend Rasheeda Moore at the Vista Hotel on Jan. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Barry had been charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, three 
counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine and conceal 
its use. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said repeatedly that he never used cocaine, and it wasn't until 
closing arguments that Mundy acknowledged that Barry had used the drug. Even 
so, Mundy said the government had failed to produce the specifics of its case. 
</P>
<P>
As he left the courthouse, Barry was mobbed by supporters urging him to seek 
reelection. Barry had said that he would not run for a fourth term, but there 
has been speculation in recent days that he would change his mind and run as an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
"He is relieved, obviously, and this is his 202nd day chemical free," his press 
secretary Lurma Rackley said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Jay Stephens was heckled as he defended the prosecution of the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
He said that on the single conviction, the jury had held "Mr. Barry accountable 
for his criminal conduct and he must now accept responsibility for that 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would review the case before deciding whether to seek a retrial. 
Jackson scheduled a hearing for Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had asked the jury whether it wanted to resume deliberations on the 
remaining 12 counts. After conferring in the jury room, the panel said it was 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to declare a mistrial on the remaining 12 charges," Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy responded, "I move. . . ." and Jackson nodded in assent. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine possession charge is a misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of 
one year in jail and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen witnesses testified during the trial that they had seen the mayor use 
drugs about 200 times. Mundy conceded that the mayor was an occasional cocaine 
user, but said the prosecution had relied on liars to make its case and had 
failed to prove the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's trial focused attention anew on race relations in the nation's 
capital, a city whose population is 70% black. 
</P>
<P>
Several black leaders suggested that Barry was prosecuted simply because he is 
a high-profile black politician. Among them was Nation of Islam Minister Louis 
Farrakhan, who was at first barred from attending the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Two whites sat on the 12-member jury. The jury foreman was a white man. 
</P>
<P>
Barry came to the city in 1965, a civil rights worker. Three years later, after 
the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the city erupted in its 
worst racial violence. Barry was often credited with cooling tempers in the 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Barry had lost much of his support among white voters even before his arrest in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of whites are just plain annoyed and angry and just want this guy 
to go," D.C. Councilman Jim Nathanson said before the trial began. Nathanson, 
who is white, represents a predominantly white district. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the black community felt betrayed by the mayor, who had made appearance 
after appearance preaching the evils of drugs to the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Barry admitted to a problem with alcohol and prescription 
drugs, and he entered out-of-state treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
During six weeks of testimony, a parade of prosecution witnesses alleged that 
the mayor had snorted cocaine and smoked crack, opium and marijuana 200 times 
in a seven-year span. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's lawyers asserted that the prosecution witnesses -- many of them 
admitted drug users -- were lying in an attempt to ease their own legal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict is the culmination of a criminal investigation that began in 
December, 1988, after the mayor's visits to Lewis' hotel room in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis testified that Barry used cocaine and crack repeatedly on two trips to 
the Virgin Islands. He said they also smoked crack in a Washington, D.C., hotel 
room, where he said Barry became so paranoid that he unscrewed bathroom light 
bulbs to get them checked for surveillance devices. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that they conspired to cover up their drug use when police began 
investigating a complaint that Lewis had offered crack to a hotel maid. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis began cooperating with the government a year ago, after he was convicted 
of drug charges in the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's lawyers depicted Lewis as a liar who fabricated allegations of drug use 
to shorten his time in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, the government's star witness, testified that she and Barry used drugs 
together "at least 100 times" in hotels, boats and homes around the city from 
1986 to 1989. They were lovers for two years, then simply partners in drug use, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attacked Moore's credibility and motives. 
</P>
<P>
She was nearly broke and in trouble with the police when the FBI asked her to 
cooperate in the sting operation, she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
She almost never provided the court with any dates for her alleged drug use 
with Barry, saying she wasn't good with numbers. The defense suggested she was 
making up the stories and didn't want to give dates because they might conflict 
with Barry's out-of-town trips.

GULF CRISIS: IRAQ'S HUSSEIN CALLS FOR A 'HOLY WAR' AGAINST THE WEST. SECRETARY 
OF STATE BAKER WARNS NATO ALLIES OF 'A NEW DARK AGE' IF AGGRESSION AGAINST 
KUWAIT GOES UNPUNISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's Saddam Hussein, in a fiery call to arms, summoned the Arab masses Friday 
to wage "holy war" on America and topple the "emirs of oil." Arab rulers struck 
back, after days of indecision, with a plan to send their own troops to the 
side of the Americans in the Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
The new Arab force might include soldiers from Egypt and Syria, two Middle East 
military powers. 
</P>
<P>
Arab sheiks and presidents, meeting in Cairo, also decided to honor the 
worldwide U.N. trade embargo on Iraq. But eight of 20 Arab League states 
present did not support the anti-Iraq moves. 
</P>
<P>
That dimmed the prospects for a solid economic boycott and raised the 
likelihood that the U.S. Navy, whose ships were gathering in the Red Sea and 
Persian Gulf, would mount a seaborne blockade of Iraq's outlets to the world. 
</P>
<P>
On the ninth day of the crisis, as Hussein's warlike message flashed from 
Baghdad through the Mideast, U.S. troops and planes continued to stream into 
Saudi Arabia to build up their "desert shield" against the giant Iraqi army, 
which invaded and occupied neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of those GIs, Hussein urged Arabs to "burn the soil under their feet." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, thousands demonstrated in Jordanian cities against America, 
"the Satan," and chanted "Down with Fahd!" -- the Saudi monarch who last week 
invited the U.S. ground forces into his wealthy desert kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Arab sentiment seemed torn between fear of an Arab usurper, the aggressive 
Hussein, and resentment of an outside interventionist power, the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, at NATO headquarters in Belgium on 
Friday, sought new backing from U.S. allies for the Mideast military operation. 
They offered a few more ships to support a growing U.S. Navy armada expected 
soon to throw a strict cordon around Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also reiterated serious U.S. concerns about the more than 3,500 Americans 
trapped in Kuwait and Iraq because the Hussein government is forbidding 
foreigners to enter or leave. The State Department said the United States and 
several Western allies have made joint appeals to the Iraqi government to let 
citizens of their respective countries depart. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told reporters in Brussels on Friday that the United States was "very 
disturbed" about the status of the stranded Americans. But, he said, "We are 
not calling them hostages . . . nothing has been asked or demanded for their 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
However, the stranded U.S. citizens were looking more and more like insurance 
for Hussein, a trump card in his high-stakes showdown with the United States.

"They may not be called hostages, but in reality they are. . . . It's his ace 
in the hole," said the Rev. Edwin Davis of Koran, La., whose daughter and two 
grandchildren are trapped. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis say their blitzkrieg into Kuwait was aimed at redressing grievances 
old and new. The Kuwaitis' recent overproduction of oil had deflated world 
prices and Iraq's oil revenues, they complained, and Kuwait was draining Iraqi 
strength by demanding repayment of $15 billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
They also reasserted old territorial claims over Kuwait, and six days after the 
invasion they "annexed" the small oil state. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's moves drew worldwide condemnation. The U.N. Security Council ordered a 
global economic embargo. President Bush said the Iraqi army posed a threat to 
Saudi Arabia -- and therefore to the U.S. oil supply and economy -- and ordered 
American troops to reinforce the outmanned Saudi military. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who flew off Friday for a 25-day vacation in Maine, first sent a 
report to Congress declaring, "I do not believe . . . involvement in 
hostilities is imminent" in Saudi Arabia. Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, 
protested to American reporters in Cairo that "we do not threaten anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's statement, read by a spokesman on Iraqi radio and Kuwaiti television, 
struck one belligerent note after another. 
</P>
<P>
After first asserting that the United States plans aggression against Iraq, the 
President threatened various targets in language resonant with the religious 
enmities of the medieval Crusades. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Arabs! Oh, Muslims! Oh, believers in God wherever you are! This is your 
day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend Mecca, which is captive to 
the spears of the Americans and the Zionists," Hussein proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
He called on Arabs to drive the Americans from the land of Mecca and other 
Islamic holy places, to keep U.S. warships from passing through the Suez Canal 
and into the Persian Gulf, and to overthrow the family autocracies that govern 
the oil states and have "kept away the riches from the majority." 
</P>
<P>
"Your brothers in Iraq are determined on jihad (holy war)," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of Hussein's message, easily heard in Jordan, Syria and the gulf 
states, could not be immediately judged. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department on Friday, in a reflection of concern over Arab hostility, 
warned diplomatic stations to be on guard against terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Bush dismissed Hussein's statements as "a rather frantic 
ploy" by a leader "backed into a corner." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Arab League summit in Cairo was a victory for Bush and Fahd, 
who had sought to give the military shield in Saudi Arabia a multinational 
character. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak appealed to both Arab pride and Arab fear in 
rallying support for an all-Arab force in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"The choice in front of us is clear: an Arab act that will preserve higher Arab 
interests and both Iraq and Kuwait, or a foreign intervention in which we will 
have no say or control," Mubarak said. 
</P>
<P>
The summit discussions were heated. At one point, Iraqi and Kuwaiti delegates 
reportedly shouted at one another, and the foreign minister of the deposed 
Kuwaiti government collapsed and was rushed to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in closed session, 12 of the Arab states, including Egypt, Syria and the 
smaller oil emirates, approved a seven-point plan that includes stationing a 
military force in Saudi Arabia. The eight other members, including Iraq's 
neighbor Jordan, either voted against, abstained or were absent. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials said the plan would be binding only on the 12 governments 
that voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab military deployment, whose details remained to be worked out, would 
confront Hussein with a rival coalition of both monarchies and Arab republics, 
weakening his claim to pan-Arab leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, which imports $2 billion worth of food a year, people fearing 
shortages as a result of the international economic embargo rushed to stock up 
on rice, sugar, cooking oil and other foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told NATO ministers that the situation in the Persian Gulf was "full of 
peril," and called on the 15 U.S. allies in the Western alliance "to examine 
how you might help" enforce the boycott of Iraq approved by the U.N. Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not only economic progress that is threatened," he told them. "If might 
is to make right, then the world will be plunged into a new dark age." 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, more U.S. fighter planes arrived to bolster the buildup of 
U.S. combat troops. A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said the United States was prepared to put "many divisions" in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We have contingency plans that could result in the insertion of up to 200,000 
to 250,000 ground forces before it's all done," said the source, who spoke on 
condition that further identification be withheld.

NEW BOSS AT LITTLE BIGHORN MONUMENT DRAWS FIRE FROM FANS OF CUSTER;

CUSTER BATTLEFIELD NATIONAL MONUMENT, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Battle of the Little Bighorn has resumed 114 years after Lt. Col. George 
Armstrong Custer made his last stand and Indians won their last major victory 
of the Plains wars. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Barbara Booher is under attack. 
</P>
<P>
Booher, female and Indian, is the National Park Service's superintendent at the 
most famous battlefield in the American West, the place where Custer lost to 
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, but became a legend of machismo and bravery. 
</P>
<P>
Her appointment has triggered letters of protest to Washington from Custer fans 
who claim she is unfit for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters counter that her tenure already has meant more jobs at the 
battlefield for qualified Indians, and will result in a much more balanced view 
of the controversial battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Barbara was selected for all the wrong reasons, because she is a woman 
and an Indian," said Bill Wells of Malibu, who serves on the board of both the 
nonprofit Custer Battlefield Historical and Museum Assn. and the Little Big 
Horn Associates, a group dedicated to preserving Custer's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she was qualified, and she was ill-prepared. I think she is way 
in over her head," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
But Booher's arrival is hailed as a miracle by local Indian leaders, long angry 
at what they believe is a slanted emphasis at the park toward Custer and the 
7th Cavalry at the expense of proper recognition for the Sioux and Cheyenne 
warriors who won the battle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a coming of age for a monument that has been in the dark ages," said 
Janine Pease-Windy Boy, president of nearby Little Big Horn College at Crow 
Agency, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara's a breath of fresh air. Superintendents prior to her were 
consistently more interested in military history from the Custer point of view. 
There's nothing more symbolic than an Indian and a woman to upset these 
so-called historians who are mostly white and male," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over Booher's appointment began even before she arrived here in 
June, 1989. She had never worked for the park service before she was named 
superintendent. For the last 17 years, she worked for the federal government in 
Alaska, first with the Federal Aviation Administration, then as the allotment 
coordinator with the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
But in March, 1989, as an executive management trainee assigned to Lorraine 
Mintzmyer, park service regional director in the Rocky Mountain area, she so 
impressed her mentor that Mintzmyer, the highest-ranking woman in the park 
service, offered Booher the job at the Custer monument. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognized that her (American Indian) heritage might be a plus for her in an 
area where many (American Indians) live and work, but I hired her because of 
the skills she demonstrated, not because of her heritage," Mintzmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very pleased with her work at Custer, despite the fact there have 
been a few critics," she said. "But I wouldn't have become the first woman 
superintendent if someone hadn't decided to ignore the critics and give me a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Born and reared on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah, Booher's 
father was of Cherokee descent, and her mother is northern Ute. She is a 
soft-spoken woman who suffers from glaucoma in both eyes, although she is a 
pilot and owns two airplanes back in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very proud to be selected, and I'm still proud, but I had no idea it 
would be like this, with such high visibility," said Booher, 49. "I suppose I 
was a little naive. I was told it was a tough assignment, and now I know what 
that means. This is not a job, it's a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing neutral about the Custer battlefield. People say it is an 
enigma, that there's an aura that draws people. This story is known all over 
the world. All I'd ever heard about it in school was from the Custer point of 
view, and when I came here on my own as a tourist in 1973 I thought: 'Well, 
that's all cavalry.' This is the only place where all the monuments are to the 
losers." 
</P>
<P>
In her first year, Booher has doubled the hiring of Indians at the monument and 
tangled with critics over whether the book "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" 
should be sold in the gift shop, which is run by a historical association that 
considers it slanted in favor of Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent aims to create a more historically accurate presentation 
of what really happened when about 225 cavalry soldiers died with Custer on 
June 25, 1876. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Indian activists staged angry demonstrations on horseback to protest 
the park service's museum exhibits, which they say reflect the worshipful myths 
that have grown up around the Custer story in the last century. Sixteen 
displays revolve around the cavalry, while only eight depict Indian activities. 
</P>
<P>
The battle occurred soon after gold was discovered in the Black Hills of the 
Dakotas and an influx of whites surged into lands considered sacred by the 
Indians. The invasion of settlers and miners followed on the heels of many 
broken treaties. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1876, three Army columns numbering about 2,500 soldiers were 
dispatched into the territory to drive hostile Sioux and Cheyenne bands onto 
reservations. Custer and his men were part of that force, which ultimately 
succeeded in breaking the back of Indian resistance in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to help convey the reasons for the battle and its real 
significance," Booher said. "I would like to update and expand the exhibits, 
and the park brochure is going to be revised." 
</P>
<P>
But she is quick to point out that she cannot take unilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as easy to accomplish that as people think. We have to follow the 
guidelines and policies that govern all changes in parks, and those are already 
in place. I am merely an administrator." 
</P>
<P>
A top priority is establishment of a monument to the Indians who died at the 
battlefield. Marble headstones and two tall marble markers authorized by 
Congress honor fallen white soldiers. Only a painted board notes the death of 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.), the only Indian serving in Congress and 
the proud possessor of a knife used by his great-grandfather in the Battle of 
the Little Bighorn, and Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.) are co-sponsors of 
legislation to authorize both the Indian monument and a national design 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Court, a former superintendent who believes he was forced out in 1986 
because of "philosophical differences" with the park service, lives in nearby 
Hardin, Mont., and now raises money to buy land around the battlefield. He 
believes the current Indian owners might turn the acreage into tourist 
attractions, and the nonprofit organization he founded seeks to acquire the 
property and then deed it to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Court, an avid devotee of the battlefield site, is highly critical of Booher's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been writing letters to congressmen to get things changed," Court said. 
"They (the park service) seem to have lost sight of what they should be doing 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
Booher's office, which formerly was Court's, offers a sweeping view of the 
battlefield where so much blood was spilled so long ago. But today, on a table 
beside the superintendent's desk, there is an imposing statue of an Indian on 
horseback, his arm raised, his lance ready. The bronze is titled "The Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
But there also is a framed poster quoting the legendary Chief Joseph of the Nez 
Perce tribe: "Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired; my heart is sick and sad, from 
where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever." 
</P>
<P>
Booher, the only Indian woman superintendent in the park service, has 
surrounded herself with meaningful symbols of a complex heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"All of life is a test, and I suppose this is part of that test," she said. "I 
feel like I was supposed to come here. . . . I am responsible for seeing that 
these resources are taken care of for future generations of all people. 
</P>
<P>
"And that is what I'm going to do."

BOMBING HAUNTS VILLAGES ON LAOS TRAIL

HO CHI MINH TRAIL, Laos 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just off a red clay track by the sparkling Tchepone River is the reborn hamlet 
of Ban Dong Nai, which American bombers pounded into oblivion a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the villagers smile and welcome foreign visitors, but the older ones 
still wonder what they did to deserve the terror that rained from the skies 
between 1964 and 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The United States attacked Ban Dong Nai during the war because the clay track 
was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the network of jungle paths through eastern 
Laos and Cambodia that North Vietnam used to move men and supplies into South 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Not far across the Vietnamese frontier is the former U.S. base at Khe San, 
which Gen. William C. Westmoreland called the key to stopping full-scale 
infiltration from the trail. U.S. Marines held it during a 1968 siege that cost 
the lives of about 500 Americans and 10,000 Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the main target of America's "secret war" in Laos, 
which involved 242,000 bombing sorties in 1969 alone. More than 2 million tons 
of bombs were dropped on Laos altogether, more than U.S. forces used in all of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Lahoun Maprayvong, a former guerrilla now an administrator in Tchepone town, 
recalled that first day of bombing, during a Buddhist festival in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"We were warned, but we just didn't know what to expect," he said. The 
bombardment grew steadily worse. The planes came every day for nine years, 
sometimes four or five times a day and also at night. 
</P>
<P>
Lahoun said the villagers were most afraid of the huge B-52 bombers the United 
States began using extensively in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"They flew so high you couldn't see them, so there was no warning," he said. 
"They dropped bombs in line -- Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! -- like that. If you were 
next in line, then that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Each B-52 dropped 30 tons of bombs in "boxes" half a mile wide and 2 miles 
long. They left permanent craters. 
</P>
<P>
"When they bombed like that, people ran away to the mountains to live in 
caves," Lahoun said. "Some years, we had to change places five times. When we 
came back, there was nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
Ban Dong Nai and Tchepone were gone by 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Noi, who was a young girl in the 1960s, said her father was killed in one 
attack. "I just don't understand why the Americans did what they did. You 
couldn't escape the bombs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Khamlai was in her twenties in 1968, when she and her younger brother, walking 
to a rice field, both stepped on American mines. 
</P>
<P>
She looked down at the ugly, metal-and-rubber left leg she has worn for 22 
years, and said: "Can you tell me how to make it more beautiful?" 
</P>
<P>
Her brother lost both legs. 
</P>
<P>
People along the trail recalled day after day of napalm attacks. Lahoun said 
that some of them still suffer from injuries caused by napalm and phosphorous 
bombs. Many hillsides stripped by chemical defoliants are still barren. 
</P>
<P>
After South Vietnam's unsuccessful attack on the trail in 1971, all the trees 
and bushes were burned away and the road was jammed with the wreckage of tanks, 
helicopters and guns, said Phou Wattana, a district official and former 
guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers pointed out the hulk of one American-made tank and chopped away the 
long grass to uncover an artillery piece. Children played near piles of rusty 
shells and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're only dangerous if you put them in the fire," a policeman said with a 
shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Xoun, an old man who stays home from the rice paddies to tend the children of 
Ban Dong Nai, used a machete to uncover unexploded 250-pound and 500-pound 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Many bomb craters remain in and around the village, and Xoun said that 
thousands of small, unexploded antipersonnel bombs remain to kill and maim 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"When the planes came, we had to go and live in the forest for many years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see, we are used to living peacefully around here. There used to be 
lots of fruit trees -- jackfruit, coconut, banana -- but after the Americans 
came, there was nothing left. We had to rebuild everything, but the fruit trees 
won't grow anymore."

U.S. EFFORT TO SAVE RARE RED WOLVES PAYING OFF; 
</P>
<P>
NATURE: EIGHTEEN ZOOS ARE SERVING AS LIVING AREAS FOR THE NEARLY EXTINCT 
ANIMALS. DESPITE A GOOD BREEDING YEAR, THE MORTALITY RATE WAS HIGH.

<P>
Three lanky red wolf pups with an unsteady gait and a penchant for play are 
among the latest additions to a national program aimed at saving the nearly 
extinct species. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still a little clumsy and don't have the fluid motion of their parents 
yet," said John Harglewood, director of the Good Children's Zoo at Oglebay 
Park, one of 18 zoos nationwide that serve as breeding and living areas for the 
wolves. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just like dog puppies, always wanting to play," Harglewood said. "When 
people first see them, they think they're just another attraction at the zoo 
but they really take an interest when they find out how rare they are." 
</P>
<P>
Five charcoal gray pups, one male and four females, with white markings on 
their feet and chest, were born to No. 278, a female, and No. 282 at Oglebay in 
early May. One of the females was stillborn and another died a day later from a 
bacterial infection, Harglewood said. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving pups have since taken on the rusty red hue of their parents. They 
weigh 15 to 20 pounds, eat solid food and spend much of their time outside 
their den, a customized, rock-covered septic tank. 
</P>
<P>
The number of red wolves worldwide stood at 131, 74 females and 57 males, on 
July 31, said Roland Smith, coordinator of the red wolf species survival plan 
for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good breeding year," Smith said in a telephone interview. "But our 
mortality rate was kind of high." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said 17 the 49 pups born this year died for various reasons. "We had a 
couple of litters where the female ate the young." 
</P>
<P>
Wolves give birth only in April and May and average about five pups in a 
litter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The adult wolves have been at Oglebay since December, 1988, but apparently were 
not comfortable enough in their new surroundings to breed in 1989, said Penny 
Miller, curator at the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Adult red wolves, about the size of a female German shepherd, are slightly 
smaller than their gray cousins. By the early 1970s, vanishing habitat and a 
bounty on them had driven them to virtual extinction, except for several 
isolated areas in Louisiana and Texas, where they began to mate with coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
The animals once ranged as far east as Delaware, westward across central 
Indiana and Illinois to Oklahoma and throughout the South, from western Texas 
to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Had they remained in the wild, they would be extinct," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1973 to 1980, more than 400 red wolves or coyote hybrids were examined by 
federal game officials seeking to preserve a pure strain. The fish and wildlife 
service established the red wolf recovery program in 1980, with 40 wolves 
determined to be genetically pure. 
</P>
<P>
The wolves at Oglebay and elsewhere are all descendants of that core group. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have about 350 wolves in captivity and about 200 in the wild," 
Smith said. "With that we can keep the population together without losing 
genetic diversity for the next 50 to 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight red wolves have been released at four sites, in the Carolinas, 
Mississippi and Florida, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wolves have done pretty well, actually much better than we expected," 
Smith said. "They're never going to come back to the numbers there used to be 
because of a loss of habitat. But we should have a few pockets with red wolves 
in them."

Downstairs from an austere police office, a heavily guarded storeroom contains 
enough confiscated drugs to pay for a Miami condominium. 
</P>
<P>
The office is that of Jose Nunes Goncalves Carvalho, director of the Portuguese 
Judicial Police drug squad, which is waging war on smuggling. Portugal, at the 
southwestern tip of Europe, is becoming a main point of entry for South 
American drug shipments, and authorities here are determined to wipe out the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with the United States and other concerned countries has been 
improved. Border controls are tighter and hundreds of specialized police are 
working on tip-offs from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an all-out fight," said Carvalho. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure how much contraband slips through, but he and his men are 
clearly seeing results. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, police seized 1,745 pounds of cocaine and 130 pounds of heroin -- 
more than twice what was intercepted in 1988. Arrests of consumer-traffickers 
were nearly doubled, to 2,534. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in July, police seized 460 pounds of South American cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking the drug problem very seriously," one Western diplomat said of 
the Portuguese crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the storeroom below Carvalho's office, the aroma of hashish fills the air. 
Police aide Anselmo Semedo Louro pointed to piles of captured drugs waiting to 
be burned. "This is just the tip of the iceberg," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks of leaves and white powder are stacked next to false-bottomed suitcases 
and plastic bags of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Drug authorities say that overproduction in South America and falling prices in 
the United States have forced smugglers into new markets, particularly in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Its sea and air links across the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea make 
Portugal a convenient transit point to cities such as Frankfurt, Milan or 
Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine often comes into Lisbon on direct flights from Brazil or from 
Venezuela, which has a large Portuguese community. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger quantities frequently come in containers on cargo shipments. Some drugs 
are carried in small boats, which use Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores islands as 
a stopping point, Western diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
Not all that comes in goes out, however. More and more cocaine is being 
consumed in Portugal, and rising local demand for Asian heroin is alarming 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of Portugal's addict population range from 5,000 to 100,000 -- of 10 
million total -- but everyone agrees that the numbers are going up. 
</P>
<P>
With Latin American economies in tatters and the Portuguese among the poorest 
people in Western Europe, there is no shortage of people willing to risk 
drug-trafficking to earn money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, they said, a courier can earn $2,000 (about half the annual per 
capita income in Portugal) and a get a free plane ride for making just one 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have stepped up surveillance at airports, ports and frontiers, and 
now require visitors from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to carry visas. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal is also working closely with U.S. agents and the international police 
organization, Interpol, and has signed accords with West Germany, Morocco, 
Britain and Spain. Other deals, including one with Brazil, are in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been cases where the Portuguese authorities have helped enormously, 
and it has been made known to the British authorities that drugs were being 
taken to Britain," British Home Secretary David Waddington said recently in 
Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the cooperation between our two countries, important finds of 
drugs and arrests have taken place." 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat also acknowledged Portugal's efforts, but said that 
further work could be done. Law enforcement, in particular, he said, was 
hindered by the involvement of many agencies that did not always coordinate 
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Catching the stuff at the port of entry is very hit-and-miss," the diplomat 
said.

IN AFRICA, DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT SLOWLY REPLACING PERSONALITY CULTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a new member of the parliament called President Robert Mugabe "the only 
other Son of God," Mugabe joined a galaxy of African leaders who have been 
showered with fanciful honorifics. 
</P>
<P>
Mugabe already had been dubbed "the most authentic, consistent and 
revolutionary leader" in the ruling ZANU PF Party's newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
His Kenyan counterpart, Daniel Arap Moi, is known as "The Glorious" (Mheshimiwa 
in Swahili). The octogenarian Hastings Kamuzu Banda is "The Lion of Malawi" or 
"Savior" (Mkango waMalawi or Ngwazi in the native Nyanja.) 
</P>
<P>
Praise-singing, once an important feature of the reverence accorded to African 
rulers, is being challenged more and more by a critical public demanding 
political freedom. 
</P>
<P>
For placing Mugabe on a par with Jesus Christ, Tony Gara was accused of 
professional sycophancy and blasphemy. Angry letters to the local press 
denounced him for saying that "(Zimbabwe) and its people should thank the 
Almighty for giving us his only other Son -- by the name of Robert Gabriel 
Mugabe." 
</P>
<P>
The local Catholic magazine Moto protested that Zimbabwe did not need a 
personality cult such as that supporting North Korea's President Kim Il Sung, 
who is known as the Great Leader. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jonathan Moyo, a University of Zimbabwe political science lecturer 
and outspoken critic of Mugabe, the bestowing of accolades on leaders is a 
precolonial African tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional chiefs in precolonial societies enjoyed these praises as they 
sought to build centralized structures of authority and coercion. Some of the 
leaders who inherited power at independence have continued to rule like 
chiefs," Moyo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because most African countries are colonially created states, hero worshiping 
. . . has always been justified on grounds of consolidating nationhood. That is 
where you get that concept of one country, one leader." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the attributes heaped on African leaders by their subjects compare 
their powers to those of God or of a dangerous animal. 
</P>
<P>
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire rules under the self-proclaimed title "The 
one who is and shall always be," derived from a name he gave himself in the 
1960s, Kuku Ngbengu Wasa Banga. 
</P>
<P>
"God the Almighty is an attractive comparison, because he expects absolute 
loyalty and obedience," Moyo said. 
</P>
<P>
Banda has suppressed all opposition since he came to power in 1964. Officials 
insist that he be addressed as "Ngwazi, His Excellency the Life President, 
Mkango waMalawi, Dr. Kamuzu Banda." 
</P>
<P>
When Banda is seated, his chief of protocol kneels to address him. Malawians 
must invoke Kamuzu's name in all official statements. 
</P>
<P>
On a trip to Malawi early this year, Banda gave Mugabe a leopard skin, a symbol 
of power in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
No recent African leader has followed the example of the Central African 
Republic's Jean-Bedel Bokassa, who declared himself emperor in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Moyo said the habit of hero worshipping is fading: "The ordinary man is now 
aware that once he treats his political leader like a traditional chief, the 
leader wants to hold onto power till death." 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the titles that have lost their appeal. African symbols of power 
worn by some leaders, mostly postcolonial nationalists of the 1950s and 1960s, 
are also under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's trademark is a leopard-skin hat. Banda carries a fly whisk; Moi sports 
a short staff. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia is never without a white 
handkerchief in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Moi's predecessor and Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, also carried a 
fly whisk. 
</P>
<P>
Some younger African leaders have managed without the titles and symbols, among 
them Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano 
and presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
"Public respect for praise names and power symbols is declining as fast as the 
pressure for democracy on the continent is building," said Chengatai Malumo of 
the University of Zimbabwe.

IRELAND'S JEWS FACE SHRINKING POPULATION 
</P>

DUBLIN, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Jews seeking a better life settled in Ireland over the centuries, and 
many rose to prominence in an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic society. 
</P>
<P>
Now the hardships that have made generations of Irish leave their ruggedly 
beautiful land also are affecting young Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Some seek greater opportunity in Britain and the United States. Others go to 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Jews in the Irish Republic and British-ruled Northern Ireland has 
declined by more than half from a population of 5,400 at the end of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
"I envisaged this happening," said Raphael Siev, curator of the Irish Jewish 
Museum in Dublin. "We must save some of the records, the material, and describe 
the lives of Jewish people in Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
He said about two dozen Jews leave each year, and the number remaining could 
fall to a few hundred in a matter of decades. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old museum's collection includes the wedding picture of Esther 
Steinberg, the only known Irish victim of the Holocaust. There is an 
autographed photo of Chaim Herzog, president of Israel, who was born in Belfast 
and grew up in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
Siev, 55, has included some of his own family memorabilia, along with 
information about Irish-Jewish authors and other prominent personalities. A 
restored synagogue is part of the museum in an area once called Little 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal arrived in Ireland in the 15th Century. 
Others came from Poland and Lithuania as anti-Semitism increased near the end 
of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how Jews bound from Lithuania to America wound up in Ireland, Siev's 
eyes twinkled. 
</P>
<P>
His story: When the ships stopped in such Irish ports as Limerick and Cork 
before the difficult Atlantic crossing, Lithuanian Jews asked the captains 
where they were. 
</P>
<P>
"Ireland" sounds like Yiddish for "your country," which convinced some 
passengers they had reached the New World. 
</P>
<P>
"So a few of them, of course, hopped off, saying, 'Well, this is fine,' " Siev 
said in the brogue of the land. 
</P>
<P>
He and many other Irish Jews trace their roots to Lithuania, although some 
ancestors reached the Emerald Isle by way of England. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Briscoe was Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1956 and 1961. His son Ben, a member 
of Parliament for 25 years, held the post in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"My father's proudest boast always was that the fact he was Jewish had nothing 
to do with him becoming Lord Mayor of Dublin; if you deserved an honor in 
Ireland, you got it," Ben Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a pogrom in Limerick in 1904, Ireland has been notably 
tolerant of its Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholics make up 94% of the 3.5 million people, however, and occasional 
tensions are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders bitterly criticize Ireland's refusal to accept more than about 
two dozen Jewish immigrants in the 1930s, when European countries sought havens 
for the refugees from the increasing menace of Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland was neutral in World War II, and recently declassified documents show 
that authorities feared an influx of Jews would spur anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
Ronit Lentin, an Israeli married to an Irish Jew who is a television producer, 
says she feels an "undercurrent of anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
"My husband can still be told by people, 'But you're not really Irish,' " she 
said. "Now, how Irish is Irish? He was born in Ireland, and his father was born 
in Ireland. When do you become Irish? When you become Catholic, this is the 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
Lentin, a 45-year-old journalist, said she would not be surprised if her 
teen-age children eventually left Ireland.

TROTSKYITES LAUD END OF 'STALIN'S SYSTEM'; 
</P>
<P>
IDEOLOGY: DEVOTEES OF THE EXILED AND SLAIN REVOLUTIONARY WELCOME UPHEAVAL IN 
THE SOVIET UNION. AT LAST, THEY SAY, TRUE COMMUNISM MAY HAVE ITS DAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
As Josef Stalin's collective system crumbles across Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union, descendants and followers of the former dictator's archrival, 
Leon Trotsky, say the road to true communism has just been opened. 
</P>
<P>
His grandson, Esteven Volkov, is one of the few descendants to survive Soviet 
death camps or exile. He looks happily on the crash of the empire founded by 
Stalin, but refuses to applaud Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
market-based perestroika or to write off communism as a lost cause. Far from 
it, he says, Trotsky's ideas for a worldwide communist system may yet change 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Communism has hardly existed -- only Stalinism -- so how can they say it is 
dead?" the taciturn, 64-year-old Volkov said in an interview beside his 
grandfather's grave near the house in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
For the 50th anniversary of Trotsky's death, the fortress-like house where the 
founder of the Red Army lived and died on a quiet, tree-lined street is being 
spruced up at government expense, with repairs and fresh paint and a display of 
family photos. 
</P>
<P>
Bullet holes left in Trotsky's bedroom wall from an attempt on his life will 
not be filled in. Trotsky and his wife, Natalie, hid under their bed and 
survived that attack, led by Mexico's famous pro-Stalin muralist, David Alfredo 
Siqueiros. On Aug. 20, 1940, Trotsky was struck down by an ice pick-wielding 
assassin many believed was a Stalinist agent. 
</P>
<P>
Turrets with rifle ports still stand at each corner of the walls that surround 
the house, which Volkov said he remembers were once manned by nervous young 
Trotskyites little used to toting weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery writer moved into the house after a two-year stay with Mexico's 
left-wing muralist Diego Rivera, where it is widely remarked that he had a 
clandestine love affair with Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, also an artist. 
</P>
<P>
His last house -- and his and Natalie's tomb, proudly engraved with the hammer 
and sickle -- have become something of a Mecca to the communist faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the long-running attraction for Western visitors, the signatures of 
Russians and East Europeans are newly scribbled in the registry inside the 
house. The former Soviet ambassador to Mexico recently paid a visit, Volkov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The demise of Stalinism is a fact that, despite all the confusions, is very 
positive. Now we only have capitalist imperialists, not our fellow communists, 
to fight against," said Manuel Aguilar, leader of Mexico's Trotsky-influenced 
Revolutionary Workers Party. 
</P>
<P>
Trotsky, whom Vladimir I. Lenin favored to succeed him as Soviet leader, spent 
most of his life fighting for a worker-peasant brand of communism that would 
span the world without the monolithic, one-party rule favored by Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
After Lenin died in 1923, Stalin took over the leadership and waged a hate 
campaign against Trotsky before driving him into exile in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Trotsky was hounded across Europe and Turkey, until Mexico's renowned leftist 
president, Lazaro Cardenas, offered him exile in 1937. The bearded 
revolutionary, little expecting a hero's welcome, was met by a special train 
for the trip to Mexico City from Tampico, where he came ashore. 
</P>
<P>
A picture on his bedroom wall shows crowds of Mexicans mourning Trotsky in the 
main square of the capital after he was killed. The 26-year-old assassin, Ramon 
Mercader, a Spaniard, spent 20 years in jail in Mexico and then lived in the 
Soviet Union and other communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes on, the tragic figure of the 'unarmed and exiled prophet' 
(Trotsky) is bound to grow, while that of his executioner, Josef Stalin, is . . 
. repudiated," an article in the Mexican government's El Nacional daily said in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Volkov said that the Mexican government is planning to open a center this year 
next to the Trotsky house, dedicated to the revolutionary and devoted to the 
study of political exile.

<P>
Peter Orsino's eyes flash with anger when anyone tells him the death of his 
8-year-old son was an act of God. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Orsino Jr. was eating in the cafeteria of the East Coldenham Elementary 
School last Nov. 16 when a 90-m.p.h. wind demolished a 12-foot cafeteria wall, 
later shown to be of defective design. Peter and eight other children died in a 
shower of concrete and glass. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't an act of God," the boy's father said, "because God doesn't make 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Orsino and several other bereaved parents have channeled their grief and anger 
into a tenacious effort to get the state to change laws regarding inspections 
of school buildings. But a top school official said these efforts, and lawsuits 
filed in the wake of the disaster, have caused bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months after the storm clouds lifted, this close-knit rural hamlet 50 
miles north of New York City is divided between those who want to forget the 
tragedy and those who can't. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures from that day remain etched in memory: tearful parents rushing up to 
the school to see if their children were alive or dead. 
</P>
<P>
Sympathy poured in from across the country, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo attended a 
memorial service for the nine dead children three days after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
When the initial shock wore off, parents from seven of the nine families 
started to meet regularly at the town firehouse. It was a way to talk through 
their grief, said John Lichtler, whose 7-year-old daughter, Joanna, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
That grief turned to anger when a state report on the disaster concluded that 
the cafeteria wall, built with the rest of the school in 1959, was not capable 
of withstanding hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
"Accidents happen every day, people are hurt and killed," said Frances Soltis, 
who lost her 7-year-old son, Adam. "But our children were not out in the street 
running in front of cars and they weren't playing with matches. They were 
eating their lunch in a school cafeteria. They were in a place where they were 
supposed to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
In March, the parents of seven East Coldenham victims signed a letter to Cuomo, 
urging legislative action on school-building safety. 
</P>
<P>
The parents want architects and engineers sent to every school in the state at 
regular intervals to detect possible dangers. They want blueprints checked to 
see if others have design flaws similar to East Coldenham's. Defects were 
discovered at four other New York schools after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The parents' anger, their continued outspokenness, has not been well received 
by some of their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Armbrister, who lost his 7-year-old stepson, said he had to restrain 
himself from attacking one man who told him, "What are you fighting for? You're 
going to be a millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Armbrister and 32 others -- parents of the 24 children who were injured or 
killed, along with others who say their children were traumatized -- have filed 
negligence lawsuits against the state, Orange County and the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits have caused resentment among unaffected parents who wonder what 
the claims could do to tax bills, said James Coonan, superintendent of the 
Valley Central School District. 
</P>
<P>
School officials are stuck between two emotional camps, Coonan said. 
</P>
<P>
An incident about three weeks after the disaster typified some of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
While driving one of her three surviving children to East Coldenham to school, 
Soltis saw the building's American flag flying at full-staff for the first time 
since the storm. It was like a "dagger through my heart," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She lowered the flag to half-staff in the late autumn chill. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, she found the flag at full-staff again. Again, she lowered it. 
</P>
<P>
"They reach a point where they don't want to confront it anymore," Soltis said. 
"I see it in the (other) families. They got through with minimal damage to 
their family. They survived, so there's a tendency to block it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect people to feel what I feel," she said. "But I expect them to 
respect my son's memory and to respect my family's grief." 
</P>
<P>
Coonan said no disrespect was intended to storm victims. School officials 
agreed to keep the flag flying at half-staff for the rest of the school year -- 
drawing phone calls from other parents who complained that it was an unpleasant 
reminder for their children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The flag will be flying at full-staff again when school opens in September. 
</P>

"You get trouble when you go from sad to mad," Coonan said. "There's a lot of 
anger when people lose children, and that anger is kind of out there looking 
for someplace to land, and it lands on different people at different times. 
It's not always pleasant when it happens, but people tell us it's normal."

Lichtler leads the effort to change state school inspection laws. A computer 
programmer at the U.S. Military Academy, he has compiled a bulging file of 
newspaper stories about shoddy school construction. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Education Committee in the New York state Assembly, Angelo 
Del Toro, is backing the parents with a bill that would require schools to be 
inspected once every three years. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers did not act on the proposal before recessing for the summer earlier 
this year, partly because of a last-minute proposal from Cuomo. The governor, 
concerned about the cost of mandatory inspections, suggested training local 
school officials to make the inspections themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Valley Central schools all have been inspected, some school 
districts are concerned about the expense of hiring experts for regular 
inspections, said Richard Jansen, until recently the school board president. 
</P>
<P>
"Our children should be safe, but there has to be a real rational way of doing 
it," Jansen said. "I could see some problems down the road when the expenses 
would just get bigger and bigger." 
</P>
<P>
To the bereaved, no price is too high. 
</P>
<P>
Soltis said her three children will go to private school this fall, and 
Armbrister said he isn't sure if East Coldenham is safe enough for him to send 
his daughter to kindergarten there next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to feel that our children's lives amounted to something," Lichtler 
said. "If we can save one child, then their lives would have been at least been 
. . . for a purpose."

GLOBAL WARMING GIVES WINDMILLS A LIFT 
</P>

<P>
Windmills are springing up again all over the Dutch countryside -- not the 
picturesque wooden machines of 600 years of tradition but sleek metal devices. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is embarking on its biggest windmill building program since 
steam power and the internal combustion engine made wind power obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Windmills are suddenly popular as a means of cutting pollution and curbing 
global warming by generating electricity without burning fossil fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The original windmills helped create much of the Netherlands by draining land 
in a reclamation program that got under way in earnest in the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of their modern-day counterparts is likely to be more modest. Even 
in the wind-swept Netherlands, windmills will only supplement other energy 
sources, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But spurred on by a 40% government subsidy on installation costs, wind turbine 
capacity is expected to more than double this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of new wind farms being built at the moment because of the 
subsidy program," said Ad van Wijk of Utrecht University. 
</P>
<P>
He expects the country's wind power generation to rise from 40 megawatts at the 
end of 1989 to 90 megawatts by early 1991 and 400 megawatts by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of 1,000 megawatts by the end of the century 
but the unreliability of wind means this will replace only 200 megawatts of 
conventional capacity, according to the electricity companies' organization, 
SEP. 
</P>
<P>
Current power station capacity is 15,000 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
But, with oil prices recently around their lowest level since 1973, wind power 
looks expensive. It costs 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour, against four cents for 
conventional power. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of wind power, however, argue that the price gap is much less once 
environmental costs are taken into account and that technical improvements are 
bringing costs down all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that by 1995 we will be producing at 6.5 cents per kilowatt 
hour . . . and then wind power will be cost effective," Van Wijk said. 
</P>
<P>
He calculates that electricity from conventional power stations would cost an 
extra 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour if carbon dioxide emissions were cut by 95%. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide and other so-called "greenhouse" gases are thought to trap heat 
in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands intends to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions over the next 
four years and an inquiry is being started this year into the use of regulatory 
energy levies to penalize carbon dioxide production. 
</P>
<P>
"Global warming is a new item on the agenda," said Leslie de Zilwa, president 
of the largest Dutch wind power producer, Ijsselmij Energy Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We are discovering that it is not only the capital costs and the fuel costs 
that count but also the social costs -- that is, the cost of removing carbon 
dioxide and other gases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
De Zilwa's firm is about to build another 25 turbines, each 100 feet high, at 
its wind farm at Urk in the north of the country, doubling capacity to 15 
megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
However, windmill operators are finding the environmental factor is not going 
all their way. Wind power may be clean but many people think lines of turbines 
stretching across the countryside are unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
One way around the problem could be to build fewer but bigger windmills, 
producing more power per square foot and cluttering up the countryside less, de 
Zilwa believes. 
</P>
<P>
The 400 or so wind turbines operating now generate an average of only 100 
kilowatts each while those being installed this year range from 250 to 500 
kilowatts. But elsewhere in Europe producers are experimenting with single 
turbines generating 1,000 kilowatts or more. One turbine in the Orkney Islands 
off Scotland has a capacity of 3,000 kilowatts.

GRANDPARENTS' RIGHTS LAWS CAN CAUSE BITTER VISITATION CONFLICTS;

<P>
Five days after the General Assembly passed a bill strengthening the rights of 
grandparents to visit their grandchildren, Joni and David Gammie and their 
three children left the state. 
</P>
<P>
The couple put their brick home in the Chicago suburb of La Grange on the 
market, left their jobs and did not tell their families where they were going. 
They wanted to keep Joni's mother from ever seeing the children again. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1989, and this year lawmakers decided that the state law went too 
far. Last month, they passed a bill that repealed what they had done the year 
before. Gov. James R. Thompson has not decided whether to sign it. He has until 
late September. 
</P>
<P>
All states have laws allowing grandparents to ask the courts for rights to 
visit grandchildren if a parent is divorced or dead. But the "grandparents' 
rights" law enacted last year in Illinois allowed grandparents to sue for 
visitation rights even if the parents of the children are married or living 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said they know of only a few lawsuits filed under the 1989 law, but 
they have been bitter. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, grandparents argue that family rifts should not keep them from 
their grandchildren. On the other side are parents who disapprove of how their 
parents treat the grandchildren and lawyers who argue that the law is an 
unconstitutional interference with parents' rights to raise their children as 
they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
The Illinois law was enacted after three years of attempts by state Rep. James 
Stange, who decided to sponsor legislation after hearing stories like that of 
Joni Gammie's mother, Ruth Etheridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these families were intact, and then, all of a sudden, there was a 
fight or disagreement, and the families were pulled apart," Stange said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Etheridge's living room, a pine tree bears three yellow ribbons, 
symbols of her hope that she will someday see her grandchildren. The Gammies 
have since had a fourth child, a son, but Etheridge said she never was told of 
the April birth. 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge and her daughter have accused each other of abusing the 
grandchildren. Each side says there is no evidence for the other's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Etheridge, an addictions counselor, saw her grandchildren was in 
January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Her problems led her to found Grandchildren's Rights to Grandparents, an 
organization that claims 200 members in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Laws in 21 states, as of 1989, do not specifically limit visitation rights to 
cases of parental divorce or death, said Jeff Atkinson, a professor of family 
law at Loyola University in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many of those laws would permit grandparents to sue 
successfully for visitation if the families are intact, because many state 
courts have not yet interpreted this area of law, Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tennessee, a judge has ordered a married couple to allow the paternal 
grandparents to see their grandchildren, based on a 1985 law. The parents moved 
with their children to Georgia, and the case is still in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Conflicts about grandparent visitation usually occur when parents are divorced 
and the non-custodial parent's mother and father are not allowed to see their 
grandchildren, said Tennessee state Rep. Brenda Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much concerned when a child gets caught in the middle of a 
disagreement between parents and grandparents, and that's what we're talking 
about here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois state Sen. William Marovitz said he supports grandparents' visitation 
rights, but he thinks Illinois went too far last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people call this the grandparents' rights law," said Marovitz, who 
sponsored the repeal measure. "Others call it the in-laws' interference law." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard Goldstein, chairman of the Illinois State Bar Assn.'s 
legislation committee, said the 1989 law is unconstitutional because parental 
authority is protected by the 14th Amendment. He argued that government may not 
interfere unless there is a compelling interest, such as abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society is predicated on parental autonomy," Goldstein said. "The parents 
are granted the authority to raise their children as they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
One mother who agrees is Karyn Brooks, who was sued for visitation rights by 
her mother, Dorothy Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Morton Grove, said she went to court 
in January, 1989, under the old grandparents' visitation law after her daughter 
refused to let her see her 7-year-old grandson, Christopher, at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said she had never barred her mother from seeing Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was divorced at the time, but she remarried her former husband and moved 
to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"If grandparents had the best interests of the grandchildren in mind, they 
wouldn't take their children to court," Brooks said. "I just think this law is 
destroying the parents. I think we could have worked it out better ourselves."

SHOW BOATS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY ATTRACT GAWKERS AND DON'T FLOAT, BUT THEIR RESIDENTS ENJOY LIVING IN THEM

ENCINITAS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Baskin was on the telephone with his father in Santa Cruz, describing his 
swell new rental home in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean you live on a boat?" his father asked. "You mean a boat 
floating in the water?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
"So you mean you live on the beach?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not exactly, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Baskin and his wife, Donna, moved into the SS Encinitas, one of two 
identical boathouses that for more than 60 years have been dry-docked in the 
middle of an otherwise ordinary suburban block near downtown Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Built by an eccentric, out-of-work marine engineer in 1929, the pair of 
nautical oddities have since become salty north San Diego County landmarks, 
captured on postcards, paintings, sketches and countless snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
Locals say the boathouses were never meant to sail, but were built on the site 
a few blocks from the beach, side by side, as landlubber quarters replete with 
two decks, a full living room, two bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths and an authentic 
galley. 
</P>
<P>
Even with their sterns moored in a concrete foundation, the boathouses have 
nonetheless provided residents with all the trappings of life at sea -- down to 
the awkwardly low ceilings and slight starboard list. 
</P>
<P>
On stormy nights, or after a few bottles of good wine, the Baskins say they can 
actually feel the boats begin a gentle rocking motion. 
</P>
<P>
"On rainy nights, you feel like you're adrift on the high seas," Mark Baskin 
said. "You can feel the boat moving just a tiny bit. You can even hear the wood 
creaking in spots. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, in severe rainstorms, I have to run out and collect the furniture 
from the outside deck. It makes me feel like I'm battening down the hatches or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
For the Baskins and three generations of previous residents, life inside the 
Encinitas boathouses has often been like living in a giant fishbowl. 
</P>
<P>
On any weekend, dozens of curious passers-by will stop, look and then look 
again. Some will knock on the door and ask for a private tour. And those are 
the polite ones. Others peer inside any of the 19 portholes that line the wood 
and concrete hull. 
</P>
<P>
There have been accidents, boathouse residents say -- minor fender-benders that 
occur when the car of one rubbernecker slams into the back of another. 
</P>
<P>
Once, years ago, a passing dentist tried to buy one of the boathouses for an 
office -- because he believed his younger patients would no longer be afraid to 
visit him. 
</P>
<P>
The constant intrusions have taken their toll. The tenant living in the 
adjacent SS Moonlight is so weary of the questions that he declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
But the Baskins take all the attention in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have barbecues up on the top deck or when I sunbathe on the bow, you 
won't believe the reaction we get," Donna Baskin said. "Just about everyone 
that passes who hasn't seen the boats before wants the full history. 
</P>
<P>
"And then there's the people with the video cameras and zoom lenses. At first, 
I was snappy about it and kind of irritable. But then I remembered -- that's 
how we were the first time we saw the boathouses." 
</P>
<P>
When he lived down the street from the boathouses in the 1970s, Mark Baskin 
recalls "snooping around," taking a few curious peeks through the portholes 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year, he spotted the owner placing a "For Rent" sign outside. "I saw 
my chance to finally walk around inside one of the boathouses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really impressed with how spacious it was inside. I told the owner that 
day that we wanted the place. I just had to run home and get my deposit." 
</P>
<P>
For 43 years, Marie Baxley has lived across the street from the boathouses in 
an old stucco home. Sometimes, she says, the gawkers and their incessant 
questions drive her practically insane. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a nickel for every snapshot taken of those places, I'd be a rich 
woman today," she said. "I can't get any gardening done without the questions 
starting. 'Do I know who lives there?' 'What do they look like inside?' 'Are 
they really boats that were moved here from the water?' 
</P>
<P>
"Just once I'd like to tell someone that a high tide picked those boats up from 
the ocean and brought them right here." 
</P>
<P>
The boathouses are a jarring sight on the palm-studded suburban street, their 
pointy bows jutting toward the street, their front lawns lined with heavy ropes 
and wooden pilings to give them a truly nautical flair. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Mel Burstein. As the tourist from Miami maneuvered his big rental car 
to the side of the street, his wife was ready with the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a double take, drove two blocks and decided to come back and take a 
picture," Betty Burstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything like this in Miami," her husband said. "Only in 
California. I guess when the floods come, they'll be ready. Who lives there 
anyway -- Noah?" 
</P>
<P>
Tom Voss, another curious passer-by, said he was surprised that the boats have 
survived in an era of strict city building codes. "They must have been put here 
a long time before people cared about such things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Miles M. Kellog built the boathouses just before the onset of the 
Depression, there weren't many building codes to guide him -- nor other houses, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Locals say Kellog built several houses in what is now the 700 block of 3rd 
Street before he constructed the first boathouse out of wood scraps from a 
recently demolished dance hall on nearby Moonlight Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the SS Encinitas looked awkward on the site. So he added a companion boat 
-- the SS Moonlight -- right next door. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the boathouses have passed through the hands of several owners -- 
most of whom have rented them out to an assortment of tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Some owners have taken good care of the structures. Others allowed them to 
lapse into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother always said she wished those boathouses would just burn down," 
recalled Betty Jo Swaim, a longtime Encinitas resident. "She said they just 
stuck out like sore thumbs. And that they always attracted the wrong kind." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Engledow, who with her husband, Clint, has owned the structures for more 
than 20 years, said the boathouses have been featured on postcards, in national 
magazines -- even on the sketch boards of local artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody tells me they're tacky," said the 72-year-old Leucadia resident. "Over 
the years, they've become a curiosity around Encinitas. He built them like real 
boats with curved walls and real touches of workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"People around here are impressed when they say, 'You own the boathouses?' 
They're a historic monument, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
By now, though, Donna and Mark Baskin can recite the drawbacks of living the 
ocean life on dry land. 
</P>
<P>
They have to remember to duck their heads while scaling the stairway, and some 
furniture must be propped up on one side because of uneven floors caused by the 
structure's pronounced list. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's all worth it for that one night when they can admire the nearby 
city lights from the bow-front porch, as though they were relaxing on a cruise 
ship with the engines off in perfectly calm seas. 
</P>
<P>
"The place has lots of charm," said Donna Baskin, a restaurant manager. 
"Sometimes, when I come home from work in a bad mood, all I have to do is take 
one look at this place and I feel better. It's like, 'Hey, I actually live 
there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Images of life inside one of the boathouses can last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Betty Jo Swaim once played with friends who lived in the SS 
Encinitas, spilling hot chocolate all over their embroidered tablecloth as they 
pretended to be lost at sea in a ferocious storm. 
</P>
<P>
More than half a century later, she can't drive by the boathouses without 
thinking of those days. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I make a conscious effort to look at those old boathouses when I 
drive by," she said. "They just remind me of how much fun I had when I was a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"And while everything else is changing, they're the one thing around here 
that's stayed the same."

STILL CRUISING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: ON SUNDAY NIGHTS, SAVIERS ROAD BECOMES THE PLACE TO SEE AND BE SEEN IN 
CARS AND MINI-TRUCKS. AND THE ACTIVITIES ARE NEARLY TROUBLE-FREE.

It is a scene played out every Sunday night on a mile-long strip of Saviers 
Road in Oxnard: 
</P>
<P>
Bumper to bumper, convertibles with shiny spoke-rim wheels and customized 
mini-trucks with expensive stereo systems roll slowly up and down the street. 
The thundering sounds of thrumming mufflers, roaring engines and car stereos 
blasting out funky raps blend across the night air. 
</P>
<P>
Low-rider sedans, so close to the ground they seem to hug the street, are 
packed with spirited, mostly Latino, teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The sleek automobiles have been polished to a shiny splendor just for this 
evening. The object here is to see and be seen, to flirt and rap with the other 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
Whether on Saviers Road, A Street or Cooper Road, cruising is part of Oxnard's 
history. It has been around since before many of today's cruisers were even 
born. 
</P>
<P>
However, in sharp contrast to cities such as Los Angeles and Hollywood, where 
cruising has been banned because of noise, traffic and gang violence, cruising 
in Oxnard has been nearly trouble-free, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, hard-core cruisers who get hassled by police in nearby cities are 
turning up on Saviers Road. 
</P>
<P>
"The cruisers are very well-mannered," said Oxnard Police Sgt. Denny Phillips, 
who has overseen police patrols of Saviers Road for the last six months. "I've 
seen cruising here for years. We've got cruisers who come from as far as Santa 
Maria. I talked to one from Victorville." 
</P>
<P>
Even the most vocal critics of cruising in Oxnard are not looking to end the 
weekly event -- they just want to put some controls on the noise and litter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to close down cruising," said Jean Joneson, who has written to 
the police chief and complained to the City Council about noise generated by 
the cruisers. "I used to do this myself when I was younger." 
</P>
<P>
Joneson, who lives on Iris Street about a block from the cruising strip, said 
the noise from the engines and car stereos routinely rattles her windows until 
late at night. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said that when her two teen-age daughters are old enough, she will 
not prohibit them from cruising. "My kids are going to be old enough to 
cruise," she said. "But my kids are going to do it by the rules, and they are 
going to be in by 10." 
</P>
<P>
Cruising -- a California tradition that is both a social event and a 
celebration of the automobile -- attracts 300 to 500 youngsters to Saviers 
every Sunday night. On holidays, such as the Fourth of July or Labor Day, the 
strip can attract twice that number. 
</P>
<P>
Regulars on Saviers said people can cruise in any car, but the nicer, the 
shinier, the flashier the car, the greater the attention. 
</P>
<P>
The cruisers begin to show up on Saviers about 9 p.m. At a speed usually not 
exceeding 15 m.p.h., the cars drive up Saviers, make a U-turn on Yucca Street, 
drive back down the road and cut another U-turn on Iris Street. They repeat the 
route until about 1 a.m., when most cruisers head home. 
</P>
<P>
For William Ellis, Saviers is the place to show off his 1982 Toyota mini-truck. 
Ellis, a 20-year-old Camarillo resident who works at an automobile dealership, 
has spent about $5,000 on chrome, black and gold-flecked paint, upholstery and 
other customizing. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see the looks I get when I'm not with a woman," he said, gesturing 
to his girlfriend in the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ellis said his biggest expense is the 37 tickets he has received in 
the last three years. Most are "fix-it" tickets for his customized hydraulic 
system, which allows Ellis to jack up his truck at the flick of a switch. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said he usually removes the hydraulics to clear the citation from his 
driving record and then reinstalls the system for the next night of cruising. 
The process costs him $400 to $500 each time in fines and labor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only hobby I have, and I get hassled for it by the police," he said. 
"It really ticks me off." 
</P>
<P>
When he came to Oxnard in 1963, Phillips said cruising took place Friday night 
on A Street. But the 1970s construction of the Plaza Mall narrowed A Street, he 
said, and forced cruisers to move to Cooper Road near La Colonia, a gritty, 
mostly Latino neighborhood in northeast Oxnard. Bottle-throwing and other 
violence on the street then drove the cruisers to Saviers Road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although cruising on Saviers has been mostly trouble-free, Phillips said the 
Oxnard Police Department has reorganized patrol shifts so that at least five 
units are assigned to Saviers between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very well-mannered and well-behaved. In the last six months, I've had 
no back talk," he said of the cruisers. "The regulars know the rules. They 
don't loiter, park or drink." 
</P>
<P>
There has been almost no violence or drinking in the last six months, Phillips 
said. Most of the 70 to 80 tickets issued on Saviers in the last year have been 
for mechanical violations or stereos that are too loud. 
</P>
<P>
Fire engines and ambulances know to avoid Saviers on Sunday night, he said. And 
cruisers leave the right-hand shoulder of the street clear for the police, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, police decided to see how many residents in the neighborhood 
surrounding Saviers had problems with cruisers. Police, using a computer with 
an automatic telephone dialing program, randomly called 185 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 90 residents who responded, only 35 said cruising was a problem, Senior 
Crime Analyst David Keith said. Most of the residents who complained said 
traffic congestion was the biggest problem, while a smaller percentage said 
noise and litter were a problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
e Saviers cruising route is mostly lined with restaurants, clothing stores, 
barbershops and automobile supply companies -- many of which are closed on 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The businesses that are open, such as the McDonald's near Hughes Drive, act as 
a pit stop for the parade of sleek and polished road machines. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Barron, who has been a security guard at McDonald's on Saviers for 22 
years, said he has seen it all. Usually the cruisers are well-mannered and 
cause no problems, he said. But sometimes gang members or cruisers from out of 
town will try to stir up trouble, Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the extra traffic that Sunday-night cruising attracts to the restaurant 
does not necessarily mean more business. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually all they do is buy a small Coke and leave," Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
To most of the regular cruisers, the obvious question is still unanswered: Why 
Saviers and why Sunday night? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just always been that way and always will be, I guess," said Mitch 
Barrios, vice president of City Life Car Club, one of the oldest car clubs in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising has become a family tradition for Barrios, a 30-year-old courier for a 
medical company, who said he has been a regular cruiser in Oxnard since he was 
15. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday night, he drove to Saviers in a friend's 1972 gold-flecked 
Chevy Impala with his wife, Leticia, and his 17-year-old sister, Veronica. His 
two children were at home with a sitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Cruising is here to stay," Barrios said. "It's been here for years and nobody 
is going to get rid of it, no matter what they do." 
</P>
<P>
For Veronica Barrios, a recent high school graduate who wears her brown hair 
curly and piled high, cruising on Saviers is a chance to gossip with friends 
and meet boys. 
</P>
<P>
She said her strategy is to wave or smile to the boys in the nicest cars. If 
they seem to be interested, she said, she'll flash out her phone number with 
her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
"Saviers is exciting," she said. "The best. The very best."

rattles the windows of her house. ; Photo, Marc Montalvo, left, Veronica

AQMD IS TOLD ACID BAN MIGHT DOOM REFINERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One small Santa Fe Springs oil refinery said it would have to close and another 
said its existence would be threatened if air quality officials enact a 
proposed ban on the bulk use of hydrofluoric acid at their plants. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District says the ban is needed to 
prevent a potential catastrophe that could threaten the lives of thousands 
living near four Southland refineries and a refrigerant manufacturing plant 
that use the acutely hazardous substance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four refineries that use the substance have previously complained 
about the financial burden of converting to less volatile sulfuric acid, the 
statements by the Golden West and Powerine spokesmen during an AQMD hearing 
Friday mark the first time that industry officials have said refineries might 
have to close. 
</P>
<P>
A final hearing on the proposed ban, which is to include comment on 
environmental and socioeconomic impact reports, is scheduled for Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Both sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids are used in a process that boosts the 
octane of unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD has previously cited industry-sponsored tests that showed a two-minute 
release of 1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid would form a dense, 
ground-hugging cloud of gas and vapor that could threaten life five miles 
downwind. Also cited was a history of accidents that resulted in large-scale 
releases of the substance. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's hearing, Golden West spokesman David Drag said flatly that a 
hydrofluoric acid ban "would force the closure of the refinery" and that the 
immediate consequences would be the loss of 250 refinery jobs, as well as 1,000 
positions in the Thrifty Oil gas station chain. Noting that Thrifty, Golden 
West's main customer for gasoline, is the area's largest independent gasoline 
retailer, Drag said the ban "would result in higher gasoline prices" for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Powerine spokesman David Moore said the refinery "would be placed in jeopardy" 
by elimination of hydrofluoric acid. He said tight space on refinery grounds 
would prevent the refinery from constructing a sulfuric acid unit while 
continuing to operate the hydrofluoric acid unit. 
</P>
<P>
Two larger refineries -- Mobil in Torrance and Ultramar in Wilmington -- also 
use the chemical to boost the octane of unleaded gasoline and also oppose the 
regulation, but they have stopped short of saying the conversion to sulfuric 
acid would force a closure. At the hearing, Ultramar proposed a study, review 
and possible conversion process that could take up to 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Allied Signal, the fifth large-scale user that also would come under the 
proposed ban, uses hydrofluoric acid to make refrigerants and has said it would 
have to close its El Segundo plant because no substitute exists for 
hydrofluoric acid in its process. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic consequences, industry consultant Geoffrey Kaiser 
said the air quality agency was premature in declaring that hydrofluoric acid 
poses an unacceptable risk. Kaiser said the agency should first set a uniform 
standard for acceptable risk before imposing a ban and then measure the risk of 
a serious accident involving continued hydrofluoric acid against that standard. 
</P>
<P>
But Kaiser declined to answer when AQMD planning director Barry Wallerstein 
asked him how many people would have to suffer serious consequences before an 
incident would be rated a major accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to defer that," Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
In the largest recent accident involving hydrofluoric acid, 4,000 people were 
evacuated in 1987 when a cloud of hydrofluoric acid vapors escaped from the 
Marathon refinery in Texas City, Tex. The accident resulted when a 30-ton piece 
of equipment fell from a crane onto pipes from a tank that contained thousands 
of gallons of hydrofluoric acid. About 1,000 people were treated in area 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas industry spokesmen complained about the proposed regulation during the 
hearing, Torrance resident Bernie Hollander, a retired chemical engineer, was 
the only voice at the hearing urging air quality officials to enact the ban. 
</P>
<P>
In his experience, he said, human error was a frequent cause of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"You can trace it to the corporate mentality" that values production over 
safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Hollander said a 1987 explosion at Mobil's hydrofluoric acid 
unit in Torrance happened because safety systems were disabled.

GYPSY BOOTS PUTS ON A SHOW FOR HIS 80TH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Gypsy Boots, good-health guru of Camarillo, another day became another 
decade as the garlic-munching, football-tossing free spirit pronounced his 80th 
birthday a week early. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always be a child," Boots said Saturday, sporting hot pink socks and 
sandals. He fielded football passes at Camarillo City Hall to prove how 
energetic he still is and proclaimed, "I love life, and I love people." 
</P>
<P>
Boots garnered unconventional fame as a regular on the early 1960s "Steve Allen 
Show," for which he was billed as the vegetarian Nature Boy. He still appears 
regularly at Los Angeles sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Born Robert Bootzin in San Francisco in 1910, the soon-to-be octogenarian says 
he has always been a little ahead of his time. In fact, he is about eight days 
ahead; the actual date of his birthday is Aug. 19. But his birthday bash was 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug 19, he intends to have a party for his fans in Los Angeles. But to prove 
to his Ventura County friends that he is not going to neglect them, he decided 
to have two. 
</P>
<P>
What does a Nature Boy do on his birthday? He takes a one-mile jog to prove 
he's not about to give up, then eats a meal of fruit and carrot cake. About 15 
well-wishers gathered in a shopping center parking lot to greet Boots and share 
in the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Anderson, 21, of Santa Barbara was one of four young women who 
accompanied Boots as he jogged briskly on a city street. Anderson said she and 
a friend met Boots on a beach and decided "he's quite a guy. "We were impressed 
with his whole energy." 
</P>
<P>
Boots was surrounded by a bevy of energetic female fans, a few in their 20s and 
some in the over-40 crowd. They watched him take a twirl with a belly dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 65, and he's 80, and he's in better shape than I am," said longtime friend 
Joann Brentley of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Boots says the key to longevity are daily doses of garlic, baths in a cold 
stream and daily exercise. His constant smile proves that he is a truly happy 
man, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"People say to me, 'Don't you get old?' " Boots said. "I say, 'Yeah, I can't 
wait to be 1,000.' " PSYCHE PASCUAL

PICKINGS WEREN'T SLIM AT MUSIC FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
CAMARILLO: THE CITY'S ANNUAL SHOWCASE ATTRACTS 300 PEOPLE TO DIZDAR PARK.

<P>
They brought guitars and picks, potato chips and dips to Camarillo's Acoustic 
Music Festival, where 300 people gathered Saturday for an outdoor feast of folk 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
During the 10-act show, children shrieked on a carousel, babies crawled on the 
grass and women played cards in the sun, as music wafted over Dizdar Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enjoying all of them so far," said Mary Ellen Smith, 68, of Oxnard, as she 
sat in a lawn chair overseeing her three grandchildren under a shade tree. "And 
I'm not one for the blues. I like something peppy." 
</P>
<P>
What started out as an outdoor jam session 10 years ago has evolved into an 
annual folk and rhythm-and-blues festival, but it has retained its 
unconventional, informal ambience. Scheduling changes, a cancellation and an 
act added at the last minute were all part of Ventura County's home-grown 
acoustic festival. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians sang and performed on guitars, mandolins, violins, harmonicas and, in 
one case, a string bass. Some resurrected the music of past years, singing the 
torch songs of Patsy Cline and strumming the melodies of blues guitarist Muddy 
Waters. 
</P>
<P>
When the event was organized, "we just did it because we had some time on our 
hands," said festival organizer Mike Fishell, who plays guitar professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out small. It started out strictly to have fun in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the musicians are from Ventura County, many of them little-known except 
in smoky bars and restaurants, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the bands here, we wouldn't hear them perform if it weren't for this 
festival," Fishell said. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians stood atop a plywood-and-cinder-block bandstand under an old oak 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Salazar, 35, of Ventura, who plays with The Acousticats, picked on a 
mandolin, then traded it in for a bow and violin to play with his wife, 
guitarist Kim Loucks, 35. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a tradition," said Salazar, who has performed in nine of the 10 
acoustic festivals. Camarillo hosts one of only 10 acoustic music festivals 
held each year in California, and this one is one of his favorites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the popularity of acoustic music at outdoor events, many of the 
musicians have had a difficult time finding an audience for folk music in the 
bars and nightclubs where they make their living, Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can square-dance to this music, but you can't rock 'n' roll to it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the growth of the folk music audience and the devoted crowd it draws 
each year has Fishell talking about making the show an international festival 
that would draw musicians from far and wide. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the instruments have to be as conventional as guitars and mandolins, 
Fishell said. In past years, musicians have performed percussion pieces on 
cardboard boxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, "we had another guy play that used a milk crate and a hubcap," 
he said. "He brought the house down."

The endangered El Segundo Blue butterfly already has a couple of protected 
places to live. Chevron U.S.A. provides a habitat on sand dunes within its El 
Segundo refinery property. 
</P>
<P>
And a little to the north, Los Angeles International Airport protects the tiny 
butterfly on coastal dunes west of the runways. 
</P>
<P>
But is the thumbnail-sized creature with blue wings flying anywhere else in El 
Segundo? That's what the Tree Musketeers would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if there are any around the city, and that's why we want people 
to report" any they see, said Tara Church, the 12-year-old youth director of 
the El Segundo children's ecology group that works to improve the environment 
by planting trees and encouraging recycling. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of attracting the butterfly, youngsters in the group are working to 
create habitat areas in the city. They launched their project on Earth Day, 
April 22, by planting natural vegetation at Imperial Highway and Hillcrest 
Avenue. They are now working on a proposal to plant natural vegetation beneath 
power lines of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power along the city's 
western border near the Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion itself is getting into the act, with plans for planting wild 
vegetation on a bluff on the plant's east side. No timetable has been set for 
that project, however. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Church, adult executive director of Tree Musketeers, said it takes about a 
year to create a habitat area. Vegetation not native to the area must be 
removed and the land replanted in native trees and wildflowers. Buckwheat, 
which provides food for the El Segundo Blue butterfly, "blooms as beautiful 
flowers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For butterfly spotters, the Tree Musketeers' number is 322-0263. GERALD FARIS

HIGH-TECH DEVICE WILL KEEP TABS ON GANG MEMBERS

<P>
Faced with escalating gang violence, including murder, the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department is testing a way to keep gang members off the streets 
during times of trouble by using a computer. 
</P>
<P>
It works this way: 
</P>
<P>
Gang members who are on probation will be told to stay home during "Red 
Alerts," declared by the Probation Department -- in conjunction with police and 
sheriff's deputies -- when conflict threatens to escalate into open warfare. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure that they do that, a computer will telephone the designated gang 
members at random during the hours they are restricted. The computer will 
direct them to state their names and repeat after the computer as it names 
several states. 
</P>
<P>
The computer will then electronically analyze their responses and compare the 
findings with voice tapes made earlier. If the computer questions any of its 
contacts, it will notify monitors, and a probation officer will be sent to 
check in person. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month pilot program will be tried first at Aliso Village, a city 
housing project east of downtown near the San Bernardino Freeway. The project 
is home territory of at least 10 gangs, described by authorities as "very, very 
reactive and violent." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some recent shootings there, and . . . we're really worried 
that all hell could break out," said Probation Department Deputy Director 
Michael Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find a way to stop it. . . . We're saying, 'Let's try something 
unique.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey is optimistic that it can make a difference in protecting the public 
and gang members themselves from gang-related violence that has changed 
drastically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran probation official recalls that in the early 1970s feuding gang 
members intent on retaliation generally played pranks or fought, with a 
stabbing "once in a while" or a rare shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, when we have retaliation, we really worry about drive-by 
shootings," Lindsey said. "We worry about innocent victims. . . . We worry 
about whether it's going to escalate, because there are so many guns out there. 
So much firepower and the gangs can become very violent." 
</P>
<P>
And the threat is growing, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Wong, supervising deputy probation officer of the East Los Angeles gang 
unit, said that so far this year there have been at least 15 gang-related 
murders in her area, which includes unincorporated regions of East Los Angeles 
and Eastside neighborhoods within the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At this time last year, 13 people had died in gang-related slayings in her 
area, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
She estimated that there are now at least 82 "very big, active gangs" on the 
Eastside alone. In the last year, she said, "they've become extremely violent." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey expects the computer-monitor program to be in place sometime this 
month. If it is deemed a success, he wants to extend electronic monitoring to 
the entire county, with upward of 1,000 gang members in the system eventually. 
</P>
<P>
But first, the present program must be perfected, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The $19,000 system employs a computer and voice-analysis software provided free 
to the Probation Department for six months by BI Inc., a Boulder, Colo., firm. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, four college students are preparing background information for the 
computer on 100 designated gang members. Next, deputy probation officers will 
record their charges' voices for comparison by computer. 
</P>
<P>
When gang trouble develops, the police and probation officers will identify the 
street gangs involved, determine what members are on probation and tell them 
individually to stay home for periodic checks by the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey hopes that computer-monitoring will afford soft-core gang members an 
excuse to stay out of trouble.

BOARD AGREES TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE COURTHOUSE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, faced with busloads of angry 
homeowners, agreed last week to consider another site for the courthouse that 
the county planned to build in Chatsworth, despite previous rejection of the 
alternative site. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the board postponed a decision on the site at Plummer 
Street and Winnetka Avenue, which is strongly supported by court officials, and 
instructed county real estate experts to inquire about an alternative 
Chatsworth location backed by the homeowners, Supervisor Mike Antonovich and 
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff was asked to report back in a week on the availability and 
price of the alternative site at Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Marilla Street, 
about two miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 angry homeowners chartered school buses to attend Tuesday's board 
meeting and urge the supervisors to reject the Plummer-Winnetka site. 
</P>
<P>
But Municipal Court Administrator Edward M. Kritzman told the supervisors that 
that was the only practical location for the three-story courthouse. The parcel 
is large enough to accommodate a courthouse and parking, is well located and 
would blend into an area already dotted with light industrial and commercial 
buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kritzman said the property favored by Antonovich would cost taxpayers millions 
of dollars more. The lumberyard on the property would have to be dismantled, 
and the county would have to construct an $8-million parking garage because the 
site is too small for surface parking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County real estate experts earlier considered and rejected the Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard site, along with other locations in the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Antonovich contended that the Topanga Canyon property would be more 
economical because it would cost less than the property on Plummer. The Plummer 
parcel, he added, is unacceptable because the community opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a good neighbor makes better sense than jamming down the throats of a 
community a courthouse," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the courthouse would increase traffic, clog their streets with 
parked cars and reduce the value of nearby houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not buy a house in any area where there is a courthouse," said Myrna 
Lightstone, a real estate broker. "Chatsworth is a very quiet neighborhood. I 
want to see Chatsworth stay a very quiet neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Kritzman said neighbors, who have obtained about 1,000 signatures on petitions 
opposing the project, are angry because they mistakenly believe that a jail 
will be in the building. He said this is the first time that a community has 
opposed the construction of a municipal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Board members gave the residents no indication how they would resolve the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who grilled both sides rigorously, said: "Every 
other week we're sitting around here listening to people who don't want 
something in their back yards."

In reference to The Times' July 31 article on Orange County savings and loans' 
first-quarter performance, your headline, "S&amp;Ls in County Post $92-Million 
1st Quarter Loss," was very misleading and damaging to the healthy, privately 
owned and operated institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The government officially releases separate numbers for privately run savings 
institutions and for those that are run by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Your headline led the reader to conclude that, as a whole, the Orange County 
S&amp;L industry is in dire shape. In fact, privately run S&amp;Ls -- 24 in 
total -- in Orange County reported a $43-million profit for the quarter. 
Government-run institutions -- four in total -- lost $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
We are concerned that your headlines create a false and harmful impression 
about the vast majority of savings institutions in Orange County.

COOKS HAVE been using garlic for more than 5,000 years; and its 
heart-protecting, bacteria-fighting properties have become as well known as its 
flavor. Just as notable is garlic's aromatic calling card -- though garlic 
breath does not, in fact, originate in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The odor-producing components of the vegetable, called allicins, are carried by 
blood stream to the lungs, where they are expelled in the act of breathing. 
</P>
<P>
The sacrifice of social intercourse for flavor is no longer necessary. A new 
line of condiments renders the pungent plant socially benign without 
compromising culinary and healthful attributes. "We have simply added things so 
the allicins are neutralized in the digestive process before being circulated 
to the lungs," says Mr. Garlic products inventor Zain Sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Garlic products, which contain no chemicals or preservatives, are 
available at some Ralphs, Gelson's, Mayfair and Westward Ho markets.

MAGICAL KITCHEN HELPERS FOR BAKERS

<P>
ONCE IN A WHILE something so simple and practical comes along that you wonder 
how you ever got along without it. Take the Von Snedaker Magic Baking Set. 
</P>
<P>
It consists of four non-stick, reusable pieces of Teflon-coated Fiberglas 
pre-cut to fit an eight-inch-square utility pan, a 5x9-inch loaf pan and two 
round nine-inch cake or pie pans. (There is also a Von Snedaker Magic Baking 
Sheet, which measures 17 1/4x14 1/2 inches and fits most cookie sheets.) 
</P>
<P>
No spraying or greasing is necessary when baking (up to 500 degrees) with these 
pieces. Just place one in the desired pan, and cakes, pies and brownies turn 
out with no sticking at all. The Magic Baking Set cleans easily with a damp 
cloth and is microwave- and dishwasher-safe; and the pieces store conveniently 
in their own 9 1/2x12 1/2-inch envelope. 
</P>
<P>
The only prohibition for the magical baking pans is that you can't cut on them; 
a cut scores the finish and makes food stick. But if that should happen, you 
can simply turn the piece over and use the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Von Snedaker Magic Baking Set is available at Lawry's Gift Shop, Lawry's 
California Center, 570 West Avenue 26, Los Angeles, (213) 224-6800, and at 
other area cook stores. Or telephone Von Snedaker, (213) 395-6365.

<TEXT>
<P>
A number of Arab leaders arrived at last week's emergency summit meeting 
prepared to offer Iraqi President Saddam Hussein substantial incentives for 
pulling out of Kuwait, including cash payoffs and loan credits, increased 
control of a disputed oil field and a face-saving way to withdraw his forces, 
sources close to the talks said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But negotiations were cut off even before they began when the Iraqi delegation, 
furious about Saudi Arabia's summoning of a U.S. defensive force, began 
denouncing the Saudi leaders as "traitors" and "American agents." The Iraqis 
said secret documents seized from the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry proved that 
Kuwait had been plotting with the CIA against Iraq, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis refused everything. They were very tough, savage. Even the 
formalities they didn't take," said one Egyptian familiar with the discussions. 
"Usually in these things, you talk in terms of 'Your Excellency,' politeness, 
that sort of thing. That was all out." 
</P>
<P>
A deeply divided Arab League, racked with dissent over U.S. intervention in the 
conflict, emerged from the meeting with a resolution supported by only slightly 
more than half of its members -- and an ongoing public opinion battle at home 
over whether the belligerent Iraqi president is a dangerous villain or a 
national hero. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is now over the Arab masses," Egyptian diplomat Tahseen Bashir said 
after Hussein called, on the day of the summit, for Arabs to rise up against 
foreign intervention and the wealthy oil sheiks who he said have plundered the 
Arab nations' wealth and left most Arabs in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Some Arabs appear to be ready to heed the call. On Friday in Amman, Jordan, 
hundreds of Muslim militants declared holy war on the United States and urged 
Jordan to send troops to fight for Iraq. Thousands more demonstrated Saturday 
in Sana, Yemen, in front of the embassies of the United States, Saudi Arabia 
and Egypt, expressing support for Iraq's Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, hundreds of Egyptians have applied in recent days at the 
Kuwaiti Embassy in Cairo as volunteers to join popular resistance forces 
against the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We can say that the Iraqis are building a kind of coalition, not necessarily 
among governments but within factions and within the public itself," said Abdel 
Monem Said, a senior Egyptian political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, he said, has begun to win over to his side Arab nationalists, such as 
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, who dream of a single Arab nation with no 
interior borders, and radical Muslim fundamentalists who opposed Iraq's 1980-88 
war with Iran but who see Hussein as a vehicle to destabilize the existing Arab 
order. In addition, the disfranchised of the Arab world, such as members of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, see Hussein as a moving train to hitch onto 
at a time when most other roads seem blocked. 
</P>
<P>
On top of all of this, analysts say, is the failure of moderate political 
forces to resolve the long-running Palestinian problem and an economic crisis 
that has ground down the Arab world from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The economic crunch has become particularly acute in the last three years. It 
makes more and more struggling Arabs in places such as Jordan and Sudan ready 
to believe Hussein when he says that the problems were the fault of "oil emirs" 
such as Kuwait's ruling family. 
</P>
<P>
For all those reasons, in addition to the general desire to resolve the crisis, 
several Arab leaders were prepared to offer Hussein substantial concessions to 
withdraw his forces from Kuwait, according to sources close to last week's 
summit discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the inducements under discussion, they said, were forgiveness of Iraq's 
multibillion-dollar war debt to Kuwait, a cash settlement of Iraq's claim that 
Kuwait illegally pumped $2.4-billion worth of crude oil from wells along its 
disputed border with Iraq, perhaps even "some advantage" in control of the 
disputed Rumaila oil field that extends beneath the territories of both 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Although Arab governments have been virtually unanimous in demanding the return 
to power of the exiled Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, there was 
even some discussion before Friday's emergency meeting of leaving the sheik in 
exile, pending the scheduling of elections in Kuwait, according to two sources. 
Arab leaders believe that the emir would probably prevail in such elections, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which was less inclined to placate Hussein, was the leader in 
discussions of a pan-Arab peacekeeping force that would replace the Iraqi 
troops in Kuwait and then withdraw to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border to serve as a 
buffer force. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt also led a bloc of harder-line countries that were insisting on the kind 
of strong resolution finally adopted by 12 of the 20 Arab League leaders at the 
meeting. That resolution strongly condemns Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, 
implicitly supporting Saudi Arabia's call for outside military intervention and 
calling for the deployment of Arab troops to hold off any more aggression from 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Some conference sources said there might have been much wider support for the 
resolution if it had not been for the section endorsing non-Arab military 
intervention -- an issue that proved to be the most divisive of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Even Libya, several sources said, favored the pullout of Iraqi troops from 
Kuwait and the restoration of the emir's government, but Libya's Kadafi refused 
to have anything to do with supporting a role for U.S. military forces, 
according to one source close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Libya voted against the resolution, as did the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and Iraq. The five other holdouts -- Algeria, Yemen, Jordan, Sudan 
and Mauritania -- either abstained or expressed "reservations." Tunisia did not 
send a representative to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In many senses the summit meeting was a success, even if it did not achieve a 
compromise solution to the crisis or unanimous support for a course of action, 
because it "forced everyone to admit that it was indeed an Arab problem that 
had to be dealt with," said one Western diplomat who closely followed the 
deliberations. The diplomat continued: 
</P>
<P>
"It at least forced everyone to confront the issue, and in many ways, it kind 
of frees Egypt up now to pursue its own policies separate from the league, 
having done its duty by calling a summit." 
</P>
<P>
Bashir, the Egyptian diplomat, said diplomacy as an option has not necessarily 
been exhausted, even with the harsh summit resolution and Egypt's subsequent 
decision to dispatch troops to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of them realized at this stage that a deal was very difficult to 
reach," he said. "So, they concentrated instead on tightening the noose. 
They're still hoping that this might produce in weeks or months a frame of mind 
for Saddam Hussein to negotiate."

2-CAREER FAMILY DILEMMA: BALANCING WORK AND HOME; 
</P>
<P>
POLL: A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER WOULD QUIT WORK AND STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF 
THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Haunted by anxiety about spending too little time with their children, nearly 
40% of fathers and 80% of mothers in Los Angeles and Orange counties say they 
would quit their jobs, if they could, to rear their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
Most parents say they are often overwhelmed by the responsibilities of 
child-rearing and worry about whether they are doing a good job of it, 
according to a Los Angeles Times-commissioned survey of 1,000 households in the 
two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Some social historians say the findings reflect a "new realism" about the 
financial and emotional toll that an 80-hour work week inflicts on dual-earner 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached a time when we're more realistic of what the costs are of 
full-time employment for two-earner families," said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, a 
social historian and consultant with the Chicago-based Public Policy Assn. The 
top two responsibilities of parenthood -- providing financial security and 
passing on values -- are on a collision course that will continue at least 
through the decade or until the economy eases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll, conducted July 19-23 by Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp; 
Associates, surveyed an equal number of men and women, evenings and weekends, 
in English and Spanish. The margin of error is 3 to 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Among other findings on the state of the family: 
</P>
<P>
* Many cannot live up to their ideals of even the most mundane family 
traditions, such as eating dinner together. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles County parents perceive crime as the top problem threatening 
their children, while Orange County parents think substance abuse is the 
greatest threat. 
</P>
<P>
* Parents are apparently motivated to join the rat race by what is also one of 
their biggest concerns in rearing children: money. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day is a challenge and a balancing act," said single mother Linda 
Sonnonstine, 42, of Irvine, who left a corporate communications job in Los 
Angeles for one in Long Beach to reduce her commute and have more time for her 
son, Benji, 13.

"Something suffers, either the child, the relationship with your significant 
other, or the job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the poll suggests that Southern Californians, whether 
mainstream or non-traditional, care profoundly about family life. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, about eight in 10 said the most important things in their lives are 
family and children, marriage and love, and financial security -- more 
important than work and career or leisure time. Two-thirds also called family 
and love life the most satisfying aspects of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
But that focus often turns to guilt for spending too little time with the 
children, according to 57% of the fathers and 55% of the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
For Benay Clark, facing her 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Mallory, before her 
husband takes the girl to day care each morning is "a real struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Mallory clings to her; she says she's scared; she asks why Clark has 
to have a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I've cried on my way to work many times," said Clark, a 35-year-old 
administrative clerk living in the West Hills area of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Quintanilla Smith, who runs the child-care center where Mallory spends 
her days, said she often sees tears on parents' faces as well as children's. 
Mothers and fathers tell her they "had a parent home when they were children 
and they wish they could do the same. But they can't," because their financial 
situation forces them to work. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six percent of residents in Los Angeles and Orange counties agreed with 
Smith and said two incomes are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Working parents, particularly men, believed strongly that the demands of the 
job are taking a toll at home. A little more than half of the men said the job 
they are doing as a parent has suffered "a lot" or "some," contrasted with 39% 
of the women who felt that way. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Pat Donovan, 42, was divorced and given custody of his two children. 
For two years, he continued to work long, erratic hours at Bendix Field 
Engineering near Barstow, squeezing in trips to the beach and the zoo on the 
one weekend a month he had off. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, he decided that his children needed him more than he needed his 
job: "If you neglect your car long enough, it's going to break down. If you 
neglect your children, something down the line will happen you'll be sorry 
for." 
</P>
<P>
So Donovan moved his family to Morrisville, N.Y., took a job with better hours 
and devoted more time to his family. With his children in their teens, he has 
returned to California and a better-paying job in Pasadena with his former 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan realizes that his salary has suffered as a result of his focus on 
child-rearing. But the daily rewards of watching his children mature, seeing 
his daughter in her dance recitals and his son in wrestling tournaments more 
than compensate for any slippage on the career ladder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist and syndicated columnist Dr. Joyce Brothers attributed the 
closeness many men feel to their children to changes in domestic attitudes and 
behavior. In America today, only 10% of the homes fit the traditional 
"breadwinner" model where the father goes off to work and the mother stays home 
to take care of the children, according to a study by the Ford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Fathers have "held more crying infants in the middle of the night; they've fed 
them, rocked them, changed their diapers, to say nothing of talking with school 
and camp counselors and attending PTA meetings," Brothers said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Donovan, only 28% of the fathers reported the demands of parenthood have 
hurt their work careers, while 41% of the mothers believe family priorities 
have forced them to scale back their careers. 
</P>
<P>
The findings helped confirm a June survey by Catalyst, a New York-based 
not-for-profit research and advisory group that found a majority of corporate 
human relations professionals still perceive work and family conflicts to be a 
"women's issue." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure now for men to say they would like to spend more 
time with their families," but little evidence showing they do, said Mary 
Mattis, vice president of research for Catalyst. "For the most part, women are 
still working two jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rebecca Wexler had just begun a residency program in radiology when her 
second child, Rachael, was born last year. There was no question what she would 
do: "I wanted to be at home with her when she was little." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena resident knew she might not be able to get back into the extremely 
competitive radiology program. "People may look down on the fact that I 
interrupted this residency," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Tony, who is completing his doctorate in mechanical 
engineering, are also well aware of the financial implications of their 
decision. "The mean salary for radiologists is $160,000 a year," Tony said with 
a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Tony believes he devotes more time to child care than his peers. He feels close 
to his children. But he would not have made the career sacrifice Rebecca made. 
He is unsure why, but suspects that his wife, by bearing and breast-feeding the 
children, developed a stronger bond. "Women's stake is much higher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Rebecca remains strongly committed to her career. When the 
children are napping, for instance, she reads her radiology journals. But she 
does not regret her decision. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who were polled tended to idealize family togetherness, ranking family 
activities as highly important. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, 95% of respondents agreed in theory that a good chat about school 
or other children's issues is important, 86% believe in the importance of 
having regular family dinners, and 82% say that families need to go to the 
movies or the beach together. But in practice, many fell short of reaching 
their ideals. 
</P>
<P>
Only three-quarters said they managed to talk with their children about school 
and other children's issues. Single parents said they talk less with their 
children, and attach less importance to doing so. And only 66% said they have a 
regular dinner hour together. 
</P>
<P>
The largest gap fell between those who felt it was important to attend church 
services, 65%, and those who said they actually attended, 48%. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also confirmed what is already apparent to many -- that family forms 
are changing. 
</P>
<P>
Three in 10 households with children are so-called "blended families" -- 
including children from previous marriages; 18% of the parents are rearing 
their children alone and often facing even more difficulties than their peers 
in two-parent families. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Thompson of Altadena is studying at Cal State Los Angeles to be a 
teacher. The 22-year-old woman also works full time at the Caltech Children's 
Center in Pasadena. But she cannot afford to send her children there. 
</P>
<P>
So each morning she drops her 5-year-old off at a public school and her 
6-month-old at a baby-sitter. After work, she picks up the children and takes 
them to her mother's house, where they remain while Thompson attends classes. 
At 9 p.m., Thompson picks up the children and returns home, "and then the 
children want time with me." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, when I need to get somewhere and have absolutely no one to turn to 
to baby-sit, or I've just been paid and I know money has to go to rent, bills, 
car payments and I need to go to my mother for food, I think, 'Goodness 
gracious, is it worth it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Invariably, she said, she looks at her children and concludes that it is. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Los Angeles and Orange counties responded almost identically on 
most questions, such as considering two children the ideal family size or 
giving television the lowest priority as a family activity. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles residents were more disappointed with their finances, careers, 
love lives and families than are Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents -- particularly women -- ranked leisure time as more 
important than did their counterparts in Los Angeles or either group of men. In 
fact, 75% of the Orange County women rated it as a "very important" feature of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly one-third of Los Angeles residents said Los Angeles County is a "poor" 
place to rear children, contrasted with only 12% in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In both counties, childless families perceived drugs and alcohol as the biggest 
problem for parents rearing children today. Parents in Orange County agreed, 
but Los Angeles parents said they were most concerned about crime. 
</P>
<P>
Peach Manion, 67, was born in Los Angeles and has seen the stresses of city 
life influence three generations. Her parents lost their Silver Lake home 
during the Depression. As Peach and her husband, Pete, reared their own five 
children, now ages 31 to 44, they worried about alcohol and, later, drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Manion finds herself waiting up and worrying about gangs and crime and 
other urban problems until her 18-year-old grandchild, who lives with her 
parents across the street, comes home at night. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she thinks growing up in the city has been good for the girl, as it was 
for her children, giving them a rounded and realistic view of the world, said 
Manion, adding, "I love this community." 
</P>
<P>
In both counties, parents also worry about schools and lack of time in rearing 
their children. In Orange County, twice as many people as in Los Angeles worry 
about the expense of rearing children. Several of them -- including the most 
affluent -- complained about pervasive materialism. 
</P>
<P>
In the affluent community of Fullerton known as Sunny Hills, homemaker Cindy 
Huff, 39, said all the teen-agers have their own cars, Nintendo sets and the 
equipment and lessons for any sport to which they're drawn. Her three sons have 
all been to private schools, taken lessons in violin, swimming, gymnastics, 
performing arts and various sports. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can buy shoes for it, we've done it," she said. "It's a very 'have' 
society, and it's difficult for them to understand that somebody worked for 
these things, and they were expensive and that not everybody in the world has 
them or is entitled to them by birthright."

How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Family Poll was conducted July 19-23 for the Los Angeles Times by 
Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. The telephone survey used a 
computer-generated random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers to 
contact 1,000 households, including 500 in Orange County and 500 in Los Angeles 
County. For analysis of the two counties, combined results were statistically 
weighted to represent the actual distribution of population in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Interviews were conducted evenings and weekends, in English 
and Spanish, and included an equal number of men and women. All respondents 
were guaranteed anonymity. However, some agreed to be reinterviewed for news 
stories. The margin of error is 3 percentage points for the total sample and 
4.5 percentage points for each county. For subgroups, such as parents, it is 5 
percentage points. Results may not add up to 100% because of rounding.

THE VALLEY: AN URBAN EVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
'AMERICA'S SUBURB' LOOKS MORE LIKE A CITY THESE DAYS. APARTMENTS DISPLACE 
SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES ON THE FLATS, $1-MILLION TRACT HOUSES INVADE HILLS, AND THE 
AREA'S POLITICS SPLINTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the heat and haze, the air of the San Fernando Valley is thick these days 
with nostalgia -- for olive groves and dirt roads, for the ducklings and 
chickens and piglets raised by thousands of schoolchildren in suburban back 
yards, for the summer nights spent cruising Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley stood for something once. Neighborhood schools. Proposition 13. 
Tract houses. Corner stores. It had its own weather (hotter), its own geography 
(insular) and its own politics (isolationist). Periodically, it threatened to 
secede from Los Angeles or, at least, form its own school district. It even 
shunned the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Scorned by intellectuals -- "Nowhere on earth has the land been so wretchedly 
violated," wrote architectural historian Robert Winter -- the Valley led the 
nation in the construction of swimming pools, shopping malls and single-family 
homes. For Look magazine and much of the national press it was America's 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The old imagery hardly seems appropriate anymore. With a population of well 
over a million -- almost as large as Philadelphia -- the Valley has acquired 
much of the heft and glitter, drawbacks and dangers of a big city. When people 
in Los Angeles talk about "the City" and "the Valley" now, it's to emphasize 
the similarities. 
</P>
<P>
But the Valley acts uncomfortable in its urban garb: balking at the notion of 
building a courthouse in this neighborhood, a theater in that one, voting down 
a proposed subway route, preferring to see its growth push out toward the 
mountains rather than intensify along the boulevards. As it grows larger, the 
Valley also grows farther apart, segmenting itself, by geography, class and 
race, and the identity that once seemed so clear starts to disappear, like the 
outline of the San Gabriels on an August afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Fernando Valley is finished, as far as I'm concerned," said Al 
DeGeyeter, who has been selling pearl onions, corn, strawberries and squash for 
40 years from his roadside stand on Sherman Way in Reseda. This is a lean year 
for DeGeyeter. First came the drought, and then worms. He points to a fallow 
field nearby where one crop was infested. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't spray in the middle of the city like this. So you let it go," he 
said. DeGeyeter, 71, said he will retire in a year or two. "There's no money in 
this dirt anymore."

<P>
Catherine Mulholland, her family's name emblazoned on the history of Los 
Angeles, and with it the Valley, feels much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't belong anymore," Mulholland said. "I am like the coyotes and the 
rattlesnakes and the other animal species that are getting pushed out." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland, 67, is the granddaughter of William Mulholland, the self-taught 
engineer who designed the aqueduct that brought the water from Owens Valley to 
Los Angeles and made it possible for millions of people to settle. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Catherine Mulholland lives in a subdivision in Chatsworth. Six miles 
away is the land, now the site of a K mart, where her grandfather built the 
family's ranch and where she grew up. She recalls a charmed life, her friends 
drawn from the families of nearby merchants, ranch hands and celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara Stanwyck had a ranch nearby and so did Roy Rogers," she said. "Sabu 
the Elephant Boy (the late actor Sabu Dastagir) actually had elephants. People 
used to complain about the trumpeting." Mulholland laughed at the memory. 
"Today, it's boomboxes and jet planes." 
</P>
<P>
What she misses most about the old Valley, Mulholland said, is the easy mixing 
of people, races and classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a community of rich and poor. I had a friend whose father sold 
chickens for a living on Winnetka Avenue. On hot nights, we used to sleep on 
top of the coops. . . . There was a Mexican boy in school whose family lived in 
a boxcar. His clothes were pretty ragged and he smelled. I'm sure he got 
teased. But he was there. You knew him." 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of talk in the Valley now of a lost sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley is breaking up," said Arnold Steinberg, a political consultant who 
has been taking public opinion surveys there for 20 years. The new boundaries, 
he said, are being defined by ethnicity, by income and by taste. Telling 
distinctions are drawn. People will say they live in the heavily Anglo "West 
Valley," or the largely Latino "East Valley." Others say they live "south of 
the boulevard," a reference to the expensive hillside neighborhoods south of 
Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"No one says, 'I'm from the Valley' anymore," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hillier and posher quarters of Canoga Park, residents recently renamed 
their neighborhood West Hills and ended their affiliation with one of the 
Valley's most historically significant communities. The 1911 subdivision of 
Canoga Park and 47,000 acres of surrounding ranch land marked the Valley's 
first major step toward urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Valley, communities have circled the wagons to protect against 
unwanted intruders. In Hidden Hills, a gated enclave of million-dollar homes 
bordering Ventura County, residents are waging a legal battle to keep out an 
apartment complex for senior citizens. People in Chatsworth don't want a 
courthouse on their doorstep, and in the Sunland-Tujunga horse country, 
residents wary of new development have opposed the expansion of a religious 
school and even fought to keep out a convent. 
</P>
<P>
As the price of housing rises in the hills and new apartments fill up the 
flats, the prospect of a two-tiered society becomes increasingly real. It is a 
vision of a Valley floor crowded with poor people who don't speak English, 
don't vote and don't own property, surrounded by Anglo homeowners who control 
the wealth and the politics from hillside enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg referred to it as "the coming schizoid society," and evidence of it 
is already on display. 
</P>
<P>
In Calabasas, a phalanx of pink-roofed chateaus spirals up a freshly graded 
hilltop. By definition, these are tract homes -- 800 of them are planned. But 
each costs a minimum of $1 million, and the project is designed to meet a 
growing demand for luxurious country living in the Valley. Inside the houses, 
rooms soar from Italian marble foyers to 20-foot ceilings. Outside, lawns are 
set off by lushly landscaped fountains where the children of prospective buyers 
dip their toes on hot afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Just 20 freeway minutes to the east, on Tobias Avenue in the Sepulveda flats, 
the Valley is catering to another market. Here, the remnants of a neighborhood 
built 40 years ago for an earlier generation of suburban homesteaders are 
boarded up and marked for demolition. Soon, new apartments will go up. 
Immigrants will move in. In the meantime, the back yards of the condemned homes 
have become an arena for a makeshift city sport. Each afternoon, small crowds 
gather there to watch daring young skateboarders careen up the sides of empty 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Sylmar Democrat who for 10 years has 
represented a broad segment of the northern San Fernando Valley, including 
Tobias Avenue, has watched the forces of change at work, and he fears that the 
Valley is losing its traditional ballast. 
</P>
<P>
"What has worried me most over the past seven or eight years," Katz said, "has 
been that the middle class is disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
Katz sees the trend reflected in the loss of single-family homes -- close to 
1,400 were bulldozed to make way for new apartments during the first half of 
the decade -- and in the region's shifting economy. Even before Lockheed 
announced it was shutting down its Burbank operations earlier this year, 
manufacturing jobs had declined by nearly 50% since 1970, according to David 
Hornbeck, a professor of economics and geography at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
As jobs disappear, so do blue-collar Democrats who once anchored the east end 
of Katz's district. As these voters move to the outlying Santa Clarita, Simi 
and Antelope valleys -- San Fernando's nascent suburbs -- their place is taken 
by unskilled, non-voting immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's district, as much as anyplace in the Valley, bears witness to the 
widening gap between rich and poor. At the west end, around Northridge, the 
majority of residents are Anglo, own their homes and make annual salaries 
averaging well over $50,000. At the eastern end of the district, in communities 
like Pacoima and San Fernando, there are more people -- but fewer voters. About 
two-thirds of the population is Latino. Fewer than half the residents own their 
own homes, and the average income is less than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Katz has survived longer in the district than most of his predecessors, but the 
job does not get any easier. He must provide services to the east, while asking 
the more conservative west, which controls the votes, to foot the bill. It 
makes for delicate politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The resistance will come when the voters in the west end feel they are picking 
up the whole tab and not getting any bang for their buck," Katz said. "If you 
raise their taxes and the schools don't get better . . . if you ask them to pay 
more for social services for the poor and it doesn't lead to lower crime . . . 
then, people will balk." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long ago that politics in the Valley were far simpler: lower taxes, 
more police. This was the familiar battle cry back when the Valley spoke with 
one voice. Then, politicians claimed the Valley was being bilked by City Hall 
in downtown Los Angeles -- paying 40 cents of every dollar collected in city 
taxes, but getting back only 15 cents of every dollar spent on municipal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for the Valley's "fair share" fueled the secessionist movement of 
the 1970s, and was one of the last crusades, along with the campaign against 
mandatory school busing, that seemed to unite Valley voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there's no single issue, no one leader that you could say represents 
the Valley," consultant Steinberg said. "Things are so diffuse, the changes so 
severe, they have weakened traditional causes and alliances." 
</P>
<P>
As veteran politicians try to get their bearings in the new urban environment, 
some find it harder to stay in sync with their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins, a Tarzana Democrat who should know his constituents 
well after 17 years in office, spent much of last year supporting an extension 
of the proposed Metro Rail subway from downtown into the Valley, only to have 
his constituents reject it overwhelmingly in a June vote. 
</P>
<P>
After 13 years on the City Council, Joy Picus ran into unexpected resistance 
when she backed a movement to build an arts complex in the Sepulveda Basin. 
With a museum and a performing arts theater, the arts complex would have given 
the Valley a cultural presence that it has long lacked. But it also would have 
consumed a valued piece of open space in the fast-developing West Valley. And 
for many residents, the trade-off wasn't worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have are a bunch of politicians trying to come to grips with the 
Valley's love-hate relationship with development," said one council aide, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
History shows that the Valley has been of two minds about growth for the better 
part of a century. Ironically, some of the people who cherished its rustic 
heritage worked hardest to destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
Author Edgar Rice Burroughs was among those who loved the splendid isolation of 
the Valley but who could not resist tampering with it. In 1919, Burroughs 
bought 550 acres of undeveloped land teeming with deer, coyote and bobcat. He 
named it Tarzana after the vine-swinging hero of his jungle books, who 
expressed Burroughs' love of nature and contempt for civilization. But, within 
three years, Burroughs had succumbed to the worst impulses of Tarzan's enemies. 
Obsessed with making money from his land, he decided to build a town. 
</P>
<P>
By 1925, Tarzana was subdivided into 63 commercial and 139 residential lots. 
Burroughs departed for downtown Los Angeles, according to biographer Roger 
Dionne. Late in his life, the author tried to return to Tarzana, but couldn't 
find a place to live; his town was full up. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1940s, the Valley was on the way to becoming an industrial giant with an 
annual output of $700 million in aircraft, automobiles and motion pictures. 
Before long, it was growing faster than any other metropolitan region of the 
nation. The rural basin was becoming something quite different, not a city 
really, but something else. Developers called it "rurban." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Chandler described its harsher tones when he wrote about a drive 
through the Valley: "I drove on past the gaudy neons and the false fronts 
behind them, the sleazy hamburger joints that look like palaces under the 
colours, the circular drive-ins as gay as circuses with the chipper hard-eyed 
car hops, the brilliant counters, and the sweaty greasy kitchens that would 
have poisoned a toad . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A much more appealing image had fired the imaginations of the emigres who had 
poured in since the end of World War II. Their Valley offered the bucolic 
setting evoked by actor Robert Taylor, who talked about the simple life on his 
alfalfa ranch in Chatsworth. It was the wide-open land of the new lease on life 
immortalized in a Gordon Jenkins' song: 
</P>
<P>
 I'll forget my sins/ I'll be makin' new friends/ Where the West begins and the 
sunset ends./ Cause I've decided where yours truly should be./ And it's the San 
Fernando Valley for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, amid the crush of freeway traffic, pastoral imagery plays a role 
in the marketing of the Valley. Boosters still talk about a simpler, safer 
life. Realtors promote new "horse properties" -- tract houses with split-rail 
fences and hay ricks that look like gazebos. Corporate recruiters describe 
Warner Center with its emerging skyline and 35,000 commuters as a suburban 
office environment, just minutes away from genteel country living. 
</P>
<P>
And the hype still works. Sylmar in the northern Valley was the fastest-growing 
community in the city during the 1980s. Nearly 50% of all new homes built in 
the city during the last decade were built in the Valley. Much of the new 
construction occurred in the foothills surrounding Chatsworth, where ridge 
lines were gouged, oak trees uprooted and barns razed to make way for new 
"country estates." 
</P>
<P>
But there is more than a grain of truth to the hype. The Valley, in some ways, 
remains a place apart. In the most crowded neighborhoods -- North Hollywood and 
Van Nuys -- population density is still only a third of what it is along the 
Wilshire corridor. Although the average cost of a home, $260,000, is more than 
the citywide average, Valley home prices are still substantially lower than 
those in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of serious crime also is markedly lower than the citywide rate. While 
a great deal of attention has been focused on the growth of gang violence, 
veteran police officers say they think the quality of life in the Valley, even 
in the poorest neighborhoods, will prevent gang culture from taking root as 
deeply as it has elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is still a little bit better in the San Fernando Valley, even for poor 
people," said Los Angeles Police Department Detective Cliff Ruff, who spent the 
last eight years in charge of the Valley's anti-street-gang unit before 
retiring in June. "Kids join gangs because it's the macho thing to do. They're 
not doing it so much out of desperation. They're not looking for a father 
figure. The family structure is more visible. The idea that there can be a life 
outside the gang has some meaning." 
</P>
<P>
He calls the Valley's gang problem "manageable." 
</P>
<P>
People of all walks of life still pay homage to the Valley's traditional 
values, tastes and conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant owner Peiro Selvaggio is one of a growing number of West Side 
business people to expand their operations into the Valley. The owner of 
Valentino, one of the West Side's most fashionable eating places, Selvaggio is 
about to open a new restaurant in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Like others hoping to find a niche in the new Valley, Selvaggio said it is 
important not to see it as a clone of Brentwood or Pacific Palisades. He said 
that Posto, his Valley establishment, will be quite different from Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
"Valentino is elegant but a little pretentious," Selvaggio said. "In the Valley 
a place like that could make people feel too scrutinized. I don't want them to 
feel undercapitalized or underdressed. In the Valley, a restaurant should be a 
comforting hangout that happens to be elegant." 
</P>
<P>
In the Valley, Selvaggio said, one must set one's sights carefully. "The middle 
is what I'm aiming at," he said, "because that's where the Valley abounds." 
</P>
<P>
Flip Smith is of that middle-class stock. He sells tires. 
</P>
<P>
One night 20 years ago, Smith drove to a spot on Mulholland Drive overlooking 
the Valley, looked out at the sea of lights and vowed to sell a set of tires to 
every one of the households twinkling below him. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is advancing on that goal. A salesman then, he now owns a tire store 
in Van Nuys. It makes, he said, about $4 million in sales each year. Living in 
the Valley has not always been easy. His kids were bused to schools on the 
other side of the city. Many of his friends have moved away. The proud old 
street, Van Nuys Boulevard, where his business stands and where he cruised as a 
teen-ager, has become a disheveled strip. 
</P>
<P>
But the changes have not dulled his enthusiasm for life in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten rich," he said, "but I have what matters." 
</P>
<P>
Both of his sons, now grown up, work for him. The family gets together around 
Smith's back yard pool on Sundays. And after 19 years, Smith's home in Reseda 
is still five minutes from work. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the changes, the Valley can still look today like it always did. 
Viewed from that spot on Mulholland Drive, where two decades ago Smith surveyed 
a great, untapped tire market, the Valley shimmers below like one great, 
sprawling neighborhood. A flat and placid place, safe from the city; a 
beguiling mirage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley 
</P>
<P>
Extending 24 miles from east to west and about 12 miles from north to south, 
the San Fernando Valley encompasses about 275 square miles and is generally 
bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains on the north, the Verdugo Mountains on the 
east, the Santa Monica Mountains and Hollywood Hills on the south and the 
Agoura Hills, Simi Hills and Santa Susana Mountains on the west.

SOVIET ADVISERS REPORTED AIDING IRAQI MILITARY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet military advisers, estimated to number up to 1,000, remain stationed in 
Iraq and appear to be providing assistance to President Saddam Hussein's armed 
forces despite official Soviet condemnation of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, 
according to U.S. government sources. 
</P>
<P>
The continued involvement of Soviet personnel with the Iraqi military machine 
has created behind-the-scenes friction between Moscow and the United States and 
threatens to strain superpower cooperation in resolving the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our understanding that they have the obligation not to have advisers 
there," a senior U.S. official said Saturday. He said the matter had become "an 
issue" between Washington and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The status of an additional 500 military advisers from other countries who are 
also still believed to be in Iraq remains uncertain, but a second U.S. source 
said that "we assume" that they continue to provide assistance to the Iraqi 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated situation springs from the sudden reversal of long-term 
international support for Hussein -- a turnabout that suddenly puts officially 
sanctioned military advisers in a position contrary to their governments' 
stated foreign policies. 
</P>
<P>
The non-Soviet advisers are largely private citizens, some of them representing 
French and German companies that have sold arms to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials indicated that the United States is troubled by the 
actions of both groups but is more deeply concerned about the work being done 
by the Soviet advisers, whose contributions to Iraqi power and readiness are 
regarded as significant. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials said that the ability of the United States to put effective 
pressure on the Soviet Union and other countries has been limited by the 
possibility that the foreign citizens might have been compelled to work. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that no foreigners are allowed to leave," said one well-placed 
U.S. official. "They are in the same situation as Americans. We'd be in a 
stronger position if people could leave." 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency said Saturday that Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev had ordered the creation of a special government commission to 
organize the evacuation of Soviet citizens in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But the report indicated that only the wives and children of Soviet workers in 
Iraq would be evacuated. And the Defense Ministry press office, in a statement 
published in the armed forces daily Krasnay Zvezda, said that a "small group" 
of Soviet military specialists remain in Iraq "to complete intergovernmental 
agreements." 
</P>
<P>
"In general, they are working in maintenance factories, educational 
institutions and construction sites," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has for more than 20 years been the principal supplier of 
weapons to Iraq, including its most sophisticated tanks and fighter aircraft, 
in a relationship that began after the British-dominated monarchy in Baghdad 
was ousted in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
The thousands of military advisers who have worked in Baghdad over the years 
have taught the Iraqis to use a wide range of purchases, including T-72 tanks 
and MIG-29 warplanes. Other powerful Soviet weapons in the Iraqi stockpile 
include Scud-B ballistic missiles and MI-24 Hind helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. government analyst said the Hussein regime has been "very paranoid" in 
recent years about the presence of the Soviet advisers and tended to keep them 
away from combat and air force units. Most of the advisers now work in 
logistics and maintenance roles, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the nationalities of the estimated 500 other advisers remain 
unknown, in large part because they represent private firms. But apart from 
some Eastern Europeans, they said most of those firms are German and French. 
</P>
<P>
Some governments have limited capacity to compel action by their citizens 
living abroad, even if they are acting in violation of official policy, and 
Administration officials indicated that this could be an obstacle to resolution 
of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no guarantees from any country that their people will come out," one 
official said. But he said that, at least in the case of the European 
nationals, "there's enough good will to eventually make it work. 
</P>
<P>
"The governments involved do understand the irony of having sanctions at the 
same time their citizens are helping with weapons systems," he said.

<P>
After two years as chancellor of the California community colleges -- the 
largest higher education system in the nation -- David Mertes has concluded 
that the system won't work unless he and his central office staff are given 
more authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I've attempted for two years to try to make this system work," Mertes said in 
a recent interview at his downtown Sacramento office. "But, frankly, I've come 
to the conclusion that unless the community colleges are allowed greater leeway 
to conduct their own affairs, we'll never be an effective system." 
</P>
<P>
Mertes, 60, is a 20-year veteran of California community college 
administration. He was picked for the chancellor's job in 1988 because he knew 
the system well and because of his reputation as a patient, low-key mediator. 
If anyone could weave the 107 separate two-year campuses into a coherent 
system, it was thought, Mertes could. 
</P>
<P>
But the chancellor said he has been hamstrung by state regulations and 
bureaucratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treated like a small state agency," Mertes said. "There is just no 
understanding that this small office . . . represents the largest higher 
education system in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, he said, is that a number of agencies have some say over how the 
system is run. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* The Department of Personnel Administration sets the salaries for top 
positions in the chancellor's office, and Mertes says they are not high enough 
to attract top candidates. 
</P>
<P>
* The state Department of Finance must approve any reorganization of the 
236-person central staff. 
</P>
<P>
* The Department of Personnel Administration has final say over proposals to 
move people on the central staff from one job to another. "I can't even 
transfer a secretary," Mertes said. 
</P>
<P>
* The Department of Finance must approve spending priorities that are set by 
Mertes and the system's Board of Governors for the 1.4-million-student system. 
The state agency frequently makes major changes in these spending plans, Mertes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many agree with Mertes that such actions make it virtually impossible to devise 
systemwide programs and policies. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest system to lead is the one with the most restraints," said a 
Sacramento higher education observer who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the University of California, which has constitutional autonomy, or even 
the California State University system, which operates with considerable 
independence, the community colleges have remained largely under the thumb of 
the Legislature and the state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Division of authority has been a problem ever since the systemwide Board of 
Governors and chancellor's office were established in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
There are 71 community college districts. The largest college, with an 
enrollment of 30,877, is Mt. San Antonio in Walnut; the smallest, with an 
enrollment of 1,392, is Feather River in Quincy. Each district has its own 
elected governing board, which approves academic and vocational programs, 
handles labor relations and sets general standards. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes and the Board of Governors monitor the academic and financial 
performance of each college, gather systemwide information for the governor and 
the Legislature and, most important, distribute state funds, which account for 
65% of all community college financing. However, they have relatively little 
authority and must depend heavily on persuasion to make systemwide policies 
work effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua Smith, Mertes' predecessor, left three years ago with a blast at the 
state for not giving him enough authority to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, major legislation was enacted, and signed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian, to clarify the role of the chancellor and the Board of Governors, 
provide more money for community colleges and help them with a variety of 
academic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
While local colleges benefited, Mertes said, little was done for the central 
office or the system as a whole. "What was in the bill to implement a system 
was very minimal. It was just Band-Aids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics blame Mertes for not making a successful transition from 
running a community college district (he was chancellor of the three-campus Los 
Rios district in Sacramento) to running a state agency. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot of people who know what's going on in the community colleges but 
hardly anybody who knows what goes on here," said Robert Harris, who is in 
charge of education programs in the Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
However, many others agree that Mertes faces formidable obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes is especially irritated because he has not been able to fill six top 
central office jobs that were exempted from civil service regulations by the 
1988 legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes (who makes $101,000 a year) wants to pay his chief deputy $107,888, but 
the Department of Personnel Administration has approved only $86,533. 
</P>
<P>
"Cabinet secretaries -- the top jobs in state government -- pay only a little 
more than $101,000 a year," said David Tirapelle, the department director. 
"We've been very reluctant to pay community college officials more than state 
agency heads." 
</P>
<P>
Mertes has filled top systemwide jobs with administrators temporarily imported 
from local two-year campuses, who retain their local salaries, benefits and job 
security. They stay for a year or so, then return to their home campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the Department of Finance has insisted that such 
"interjurisdictional exchanges" be terminated by the end of next year and that 
the jobs be filled on a permanent basis at salaries agreed to by the colleges 
and the Department of Personnel Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also said the Department of Finance would be glad to approve a 
reorganization plan for the chancellor's office "if he would just give us a 
plan. We ask him for a plan and we get a set of 'options.' We don't want 
options; we want to know what they plan to do, and they can't seem to make up 
their minds." Harris said he thought Mertes "had the best shot" of any of the 
people who have held the chancellor's job "of making the system work." 
</P>
<P>
Harris conceded that the Legislature and state agencies like his pay much 
closer attention to the community college systemwide office than they do to the 
University of California or the California State University and that "must be 
frustrating" to Mertes. 
</P>
<P>
It is so frustrating that Mertes next year will ask California's new governor 
and the Legislature for a "fundamental structural change" to grant more 
authority to the chancellor and Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
"This will only be a system when the priorities are set by the system office 
and not by other agencies," Mertes said.

TRAFFIC: ORANGE COUNTY VOTERS' REFUSAL TO APPROVE HIGHER TAXES HAS THWARTED ITS

<P>
One by one, Southern California counties have reluctantly stepped up to pay 
their share of the region's soaring transportation bill. All but one, that is. 
</P>
<P>
After several failed attempts, Los Angeles County voters approved a half-cent 
sales tax in 1980 and will get a chance to tack on another half-cent in 
November. In 1987, San Diego passed a tax on its first try. And Riverside and 
San Bernardino residents each voted within the last two years to tax themselves 
for new trains, highways and other transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, those taxes have established an enormous pool of funds to complete 
regional highway and rail systems. But as planners have filled in the 
transportation map, Orange County has remained conspicuously blank. Voters 
there have twice rejected transportation taxes, and a half-cent sales tax 
slated for the November ballot faces what even proponents concede will be a 
tough battle. 
</P>
<P>
That has left planners deeply frustrated, and many complain that the 
unwillingness of Orange County residents to tax themselves is blocking 
long-range plans for an effective approach to the regional problem of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do us any good if we're not working as a region," said Tek Tanaka, 
deputy transportation director of Riverside County. "If Orange County doesn't 
hurry up and get a tax, people coming down out of Riverside will go like hell 
for a couple of miles, and then just come to a stop at the county line." 
</P>
<P>
Those complaints are echoed in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino 
counties, and they have reached Orange County leaders as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sort of the Rodney Dangerfields of transportation," said Monte Ward, 
director of governmental relations for the Orange County Transportation 
Commission. "We get no respect." 
</P>
<P>
Most blame Orange County's unwillingness to approve a higher sales tax on its 
staunchly conservative population. Voters in the county, where Republicans hold 
a 55% to 35% registration edge over Democrats, have rejected every countywide 
bond measure introduced since 1957. But others are less inclined to attribute 
it entirely to ideology. San Diego County, after all, has 11% more Republicans 
than Democrats, and yet voters there handily approved a sales tax in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a Republican, conservative electorate, and they're inclined to vote 
against tax increases too," said former state Sen. Jim Mills, chairman of the 
San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Board and the leader of San Diego's 
successful sales tax campaign. "I think the reasons for Orange County's failure 
are more complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mills and other observers believe much of the blame for the defeat of 
last year's half-cent sales tax proposal in Orange County belongs to the 
proponents themselves, who put the measure up in a special election, dooming it 
to low turnout and, ultimately, failure. 
</P>
<P>
And a sizable group says the county would get its tax -- and the region its 
final transportation link -- if life just weren't quite so good in Orange 
County. According to that reasoning, voters have rejected the tax because 
transportation systems still don't strike them as bad enough to pay for fixing. 
</P>
<P>
For backers of the measure, the good news is that it gets worse all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that by November, people will be back from vacation, and traffic here 
will be a mess," said Reed Royalty, chairman of Orange County's Foundation for 
Consensus and a leader of the sales tax drive. "Then, finally, when this county 
is strangling, people might be ready to vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
Until they do, Royalty and others add, the region as a whole will pay for 
Orange County's frugality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ultimately a problem for everyone if some areas don't have the funding to 
make needed improvements," said Judy Weiss, deputy executive director of the 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. "The motorist doesn't want to 
hear that different areas have different funding structures or that some areas 
have the tax and some don't. He just wants to get to his destination." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the consequences of Orange County's inaction are confined to its own 
borders, but several highway and rail projects have implications that ripple 
into the region at large. For instance, Interstate 5, which links downtown Los 
Angeles to downtown San Diego, is scheduled for widening from the Los Angeles 
County line to San Clemente, but the project will be delayed by at least a 
decade if Orange County residents turn down the transportation tax for the 
third time. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, improvements to the congested intersection of Interstate 405 and 
Interstate 5 in Orange County have long been on the drawing board but lack 
local funds to begin them. Those improvements would be postponed indefinitely 
without the tax. 
</P>
<P>
For San Diegans commuting into Orange or Los Angeles counties -- or for Los 
Angeles residents going the other direction -- that would mean no relief from 
snarled traffic and dirty air. 
</P>
<P>
The price for Orange County's resistance to higher taxes is rapidly spreading 
north and east as well. Cheaper housing has driven scores of new residents to 
the Inland Empire, but a shortage of jobs in Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties means that 260,000 cars use the Riverside Freeway (California 91) to 
get in and out of those areas every day, some continuing on into Los Angeles 
and others breaking south toward job-rich central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, traffic in that Orange County corridor is expected to 
increase to 410,000 cars a day. "That's a hell of an increase," said Albert 
Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman. "And if Orange County doesn't do something about 
it, it's going to be quite a backup." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County has committed a portion of its sales tax to widening the 
Riverside Freeway, but Orange County so far has no money to pick up the project 
as it crosses the county line. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, commuter rail, which has been the focus of the half-cent sales tax 
that Los Angeles County approved in 1980, has lagged far behind in Orange 
County, stymieing completion of a more ambitious rail system to serve the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
While San Diego and Los Angeles each are planning to apply for state matching 
funds to improve the rail corridor that links them, Orange County has no money 
of its own to put up for the project. Without it, the Orange County stretch of 
the line would remain as is. 
</P>
<P>
New commuter lines, including one that would run from central Orange County 
into Los Angeles and another that would link Irvine with Riverside County, are 
also on hold pending passage of a local sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, fewer trains and unwidened highways inevitably translate into 
more congested traffic, a prospect that does little to endear Orange County to 
its neighbors, who would inherit their share of the increased congestion. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Orange County officials admit that their area is blocking the 
region's plans to grapple with its mushrooming traffic problem. But they argue 
that there's only so much they can do, and that ultimately, only the county's 
voters can change their own lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Taken as a whole, the freeway program and transit program in Southern 
California depends on Orange County paying its share," Ward said. "We hear the 
resentment: People are angry that we're not contributing to our share of the 
regional transportation system, but voters are, and continue to be, skeptical."

ORANGUTAN TRAINER IS AWARDED $4.2 MILLION;

<P>
VERDICT: LAS VEGAS ENTERTAINER WINS BATTLE WITH ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WHO 
ACCUSED HIM OF ABUSING ANIMALS.

<P>
Entertainer Bobby Berosini was awarded $4.2 million by a jury Saturday in his 
bitter yearlong battle with animal rights activists who accused him of beating 
orangutans used in his act on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, America," Berosini, a native of Czechoslovakia, said as he left the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll never see a penny of that money," responded Philip Hirschkop, an 
attorney for the Washington-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(PETA). Hirschkop said he would appeal the award that a state District Court 
jury handed down after three days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The animal rights organization was assessed $2 million in damages on counts of 
invasion of privacy and defamation. Jeanne Roush, an investigator for the 
group, and Ottavio Gesmundo, a former employee at the Stardust Hotel, where 
Berosini performed, were each assessed $1 million in damages on the same 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
A California nonprofit organization, Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), 
and its executive director, Pat Derby, were each assessed $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury found no malice in the actions of the defendants and issued 
verdicts precluding Berosini from collecting punitive damages. Hirschkop said 
that because the jury found defamation and invasion of privacy but no malice, 
the verdict was inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
Gesmundo videotaped scenes of Berosini striking his orangutans before they went 
on stage for performances at the Stardust Hotel in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The videotapes were then circulated to animal rights groups, including PETA and 
PAWS. Representatives of those two groups took the tapes to local and national 
media, including "Entertainment Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Berosini claimed the adverse publicity damaged his career and cost him millions 
of dollars in bookings. On the witness stand, he portrayed the orangutans, 
which he calls "his kids," as powerful animals that must be disciplined if they 
are to be kept under control. Berosini also said the primates were spooked by 
dancers in the show who made animal noises in an effort to get them to 
misbehave. 
</P>
<P>
Animal rights activists descended on Las Vegas, picketing in front of the 
Stardust and encouraging the public to pass up the show. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to headline at the Stardust and hurried from the courthouse 
Saturday, saying, "I've got to go take care of the kids. We've got to perform 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
"I was used as a pawn to make money," Berosini said of attacks by the animal 
rights groups. "They were using this as a means of fund-raising." 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Wednesday, an attorney for Berosini urged jurors to send a 
message to the animal rights movement. Attorney Tom Pitaro called on jurors to 
stop animal activists who oppose everything "from circuses to medical research 
to save babies." 
</P>
<P>
But after the verdicts came in, the national director of People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals said her group will continue its fight. "It is the duty, 
and the First Amendment right, of every animal protection organization to speak 
out against cruelty," Ingrid Newkirk said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawsuits designed to stop people from protecting animals -- and for that 
matter, children, senior citizens or anyone subject to abuse -- cannot be 
allowed to ultimately prevail."

HOW TO SPEND BILLIONS IN GAS TAX DOLLARS? OFFICIALS PONDER 7-YEAR PLAN FOR 
SOUTHLAND

<P>
From the widening of California 14 in the Antelope Valley to the construction 
of the last link of Interstate 15 in San Diego, millions of dollars in new 
highway projects for Southern California are being presented to state officials 
this week for inclusion in a master road-building plan. 
</P>
<P>
With billions of dollars in new cash from a gasoline tax increase at their 
disposal, members of the California Transportation Commission are expected to 
sift through recommendations from regional agencies representing Los Angeles, 
San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties to map out a 
new seven-year plan for easing a congestion crisis in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hathaway, the commission's deputy director for finance, said the regional 
agencies have recommended nearly twice as many projects as the state can afford 
-- forcing the commission to pick and choose among them when it officially 
adopts the State Transportation Improvement Program next month. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials said the commission is expected generally to adhere to 
priorities recommended by the regional agencies and to drop only those projects 
that local officials deem less pressing. 
</P>
<P>
The projects include proposals for widening highways, extending freeways, 
constructing sound walls, adding car-pool lanes and synchronizing traffic 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, said that in setting priorities his agency recommended projects 
that would "improve air quality, reduce accidents and improve the efficiency of 
the existing highway network." 
</P>
<P>
Of the $746 million in projects proposed by the regional commission, $206 
million would be devoted to the construction of car-pool lanes and $62 million 
to synchronize traffic signals at various locations. Car-pool lanes are 
expected to improve air quality by decreasing the number of automobiles, and 
synchronized traffic signals are designed to make traffic flow more easily. 
</P>
<P>
Under the commission proposals, car-pool lanes would be built along the San 
Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) from Normandie Avenue near Torrance to the 
Orange County line, on the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) from Baldwin 
Avenue to Puente Avenue, and along the Orange Freeway (California 57) from the 
Pomona Freeway (California 60) to the Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects given high priority by the LACTC and expected to become part of 
the state plan include a proposal for completing the expansion of California 30 
in the city of La Verne and constructing a six-lane freeway between Foothill 
Boulevard and the San Bernardino County line. 
</P>
<P>
The regional agency has also recommended widening California 14 in the Antelope 
Valley from San Fernando Road to Escondido Summit. 
</P>
<P>
Not given high priority by the LACTC is a plan to widen the Pomona Freeway from 
the Orange Freeway to the San Bernardino County line. Officials said an 
engineering glitch had forced them to give the project a low priority, but they 
expected the problem to be resolved by the time it comes up again for 
consideration in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the major projects placed before the state commission for consideration 
were promised voters when they were asked June 5 to endorse a gasoline tax 
increase. But one project that was not touted by backers of Proposition 111 -- 
the ballot measure that triggered the gas tax increase -- was the extension of 
the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710) through South Pasadena. The project is 
bitterly opposed by residents of that city. 
</P>
<P>
In its recommendations, the LACTC has asked state officials to endorse two 
projects that would begin to acquire right-of-way for the Long Beach Freeway 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Southern California, local officials also attempted to live up to 
promises made to the voters. Projects that received recommendations from San 
Diego officials included those that would complete Interstate 15 through City 
Heights and widen Interstate 5 and add car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, officials proposed the completion of California 30 
from the Los Angeles County line to Interstate 215. Orange County seeks funds 
for widening the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5).

BARRY ASKS PROSECUTOR TO DROP RETRIAL OPTION;

<P>
Mayor Marion Barry, brushing aside tears a day after a jury convicted him of a 
misdemeanor drug charge but failed to resolve 12 other charges, apologized to 
the city Saturday and called on the federal government to abandon any thoughts 
of a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
"To young and old, black and white . . . rich and poor, I ask you to forgive me 
for any hurt I may have caused," Barry, one of the nation's most prominent 
black municipal officials, told cheering supporters at a rally televised live 
throughout the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us come together to heal ourselves and our city," he said. "I call upon 
the United States government, too, to join me in this healing." 
</P>
<P>
The government's arrest of Barry on drug charges in a highly publicized sting 
operation has inflamed racial tensions in the predominantly black District of 
Columbia, where the former civil rights activist is finishing his third term as 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Some legal authorities predicted Saturday that prosecutors would indeed drop 
the unresolved drug and perjury charges against Barry, largely because a 
crucial piece of their evidence -- the FBI sting operation -- apparently proved 
offensive to many jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the jury who were willing to discuss the case said that in 
convicting Barry of one misdemeanor drug possession charge and acquitting him 
on another, they were divided on other charges and were split 6 to 6 on a 
specific drug charge arising from the FBI sting. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, in a 15-minute speech in a municipal auditorium, made no mention of any 
future political plans. But the Democratic mayor, who announced when his trial 
began that he would not seek reelection, still could run as an independent 
candidate for mayor. He also could seek election to a four-year term as an 
at-large member of the City Council, according to some political advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Citing "God's mercy, his grace and his everlasting love," Barry told his 
audience he had taken "a giant step toward healing" by spending seven weeks in 
substance abuse centers in Florida and South Carolina immediately after his 
arrest in the FBI sting last January. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was recorded by a hidden FBI video camera as he smoked crack cocaine in a 
downtown hotel room with a former girlfriend, ex-model Rasheeda Moore, who was 
cooperating with the government. The 83-minute videotape was a keystone of the 
prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
Barry thanked his supporters "for your prayers and your compassion when my 
private and personal life was paraded before the world." In an apparent 
reference to trial evidence that he had affairs with several women who used 
drugs with him, Barry said he also had asked for and received the forgiveness 
of his wife, Effi. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens' stated intention to study the question 
of a retrial for several weeks, Barry thanked jurors for their difficult 
deliberations and said: "Let their judgment be our last judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Abbe Lowell, a former Justice Department lawyer, said he doubted that Stephens 
would retry the case. "There's no reason to think he'd have any more success 
the second time around," Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Plato Cacheris, a prominent defense attorney who specializes in white-collar 
and political corruption cases, said he also considered a retrial unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the depth of feelings in this city, the Barry case probably could be 
tried to a hung jury ad infinitum," Cacheris said. "The jury apparently viewed 
the FBI sting as using an elephant gun instead of a flyswatter to get a mayor 
for a bunch of misdemeanors. This guy is no Manuel Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
Cacheris was referring to the deposed dictator of Panama, who is awaiting trial 
in a Miami jail on 11 counts of international drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Johnnie Mae Hardeman told reporters the jury was evenly split on the 
charge relating to the FBI sting, an allegation that Barry possessed cocaine 
last Jan. 18. She said many jurors felt he had been "singled out" for 
prosecution by the government, and they doubted the truthfulness and motives of 
Barry's chief accusers, who themselves were drug users. 
</P>
<P>
A former prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office, who requested anonymity, 
agreed that Barry probably would not be retried. He said the sting operation 
"seemed a little too much for misdemeanor drug possession," adding: 
</P>
<P>
"When a jury is split that much, and where you don't think it's an aberration, 
it's tough to retry a case and get better results." 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking federal law enforcement official, who also requested anonymity, 
said that in sting operations "you always have to be worried about the totality 
of the circumstances, how a jury is going to view it." 
</P>
<P>
Although the sting was not entrapment, "there was an appearance that the 
government was bending over backward to get Marion Barry more than it would an 
average person," the official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Other lawyers reached for comment said Stephens was likely to consider the 
divisive impact that another trial would have on residents of the District of 
Columbia, a factor that would weigh against retrying Barry.

Downpours drenched the Northeast with as much as an inch of rain an hour 
Saturday, forcing the evacuation of 400 people from swamped New Hampshire 
campgrounds, as storms raked Kansas with 70-m.p.h. gusts. 
</P>
<P>
Flood watches were posted in parts of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine as heavy rain drove small rivers and 
streams over their banks, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The driving rains caused street flooding and ponding in poor-drainage areas. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters in Vermont said mudslides were possible as the ground turned spongy 
across much of the state. 
</P>
<P>
More than four inches of rain inundated Clayville, R.I., in four hours Saturday 
morning, and more than five inches were reported in parts of New England since 
Friday. Bristol, N.H., which received more than three inches of rain in 24 
hours, has been saturated with 10.8 inches in a week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In New Hampshire, authorities evacuated 400 campers from sites in Ossipee, 
Conway and Bartlett. The campers were given shelter at town halls and in 
service clubs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious flooding was along New Hampshire's Pemigewasset River, which 
swept over its banks Saturday, the weather service's River Forecast Center in 
Bloomfield, Conn., reported. 
</P>
<P>
In the Great Plains, an early morning storm with 70-m.p.h. wind gusts roared 
through the central Kansas town of Hays, tearing limbs from trees. 
</P>
<P>
Severe thunderstorm watches were posted in much of north-central and central 
Kansas as heavy rain fell in Ellsworth, Saline and McPherson counties.

EAST MEETS WEST AS 4 GERMAN PARTIES DECIDE ON MERGER;

<TEXT>
<P>
The Free Democrats on Saturday merged with three centrist parties of East 
Germany to form the first party representing all of Germany. All-German 
elections are slated for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
At a special congress in Hanover, the FDP, political base of Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, was united with the East German Free Democrats, the 
Federation of Free Democrats and the German Forum Party. 
</P>
<P>
The new party is called FDP-The Liberals. Outgoing West German FDP Chairman 
Otto Graf Lambsdorff, 63, was elected to head the combined all-German party. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration adopted at the congress, the new party declared that it aims 
"to fill German unity with a liberal spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The West German FDP is a junior partner in the Christian Democratic Union-led 
coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FDP seldom gained more than 7% of the votes in West German 
elections, it has played a crucial role in helping the majority party form a 
coalition. The FDP has been allied with both the Social Democratic Party and 
Kohl's CDU. 
</P>
<P>
The CDU and the opposition SPD also intend to merge with their East German 
sister parties in September. 
</P>
<P>
The combined parties will face their first test on Oct. 14, when elections are 
held in the five states East Germany will form before it politically rejoins 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing support in Bonn and East Berlin for having German unification 
take place on the day of the state elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democratic Party, led by Kohl in West Germany and Prime Minister 
Lothar de Maiziere in East Germany, both favor unification and all-German 
elections on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democrats, the second-largest party in both countries, 
want unification in September and elections in December, in the hope that a 
later elections date might railroad Kohl's quest to head a united Germany and 
improve their election chances. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats favor unification as early as possible, but contend that 
Kohl wants early elections to avoid the political repercussions of a growing 
economic crisis in East Germany.

The National Geographic Society is anticipating a reunited Germany and a 
decentralized Soviet Union in its new world atlas, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth edition of the National Geographic Atlas of The World will lack the 
red line that separated the two Germanys in past editions, and refer to only 
one Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to look into our crystal ball and see that the unification of 
Germany is inevitable," said John B. Garver, National Geographic's chief 
cartographer. 
</P>
<P>
The atlas will show both Bonn and Berlin as capitals, but only the West German 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Hand Fallon, speaking for the society, said that National Geographic's 
first atlas since 1981 will drop "S.S.R.," for Soviet Socialist Republic, from 
all Soviet states except Russia, to reflect independence impulses within the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the atlas, the Middle East map will be flagged with the notation: "On 
Aug. 2, 1990, Iraqi military forces invaded Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
The new edition of 240,000 copies is to be released in November.

OFFICIALS CONFIRM MARINES HAVE LEFT FOR MIDDLE EAST; 
</P>
<P>
DEPLOYMENT: UNITS FROM FOUR CALIFORNIA BASES HAVE BEEN SENT TO EMBARKATION 
POINTS. TOTALS ARE UNKNOWN.

<P>
U.S. Marines from at least four bases in California have left for the Middle 
East, officials confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Units from the 1st Marine Division and 1st Force Service Support Group at Camp 
Pendleton, the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing in El Toro, and the 7th Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade in Twentynine Palms have been sent to embarkation points 
for deployment to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield, said 
Capt. Rose-Ann Sgrignoli, a spokeswoman at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gene Browne, an El Toro base spokesman, added that Marines from the Tustin 
base have also been deployed from Orange County to embarkation points, "but 
beyond that we really can't say." 
</P>
<P>
Sgrignoli would not say how many troops had left or when they had gone. She 
also did not say where the "embarkation points" are or whether the troops will 
fly or sail to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
However, wives of Marines from Twentynine Palms identified the "embarkation 
point" as Norton Air Force Base, just east of San Bernardino, and said most 
Marines had left by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been planning this all week," said Laura Redlin, whose husband, Col. 
Robert Redlin, is a logistics officer with the 7th Marine Expeditionary 
Brigade, based at Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen my husband at all except last night before he left," added 
Redlin, who said her husband left Saturday morning for the Norton base. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of action here, going on all day and all night," said Kenneth C. 
McFarland, a disabled veteran who lives in Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland said he has seen large buses leaving the base with men inside. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some coming but more leaving," he said. "It's about three times the 
normal activity." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl French, a 30-year resident of Twentynine Palms, said she lives near a 
side exit to the base that the troops have been using "all night and all day 
for the past few days." 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to seeing convoys coming in and out occasionally, but nothing like 
this," said French. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Marines left the base in a convoy on a back road. One resident, 
who lives on that road, said the convoy took 20 minutes to pass by. 
</P>
<P>
Twentynine Palms runs a three-week training program for Marines, acquainting 
them with combat conditions in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
A wire service report quoted unnamed Bush Administration officials as saying 
that 4,000 Marines from Twentynine Palms were on their way to the Middle East. 
On Friday, residents around El Toro noticed an increase in aircraft noise at 
the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station there. 
</P>
<P>
At Camp Pendleton, civilian and military sources say the level of activity 
there in the last few days hasn't been seen since the U.S. involvement in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the troops from the three Marine bases, units from the Army 
101st Airborne Division in Ft. Campbell, Ky., have started making their way to 
an embarkation point, said Lt. Ronald Sharp, a spokesman at Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
Already in the Middle East, Sharp said, are units from the Army 82nd Airborne 
Division based at Fort Bragg, N.C., a squadron from Shaw Air Force Base in 
South Carolina and transport aircraft from Pope Air Force Base in North 
Carolina.

INTERNATIONAL ACTION A FIRST THIS CENTURY

<P>
When President Bush decided to halt trade with Iraq as its troops were spilling 
into Kuwait on the morning Aug. 2, it was the opening move in a strategic 
contest in which the rules, the stakes and the other players were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
In a world increasingly focused on protecting local and regional interests, the 
United States risked being the only player willing to bid decisively against 
Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
But country by country, the rest of the world has largely fallen in behind the 
United States. And for the first time in this century, collective international 
action among normally fractious countries and regions is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
The first countries to follow the U.S. lead were allies Britain and France, 
which quickly agreed to freeze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets. The U.N. Security 
Council added its support by approving a resolution that sharply condemned the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important collective body in the Arab world, the Arab League, 
hesitated. Meeting in an emergency session the day after the invasion, the 
league adjourned without reaching a consensus. Without Arab support, one 
Security Council member said, further U.N. action was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the European Community agreed to boycott Iraqi oil, despite the 
hardship it would cause for some of its 12 members. Italy and Spain in 
particular had just fought long battles against inflation, and the prospect of 
rising oil prices was sure to squeeze their fragile economies. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Italy, currently chairing the European Community, that made the 
European announcement. "We will not be satisfied until there is not a single 
Iraqi soldier in Kuwait," an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, heavily dependent on oil from the Persian Gulf, resisted U.S. pressure 
for days but finally gave in after a phone call from President Bush, agreeing 
to join the boycott against Iraqi oil. Even China, whose repression of 
pro-democracy demonstrations last year had damaged its international standing, 
decided to halt arms shipments to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The situation evolved dramatically again last Monday. For only the second time 
in its history, the U.N. Security Council adopted a comprehensive trade 
embargo. Individual moves by separate players suddenly became a phalanx of 
opposition to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Even Turkey and Brazil -- faced with severe economic losses from the embargo, 
climbed aboard. It was not, however, a unanimous stance. Two Security Council 
members, Cuba and Yemen, abstained from the vote, signaling their opposition to 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq no doubt was stunned as the Soviet Union, once a staunch ally and its 
largest arms supplier, joined in the Security Council vote. For the first time 
since World War II, the four main wartime Allies were acting in concert. The 
next day, several OPEC countries announced they would boost oil production to 
compensate for embargoed oil from Iraq and Kuwait, mitigating the potential 
economic damage to oil importing countries. The Arab League, however, remained 
divided. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. troops were deployed to Saudi Arabia, and U.S. naval vessels 
took up positions south of the Persian Gulf and in the eastern Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was once again moving ahead of the pack. The decision to 
organize for a possible blockade went beyond the terms of the U.N. embargo. It 
was crucial that other countries join the effort, or the United States might 
appear to be overly aggressive. Only Britain immediately offered to join the 
force, adding some ships and planes. Other members of the European Community 
and NATO were biding their time. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League, meeting in Cairo at another emergency summit, was still 
divided, despite efforts of Saudi King Fahd and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak 
to forge a pan-Arab military alliance under the banner of the league. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, that deadlock was broken. Twelve of the league's 21 members voted to 
recommend that troops be sent to take part in the defense of Saudi Arabia and 
any other threatened nation in the Persian Gulf region. Although six members 
abstained or were absent, only two, Libya and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, voted against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This appears to be the final break," said a Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, Australia, Canada and West Germany ordered ships to the region to 
participate in a possible naval blockade. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Bush Administration signaled its satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States welcomes the participation of so many countries in our joint 
efforts to fight aggression of Saddam Hussein," said White House spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater. "We expect others to join this group as well."

WILLING TO BLOCKADE IRAQ TO STOP ANY OIL SHIPMENT, BUSH SAYS;

SANCTIONS: BUT THE PRESIDENT REPORTS THAT THE U.N. EMBARGO HAS VIRTUALLY HALTED 
WORLD TRADE WITH BAGHDAD.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said Saturday that he would be willing to order a naval blockade 
of Iraq, while noting that world trade with the Middle East aggressor has come 
to a virtual halt already because of the embargo approved by the U.N. Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of one small tanker, I believe it was, no vessels from Iraq 
or Kuwaiti ports are trying to get out of there with cargo, with oil cargo," 
the President said, adding: "No shipping from Iraq is coming through the Strait 
of Hormuz." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a decision had been made to impose a trade quarantine, Bush 
replied: "I've made the decision in principle, and I think most other leaders 
have, that the sanctions will be fully enforced and that exports from Iraq will 
not get into the market. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want to do is see that no oil comes out through the Strait of Hormuz. 
And if it requires naval vessels to see that that happens, fine." he said. The 
strait is a narrow stretch of water leading from the Persian Gulf, on which 
Iraq has its only deep-water port, to the oceans of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. military presence in the Middle East continued to grow, 
with a contingent of Marines dispatched from Camp Pendleton and other troops 
from Ft. Campbell, Ky. The Pentagon said the units are equipped with missiles 
and other sophisticated weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In Kennebunkport on the first full day of his summer vacation, the President 
engaged in personal diplomacy to encourage international participation in the 
military effort to prevent Iraq from launching an invasion of Saudi Arabia from 
its position in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush telephoned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and 
the leaders of Bahrain and Qatar to discuss the Middle East crisis and the 
international campaign to isolate Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of U.S. policy in the region are to use a multinational military 
force to keep Iraq from attacking Saudi Arabia while relying on the trade 
embargo to pressure Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that no Iraqi oil is leaving 
Turkey or Saudi Arabia. A Turkish oil terminal on the Mediterranean Sea and a 
Saudi terminal on the Red Sea are key transit points for 90% of Iraq's oil 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Bush used extreme caution in discussing whether he would like to see Hussein 
overthrown from within. Officials have said privately that such a move by 
disaffected Iraqis is the underlying goal of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not prepared to support the overthrow," Bush said. But, referring to a 
policy intended to force the withdrawal of invading Iraqi troops from Kuwait, 
the President also said: "Whatever it takes to have our objectives met is what 
should take place." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked if his objective includes overthrowing Hussein. "I'll just leave 
it sit out there and everybody can figure it out," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
The President spoke to reporters from the back porch of his vacation home. He 
was joined at his home by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and 
several deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The advisers gathered to review with Bush the secretary of state's trip to 
Turkey and Brussels, where Baker met with NATO foreign ministers, and to 
examine potential naval operations near the Turkish and Saudi ports through 
which the bulk of Iraqi oil is shipped. 
</P>
<P>
The President is backing up his policy with a rapid deployment of troops from 
the United States to the tense region. U.S. Army airborne and mechanized 
brigades, Air Force F-15 fighter jets, three U.S. Navy aircraft carrier battle 
groups and a large contingent of Marines have either arrived in the Middle East 
or are on their way in air and sea lifts. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters asked Bush if he considers it likely that Iraqi citizens will rise up 
against Hussein. The President replied: 
</P>
<P>
"That sometimes happens when leaders get so out of touch with reality that they 
commit their country to outrageous acts. That does happen. And I know that some 
countries around the world are hoping that that will happen in this situation. 
But we'll wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed later on the same point, Bush said he hopes that international action 
will produce "an Iraq that is prepared to live peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
"If that means Saddam Hussein changes his spots, so be it. And if he doesn't, I 
hope the Iraqi people do something about it so that their leader will live by 
the norms of international behavior that will be acceptable to other nations," 
the President said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration continued to refrain from describing as hostages about 3,500 
Americans in Kuwait and Iraq who have not been permitted to leave the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that calling them hostages would only inflame the 
situation, increasing their potential "value" to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been demanded or asked in connection with permitting them to leave 
the country," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, no American citizens have as yet been mistreated," he 
added, noting, however, that the situation runs "against all international 
norms." 
</P>
<P>
Bush declined to discuss the ultimate size of the U.S. force being sent to 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's reports of an initial deployment of about 4,000 was quickly 
eclipsed by unofficial estimates of 50,000 and then 90,000. At least one report 
subsequently has estimated the possible eventual total as high as 250,000 
troops if Iraq invades Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the Administration would not provide "any numbers on troop 
strength for obvious national security reasons." 
</P>
<P>
While such reports could encourage Iraq to strike before the forces grow any 
larger, officials said, the unofficial figures also serve as a warning to 
Hussein that the United States is willing to pour considerable resources into 
the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, Bush mixed work with recreation, sandwiching the 90-minute 
meeting with his advisers between a morning ride on his speedboat Fidelity and 
an afternoon on the Cape Arundel golf course. 
</P>
<P>
On the golf course, Bush told reporters he might make several trips back to 
Washington during his vacation. At least one, next Wednesday, is already 
scheduled to allow him to meet with officials for an update on the Iraq 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The President stressed that "there's still room for more diplomacy" in the 
effort to persuade Iraq's Hussein to step back from Kuwait. He called attention 
to the the resolution adopted Friday by a majority of the members of the Arab 
League, recommending that Arab nations commit military forces to the defense of 
Saudi Arabia and any other threatened states in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Hussein) does see today more clearly than he saw yesterday at this 
time that the world is united against him," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also expressed confidence that excess capacity within the oil industry 
would allow the international oil market to remain stable despite the 
disruption of exports from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Fitzwater praised Venezuela and Iran for pledging to 
make up any oil shortfalls and said that as a result of high oil stocks in the 
United States, "America is in a very positive situation in terms of its ability 
to withstand existing oil disruptions." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the "military participation" offered by Canada, Australia, West 
Germany, France, Belgium and Britain "signal a high degree of unity."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With communications blacked out, the anguish of occupied Kuwait seeps out only 
in small bits of diplomatic intelligence, refugee accounts and rare press 
reports. The assembled portrait is grim. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's military machine, a force estimated at 120,000 in Kuwait, has the 
country in an iron grip. But wild ill-discipline among the ranks has terrorized 
the populace and washed Saddam Hussein's vaunted army with a dark stain. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports, and discounting rumor and hearsay, the occupation has 
been marked by unprovoked killings, rapes and wanton looting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an invasion," said a Kuwait oil-company worker who fled that 
country to Saudi Arabia. "This is a bank robbery." 
</P>
<P>
"These aren't soldiers, they're pirates," he told a reporter in Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
The supposedly well-trained Iraqi soldiers have rampaged through Kuwait's 
glittering, air-conditioned shopping malls, smashing windows and carting off 
merchandise, according to refugees who escaped to Jordan over the last few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no security at all," a Lebanese named Walid Khodr Shaker told a 
Reuters news agency correspondent at the Jordanian border. "Many shops have 
been looted, especially jewelry shops and car showrooms. The place has fallen 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Philippines President Corazon Aquino has expressed alarm over 
reports that Philippine maids have been raped by the invaders. She gave no 
details, but Alice de Ocampo, a governess who fled through Saudi Arabia, told 
reporters on arrival in Manila that "many Filipinas are being raped there." 
</P>
<P>
Her account was supported by reports from two other refugees, a South Korean 
and a Kuwaiti. The Kuwaiti, speaking to reporters in Geneva, said three 
soldiers had demanded food at the house of one of his relatives. "After they 
ate," he related, "they said, 'Give us your maids.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait oil-company workers said that the Iraqi soldiers are young and that 
many appear to be rural boys. To be dropped from a dirt-poor Iraqi village into 
the riches of modern Kuwait presents mind-boggling temptations. 
</P>
<P>
Many refugees say their passage out was assured only because the soldiers could 
be bribed. One Philippine woman said she and her friends put bottled water, 
reported in short supply among the Iraqi troops, into their luggage. The 
soldiers took the water and waved them through the checkpoint on a road to 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Betts, the American coach of the Kuwaiti national swimming team, was 
stopped at a checkpoint on the road to the Saudi border. He told a Cable News 
Network reported on arrival in Washington that a soldier had leveled his rifle. 
Betts reached down and presented a can of cola. 
</P>
<P>
"His face lights up," Betts recounted. "He goes for the Diet Pepsi, I go for 
the border." 
</P>
<P>
Accounts of killing continued to surface outside the occupied territory. In the 
first few days of the invasion, the number of Kuwaitis killed and wounded was 
put at 800, according to diplomatic estimates and reports from the self-exiled 
Kuwaiti government. Since then an undetermined number of anti-Iraqi protesters 
have reportedly been killed during demonstrations in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti identifying himself as a resistance fighter, reached by telephone 
Friday at the Saudi border town of Khafji, reported that three Kuwaitis had 
been shot down during a protest in the capital's Jabriya district. 
</P>
<P>
The clandestine radio of the resistance, which had been off the air for four 
days, was back in operation and claimed that sabotage operations against the 
Iraqi occupiers were continuing. In a message monitored by the British 
Broadcasting Corp., the underground radio asked the Iraqis: "Look around you. 
Who are you fighting, terrorizing? Children, women, elderly and young people." 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti oil worker, who said the sheikdom's citizens were banned by law 
from owning rifles, claimed that the Iraqis were swapping their own for 
television sets and cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Those boys don't know the value of their weapons," said another Kuwaiti in Abu 
Dhabi, a physician who cut short a vacation to West Germany to return to the 
gulf. "They're not soldiers. What are they going to do, point their new TV sets 
at someone and fire?" 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis in the Abu Dhabi Hotel have set up a rumor-control committee to sort 
out the reports coming out of their country. Lacking a direct line to Kuwait, 
they have only the accounts of the latest refugees, which are canvassed for 
news of various neighborhoods where the families of vacationers caught out of 
the country and business executives live. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the reports of violence and abuse, they are collecting eyewitness 
accounts on day-to-day life under the occupation. As of Friday, the refugees 
reported that food supplies are tightening but that most Kuwaiti families are 
fairly well stocked. According to the accounts, many Kuwaitis loaded up on 
canned and packaged goods in the first days of the invasion.

URBAN REVOLT: AS WATTS MARKS 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIOLENCE, SOME BLACKS SAY 
THEY WERE GLAD THEY PARTICIPATED; OTHERS NOTE THAT PROBLEMS PREVALENT IN '65 
STILL EXIST.

Call it insight to riot. 
</P>
<P>
Standing amid a row of merchants' tents set up at the Watts Festival on 
Saturday, Tommy Jacquette grinned and spoke proudly of the carnage and flames 
and gunfire that 25 years ago engulfed the south Los Angeles community he calls 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a revolt, a rebellion against racism," explained Jacquette, 
reprimanding a man who had referred to the 1965 upheaval as a riot. "I 
participated 100%, and I'm proud of it. If America isn't ashamed of racism and 
oppression of black people, then blacks shouldn't be ashamed of participating 
in a revolt against racism and oppression." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk was not uncommon Saturday. As African-Americans throughout the city 
marked the 25th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots -- which started after the 
arrest of a Watts man -- conversations were rife with fond reflections on the 
black rage that for six days had shaken the city. 
</P>
<P>
All over South Los Angeles, members of the African-American community gathered 
in homes, at community centers and around cultural landmarks to explore the 
impact and implications of the riot that became the precursor to the urban 
revolts that swept the nation during the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not just rebelling against white people and their system," said Father 
Amdetsion, a poet and community priest who joined about 200 people at the 
"Watts '65" symposium at the Southern California Library for Social Studies and 
Research in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We were rebelling against our parents and all the other people among us who 
had said that (blacks) were nothing," Amdetsion said. "We were the generation 
who said, 'I'm black, and I'm proud of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
For many, Amdetsion and others at the symposiums said, the riots are seen as 
tools that activists tried to use to raze and redo America's social landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a real sense that 'Now we can do something; now we can be in control 
of our lives,' " said Earl Ofari Hutchinson, publisher of Impact! Publications 
and a moderator at the library forum. "The fear factor -- fear of the police 
and of the merchants -- was gone." 
</P>
<P>
But while many looked back on the revolt with nostalgia and a smidgen of 
romance, others remembered the period with a mixture of regret, fear and anger. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Harold Charlot and his wife, Helen, recalled the upheaval as a sad 
aberration from a history of serenity in their South Los Angeles neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shame," said Harold Charlot, who lives with his wife mere yards from 
the intersection of 116th Street and Avalon Boulevard -- where the riots 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"There were not many jobs around for a lot of blacks. People were sitting 
around idle and frustrated. When you go looking for a job and can't find one, 
you get mad. Sooner or later you reach a breaking point." 
</P>
<P>
The breaking point for Los Angeles' black community came shortly before 7:30 
p.m. on Aug. 11, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer Lee Minikus pulled 
over 21-year-old Marquette Frye on suspicion of drunk driving. As Minikus 
questioned Frye and put him through a battery of sobriety tests, a crowd 
gathered to watch. 
</P>
<P>
After the test, the officer determined that Frye was legally drunk and prepared 
to arrest him. But an argument broke out between Frye and Minikus, who had been 
joined by other CHP officers. The argument turned into a scuffle between Frye 
and the officers, who beat the Watts man. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged at the beating, the crowd closed in on the officers, and someone spit 
on one of the patrolmen. The officer blamed a nearby woman -- who was wearing a 
barber's smock that had mistakenly led those in the crowd to think her pregnant 
-- and tried to arrest her. 
</P>
<P>
Further outraged by what they figured was the manhandling of a pregnant woman, 
the crowd reacted violently. They threw bottles and rocks, and soon the 
violence escalated to looting and the burning of stores and cars. 
</P>
<P>
From Aug. 11 to Aug. 16, South Los Angeles burned. In an effort to contain the 
violence and eventually restore order, the National Guard and the Los Angeles 
Police Department cordoned off a 43-square-mile area of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although the upheaval is often called the Watts Riots, said black activists 
Saturday, it didn't actually reach Watts until the third day. 
</P>
<P>
When the violence finally ended, government officials said 34 people had died, 
1,032 were hurt and another 3,952 were arrested. In addition, about $40 million 
in property was destroyed or damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Whites couldn't come into this area without being attacked," said Charlot, 69. 
"I remember seeing a white man running down the street, being chased by four 
blacks. He tried to hide up under a white Mercury, but they pulled him out from 
under it and started kicking him and hitting him." 
</P>
<P>
Charlot said he and his wife pulled the man out of the crowd and led him to 
their home. There, they tended to his wounds and gave him fresh clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember trying to get a policeman to take him to the hospital," said 
Charlot. "The guy (the officer) didn't know he was white, so he said, 'You 
people started this; you take him to the hospital.' Those were the type of 
attitudes you had then." 
</P>
<P>
Many blacks contended Saturday that such attitudes -- as well as the Third 
World-type social conditions that were at the root of the riots -- remain as 
widespread as they were a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues of police abuse, educational neglect, welfareism -- all of those 
issues still exist," said Hutchinson, speaking at the forum at the social 
studies library. "If anything, they have probably gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
But though the conditions persist, said many of the community activists, the 
community's collective will to protest them has been sapped by drugs and gangs. 
In addition, they said, the black community has suffered what Hutchinson refers 
to as a "brain and resource drain." 
</P>
<P>
"What happened was that many of the poor people were left behind as many blacks 
from the community and from the movement of the '60s joined the middle class," 
Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he and other activists said Saturday, the black community in Los 
Angeles has been left with a diminished sense of unity and direction. There is 
little chance, many said, of a repeat of the 1965 upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be another riot," Hutchinson said. "The community is 
just too divided. I'm no prognosticator, but I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Some African-Americans disagreed, though. They said that the rage of the 1960s 
may again boil over -- and sooner than many political and social pundits think. 
</P>
<P>
"Plenty of people would come out (for a riot), because plenty of black people 
are still angry," said Jacquette, tapping a foot to the beat of a reggae song 
booming from a loudspeaker at the festival. "I know I would be right there in 
the middle of it. I would be with it 100% -- and, yes, I would be proud to 
participate."

LATINOS TRY TO SETTLE ON CONSENSUS CANDIDATE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: COMMUNITY LEADERS HOPE TO AVOID DIVISIVE AND EXPENSIVE CONFRONTATION 
IN THE 1ST DISTRICT. SOME DOUBT POLITICAL AMBITIONS CAN BE SET ASIDE. 
</P>

<P>
Though a federal appeals court has stayed creation of a new Latino-majority 
supervisorial district in Los Angeles County, community leaders remain locked 
in talks to determine a unity candidate who could become the first Latino on 
the powerful Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The political stakes are so high and the seat so important to the Eastside 
community that at least four prominent Democratic elected officials and one 
Republican activist are busily campaigning behind the scenes to be the Latino 
candidate for the newly created 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The unity that Latino community leaders, especially Democrats, had hoped for 
two weeks ago when a lower federal court drew new district lines and set a 
special election is apparently slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
Four Democrats are actively competing: Los Angeles City Council members Richard 
Alatorre, 44, and Gloria Molina, 41, and U.S. Reps. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los 
Angeles), 77, and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), 60. Also seeking support in 
the Latino community is Republican and former supervisorial aide Sarah Flores, 
52. 
</P>
<P>
A showdown among any of these Latino politicians is exactly the kind of 
divisive and expensive confrontation that community leaders had talked of when 
the lower court redrew all the districts to consolidate the Latino community. 
Latinos now comprise 51% of the voters and 71% of the population in the new 1st 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that once the dust settles, there is a meeting of the community 
leadership . . . and there is a consensus candidate," said Antonia Hernandez, 
president and general counsel of Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
But Vivien Bonzo of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. said, "It's an awfully 
important seat, and every Latino politician has the right to go for it. . . . 
That's old- fashioned American competition." 
</P>
<P>
Though Flores is the only announced candidate in the race, Bonzo cautioned, 
"Don't count any of them out." 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty created by so many candidates was multiplied Thursday by the 
stay issued by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the landmark voting 
rights case. 
</P>
<P>
The county has appealed the ruling of U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who 
found that the Board of Supervisors intentionally discriminated against 
Latinos, diluting their voting power by splitting the community among three 
supervisorial districts. Kenyon on Aug. 4 threw out the results of the June 
election in the 1st District, redrew the districts and ordered a new election 
for Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court will decide this week whether to extend its stay beyond 
Saturday, and a three-judge panel will rule on the case after hearing oral 
arguments in October. 
</P>
<P>
Community activists remained confident that the appeals court will uphold 
Kenyon and that there will be a Latino on the board this year. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sanchez, president of the Mexican American Grocers Assn., says a unity 
candidate is unlikely. "It doesn't happen in other communities, and I don't 
think it's going to happen here," said Sanchez. "If the political bug has bit 
them, there's no turning back." 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with candidates and community leaders indicate that there will 
likely be at least two and as many as four candidates -- should the appeals 
court uphold the new election. 
</P>
<P>
Though numerous factors such as campaign fund-raising ability are key factors, 
the lineup could be determined largely by Roybal -- the political patriarch of 
the Eastside community. 
</P>
<P>
If Roybal decides to run, he would be seeking the same office that supporters 
say was stolen from him in a controversial 1958 election. A mysterious 12,000 
votes were found in a recount several days after balloting in that 
supervisorial race, turning Roybal's slim victory into a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal went on to become one of the nation's first Latino congressmen, but the 
county election has been an open wound for him and the community ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The episode played an important role in Kenyon's finding that there has been a 
pattern of intentional discrimination against Latinos by the county board. 
</P>
<P>
Running against Roybal "would be like running against Mother Teresa," lamented 
one Alatorre loyalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think most people would have too much respect for Roybal" to oppose 
him, said Bonzo. "But ambition runs high and confidence runs high. And that may 
overcome their deference. . . . Especially if they have (campaign) money in the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
Roybal, in an interview, stressed the need for a consensus candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be interested in running unless that took place . . . and I'm 
interested only if no one else can do it," said Roybal. "This has to be done 
using intelligence instead of ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Roybal said a united front must be presented to defeat Republican Flores or her 
former boss, conservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum -- who said last week that 
running in the 1st District is a "serious option." 
</P>
<P>
Flores came in first in the June primary and was scheduled to face Superior 
Court Judge Gregory O'Brien in a November runoff. O'Brien has said that he does 
not intend to run in the new district. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unity talk, Alatorre said, "I expect to be a candidate" regardless 
of who else is running. "The likelihood of having just one candidate is not 
great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she has a great deal of respect for Roybal, but will run regardless 
of his plans. "He came close once before, and he'll come close again -- because 
I'm going to win," said Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she would not oppose Roybal. "He is the one person I would step 
aside for," said Molina. "He has the capability of uniting all Latinos" in the 
district, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But if Roybal does not run, Molina said she expects to be a candidate. Until a 
decision is reached, Molina said, "I'm operating as though there will be an 
election and that I am one of the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the posturing, most candidates are hopeful that a consensus can be 
reached and more meetings are scheduled for this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to avoid a blood bath," Torres said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
While each candidate professes a need to agree on a consensus candidate, they 
all want to be that candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, for instance, is keeping his options open. The four-term congressman, 
who is already on the ballot for reelection to Congress, last week sought and 
received an opinion from the California secretary of state that would allow him 
to also run for supervisor. The California Constitution normally prohibits 
running for more than one office in any election. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling would also pave the way for Roybal, who is running for his 15th term 
in the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that if a consensus candidate cannot be agreed on, she hopes the 
leadership can arrive "at least at some general understanding of how the 
campaign should be conducted." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision has spawned "a lot of optimism, a feeling of hope in the 
community," Hernandez said. "It's had a phenomenal impact. I want to carry that 
forward" with a positive campaign for the supervisorial seat -- and in the race 
to fill any position vacated by the eventual winner.

LURING OFFENDERS FROM A LIFE OF CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
REHABILITATION: NOVEL PROGRAM SENDS YOUTHS ON DEEP-SEA FISHING TRIP. 
COMMISSIONER WHO SENTENCED THEM HELPS THEM BAIT THEIR POLES AND OFFERS ADVICE.

<P>
"Hookup!" shouted a deckhand as he saw a fishing pole suddenly bend to the 
accompanying wail of a saltwater reel. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish on!" yelled skipper Ted Cohen as fishermen scrambled along the stern of 
the "Champagne Wishes" and cleared the way for the teen-ager who was reeling 
furiously and grimacing noticeably as the others cheered him on. 
</P>
<P>
The battle Saturday in waters off the Long Beach Harbor was between a 
seven-pound yellowtail and a 16-year-old who was there because he is a juvenile 
offender fighting his way back from a criminal conviction for auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never caught a fish this big before," said the smiling youth after 
landing his prized catch. "I've never been on a boat like this." 
</P>
<P>
For Kenya, a Long Beach teen-ager, and eight other boys placed on probation by 
the juvenile court, Saturday's fishing trip was a rare adventure and novice 
attempt by a Los Angeles County Superior Court commissioner to introduce the 
youths to a deep-sea experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a new experience for many of them, different than what 
they see all day long on the streets," said Commissioner Robert B. Axel, who 
had sentenced some of these teen-agers in his Long Beach courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get them out here like this, they're just kids, no different than any 
other kid anywhere," he said. "The problem they have is on the streets, and we 
want to help change that." 
</P>
<P>
Axel, a 16-year veteran of the juvenile court system and a member of the 
Huntington Harbor Yacht Club, said several of his fellow members 
enthusiastically volunteered their boats for the youths -- including some gang 
members -- who have been placed on probation or sent to counseling sessions by 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Targeting juvenile delinquents who appeared to show promise or effort in 
changing their ways, Axel purchased rods and reels to give to the youths and 
received donations from a local sporting goods company and hardware store for 
his venture. The commissioner invited local probation officers and counselors 
to select the youths who would go on the fishing trip and specifically asked 
them to include youths he had sentenced. 
</P>

One of those teen-agers was Ethen, a sandy-haired 16-year-old who had been 
placed on probation for vandalizing a telephone booth with graffiti and being 
found with cans of spray paint. It was Axel who sentenced him to six months' 
probation, the youth said, and he was apprehensive about meeting the 
commissioner again. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was going to be boring going out with the judge and your 
probation officer and counselors, like being with a bunch of nerds," he said. 
"But it was fun, and I even caught dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Kenya said he also had doubts about the trip, especially when he experienced 
the first rush of sea sickness as the boat left the dock. But the soft-spoken 
youth, sporting a heart-shaped stud and second earring and his Air Jordan 
basketball shoes, said he forgot his discomfort when his yellowtail catch 
became the first strike of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, the teen-agers had ice chests full of mackerel, yellowtail, sea 
bass and barracuda. Still, some of the novice fishermen also managed to snare 
each other's lines, snag a bait net and hook onto two neighboring boats that 
sped away -- with hook, line and sinker. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Shapiro, a probation officer who accompanied some of the youths, said she 
was impressed with the program that Axel is hoping to make an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was worthwhile because they were taken out of their neighborhoods," 
she said. "They were on with other kids and they were able to see nature." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, two of the boats carrying the youths nearly brushed 
together as their anchors became entangled. Shapiro said a collision was 
averted when the boys assisted one another. 
</P>
<P>
"They learned to help each other, one kid was pushing and the other was working 
with him (to free the boats)," she said. "It was a very positive experience." 
</P>
<P>
For Shapiro and several other adults, as well as a few teen-agers, the day's 
only drawback was sea sickness. 
</P>
<P>
Alex, a 14-year-old from Long Beach, was victimized by a queasy stomach and 
soon abandoned his fishing spot, largely ignoring the shouts of excitement as 
the fish were hauled in by the others. Instead, he spent most of the six-hour 
trip sitting on the bow, shielded by his Miami Dolphins hat and black jacket or 
lying down trying to overcome his nausea. 
</P>
<P>
But he remained enthusiastic about the fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the teen-ager said he had been caught riding in a car stolen 
by another person and was placed on six months' probation. The juvenile court 
commissioner who sentenced him was the same man who had invited him aboard and 
now stood nearby baiting hooks and coaching the basics of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Alex said he had no animosity toward the commissioner or any regrets about 
coming on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It kept me off the streets today," he said. "That's where you get in trouble 
sometime. I'm not in trouble today."

SMITH, STOKLOS WIN VOLLEYBALL'S TRIPLE CROWN 
</P>

<P>
Long after the final spike, Sinjin Smith sat signing autographs and posing for 
pictures with kids, both big and little. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is the senior member of the professional beach volleyball tour. Thirteen 
years ago, at the age of 20, he would play for six-packs of beer. Saturday, he 
and partner Randy Stoklos played for and won $70,000 in the $150,000 Cuervo 
Gold Crown at Mariner's Point. 
</P>
<P>
By defeating Tim Hovland and Kent Steffes, 15-6, in a championship match 
witnessed by about 8,000 spectators, the pair became the first team in history 
to win all three Gold Crown events in one season. 
</P>
<P>
And with each victory, each autograph, each picture, Smith realizes he is 
becoming a bit of a celebrity, something he never envisioned in 1977 when he 
first started playing professionally. Smith hasn't lost his appetite for making 
his living knocking a volleyball over the net. It gets more fun each year. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he said, "it can be more exciting now than when I started. People 
want our autographs. We're stars more than we've ever been. We've earned 
respect all over the country for something we enjoy doing, playing volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
Stoklos and Smith have been partners for nine years, which is as good an 
explanation as any why they continue to win more than any other team. It is all 
about familiarity and teamwork. Smith plays his steady, consistent game, 
keeping points alive with digs that sometimes make you rub your eyes. And 
Stoklos just hammers away with his patented "Kong Blocks" and crunching spikes. 
</P>
<P>
So when somebody suggested Saturday to Stoklos that $70,000 wasn't bad for a 
day's work, he responded: "No, it's not bad for a day's work, but it's a 
culmination of 10 years of work and nine years of playing with Sinjin Smith." 
</P>
<P>
After that much time, a team knows how to do the little things. Saturday, they 
forfeited their seventh match after Karch Kiraly and Brent Frohoff forfeited 
theirs against Hovland and Steffes because Frohoff had sustained a back injury 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Under the round-robin format used, the top three teams moved into the 
championship round, with No. 1 advancing straight to the title match and Nos. 2 
and 3 playing off for the other berth. The forfeit by Kiraly and Frohoff 
clinched the top spot for Hovland and Steffes and made the seventh match for 
Stoklos and Smith meaningless. So they elected to rest for the semifinal 
playoff, in which they wound up clubbing Kiraly and a hobbled Frohoff, 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
Stoklos didn't react favorably to the forfeit by Kiraly and Frohoff, saying it 
was a conspiracy by the two teams to make it more difficult for him and Smith 
to win the tournament. Frohoff answered by saying: "I just wanted to save my 
back for that game. If he can't understand that, he's not a human being." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kiraly: "Seeing Brent incapacitated out there just shows how paranoid 
Sinjin and Randy are." 
</P>
<P>
Are they? 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't you be paranoid?" Stoklos asked. 
</P>
<P>
His point was that the top-seeded team always has to look over its shoulder at 
the rest of the pack to see who's closing in. This time it was Kiraly-Frohoff 
and Steffes-Hovland. 
</P>
<P>
When all the politics were complete, the volleyball was entertaining, though 
not particularly suspenseful. Kiraly and Frohoff took a surprising 4-2 lead in 
the semifinal, boosted by Kiraly's high-speed serves. But midway through, 
Frohoff jumped a bit too vigorously for a spike, and he played the remainder of 
the match at half speed. 
</P>
<P>
The final wasn't much different. With help from Smith's skyscraping serves, 
Stoklos and Smith took a 9-0 lead and then worked their way to the victory. 
Stoklos put pressure on Hovland and Steffes throughout the match with powerful 
blocks. At 14-6, Hovland hit his spike a few feet past the end line, and 
Stoklos and Smith had their triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the best I've seen them play since the world championships 
against me and Mike (Dodd) four years ago," said Hovland, whose team earned 
$15,000 for second. "They were the better team today." 
</P>
<P>
For Stoklos and Smith, there have been so many victories, but both admitted 
this was special. Achieving something that no one has accomplished felt pretty 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"You win and you win and you win," Stoklos said. "What else can you do? That's 
what you can do, play like we did right there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "It's the highlight in my career. To be able to pull it off three 
different times. The odds were definitely against us winning."

SOUTH SEEMS UNAFFECTED BY LONG LAYOFF IN 6-2 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEGION: WINNERS MAKE THREE DOUBLE PLAYS IN DOMINATING ALL-STAR GAME.

Roland De La Maza was so rusty that he thought he heard his right arm creak 
like a merry-go-round when he warmed up to pitch in the inaugural American 
Legion North-South All-Star Game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto with North teammate Shane Cowsill, who couldn't help but wonder aloud how 
the players from the South managed to stay so finely tuned in the weeks before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where they've been playing to stay so sharp," Cowsill said, 
pointing to the South dugout. "But the only guys on this team that have been 
playing lately are the guys from (state champion) Woodland Hills West." 
</P>
<P>
The North scored a pair of runs in the final two innings to make the score 
respectable, but the South prevailed, 6-2, at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
De La Maza, a right-hander from Panorama City, started and allowed two 
first-inning runs. Considering the high-scoring nature of most all-star games, 
it didn't seem cause for alarm, but it was nearly all that South right-hander 
Matt Meyers of Chino and his teammates would need. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers, named the game's most valuable player, allowed one hit over three 
innings, struck out six and walked two in picking up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing so smooth, so easy," North co-Coach Jody Breeden said of 
Meyers, who struck out the side in the third. "He was impressive." 
</P>
<P>
So was the South offense, which came out swinging despite the fact that most 
players on both teams had not suited up in at least three weeks. The South 
banged out five hits in De La Maza's two-inning stint to take a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a bad day," said De La Maza, who will be a sophomore at College of 
the Canyons in the fall. "I hadn't pitched in a while, which is no excuse. I 
was just a mess out there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly first two innings for us. After that, we were OK." 
</P>
<P>
Aesthetically, perhaps. But three runs were all the South needed. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-0, the North didn't advance a baserunner to third until the sixth 
when it loaded the bases against reliever John Lynn of Fullerton. David Cooke 
of Lancaster singled with one out and took second when Bobby Kim of Woodland 
Hills West reached base on an error. With two out, Chris Prince of Van 
Nuys-Notre Dame walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lynn retired Cowsill of Glendale -- a home run hitter -- on a line 
drive to right to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
The North broke through for a run in the eighth off reliever Guy Pinelli of 
Fullerton to close to within 5-1. Again it was Cooke who started the rally by 
drawing a one-out walk. Tyler Nelson of Simi Valley singled, and, after Kim 
struck out, Prince walked to reload the bases for Cowsill. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way I wanted to strand three more guys out there," Cowsill said, 
laughing. "That would have been horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Cowsill singled to left to drive in Cooke, cutting the lead to 
5-1. Pinelli, however, struck out Steve Philbrook of Ventura to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
After the South turned two Cowsill walks and a passed ball into its sixth run 
in the top of the ninth, the North mounted its final threat. Brett Schaffer of 
Santa Monica, Paul Geller of Woodland Hills West and Joe Keller of Pomona 
singled to load the bases with none out. Cooke drove in Schaffer with a 
fielder's choice ground out, but Pinelli retired Nelson on a 6-4-3 double play 
to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was no fluke. The South showed no signs of a layoff defensively, either -- 
it turned three double plays. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Rich Racine of Rancho Cucamonga walked and moved to third on a 
single by Chad Marlow of Fullerton. After a one-out, run-scoring grounder made 
it 1-0, Shane Borowski of Fullerton drove in Marlow with a single. 
</P>
<P>
North Coach Don Hornback of Woodland Hills West missed the game because he was 
suffering from viral pneumonia. He is expected to return for West's games in 
the regional tournament.

A LEG UP ON THE COMPETITION; 
</P>
<P>
TAE KWON DO ATHLETE CHAO IS A 1992 OLYMPIC HOPEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
While some athletes can't stop talking about themselves and their skills, Hsian 
Chao is a competitor of very few words. 
</P>
<P>
Chao, who celebrated her 16th birthday two weeks ago, doesn't like to talk 
about her feats in the martial arts. In fact, she doesn't like to talk at all. 
</P>
<P>
But oral communication had nothing to do with the 36 gold medals the Rancho 
Palos Verdes teen-ager has earned in just a few years of tae kwon do 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a natural -- a genius of this martial art," master Kwon Sung Choi said. 
"The best I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Choi, who was recently appointed coach of the U.S. National Team, persuaded 
Chao to try the Korean martial art six years ago. He has been amazed by the 
5-foot-3, 105-pound girl ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it takes three years to get a black belt," Choi said. "She took only 
two years, one month." 
</P>
<P>
Choi, an 11-time Korean national champion and sixth-degree black belt, said 
Chao is much better than he ever was. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it because I've spent almost 30 years in tae kwon do, but I've 
never seen this kind of girl," he said. "Her legs, and her punching and kicking 
are actually stronger than boys. She's powerful like a spring." 
</P>
<P>
Choi, a two-time coach at the U.S. Olympic Festival, said that Chao's speed and 
snap enables her to break four to five inches of wooden board with her bare 
hands and feet -- a very difficult task for girls of a similar build. 
</P>
<P>
"But she is a very shy girl," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Chao to try tae kwon do wasn't easy for Choi. 
</P>
<P>
The master first met Chao, then 9, when she would wait for her younger brother 
Hueh to finish his workout with Choi at the San Pedro Tae Kwon Do Training 
Center. She loved to watch the workouts, but would never join the group when 
asked to. After eight months of urging, Choi finally got Chao on the mat. After 
a kick and a punch, she was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before the other students learned about the new kid in class. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to find her an opponent," Choi said. "Actually it has to be girl to girl 
and boy to boy but there was no opponent for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the boys, 'Who is going to be Hsian's opponent?' They all stood there 
tongue faced. They didn't want to fight her -- she's too strong." 
</P>
<P>
Chao earned her first-degree black belt in August of 1986. From there she went 
on to become a Junior National Champion twice. 
</P>
<P>
In February of 1989 she graduated to a second degree black belt. In early 
December Chao took her first big step at establishing herself among senior 
world-class tae kwon do competitors. She defeated Diana Radakovich, who was a 
national team member at the time, after flooring her twice in the championship 
match of the Las Vegas Invitational. Radakovich and Chao are good friends and 
schoolmates at Narbonne High. 
</P>
<P>
Chao took first-place honors at the state tournament in Bakersfield in March, 
qualifying her for the U.S. National Championships in Madison, Wis., in May. 
She finished third at the national tournament, giving her a berth to the U.S. 
Team Trials at the Olympic Center in Colorado Springs in June. 
</P>
<P>
Chao dropped all six top-ranked women in the flyweight division in Colorado to 
earn a spot on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Her final victories over world champions Terry Poindexter and Ginean Hatter put 
Chao on the 1992 Olympic hopeful list. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Solo, manager of the Palos Verdes Tae Kwon Do Training Center where Chao 
has worked out since its opening in February, said she is the one athlete to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you something, she's the gold medalist of 1992, barring injury," 
Solo said. 
</P>
<P>
Chao shakes her head in disagreement at this comment and most of what is said 
about her talent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over her head," Solo said. "She's basically a child with unset goals." 
</P>
<P>
Choi instructed Chao to call him from Minneapolis to tell him how she did in 
the championship match of last month's Olympic Festival. When Chao didn't call 
him or her mother, Choi assumed that she had lost. It wasn't until Choi picked 
up Chao at the airport the next day that the coach learned the truth. She won 
the match, but "didn't think it was any big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Chao's schedule will only get busier over the next few months. She left for 
Korea last week to participate in a foreign exchange tae kwon do program with 
Korea and Chinese Taipei. One week after her return, she will fly out to 
Colorado to work out with other National Team members at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center. From there the team will fly together to Bayamon, Puerto Rico, 
for the 7th annual Pan-American Taekwondo Championships. 
</P>
<P>
In early November, Chao will travel to Madrid for the World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
Chao's parents, James and Helen Chao, who own and operate Pung Lai's Chinese 
Restaurant in Lomita, have three children, all of whom are black belts. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very lucky," Helen Chao said. "I never have to worry about (Hsian). She 
takes care of everything at home -- cleaning and the children. She always says, 
'don't worry mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Helen Chao is proud of her daughter's accomplishments, but is more amused by 
Hsian's tae kwon do moves than she is awe-struck. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be going to the movies, or walking down the street, or something and 
she'll do a side kick. I say to her, 'Hsian, you are not like a normal girl -- 
stop doing that.' She says, 'OK, mom,' but five minutes later she's doing it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Helen worrys about her daughter's education and fears that too much time is 
spent in the studio instead of with the books. 
</P>
<P>
But Hsian has maintained a 4.0 grade-point average through her sophomore year 
in the Magnet Program at Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about her daughter's prospects of competing in the Olympic Games, 
Helen said: "I don't know, are the Olympic Games important?"

HUBER PUTS A HALT TO HER FALTERING, RALLIES TO WIN GIRLS' 16S TITLE

Ditta Huber was still four games away from a defeat in the U.S. Tennis Assn. 
Girls' 16s National Championships singles final Saturday, but for all intents 
and purposes, she already had lost it. Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the first set in a tiebreaker, third-seeded Huber of La Jolla 
dropped the second set, 6-1, and was trailing, 2-0, with No. 4 Lisa Pugliese of 
Boca Raton, Fla., serving. 
</P>
<P>
Pugliese could sense it. The crowd of about 500 who watched at Morley Field's 
stadium court sensed it. The hometown favorite, who had played nearly perfectly 
for a week, wouldn't pull this one out. 
</P>
<P>
Then Huber, 14, went from awful to awesome. She won the last six games, 
breaking Pugliese's serve three times, and won, 7-6 (9-7), 1-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Huber later teamed with Lindsay Davenport of Palos Verdes to win the doubles 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Huber and Pugliese approached the singles final with different game plans and 
never deviated. Huber attacked from the opening serve, usually sending powerful 
topspin returns toward the corners. Pugliese, who beat Huber, 7-5, 6-2, in the 
1990 Easter Bowl tournament, chose to be patient, rally and let Huber beat 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it was practically Huber's match to win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
And after winning the first set, Huber hit the skids. For eight consecutive 
games, she couldn't get anything to fall. Everything was long, wide or in the 
net. Twenty-two of the 30 points Pugliese scored while winning the second set 
came on Huber misses. And before Huber served at love-40 in the final game of 
the set, she cried out loud, "I don't know how to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my concentration," Huber said. "I was getting frustrated. I tried 
everything. I tried to slow the ball down. I tried to hit though it. I tried to 
lob. It just wasn't working. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not one to worry. I just kept hitting." 
</P>
<P>
And the errors kept coming for Huber, who opened the third set by hitting 
wildly on seven of the first eight points. Then, in the third game, Huber said 
she looked up at some of the other players who were watching. The thought 
occured to her that she and Pugliese, by winning this tournament, were the only 
ones who still had a shot a wild-card berth in the Junior U.S. Open in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what made me think of it, but it just went though my mind," Huber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of playing against foreign players and possibly hitting with 
"someone famous" at Flushing Meadows, N.Y., sparked Huber's third-set comeback. 
She hit an overhead smash to break Pugliese's second serve, then won the last 
six games. She closed out the match with two backhand service returns for 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what happened," Pugliese said. "She just became more confident 
all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
Huber led Pugliese, 4-2, in the first set but Pugliese broke back to lead, 5-4. 
Huber then went ahead, 6-5, before Pugliese forced a tiebreaker. Huber led, 
4-0, in the tiebreaker, then made five consecutive unforced errors to give 
Pugliese a 5-4 lead. Huber won when Pugliese missed long with a return. 
</P>
<P>
But as she did throughout the match, Huber dominated the set with 26 winners 
and 28 unforced errors; Pugliese had 13 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Huber and Davenport, seeded No. 1 in doubles, defeated fourth-seeded Amy 
Chiminello of Melrose, Mass., and Holyn Lord of Carmel, Ind., 6-0, 7-5.

The U.S. Cycling Federation Junior Nationals draw to a close today with the 
road race finals scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. along Lusk Boulevard on Sorrento 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the 13-14-year-old boys go off, but the big race will begin at 
approximately 12:30 p.m., when the 16-17 girls hit the course. Among them will 
be Jessica Grieco of Emerson, N.J., who will be attempting something never 
accomplished -- sweeping all seven gold medals in the 10-day event. 
</P>
<P>
Grieco already has won the criterium, the four track events (200-meter flying 
time trial, 2,000-meter pursuit, sprint and points race) and the time trial. 
</P>
<P>
Her biggest challenge will likely come from Denise Mueller of Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
At the Junior Worlds last month, Grieco won three silver medals, one in the 
road race. Mueller took fourth in that race but today will be riding in front 
of a hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
There were three mishaps in Saturday's qualifying races, held only for the 
15-16 and 17-18 boys. Two occurred some 50 yards in front of the finish line in 
each of the 15-16 heats. 
</P>
<P>
Some blamed the course for the accidents, saying it wasn't challenging enough 
and that too many riders were still in a lead pack at the end. 
</P>
<P>
But many riders and coaches blamed the accidents on inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people here who aren't used to riding in packs," said Steven 
Meilicke of Santa Rosa, winner of the first heat. "And it was so tight at the 
end, people were getting kind of squirrelly." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sam Guzman of Richmond, Va.: "People were just jamming together. 
Everybody wants to do as well as they can so they can get to the final." 
</P>
<P>
Concluded Rene Wenzel, national team coach, "This course in Europe would be no 
problem at all -- they're so used to it (riding in packs) over there." 
</P>
<P>
There were three heats for the 17-18 boys, and in only one did a single rider 
go for a breakaway. That came in the second heat, when Bennie Ray of Columbus, 
Ohio, finished some 30 seconds in front. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like pack sprints," Ray said. "I just wanted to give myself a 
wide-enough gap." 
</P>
<P>
Cycling Notes 
</P>
<P>
There were three Junior National records set at the time trials in Borrego 
Springs Friday. Jessica Grieco (29:41) bettered the old 20-kilometer mark of 
31:48 for girls 16-17, Heath Sandall (27:59) beat the old mark of 28:47 for 
boys 13-14 and Susan George (30:38) lowered the old record of 31:48 for girls 
13-15.

</P>
<P>
The Nomads had 29 shots on goal and finished their season with an 8-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
J.J. Kenzel's goal broke a 1-1 tie as San Dieguito Surf defeated a West German 
team, 2-1, to reach today's semifinals in the boys' 16 division of the San 
Dieguito Surf International tournament. San Dieguito Surf will play the Bonita 
Rebels, and the Alta Loma Arsenal will face the Mission Viejo Pateadores in the 
other semifinal. North Huntington Beach plays the La Jolla Nomads in one boys' 
19 semifinals, Cisco (Phoenix, Ariz) facing San Pedro in the other.

JAMES FLANIGAN: WATCH OUT FOR DEFLATION, NOT INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was easy last week to see inflation ahead for the U.S. economy, but the 
reality may be just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rising oil prices, the real trend in a slow economy is much more likely 
to be deflation. Other than oil, the price of many things will decline. 
</P>
<P>
That's not an especially pleasing prospect. Along with lower prices, deflation 
means falling wages, profits and real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
But whether you're planning investments or household expenditures, it's best to 
face reality. And reality is that rising oil won't lift other prices, but will 
eat up what little discretionary purchasing power the American consumer has 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Figure it out. There are no big wage hikes in the U.S. economy, so consumers' 
disposable income isn't rising -- and consumer debt has been up to the limit 
for some time. So the extra $5 to $10 a week for gasoline and heating fuel will 
come out of other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits will be under pressure, an obvious downer for stocks, says 
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
Deflation also means interest rates will be coming down, which should make 
today's high-interest government bonds attractive, although nothing today is a 
sure bet. 
</P>
<P>
The real story is that the 1990s will not be a rerun of the inflationary 1970s. 
At that time, when oil prices rose in 1973-74, prices of everything else were 
already rising. It was an economy stretched tight in the aftermath of the 
Vietnam War. President Nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971; the price 
of bread rose sharply in 1972 when the United States sold grain to the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Then the 1973 leap in oil prices blew the lid off. An inflationary spiral 
followed as business passed along fuel increases to customers and employees 
tried to keep up living standards by demanding higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
Things are different today, even if some businesses don't recognize it. Many 
airlines are trying to hike fares 5% to 10% to cover fuel costs. But those fare 
hikes may not survive in a slow summer for air travel. 
</P>
<P>
Just a month ago American Airlines was forced to withdraw a proposed ticket 
surcharge for airport costs because competitors wouldn't go along. It's hard to 
raise prices when customers are already staying away. 
</P>
<P>
The deflationary effect will be seen in consumer decisions small and large. 
McDonald's reports slackening sales growth in U.S. markets. Movie box office 
receipts are lagging in what was billed as a "blockbuster" summer. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, house prices are declining in many parts of the country and 
commercial property values are falling. "We've seen declines in assets, we're 
about to see them in profits and wages," says an investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
"On wages, both our attitudes and our bargaining power are different today," 
says Daniel Mitchell, head of the Institute of Industrial Relations at UCLA. In 
the 1970s we were shocked and offended that foreign oil producers could affect 
American living standards, and we demanded to be "protected" through rising 
paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Today we are no longer shocked, and we understand that inflation does not 
"protect" living standards. In any case, most workers -- union and nonunion 
alike -- don't have the leverage to demand more pay. 
</P>
<P>
Deflation is not pretty. Unemployment will rise to more than 6%, from today's 
5.3%, in the coming recession, says Mitchell. That's not as bad as the 1970s in 
percentage terms, but it still means 7 million to 8 million Americans out of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the government won't be able to alleviate unemployment through 
public works programs. There is no spare spending capacity; the slow economy 
and savings and loan bailout have already boosted the federal deficit to 
historic totals -- at least $250 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 
from $225 billion in the current fiscal year. And with the cost of military 
action in the Middle East, deficits are likely to keep growing. 
</P>
<P>
That means that the Treasury, which last week sold $32 billion of debt 
securities at interest rates of 8% (for three-year maturities) to 8.87% (for 30 
years), will be selling more debt than usual in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
There are fears that the Treasury will have to offer even higher rates in the 
future -- which would push down the value of today's bonds. But experts are 
divided, with some arguing that the decline of private credit demand in a 
recession will offset increased government borrowing and thus reduce the need 
for higher Treasury rates. 
</P>
<P>
It's a bleak prospect either way, and it contains a bitter lesson. For years 
economists and politicians have debated whether the federal deficit makes any 
real difference. Well, we're about to find out how it limits flexibility in 
hard times, preventing government spending to repair America's infrastructure, 
or a lowering of taxes to revive the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the deficit also argues against lower interest rates, which will 
discourage foreign capital from buying Treasury bonds. But you can bet that 
when more Americans lose their jobs, the Federal Reserve will lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Over time the economy will revive. And maybe we'll have learned another lesson.

IMCDS -- INTERACTIVE, MULTIMEDIA COMPACT DISCS -- PLACE A COMPUTERIZED 
ENCYCLOPEDIA AT YOUR FINGERTIPS AS YOU LISTEN TO THE MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURENCE VITTES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine listening to a compact disc and simultaneously having access to a 
computerized, user-friendly, verbal and visual encyclopedia about the music. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you're listening to Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 and the 
computer program -- in a chapter about musical pitches -- informs you: 
"Musicians eventually became frustrated. Picture the situation: Wonderful tunes 
were invented, became Top 40 chants, but suddenly were forgotten because 
someone's memory lapsed. No wonder Gregorian chants were simple -- what else 
was a poor monk to do." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of IMCDs: interactive, multimedia compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many people know they exist, and few have the equipment on which to 
play them. But they and their equivalents are destined to play a role in home 
entertainment of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
According to Allan Ayars, director of multimedia industry services for 
Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, probably fewer than 10,000 of 
these systems exist. But by 1994, Ayars expects the market for the systems to 
reach half a million, driven by the rapidly increasing number of software 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
That's why companies are lavishing thousands of hours and hundreds of thousands 
of dollars on so few potential customers. To Santa Monica-based Voyager Co., 
it's all about publishing. "Our goal is to be the Random House of tomorrow," 
spokesman Bob Stein says. "But tomorrow isn't here yet. What we're trying to do 
now is to establish our position and survive." 
</P>
<P>
To Warner New Media, the issue is keeping competitive in an uncertain future. 
Company president Stan Cornyn says, "If you're a large corporation, you don't 
want to be blindsided by new technology," but he adds that "I would like to see 
more players out there. It's kind of strange to be making a lot of phonograph 
records for a universe where there are no phonographs." 
</P>
<P>
IMCDs are played on a CD-ROM player hooked up to a Macintosh personal computer 
and an audio playback system. The most visible IMCDs to date, classical music 
presentations from Voyager and Warner New Media, demonstrate the medium's 
potential to such great effect that both the home electronics and the computer 
industries are convinced that these classical music IMCDs have opened a window 
onto the future. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs allow people to manipulate audio and visual information with 
the power they previously had only over words and numbers," says Peter Bloch, 
president of Interactive Production Associates in Santa Monica, whose company 
made the interactive programs on illuminated manuscripts that you can see at 
the Getty Museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"Compare the multimedia programs with books, and you can see that we're 
offering an entertaining, gamelike environment. If a picture is worth a 
thousand words, an interactive multimedia environment containing words and 
pictures is worth ten thousand." 
</P>
<P>
Interactive multimedia has been around since the '70s for industrial and 
educational purposes. Until late 1988, however, it was too expensive for the 
home. That changed in late 1988, with the development of sound generating 
software for CD-ROMs (read-only memory compact discs with massive storage 
capacities). Since then, most of the world's major entertainment and computer 
companies, including Sony, Philips, IBM, Intel, Yamaha, Apple, Commodore and 
NEC, have embraced the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The system recommended by both Voyager and Warner New Media consists of an 
Apple Macintosh computer with at least one megabyte of memory, an 
Apple-compatible hard drive with at least five megabytes of free space, an 
Apple-compatible CD-ROM drive, and an audio playback system. Prices for the 
computer components have fallen as low as $1,700 (down from $3,200 just 12 
months ago), but getting into this new technology may still be too expensive 
for many otherwise interested consumers. The alternative, unfortunately, is an 
indefinite waiting time, until the Voyager and Warner Media programs are made 
available for MS-DOS setups and such specific players as Commodore's CDTV, due 
this fall, and Sony-Philips' CDI machine, due in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Why classical music? Laura Boddine, president of Tiger Media in Downey, whose 
first interactive multimedia program, Airwave Adventures, the Case of the 
Cautious Condor, was recently named Best Adventure program in Japan, explains: 
"Classical music is a niche market. When CD audio came out, classical music 
products were important because there was a ready market, even though it was a 
small one. 
</P>
<P>
"Interactive multimedia is a very expensive medium to work in, there's no 
installed base. But there's lots of public-domain content available and no 
royalties have to be paid to Beethoven or Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
More important is Apple's Macintosh, an ideal computer on which to develop a 
multimedia product -- its graphics-based environment and HyperCard software 
suited to recording, connecting, relating and remembering the staggering number 
of words, pictures and sounds that the interactive medium requires. 
</P>
<P>
Each classical IMCD contains a complete audio recording plus information on the 
music's history, technical features and stylistic content in the form of text 
and pictures, viewed on the computer's screen, and additional musical examples 
and audio commentaries. A "mouse," the Macintosh's interactive pointing device, 
is used to move from one information screen to another with a technique called 
"clicking." You can simply listen to the music straight through with or without 
reading the screens, or concentrate on individual movements or even single 
chords that you can repeat over and over. 
</P>
<P>
The first classical IMCD was Beethoven's Ninth, using Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt's 
Vienna Philharmonic recording. It was written by UCLA professor Robert Winter 
and published in 1989 by Voyager as the first title in its CD Companion Series 
($99). Apple CEO John Sculley was impressed: In his opening remarks to the 
MacWorld Conference last fall, he heralded the Ninth as a key to the future of 
computing. Consumers have been impressed: They have bought more than 6,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
Turning on the Macintosh and calling up the programs reveals an index card-like 
screen with a picture of Beethoven and a table of contents. "Each of the five 
chapters," Winter explains, "takes the user to a different level of complexity. 
The simplest level is called 'The Pocket Map,' which lays the four movements 
out with structural guideposts so that you have a sense of where you're going. 
You can click on, say, 'First movement, second theme,' and hear the music 
immediately. You can stay at this level for 20 minutes or more, having fun 
going here and there, making connections at a very basic level." 
</P>
<P>
The second level, called "Beethoven's World," supplies cultural, political and 
social background on Vienna of the 1820s, where Beethoven wrote the Ninth 
Symphony. Again, many of the graphics, musical instruments for example, are 
linked to passages in the music that can be listened to nearly instantaneously. 
The third stack, called "The Art of Listening," explains the musical 
architecture of the Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like with a painting," Winter explains, "where bits of color, shape and 
form interrelate, Beethoven's Ninth consists of hundreds of individual sounds. 
If you were to scramble them, the piece would not be very impressive. It is the 
way in which they grow, develop, come together and unfold that the music gains 
its power." 
</P>
<P>
At the fourth level, "A Close Reading," the Ninth plays through in its entirety 
while everything happening in the music is being explained in vivid, clear 
English with the persuasive authority of a world-class scholar ("Just when it 
does not seem possible to generate more excitement, the . . . choral entries do 
just that, enlivened by a series of electrifying orchestral trills," Winter 
writes of a section in the fourth movement). 
</P>
<P>
The last level, "Fun &amp; Games," is a "Jeopardy"-like series of questions 
exploiting the relationship between ideas and sound. The computer, of course, 
keeps score. 
</P>
<P>
At any moment, at any level, you can jump from movement to movement, from 
section to section, simply by clicking with the mouse. And, any time there's a 
technical term -- even one as basic as "movement," a clear, down to earth 
explanation is only a mouse click away, often with a musical example. According 
to Winter, "A reasonably alert 8-year-old will be able to use the CD Companion 
as well as a seasoned 80-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
The second classical IMCD was Mozart's "Magic Flute," using Nikolaus 
Harnoncourt's 1988 Zurich recording. It was written by a team supervised by Cal 
State Fullerton's Irene Gurtin and published three months ago by Burbank-based 
Warner New Media as the first title in its Audio Notes series ($66). Customers 
at Tower's Sunset Strip classical store were impressed. The store has sold out 
two shipments and is waiting for its third. 
</P>
<P>
Although the "Flute" operates in exactly the same way as Beethoven's Ninth -- 
using a mouse to move from screen to screen, exploring relationships between 
music and information -- there are more than minor cosmetic differences. Warner 
New Media head Stan Cornyn explains that "Voyager's is at this point looked 
upon as a Robert Winter vehicle, in the best sense. His Beethoven Ninth 
therefore was an attempt to communicate what he had to say about Beethoven's 
Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a different approach, putting all sorts of extra audio on. We have 
narrators talking, Florence Foster Jenkins singing, and so on. Our HyperCard 
stack, between 7,000 and 10,000 cards, is much larger and tends to encompass a 
great deal more. We are trying not to take one man's idiosyncratic view of 
anything, but trying to present a broader sense of things. Theirs is the auteur 
approach, ours the generalist's." 
</P>
<P>
Given the lively sense of competition between the two companies (Cornyn and 
Winter worked together at one point), it's not surprising that their new titles 
share such enhancements as audio commentaries and graphic representations. 
Previewing Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" from Voyager, using the Charles 
Dutoit/Montreal Symphony recording and written by Winter (scheduled for release 
this month), and Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 from Warner New Media, using 
the Vermeer Quartet's recording and written by a team supervised by 
editor-in-chief Cynthia Woll (scheduled for September), revealed improved 
production values and greater ease of handling. 
</P>
<P>
Woll's Beethoven Quartet ($50) also reveals more personality than the "Magic 
Flute," combining authoritative eloquence with a delightful sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Its five main levels (called "Spines" as if they were the spines of books) 
allow real-time, full-length analyses of the work from levels suitable for 
beginners to levels suitable to experienced listeners. The "Blueprint" spine 
contains graphic representation of the music and the "Notebook" spine allows 
the user to enter his or her own thoughts. At all times, "hotkey" options 
appear on screen like sidebars in magazines. When you're reading the "Tempo 
Guide" screen, for example, you can "hotkey" (the Warner nomenclature for mouse 
clicking) to "Beethoven &amp; The Metronome," "Quartet Map," or "Index"; while 
reading an "Exploring the Music" screen, you can "hotkey" to "About Melody," 
"Chamber Music Lovers" or "About Chamber Music." 
</P>
<P>
Although Voyager's new "Sacre du Printemps" ($99.95) is also expanded and 
improved, the format is the same: The opening screen offers menu choices 
including "A Pocket Guide" (a one-screen orientation to the entire work); 
"Stravinsky's World" (on the composer's life and times); "Rite Listening" (a 
chatty introduction to the music); "Dancing the Rite" (discussing the actual 
production); "A Close Reading," a real-time commentary, and "The Rite Game." 
</P>
<P>
If, after listening to the opening bassoon solo, you want to hear a bassoon all 
by itself, you go to the glossary, click on bassoon and the bassoon plays 
alone. You can access all the instruments of the orchestra, each with a 
characteristic audio excerpt from "Sacre." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager does offer a unique product, the CD AudioStack, a stand-alone program 
retailing for $99.95 that allows CD-ROM users to play and precisely control 
off-the-shelf CDs. It's like making your own CD Companion. 
</P>
<P>
The future? Voyager has Winter doing the first three Brandenburg Concertos and 
histories of early jazz and mid-'50s rock in the planning stages, while, later 
this month, he and the Angeles Quartet will do a five-camera shoot of Mozart's

There's little doubt that both Mozart and Beethoven would have been eager and 
consummate multimedia authors. Not only was Mozart a superb writer, as attested 
to by his voluminous letters, but he was an avid game player who invented a 
do-it-yourself composing method using dice. And, adds Winter, "Beethoven called 
himself a Tonkunstler, a painter with tones. Even in his time, a composer was 
considered both an artist and a scientist, someone with great skill in 
manipulating materials."

THE POP CHARTS WOULD HAVE MORE MEANING IF HIT MAKERS CHANNELED THEIR PASSION 
INTO THEIR MUSIC INSTEAD OF WHINING OVER BAD REVIEWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the bittersweet ironies of the current pop scene is that many of today's 
biggest sellers inject more passion into their interviews than into their 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that passion, however, is wasted by the artists on complaints that 
critics dismiss their work for reasons that have almost nothing to do with 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Bad reviews, the artists maintain, are due to such extraneous issues as how 
much money they have or how carefully they groom their hair. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments are amusing on one level because they're so superficial, but they 
are symptoms of an unwillingness among many of our artists who consistently top 
the pop charts to face some issues undermining the quality of pop music in the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than document excellence in music these days, the pop charts all too 
often simply chronicle the conservative judgments of radio programmers and the 
success of marketing campaigns. That's the bittersweet reality of today's pop 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lets these charts -- or radio -- serve as their guides to what they 
should be listening to is probably missing out on the most inspiring currents 
of pop music today. The fact that many of our top hit makers are among those 
who don't recognize this reality speaks to the depth of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
If they spent more time concentrating on their music and less time trying to 
rationalize why their music isn't more critically admired, we'd all be better 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the big four of pop-star complaints: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 -- Critics don't like me because of my hair. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Marx, who has had nine consecutive hit singles despite music that's 
colorless and almost totally void of revealing edges, blamed his bad press 
recently on his lushly sculpted hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have thick hair, which I think (upsets) a lot of bald critics," the pop 
singer told the Times' Steve Hochman in July, drawing attention to his long 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read bad reviews of me and when I read slams in the press, I don't ever 
read, 'He doesn't sing well' or 'He doesn't write melodic songs' or 'He doesn't 
work hard on stage or produce good records,' " he said. "I read, 'His hair's 
too perfect.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Marx had indeed stumbled upon a truism in pop, Don Henley and John 
Mellencamp, among others, would be the targets of every critic in the country. 
Henley's hair was so self-consciously long on the last tour that he spent half 
his time on stage brushing it out of his eyes, yet Henley is among the most 
admired figures in pop. Ditto for Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 -- Critics don't like me because I'm rich. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Collins was upset earlier this year because so many critics have 
maintained that Collins, one of pop's biggest sellers in the '80s even though 
his music tends to lack invention and fiber, is unconvincing when he sings 
about such social issues as the homeless and racism in his latest album, ". . . 
But Seriously Folks." 
</P>
<P>
In a January interview with The Times' Dennis Hunt, Collins blamed the response 
on his comfortable financial status. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're rich, people assume you're an insensitive jerk who's out of touch," 
Collins said. "But there's some decent rich people too. Having money doesn't 
turn you into a jerk. If those critics knew me, they wouldn't be making rash 
assumptions about me. I'm rich, but I'm not a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
That's certainly more biting than anything Collins has put on record in years. 
The problem with Collins' argument is that it ignores the fact that some of the 
most commercially successful pop artists -- including Bruce Springsteen, 
Prince, U2 and Stevie Wonder -- are praised by critics for their social 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that there's more conviction and character in their music. 
Collins may care as deeply about social issues, but he surrounded his views in 
the album with such gentle, unthreatening pop strains that many listeners no 
doubt didn't even realize the songs are supposed to be social laments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 -- Critics don't like me because they don't think I'm rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel has complained repeatedly that one reason he's not better 
appreciated by critics is that the writers tend to be rock fans and they don't 
see him as a legitimate rocker. 
</P>
<P>
Raising the point again in Rolling Stone magazine last January, Joel said: "Me, 
I've had a . . . war with the press going on forever, and that's one war you 
cannot win. . . . They don't see me as this authentic rock 'n' roller. . . . I 
never pretended to be one." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if pop critics truly couldn't see past rock, why are Randy Newman, Paul 
Simon and Tom Waits so widely acclaimed? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 -- Critics don't like me because I'm too popular. 
</P>
<P>
The argument here is that critics are snobs who only like struggling or unknown 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Collins -- here's that guy again -- employed this reasoning in a recent letter 
to my colleague Chris Willman, who had reviewed a Collins performance at the 
Forum. Willman called the singer-songwriter a pop underachiever -- a gifted 
musician who sacrifices some of his artistic potential in order to connect with 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Collins said: "Critics like you assume a holier than thou 
position (and feel) . . . if it's a 'hit' its gotta be cheap . . . and written 
for the lowest common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
The populist stance is no more true than the first three defenses, but it 
deserves more attention because it is probably the one defense most voiced by 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints that critics don't like anything that is popular aren't leveled only 
by defensive artists. Pop fans, too, often raise it. 
</P>
<P>
These fans expect critics to write about and praise successful acts, but they 
often think critics are being self-indulgent or playing favorites when they 
applaud unknown artists or someone whose style is perceived by the mainstream 
listener to be extreme -- punk in the late '70s or rap in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
If a record's any good, it's going to be a hit, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It was possible once to write only about hits and touch on the most vital 
strains in pop music, but no longer. 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of mediocre hit makers in the '50s and '60s -- from Pat Boone 
and the Crew-Cuts to Bobby Vee and Tommy Roe. But the Top 10 was also filled 
those years with the works of such gifted figures as Elvis Presley, Little 
Richard, Buddy Holly, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Creedence Clearwater Revival, 
Marvin Gaye, the Byrds and the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the '70s that the pop charts began to be dominated by the 
mediocre -- no longer reflecting the brightest and the best of modern pop 
music. The primary reason is that rock-oriented radio stations -- in seeking 
the widest possible audience -- began avoiding artists with the radical and 
adventurous edges. 
</P>
<P>
If this meant that discriminating pop fans could no longer count on the radio 
-- or at least top-rated stations, as opposed to college and alternative 
stations -- as the main guide to stimulating new music, it didn't mean that 
critics or fans couldn't sometimes find brilliant work in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the results of the Village Voice's annual poll of the nation's 
leading pop critics over the years shows that many best-sellers have been 
wildly acclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Village Voice poll is fairly characteristic of the balance these days 
between commercial and relatively unknown on critics' lists. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the 40 best albums of 1989 sold 500,000 or more albums -- enough to 
qualify as gold. Among the artists: De La Soul (the New York rap group that 
topped the poll), Madonna, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman, Don Henley, Soul II 
Soul, the Fine Young Cannibals and the Cure. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than Collins, Marx, New Kids on the Block, Paul Abdul, Bon Jovi, Milli 
Vanilli, Skid Row, Debbie Gibson, Poison, Warrant, Winger, Great White, Kenny 
G, White Lion and other meaningless best-sellers from 1989, the Voice poll 
saluted such commercial underdogs as the Neville Brothers, the Mekons, the 
Pixies, the Replacements and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the latter artists were favored over the best-sellers by critics had 
nothing to do with haircuts, bank accounts or image, but music. Those artists 
on the Voice poll reflect more of the personal vision that has helped expand 
the social and artistic boundaries of pop music over the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
To maximize their talent, Marx, Joel and Collins need to stop swinging at straw 
men and realize the problem is within. To improving their pop-music diet, pop 
audiences too must stop depending on what is on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
Even Marx, Joel and Collins must shudder at an album Top 10 this week that 
includes M.C. Hammer, Wilson Phillips, New Kids on the Block, Poison, Keith 
Sweat and the "Pretty Woman" sound track.

AT OREGON'S SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL, 'GOD'S COUNTRY' FOCUSES ON NEO-NAZISM BOTH ON 
AND OFF STAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
At this year's Oregon Shakespeare Festival in this bucolic town, amid 
performances of "Comedy of Errors" and "Henry V," theatergoers are being 
unnerved by a distressing play about the rise of neo-Nazism in the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Dietz's "God's Country" -- a mix of surrealism and headline news -- is a 
fistful of hate made in the U.S.A. It focuses on the amazing one-year rise, and 
fall, of The Order, a small band of racists responsible for the nation's most 
successful crime spree in history and the murder of Denver radio talk-show host 
Alan Berg. The docudrama is as urgent as a baying street-corner newspaper boy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of grabbing the audience and not allowing them to get 
comfortable," Dietz explains during a telephone interview from his home in 
Minneapolis. "I enjoy rollicking musicals just like the next person. The 
theater can be a wonderful escape. But the theater is also a necessary place 
for a society to confront itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Order, like a number of other supremacist groups, espoused a twisted view 
of Christianity -- the "Identity Doctrine" -- that non-Jewish Caucasians were 
the descendants of the 12 tribes of Israel and God's chosen people. The group 
set out to establish an Aryan republic in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of The Order were convicted of federal racketeering charges after 
committing numerous armed robberies. (They netted $3.6 million during an 
armored-car heist near Ukiah, Calif.) No member faced murder charges for Berg's 
killing, but a few were indicted for "violating Alan Berg's civil rights by 
killing him," as one actor says in the play. The cantankerous Jewish radio 
personality was riddled with automatic-weapon bullets as he stepped out of his 
car on the evening of June 18, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The play, in Ashland through Sept. 16, is gaining worldwide attention. "God's 
Country" premiered two years ago in Seattle, where The Order's founding father, 
Robert Jay Mathews, was killed during a standoff with the FBI in 1984. The 
piece was also presented by the Actors Theatre of Louisville, Ky. And on Aug. 
21, "God's Country" will open in Johannesburg, South Africa, before making its 
way to Pretoria -- both presented by the Performing Arts Council of the 
Transvaal. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Turner, artistic director for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, heard 
about "God's Country" from actors involved with the play's Seattle production. 
He examined the text, which read like a living newspaper. But Turner had 
reservations about producing "God's Country" in Ashland. The play, which spills 
out into the audience, is "on the edge of something dangerous," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an uneasy feeling that the theme of the play -- the Nazi ritual -- was 
pornographic for the Nazis. You might do more harm than good. But I don't feel 
that way anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Turner decided the play's message of growing racism in the Pacific 
Northwest was vital to his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very powerful stuff. It's a dynamic play. It's a docudrama, and we 
haven't done one of those for a long time. It was a change of pace for us. The 
theater can have a reflection on the immediate times, as well as the universal 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
"God's Country," though, isn't always a sellout in Ashland. But Turner doesn't 
regret selecting the play for this season. 
</P>
<P>
"A part of that has to do with its form," he says. "It's about neo-Nazis. "It's 
ugly . . . (but) I wouldn't have done anything else." 
</P>
<P>
It is a timely piece of theater, coming during a period when racial incidents 
are flaring up around the country, from New York City's Bensonhurst to the 
Pacific Northwest -- birthplace of The Order and home to many like-minded 
groups. Accounts of racial attacks or threats appear virtually every day in 
newspapers in Portland and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Even in this picturesque southern Oregon hamlet replete with art galleries and 
coffee shops, right-wing skinheads are suspected of randomly killing household 
pets. Not far from town, the bodies of three cats -- one hanged, one beheaded, 
one mutilated -- were found recently. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to kill something in order to be able to call themselves true 
warriors," explains Michael Kevin, director of the Ashland production. "An 
apartment in town had all of its cats disappear in one fell swoop. It's 
horrific to think it's right in your back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very rare in any theater, particularly at this Shakespeare festival, to 
be involved in a piece this contemporary and this vital for everyone to see," 
Kevin says. "We all have racism in us to some extent. This makes you look at 
the thin line between who you are and who these people are." 
</P>
<P>
Each performance of "God's Country" wraps up with a 20-minute discussion 
between the audience and performers, designed to ease the play's intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussions have been very lively," said Turner. "Now we consider them a 
part of the performance. The actors wanted to bring it back to some rational 
discussion, a sharing of information and feelings. It's a way of coming back to 
earth. The image of audiences leaving at the end of that play and just 
dissipating was not comfortable for us." 
</P>
<P>
The fiery play draws applause from some, but its subject matter leads others to 
walk out mid-performance. One Ashland hotel manager reported that a group of 40 
East Coast tourists refused to see the performance, though they had already 
paid for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like watching the 6 o'clock news," wrote one Ashland critic. "You wish 
you could turn it off, but you can't." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have blasted Dietz for his unconventional style -- narrating 
scenes instead of acting them, such as Berg's murder. Others are convinced 
"God's Country" is a potent, and compelling, statement of our times. 
</P>
<P>
The play is ostensibly set in a Seattle courtroom during the trials of members 
of The Order. But its focus extends beyond the men's jejune ideology; Dietz 
takes his audience into the hearts and homes of America, where racism is born 
and bred. A farmer losing his land needs an enemy to blame; a father warns his 
son to be wary of those with a different shade of skin, slurring those who are 
changing the color of America. The casual acceptance of racism, an off-color 
joke or two rewarded with polite guffaws, gives way to extremist ideology. 
Attitudes give way to action. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in a culture in chaos right now, a culture whose moral barometer 
is bouncing all over the place," says the 32-year-old Dietz. "We're not the 
most forward-thinking country on Earth anymore. We're not the richest country. 
Instead, we're watching countries we used to consider backwards make stunning 
steps forward. That's sending shock waves through this country. 
</P>
<P>
"People are trying to deal with a world that's changing faster than they are 
able to, and it comes down to blame. (They say) 'Let's blame the blacks, the 
Hispanics, the gays. We let them in and they've made our country weak! Let's 
blame the artists for loosening our moral fiber.' Those (racists) are, in a 
frightening way, at the right place in our history. What frightens me is that 
so often we just see the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz grew up in Denver listening to Berg, the sardonic talk-show host who both 
defended the First Amendment rights of the right-wingers to speak out and 
denounced their beliefs. It was this early interest that initially prompted 
Dietz to follow Berg's case. 
</P>
<P>
"He struck me as an amazing character and an amazing story. He had the ability 
to be both benevolent and belligerent in the same breath. The only mistake you 
didn't want to make with Alan Berg was to call him up and agree with him. I 
called him once and agreed with him and I got destroyed: 'You are contributing 
nothing at all!' " 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, where "God's Country" premiered at A Contemporary Theater in the 
summer of 1988, theater officials were worried that the play might draw a 
violent response from white supremacists. An undercover police officer was 
stationed in the theater during every performance. Fortunately, no incidents 
occurred. White supremacists did not publicly comment on the play. But it did 
get the attention of the national press, which led to the upcoming presentation 
in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
A South African actress touring the United States heard a report about the play 
on National Public Radio. She phoned Dietz and asked him for a copy of the 
script, which he promptly mailed her. He heard nothing again until a year 
later, when he received a letter from Peter Terry, assistant artistic director 
for the South African theater where the play will be presented. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Terry told Dietz that "God's Country" speaks of neo-Nazism in a 
voice "more powerful, we feel, than any locally written play about our own 
brand of thuggery." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Terry wrote, "there is a very strong neo-Nazi movement in South 
Africa. One of their acolytes recently murdered eight black people in a shotgun 
spree right outside the office I sit in as I write to you. The subsequent trial 
and multiple death sentences fueled the fires of political and racial tension 
that characterizes this country at present. I then read the play and was 
extremely impressed with it, both as a play and as a piece of theater with 
enormous resonance for South African audiences." 
</P>
<P>
The young and relatively unknown playwright was taken aback with Terry's 
request to perform the play abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just dumbfounded," Dietz said, "to think a specific story in the United 
States would ripple out that far. I was shocked and amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the parts of virulent racists in "God's Country" has been emotionally 
and physically draining for the Ashland performers: 12 actors are required to 
portray 41 roles. The play does not follow dramatic convention of character 
development, and there isn't a beginning, middle or end. "God's Country" is a 
collage of court records, wire stories and racist rituals -- linked by 
surrealistic vignettes depicting xenophobic madness and the seeds of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz hopes to jar theater goers into an awareness of jingoistic extremists -- 
and hidden hates buried in their own hearts. Director Kevin employs much sound 
and fury to reach this end. There's a burning cross, cultlike incantations, and 
the waving around of semi-automatic weapons. Big American flags, as well as 
rock music and clever lighting effects, produce a hypnotic aura. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the power of showing this to a group of people is to not only talk 
about (these groups), but to convey their ability to be seductive and to 
arouse," Dietz says. "No matter what your politics are, when you hear that 
music and see that American flag, you have a visceral response. Having a 
character come on stage and say, 'These people are bad, don't be like them,' 
you're not learning anything." 
</P>
<P>
The play wraps up with U2's song "In God's Country" rumbling through the 
theater, and Mathews, played by Remi Sandri, screaming, "The Order lives!" The 
shadow of a cross is cast on a huge U.S. flag as a boy wearing camouflage 
fatigues and a Nazi armband recites the Pledge of Allegiance. In Ashland, there 
is no curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to give a signal to the audience that the play was over. The 
story lives on," Dietz says. "When people leave the theater, it cannot be with 
a sense that justice was served, the bad guys were caught. It's got to send 
people back to their communities knowing (the problem) is in your community. 
It's a part of your life."

SONIC YOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
New York's Sonic Youth was one of the most important rock bands of the '80s, 
the one that most successfully reconciled that decade's trash-culture 
obsessions with the nihilist urge of punk. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's strangely tuned guitars rang out like distorted bells or Indian 
sarods; its deadpan lyrics lay obscurely as punk koans. Their records were 
noisy and loud, and perennially some of the most popular on college radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the pseudonym Ciccone Youth, they recorded an album-length salute to 
Madonna in 1988, and not even their most avid fans could figure out whether 
they were kidding or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The band -- guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo, bassist Kim Gordon and 
drummer Steve Shelley, all of whom, except Shelley, sing lead on various tracks 
-- has recorded for half the important independent labels in the U.S., 
including SST, Homestead and Blast First. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic Youth may now be tied to the same record company (Geffen) as Cher and 
Guns N' Roses, but it remains the quintessential underground band of the day. 
As the avatar of '80s indie underground rock, making its mega-corporate 
major-label debut with "Goo," its sixth full album, it faced a conundrum: How 
does an aggressively confrontational band make a) a commercial record, without 
b)selling out? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, was to make the record an elaborate joke on the idea of 
making a commercial record -- a hermetic, album-length parody. Its best moments 
include a wistful elegy to Karen Carpenter ("Tunic") and a song about a woman, 
Goo, who raises passivity to an art. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and Moore, Sonic Youth's founders and principal songwriters, talk about 
their new life in the mainstream. They'll be in concert Friday at the Hollywood 
Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: So have you sold out? 
</P>
<P>
Gordon: I don't think anyone really thinks that -- at least musically . . . 
unless they haven't listened to the record. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the poppiness of the record? 
</P>
<P>
Moore: It's certainly not a conscious maneuver on our part. We were writing 
these songs before we were dealing with major labels. Those riffs really rock 
our soul. Why shouldn't we play them if we dig them? I mean, they're funny. 
There's some irony in those songs about that whole commercial thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What difference did being on a major label ultimately make in the album? 
</P>
<P>
Moore: We had a much bigger budget, and we were advised to spend it, which we 
did. Usually, money disciplines what you can do in a studio but this time it 
didn't. Although by the end of the project, we were worried about the budget. 
This cost $150,000. The last one cost $30,000, and that was a double album. 
</P>
<P>
We had to sort of do it in pieces, so the whole physical sense of it was 
disturbed. It's the way Foreigner works, constructing one lead guitar solo from 
like three miles of tape. This was just an experiment in working with overly 
involved studio techniques. 
</P>
<P>
And we learned a lot about the politics of a certain level of the (recording 
studio world). In the next room, you have, like, engineers doing Pepsi 
commercials. And it was funny, because when the Grammys were on, all these 
people were sitting there gathered around the TV, the Pepsi commercial with 
Michael J. Fox came on -- big premiere, kind of blaring -- and I reached over 
and turned it off. The whole room erupted. All those engineers gathered around 
the set had like worked on this commercial for like two months. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did the people at Geffen give you any grief? 
</P>
<P>
Gordon: Not really. I mean, Geffen was the last label we thought we'd ever sign 
to. We were already talking with A&amp;M and Atlantic, but we didn't think they 
were serious. We were looking for a situation where we could have complete 
creative control. Everybody said they'd give it to us, but Geffen actually did. 
We have it in our contract. 
</P>
<P>
There were certain things like the cover . . . we wanted to use the Raymond 
Pettibon drawing, and we liked that in one way it looked like a bootleg, 
y'know, and the record company probably disliked that it was black and white 
even more than they did the text ("I stole my sister's boyfriend . . . within a 
week we killed my parents and hit the road") just thinking that chain stores 
won't carry it in the Midwest. But they put it out. 
</P>
<P>
Q: This obviously isn't what you had in mind when you started as a noise band 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Moore: We were trying to freak people out then, and we didn't really have any 
goals or ambitions. At that age, our ambition was to maybe get a gig someplace. 
We came out of a void, in a way -- we wanted to blow people's minds -- and we'd 
like write songs one night and play them the next at some art benefit, just 
banging on my guitar or a snare drum, Lee playing a guitar and an electric 
drill amped up to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Were you playing mostly to hard-core punks at that point? 
</P>
<P>
Moore: The places we played across the country were hard-core. If you were 
non-hard-core, they treated you kind of weirdly. When we first went on the 
road, we went up and down the East Coast on a tour that we set up ourselves. 
We'd play to like 15 people a night, of whom 10 would be hard-core kids. 
</P>
<P>
So these kids in North Carolina would be coming out to see this New York 
hard-core band, and it would be us. We were more extreme than most hard-core 
bands, but we weren't generic. We were just loud. There was a period when those 
kids would sit in front of the band and demand that we play faster: "Play fast 
songs!" 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does that still happen? 
</P>
<P>
Gordon: When we were in Russia last year, it was the first time in a really 
long time where people had no idea who we were. It was like playing a really 
small town in Alabama or something. And we were playing in absolutely 
acoustically dead rooms, rooms that were made for KGB spokesmen. These 
Lithuanians, like the first independent promoters there, brought us over. And 
people in the audience were yelling, "Punk rock!" because they had just 
discovered the Sex Pistols. The older people -- you get people of all ages over 
there -- were going, "Turn it down!" instead. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you ever feel that you have to be the spokesman for something? 
</P>
<P>
Gordon: It used to be (people asked me about) women in rock. Now (they ask) 
about being signed to a major label. It's kind of annoying being put in that 
position. Sonic Youth has always been the exception to the rule, so we're 
terrible spokespeople. Suddenly we get lumped into certain categories with 
other bands. Like now, since we both get played on alternative radio, we're the 
same kind of band as Depeche Mode. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Maybe it's your paean to Karen Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon: It's pretty sincere. Not that the song was meant to be completely 
serious, but the interest is there. Actually, y'know, those early recordings . 
. . Richard (Carpenter) was really clever the way he did all that layering and 
stuff, because there wasn't really that much audio technology. He was doing the 
things that people are doing now, and his arrangements were actually pretty 
sophisticated. Though later on they got cheesy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So Karen Carpenter is your Madonna of this year? 
</P>
<P>
Gordon: She's our Madonna of all time.

RAMS: FORMER UCLA STAR REPEATS AMERICAN BOWL SUCCESS BY RUSHING FOR 115 YARDS 
IN 19-3 VICTORY OVER CHIEFS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Put Gaston Green on another continent and watch him go. It was sayonara in last 
year's exhibition opener in Japan and auf wiedersehen here Saturday as Green 
led the Rams to a 19-3 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in American Bowl '90 
before 55,429 at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Green rushed for 115 yards in 21 carries, earning him the game's most valuable 
player award for the second consecutive summer. He took a similar trophy and 
assorted prizes in last year's game at Tokyo after a 116-yard performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we can get the regular-season games over here," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Green is a star in two languages, neither of them English. Except for two 
flashes in foreign lands, Green's pro career has been a disappointment. He has 
gained more yards in two American Bowl exhibitions, 231, than in two complete 
regular seasons, 190, after being selected as the 13th pick in the 1988 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Green is fighting for his football life in a three-way tailback battle with 
Cleveland Gary and Curt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Gary sat out Saturday's game with a lower back strain, and Warner carried only 
five times for 12 yards, opening an opportunity for Green. Last season with 
such a chance, he might have tripped at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Chiefs, Green had runs of 30 and 25 yards, his longest since, yes, 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I hadn't done it in so long, I almost forgot how to move out there," 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Green said all he wants is a fair chance to win the job. And he thinks he'll 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel like I'm going to get a chance to play a lot, because we really 
don't have anyone that's been playing here that long," he said. "There's myself 
and Cleveland, we didn't play that much last year. And Curt, he's been in the 
league and been a great back, but he has to learn the offense, too, so I think 
it's up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have been talking all summer about the new-and-improved Green, a 
player who came to camp knowing he had to win a job. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett said he has noticed the change in Green since 
mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed very focused at the time, wanting to do the right thing," Everett 
said. "In the passing game, he's 10 times better, and the running game speaks 
for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, it remains to be seen whether Green can keep this up in games not 
needing interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
Green's two longest runs came in the second half when it was substitutes 
against substitutes, never the perfect environment for conclusive evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
"But it isn't just the 115 yards," Coach John Robinson said. "That's not the 
point. It's the way he ran, the way he's hitting the holes. He's not ever going 
to be a power back, but he's certainly quick in the hole. He was very 
impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, so were the Ram starters in their brief appearances. Everett played 
only the first quarter but looked sharp on his first drive, completing four of 
five passes for 34 yards. He finished seven of 10 for 56 yards and one 
touchdown, a six-yard scoring pass to Buford McGee with 3:48 left to give his 
team a lead it would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
Other summer stories that began to take form Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alfred Jackson. The second-year cornerback from San Diego State, who is 
being asked to grow up in a hurry this season, made his first start in the NFL 
and had two interceptions, the second going for 31 yards and a touchdown late 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
They were Jackson's first two interceptions since high school, if you can 
believe it. Jackson played receiver in college and was converted by the Rams 
after they took him in the fifth round last season. So far so good. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he's still not completely comfortable on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I still feel like a receiver when I'm going for the ball," he said. 
"Instead of playing the receiver, it seems like there's times that I'm the 
receiver. That's something I'm just used to." 
</P>
<P>
Is that so bad? Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
"I can catch like a receiver," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Bethune. With Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene holding out, Bethune 
has a chance to be noticed, a situation he isn't comfortable talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Like Greene, Bethune, from the University of Alabama, was a middle-round draft 
pick who is merely trying to make good. Greene was a fifth-round choice in 
1985; Bethune a seventh-round choice last season. Bethune looks up to Greene 
and respects his right to fight for a competitive salary. Bethune is not after 
Greene's job. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of those things you don't want to get into," he said. "It's a 
sticky situation. Kevin is a great outside linebacker, he's one of the best in 
the league. I don't see myself as taking his spot. I just see me as trying to 
find me a spot." 
</P>
<P>
For exhibition starters, though, Bethune recorded two sacks for 15 yards in 
Greene's place. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterbacks. Mark Herrmann, seemingly fighting for a roster spot, opened 
the second quarter and got to work with some starters. He responded by 
completing five of six passes for 59 yards. Chuck Long, who will switch roles 
with Herrmann next week against San Diego, was left to fend with the reserves, 
not the easiest of chores for a former NFL starter. 
</P>
<P>
Long started slowly and warmed up a bit, completing two of seven passes for 30 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm just doing what they want me to do," Long said. "Don't forget, I 
was traded in the off-season (from Detroit), so I'm rebuilding my career." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Punter Hank Ilesic, fighting with rookie Kent Elmore for a roster spot, 
strained his left hamstring on his first punt as a Ram in the first quarter. 
Ilesic said he suffered the strain when he bent over to pick up a low snap. 
Ilesic doesn't think the injury is serious. . . . Saturday's crowd was a 
pleasant surprise to NFL officials, who feared the worst after Friday's rain 
showers. But when the sun came out Saturday morning, so did the fans. "We sold 
15,000 tickets in the last 24 hours," league spokesman Joe Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' Henry Ellard, Cleveland Gary, Alvin Wright, Darryl Henley, Anthony 
Sargent, Jim Price and Lupe Sanchez did not dress because of injuries. . . . 
Last year's NFL rushing champion, Christian Okoye, had only 12 yards in two 
carries for Kansas City. Mike Elkins started at quarterback for the Chiefs and 
completed five of eight passes for 51 yards and two interceptions. Steve 
Pelluer played the second half and completed 10 of 14 passes for 100 yards and 
two interceptions. . . . The Rams are 3-0 in American Bowl games. . . . More 
Gaston Green: After winning the MVP in last year's game in Japan, he was 
presented with a video cassette recorder. He didn't know what he was getting 
this time. "I wish it was a Volvo," he said.

MEDICATION CAN BE BITTER PILL; 
</P>
<P>
THE EASLEY CASE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE ABUSE OF OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS. THE 
DANGER IS THAT SUCH ABUSE CAN HAVE UNKNOWING VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Filed away in the vast, sterile Rockville, Md., complex of the Food and Drug 
Administration are reams of physician reports on the effects of drugs. They are 
stored in cabinets or on computer disks. 
</P>
<P>
These are the Form 1639s, Adverse Reaction Reports. They are perhaps the most 
detailed evidence available about the hazards of pharmaceuticals, from aspirin 
to zinc oxide. 
</P>
<P>
One area is reserved for products that have ibuprofen, a painkiller categorized 
as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The analgesic can be found 
in such familiar pain relievers as Advil, Medipren, Motrin and Nuprin. 
</P>
<P>
The reports under this category document side-effects of ibuprofen products, 
which command about 20% of the painkiller market. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the most celebrated examples of alleged risks is not among the 
volumes in the FDA conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an oversight. Physicians have enough paper to shuffle without 
recording every drug side-effect they encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the case of one-time Seattle Seahawk star Kenny Easley reminds consumers 
of the dangers of taking medications that become household products. 
</P>
<P>
Easley was a five-time Pro Bowl safety for the Seahawks, and was once voted NFL 
defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Today, his football career is over, the result of kidney failure he claims in a 
lawsuit began with taking four tablets of Advil to help reduce swelling in an 
injured ankle. He said he subsequently took from 16 to 20 tablets of Advil 
daily for at least three months before a doctor told him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Borchardt, a retired Seahawk lineman, said players would take as much 
medication as necessary to numb their pain. He said the Seahawk training room 
has large dispensers or boxes of Advil, Tylenol and other nonprescription 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not even passed out, they're just available," Borchardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Borchardt said the players were less concerned with warnings on labels than 
feeling good enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, there is tremendous pressure to win," he said. "When you're looking 
at a Kenny Easley, he is an integral part of winning. But to have an athlete's 
health compromised is inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Although his kidney problems began sometime in 1986, Easley contends that he 
did not know of the seriousness of the disease until April 1988 when the 
Seahawks traded him to the Phoenix Cardinals. While administering a routine 
physical examination, Phoenix doctors discovered the kidney disorder. 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Easley contends that Advil caused kidney deterioration, a 
claim that has some medical credibility. 
</P>
<P>
The questions of who suggested Easley take so many tablets and how he was 
monitored once he took them will be central to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a grievous example of a lack of professionalism on the part of 
the doctors and a fairly uncaring position by the drug manufacturer on 
disclosing what the potential side-effects are," said Fred Zeder, Easley's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Palm, a lawyer representing two of three doctors who are defendants, 
denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"With regards to neglect, our defense in the matter is that the physicians 
never told Kenny to take 16 Advil a day or any Advil," Palm said. "This is not 
a case of doctors failing to monitor him for something they told him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Easley has testified in one deposition that he quit taking Advil in September, 
but the defendants claim it was in July. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors expected his condition to reverse itself when he stopped taking the 
drug, as research has shown usually happens. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Easley did not improve. He suffered from a condition called idiopathic 
nephrotic syndrome -- unknown kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is certainly this is tragic, but it is not anything the doctors 
did or failed to do," Palm said. "We don't think it had anything to do with 
Advil either." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest issue is one that concerns every household -- the safe use 
of Advil and other ibuprofen products. 
</P>
<P>
The link between ibuprofen and kidney failure is inconclusive, an FDA doctor 
said. But the evidence is strong enough to worry some kidney specialists. 
</P>
<P>
One of the latest studies at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore 
found that 25% of the patients suffered from acute kidney failure when taking 
ibuprofen. The condition was reversed when the patients stopped the drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 patients in the study all had pre-existing conditions that would lead to 
kidney failure with ibuprofen treatment, a fact that skews the study, the FDA's 
John Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
Another study at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences 
showed that ibuprofen can cause kidney failure in individuals who have health 
problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease and pre-existing kidney 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Advil label warns consumers not to take more than six tablets in a 24-hour 
period without consulting a physician. 
</P>
<P>
As with most drugs, mega-doses can be hazardous. Ibuprofen interferes with the 
body's production of prostaglandin, a hormone or hormone-like substance 
involved in inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
As ibuprofen reduces the production of prostaglandin, it obstructs blood flow 
throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
For most people, this does not present a risk. But for those who already have 
reduced blood flow to the kidneys, such a factor could result in kidney 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
William L. Henrich, a kidney specialist at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical School in Dallas, has long advocated care in the blanket use of 
ibuprofen. 
</P>
<P>
The drug was approved as an over-the-counter pain reliever six years ago. It 
still is prescribed by physicians in higher dosages. Ibuprofen is one of three 
nonprescription pain relievers. The others are aspirin and acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
Harter, an FDA physician, said ibuprofen causes fewer gastrointestinal tract 
problems than aspirin. He said acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver. 
</P>
<P>
"But the biggest advantage is that ibuprofen is much safer to have in your 
medicine chest if a 2-year-old gets into it and starts eating it," he said. 
"It's not as toxic on children." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Henrich led members of the National Kidney Foundation to protest 
dispensing of ibuprofen as a nonprescription drug without detailed warnings. 
</P>
<P>
They recommended that the FDA alert consumers not to take the medication 
without physician supervision under certain conditions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those allergic to aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those under a physician's care for asthma or stomach problems. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those with heart disease, high blood pressure, liver disease or kidney 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those older than 65. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those using diuretics. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognized that the risk of incurring kidney failure is low," Henrich said. 
"But even a low incident rate translates into a fair number of people because 
so many are taking it." 
</P>
<P>
Henrich said the best way to safeguard against public misunderstanding was to 
have explicit warnings on each label. Others disagreed, claiming that too 
detailed a label would further confuse consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA adopted the second course of action. 
</P>
<P>
Harter said when specific medical information was given in a test of labels, 
people made specific medical decisions that were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who takes mega-doses of a drug without realizing there is a potential 
risk when the label says don't take more than six times a day . . . I don't 
think we can protect the public against that sort of thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henrich disagrees. He is concerned with the public perception that all 
over-the-counter medications are safe because they are federally approved. But 
he said as more powerful drugs become available, it becomes necessary for the 
buyer to understand labels. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an education problem," he said. "I believe the public thinks because 
they can take this with impunity, they can take it with little risk -- and that 
is a misconception." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IBUPROFEN 
</P>
<P>
What it is and what it does 
</P>
<P>
* The anti-inflammatory effect of ibuprofen helps reduce joint pain and 
stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
* Ibuprofen is used in the treatment of headaches, menstrual pain, muscle pain 
and in certain arthritis cases. 
</P>
<P>
* The analgesic can be purchased over-the-counter under product names such as 
Advil, Medipren, Motrin and Nuprin. 
</P>
<P>
* A label on Advil boxes warns consumers not to take more than six tablets in a 
24-hour period. It also warns not to take the drug for more than 10 consecutive 
days, and to consult a physician if problems occur. 
</P>
<P>
* Common side-effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and heartburn, 
according to the American Medical Assn. Encyclopedia of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
* Studies show that excessive dosages of painkillers can cause kidney damage. 
But small dosages of ibuprofen might affect the kidneys in some people. The 
National Kidney Foundation identifies high-risk groups as those allergic to 
aspirin; those under a physician's care for asthma or stomach problems; those 
with heart disease, high blood pressure, liver disease or kidney disease; those 
older than 65 and those using diuretics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE LAWSUIT AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
* Easley's attorneys filed suit in King County Superior Court in Seattle last 
year seeking unspecified damages for loss of income, medical costs and 
permanent disability. The suit is scheduled to be tried in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* Easley is suing the Seattle Seahawks, the team trainer, three physicians who 
treated him and Whitehall Laboratories, Inc., of New York. Whitehall is the 
distributor of Advil, a popular pain reliever that contains ibuprofen. Two of 
the doctors, Pierce Scranton and James Thrombold, are contracted by the 
Seahawks to handle team physical examinations and treat players. 
</P>
<P>
* In a complaint, Easley alleges that his kidney trouble was the result of 
large dosages of Advil, which he claims he started using at the suggestion of 
Seahawk trainer James Whitesel after ankle surgery in March of 1986. Easley 
claims he was handed four tablets in the training room and told to take them 
any time his ankle bothered him. He said he took from 16 to 20 tablets from 
late April through July. 
</P>
<P>
* Easley claims he was not informed in 1986 of his kidney problem, diagnosed as 
idopathic nephrotic syndrome, or unknown kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
* Easley contends in the complaint that he was given medical clearance to play 
through the 1987 season despite the condition. 
</P>
<P>
* In separate answers to the complaint, the six defendants deny the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
* Seahawk attorneys are confident the team will be dismissed as a defendant in 
a September summary meeting. They claim as an employer the Seahawks are not 
responsible for an employee's health. 
</P>
<P>
* An attorney representing Scranton, an orthopedist, and Thrombold, an 
internist, said the physicians never prescribed Advil for Easley. Gerald Palm, 
a Seattle lawyer, said the team physicians cleared Easley but did not know of 
his kidney problems because Easley barred them and the Seahawks from such 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
* An attorney representing Dr. Gerald Pendras, who performed a biopsy on 
Easley's kidneys in February of 1987, would not comment on the case. In the 
complaint, Pendras is accused of neglect for failing to advise Easley of 
potential kidney failure and clearing him to play during the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
* Whitehall's attorney, Kathy Cochran, said she has been instructed not to 
comment on the case. But Frank Woodside, a physician who practices medical law, 
said citing drug manufacturers in such cases is common and often invalid.

MORNING BRIEFING: VIEW FROM PRISON WINDOW INSPIRED GOLFER'S COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Nissenbaum, 40, qualified last week for the U.S. Amateur golf tournament 
starting in Denver Aug. 21. He last qualified for it in 1970, a year after he 
quit the University of Iowa's golf team. 
</P>
<P>
Nissenbaum says his comeback was inspired by his view from Allenwood federal 
prison in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Springfield, Mass., Union-News: "I could see a golf course through 
the windows." 
</P>
<P>
Nissenbaum was released in 1987 after having been convicted for his role in a 
1980 smuggling operation off the coast of Maine that federal authorities said 
involved 21 tons of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Add Nissenbaum: The former Massachusetts high school champion said that since 
his release, he has been playing golf less and enjoying it more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take it as seriously now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In golf, what is an albatross? 
</P>
<P>
Four-wheeled frolic: Ontario's Eddie Lawson and his team manager, Kenny 
Roberts, in Anderstorp, Sweden, for today's Swedish Grand Prix motorcycle race, 
were fined for speeding Friday as they drove to the race course in rented cars. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, clocked by local police at 100 m.p.h., easily out-dueled Roberts, who 
reached only 83 m.p.h. in the same 56-m.p.h. (100 kilometers) zone. Lawson's 
fine was the equivalent of $171, Lawson's $137. 
</P>
<P>
Perfessorial logic: Joe Gergen of Newsday, in a column on the New York Mets' 
fielding troubles, recalled a remark by Casey Stengel, who finished his 25-year 
managerial career with his stint as the Mets' first manager from 1962-65. 
</P>
<P>
After the Mets had made Hobie Landrith the first choice in the expansion draft, 
Stengel said: "If you don't have a catcher, you have a lot of passed balls." 
</P>
<P>
Dome the country: The Associated Press reported that a Japanese baseball game 
in the Tokyo Dome was postponed because of rain Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanshin Tigers were unable to travel to their game with the Yomiuri Giants 
when typhoon Winona dumped heavy rain on central Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation was the first of its kind since Japan's only domed stadium 
opened in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle this: Before last season, San Francisco 49er tackle Bubba Paris' weight 
problem kept him in former coach Bill Walsh's doghouse. Walsh is gone, but 
Paris' problem persists. 
</P>
<P>
This year, though, he lost 37 pounds between the 49ers' mini-camp in May and 
the opening of training camp in late July. 
</P>
<P>
Said Paris: "I'm just now getting from where I looked like a whale to where I 
look like a normal fat human being." 
</P>
<P>
Jury of his peer: From Tom Whitfield of the Atlanta Journal: The Aug. 9, 1976 
issue of Sports Illustrated carried this remark: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really proud of the fact that I'm as good a pitcher as he is, maybe 
better. You look at a guy like him and you think he's a little foolish. He 
always makes the same mistakes. He fools around and gets behind, then has to 
come in with his fastball. Everybody knows it and can wait for it." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker was Al Fitzmorris of Kansas City, whose record from 1969-78 was 
77-59 with the Royals and Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzmorris was talking about Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about grousing: From Maev Kennedy of the Guardian: "When the English 
grouse shooting season officially opens Monday, the Hunt Saboteurs Assn. 
expects more than 500 of its members to be standing in front of guns. 
</P>
<P>
"The action is planned for several days and also includes 'dawn beat lines' to 
clear moors of grouse in Wales, the Northwest, the Northeast, Yorkshire and 
Scotland before shooters arrive." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: A double eagle. 
</P>

director, on Arkansas' leaving the Southwest Conference for the Southeastern

A BLACK-AND-WHITE ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE MOST SPORTS HAVE INCREASING MINORITY PARTICIPATION, PROFESSIONAL GOLF'S 
IS DECLINING AND ITS FUTURE OFFERS LITTLE HOPE FOR MINORITIES TO MAKE MARK 
</P>

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he was 2, Frederick Chew III was given a set of miniature golf clubs and 
plastic balls. The back yard became his driving range, the living room rug his 
putting green. 
</P>
<P>
Chew, a small, delicate child, whacked each ball until it was lost. That done, 
he started hitting marbles. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 5, Chew, using a set of mix-and-match clubs bought at the local 
Goodwill for $3 and cut down at a hardware store, finished last in his first 
tournament. His mother bought him a trophy anyway, the better to ease his hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But no trophy could compensate for the confusion and pain he felt three years 
later while attending a tournament at a Northern California country club. An 
accomplished junior golfer by then, Chew was delivered a piece of freshly 
sliced watermelon as he stood in the pro shop of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, Chew knew its chilling message: Blacks weren't welcome. He wasn't 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Chew, now a sophomore at the University of Arizona and one of only two black 
Division I golfers, was forever touched by the incident and others like it. He 
has had a black cat set near him, been denied access to clubhouses and found 
his photograph mysteriously missing from the wall of champions of a prestigious 
juniors tournament. When invited to junior golf competitions, it isn't unusual 
for Chew to be the only black in the playing field or, for that matter, on the 
premises. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf is still an old boy's sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And sadly it appears, a sport still riddled with prejudice, exclusionary 
policies, hypocrisy, a form of economic bias and, said Chew, infected by "a 
sense of isolationism." 
</P>
<P>
The recent controversy at Shoal Creek (or "Soul Creek," as several touring pros 
are calling it) exposed the game's most glaring problem: its steadfast 
reluctance to adequately address the future of minorities, specifically blacks, 
in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Hall Thompson, the Shoal Creek founder who said the club wouldn't be forced 
into accepting blacks as members, didn't invent the debate, as much as he 
revived it. Thompson merely awakened a sleeping giant, the R-word -- racism. 
Conveniently ignored for years by the PGA Tour, the Professional Golfers' Assn. 
of America, the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. and the United States Golf 
Assn., it is now an issue not easily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"(Racism is) still here in force," said Lee Elder, the black to break the color 
barrier at the Masters, in 1975. "No doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rose Elder, Lee's wife and director of the Elder Sports Management and 
Instructional Institute in Washington, D.C., puts it bluntly enough: "(Golf) is 
the last area that they don't want minorities in." 
</P>
<P>
For decades, blacks have worked to gain a foothold in a sport whose 
infrastructure, the evidence suggests, favors affluent whites. For their 
efforts, noteworthy as they may be, only two blacks -- Calvin Peete and Jim 
Thorpe -- are on the regular PGA Tour and only five blacks -- Charlie Sifford, 
Rafe Botts, Charlie Owens, Jim Dent and Elder -- are members of the PGA Senior 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Compare those numbers to the findings of a recent National Golf Foundation 
study. According to the NGF's 1989 figures, 692,000 golfers, or nearly 3% of 
the entire U.S. golf population of 24.7 million, are black. Just three years 
earlier, the number of black golfers was about half that, 384,000. 
</P>
<P>
Also important is the increase of first-time black golfers, from 36,000 in 
1986, to 137,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, noted Elder, there are fewer professional black golfers on the various 
tours today than there were 20 years ago. And no reinforcements in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (black) youth is a dying breed as far as golf is concerned," he said. "I 
see none on the horizon. I don't think a generation (of blacks) has been lost, 
but it's certainly in a position to be lost if we don't do something to enhance 
the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnny Miller, one of the few players on the tour willing to discuss the 
issue: 
</P>
<P>
"The future for the black player . . . is growing dimmer. There was a time when 
you looked at a Charlie Sifford and said, 'Wow, how did this guy make it? How'd 
he get to the tour?' The same goes for guys like Calvin Peete. He's helped a 
lot. But who's the guy who's going to replace him? It would be nice to pull for 
someone, but who are you going to pull for? The future doesn't look that bright 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Golf in itself is color blind. The course is the opponent, nothing more. The 
score card becomes the great equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
"The wonderful thing about golf is that you can be 15 years old, from Harlem, 
and if you post four straight 67s, you're the U.S. Open champion," Miller said. 
"The scores do the talking for you." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Lee Trevino, a Mexican-American, came from nowhere to challenge for 
the U.S. Open title. The following year, he won it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted Lee Trevino there," Miller said. "But because of the scoring 
system, it's totally unprejudiced." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, when Elder won the Monsanto Open, organizers of the Masters had no 
choice but to invite him to its own tournament the next year, thus ending a 
color barrier established in 1934. Again, the power of the score card. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these admirable accomplishments, blacks say they are more concerned 
about the inequities at the other end of golf's spectrum. Success on the tour 
is important, even symbolic, they say, but long-term efforts should be directed 
at improving minority participation in entry-level golf, in junior golf 
competition and in Division I college programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get started early enough in golf," said Lyman Foster, coach of the 
South Carolina State team, one of only a few quality black collegiate golf 
programs in the country. "For most black kids, we don't have the 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jackson State Coach Eddie Payton, whose team recently won the National 
Minority College Golf Championship in Cleveland: "The young black golfer is 
systematically excluded from the process where he could gain experience. He's 
fighting uphill the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Economics is an obvious reason why more blacks aren't involved in the game. 
Golf requires a financial commitment not always available to those interested 
in playing. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the Center for the Study of Sport in Society 
at Northeastern University, the median income of black families is 40% less 
than that of white families. Given the assorted costs of the game -- greens 
fees, lessons, golf bag, clubs, shoes, balls -- the disparity in income is 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of kids, even white kids, it's expensive, ridiculously expensive," 
Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
Chew and his mother, who moved to Oakland when he was 7, have had to struggle 
for everything. Betty Chew manages a counseling office for an Oakland nonprofit 
organization. Her salary is modest, not even enough to establish a line of a 
credit at a bank. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, when it came time to buy a set of clubs for her son, she would 
visit a thrift store, have the shafts shortened at a hardware shop and hope for 
the best. Sometimes Frederick Chew would have to settle for women's clubs. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, a local club professional might give Chew a hand-me-down driver or 
a discarded putter. But to pay, say, nearly $900 for a set of Ping irons would 
be unthinkable for the Chews. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is also chairman of the Utah Junior Golf Assn., said the overall 
situation is likely to worsen, thus squeezing more minorities out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless your dad is rich," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Stills' father wasn't rich, but he did see to it that his son learned 
the game, whatever the financial hardship. Playing on the municipal courses of 
Pensacola, Fla., where Elder won that Monsanto Open, Adrian Stills earned a 
golf scholarship to South Carolina State and played one year on the PGA Tour 
before losing his card in 1987. He now plays on the Florida mini-tour. 
</P>
<P>
Stills attended the National Minority tournament and came away impressed by the 
swings of several young black golfers. At the same time, however, he said the 
odds of a black golfer's moving up the sport's ladder are decreased by 
financial constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of sport where certain things need to happen in order for a 
person to participate in it and excel at it," he said. "You've got to have a 
place to play, specialized instruction, good equipment. Now sure, with Calvin 
and Lee it's true that neither one of them has a textbook golf swing, and they 
never had any of those luxuries I talked about. But there's no question that 
those disadvantages are very hard to overcome if you're not white." 
</P>
<P>
The need to develop a grass-roots foundation for minority golf has been Eddie 
Payton's goal ever since he returned to his alma mater four years ago. Payton, 
who played in the National Football League and is the brother of running back 
Walter Payton, accepted the $4,000-a-year Jackson State job when it became 
apparent the program might be terminated if a coach wasn't found. Since then, 
Eddie Payton has developed something of a minority golf powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the financial demands of golf, but also said that the game 
could become more accessible if everyone, including blacks, accepted partial 
blame for the problem and worked together to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
"You think about the average black kid you see," Payton said. "He might be 6 
years old and wearing designer jeans and a pair of Air Jordans (basketball 
shoes). The Air Jordans got to cost $100. A set of golf clubs cost $150. Now if 
we take a kid at 6, invest in some golf clubs and invest some time in him, who 
knows what could happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Payton even questioned the actions of his brother's agents, as well as those of 
Jordan's. Both Walter Payton and Jordan are avid golfers and, according to 
Eddie Payton, would make ideal role models for young blacks interested in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"But (the advisers) won't allow them to take the time to do things for minority 
golf," Eddie Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
Also accountable are the various national golf organizations. The PGA Tour 
contributed $19.8 million to charities in 1989, but spokesperson Sid Wilson 
said he didn't know exactly how much of that money was funneled into junior 
programs, and how many of those junior programs were aimed at minority golfers. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA of America proudly lists six programs designed to introduce or further 
expose children to golf. But at least two of the programs -- the PGA Junior 
Golf School, which requires a $960 fee, excluding transportation; and Junior 
Medalist Golf -- are cost-prohibitive or too advanced for the first-time 
minority golfer. 
</P>
<P>
Another program, PGA Outreach, which is supposed to teach the benefits of 
proper nutrition, physical fitness and golf to youngsters, isn't in operation. 
It was scheduled to be implemented in San Diego area public schools this fall, 
but the program probably won't be unveiled until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining three PGA programs, although not designed specifically to reach 
beginning black golfers, do provide some important assistance. A PGA school 
development program features visits by local club pros to area public or 
private schools. Terry McSweeney of the PGA estimated that 1,100 schools and 
385,000 children participate annually in the development effort. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA First Swing program distributes beginning golf manuals to 10,000 
children a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Clubs for Kids program, with the help of corporate sponsorship, provides 
25,000 golf clubs each year to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with such programs, said Miller, is that they don't do enough. He 
used Clubs for Kids as an example. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice," he said. "But have you ever been to See's candy? If you go in 
there, they'll give you one piece. But if you don't have any money, I don't 
know where that's going to get you." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, not very far. The American Junior Golf Assn., which runs 28 
tournaments each year and whose main goal is to help players receive college 
scholarships, has about 3,000 members, about six of whom are black. 
</P>
<P>
"There really aren't a lot (of blacks) out there (playing golf)," said the 
organization's Dave Linden. "We realize that there is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Linden said his organization donates about $100,000 annually to various junior 
golf programs, but that none of it is given, for example, to inner city groups 
interested in starting a youth golf program. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Irwin, 1990 U.S. Open champion and one of 88 players on the three tours 
donating 1% of his earnings to junior golf, said more attention has to be given 
to all children interested in the game, minority or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a greater effort, not only by the (tour) players, but by the 
PGA, the USGA to indeed make available more funds for the kids," he said. "But 
it's the chicken-and-the-egg thing: You give them more funds, but where are 
they going to play?" 
</P>
<P>
Miller suggested partial community funding of junior golf and an agreement with 
local courses that would provide juniors with tee times and an initial free 
round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
Lyman Foster has pushed for discounted greens fees at area courses. 
</P>
<P>
Payton said if it were up to him, he would earmark some of the tour's 
million-dollar purses for minority golf. 
</P>
<P>
The Elders said inner-city golf programs are a must. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Stills said aspiring young black professional golfers need corporate 
sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
Those are monetary issues. The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, whose Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference helped force Shoal Creek into inviting its first black 
member and processing the application of another Birmingham black businessman, 
said the pivotal problem revolves around the sport's discriminatory practices. 
Raise the social consciousness, as well as funds, he said, and you take a step 
toward solving such things as exclusionary membership policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important . . . not to trivialize what happens in these (clubs)," 
said Lowery, national president of the SCLC. "What America does privately may 
be a more accurate measure of what we are than our public activity." 
</P>
<P>
Among the SCLC demands preceding the PGA Championship was a commitment from the 
PGA of America that it would discuss opportunities for blacks on all levels of 
the game -- recreational, competitive and occupational. According to Lowery, 
greater representation by blacks is essential. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA agreed to meet with Lowery, but made no promises about possible 
changes. And although the deal temporarily satisfied the SCLC, Lee Elder said 
it was an opportunity wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"I really, truthfully think that we sold ourselves a little too short," Elder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Elder wanted to use the planned protests as a way to gain more concessions from 
the PGA and corporate sponsors for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, whites hold every key executive position in the PGA of America, 
the PGA Tour and the LPGA. Of the 49 executives, board of directors, staff 
directors and communication-tournament staff members listed in the 1990 PGA of 
America media guide, not one is black. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same in the two other golf organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Elder's wish list of reforms is long and ambitious. But if nothing else, a 
step, however tiny, was taken by golf's powers after the Shoal Creek 
embarrassment. Elder simply wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think progress was made for blacks," he said. "At least now we have a stick 
to fight with."

<TEXT>
<P>
While sitting in the Atlanta Braves' dugout during the middle of a game in 
Houston on Aug. 3, third baseman Jim Presley was stunned to see a teammate step 
in front of him and stick out his hand. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dale Murphy. He was saying goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"Right there in the middle of the game, he shook my hand and said, 'Hey, it's 
been fun,' " Presley said. "I said, 'What did they do, trade you?' He said, 
'Yeah, I'm going to Philadelphia.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a week had passed, and Presley still talked Friday as if he didn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy was classy when he played here, and he left here the same way," Presley 
said. "He was the organization." 
</P>
<P>
And so an era ended here when Murphy, after parts of 15 seasons with the Braves 
and 17 years in the organization, finally turned the team over to the next 
star. 
</P>
<P>
But as anyone who looks at the Braves' young roster knows, nobody is close to 
filling the role left by the player who, among National League players, had the 
longest consecutive service time with one team. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can replace Murph," said his right-field replacement, Dave Justice, a 
rookie of the year candidate who did a good imitation with five home runs in 10 
at-bats after the trade. "It's like taking over for Mickey Mantle or Willie 
Mays." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who was dealt with pitching prospect Tommy Greene to the Phillies for 
reliever Jeff Parrett, outfielder Jim Vatcher and a player to be named, had to 
be traded. He was going to become a free agent at the end of the season, and 
had already privately told Brave General Manager-Manager Bobby Cox that he felt 
out of place in the team's youth movement and wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"News of the trade leaked three days before we did it, and those three days 
were some of the hardest I've been through," Cox said. "All the letters, the 
phone calls, all the criticism. Trading him was hard as a manager, and as a 
person." 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper printed numerous critical letters, such as the one from Bill 
Summers of Suwanee, Ga., which read: "(Murphy) was such a wonderful person. I 
wish he had stayed and the Braves had left town." 
</P>
<P>
Other fans responded by avoiding Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. The first home 
series after the trade, against the San Diego Padres, drew 25,373 for four 
games on three nights. 
</P>
<P>
But then, the Braves have not drawn more than 1 million fans since 1987. They 
have not finished higher than fifth place since 1984. They have not had a 
winning season since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
They have the worst record in the National League this season, and they are on 
a pace to lose 100 games for the second time in three seasons. They were going 
to lose with or without Dale Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what direction we had to go, and Murph knew what direction we had to 
go," Cox said. "And hey, even if you can't tell it now, we are headed in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants were stunned by the loss of Rick Leach, suspended for 
60 days Monday after testing positive for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Leach was more than a platoon outfielder with a .293 average in 174 at-bats. 
The former Michigan quarterback had become one of the team's vocal clubhouse 
leaders. With hard play and big talk, he fired up the Giants in the same way 
Kirk Gibson, another former Big Ten football player, fires up the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"To lose a leader and to lose a gamer, it's a big blow to the team," said first 
baseman Will Clark, Leach's closest teammate. "He had the kind of personality 
that fit right in on this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Leach, a nine-year veteran who signed with the Giants on opening day after 
failing to make the Atlanta Braves as a free agent, was undergoing drug-testing 
three or four times a week since disappearing from the Texas Rangers for 36 
hours early last season. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said he tested positive in the period July 26-29, during the Giants' 
four-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. He had five hits in 11 at-bats during 
that series, including his first two home runs, both of which helped the Giants 
score comeback victories. 
</P>
<P>
Leach has long been noted for pulling surprises. 
</P>
<P>
After the Giants broke a losing streak with a 7-2 victory at Dodger Stadium on 
July 25, Leach and Clark captivated the clubhouse by screaming playful insults 
at each other for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, rookie pitcher Rafael Novoa showed up to make his major league 
debut wearing a Michigan State sweat shirt. After Novoa pitched well, Leach 
held a ceremony during which he pulled out a sharp instrument and cut the shirt 
in half, pronouncing, "You've got a lot of guts wearing that shirt. You're a 
Giant now." 
</P>
<P>
With one swing Wednesday, Carlton Fisk made enough history for a career. 
</P>
<P>
His high fly ball down the left- field line and over the Royals Stadium fence 
was his 327th home run as a catcher, tying Johnny Bench's record. It was his 
348th overall homer, tying him with George Foster for 43rd on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
It was also his 186th homer for the Chicago White Sox, tying him with Harold 
Baines for the franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
The number that Fisk truly treasures, though, is the 72 on his back. Many have 
thought he wore the unusually high number because it was the reverse of 27, the 
number he wore with the Boston Red Sox. But Fisk recently admitted that he also 
wears it because his son, Casey, was born in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers talk about a recently traded player, a favorite expression is, 
"He didn't know how good he had it here." 
</P>
<P>
This summer that saying has proven true, and not just for the Dodgers, but also 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall, whom the Dodgers traded last winter with Alejandro Pena to the 
New York Mets for Juan Samuel, is no longer a Met, and no longer even a 
starting player. After being traded to Boston July 27 because he complained 
about sitting on the Mets' bench, Marshall, with a chronically sore back, has 
yet to play for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
He began a rehabilitation assignment this weekend at triple-A Pawtucket, but 
when he returns, there could no room in the lineup for him. After batting .239 
with six home runs and 27 runs batted in for the Mets, Marshall was essentially 
acquired as insurance in case right fielder Tom Brunansky leaves the team as a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is still with the Mets but has a 4.17 earned-run average and shares the 
right-handed setup role with rookie Julio Machado. After throwing 76 innings 
last season with a 2.13 ERA, he is complaining his 49 2/3 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, traded from the Dodgers to Oakland on May 13 for Stan Javier, 
also has a reduced role. Since returning from the disabled list on Aug. 3 -- 
after his recovery from a strained hamstring -- he has platooned with Mike 
Gallego, even though both bat right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
As if his .232 average isn't upsetting enough, Randolph hit his hardest line 
drive of the season Wednesday against Baltimore -- but it was caught by pitcher 
Jeff Ballard to begin a triple play, the first against Oakland since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The three Angels who were sent to the New York Yankees have also had problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt, sidelined earlier with a sore elbow, has appeared in 16 games, 
starting six. He's 1-4 with a 2.82 ERA. Claudell Washington is on the disabled 
list with a sprained right thumb after batting .167 in 33 games. Rich 
Monteleone, meanwhile, has yet to throw a pitch in a Yankee uniform. He is 
still at triple-A Columbus.

TENNIS SAN DIEGO TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
THIS TIME, GRAF HOLDS OFF GARRISON FINISH, 6-4, 7-5, IN SEMIFINALS

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The footsteps, once distant, are close enough to West Germany's Steffi Graf 
that she knows she's being followed. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's up to her to cover her tracks and keep the women chasing her No. 1 
tennis ranking. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon semifinal at the $225,000 Great American Bank tournament 
Saturday, Graf proved why she's still the hunted. She beat Zina Garrison of 
Houston, 6-4, 7-5, and advanced to today's 1 p.m. final at the San Diego Tennis 
&amp; Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
Graf will play fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Switzerland, who defeated 
sixth-seeded Barbara Paulus, 6-0, 4-6, 6-1, in the second semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison defeated Graf most recently at Wimbledon, but this also was a rematch 
of last year's San Diego final, which Graf won by the same score. 
</P>
<P>
She was happier this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I wasn't playing very well," said Graf, who has a 6-2 record 
against Garrison. "Today, I thought I was playing much better. I should have 
put it away at 6-4, 2-0, but still, I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
That Garrison was a player who had recently eliminated her from a Grand Slam 
event was of little concern to Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous today at all," Graf said. "My forehand's much better. I'm not 
making many mistakes anymore. I'm much more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Before a standing-room-only crowd, Graf lost a 2-0 lead in the second set and 
found herself down, 4-2 and then 5-3. But Graf held serve, broke Garrison and 
then held serve again to take a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison's chances of forcing a tiebreaker dimmed after she double-faulted and 
mis-hit a volley and then a groundstroke. They dissolved with Graf's 
cross-court backhand winner that left Garrison flat on her feet at midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I played well, but not as well as I could have," Garrison said. "I 
missed some easy shots at the end of the match that normally I don't miss. But 
Steffi kept the pressure on me." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison fought the flu early in the week and said she almost had to withdraw 
from the tournament, but she refused to make excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't blame it on that," she said. "I felt a little bit tired, but it was 
hot out there and my legs were just a little rubbery." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said Garrison has the type of game that troubles her, especially since 
Garrison's backcourt game has improved. 
</P>
<P>
"She's never an easy player to play against," Graf said. "It's the kind of game 
that's hard to get into rhythm. Lately she's been playing well, and she's not 
making the mistakes that she used to. She was shaky from the back, but she's 
gotten a lot steadier." 
</P>
<P>
With No. 2-ranked and second-seeded Martina Navratilova withdrawing Tuesday, 
thus blowing the air out of a Graf-Navratilova showdown, there was speculation 
that this match would be the real final. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow's the last match," she said. "I knew this would be a hard match, but 
it's the same for the finals. Whoever gets in the final has a high level, too." 
</P>
<P>
Graf celebrates her three-year anniversary as the world's No. 1 player Aug. 16, 
and she said it is sometimes a hard role to live with. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised by the No. 1 ranking for three years," she said. "I came in at 
18 years (old). I didn't expect to be there at that age, and not for that 
consistent time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy. It's not the tennis itself. It's the life around me that makes 
it not the easiest and sometimes not the most enjoyable. But whenever I'm back 
on the court, I enjoy it."

A ROUTINE WORKDAY FOR EDBERG

Saturday was merely another day at the office for Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"When I woke up this morning, I said to myself, 'It's back to work again,' " 
Edberg said after beating Andres Gomez, 7-5, 6-3, to advance to the final of 
the $1.3-million ATP championship at Mason, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg passed Ivan Lendl and moved into the top spot on the ATP computer with a 
victory over Michael Chang Friday in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In today's final, Edberg, a 24-year-old Swede, will meet Brad Gilbert in a 
rematch of last year's ATP final won by Gilbert, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert beat Scott Davis, 6-3, 6-4, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, ranked fifth in the world and seeded third, suffered a service break 
when he hit a forehand long at 5-5 and 30-40 in the first set. Edberg held 
serve to win the set. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg told himself to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"What I was waiting for was for him to make one or two mistakes," Edberg said. 
"I was trying to get in whenever I had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
At 3-3 in the second set, Edberg broke again when Gomez netted a drop shot. 
Edberg held serve before breaking Gomez again to clinch the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I think now he's probably mentally tougher than he was before," Gomez said. 
"He knew coming in here that if he had a good tournament he could overtake Ivan 
for No. 1. He's going to have a mental edge heading into the (U.S.) Open if it 
remains the same." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edberg: "It doesn't feel a whole lot different. But it's in your mind, you 
think about it," Edberg said. "It sort of gives you a little bit of confidence. 
You think about it when you're out there on the court and it helps you." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia survived a three-set battle at the 
net to beat third-seeded Anne Smith, 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5, and advance to the 
final of a $150,000 women's hardcourt tournament at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Novotna will play second-seeded Laura Gildemeister of Peru. Gildemeister beat 
Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Gildemeister beat Novotna earlier this year in Florida.

SWIMMING JUNIOR OLYMPICS LONG COURSE;

National Junior Olympic swimming records would seem easier to come by in a 
championship final before a roaring crowd. That's why Jason Bourland's 
performance Saturday was so unusual. 
</P>
<P>
In a lonely three-man swim-off between the preliminaries and finals of the U.S. 
Swimming Junior Olympic West to make the finals field, Bourland set the 
National Junior Olympic 50-meter freestyle mark. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 23.54 seconds at Irvine's Heritage Aquatic Complex was one-tenth 
under Doug Dickinson's 1988 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up at the scoreboard and I was so shocked I felt like passing out," 
said Bourland, whose previous best was 24.22. 
</P>
<P>
The key for the 18-year-old from Boise, Idaho, was a quick start and a 
perfectly timed stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was concerned about was winning to get into the finals," Bourland said. 
"I was mentally ready to swim." 
</P>
<P>
Bourland was mentally spent by the time the finals rolled around, but his 
afternoon effort put sprint favorite Robert Fleming of Houston on edge. 
</P>
<P>
"They woke me up at 3 o'clock to tell me about it (Bourland's record)," Fleming 
said. "My nerves were shot. I tried to play cards to settle down, but the guy 
in Lane 8 (Bourland) had me scared." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Paul Wolf was more of a concern. It took a fingertip touch 
for Fleming, 18, who took up the sport just two years ago, to beat Wolf and 
become the meet's lone triple individual event winner, adding the 100 and 200. 
Bourland finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Two swimmers won their second gold medals on the final day of the five-day 
meet. Michelle Clark of Phoenix dominated the 1,500 with a six-second victory, 
and 13-year-old Teresa Mauck of Kansas City won the 200 individual medley 
despite losing 1.2 seconds to El Cajon's Alison Terry on the backstroke leg. 
</P>
<P>
Even after passing Terry with an excellent breaststroke portion, Mauck had to 
contend with Alegra Breaux and a charging Terry on the final freestyle leg. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 25 I was trying to go as hard as I could because she (Terry) caught 
me this morning (in the preliminaries)," Mauck said. "For me, this is beyond my 
expectations, but my coach still feels I can go faster." 
</P>
<P>
Three National Junior Olympic and two National Junior Olympic West marks were 
set during the meet. The Mission Viejo Nadadores won five events, the most of 
any team. The Woodlands won four, including all three boys' relays.

GO FOR WAND WAVES AWAY ANY LAST DOUBTS

<P>
Once and for all, the issue is decided. Horse for horse and for as long as they 
both shall live, Go For Wand is a better filly than Charon. 
</P>
<P>
Go for Wand was a better filly when they met at Keeneland in the 1 1/16-mile 
Ashland Stakes in April; a better filly in June, when they met at Belmont Park 
in the Mother Goose Stakes; and a better filly by far in a one-mile, $217,600 
Alabama Stakes that was essentially a match race Saturday at Saratoga Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
No other filly has beaten Charon, whose superiority over the remainder of the 
3-year-old filly division was illustrated by her nine-length victory last month 
in the Coaching Club American Oaks, from which Go For Wand was absent because 
of illness. The third starter Saturday, Pampered Star, won the Monmouth Oaks in 
her last start but was eased some 48 lengths behind Charon in the Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand, it appears, will be perpetually in front of Charon, and Go For 
Wand barely broke a sweat Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As Go For Wand cruised effortlessly down the backstretch, Charon's rider, Craig 
Perret, found it necessary to offer encouragement while doing little more than 
maintaining contact in the run down the backstretch. Randy Romero crouched 
motionless for more than a mile upon the broad-chested, thickly muscled Go For 
Wand before he allowed her to run approaching the three-sixteenths pole. When 
he did, she widened the margin to seven lengths with a burst of speed and 
lowered Love Sign's decade-old stakes record in the 110-year-old Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand set a moderate pace while under restraint, leading Charon in 
fractions of :24, :48 1/5 and 1:11 2/5 for six furlongs. She arrived at the 
quarter pole in 1:36 with Charon still in pursuit two lengths back. Charon 
would get no closer, however. Go For Wand, still under restraint leaving the 
quarter pole, was at the wire in 2:00 4/5 on a good track, a fifth of a second 
faster than the stakes record and less than a second off General Assembly's 
course record for 10 furlongs, set in 1979.

RIAL'S SURPRISE IN ESCONDIDO GIVES HIS JOCKEY FIRST VICTORY IN U.S.

The $81,525 Escondido Handicap didn't seem the likely spot for Jose Fernandez 
to win his first race in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old jockey, who won his share of races in his native Argentina, was 
on Rial, a 28-1 shot who hadn't come close in his three starts in this country 
and had earned only $11,520 in his 12-race career. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fernandez didn't look particularly pretty doing so, he was able to get 
the 5-year-old Family Crest horse up in the final strides to beat 7-2 third 
choice Mashkour by a head in 2:14 3/5 for the 1 3/8 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also put trainer Vince Clyne back in the winner's circle for the 
first time in ages. The man who trained, among others, Text, Visible and 
Announcer, is back in business at 76 after retiring in 1985 due to health 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Rial is one of 10 horses under his care and Clyne wasn't very surprised he was 
able to win the restricted Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"He had won a Group I in Argentina," he said. "They kind of underlooked him a 
little today. He came over here last year and ran a good race against Criminal 
Type (he finished sixth, beaten by five lengths in an allowance race Nov. 18 at 
Hollywood Park). Then, we gave him some time off to acclimate. His two races at 
Hollywood were against tough company." 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Carlos Boelcke, Rial's owner, is the main reason Clyne decided to 
return to training. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Argentina for a year and came back to training in March," he said. "I 
had to get the right horses and (Boelcke) offered me some. I have three horses 
for him here and seven others in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through interpreter Pat Valenzuela, Fernandez, who came to the United 
States 2 1/2 months ago, says he plans on remaining in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The trainer told me to take this horse back and get him to relax, relax, 
relax," he said. "He said wait until the last quarter mile, then go wide and 
give it one last run. It worked out perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Mashkour, who took the lead briefly in deep stretch, was nearly two lengths 
better than Valdali, the 8-5 favorite. Well-placed early by Eddie Delahoussaye, 
Valdali made the lead into the stretch when a hole along the rail opened up, 
but he was no match for the first two late. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to move a bit sooner than I wanted to, but when I got through on the 
inside, I thought I'd win it anyway," Delahoussaye said. "He was floundering a 
bit at the beginning. I'm not sure he liked this course. But, we had a good 
trip and I've got no real complaints." 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido also might have marked the end of the line for Great 
Communicator. The 3-1 second choice and arguably the nation's finest turf horse 
in 1988 threw in another stinker. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth in his 1990 debut last month at Hollywood Park, the 7-year-old Key To The 
Kingdom gelding was just off pacesetter Miserden for a mile, then weakened late 
to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I got beat," Ray Sibille said. "That's really all I can say. He just came up 
short. I don't know if he needs more racing or what. He just didn't have enough 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Solar Launch is proving to be an $80,000 bargain for trainer Robert Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Claimed by the optometrist-turned-horseman June 1 from Bobby Frankel, Solar 
Launch, a 3-year-old son of Sassafras, has been nothing short of brilliant in 
his two starts for Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
In his first outing for his new barn June 17, Solar Launch equaled Hollywood 
Park's record for 6 1/2 furlongs when he won by 5 1/2 lengths in 1:14 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Idle until Friday, he eclipsed Del Mar's seven-furlong record when he won the 
Real Good Deal Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths in 1:20, a tick better than Olympic 
Native went last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched the tapes of his races before I claimed him," said Marshall, who 
owns the horse in partnership with Warren Williamson, Hollywood Park's 
secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was lugging out on turns and running crazed and losing two to three 
lengths. I thought if we could correct that, it was the difference between 
winning and losing. But, it looks like he's picked up six or seven lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made an effort to get him more relaxed. Tim Reavey, the exercise rider 
who once worked Fappiano, has done a nice job. We always take him out at 5:15 
and work on keeping him happy and relaxed. He's mellow now. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes to that spot in the stretch and just accelerates. His race Friday was 
just like at Hollywood Park. The jockey (Kent Desormeaux) geared him down at 
the wire, too. Kent said he was pulling him out of the saddle the whole 
backside." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, who decided three years ago he wanted to train horses, says he'll 
keep Solar Launch, who has won on the grass, sprinting for now. "I'm going to 
nominate him to the California Cup sprint and mile turf (Nov. 3 at Oak Tree)." 
</P>

<P>
You probably can't really be prepared for the changes a baby brings. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard, of course, about deprivations of sleep and freedom. But are you 
ready to deal with the grandmothers? 
</P>
<P>
It's said that having a baby will bring a woman closer to her own mother. But 
for some women, it's the start of a new, subtle but ugly power struggle, says 
Nina Barrett, author of "I Wish Someone Had Told Me" (Fireside, $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the issues that never gets talked about in the books or 
magazine articles is how much competitive feeling comes up between mothers and 
their mothers and mothers-in-law," Barrett says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how acknowledged that Oedipal issue is for men -- men grow up and 
compete with their fathers, try to vanquish their fathers, and one sort of 
accepts that there's this passing of the torch there. With women, there's no 
comparable myth. But I would say there's probably an equal kind of tension, and 
a comparable process that takes place when you have a baby." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, who lives in suburban Chicago, interviewed women about their 
experiences in becoming a mother. Among the topics were nursing, finding child 
care, labor, the postpartum period and how babies changed marriages. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to the grandmother question, she says, "they could go on and on 
and on about that" -- although the topic made them self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them would talk about it with a sort of a sense of humor, like they 
understood that the whole thing was a little ridiculous," Barrett says. "I 
think that the modern woman feels like she has it all under control -- she 
knows that fighting with her mother-in-law is this situation-comedy thing that 
she doesn't believe she'll ever find herself doing, but here she is doing it. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"As they were describing it to me, they could tell that the issues sounded very 
petty, and it sounded ridiculous for them to be excited over them. But it 
really did matter. It really does matter who gets to decide when the baby 
starts solid foods. It's really a hot, emotional issue to a new mother." 
</P>
<P>
Infant feeding, Barrett found, is a dangerous topic. "There are all kinds of 
tensions that come out over major differences in the way our mothers raised us, 
and the way women are now told to raise their babies," she says, and the issue 
of breast-feeding is ideal for fighting it out. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound like such a big deal whether you breast-feed or bottle-feed, 
but that was the No. 1 topic people said their mothers or mothers-in-law were 
constantly trying to undermine them about, or criticize them about," Barrett 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Grandmothers' advice, she observes, "seems to spark brush fires everywhere." 
It's emotionally loaded, and it comes at a particularly tough time. "You're 
particularly vulnerable to criticism, because you don't really know what you're 
doing. You don't have the self-confidence to say, 'Look, bug off. This is the 
way I've decided to do it, so leave me alone."'

CARDINAL CATCHER ZEILE REFUSES TO BE BACKED INTO A HOT CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Torre looks at rookie Todd Zeile and sees himself 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile appreciates the comparison but says he would just as soon be Todd Zeile, 
thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
Torre was named Aug. 1 as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, the last-place 
team in the National League East. Not a bad time and place to shake things up a 
little. So Torre announced that Zeile, the Cardinals' prized first-year 
catcher, would play some third base the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Torre, perhaps not coincidentally, was a National League all-star as both a 
catcher and third baseman during an 18-year career that began in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no desire, at this point at least, to be a full-time third baseman," 
said Zeile, who attended Hart High and UCLA before signing with the Cardinals 
in 1986. "I hope I don't have to stay there long." 
</P>
<P>
His hopes have been realized -- so far. Zeile has yet to play third and Torre 
reassured him Friday that he still is the team's No. 1 catcher. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Torre is contemplating the move, in fact, has little to do with 
Zeile's catching. Third baseman Terry Pendleton won a $1.85-million contract in 
arbitration in February and likely will sign as a free agent elsewhere after 
this season. The Cardinals also have been pleased with backup catcher Tom 
Pagnozzi, who has a better arm than Zeile. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the year I struggled, but I've caught and thrown well over the 
last couple of months," said Zeile, who is batting .238 with 11 home runs. "I 
don't think I've had any problems that I know of. It's a matter of getting some 
time behind the plate, some experience." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: The only time Zeile wants to be near third base is as a 
baserunner. 
</P>
<P>
King for a day: With Eric King on the 15-day disabled list, Wayne Edwards of 
the Chicago White Sox made his first major league start Friday night in the 
second game of a doubleheader against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards (1-2), a Village Christian graduate, outpitched Nolan Ryan, going 5 2/3 
innings for the win as Chicago swept the Rangers, 5-2 and 5-1. Scott Radinsky, 
a rookie left-hander from Simi Valley High, preserved Edwards' victory by 
shutting out the Rangers over the final 1 1/3 innings to pick up his fourth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McDowell (8-6), formerly of Notre Dame High, won the opener for Chicago, 
allowing one run over seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who had a 3.32 earned-run average in 32 relief appearances, started 
throughout his minor-league career. He was 10-4 with five complete games in 19 
starts last season with Birmingham of the double-A Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Royal High graduate, has a sore right shoulder. The injury is not 
serious, according to a White Sox official, and King is scheduled to come off 
the disabled list Wednesday. The right-hander has been a major factor in the 
White Sox's success, posting an 8-4 record and 3.39 ERA in 20 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Add injuries: Milwaukee Brewers relief pitcher Chuck Crim was activated Friday 
after being sidelined 19 days because of a torn rib muscle. Crim pitched one 
inning Monday in a rehabilitation assignment at Beloit (Wis.) of the Class-A 
Midwest League and allowed two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence, Crim, a right-hander from Thousand Oaks High, is second on 
the Brewers in appearances (44) and saves (six). 
</P>
<P>
Healthy change: What could Danny Gil and Andre Ware possibly have in common? 
Gil is a Class-A catcher toiling in Boise, Ida., Ware a Heisman Trophy-winning 
quarterback holding out for a multimillion-dollar contract with the Detroit 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Both know the feeling of trying to unseat Rodney Peete, a Lion quarterback who 
played football and baseball at USC. 
</P>
<P>
As a Trojan freshman out of Poly High in 1987, Gil tried out at third base. 
That was Peete's domain, however, and Gil quickly did something that the Lions 
might ask of Ware: He changed positions. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach asked me if I wanted to play," Gil said. "I said, 'Of course,' and 
he handed me a catcher's mitt." 
</P>
<P>
Gil, 21, has been catching ever since. Drafted in the eighth round in June by 
the Angels, Gil (6-foot, 194 pounds) is doing some hitting as well at Boise. 
After 35 games, he is second on the team with a .300 batting average and 25 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Although hitting always has been Gil's strength (he batted .539 in his senior 
year at Poly), he is putting wood on the ball for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it seems easier to hit with a wood bat. It comes a little more 
naturally," said Gil, who is using a 35-inch, 33-ounce bat after using a 
34-inch, 31-ounce aluminum bat in college. "I can get it around just fine. I 
thought it would be a problem at the beginning. People said, 'Hey, that's a big 
bat. Can you get it around?' " 
</P>
<P>
His answer is reflected in his numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Add Gil: Two weeks ago, Gil faced Todd Van Poppel, the Oakland Athletics' 
first-round draft pick who signed out of high school last month for a record 
$1.2 million over three years. Van Poppel, playing for Southern Oregon, was 
making his second start as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
"He's legit," said Gil, who popped out and struck out against Van Poppel. 
"He'll be in the show pretty soon. He throws extremely hard but effortlessly. I 
was thinking, what if he really wanted to throw hard." 
</P>
<P>
He has a name: The player to be named later by the Philadelphia Phillies in 
their acquisition of Dale Murphy from the Atlanta Braves is none other than Jim 
Vatcher, the small, scrappy outfielder from Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves contemplated sending Vatcher to their triple-A team in Richmond 
(Va.), but a spot was opened on their roster when Andres Thomas was placed on 
the disabled list. Vatcher is the team's fifth outfielder behind Lonnie Smith, 
David Justice, Ron Gant and Oddibe McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
Vatcher split time between Philadelphia and Scranton-Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) of the 
triple-A International League before the trade, batting .261 in 46 at-bats for 
Philadelphia.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: REACTING TO OIL CRISIS COULD BE RISKY VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The events triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait have made big stock market 
winners out of certain energy companies. Since midyear, the seven largest oil 
stocks have gained about 13% on the average. Energy-service firms have done 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
For mutual fund investors, there are several ways to capitalize on -- or at 
least hedge against -- the possibility of higher oil prices. Lipper Analytical 
Services counts 17 natural resources funds. Virtually all have significant oil 
or gas exposure, and about half invest almost exclusively in energy stocks. 
These latter, relatively pure energy plays are about the hottest things around 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't necessarily mean you should buy one. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that energy funds and other types of "sector" portfolios carry 
above-average risks. Because they focus on a particular group of stocks, sector 
funds will tend to rise or fall with that industry, not the general market. The 
managers have fewer companies to choose from, and they usually must stay fully 
invested in the industry, regardless of the outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Sector funds also attract more short-term traders, who can cause fits for 
portfolio managers if they suddenly decide, like a bunch of lemmings, to get 
out all at once. A wave of investor redemptions can force a manager to 
liquidate stocks whether he wants to or not, and that can hurt the remaining 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
It's not uncommon for sector funds to rise or fall by 15% or more over a 
three-month span. "These aren't investments that you can buy and forget about," 
warns Stephen L. McKee, editor of the No-Load Mutual Fund Selections &amp; 
Timing newsletter in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, if you keep your eyes open, you can find broadly diversified growth 
portfolios that have taken a large weighting in energy issues. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Lindner Fund of St. Louis has about 10% of its assets in four 
large oil companies and another 30% in cash. This composition helped buffer the 
fund against the big market drops of the past two weeks. "I wouldn't rush out 
and buy oil stocks at the moment since they've run up so quickly, but the 
long-term outlook is pretty good," says Robert Lange, a portfolio manager for 
Lindner. 
</P>
<P>
However, sector funds offer one key advantage: They allow you to take a large 
stake in an industry for which you might have a strong investment conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like is that you can separate certain areas from the rest of the 
market," says Cato B. Ohrn, editor of the Sector Funds Newsletter in Escondido. 
"You know exactly what you're buying." 
</P>
<P>
And at the moment, the energy-related group is hot. With oil prices now 
hovering above $25 a barrel -- up from the $15.50 range at the end of June -- 
the prospects for many energy companies have improved substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Ohrn recommends both Financial Strategic Energy and the red-hot Fidelity Select 
Energy Service Portfolio, which has risen about 14% over the past five weeks. 
Energy-service companies build offshore platforms, assist in drilling and 
provide other types of equipment and specialized assistance to oil companies. 
They also help firms in natural gas, coal mining and related businesses. 
Leading companies include Schlumberger, McDermott International, Halliburton 
and Baker Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
The higher oil prices will greatly help energy-service firms, many of which 
were hit hard during the oil slump that started in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
So might the recent improvement in relations with the Soviet Union. "The 
Soviets are the largest producer of oil, yet they don't know how to run their 
industry," Ohrn says. He figures American energy-service firms will win 
contracts to help boost hydrocarbon output in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ohrn considers energy service one of the four most attractive 
industrial sectors for the 1990s, along with health care, telecommunications 
and pollution control. "The fundamentals are so good I don't see how you can 
miss over the next 10 years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other energy funds might hold a few service stocks, but they mostly invest in 
oil companies, especially the larger ones. There's one exception to this 
preference for oil: Rushmore American Gas Index has the unique approach of 
buying only natural gas firms, particularly those engaged in the distribution 
and transmission of the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Those natural resources funds that don't invest predominantly in energy 
nevertheless take big stakes in the industry. For example, T. Rowe Price New 
Era, the oldest and largest such fund, has about 29% of its assets in oil 
stocks, 31% in other resources companies and 13% in gold mining shares, which 
also tend to rally when oil prices head higher. "The fund is designed as a 
hedge against accelerating inflation," explains George Roche, one of New Era's 
portfolio managers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their greater diversification, natural resources funds aren't as 
volatile as pure energy portfolios. On the other hand, they haven't benefited 
as much from the spike in oil prices. New Era, for example, is up only about 1% 
since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
As yet another way to capitalize on higher oil prices, consider a closed-end 
energy fund. Closed-end portfolios are similar to mutual funds in that they 
feature professional management and diversified holdings. But they trade like 
stocks, at prices that usually don't coincide with the per-share value of the 
stocks or bonds held. In other words, closed-end funds sell at either a premium 
or discount to their net asset values. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum &amp; Resources Corp., a closed-end energy fund that trades on the 
New York Stock Exchange, has moved higher over the past few weeks. At last 
count, the fund sold at a slight 6% discount to its holdings, compared with a 
13% gap earlier this year. That indicates the fund is becoming more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many energy-related funds have surged in recent weeks, Ohrn suggests 
a "dollar cost averaging" strategy in which you purchase shares in small, fixed 
amounts spread over several months or longer. That way, you get a blending of 
prices, which should help alleviate any anxiety that you might be buying at a 
peak. Ohrn says dollar cost averaging works best for broadly diversified funds 
or long-term growth sectors -- a category that he feels describes the 
energy-service business. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, McKee doesn't recommend any energy-oriented mutual funds. "I hate 
to chase after investments, and oil has had an incredible rise lately." 
</P>
<P>
He believes gold funds offer a better way to capitalize on higher oil prices, 
rising U.S. inflation and heightened international tensions. "If the situation 
in the Persian Gulf worsens, gold will probably do better than oil," he

Lately, gold has risen about 8% from its July low near $350 an ounce, sparking

should be handled carefully. McKee cautions against placing more than 15% of 
your investment portfolio in any sector fund, and he suggests selling if prices 
start moving sharply against you.

HOT PROPERTY: BURT AND LONI MOVE BACK TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor BURT REYNOLDS, who has been living mainly on his Florida ranch since 
selling his bachelor pad in Holmby Hills last summer, has leased a newly built 
home in the Bel-Air area for a year at $40,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"He took the lease because he has a new series that is about to begin filming 
right away," said Bobbi Ward of Asher Dann &amp; Associates, who represented 
Reynolds in the lease but wouldn't divulge its value, which came from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds is the star and co-executive producer of the new fall CBS series 
"Evening Shade," about an ex-football pro who returns to his hometown to raise 
a family. 
</P>
<P>
"Burt leased the house without (his wife, actress) LONI (ANDERSON) knowing, but 
when she saw it, she loved it," Ward said. They entered a lease option for an 
additional year. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was in Italy during July for a TV remake of "Three Coins in a 
Fountain," and she will be one of a handful of hosts for "Who's Minding the 
Kids?," a week of educational, back-to-school TV programs starting Aug. 27 on 
the A&amp;E cable network. 
</P>
<P>
"Burt rented it (the house) completely furnished," Ward said, "but he put his 
own artwork in it. He has an extensive collection of fine art, but he also has 
a lot of Western art." 
</P>
<P>
The home, which she described as a gated, two-acre compound with many security 
features, has a San Fernando Valley view, swimming pool and tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
He's putting Astroturf on the tennis court, so his son Quinton, 23 months, can 
use it as a playground, and he's baby-proofing the pool, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-square-foot main house has eight bedrooms and 11 baths, including a 
guest/staff apartment with a kitchen and a living room. There is also a guest 
house. "You have to drive to that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The home also has a master suite with what Ward termed "his and hers TV sets" 
and "incredible closet space." "Loni has a black belt in shopping, according to 
Burt," Ward said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
The home was built by its owner, Jay Steinbeck, who recently constructed 15 
$1-million-plus houses in the master-planned Brentwood community of 
MountainGate. Steinbeck was represented in the lease by Linda May of Mosler, 
May, Deasy &amp; Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Model/actress/recording star ROSEANNE VELA has purchased a home off Beverly 
Glen near Mulholland Drive in an area where Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and 
Marlon Brando live. 
</P>
<P>
Vela co-stars with Nicholson in "The Two Jakes," which opens this Friday. She 
has appeared on the cover of Vogue 14 times and has recorded an album with A 
&amp; M Records, which is due out in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
She bought a white contemporary villa with French doors and a swimming pool for 
$750,000. 
</P>
<P>
She was represented by Kurt Rappaport and Chris Furie of Prudential Rodeo 
Realty. Martin Genis of Douglas Properties represented the seller. 
</P>
<P>
The Taj Mahal is on the market, but it's not the one in Agra, India. It's the 
one in the San Francisco Bay. It's a houseboat that looks like a floating Taj, 
and is the weekend home of Deborah and William Harlan. 
</P>
<P>
Docked in the Sausalito Yacht Harbor at a cost of $2,500 a month, the 
200-ton-plus houseboat is a combination of Mogul and Moorish architecture, with 
its white, slender towers, graceful arches and onion-shaped domes. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-square-foot houseboat has two domes, instead of one like the Indian 
landmark, but the cut-out fascia above its entrance was copied from a portal of 
the original Taj. The long boardwalk leading to the houseboat even resembles 
the lengthy approach to the famous mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
The houseboat also has such features as a sauna, whirlpool tub, wine cellar, 
four fireplaces, two kitchens, three bedrooms, four baths and an elevator to 
service three levels of living. 
</P>
<P>
"But its back yard is the bay, and that's why the Harlans are selling it; they 
have two little babies, and that doesn't work on a houseboat," said Mary Lou 
Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
She shares the $2.5-million listing with Debi DeCello at Pacific Union Co., a 
San Francisco residential brokerage firm that William Harlan co-founded. He is 
also co-owner of the Merryvale Vineyard in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Bel-Air mansion that the SULTAN OF BRUNEI decided not to buy in February 
because of the radon discovered there has been purchased by a member of the 
royal family of Saudi Arabia, sources not involved in the deal said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The home has 25 bedrooms in 36,000 square feet, including a guest house, 
chauffeur's and housekeeper's quarters, and a number of bedrooms under the 
tennis court, a realtor noted. 
</P>
<P>
The property had quietly been marketed at $25 million and was sold to a Saudi 
prince, just before the current Middle East crisis for slightly more than the 
sultan was going to pay for it, the sources said. The sultan had the house in 
escrow for eight months at $18.5 million before radon was discovered there. 
</P>
<P>
"The radon problem was really minor, so I'm sure it was taken care of," said a 
home inspector familiar with the house. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built five years ago on a four-acre site purchased from former 
media magnate WALTER H. ANNENBERG for $2.9 million, the realtor said. 
</P>
<P>
Before he bought the Bel-Air house, the Saudi prince had been negotiating to 
buy Merv Griffin's 157 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains, he added. That 
property is listed at $20 million with Steve Lewis of Jon Douglas Co.'s Beverly 
Hills office, but he would not comment.

APARTMENT VALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to the owner of a 10-unit apartment building who asked 
"What is the best way to determine a fair price?" (The Small Investor, July 
22). 
</P>
<P>
The advice you gave, to consult with real estate agents who specialize in 
apartments is excellent. There are numerous real estate companies that 
specialize in apartment properties in Southern California that are professional 
and knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
However, your advice to use the capitalization method of valuation is not the 
accepted practice in valuing small apartment buildings. The capitalization 
method is utilized in valuing smaller apartment buildings, but only as a check 
to the market approach or gross income multiplier method. 
</P>
<P>
Your explanation of the capitalization method left out one very important step; 
how to get from the gross annual income to the net operating income. 
Determining reasonable operation expenses would be extremely difficult for the 
novice investor. Rules of thumb or typical expenses are often misleading. To 
rely on the owner's expense statement can be very dangerous. Determining the 
appropriate capitalization rate is as difficult as determining an appropriate 
gross income multiplier. When choosing the appropriate capitalization rate or 
gross income multiplier, many factors must be considered. These include 
vacancy/collection loss, age, condition, locational features, nuisances, 
amenities, unit type and sizes, number of units, rent control, existing rent 
levels, size of units, utilities paid by owners as well as a number of other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
When comparing similar type buildings, the gross income multiplier range can 
become very narrow. You stated that "a gross multiplier should only be used to 
determine if a building might be a good buy." I would think, that if the gross 
multiplier could be used to determine a good buy, you could use that same 
technique in your valuation of apartments.

HIGHER PREMIUMS FOR WOOD ROOFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding renewed discussions about wood roofs "Fires Fan Wood-Roof Debate" 
(Aug. 5): 
</P>
<P>
I'm from West Texas, where there is nothing to burn in wildfires; however, the 
type of roof is taken care of there, fairly and equitably, by the fire 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Those wanting wood roofs must pay higher premiums, sometimes prohibitively 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Why wouldn't this work in California? Consider the burden lifted from city and 
county officials who must deal with special wood interests. It also appears 
that in California persons with fire-resistant roofs are forced to subsidize 
the wood-roof owners by paying higher premiums.

CITRUS: CAUGHT BETWEEN DWINDLING SUPPLY AND GROWING DEMAND, LEMONS HAVE RISEN 
IN PRICE. AVOID THE PROBLEM BY PLANTING YOUR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam has written garden columns and features for The Times 
since 1975. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't let the price of lemons put a squeeze on your budget -- fight back with 
your own lemon tree. According to Don Dillon, a wholesale citrus tree grower, 
lemon trees are by far the biggest sellers among the 30 citrus varieties he 
supplies to nurseries and garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of lemon trees results from two factors: the price of lemons has 
risen steadily at the supermarket over the past two years, and lemon trees are 
among the most attractive of all citrus trees when used in a landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the rise in lemon prices is simple -- supply and demand. Lemon 
groves are disappearing rapidly to make room for housing and commercial 
developments, while at the same time consumers are eating more fish and 
seafood, and also using lemons instead of salt in their diets. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape potential of lemon trees is marvelous. The trees are evergreen 
and produce pretty, fragrant blossoms and glowing yellow fruit that contrast 
nicely with the dark foliage. If you lack yard space, a dwarf or semi-dwarf 
tree will fit nicely in a small yard or large container. Lemon trees may be 
pruned or espaliered to create imaginative landscape designs. 
</P>
<P>
The home gardener can select from five lemon varieties, which range from the 
usual to the exotic. The trees vary in size from true dwarf (6 to 8 feet), 
semi-dwarf (8 to 12 feet) and standard (15 to 25 feet). Most trees sold as 
dwarf are actually semi-dwarf trees. The five varieties include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Improved Meyer. This is a highly ornamental and most productive tree. It is 
one of the few citrus trees that has natural dwarfing tendencies and does not 
require special rootstock to produce a small tree. 
</P>
<P>
The Improved Meyer lemon has an orange in its ancestry and the fruit is sweeter 
than a true lemon, but still has an excellent flavor. It is thin-skinned and 
very juicy. Improved Meyer makes a superb container tree. 
</P>
<P>
Besides of its other attributes, the Meyer lemon is more widely adapted to the 
various climatic zones of the Southland than any other variety. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eureka. A very important commercial lemon and a particularly good choice 
for coastal valleys where it produces fruit and blossoms nearly year-round. The 
exceptionally handsome tree produces medium-sized, yellow fruit with a good 
acid flavor. The Eureka is frost-sensitive and not a good choice for the colder 
inland valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lisbon. A very vigorous and highly productive tree tolerant of both cold 
and hot weather. It is a good choice for inland valley and desert areas. The 
foliage is dense and the blossoms are tinged with purple and quite attractive. 
The fruit is juicy with a great deal of acidity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ponderosa. An interesting novelty tree, this lemon-citrus hybrid produces a 
fruit that often weighs several pounds, has a thick rind and is not very juicy. 
For fruit production, Ponderosa is not a good choice. However, the small trees 
are highly ornamental. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sungold. This is a dramatic new lemon tree that would be a focal point in 
any landscape. Both the leaves and the fruit of Sungold are variegated -- the 
leaves are streaked with yellow and the fruit is streaked with green. The 
two-tone combination is most attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Sungold is a patented variation of the Eureka lemon and has similar production 
and climatic requirements. As it is a fairly new introduction, the trees may be 
scarce. Your local nursery can probably order a tree for you from a wholesale 
grower. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase only healthy, vigorous-looking trees. Avoid trees with long trunks and 
those with branches concentrated at the top. The tree should have good skirt 
branches near the soil line. If the transplant has any fruit on it, pick it off 
so that the tree's energies will be devoted to foliage production. 
</P>
<P>
The tree must be planted in a sunny area. Dig a hole twice the diameter of the 
root ball. The new tree should be set at a depth similar to its depth in the 
nursery container. Place the tree in the planting hole and make certain that 
the grafting union is about three inches above the soil line. Add time-release 
fertilizer planting tablets to the soil. Refill the planting hole with the soil 
you removed. When you are finished, make certain the tree gets a good soaking. 
</P>
<P>
In hot-sun areas, whitewash the trunk to prevent sunburn, or try wrapping it 
with trunk band. 
</P>
<P>
Newly planted trees should be watered moderately twice a week for the first 
month. Established trees should be irrigated weekly, except in the winter if 
rainfall is plentiful. Feed lemon trees with a citrus fertilizer in March and 
again in July.

<P>
HERBS GO FROM FLOWER POT TO KITCHEN POT; 
</P>
<P>
PLANTS: NOT ONLY ARE HERBS BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT, BUT USING THEM IN COOKING WILL 
ADD SPECIAL FLAVOR TO YOUR MEALS. 
</P>

Redbook magazine and is heard Sunday mornings on KGIL radio.

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the greatest joys of indoor gardening is growing herb plants. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are herbs beautiful to look at and fun to grow, but as both .ey go 
froma professional gardener and an amateur cook I can assure you there's 
nothing more rewarding than seasoning your favorite dish with a bit of oregano, 
thyme or sage that you grew yourself in your very own kitchen windowsill. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between herbs and spices? 
</P>
<P>
Well, most herbs are fleshy, succulent plants that grow in relatively temperate 
climates and whose leaves and stems can be used for culinary purposes, for 
giving off delightful fragrances, have proven curative powers or can be used as 
natural cosmetics or dyes. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs can also be dried to make beautiful wreaths or breath-taking potpourri. 
</P>
<P>
A spice, on the other hand, is generally a very aromatic part of an herb plant, 
ground from the root, fruit, flower or bark. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the plant coriander is an herb, generally known as cilantro or 
Chinese parsley, while the ground seeds of coriander are classified as a spice. 
The same with ginger -- the plant itself is an herb; the root is a spice. 
</P>
<P>
And spices prefer a more tropical environment than herbs. 
</P>
<P>
The culinary herbs, those used for flavoring food, include savory, rosemary, 
basil, dill, parsley, mint, anise, bay, chervil, chives, fennel, mustard and 
many, many more. 
</P>
<P>
They can be used either fresh or dried. Just remember that dried herbs are 
stronger than fresh herbs -- one tablespoon of fresh herbs equals one teaspoon 
of dry herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you should add fresh herbs relatively late in the cooking process so that 
you don't cook out all the subtle, delicate flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Although almost all herbs are scented, the most fragrant include bay, lavender, 
scented geraniums, lemon verbena, patchouli and tansy. Among herbs used for dye 
and color are indigo (for blue), agrimony (for yellow) and madder root (for 
red). And people have been using herbs for medicinal purposes since the 
beginning of time, such as chamomile for tea and aloe vera, applied topically, 
for rashes and burns. 
</P>
<P>
The most rewarding route toward growing your own herbs is to start them from 
seeds. You'll find a large variety of packeted herb seeds in nurseries, garden 
centers and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the directions on the seed packet, which will read something like this: 
Fill a pan or a low, wide pot with one-half commercial potting mix, one-quarter 
vermiculite and one-quarter perlite. Plant the seeds in rows about four inches 
apart and about half an inch under the soil. Keep the soil moist and in a 
bright, warm spot. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds should sprout within two weeks. As the individual plantlets reach 
heights of 3 to 4 inches, weed out the smallest, scrawniest seedlings and plant 
the strongest into individual small pots about 2 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Keep them in bright sunlight and keep the soil moist (this usually means daily 
watering). Within a few weeks you should have flourishing plantlets that are 
anywhere from six inches to a foot tall and ready to be transplanted into and 
cultivated in four-inch pots. 
</P>
<P>
As fresh herbs become more and more popular in cooking, people are also buying 
established herb plants, usually in 3- or 4-inch pots. You can find 
high-quality plants in better nurseries and garden centers in our area almost 
all year long. 
</P>
<P>
Although you can buy perennial herb plants during the fall and winter, the best 
time to buy is now, during the summer, so that they can get a good root hold in 
your house or apartment. When buying herb plants, make sure they're healthy: A 
good plant is full, bushy and free of drying leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The general rules for growing herbs indoors, to keep them thriving even during 
the winter months, are: 
</P>
<P>
Light: Herb plants need at least five hours of good sunlight a day, although 
they should be protected from direct sunlight during the hot summer months. If 
you can't provide enough natural sunlight, herbs will do very well under 
artificial lights. 
</P>
<P>
Water: Most herbs should be kept moist at all times, although some need to be 
drier than others. (See specific care instructions.) 
</P>
<P>
Soil: A regular commercial potting mix is fine, but I suggest you add a bit of 
perlite to create a lighter soil and ensure extra good drainage. 
</P>
<P>
Food: Herb plants need very little food -- a once-a-month feeding with an 8-7-6 
liquid houseplant food is plenty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvesting 
</P>
<P>
Whether you're growing your herbs for cooking, fragrance or medicinal use, 
you'll want to harvest them frequently. I'd suggest cutting a couple of inches 
off the tops every time your herb plants grow that much. This will not only 
keep you well-supplied with herbs but will help encourage bushy new growth as 
well. You can harvest herbs using scissors or by just pinching off the tops any 
time you like. 
</P>
<P>
I've tried lots of herbs indoors, but I've had the best luck with these five, 
all perennials, ensuring growth year-round: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oregano 
</P>
<P>
Almost interchangeable with another delicious perennial, sweet marjoram, 
oregano (Origanum varieties) has a slightly sharper flavor and makes a 
wonderful container plant. It grows into a shrub about two feet tall with dark, 
green, oval leaves. Oregano should be grown in full sun, kept moist, and can be 
propagated from seeds, cuttings or root division. 
</P>
<P>
Oregano is an especially good addition to dishes such as pasta, soups, salads 
and tomato-based dishes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thyme 
</P>
<P>
Thyme, Thymus varieties, (pronounced "time") is a perennial that will thrive in 
full sun when kept lightly moist in a well-drained soil. All varieties do well 
indoors, but you should clip (or harvest) your thyme plant frequently so it 
won't develop woody stems. Propagate by seed or stem cuttings. Thyme can be 
used effectively with meats, poultry, stews, sauces and soups. (I make a mean 
zucchini loaf flavored with thyme.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savory 
</P>
<P>
Among the many varieties of savory (Saturega varieties) the two most common are 
winter savory (S. montana) and summer savory (S. hortensis.) Winter savory is a 
hardy perennial that will grow almost two feet tall and will do very well on a 
bright, sunny windowsill. Summer savory is an annual that has a slightly more 
delicate flavor than winter savory but which I don't recommend you try to grow 
indoors. Both varieties have small, needle-like leaves and produce tiny, 
pinkish-white flowers. Winter savory prefers a more sandy soil than its summer 
brother and is propagated by division or root cuttings. Savory is delicious is 
salads, soups and stews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sage 
</P>
<P>
Another hardy perennial, sage (Salvia varieties) is a member of the mint 
family. Besides its culinary value, sage has long been used as a medicinal herb 
for everything from upset stomachs to baldness. In medieval times, sage was 
even thought to improve the memory. Among the many varieties of sage you'll 
find at your nursery or garden center, the showiest is the variegated s. 
"tricolor" and the most interesting (if you can find it) is s. elegans, or 
pineapple sage, whose light-green leaves have a strong pineapple aroma. Sage 
can be propagated by seed or stem cuttings and goes well with sausage, pork 
chops, vegetables or pasta sauce. The most traditional use for sage is at 
Thanksgiving, in turkey stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rosemary 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary (Rosmarinas varieties) is more woody than the average herb plant, thus 
we often see it designed as a topiary or a bonsai plant. Rosemary is said to 
alleviate headaches, heal wounds and induce sleep, but it's most prized as a 
flavorful addition to meats, soups and vegetables. And for a summer treat I 
sprinkle rosemary leaves on my homemade fruit salad. Rosemary should be kept 
away from cold drafts during the winter, and although it needs full sun, it 
should only be watered when the soil is dry. 
</P>
<P>
Using fresh herbs as flavoring can often turn a very good dish into a gourmet 
delight. But, even if you choose to dry some of the herbs you grow and harvest, 
you'll get a great deal more satisfaction from sprinkling home-grown rosemary 
into a recipe than adding the same herb from a store-bought jar. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know more about growing herbs, there are lots of excellent books 
available on the subject, ranging from "Herbs" by Emelie Tolley and Chris Mead 
(Potter: $35.00), a beautiful coffee-table tome, to the bargain of the batch, 
"Herbs -- An Illustrated Guide" (Sunset: $6.95). 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. It's time for you to join the ranks of those of us who 
have discovered the pleasure of growing our own herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you start your herbs from seeds, cuttings, or buy the plants already 
under way in 3- or 4-inch pots, good luck, happy growing, and bon appetit!

HOME WISE: DEMAND WATER HEATERS NOT A CHOICE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our earlier column on European water heating generated several questions from 
readers about on-demand water heating. 
</P>
<P>
Some readers are running out of hot water when they take a shower or when 
filling a large tub. Another reader is remodeling the bathroom and wants to get 
rid of the water tank for space reasons. Their questions: Would an on-demand 
water heater solve the problem? If so, are they compatible with any fixture? 
Are they reliable? Where can they be purchased? 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at the problems first. If you're running out of hot water, this 
could be due to a number of factors -- an element burned out (if electric), 
poorly insulated tank and pipes, high volume shower heads and water fixtures, 
and long showers. 
</P>
<P>
Before making an investment in a new water heating system, try to correct these 
problems first. They'll not only save you the cost of buying a new system, but 
reduce your utility bill each month. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still short on hot water or want to replace the water heater for 
space reasons, then an on-demand water heater might be a good choice. On-demand 
heaters are small units that heat water instantly as it passes through a heat 
exchanger on its way to the tap. 
</P>
<P>
A small unit can be mounted under the sink or on the wall next to the shower as 
a supplement to your conventional water heater. It will boost the temperature 
of the water going to the shower, allowing you to draw less from your 
conventional water tank. So the likelihood of running out of water when 
showering is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages to demand water heaters: If you've ever taken a hot shower when 
camping and had to plug the shower with quarters, chances are you were using an 
on-demand water heater. Widely used in remote areas and European countries 
where power and space is at premium, they are very reliable. They also outlive 
conventional water heaters by many years. That's because tankless water heaters 
don't store hot water inside the unit, so scaling and corrosion aren't a 
problem. They also cost 10% to 25% less to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Drawbacks to demand water heaters: As with any piece of equipment, there are 
drawbacks. On-demand water heaters are somewhat more costly to purchase than 
hot-water tanks. Even a small on-demand heater designed to supplement the 
conventional water heater will cost at least $150 to $200. Replacing the water 
heater with an on-demand heater for the whole house may run $600 to $700. Also, 
not all are compatible with the single faucet mixer valves found in many homes. 
This may require new fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still convinced it's a good idea, other considerations include 
sizing, flow rates, installation and power (electric or gas). On-demand water 
heaters are not widely available in water heater outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Every on-demand heater should be labeled with information about heating 
capacity. This is usually given in gallons of water per minute they can provide 
at a given temperature rise. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking to boost the temperature of the water from your hot water 
heater, then a temperature rise of 30 to 40 degrees at 1 to 1.5 gallons per 
minute should be adequate. Larger units replacing the water heater and serving 
the whole house would probably need at least a 60 to 70 degree temperature rise 
at a high flow rate of 2 to 3 gallons per minute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newer Plys Aim at Not Shocking You 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought a new television which has one blade wider than the other on the 
plug. Why is one blade wider? 
</P>
<P>
A: The reason you find newer electrical cords with one blade wider than the 
other is because of polarity. Polarity means that there is a "hot" or energized 
side (the thin blade) and a "return" or neutral side (the wide blade) to the 
wiring. When the appliance is plugged in, electricity flows in through the 
energized side and returns through the neutral side of the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Newer plugs have a third prong (round and centered in the plug) that acts to 
ground the appliance. In older, two-prong plugs, grounding is done through the 
neutral side of the plug. If the appliance isn't grounded correctly, the 
appliance body could conduct current. In that instance, when you touch the 
appliance, you become the ground and receive a shock. 
</P>
<P>
The neutral side of the plug has an enlarged blade to aid in correctly 
completing the circuit. Polarized plugs have been around for a number of years, 
but more manufacturers are using them now to minimize the chance of customers 
being shocked. We are aware of no adapters that will accomplish correct 
grounding easier than the enlarged plug blade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
* Are low-volume water fixtures recommended? 
</P>
<P>
* What are the flow rate and water pressure requirements for successful 
operation? 
</P>
<P>
Is there a product warranty?

<P>
* Has the product been safety tested by a nationally recognized laboratory 
(i.e., Underwriters' Laboratories)? 
</P>
<P>
* What are the maintenance requirements?

REMODELER'S DIARY: MAKING ROOM(S) FOR A THREE-GENERATION FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KENNEDY, Kennedy lives in Los Angeles with her husband, son and 
mother-in-law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've never paid much attention to categories, labels and other classifications. 
But lately the term "sandwich generation" has been gaining attention, and 
several years ago I recognized myself as a member of this newly labeled 
sociological group. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a wife, mother of a 6-year-old son and daughter-in-law of a lovely senior 
citizen who needs our care and attention. Suddenly, my role as care giver 
sandwiched between two generations demanded a solution. 
</P>
<P>
I was already a homeowner when I met my husband, Michael, in law school. My 
house suited us until the birth of our son, Joshua, when Michael's widowed 
mother, Rose, wanted to leave Connecticut to be nearer to us. 
</P>
<P>
When she arrived, Rose rented a house in Manhattan Beach, but after a lengthy 
bout with flu, we all realized it would be best if she lived with us. 
</P>
<P>
Three generations living under the same roof can present problems as well as 
rewards, so to safeguard our close relationships, we decided to add an in-law 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
My first thought was to enlarge our existing house, but Michael, a lawyer and 
real estate developer, pointed out the pitfalls of overbuilding in an area that 
wouldn't yield a good return on our remodeling investment. 
</P>
<P>
So our search began to find just the right house. I wanted a real home -- 
hardwood floors, lots of space for our son, modern kitchen and accommodations 
for Rose where her privacy would be assured. Michael's main goal was to find a 
house and land that would be a very good investment after we completed our 
remodel. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of searching for something we could afford, we found a 
1,748-square-foot house on a level double lot in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It was already an attractive 1953 ranch-style house. A one-bedroom, two-bath 
house with den, it contained lovely hardwood floors, spacious rooms, lots of 
glass and light, and a secluded back yard filled with trees and a tropical 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
There was also room to add a 1,300-square-foot addition, including an attached 
in-law suite with a separate entrance. We planned to enlarge the den and add a 
new bedroom for Joshua, a guest bedroom, and a utility room. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, Joshua and I moved into our new house in September, 1987. Our friends 
thought we were crazy to move into a house and then begin major remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael's career focuses on real estate planning and development. And I 
have been involved in space planning in my job at Universal Studios, MCA Inc. 
We were confident that planning would surmount all the horrors that remodeling 
can hold. 
</P>
<P>
One of our main objectives was to assure that the addition would blend in so 
well with the existing house that no one could tell it was an addition. 
</P>
<P>
We knew the right way to go about a remodel -- hire an architect, work with a 
licensed contractor only after checking his references with three of his former 
clients, make sure that all subcontractors have the proper licenses, bonds, and 
have them sign appropriate release forms. 
</P>
<P>
We knew all this, and instead elected to remodel the way it happens every day 
-- we acted as the owner/builders and hired an unlicensed contractor. In 
today's economy, it's prohibitively expensive to remodel according to the 
textbook. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor we selected was a talented finish carpenter who had just 
completed a major remodel for a friend of ours. His sister worked at Universal, 
and I knew his entire family. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't dare run out or do a bad job because his mother would kill him," I 
assured Michael. 
</P>
<P>
But he did run out on us several times to go fishing -- really. Overall, he and 
the subs did an excellent job for us. We had budgeted $115,000 for the remodel, 
and we were only 10% over budget because we added some extras over the course 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
We were six months late, but couldn't blame this entirely on our contractor 
since as everyone knows, the unexpected always happens when you're involved in 
major construction. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it was an earthquake. Our project was proceeding through the city 
Planning Department when the Whittier quake hit in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, our remodel was on hold for six months in the grading division 
until inspectors came to our house and we did soil tests. Fortunately, the soil 
was deemed suitable, and construction began Oct. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to remodel the kitchen first. It hadn't been touched since 1954 and 
had the original appliances. We also wanted to resurface the cabinets with oak 
to harmonize with the honey-oak floors already in place. 
</P>
<P>
Because we were living in the house, we started the remodel at the most distant 
point and delayed breaking through the outside wall (in what was then Josh's 
bedroom) as long as possible. We were spared the horrors of dust seeping 
through the house. 
</P>
<P>
The only real problem we encountered was the one occasion when rain poured 
through the wall of our sleeping 5-year-old's room. 
</P>
<P>
One major rule of remodeling is always have your contractor's home telephone 
number. We did, and at midnight he and Michael were outdoors, rigging up tarps 
to deflect the water away from a fascinated little boy's room. 
</P>
<P>
The real frustration of our project was the slow progression of the work. We 
had anticipated a completion of February, 1989. As April and then May 
approached, and the remodel was still not finished, we decided to change our 
strategy. Michael stayed home, working alongside the crew. The work pace 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
Even Joshua got involved. He'd return home from nursery school and pound nails. 
Not many children can say they've helped build their own room. 
</P>
<P>
Michael's on-site activity paid some other dividends. He was staring at the 
guest room wall in the framing stage, and noticed that a stately oak tree would 
be blocked from view. For $150 extra, a glass door was added and now our guest 
room has a secluded patio. 
</P>
<P>
Although it took three months instead of three weeks to create Josh's bedroom 
and five weeks to build the staircase leading to Rose's 650-square-foot 
combined bedroom, sitting room and bath, the results were well worth the extra 
time. The handmade staircase is really a work of art, with dove-tail joints and 
20 coats of lacquer. 
</P>
<P>
We completed the entire remodel in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Michael's favorite saying is that good, fast and cheap don't exist together in 
the real world. You're lucky if you get two out of three. We got one. 
</P>
<P>
By paying careful attention to each detail, our remodel is a top-quality, 
seamless addition that makes the house look like one flowing, harmonious whole. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is delighted with her living quarters, and the important contribution she 
adds to our lives. Josh is happy to have a grandmother to spend his afternoons 
with. Michael is satisfied that his investment will someday result in a 
handsome profit, and I'm delighted with our home.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cupping a softball behind his back with the self-assured look of a major league 
pitcher, Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry leaned slowly forward in 
front of the dunking booth set up in the tree-lined center of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The windup. The pitch. The splash. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry's well-aimed throw earned him a bull's-eye -- right in the middle of a 
picture of the frowning face of Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), an 
archconservative and renowned anti-gay legislator. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt about scoring the hit, Gentry -- the only openly gay elected 
official in Orange County -- shrugged and gave a good-natured "no comment." 
</P>
<P>
And so it went Saturday, as more than 500 people gathered for the first day of 
the second annual Orange County Gay and Lesbian Festival and Parade, held in 
UCI's sprawling Aldrich Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although a small band of men stood outside the fenced-off area in the hilly 
park shouting biblical phrases and warning participants not to enter the 
festival grounds, Saturday's festivities were without the controversy and 
violence that erupted last year and marred the county's first gay-pride 
festival in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Participants milling past the dozens of information and food booths were 
relieved that Saturday's festivities turned out more like a picnic or county 
fair than an emotionally charged brouhaha. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being forced to defend their lifestyle, many gays said they were 
pleased with the opportunity to spend the day simply seeking the fellowship of 
other gays. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is acknowledging who we are," said Gentry, who is grand 
marshal of the festival's parade scheduled for noon today, and will later have 
his turn sitting in the cage of the dunking booth. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 people are expected to show up to watch the 74-entry parade, which 
will include four floats, marching bands, local gay celebrities and singing 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day we share our experiences, we are getting stronger," Gentry said. 
"This event gives each of us the strength and self-esteem to take the masks off 
and not lead double lives." 
</P>
<P>
As participants milled around the dozens of information and food booths dotting 
the park, the sounds of country, disco and New Wave music filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
But along with the smiles, the suntanning and the Western dance lessons, 
participants said gays remain on an uphill battle for social, political and 
economic equality. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the varied informational booths -- where participants picked up flyers 
on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, alcoholism, pending gay-rights 
legislation and other issues -- were focal points. 
</P>
<P>
"Most gay and lesbian people don't know how to handle hate crimes against 
them," said John J. Duran, a gay-rights lawyer who was registering voters at 
the Eleanor Roosevelt Democratic Club booth. 
</P>
<P>
The head of Alcoholism Services for Homosexuals, who would identify herself 
only as Dorothy, said many gays face dependency problems while also agonizing 
about revealing their sexual orientation to a sometimes-hostile straight world. 
</P>
<P>
"So they hide behind a bottle," she said. "But (during rehabilitation), they 
are learning to rise up from the ashes and face who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Villa, a recovering alcoholic, said many gays became dependent on drink 
because in past years bars were major avenues for gays to meet each other. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she said, events such as the gay-pride festivals held in Orange County, 
Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego and other social activities help take the 
focus off alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"Gay bars were the only thing we had. Now we have this," Villa said as she 
watched the small groups of men and women stroll leisurely past the booth. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit group Orange County Cultural Pride was established in 1988 to 
help promote awareness about the large gay community in the county, President 
Connie Long said. After last year's festival, which was targeted by 
conservative preacher Lewis P. Sheldon, head of the Anaheim-based Traditional 
Values Coalition, the 180-member UCI Gay and Lesbian Student Union invited the 
organization to hold the festival on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to hold it yearly at UCI was formed two months before gay students 
became embroiled in a controversy over a housing policy that they complained 
discriminated against them, said junior Link Schrader, a student organizer of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
Long said the group hopes to hold the festival at UCI each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to stay," Long said. "We're going to be in Orange County. There are 
a lot of us, and we're not going to back out."

ZONING: THE LANDOWNERS ARE APPEALING ORANGE COUNTY'S APPROVAL OF THREE 
306-FOOT-HIGH TRANSMITTERS ON A FORESTED MOUNTAINTOP.

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Booth, a burly man given to blunt talk and dress cowboy boots, used to 
get fiery-eyed when he talked about his fight with county planners. 
</P>
<P>
These days he has trouble holding back the tears when he describes the dream 
home he and his late wife planned to build high in the tranquil Santa Ana 
Mountains off Black Star Canyon Road near the Riverside County border. 
</P>
<P>
Booth, 46, a city of Anaheim employee, and his wife Mea, who was 38 when she 
died of a heart attack three weeks ago, tied up most of their savings in the 
land they bought in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, unknown to them and neighboring landowners, the county's 
zoning administrator approved plans for the construction of three 306-foot 
commercial radio towers 500 feet from where Booth planned to build his house. 
Then this spring, the Planning Commission OKd a 5,000-gallon underground fuel 
tank and an electric generator for the site. 
</P>
<P>
The permit allows the transmitters, which will broadcast a new Spanish-language 
AM radio station, KSRT, to remain in position for at least eight years. Station 
owners say their Federal Communications Commission license for the last 
available radio frequency in Southern California is contingent upon finding a 
suitable antenna site, and the only one they can find is near Booth's property. 
</P>
<P>
But Booth, several other landowners and a contingent of environmentalists 
dispute that claim and charge that the decision to grant the permit was made in 
a climate of political favoritism. On Wednesday, they will appeal the permit to 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm continuing on with this because she wouldn't want me to quit," Booth said, 
referring to his late wife. "I lost my best friend, (but) I still love the 
area. The land is important to me. . . . All you hear now is the wind and the 
birds up there." 
</P>
<P>
Also expressing concerns about the tower will be a representative from 
Cleveland National Forest. Suzanne Olson, a spokeswoman for the Trabuco Ranger 
District, said forestry officials have no jurisdiction over county land but are 
worried about the tower's potential impact -- both visual and environmental -- 
on surrounding federal property. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Corey, who oversaw land-use in Cleveland National Forest until he retired 
this year, is blunter. "We would not allow that sort of thing to happen on 
national forest land," Corey said, adding that the federal parkland is one of 
Southern California's most pristine natural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a tower that's over 300 feet with flashing lights and that is painted 
garish colors is definitely not natural," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County planning officials say that they sympathize with Booth but that he is a 
victim of circumstances and the county zoning ordinances that govern their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Booth was not notified of the hearing in September, 1988, at which the Orange 
County Broadcasting Co. was first granted a permit for the towers. County 
planners say that although he bought his property four months earlier, Booth's 
name had not shown up on official tax rolls upon which the county relies for 
making notifications. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they tried to contact other landowners in the area, but 
the notices, they concede, might have been sent to outdated addresses. With no 
one objecting to the towers during several public hearings, Zoning 
Administrator Robert White said he had no basis to deny the permit. 
</P>
<P>
White also notes that a majority of the Planning Commission reviewed and 
concurred with his decision when they approved a diesel fuel generator to power 
the station last May. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Thomas Moody was the only dissenter in the 3-1 vote. 
Commissioner Roger D. Slates abstained after environmentalists contended that 
he was absent too often from the hearings to vote. 
</P>
<P>
As a concession to potential homeowners, White said, planning commissioners 
decided that the antennas would have to be moved after eight years if new homes 
were built on the adjoining land. Only one house now stands on neighboring 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the towers doubt that the antennas will ever be moved if 
construction occurs. What is more, they say, the county could face costly 
litigation if it eventually tries to force the towers off the land. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Daniel Villanueva Jr., president and part owner of Orange County 
Broadcasting Co., contends that his station will provide a service to the 
county's 400,000 Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
At Planning Commission hearings last spring, Villanueva and other company 
representatives assured Booth that the station's underground diesel fuel tank, 
which will be upstream from Booth's property, will be well fortified. They also 
contend that the towers will be compatible with the surrounding mountain peaks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's all kinds of transmissions up there," Villanueva said. "You name it, 
everybody's up on that ridge." 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials, however, restrict communication towers to five peaks so 
they are not spread out over the mountains. Further, they limit the height of 
antennas in the Trabuco area of Cleveland National Forest to 120 feet, thus 
avoiding the need for blinking red lights and brightly painted towers, which 
the Federal Aviation Administration requires for tall structures. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Olson said, new applicants are required to use propane gas rather 
than diesel fuel because it is less of a fire hazard and not as potentially 
hazardous to ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Former Orange County Planning Commissioner Shirley Grindle, who has also taken 
up Booth's cause, contends that the county can revoke the original permit for 
the towers because it was granted on the basis of misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
A map submitted with the application showed an easement for the radio facility 
on Booth's property, which he says he has never granted. In addition, the map 
does not show that a county road crosses the property precisely where the 
applicants propose to place guy wires for the towers. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle contends that the applicants have received preferential treatment 
because they are prominent Latino businessmen whose support would be important 
to the future political aspirations of Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose 
district includes the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva and his brother, James, who is also a part owner of Orange County 
Broadcasting, are the scions of Daniel Villanueva Sr., a wealthy and well-known 
Spanish-language television executive. The partnership also includes Fernando 
Niebla, a Republican political insider who owns Infotec Development Inc., the 
largest Latino business in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign disclosure records show that Infotec contributed $600 in money and 
$550 worth of help for a fund-raiser to Vasquez's 1988 supervisorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva denied that his group had received any special treatment. He 
acknowledged that the map he submitted with his application contained mistakes 
but blamed them on a consultant who prepared it and said he later corrected the 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
"We went there and filled out an application like any Joe off the street," 
Villanueva said. "To say that we are a power is grossly incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
Grindle said she met with Vasquez several weeks ago to seek his help but that 
the supervisor encouraged her to try to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed in Gaddi. I've always considered him to be fair and able 
to see both sides," Grindle said. "But the reasons he and his staff have given 
me for approving the project just don't hold water. . . . I think Gaddi has 
lost sight of the terrible injustice that's been done to the small guy." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said he has not decided yet whether he will vote for or against the 
towers, and he denied that he has played any role other than to listen to 
Grindle's concerns. He acknowledged that he discussed the permit briefly with 
Niebla at a social function, but he said he never tried to influence the 
Planning Commission's decision on the permit.

Banner Year -- The numbers are coming in on the recently concluded breeding 
season for the endangered California least tern, and 1990 shaped up as a banner 
season at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. Last season, 115 pairs of least 
terns nested there; this year, 239 total nests were counted. 
</P>
<P>
Because some birds build more than one nest for various reasons, the number of 
breeding pairs this season was probably slightly less than 239. But the most 
important number is how many successful fledglings were produced: 150, compared 
to last year's 45. 
</P>
<P>
The news on the small, gull-like bird was mixed at the Huntington State Beach 
colony. Last year, 70 pairs nested there, a number that dropped to 40 pairs 
this season. The good news is that 20 fledglings were produced, up from a 
disastrous five last season. The chicks at Huntington continued to fall prey to 
kestrels, while no predation problems were noted at Bolsa Chica this season. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated numbers for least terns at Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve 
remained relatively steady, between 60 and 70 pairs compared to last year's 74. 
About 50 fledglings are likely, according to state Fish and Game biologist 
Esther Burkett. She has not received numbers for the colony at Seal Beach 
National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I would say that we had a really, really good year," Burkett said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first season that all the least terns nested on Bolsa Chica's south 
island, having been pushed off the reserve's north island by the continuing 
success of larger tern species that have moved northward in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
At Bolsa Chica this season, counts estimate 1,000 elegant tern nests, 100 
Caspian tern nests and 100 Forster's tern nests. Black skimmers are at 295 
nests, up from 170 last year, and their breeding season continues. The breeding 
success of the skimmers comes despite the fact that many received some oil 
damage in the Feb. 7 American Trader spill off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
We're With the Band -- The state Fish and Game department is continuing to band 
many of the tern chicks that fledge at Bolsa Chica, particularly elegant tern 
and black skimmers. Chicks hatched this season have pink bands; 1989 birds have 
blue bands and 1988 birds have yellow bands. 
</P>
<P>
If you spot birds with these bands, you can help biologists by noting the date 
and location of the sighting, the number of birds with bands, the color of the 
bands and the species. Call Esther Burkett with the information: (714) 
537-0696. 
</P>
<P>
Museum News -- The Museum of Natural History and Science, which recently closed 
its doors in Newport Beach, has announced a Nov. 17 opening date for its new 
interim site in Aliso Viejo. Exhibits planned for the new facility include 
space exploration, robotic dinosaur models, local Indian artifacts and local 
marine mammal fossils.

'CAFE RACING' BIKERS ROAR OFF BEFORE DRAGNET 
</P>

The California Highway Patrol's attempt Saturday to crack down on a group of 
motorcyclists who allegedly race illegally along Ortega Highway apparently was 
spoiled because the bikers were aware of the officers' "secret" plan. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a few stray bikers, the narrow, winding highway -- normally abuzz 
with the thunderous sounds of up to 300 motorcycles on both sides of the 
Orange-Riverside county line every Saturday and Sunday, residents and police 
say -- was quiet and clear. 
</P>
<P>
For residents along the 10-mile corridor between the Lookout Roadhouse and 
Restaurant in Riverside County to the Ortega Oaks Campground and Candy Store in 
Orange County, the silence was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise from the bikes is horrendous," said El Cariso Village resident Annie 
Shurtz, who says the racket has awakened her each weekend for the past five 
years. In addition to the noise, Shurtz, a member of the village's volunteer 
Fire Department, says she has seen first-hand the destruction the racing can 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week or so we have an accident out here," she said. "Fatalities are a 
way of life on this road." 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclists who frequent the stretch in the predawn hours each weekend 
participate in a sport called "cafe racing," which originated in Europe, where 
bikers raced between the numerous cafes. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a special patrol team, made up of seven CHP officers from San Juan 
Capistrano and Rancho California, assembled at 5 a.m. to catch the cafe racers 
in action. Instead, they found the narrow, winding highway nearly barren. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few bikers there, Robert Lansens, wished he had stayed home 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Riding one of the high-tech "cafe racers" bearing the license plate "WHY LOSE," 
Lansens, 25, of Mission Viejo was pulled over and cited for an expired license 
plate, no proof of insurance and for not notifying the Department of Motor 
Vehicles that he had purchased the bike. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows it's dangerous to race," said Lansens, decked out in a full 
leather body suit, padded gloves and helmet. He conceded that more than 100 
bikers gather on the highway on weekends to "ride the curves." 
</P>
<P>
Another ticketed biker, John D. Hilton Jr. of Dana Point, seemed to sum up the 
feelings of the other motorcyclists Saturday. "We might as well just go home 
now. You guys have spoiled the fun," he said as he received a citation for 
riding without license plates and turn signals and for failing to produce proof 
of insurance.

<P>
The manager of a community swimming pool in Irvine who collapsed with a stroke 
after seeing an apparent drowning victim lying face down at the bottom of the 
pool died Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin said Mary Hatt, 45, died 
without regaining consciousness about 24 hours after suffering the stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Hatt was the on-site manager of the Village Park Recreation Center swimming 
pool, which is operated by the Village Park Homeowners Assn. in the University 
Park section of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a stroke around 4:25 p.m. Friday after Dinh Quan, 54, of Irvine 
was found lying at the bottom of the pool. He was later pronounced dead at 
College Hospital Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
As lifeguards attempted to rescue Quan, witnesses said, Hatt was excitedly 
telling about 50 swimmers to get out of the pool. She apparently began 
experiencing severe breathing and collapsed.

MIKE PENNER: NFL DOESN'T LIGHT UP BERLIN

<P>
The mystery of the missing scoreboard at Olympiastadion remains unanswered, so 
let's stick with the questions raised by Saturday's clueless affair at American 
Bowl '90. 
</P>
<P>
Was there no scoreboard because the Rams and the Chiefs made one unnecessary? 
</P>
<P>
Or did the Rams and the Chiefs stop scoring because there was nowhere to put 
the points? 
</P>
<P>
Did the American Bowl planners simply forget the scoreboard in their haste to 
provide 50,000 Germans with Scottish bagpipe bands, Orange County cheerleaders, 
American rock 'n' roll, world-champion whistlers and Frisbee-catching dogs? 
</P>
<P>
Or did we just forget that Olympiastadion is normally used for soccer, which 
has favored the one-finger method of scorekeeping for years? 
</P>
<P>
Confusion was going to reign, regardless of when the Rams and the Kansas City 
Chiefs brought the strange sport of NFL football to the Deutschland for the 
first time. But playing this new game without keeping track of points, downs, 
quarters and yards-to-go was to throw the game into a new kind of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans weren't the only ones who didn't know what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans didn't know, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't see what down it was, I didn't know what the score was," Ram 
offensive tackle Irv Pankey said. "Maybe if they start playing more football 
here, they'll do a little bit more to the stadium. At least, maybe, they'll 
keep track of what down it is and how many timeouts are left." 
</P>
<P>
Olympiastadion is equipped with a full-color video screen at its east end and a 
fine screen it is. The replays were laser sharp and brilliant, rendering U.S. 
Diamond Vision a rhinestone by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
But the screen is all video and video was on the screen at all times, for the 
benefit of the Berliners in the cheap seats. The game clock was superimposed 
onto the action but the only other numbers visible were the ones on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Matthias Theil, a Berlin college student working the game as an usher, tried to 
keep up, but soon abandoned it as hopeless. He had seen American football 
before, twice, but never without directions. 
</P>
<P>
"The game promised a lot," Theil said from a seat behind the west end zone, 
"but I'm a bit disappointed with the action because I can't get who is leading. 
It is a very complex game to understand." 
</P>
<P>
Theil admitted that he is not much of a sports fan. "Churchill said, 'The best 
sport of all is no sport at all.' That is my opinion as well," Theil explained 
with a grin. But since he was already here -- and getting paid to be here -- he 
figured, why not give it a go? 
</P>
<P>
By the third quarter, Theil had decided that he may not know football, but he 
knows what he likes. 
</P>
<P>
"One team passes and one team makes the yards step-by-step," Theil noted. "I go 
for the effort of playing with the passes. It is more beautiful to see." 
</P>
<P>
That made Theil a Ram fan. In the first half, Jim Everett and Mark Herrmann 
combined to pass 16 times, or twice as often as Kansas City quarterback Mike 
Elkins. Of course, the Chiefs didn't do much step-by-stepping, either -- 
netting 23 yards on the ground while the Rams turned one touchdown and one 
field goal into an insurmountable lead. 
</P>
<P>
Simone Fleigner, a 26-year-old woman from the East German city of Leipzig, was 
watching her first football game, most of it with a furrowed brow. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand much of what is going on," she said. "But it looks very 
nice, very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
What Fleigner liked best were the clothes -- Ram blue-and-gold clashing with 
Chief red-and-white. "I never saw such uniforms before," she said. "It is more 
like a spectacle than a game." 
</P>
<P>
Fleigner was less enamored with the grunt work of the sport. "I don't like when 
all the players jump on each other and fall over," she claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
Fleigner smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it looks like it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
While the Rams and the Chiefs did more hurting than scoring -- the game was a 
13-3 snoozer before Ram cornerback Alfred Jackson returned an interception with 
1:24 left in the fourth quarter -- German minds began to wander. They much 
preferred the leg kicks of the Ram cheerleaders, the imitation Ashley Whippets, 
the Chuck Berry tunes -- even the scourge of the American mainland, the dreaded 
Wave. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the show," said Burkard Ahlcyt from his seat above the 10-yard line. 
"The dogs, the girls, the music. This is gut. It has a lot of life." 
</P>
<P>
Theil, however, believed that it could have been better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it should be a more effective show," Theil said. "In Berlin, we have 
the (amateur) Adler team and you can see the cheerleaders more in action. Here, 
they are too far away. There is no feeling for the action from the 
cheerleaders." 
</P>
<P>
But even if they put the cheerleaders in the aisles, Theil doubts that the NFL 
game has much of a future in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"It has no chance," Theil said flatly. "It is too complex. It is a very 
strategic game, unlike German or English soccer, which is easier to understand. 
Germans like to have an easier time at their games. They do not want that much 
thinking during the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are too conservative here. Things are slow to change, especially in 
Berlin, which has been influenced by the old thinking from the GDR. I do not 
think Berlin will become a second Wembley for American football." 
</P>
<P>
But then at Wembley Stadium, they speak the same language. 
</P>
<P>
And they have a scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Fleigner, a fast learner, had already adopted one ancient Los Angeles custom 
and was heading for the exit early. Three-and-a-half quarters through one 
once-in-a-lifetime experience was more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
Would she ever consider coming back? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather go to a Pink Floyd concert," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, a Ram exhibition game in West Berlin was just another brick in the 
wall.

Jason Pedro couldn't believe his luck. 
</P>
<P>
Not only had the 22-year-old soldier received a citation for outstanding 
inspection at his U.S. Army base in Darmstadt, Germany, he'd won a ticket to 
American Bowl '90 to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in Olympiastadion before Saturday's game between the Rams and the 
Kansas City Chiefs, the former Cypress resident said he missed Orange County 
and missed the football games at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
When his commanding officer addressed him during formation recently, Pedro 
thought he might be getting a promotion. Instead, he was informed that he would 
be going to see the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
It took him eight hours on a train to get to West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to be here," said Pedro, who has been stationed in Germany 
three months. "I look forward to watching the Rams win." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro and Robert Huntly of Garden Grove were among a few hundred members of the 
military sitting near members of the Rams Booster Club in the stadium built for 
the 1936 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Huntly, 31, a first lieutenant based the past 16 months in Germany, attended 
the game with his wife, Grace, formerly of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister Jenny Kim is one of the Rams' cheerleaders," Grace Huntly said. "She 
lives in Buena Park. It's fabulous to see her." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Huntly was pleased 15 men from his battalion were able to come to West 
Berlin for the game. "I think it's a great idea to bring a little (of) America 
over here for the soldiers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Huntly readied his video camera to film the game, the boosters unpacked 
their blue-and-gold paraphernalia: pompons, horns and banners. One banner 
proclaimed, "Smile, you're in Rams country." 
</P>
<P>
"Go Rams!" yelled the boosters after queuing up to buy grilled bratwurst and 
pretzels out of straw baskets perched on milk crates. 
</P>
<P>
The boosters dress in blue and gold for Ram games. Carroll Connett wore a blue 
knit cap that featured fur Ram ears. Michael Redfearn had plopped a pompon on 
his head and topped it with a Rams' cap. But Joyce McHattie outdid them all. 
She wore gold tights, football helmet earrings and had painted Ram horns in her 
hair with gold gel. 
</P>
<P>
Amid their cheering, some boosters yelled: "Georgia! Sign the check!" 
</P>
<P>
"We want (Ram owner) Georgia (Frontiere) to sign Kevin Greene's check (renew 
his contract)," Connett said. "Kevin is an animal. Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The weather gods smiled on the Ram fans Saturday afternoon. The rain that had 
drenched the city earlier in the day cleared and a California-like blue sky 
hung over Olympiastadion. "It feels like we're in Anaheim," Ron Lais said. 
"Amazing." 
</P>
<P>
After the Ram victory, booster president Judy Matthews stood in front of the 90 
boosters and said, "This is our third American Bowl win. Maybe we should play 
all of our games out of the country."

NASA -- An Opinion article on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
by Gregg Easterbrook, published July 22, contained a factual error. 
</P>
<P>
It stated there were no accidents in the X-15 program. In fact, there was one 
fatality, in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Another paragraph, discussing James Thompson, now NASA deputy administrator, 
was factually correct but may have left an inaccurate impression. Thompson did 
not head the Marshall Space Center during the development of the solid-rocket 
boosters. He did head the center for a time when it was responsible for testing 
of the Hubble telescope.

Joyous, daft and hauntingly original, this 1986 film from David Byrne 
(pictured) is a magical mystery tour of Texas: an introduction to the imaginary 
town of Virgil and its faintly surrealistic folks, who include, most memorably, 
Swoosie Kurtz (as the Laziest Woman in the World) and John Goodman (as a lonely 
hearts bachelor).

David Lynch's superb and subtly ironic 1980 film reveals the shining humanity 
in a horribly disfigured -- and horribly mistreated -- young man (played by 
John Hurt, above, hidden almost entirely by makeup) who actually lived in 
England in the late 19th Century and was rescued by an enlightened Victorian 
physician (Anthony Hopkins).

CLIMBING TO THE TOP

Not long after California hosted the Special Olympics, CBS provided a wonderful 
hour of TV programming featuring a climb of Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Kilimanjaro by a group of developmentally disabled persons. It took great 
courage for the athletes to make that awesome climb; it also took courage for 
CBS to present "Let Me Be Brave," as well as for the sponsors who endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
The program was real, heartwarming and entertaining. It was TV at its best.

I cannot believe the stupidity of ABC! During the final round of the British

Even though I knew the afternoon telecast would not be live, it would have 
seemed that way if I didn't know the outcome.

I just wanted to say how I enjoy all the "true life" informative programs now 
on TV -- most of all "Rescue 911" -- and the rest, i.e., "Cops," "Unsolved 
Mysteries," "PrimeTime Live," "48 Hours," "America's Most Wanted," "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
I loathe the myriad of moronic sitcoms and unfortunately realize I'm in the 
minority since the networks base popularity on the inaccurate A.C. Nielsen 
ratings, which is wrong! 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I'm afraid "911" will be canceled since it seems to me the repeats 
began very early.

THE NEWSCASTER LINES UP AN INTERVIEW SHOW WITH A RAW EDGE AND ECLECTIC GUESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The most interesting dinner parties and events that I go to are the ones that 
mix up people from different worlds," said NBC newscaster Maria Shriver. "I 
don't want to go to a dinner party with just people from TV. I would love to be 
sitting at a dinner table with Lyle Alzado, Sinead O'Connor, Richard Bransen 
and Kirstie Alley. That's what I am trying to with this show." 
</P>
<P>
"This show" is "Cutting Edge with Maria Shriver," airing Tuesday at 10 p.m. on 
NBC, the first of four prime-time specials for the network. Described as "a 
spirited, fast-paced interview and magazine program, presenting stories about 
people," Tuesday's installment features interviews with hot Irish singer Sinead 
O'Connor, former football great Lyle Alzado and his attempt to return to the 
NFL at age 41, and Richard Bransen, the brains behind Virgin Records and Virgin 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, Shriver, 34, wanted "Cutting Edge" to be different from most 
interview shows. "I wanted to do a show that mixed up people from different 
worlds," she said. "I thought it would be great if you had someone from music 
next to someone from business next to someone from sports. The other goal was 
to try to simplify TV -- from that I mean to get away from the hotel set with 
flowers in the background and fancy lights and makeup." 
</P>
<P>
But Shriver discovered that's easier said than done. She learned there's a 
reason why most interviews take place in one location. "It doesn't take much 
time and it's painless for the people," she said. "We discovered that what we 
are doing takes a lot of time and patience on the part of the person we were 
doing. It's a risk for them because we hang (out) with these people." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Shriver wanted to do the program with unknowns. NBC talked her out 
of it. "Everybody said to me, 'You want to do a style that is raw and simple, 
you want to use totally unknown people. Meet us a little bit. You can't do all 
totally unknown people. You have to put in a name so people will tune in.' " 
</P>
<P>
The program does eschew lights, sets and makeup and only uses a wireless 
microphone and two cameramen. "We start rolling and only stop to change tapes," 
she said. "It's a camera-dependent show because they have to shoot all the 
time. There are cameras and mikes in the shots. There is no lighting on your 
face, no hair or makeup people. I wanted to get rid of the baggage which had 
become a part of prime-time shows." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver is already working on her next special. "The game plan is four over the 
year but game plans change," she said. "If it bombs I probably will be doing 
one more, and if it's a huge hit I probably will be doing 10 more." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing Shriver won't be doing is shuttling back and forth from her 
Pacific Palisades home to New York every weekend to anchor NBC News' "Sunday 
Today" and "NBC Nightly News Weekend Edition." Married to Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Shriver gave birth to their first child, Kathleen, in December. 
She intended to return to full-time work, but changed her mind during maternity 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I had her Dec. 13th and they (NBC) called me Jan. 2 and said 'When are you 
coming back?' I said the beginning of February and then I kept pushing it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver said she became emotionally distraught about the situation. "I wanted 
to stay (in Los Angeles)," she said. "You can't fly with a baby and then I 
thought 'What am I doing?' There was no other person before me other than Jane 
(Pauley). She had done "The Today Show," which was easier to do with a kid. You 
go to work and go home and you are not traveling. I started thinking there must 
be a way to keep my hand in here and have a kid." 
</P>
<P>
The four specials fit the bill. "I like it this way," she said. "This is 
something that keeps me mentally active. I love to create visually." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver also believes she has paved the way for other women newscasters, 
especially Connie Chung, who recently announced she was forgoing her weekly 
series in order to devote more time to having a baby. "I think that's good," 
Shriver said. "The next wave of women don't have to hem and haw." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shriver said, she vacillates back and forth about quitting working 
entirely. "I think if I start leaning more that I shouldn't be working, I have 
no qualms dropping out of it," she said. "But if someone told me I would have 
felt this way eight months ago, I would have told them 'You are a lunatic.' "

IT'S THEIR PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
AND THEY'LL CRUISE IF THEY WANT TO -- TO FRISCO'S CAR HOP DRIVE-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beckoning from another time, a neon sign glowed pink and blue, identifying 
Frisco's Car Hop Drive-In. The traffic, trying to horn in on the nostalgia, was 
fierce on the industrial stretch of Woodruff Avenue in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Music was in the air: "Runaway" by Del Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
It was not yet 6 p.m., but because this Wednesday was Cruising Night, the 
parking lot was already full of classic automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
A '56 Chevy sat next to a '57 Chevy. They competed for attention with a '67 
Cobra, a '60 Lincoln, a '56 T-Bird, a '54 Mercury, a '61 MG, a '30 Model A Ford 
(what was that doing there?) and many freshly waxed others with gaudy hood 
ornaments, elaborate grilles and prominent tail fins. 
</P>
<P>
Colors were shocking shades rarely seen on modern cars -- orange, pink, 
aquamarine and, on a shiny 1948 Ford with little oval windows, a magenta that 
matched the lipstick of Joanne Frisco Stathoulis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not crazy yet," said Stathoulis, 32, who, with her husband, Takis 
Stathoulis, owns the drive-in. "Wait till about 8:30. There will be 500 cars 
going up and down the street." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has been holding its Cruising Night for about five years, 
drawing increasing crowds as its reputation grows. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the car owners, though, did not eat in them. They roamed around and 
talked with friends they've made through this ritual. It is held on Wednesdays 
to break up the week. Thus, the carhops, who were on roller-skates, stayed 
inside the restaurant -- an attraction in itself -- and served a seated crowd 
composed largely of families. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably just as well. One carhop recalled spilling a tray on a 
cherished hot-rod. "Two chili cheeseburger specials," said Deanna McCullah, 21, 
a Cerritos College student who winced at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Accidents are rare," Stathoulis said, "but I'm surprised we haven't had more 
accidents. Believe me, it's not easy when grease or Coke gets in the wheels of 
their skates." 
</P>
<P>
The carhops -- blond, fresh-faced and carrying trays heaped with hamburgers, 
onion rings, french fries and shakes -- wheeled through a crowded aisle. Most 
wore pink satin skirts over petticoats. Some wore shorts with "Look . . . but 
don't touch!" written on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the guys try to get a little fresh," Stathoulis said. 
</P>
<P>
Takis Stathoulis, 33, a native of Greece who lives in Whittier, bought the 
drive-in six years ago when it was a run-down hamburger stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted something different," he said. "I said, 'Oh, man, I'm going to bring 
the '50s back.' This street was dead then." 
</P>
<P>
His wife provided the decor-black-and-white checkered floor, an old jukebox on 
which someone had just punched "Put Your Head on My Shoulder," a gas pump from 
1957 and turquoise cushioned booths, each with speakers from a drive-in movie. 
</P>
<P>
The back end of a '57 Chevy had been made into a couch. But a video game, which 
had been installed to keep youngsters busy while their parents eat, seemed 
glaringly out of place. 
</P>
<P>
The walls held covers from car magazines that had been shot at the drive-in, 
plus photos of such performers as Wolfman Jack, Chubby Checker, Gary (U.S.) 
Bonds, Frankie Avalon and Jan and Dean. Dick Clark, who once did a TV show from 
Frisco's, was up there too. 
</P>
<P>
And a mural depicted cars, carhops, burgers and leather-jacketed men with long 
sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
"I love 'Happy Days,' " said Joanne Stathoulis, referring to the TV show that 
featured the Fonz, a character who looks like the men in the mural. 
</P>
<P>
Frisco's parking lot is too small, so cars spilled over into the large lot of a 
factory next door, where the scene resembled a tailgate party at a football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"These cars bring back memories," said Don Perry, 43, a bearded, longhaired 
Bellflower resident. He and his wife had come in a blue 1966 GTO. Large dice 
hung from its rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in 'Nam from '66 to '68," Perry said over the racket of an old pink 
Corvette that had just arrived. "But I did a lot of cruisin' before that. I had 
a '65 Malibu. We'd go out to Susana Road in Dominguez Hills, mark off a 
quarter-mile and drag-race. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, there might be 150 cars on a Friday or Saturday night. We'd have 
spotters at each end looking for cops. The minute we saw the lights flash, we'd 
split." 
</P>
<P>
Perry pointed a tattooed arm at the GTO and said, "This is a muscle car, that's 
why I like it. Kids nowadays go out and pick up a Nissan or a Toyota, and it's 
all fiberglass, rubber and sheet metal. They drive a little four-cylinder 
around, paint it, put wheels on it and they think they've got something. This 
has 360 horsepower." 
</P>
<P>
He took a Pall Mall from the pack in his jeans pocket and savored what he saw 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
"My girls watch 'Happy Days' and 'American Graffiti' and wish they lived in 
that period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers atop the drive-in's roof blared "It's My Party," followed by 
"Venus." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the music," said Orv Elgie, 53, whose '49 Mercury was parked in the 
lot. Elgie of Norwalk wore a T-shirt imprinted with James Dean's face. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebel Without a Cause," he said without hesitation, when asked which of Dean's 
movies was his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Night had fallen. The old cars kept arriving. Finding no parking spots, they 
kept cruising around the restaurant. A few of the carhops took a break and 
practiced dancing on the driveway. Joanne Stathoulis has taught them the bunny 
hop, stroll, hand jive and limbo, all of which were in vogue many years before 
any of the girls were born. 
</P>
<P>
They too seemed to long for the past. "It was a lot better then than nowadays," 
said Marcy Greger, 16. "Now there's nothing fun to do." 
</P>
<P>
Her Downey High classmate, Jennifer Standley, agreed: "At hamburger stands 
then, people would get up and dance. And there were more boy-and-girl dances. 
Now, everybody goes solo." 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff Avenue, as Stathoulis had promised, had become a sea of headlights as 
cars pulled out and others pulled in. She was glad that the place is not on a 
main street. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged among some of the classic cars was a California Highway Patrol cruiser, 
manned by Dave Boyland, 32, of the Santa Fe Springs station. He seemed to enjoy 
the cruising as much as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had any problems at all, it's innocent fun," he said as the 
carhops' pink satin skirts whirled, parents strolled with their children, and 
Skip and Flip, above the revving of engines, sang "Cherry Pie."

PEOPLE: HE CAME AS A PATIENT, THEN TURNED HIS SKILLS TO MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR

When Glen Jones first came to Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey 27 
years ago, it was as a patient -- confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk 
because of arthritis of the spine. 
</P>
<P>
Jones spent more than two years in rehabilitation, and even though it was 
successful and he walked again, he did not leave the center. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 90, he is the oldest of 2,400 employees at the county facility known 
for rehabilitating people afflicted with disabilities ranging from severe 
spinal injuries to nerve and brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who lives in Huntington Park, works in the Vocational Rehabilitation 
Services workshop creating special equipment to help disabled patients lead 
better lives. 
</P>
<P>
He worked for years as a part-time employee, but for the last 10 years has been 
full-time. During that time, he is credited with creating hundreds of devices 
for the handicapped. Before coming to the center, Jones operated a sheet metal 
shop in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a genius. We tell him what we need and he invents it," vocational 
workshop supervisor Geronimo Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational therapist Arcelia Vasquez-Davis said Jones created a number of 
devices several years ago that improved the quality of life for an armless male 
patient. Jones attached a leather buckle to a pedal of a three-wheel bicycle 
that allowed the man to operate the bike, while steering with the other foot. 
Jones also made special shower attachments the man could control with his head. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his other inventions include an electrically operated stapler, elevated 
chairs with rollers, foot-operated linen hamper lids and snap-on metal devices 
for wheelchairs to hold drinking cups. 
</P>
<P>
His accomplishments have been noticed by others; recently, he was honored as 
the senior of the year by the Senior Center at Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the inventor was presented a resolution for his contributions 
by County Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Jones said he is grateful that the medical 
center was able to help him, and his work is a way of showing his appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"I love what I'm doing. I enjoy it when I can help others," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
After 30 years as a county sheriff's deputy and the last five as the public 
safety supervisor for Bellflower, Glenn D. Hutchinson is retiring. In his 
retirement letter to City Manager Jack Simpson, Hutchinson said how much he 
enjoyed his work. 
</P>
<P>
"But alas, as all dinosaurs have gone, so must I," Hutchinson said. "I am 
fortunate to still enjoy good health and have an ardent desire to do some 
traveling before my name appears in the obituary." 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson, 60, and his wife Lisa, 50, will spend a great deal of time in San 
Felipe on the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, where they are building a second 
vacation home. The Hutchinsons also will spend some time with their son, Kim, 
and his family on Harstine Island on Puget Sound in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Five graduates of local high schools have received nursing scholarships from 
the Downey Community Hospital Trust Foundation. The students will receive $500 
each semester that they are enrolled in a nursing program at a college or 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Sarmiento, a graduate of St. Joseph High School in Lakewood, will attend 
Cypress College. Shannon Coe and Steven Webber will enroll at Cerritos College. 
Both are graduates of Downey High School. Maricella Perez, a graduate of Pius X 
in Downey, will go to Mt. St. Mary's College in Los Angeles. Downey High 
graduate Elena Balarie will attend Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, members of the Whittier chapter of the Society for the Preservation 
and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America Inc. attended the 
annual Harmony College Workshop recently at Missouri Western State College in 
St. Joseph. But this year the chapter decided to send more than a quartet. A 
chorus of 56 attended. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier chapter dedicated this year's trip to Earl Moon, who was 
recognized as director emeritus after 20 years as director and a member of the 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
* Scott Calcaterra has been appointed general manager of the Long Beach Plaza 
shopping center by JMB Properties Co. of Chicago. Calcaterra has been with the 
company, which has offices in Century City, for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Vert Mooney, an orthopedic surgeon at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, 
has been appointed to the state's newly formed Industrial Medical Council by 
Gov. George Deukmejian. The 14-member council will screen candidates wishing to 
serve as medical examiners to evaluate worker's compensation cases. 
</P>
<P>
* United Parcel Service driver Roy Watamura of Cerritos was recently honored by 
his company for completing 15 years of driving without an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Patricia A. Tracey will become commander of the Long Beach Naval Station 
on Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey is the second woman in U.S. Navy history to command a major naval 
station. The first woman to head a major facility is Capt. Marsha J. Evans, who 
was recently named commander of the Treasure Island Naval Station in San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey replaces Capt. Gerald W. Dunne, who is going to Washington as executive 
director for the Defense Policy Board. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year veteran, Tracey's most recent assignment was head of enlisted plans 
and community management for the chief of naval personnel in Washington. She 
wears three Meritorious Service Medals and a Legion of Merit. She is from New 
York City and a graduate of the College of New Rochelle. 
</P>

CONSERVATION OF WATER NEW WHITTIER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members last week unanimously passed a water conservation 
ordinance that they hope will cut local water use by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The new law makes it illegal to hose down surfaces such as sidewalks and 
driveways or to allow gutters to flood repeatedly or water pipes to leak. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants may serve water only on request under the ordinance, and 
landscaping and lawns can be watered only before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Violators have 24 hours to correct a problem after receiving written notice. 
Then the city can send another notice, install water-saving devices or 
disconnect water service. Repeated offenses carry a fine of up to $300 and a 
jail term of up to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Hudson, director of the Public Services Department, said the penalties 
would apply only to the most crass, repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some teeth in here so we can deal with that type of individual," he 
told council members, but overall the conservation program will be "soft sell." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier's ordinance is based on a similar one developed by Monrovia. The law, 
which applies only to residents who buy water from the city, will automatically 
become void in April unless continuing drought conditions prompt the council to 
re-enact it.

<P>
Biola University's 1989-90 speech and debate team has been ranked 11th in the 
nation among small colleges and universities by the Intercollegiate Speech 
Tournament Results, the official ranking source for the almost 700 American 
schools that compete in forensic activities. 
</P>
<P>
Biola ranked 48th overall among all colleges and universities, finishing ahead 
of Harvard (52nd), USC (57th), and UC Berkeley (99th). The Biola team won more 
than 200 individual and team awards in the academic year just ended, including 
a fifth-place finish at the national tournament. Biola's top speaker, Cypress 
resident Don Riddick, finished the year as the 17th most successful speaker in 
the history of national forensics.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Debt Ceiling Increase 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 221 to 205 to raise the federal debt limit by $332 billion, 
from $3.122 trillion to $3.444 trillion. The new ceiling (HR 5355) is expected 
to give the government borrowing authority to pay its bills through the end of 
fiscal 1991 on Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said Congress "could cause a governmental 
disaster" by rejecting the bill. Opponent Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said 
President Bush now knows "the actual deficit of this country is $300 billion a 
year, not the $64 billion that in January he talked about" in his 1991 budget. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to hike federal borrowing by $332 billion.

Dealing With Iraq 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 208 to 191, during debate on a farm bill (HR 3950), the House 
approved the softer of two approaches for using American farm policy to 
penalize Iraq for its militarism abroad and mistreatment of citizens at home. 
</P>
<P>
This occurred six days before Iraq invaded Kuwait. After the invasion, the 
House voted 416 to 0 to endorse President Bush's economic sanctions against 
Iraq. The vote empowered the secretary of agriculture to continue U.S. credit 
guarantees that help Iraq buy American farm exports such as wheat, rice and 
cattle. Its effect was to gut tougher language, approved earlier the same day, 
that denied Commodity Credit Corp. loan guarantees to Iraq. The Senate approved 
the stricter language. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Bereuter (R-Neb.), who sponsored the softening language, said his 
amendment "provides protection to the American farmer." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) said: "We do not want . . . to subsidize 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to soften a House rebuke of Iraq.

Civil Rights Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 154, the House sent to conference with the Senate a bill 
(HR 4000) designed to overcome recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have 
made it more difficult for employees to prove claims of job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Rights Act of 1990 puts on employers the burden of proving that 
allegedly discriminatory personnel decisions were based on business necessity, 
a requirement that critics said would lead them to use the equivalent of quotas 
based on a worker's race or gender. Another disputed provision enables all bias 
victims to collect compensatory and in some cases punitive damages. Presently 
only victims of racial discrimination can receive such damages in cases of job 
bias. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by organizations such as the Leadership Conference on 
Civil Rights and AFL-CIO, and opposed by the National Assn. of Manufacturers 
and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

<P>
Real estate stocks suffered their 41st consecutive month of decline in July. 
The experts say this suggests one of three possible scenarios for the future: 
</P>
<P>
With a slowing economy, these stocks will decline further. Or, these stocks are 
on the brink of a rebound. Finally, there's the chance that they'll stay just 
where they are. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the experts. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, real estate and stock mavens alike aren't making any predictions these 
days. The market is just too questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Optimists may quickly observe, however, that some people manage to make money 
even in the midst of great uncertainty. Investors hoping to do just that are 
advised to study each potential stock very carefully. Understanding the stock 
market and understanding real estate trends are equally essential. 
</P>
<P>
First things first, though. What is a real estate stock? The answer depends on 
which expert you ask; each one has a slightly different answer. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Campbell, president of Audit Investments Inc. and editor of Realty 
Stock Review in Montvale, N.J., keeps close tabs on 198 real estate stocks. 
About 105 of these are Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). 
</P>
<P>
These trusts (discussed July 22 in the first of this series) invest in real 
property, mortgages, real estate joint ventures, other REITs, other real estate 
stocks, plus Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs) and 
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs). (These two investment vehicles were 
discussed Aug. 5 in Part 2 of this series). 
</P>
<P>
Non-REIT real estate stocks include merchant builders, which essentially 
develop properties and sell them off immediately -- such as home builders -- 
and investment builders. Examples of the latter include long-term 
owner/builders such as the Rouse Co., Forest City and Kroger Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also tracks the performance of prefabricated housing manufacturers, a 
few mortgage bankers and construction suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a miscellaneous collection of companies such as MCA Inc., 
which has vast and valuable land holdings and a development subsidiary based in 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees on just how to define a real estate stock. Most analysts do 
agree, though, on some essential guidelines for investors. 
</P>
<P>
First, it's important to closely review the underlying assets of the real 
estate company in question. What kind of properties are involved? How long have 
these properties been on the books? Are the properties generating net operating 
income? What kind of experience do the managers have? Do the managers have a 
sizeable stake in the future of the company? Where are the properties located? 
</P>
<P>
Many of these simple yet essential questions are answered in the company's 
annual report. There are also research reports available through many stock 
brokerages which present a thorough -- albeit sometimes dated -- analysis of 
individual stocks and industry sectors generally. 
</P>
<P>
"Read the annual report and read it carefully," Campbell advised. And, he 
added, review stock performance over a five-year period. "Portfolios change 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Geographically focused real estate companies will generally outperform 
competitors with properties spread throughout the country, Campbell noted. 
</P>
<P>
Managers who put their energies into one region and/or one particular type of 
property -- such as retail centers -- are far more likely to succeed at 
creating value for stockholders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weingarten Realty, for example, has managed to do well even in otherwise 
troubled Texas by staying focused, Campbell said. "They've been able to grow in 
an otherwise lousy market." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Federal Realty has done well by buying retail centers in older 
neighborhoods, while New Plan Realty has carved out a niche for itself in 
buying retail centers in small towns. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of specialization, say real estate experts, is the key to a healthy 
bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, investors should learn how various economic indicators relate to real 
estate performance. 
</P>
<P>
Office building stocks are closely correlated with gross national product 
(GNP). Retail center stocks follow disposable personal income (DPI). And, 
property prices in the Southwest are closely linked to oil prices. Recent 
increases in oil, say real estate observers, may bode well for properties in 
Arkansas, Texas and other Oil Patch states, while depressing real estate in 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newer trends emerging in real estate stocks is what's known as a 
partnership roll-up. Many so-called private-label limited partnerships and 
publicly traded master limited partnerships (MLPs) are rolling into more 
liquid, publicly traded REITs. 
</P>
<P>
By rolling up, these partnerships hope to leave behind the stigma associated 
with syndicated partnership deals and instead operate more as mainstream 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical syndication of the 1980s was a bad deal," however, said John 
Moran, a portfolio manager for PRA Security Advisors of San Francisco, an 
institutional money management company specializing in real estate securities. 
"Rolling up a limited partnership into a REIT won't make a good deal out of a 
bad deal." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the partnerships ran into trouble because they were too highly 
leveraged. As soon as the economy softened, the managers found operating income 
insufficient to cover debt service. For this reason, Moran advised real estate 
stock investors to seek out companies with very little leverage. The more 
equity a company has, he said, the better. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Ross, partner at accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Century 
City agrees. But, he added, roll-ups may provide a good buy if the underlying 
properties are well-maintained and generating a healthy cash flow. REIT 
investors generally should limit themselves to yield investments, advised Ross. 
Equity-oriented REITs which fail to provide positive investment yields, he 
said, are best left alone. 
</P>
<P>
Also questionable are finite-life real estate investment trusts, also known as 
FREITs. "Their history has been checkered, to say the least," observed Barry 
Vinocur, editor of Stanger's Investment Advisor of Shrewsbury, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The six open-ended and one closed-ended real estate mutual funds that currently 
exist also continue to post questionable results. In the last year, the best 
performance recorded was 9.53%, the worst was -18%. The mean performance was 
about -5% to -7%. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors have done and will continue to do very well in real estate 
stocks, observed Vinocur. For most individuals and portfolio managers, however, 
"this has been a tough time for real estate stocks."

TNT'S 'HEAT WAVE' STARS 'L.A. LAW' ACTOR IN THE RETELLING OF 1965 RIOTS

<P>
Blair Underwood doesn't remember the long hot summer of 1965 when racial 
tension in Los An geles culminated in the brutal Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
"How old do you think I was?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps 2, the listener guesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 1," Underwood says with a sly smile. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years after those uprisings, Underwood is starring with James Earl 
Jones, Cicely Tyson and Sally Kirkland in "Heat Wave," a drama about the riots 
that premieres Monday at 5 p.m. on the TNT cable network. TNT shows "Heat Wave" 
again Monday at 7 p.m., 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., and several other times throughout 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
Shot on location in Watts and Beverly Hills, "Heat Wave" focuses on Robert 
Richardson (played by Underwood), a young black ad messenger for the Los 
Angeles Times who was assigned to report on the Watts riots because white 
reporters couldn't safely cover the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Heat Wave" marks the second time this year that Underwood -- who is about to 
begin his fourth season on NBC's "L.A. Law" as the slick, self-confident 
attorney Jonathan Rollins -- has starred in a TV movie about a watershed 
incident in recent black-American history. 
</P>
<P>
In January, he appeared in the NBC drama "Murder in Mississippi," playing James 
Chaney, who was murdered with two other civil rights activists in 1964. "I 
would rather do something that has a message to it," he says. " 'Heat Wave' has 
political and historical overtones. Both (movies) are important pieces of 
history." 
</P>
<P>
It was an uphill struggle for Underwood to get cast in "Mississippi" because of 
his sophisticated "L.A. Law" image. Just the opposite happened with "Heat 
Wave." "They (the producers) just came to me -- which is a new thing," he says. 
"It never happened before. Probably my work in 'Murder in Mississippi' had 
something to do with them coming to me." 
</P>
<P>
Underwood admits he knew very little about the Watts riots before "Heat Wave." 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do a lot of reading and talking to people who were around at that 
time in Watts," he says. "Everybody has a different opinion on what happened. 
Some were happy we were making the movie. But the question I kept hearing was, 
'Why tell the story now? It's something we shouldn't celebrate, it's something 
we should forget.' " 
</P>
<P>
The actor tends to agree that "Heat Wave" can refocus attention on the plight 
of those who lived 25 years ago. Yet, he says, "It's still relevant today. But 
I have no idea how this movie will be received." 
</P>
<P>
Conditions in Watts, Underwood believes, have gotten even worse since that 
heated summer. "The same grievances and questions haven't been answered," he 
says. "The reason I say it's much worse today is because we live in a much more 
violent society. In the five weeks of filming this movie in and around 
South-Central and East Los Angeles, we had 12 drive-by shootings within two 
blocks of the set. It's still very much a war zone and the gangs run the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
As for "L.A. Law," this past season was a pivotal one for Jonathan Rollins. He 
spent more time in court trying cases, fell in love with a beautiful divorcee 
and nearly quit the firm when he learned a client had dealings in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great for my character," Underwood says. "It's always good if a 
character can grow and develop. It's not good for a character to just stagnate 
and sit there." 
</P>
<P>
It was producer Steven Bochco's initial plan to establish Rollins' character 
during the first two seasons. "Once that was established we would see another 
side of him," Underwood says. "He is black and certain things will happen to 
him because of his race. Let's see how he reacts." 
</P>
<P>
Underwood is excited about the upcoming season. "It's going to be good stuff," 
he says, rubbing his hands together. "They have five or six writers this year 
who are all brand new. That will be good. I wouldn't want to wish that job on 
my worst enemy. First of all they have to maintain the level of quality of the 
first season and juggle 13 or 14 cast members and make it all work." 
</P>
<P>
In his free moments, Underwood and his writer brother, Frank, manage their own 
production company. "We have a couple of projects we are working on right now," 
he says. "There are so many stories that haven't been told that can be about 
black history. If I can have a say-so or if I can initiate those projects . . . 
That's where my head is now."

COVER STORY: THE FIRE BEHIND 'HEAT WAVE'

What was amazing to Michael Lazarou is that the Watts "insurrection" 25 years 
ago didn't happen long before. He said the rage had long been in place. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarou, the 29-year-old screenwriter of "Heat Wave," premiering Monday at 5 
p.m. on TNT cable, has had a passionate amateur's fascination with history -- 
but especially the flaming anarchy that engulfed South-Central Los Angeles in 
1965. He has been obsessed with it since he was 4 and living barely two miles 
from the riots. 
</P>
<P>
To research the movie, Lazarou talked with people who were in the riot areas -- 
rioters, bystanders, police officers, members of the National Guard. Lazarou 
recalled an interview with an officer and a rioter "sitting side by side, 
reminiscing on how it changed their lives." 
</P>
<P>
He was driven to keep his script within the tightest confines of truth. His 
interest in dramatizing the story was sparked when he learned about the 
existence of the young classified ad messenger, Robert Richardson (played in 
the movie by "L.A. Law's" Blair Underwood); it was through Richardson's 
experience that the story of Watts could be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The story around Richardson was mostly invented -- although the characters and 
their lives were based on real people, events and emotions (some names have 
been changed because the people couldn't be located and clearance obtained). 
But Lazarou said he was obliged to get a true reenactment of the riot itself. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to put it into perspective: 
</P>
<P>
"After World War II, L.A. was painted as the new paradise," Lazarou said. "It 
was the boom town. Newspapers from here to Birmingham (Ala.) were filled with 
(Los Angeles) job ads. This and the fact that L.A. was viewed as a color-blind 
dream -- the most racially progressive city in America -- brought 
African-Americans here by the hundreds of thousands." 
</P>
<P>
But the promise was hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarou said what evolved was a prison without walls: Public buses didn't run 
through Watts. There were few jobs available in the community and jobs outside 
were hard to get to. People with skills who were eminently employable were 
shunned from the work force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One scene in the script suggests the dreadful isolation: Richardson and his 
friend happen across Alameda Street into Lynwood, acclaimed as an All-American 
city in 1961, and they're chased by white toughs called the Spook Hunters, 
which was a real gang. 
</P>
<P>
"If you crossed Alameda, if you were caught in Lynwood and were black, you 
literally took your life in your hands," Lazarou said. "We're talking about de 
facto segregation -- even more cruel than that they left behind." 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood -- then referred to as "Lily White Lynwood" -- was nearly all-white and 
proclaimed by the Chamber of Commerce as "The Best Place to Live Best." Today 
it's about 20% white. 
</P>
<P>
To Lazarou, these root-cause realities help explain the ferocity of the mobs 
when they finally unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, on the night of Aug. 11, whatever patience there was left, ran out," 
Lazarou said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a number of circumstances at play that led to so many people being 
at Avalon and 116th Street. It was uncharacteristically muggy and hot. 
Everybody was outside on their stoops." 
</P>
<P>
The rioting itself seems to be meticulously re-created in the script, 
especially the confrontation at that intersection between a young black driver 
and a Highway Patrol motorcycle officer who stopped him for a sobriety test. 
Lazarou recounted it, based on his interviews: 
</P>
<P>
"Marquette Frye was with his stepbrother Ronald and was pulled over. He was on 
parole and riding a lucky streak. Things were going well; his life was turning 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"He was bound and determined to talk his way out of this jam and he was 
downright ebullient, friendly, cooperative. The patrolman responded in kind. He 
was very, very, very cooperative. The rapport couldn't have been better. Frye, 
a little bit drunk, was putting on a show and the crowd, continuing to grow, 
was eating it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Even Officer (Lee) Minikis commented to him, 'You're quite a comedian.' 
</P>
<P>
"They were hitting it off. Of course, the Highway Patrol in those days didn't 
have the rep for brutality that the LAPD and the county sheriffs had. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Frye's mother showed up and was absolutely furious at her son for driving 
while drinking and proceeded to yell at him. The crowd by this time had grown 
to several hundred and Frye started to get upset, realizing that he might be 
going to jail. He was fighting back tears, then lost his temper and pushed his 
mother out of the way, pointed to the officer and said, 'I'm not going anywhere 
with that white -- -- -- -- -- -- -- !' 
</P>
<P>
"And just like that, the mood of this crowd went from jovial to very tense and 
very chaotic. He was subdued by force and his mother and stepbrother came to 
his aid -- and they too were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd started getting nasty and the partner of the officer called an 1199, 
which is CHP car code for 'officer needs help!' Then came Code 3, the sirens. 
</P>
<P>
"They were soon joined by LAPD -- a convoy practically -- all coming from the 
north while CHP and sheriffs were coming from the south, while the sirens in 
turn were attracting more people like a magnet. The more police, the more 
hostile the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"A young lady barber, Joyce Ann Gaines, was pulled from the crowd and arrested. 
Her smock gave her the appearance of being pregnant -- which she wasn't. 
Someone screamed, 'Those whitey cops are beating on a pregnant woman!' 
</P>
<P>
"That's what really sent the crowd ultimately into abject rage. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the spark. Within 36 hours the riots encompassed 54 square miles of 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The official toll was 35 killed, with 1,200 reported injuries and 4,000 people 
arrested and 600 buildings burned and looted in six days of rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lazarou, "It's so important that the viewer understands the context, 
understands why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to point out that this (the Frye-Gaines arrest) was just the 
spark, nothing more. I mean it could have been anything. What was amazing is 
that it happened then and not much earlier." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a happy story then, and Lazarou said that it's not a happy story in 
South-Central Los Angeles now: "There, when the smoke cleared, little was ever 
done to improve the situation. Recommendations for improved education, housing, 
jobs, fell by the wayside. Let's face it, you can't look at what's going on 
down there and put a happy face on it."

THIS RAM ASSISTANT IS SERIOUS ABOUT FOOTBALL; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: FORMER UCLA FULLBACK JAIRO PENARANDA TAKES WHAT HE HAS SEEN AND LEARNED AS 
A PLAYER AND SIDELINE SPECTATOR AND PUTS IT TO USE AS A COACH. 
</P>

<P>
Don't talk to Jairo Penaranda if you're looking for laughs. He's not funny at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"Jairo is a very serious guy," said Bob Dunivant, Penaranda's coach at 
Burroughs High in Burbank from 1972-75. "He was very hard-working. There wasn't 
too much humor with Jairo (pronounced HI-row)." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda is, however, a sound choice if you're interested in football. 
</P>
<P>
The former standout running back for Burroughs played at UCLA and then in the 
NFL. He is now a coach with the Rams. Although he never made people laugh, the 
6-foot, 210-pound Penaranda did make opponents hold their sides in pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Jairo was one of the best all-around backs in Burroughs history," Dunivant 
said. "He reminded me of Roger Craig, the way he ran. He'd get those knees 
pumping way up high and it was very difficult to tackle him. Very difficult. I 
remember Jairo dragging people down the football field a lot. And he never made 
an attempt to evade people on the field. He went after them." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda, whose brothers Edgar and Al also played football for Burroughs, 
scored five touchdowns in one game at Burroughs during his senior year when he 
was named to the All-CIF and all-state teams. He also played football for 
Burroughs, lettered in track and was the captain of both school teams in his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
He played two seasons at San Fernando Valley State College (now Cal State 
Northridge) and then earned a position on the UCLA roster in 1978 as a walk-on, 
but he did not play in a game that season. In 1979, Coach Terry Donahue used 
Penaranda as a fullback and on special teams, taking advantage of his powerful 
build and mammoth legs and his ability and desire to block big men. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, however, he carried the ball 55 times for 254 yards and scored two 
touchdowns while continuing to serve as the blocking back and as a wrecking 
ball on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the 1979 season that Penaranda said he began looking at the game 
from a coach's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the second string, you get a lot of time to watch," said 
Penaranda, 32. "I did that, and I started to look at things differently than I 
did as a player. You start to see the whole game instead of just what your 
assignment is. After a while, I wanted to learn more about the game, to learn 
things from a coach's viewpoint. So I watched and I listened and I started 
thinking that coaching might be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda was drafted by the Rams in 1980 but played sparingly in the NFL for 
just two seasons. After a season with the Oakland Invaders of the U.S. Football 
League, he knew his days of crashing into people were over. But he also knew 
that he wanted to stay in the game. And what he had seen and learned as a 
player and a sideline spectator during the previous several years he now wanted 
to put to use. 
</P>
<P>
His coaching career began in the same place his playing career had started, at 
Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped me for a couple of years," Dunivant said. "He had never mentioned 
coaching to me before that, but after he started I knew he was destined for 
success as a coach. He had such a great way of getting along with the kids, and 
he was such a responsible guy." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda took the next step in 1987, signing on as a volunteer coach working 
with the special teams at USC, not an easy move for a guy who had been 
conditioned for three years to stomp on anything wearing cardinal and gold. 
After two seasons with the Trojans, he got a call from the Rams and began his 
pro coaching career last year, working as an assistant on the special teams. 
</P>
<P>
It is a part of the game that Penaranda said he enjoys very much, now that he 
doesn't have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"My junior year at UCLA we were playing USC and I got my first chance on the 
kickoff-return team," he said. "We didn't have a very good team that year, and 
I was real nervous about it. I can still remember it so clearly. They kicked 
and all of a sudden all I can see are these huge guys running downfield, and it 
seemed like all of them were running at me. There were several of us together, 
forming the wedge, and they just destroyed us. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got up, I remember thinking, 'This is not for me.' But I stuck with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as he gives advice to the Rams' special teams players, he knows how they 
feel about such assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people have an image of what special teams guys are like," Penaranda 
said. "They think all of them must be crazy. But they're not. Special teams are 
a personal challenge. You have to say to yourself, 'My man will not make a 
block,' or 'My man will not make the tackle,' and you have to take it 
personally. But at the same time, you have to work as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Special teams play is chaos in harmony and a controlled madness. Despite what 
it looks like, there are a lot of rules to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda was born in the Atlantic port of Barranquilla, Colombia. His family 
moved to the United States when he was an infant, settling first in Miami and a 
few years later in Burbank. Penaranda has returned to Barranquilla several 
times. On occasion he and relatives have watched satellite transmissions of NFL 
games together. His relatives, he said, pretend they understand, but he knows 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"They watch with me because they know that's what I do," he said. "They 
understand very little of it, though." 
</P>
<P>
Penaranda, it seems, has enough football knowledge for the entire family. And 
he hopes to know much more about it before he leaves the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can coach permanently," he said. "I hope this is my start, that this 
becomes my career. And I want to stay with the pro game. I watch some college 
games, but I don't want to go back. This is where I want to make my life." 
</P>
<P>
He should, according to one who has watched his transformation from a youngster 
to a 32-year-old man, have few problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Jairo that I always noticed," Dunivant said, "was that 
football was always No. 1 in his life, even as a kid. The other kids had other 
things to do and football was just one of them, but with Jairo it was 
different. He was the first one on the practice field and the last one to 
leave. When he coached with me, he was the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"And even though he had been gone from here for a long time, when he coached 
here the kids on the team listened to Jairo. The name Penaranda means a lot at 
Burroughs."

SAMPRAS CLIMBING TENNIS LADDER; 
</P>
<P>
RATINGS: AFTER WINNING THREE TOURNAMENTS, FORMER PALOS VERDES HIGH PLAYER IS 
RANKED 14TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Almost 19 now, Pete Sampras finds himself each morning facing one of the curses 
of maturity: the drudgery of shaving. 
</P>
<P>
But even on those days when one of America's future hopes to win Wimbledon 
decides to skip the razor, a rosy glow still peeks through the stubble. 
</P>
<P>
Here, clearly, is a man on the brink who is in the pink. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sampras showed how rosy his future is -- and how slim the margin is 
between a hot young talent and a champion. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in a match against Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg, the semifinals 
of the Volvo Los Angeles Tennis Championships at UCLA Tennis Center. Edberg won 
it, 6-2, 6-7, 6-1, but Sampras left everyone, including Edberg -- the world's 
No. 2 player -- impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very dangerous player," Edberg said. "With time and matches, I think 
he's going to be a top 10 player very soon. He's got all the ingredients to be 
a very good player if he keeps working." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras showed off all the weapons in his arsenal in Saturday's semifinal, a 
duel that matched up two of tennis' premier serve-and-volley specialists: 
Sampras often aced a flatfooted Edberg, blasting his first serve consistently 
in the 115-m.p.h. range. 
</P>
<P>
He also hung tough against Edberg's high-kicking rocket serve, ripping a series 
of blistering backhand winners past the onrushing Swede. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras hit more winners that afternoon than did Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the match was experience. For every brilliant shot Sampras 
hit, Edberg had an even better reply. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have all the shots I need," Sampras said. "It's just a matter of 
putting them all together at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
The way Sampras is playing, that time doesn't seem very far away. He has had an 
outstanding year -- winning three tournaments -- and his world computer ranking 
has climbed to No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Sampras was playing in the ATP Championship in Mason, Ohio -- one of 
a series of hard-court tournaments leading up to the U.S. Open. He has now 
reached the semifinals of two consecutive tournaments, including the Players' 
International in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore at Palos Verdes High, Sampras was unbeaten in 56 sets and 
captured the Southern Section CIF 4-A title. The following season he turned 
professional, almost as an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
In April of 1988, Sampras skipped four days of school and proceeded to knock 
off two top touring professionals -- Ramesh Krishnan and Eliot Teltscher -- in 
the Champions Cup at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
He quit the Palos Verdes High team, kept the check for $7,000, and said goodby 
to amateur days. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras credits his fast start this year to a preseason conditioning regimen. 
He took on a new coach -- Joe Brandi of the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy -- 
who put him through a weightlifting and running program, in addition to five 
hours of tennis each day. 
</P>
<P>
It paid immediate dividends. Sampras reached the quarterfinals in Sydney, 
losing to Mats Wilander, and the semifinals in Milan, where he lost to Ivan 
Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Then Sampras started going all the way. He broke into the Top 20 at the U.S. 
Pro Indoor Championships in Philadelphia in February, knocking off Tim Mayotte 
and Andre Agassi on his way to a final against eventual French Open champion 
Andres Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, Sampras defeated Gomez in straight sets, 7-6, 7-5, 6-2, winning the 
same tournament where it all began two years before, when Sampras had battled 
through the qualifying draw as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditioning is the biggest factor," Sampras said. "It's carried me 
through the whole year to this point." 
</P>
<P>
The week before Wimbledon, Sampras won a grass-court tournament at Manchester, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis experts believe that if Sampras can harness the thunder of his attacking 
game at Wimbledon, he can become this country's best chance to win tennis' 
biggest prize. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon was Sampras' biggest letdown of the year, however. He got an unlucky 
draw -- grass-court expert Christo van Rensburg of South Africa -- and was 
eliminated in the first round in three tough sets. 
</P>
<P>
"I prepared well for Wimbledon," Sampras said. "I just didn't play well." 
</P>
<P>
He bounced back a week later, however, winning a tournament in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's realistic for me to win Wimbledon yet," Sampras said. "I 
think I'll play my best tennis in my mid-20s, so I have a lot more chances at 
it. I don't want to put extra pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
That laid-back approach has been the hallmark of Sampras' career -- going back 
to age 14, when he switched from a two-handed backhand to improve his 
serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Sampras was going against the grain of most junior players, who 
were developing as base-line counterpunchers. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras took it a step further by seeking out competition against older, 
stronger players. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing on winning matches, he honed his aggressive game against 
the hard hitters, and along the way he learned the fine art of improvisation so 
vital to attacking players. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a high ranking in juniors," Sampras said. "I was playing to 
improve my game, and it's really paying off right now. It was a move I made for 
the long run." 
</P>
<P>
The one-handed backhand -- taught to Sampras by his first coach, pediatrician 
Peter Fischer -- is also reaping rewards. 
</P>
<P>
It improves Sampras' range and gives him an array of spins -- slice, flat or 
topspin -- for all situations. It also helps Sampras charge the net quicker on 
his approach shot. 
</P>
<P>
A six-foot, 180-pounder, Sampras seemingly has only one weakness -- inside his 
own head. He admits his concentration lags at times. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm up a service break in the second set, sometimes I'm already looking 
ahead to shaking the guy's hand after the match," Sampras said. "I've got to 
constantly remind myself to concentrate on every point." 
</P>
<P>
When Sampras wins the mental battle with himself, his opponents often fall as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's U.S. Open, Sampras beat defending champion Wilander -- a crafty 
base-liner -- in a draining, five-set, second-round match played in sweltering 
humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras' concentration never flagged in that one. At other times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals at Toronto this year, Sampras faced longtime nemesis Michael 
Chang, whom he has been battling since both were 10. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras won a tiebreaker in the second set to pull even, but eased up on Chang 
in the third and lost the match, 3-6, 7-6, 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have won that one, but I let it slip away," Sampras said. "That's one 
reason I haven't had too much success against Chang at the pro level. He's not 
going to give you a match . . . you have to earn it. But I'm sure we're going 
to be going at it many more times before it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras also lost this week to Chang, 7-5, 6-4, in the ATP Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg didn't seem to think Sampras' concentration lapses were a serious 
obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens to everybody," Edberg said. "It's just a matter of learning, being 
out there and playing matches." 
</P>
<P>
While Sampras continues his lessons, he represents part of the changing of the 
guard -- the youth movement that includes Chang, Agassi and others -- in 
American men's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
To set up that Toronto meeting with Chang, Sampras defeated veteran John 
McEnroe, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a thrill," Sampras said. "At first I was a little nervous. For the 
last 10 years, I've looked up to him. At first, I was playing John McEnroe -- 
the legend. Then I started playing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Sampras' computer ranking is only a rung below McEnroe's 13th. 
</P>
<P>
For Sampras, that's only a step away from putting legends behind him, and 
starting some of his own.LORI SHEPLER / Los Angeles Times

GOLF: HE WAS THE FIRST BLACK TO WIN A PGA TOURNAMENT, BUT IT HARDLY BEGAN A

As a young caddie at the all-white Carolinas Country club in Charlotte, N.C., 
Charlie Sifford was allowed to play golf once a week -- a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't no black golf courses in North Carolina, so they let us play on 
Mondays," Sifford said Friday from Albuquerque where he is competing in the 
Charley Pride Senior Golf tournament. "I was shooting par golf when I was 15 or 
16 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Sifford, 68, was not the first black to play golf in the early 1950s, and 
certainly not the only black to try to play on tour. Bill Spiller and Tom 
Rhodes played before him and with him. But Sifford was the first black to win a 
PGA event, the 1967 Hartford Open, and his perseverance the last 40 years has 
set him apart as golf's Jackie Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never frightened, but I knew it wouldn't be a picnic," Sifford said. "I 
was determined, so it was no surprise to me. The job had to be done, and I 
thought I was qualified to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sifford wanted equal play on the national PGA tour, not just on the Negro golf 
circuit, on which he won the Negro National Open six times. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, a year before Arnold Palmer joined the tour, Sifford played in his 
first PGA event and finished that year with $281.43 in official tour winnings. 
He remembers playing with Palmer the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Canadian Open, and I led it the first day, but I think Palmer won 
the tournament," Sifford said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Palmer, however, Sifford wasn't considered official by the PGA. In golf 
then, blacks weren't recognized as PGA members. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1962 before the PGA was forced to throw out its "Caucasians only" rule 
and open tournaments to blacks. But such a rule never stopped Sifford. 
</P>
<P>
In his early days, he played in PGA tournaments in the North and in the West, 
where some tournament directors were more liberal. As a rule, he did not play 
in spring and early summer in the South. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Sifford became the first black to play in a PGA tournament in the 
South. He tied for fourth in the Greater Greensboro (N.C.) Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually I became official (in the PGA) in 1960, but not as a member," Sifford 
said. "They gave me an approved player's card in 1960, and I kept it until 1974 
before I missed qualifying. I was in the top 60 in money for 10 years 
(1960-69)." 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Sifford's determination was a source of controversy. Even 
as a proven player, in 1961, the PGA argued within its ranks about Sifford's 
eligibility. And later that year blacks picketed the Houston Memorial Park 
course because Sifford had not been invited to compete in the Houston 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Sifford, though, just kept getting better. He followed his victory in the 
Hartford Open by one in the 1969 Los Angeles Open. His best year on the tour 
was 1967, when he won $47,025 and finished 25th on the earnings list. 
</P>
<P>
Sifford quit the tour in the late '70s and took a job as a teaching 
professional at Sleepy Hollow Golf Course in Ohio. But it wasn't long before he 
was back full time, joining the senior tour in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
On the regular tour, Sifford had total earnings of $341,345. In nine years on 
the senior tour, he has won $646,956. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Sifford told the Milwaukee Journal that he and golf had worked out an 
equitable arrangement: He earned his living from golf and in return helped golf 
find a place for his race. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my playing and my character, I think I have done a good job," 
Sifford said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, he isn't done yet.

<P>
RECREATION: SKIPPER CARRILLO, CALLED A COMMUNITY TREASURE, WORKS HARD SO OTHERS 
CAN PLAY BALL.

<P>
Mothers don't love their children more than Laguna Beach residents love Skipper 
Carrillo, says Norm Borucki, Carrillo's friend for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
He is only half-joking. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo, 52, is as integral to Laguna as the baseball field that bears his 
name. For three decades, he has been third-base umpire, batboy, scorekeeper and 
cheering squad for high school and Little League games. He has tidied locker 
rooms, washed uniforms and prepped the fields. And stored it all in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
That's especially remarkable for someone who suffered brain damage at birth. 
</P>
<P>
Through his indefatigable contributions on sports fields, friends say, Carrillo 
has become the city's most recognized resident. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe he could be elected mayor if he wanted to be," says Borucki, 
an official with the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. and former Laguna Beach 
High School varsity baseball coach. "You walk down the street with him, and 
everybody knows Skipper. He's high-fiving people and people are tooting the 
horn." 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna, people often have a Skipper Carrillo story. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time six years ago during the all-star playoffs against Mission Viejo 
North, a contest that Laguna had been expected to lose by a lopsided margin. 
Carrillo moved to the dugout and went to work. 
</P>
<P>
"He had them all fired up," former head coach Tom Klingenmeier says. The Laguna 
players, not known for their playoff prowess, moved ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"This came as a surprise to Laguna Beach people," he says. "I mean, whoa, we're 
up. What do you do now? We were not supposed to beat this team at all." 
</P>
<P>
It also jolted Mission Viejo fans, who asked that Carrillo be ejected from the 
dugout, where, according to the rules, there could be just 14 uniforms. It was 
the "first time in his life he ever had to leave the dugout," Klingenmeier 
says. 
</P>
<P>
If it was a tough call for Laguna, it did not do Mission Viejo fans much good 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"The players were so upset somebody would do that to Skipper, they said, 'Let's 
win this for Skipper,' " Klingenmeier says. "So we murdered the Mission Viejo 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo, who often insists that a "home run day" springs from behind each 
sunset, has reversed the fate of many ballgames, friends say. Over the years, 
he has also regularly stunned residents with his recall of baseball history. 
Klingenmeier's son J.T. says, "He just seems to know everything." 
</P>
<P>
Like Carrillo's recollection of the first minor league baseball game he 
attended with his father in 1951. It was at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. The 
Hollywood Stars jumped out in front of the L.A. Angels, 5-0, and held the lead 
until the ninth inning, when the Angels tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
"With two outs, (the batter) knocked a home run over the left-field wall to 
beat the Angels, 6-5," Carrillo says. "And that was only the first game of the 
twin bill." 
</P>
<P>
The second game started at 8 p.m., he said. The Angels lost that one, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
No point in looking up the scores to see whether Carrillo knows his stuff, says 
Klingenmeier, now the high school's junior varsity coach. Klingenmeier already 
has. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in the Major League Baseball Encyclopedia," he says. "He's accurate. 
Very accurate." 
</P>
<P>
For local athletes, having Carrillo around town for the last four decades has 
been like having their sports memories stored in a computer. 
</P>
<P>
While baseball is his first love, Carrillo also supports football and 
basketball players. Ron Lutz, a former basketball player who is now the city's 
recreation supervisor, says Carrillo can remember details of Lutz's games. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say, 'Hey, Skip, how far had we fallen behind in the second quarter in 
the 1962 game in Oxnard against Santa Clara High School?' and he can probably 
tell me," Lutz says. 
</P>
<P>
But Carrillo's value to Laguna Beach is that "he's doing things that need to be 
done to make a sports program go," he says. 
</P>
<P>
During football season, he marks the downs. During baseball season, Carrillo's 
sprints to right field to flip the numbers on the old manual scoreboard, then 
back to the dugout, are part of the event, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Carrillo packs the large numbers in a sturdy suitcase, snaps it 
shut and carries it home. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone to take my job," he says. Residents say no one ever will. 
</P>
<P>
When Coca-Cola wanted to install an automated scoreboard, "the whole town got 
mad," says Diane Crain, a friend of Carrillo's. "Everybody protested against 
it, because that's Skipper's job." 
</P>
<P>
After being told of Carrillo's contribution by local residents and baseball 
officials, Little League national headquarters decided to give "special 
recognition" to Carrillo during its world series this year. On Aug. 20, 
Carrillo will fly to Williamsport, Pa., where he will be honored before 
thousands of spectators before a championship game for "unparalleled dedication 
and exemplary leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The last time a volunteer was so honored was several years ago, Little League 
spokesman Steve Keener says. 
</P>
<P>
After he was given an award for volunteer service several years ago, the Orange 
County Department of Education produced a film about Carrillo that aired on 
KOCE public TV. The film focused on his life and volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo's life has been a come-from-behind victory of sorts. Born two months 
early and with a shortage of oxygen, Carrillo says that his physical 
difficulties have included problems with his hearing, sight and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
Until he was 15, he attended boarding schools for "special people that need 
special training," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The devotion of his parents buoyed his confidence, he says. Determined that his 
son would not be intimidated by "adult talk," Carrillo's father, a semipro 
baseball coach, taught Carrillo to build a vocabulary of baseball terms. 
</P>
<P>
His home still is "Wrigley Field," his bedroom "the dugout." Friends are 
quickly renamed after famous ballplayers. They consider it an honor. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo's father died in 1966 -- the same year, Carrillo quickly adds, that 
the Dodgers lost the World Series to Baltimore and that Willie Davis made three 
errors in one game. 
</P>
<P>
When Carrillo's mother died six years ago, she left her Laguna Beach house, 
which overlooks the high school's football and baseball fields, and a trust 
fund to her son. Carrillo and a cousin now share the hillside home. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not on the field, Carrillo cleans and shops for his 80-year-old 
neighbor as a favor. He attends Mass almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's impossible to believe you have somebody who is just totally good," 
says Gene Crain, former president of the Laguna Beach Little League, "but 
Skipper is, because he doesn't know how to be any other way." 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo has goals. He wants to own a home uniform and road jersey for every 
team in the Major Leagues, and he wants to be batboy for the Dodgers for one 
complete game. His friends are rooting for him. Carrillo deserves to win, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"He has no secrets, he has no bad habits," Crain says. "What you see is what it 
is, and what it is is just good." 
</P>
<P>
"I just do the best I can," Carrillo says. "Let's put it that way." 
</P>

FOND MEMORIES OF HIS OWN JAZZ CLUB KEEP PLUCKING BASSIST PAT SENATORE'S 
HEARTSTRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bassist Pat Senatore has played with some pretty big names in jazz and pop -- 
Stan Kenton, Herb Alpert &amp; The Tijuana Brass, Les Brown and the VIP Trio 
with pianist Cedar Walton and drummer Billy Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt in Senatore's mind that his shining hour was as the 
proprietor/house bandleader/chief bottle washer of Pasquale's, which from 1978 
until it closed in October, 1983, was one of the Los Angeles area's best-known 
jazz rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a day that goes by that someone doesn't come up to me and say how 
much they miss the club and all that," said Senatore, 54, of the club that was 
perched on Carbon Beach in Malibu, just south of the Malibu Pier. It has since 
been reopened as the Pier View Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he most misses about the club, the answer was easy: "The music." 
"Man, I don't think I really understood how great it was there," he said. "I 
was hassled by so many problems. I wish I had that scene now, because I'm more 
into playing and learning, though I learned by playing with those great cats 
every night." 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale's -- Pasquale is Senatore's given name -- was a special place. The 
oblong room that seated about 150 people had glass walls -- with doors that 
opened -- on the western and southern faces and a deck that overlooked the 
beach a few feet below, giving customers an oceanfront view. When the doors 
were opened, the ocean breeze would waft in, providing an exhilarating mix of 
heated jazz and cool winds. 
</P>
<P>
Opened by Senatore and his wife, Barbara, in early 1978, Pasquale's quickly 
became a favorite with the public and the musical community. Senatore -- a 
native of Newark, N.J., who attended the Juilliard School for two years -- felt 
this happened not only because of the room's spectacular atmosphere, but 
because he insisted that the music be given top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"Pasquale's was a bona fide jazz club," he said. "The whole reason for the 
place was the music. Too many clubs feature other things. You have to spotlight 
the music first, and everything else is an embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one night after we'd first opened and there were only two people in 
the room and they got up and started dancing. I yelled over the microphone, 
'There's no dancing in this club,' and our only two customers left," he said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Soon customers were there by the hundreds. Often, they could be seen lining up 
outside the club's front door, eager to hear such jazz notables as pianists 
Chick Corea, George Cables, Roger Kellaway and Alan Broadbent, saxophonists Joe 
Henderson, Joe Farrell and John Klemmer, singer Willie Bobo and trumpeter 
Freddie Hubbard. And on sunny days, crowds would gather on the beach below the 
club, listening to the sounds that wafted out. 
</P>
<P>
As successful as Pasquale's was for the Senatores -- who ran the club 
mom-and-pop style -- the room was also a source of seemingly continual 
problems, often caused by the weather when people couldn't get to the club. 
Heavy rain closed Pacific Coast Highway on many occasions, putting an 
additional financial strain on Senatore, who was operating on a five-year lease 
from Ishmael Barrera, who owned the land and building that housed Pasquale's. 
</P>
<P>
When Senatore's lease expiration approached, he attempted to negotiate a new 
one, but Barrera wanted to carry him on a month-to-month basis. "He wouldn't 
budge or negotiate," Senatore said. "And the room needed some work, but there 
was no way I could do that without some guarantee that I could stay, so I 
closed on October 23, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a magic spot but the obstacles after a while turned it into a 
nightmare. I was fighting with everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Senatore continues to look for a club site, and feels that the only way to 
control an operation is to buy the building. "Then you don't have to worry, 
you're in charge." He says he has a couple of irons in the fire, but nothing he 
wants to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
Music is what's occupied Senatore in the years since Pasquale's. Going back to 
being a free-lance bassist wasn't easy at first for the soft-voiced, 
quick-to-smile Senatore, but it's gotten better. "People didn't know I was 
available," he said, "but now the gigs are coming in pretty steadily. And I can 
say that since January, most of my income has come from jazz gigs." 
</P>
<P>
For more than four years, Senatore, who can be heard with the VIP Trio on 
"Standard Album, Vol. I &amp; II" (California Breeze), has been part of the Pat 
Britt-Wilbur Brown quintet, an energy-filled be-bop-based jazz unit that plays 
Sunday evenings at the Cat and Fiddle Pub and Restaurant in Hollywood. "It's 
become such a part of my life that if I didn't do it, I'd feel like something 
was missing. It's always a ball," he said of playing with the band led by the 
two vital saxophonists that also features pianist Dwight Dickerson and drummer 
Clarence Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who while living in New York from 1960 to 1970 played with such premier 
jazz men as trumpeter Kenny Dorham and with the renowned Thad Jones-Mel Lewis 
Jazz Orchestra, in turn has solid praise for Senatore. "Pat is an excellent 
bass player," he said. "I can trust him. When he tells you he knows the song, 
he knows it. He's not going to play the wrong changes. And he's got a feeling 
for the music. Like they say, 'stay within yourself'; well, he does that. He's 
not out there reaching for something that may or may not exist. I can see how 
Herb Alpert liked him, I can see why a lot of people like him. He's a 
musicianly guy, the kind of guy you like to have around." 
</P>
<P>
Drawn to music as a child, Senatore began five years of violin studies at age 5 
-- "I hated it!" -- and then quit, picking up music again at Newark's Arts High 
School, where he played baritone horn, then trombone, then string bass. At 
first he was a fan of the great Woody Herman trombonist, Bill Harris. "We had a 
two-story house and I used to stand at the top of the stairs and play this one 
tune of his, 'Everywhere,' over and over," Senatore said. "Those stairs were a 
perfect echo chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of high school, Senatore switched to bass and after graduation, 
worked for a while before applying to Juilliard, where he went on scholarship. 
He had to play an audition before six musicians, including cellist Pierre 
Fournier and Fred Zimmerman, who was then the principal bassist with the New 
York Philharmonic. "I was so nervous, my knees were literally banging into each 
other. I thought surely I'd flunked. . . . I asked Zimmerman what happened and 
he told me they had an allotment for nine bassists and only seven had applied. 
'Your timing was right,' he said," Senatore recalled with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, with two years of basics from Zimmerman under his belt, Senatore 
headed for the West Coast, where he was soon working, first with unknowns such 
as Eddie Grady and the Commanders, then with the big guns such as Kenton and 
Les Brown. In 1964, with the latter, he traveled to Southeast Asia and Korea, 
as part of Bob Hope's annual Christmas tour for the members of the armed 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Senatore will always remember his tour of Vietnam with Brown. "We played in 
places where there'd be so many soldiers, you couldn't see them all," he said. 
"And they were so appreciative of us being there, I felt like I was 
contributing in my own little way. And after the initial shock of being there, 
what with the bombs and the gunfire and the curfews, it wasn't any problem." 
</P>
<P>
The bassist hit the big time, monetarily at least, when he joined trumpeter 
Alpert's Tijuana Brass for a five-year hitch in 1965. "That was a good gig," 
Senatore said. "I figure I made over $250,000 in five years, and that was back 
then. And at first the music was a ball because it was all new. It was nice to 
have a certain kind of reaction to your playing. The music wasn't the kind I 
wanted to play, but we had fun with it and I got to travel the world." (Alpert 
offered a melange of pop tunes played with a Mexican brass band flair.) 
</P>
<P>
Looking over his varied career, Senatore said, "I don't have any regrets. I 
started out wanting to play jazz and that's what I'm doing now. I'd just like 
to get a little more exposure but maybe that will happen. Really all I enjoy is 
playing that big piece of wood. It's a gas."
