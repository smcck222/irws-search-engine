JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: CAMPUS-SPEAK; 
</P>
<P>
THE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE INSPIRATION FOR COLLEGE SLANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EVERYONE KNOWS that teen-agers speak a sublanguage of their own. Fewer of us 
are aware, I suspect, that college students similarly develop a slang that 
becomes the common language of campus and dormitory life. 
</P>
<P>
The two languages do not necessarily serve the same purpose: Teen slang makes 
teen conversation unintelligible to adults and thus preserves the teen group's 
privacy. College students are not so threatened by the immediate presence of 
their parents, so we must assume that the purpose of their slang is to improve 
and invigorate the language. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Munro, professor of linguistics at UCLA, has sent me a book, "UCLA 
Slang: A Dictionary of Slang Words and Expressions Used at UCLA," which was 
compiled by a dedicated class she taught. (It is for sale for $5 at the UCLA 
Book Store.) 
</P>
<P>
Glancing through it, I infer that slang is indispensable to campus life and 
reflects its nature: There are more expressions for drunkenness, throwing up 
and sex than for any other activities. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, I suspect, that college youths are more given to strong 
drink than the general population, -- though they may be, and being less 
experienced, they may be more likely to throw up. There are more synonyms for 
drunk in the English language than for any other. 
</P>
<P>
Among the printable words for drunk, for example, are blasted, blitzed, bombed, 
ripped, shredded, slaughtered, blown and blotto. You will notice that some of 
them -- like bombed and blotto -- are in the general language and have been for 
a long time. 
</P>
<P>
There is a plethora of demeaning epithets: animal, a wild, crazy person; 
airhead, a dumbbell; beddy, a promiscuous woman; bub, a person with no 
redeeming qualities; Chester Molester, a lecherous man; scary, unattractive, 
repulsive. Also newt, nerd, kook and dweeb, most of which are in the general 
language and define an inept, stupid wimp. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of words meaning to have sex. A few of the printable ones: 
boink, bump, jock, jump and romp. Whether those represent a high incidence of 
sex on campus or merely a high incidence of thinking about it, we can only 
imagine. They do seem to reflect macho male attitudes toward the practice. 
</P>
<P>
A curious phenomenon in the dictionary is the incidence of formal, rather 
out-of-date words that have been revived in their original sense. For example, 
strumpet (a sleazy girl) and inebriated (drunk). Prof. Munro notes that such 
words have returned to life only on campus. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, other standard words have completely novel definitions in 
campus use. For example, grovel means "to make out," and wrap means 
"girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the slang expressions seem childish but rather graphic. "To give 
someone cavities" is to talk excessively sweetly to him or her. To "shake one's 
skirt" is to dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Coke-bottle eyes" is a condition brought on by excessive drink in which all 
members of the opposite sex appear desirable (a not uncommon phenomenon in 
post-collegiate life.) 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the words describing persons are derogatory -- geek, an idiot; 
loon, a weird person; lump, a useless, lazy person -- there are a few words of 
admiration: A goddess is a female achiever, and a god is a gorgeous male, 
although that word also is used in "bow to the porcelain god," meaning to throw 
up. An Adonis is an extremely good-looking male. 
</P>
<P>
Many words and phrases, of course, are related to studies and tests, which 
presumably are sandwiched in between the boozing, barfing and bumping. Most of 
them are in the general language, which suggests that the students are not very 
inventive in academic areas. To ace a test is to pass it with flying colors; to 
mess up is to fail; a mick is an easy class; murder is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
I find few words of genius, and few that seem to have any chance of survival. 
Undoubtedly today's slang is tomorrow's English; but I can't say that today's 
UCLA slang will enrich or invigorate the language of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Munro assures us in her introduction that "almost all UCLA students have 
a full command of standard English, which they use in writing papers and 
talking with older people." 
</P>
<P>
So don't despair.

LOOKS: RISKY BUSINESS?; 
</P>
<P>
THE INCREASING RATE OF IN-OFFICE SURGERY PROMPTS A NEED FOR CLOSER CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO

<TEXT>
<P>
With more cosmetic surgeons practicing here than in any other region in the 
United States, Southern California is the focus of what many doctors are 
calling a chaotic and potentially dangerous situation. They caution that the 
dramatic increase in the number of surgeries requiring anaesthesia performed in 
doctors' offices can leave patients at risk from substandard operating 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
Surgical procedures performed in doctors' offices cost 60 to 75% percent less 
than hospital surgeries. To offer even lower prices, however, some doctors cut 
corners by working with fewer trained personnel, and by eliminating emergency 
equipment such as cardiac resuscitation machines and back-up electrical 
generators. In other cases, sanitation needs go unmonitored. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors who do in-patient surgery can choose to have their office operating 
rooms inspected and accredited, but they are not required to do so. In fact, as 
Dr. Robert Grazer, an associate clinical professor of plastic surgery at UC 
Irvine, points out, "At least the Public Health Dept. checks soda fountains -- 
nobody polices in-office surgical facilities." 
</P>
<P>
There are several voluntary systems for accrediting office facilities, however. 
The American Assoc.for Accreditation of Ambulatory Plastic Surgery Facilities 
(AAAAPSF) is the largest. The Accreditation Assoc.for Ambulatory Health Care, 
Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organizations, and Medicare also 
offer rigid screening programs. "The goal of these organizations is to bring up 
the standards of office facilities," Grazer says. "When more than half of the 
plastic surgeons in California are performing surgery in their offices, some 
controls are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Another cause for concern is that many doctors perform cosmetic procedures in 
their offices even though they are not credentialed to perform the same 
operation in a hospital. Dr. Robert Singer, vice-chairman of surgery at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, calls the doctor's office "a haven from outside 
scrutiny." In hospital settings, surgeons are evaluated by other doctors; in 
most office-surgery situations, there is no form of peer review. 
</P>
<P>
"More than half the people who list themselves as cosmetic surgeons in the 
Beverly Hills phone book don't have the proper training to be doing the work, 
and yet no one is overseeing what they do," says Singer, who recently testified 
before the House Subcommittee on Regulation, Business Opportunities and Energy 
in Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chairman of the subcommittee, is leading an 
investigation into several phases of the cosmetic surgery field, including 
misleading advertising, unqualified practitioners and substandard facilities. 
Singer and other plastic surgeons representing the AAAAPSF have asked for 
government standards defining who can perform plastic surgery and in what types 
of facilities, and calling for mandatory peer review. 
</P>
<P>
Until guidelines are established, consumers should ask to see certificates of 
accreditation for office facilities, or call the AAAAPSF (312-949-6058) for a 
referral to a board-certified plastic surgeon with an accredited in-office 
operating room. "We're not trying to stop office surgery," says Dr. Gustavo 
Colon, vice president of the AAAAPSF and a clinical professor of plastic 
surgery at Tulane University. 'But we do want some form of guidelines for these 
facilities. The patient must be protected."

ROOM-TEMPERATURE DISHES CAPTURE NATURAL UNTAMED TASTES AND TEXTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, Russ Parsons is food editor of the Los Angeles Times 
Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are unmistakable pleasures in eating food served at room temperature, 
particularly when the weather is warm. Foods that can be eaten without cooking 
show completely different qualities than foods that must be cooked; natural 
textures and flavors come through without alteration. 
</P>
<P>
When foods are cooked, flavors are tamed. Colors change, too; they mute into 
pastel shades. Texture is altered. 
</P>
<P>
But foods designed to be eaten at room temperature are served closer to their 
natural state. Ingredients taste the way they are supposed to -- fresh and 
vibrant. Colors are bright and true. Foods that crunch continue to do so. 
Colors are bright and true. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the Italian salad Caprese, a room-temperature combination of 
startlingly red tomatoes, milky-white fresh mozzarella and vivid green basil. 
There is no dish more commonplace, yet few dishes that could be more perfect. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasures of room-temperature food are not just of the palate. There is a 
psychological difference in serving food at room temperature. Because diners 
don't feel an immediate pressure to get it while it's hot, dinners occur more 
leisurely. And because most dishes can be prepared in advance, the cook can 
relax. 
</P>
<P>
In other warm-weather areas, such as Mediterranean countries, food served at 
room temperature is so much a part of the culinary life that it is hard to 
imagine those cuisines without it. In Spain, room-temperature food has been 
elevated almost to the level of religion with the national passion for tapas, 
small between-meal snacks that easily become an entire meal. 
</P>
<P>
But it has taken this country some time to catch on to cool food. In the 
traditional French kitchen, the position of garde-manger (the person who 
prepares composed salads, terrines and other room-temperature specialties) is 
one of the highest in the pecking order. In most American restaurants, however, 
the garde-manger is called a pantry chef, a position at the very bottom of the 
career ladder in the restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, foods that aren't served hot often are brought out ice-cold. Perhaps 
this custom is rooted in a fear of disease. Many people seem to think that any 
food more than five minutes out of the refrigerator or oven is well on its way 
to botulism. In the case of protein foods, of course, there is reason to worry 
-- dishes based on milk, eggs, fish or meat should not be held at room 
temperature for more than an hour. Even so, they can be prepared in advance, 
refrigerated and brought to room temperature five or 10 minutes before serving. 
Other dishes -- based on vegetables, fruits and cereals -- present no problem 
when served at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in most places, foods that should be served at room temperature come 
straight out of the fridge; salads are made with greens as stiff as cardboard, 
and tomatoes have the texture of pool balls. Even pasta salads are 
refrigerated, a horrifying prospect, since ice-cold pasta becomes nothing more 
than cold, stiff, boiled starch. Compare that to a room-temperature pasta 
salad, in which the noodles still have their flex, the olive-oil dressing is 
aromatic and the fresh vegetables keep their natural bite and savor. 
</P>
<P>
In these recipes, the ingredients are cooked just enough to improve them but 
not enough to tame their color, flavor or texture. Served neither hot nor cold 
but at room temperature, they are truly foods to cool summer's heat. 
</P>
<P>
This technique for cooking salmon comes from the well-known French chef Michel 
Bras by way of author Paula Wolfert. A fast and easy cooking method, it leaves 
the fish pinkish-orange rather than dull gray. 
</P>
<P>
OVEN-STEAMED SALMON WITH FENNEL GREMOLATA 
</P>
<P>
3 pounds center-cut salmon fillet, skinned 
</P>
<P>
1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh fennel fronds 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup very good olive oil 
</P>
<P>
3 teaspoons coarse sea salt 
</P>
<P>
Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Adjust racks so there is one near top of oven, 
another lower. Put deep roasting pan on lower rack. Bring pan of water to boil 
on stove. 
</P>
<P>
Cut salmon fillet into 12 approximately 1-inch-wide strips. Put salmon on 
ungreased cookie sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Pour boiling water into roasting pan. Put cookie sheet with salmon on top rack 
of oven. Bake-steam 10 minutes. Turn fillets over and cook another minute. 
Remove from oven; clean any white, rendered fat from fillets, and store on 
covered plate. 
</P>
<P>
To make gremolata, peel lemon with vegetable peeler. Cut zest into thin 
julienne and then into fine dice. Finely mince garlic and add to lemon. Add 
fennel fronds and finely chop all together. 
</P>
<P>
Paint 6 individual serving plates with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and swirl to 
cover serving surface. Arrange two salmon fillets in narrow V on each plate. 
Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of gremolata and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
There is a Sicilian dish called caponata e pana made from stewed eggplant, 
peppers and onions and served with bread. This lighter version combines the 
earthy flavors of grilled eggplant and roasted red peppers with the tang of 
anchovies and the bright flavor of basil. 
</P>
<P>
GRILLED CAPONATA E PANA 
</P>
<P>
4 cups stale Italian bread cut into 1/2-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
4 red bell peppers (or 2 cups roasted red bell peppers) 
</P>
<P>
6 Japanese eggplants 
</P>
<P>
Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Salt and pepper to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Toast bread 10 minutes or until light brown. 
Remove to air-tight container. 
</P>
<P>
Roast red bell peppers over open gas flame, turning slowly to blacken entire 
surface. Put peppers paper bag, close tightly and steam for 15 minutes. Remove 
peppers from bag and peel away blackened skin. Remove stem end and seeds. Cut 
in 5 or 6 sections lengthwise, then in half. Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Cut stem end off eggplants and cut in 1/2-inch diagonal slices. Lightly cover 
with olive oil. Grill under broiler or over charcoal or gas grill until soft 
and lightly brown. 
</P>
<P>
Add eggplant to peppers. Add anchovies, garlic and 1/4 cup olive oil. Toss well 
to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, add bread and mix well. Top with fresh basil, either torn 
in small pieces or cut fine julienne. 
</P>
<P>
Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the nuttiness of the wild rice and the bite of the orange 
juice dressing is a backdrop for an explosion of fresh herbs. It's a twist on 
tabbouleh. 
</P>
<P>
WILD-RICE SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups wild rice 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups chicken stock plus enough water to cover rice by 1/2 inch 
</P>
<P>
2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/4 red onion, sliced paper-thin 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
Juice of one lemon 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt and pepper to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh parsley 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons fresh mint 
</P>
<P>
2 tomatoes, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
In medium saucepan, add chicken stock to wild rice and bay leaves. Add water to 
cover. Bring to boil over medium heat; then reduce to low and cover. Check 
after 20 minutes. If rice needs to cook more and pot is dry, add more water 
(since there is little starch in wild rice, it won't toughen as regular rice 
will). When rice is firm to bite but cooked through, drain in colander and 
remove bay leaves. 
</P>
<P>
While rice is still warm, transfer to large mixing bowl and add red onion and 
garlic. Add orange juice, lemon juice and half of olive oil. Fold rice over 
with spatula to coat with juice and oil. Add oil until rice shines, but not so 
much that extra oil collects in bottom of bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
Cover and chill until ready to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, coarsely chop fresh herbs and fold into salad. (If you do 
it too much in advance, herbs will blacken.) Repeat quickly for tomatoes. Makes 
6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could be simpler -- either in concept or in execution -- than this 
dish. But given perfectly ripe tomatoes, there's also little that could be 
better. 
</P>
<P>
SPAGHETTI SALSA 
</P>
<P>
1 pound dried spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
4 ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
2 jalapeno peppers, charred and peeled 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fresh cilantro 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
Bring pot of salted water to rolling boil. Add spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seed and coarsely chop tomatoes. Coarsely chop garlic, jalapenos and 
cilantro. Combine in small mixing bowl with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Mix 
quickly and add salt. 
</P>
<P>
When spaghetti is cooked, add butter to serving bowl. Drain spaghetti and put 
that on top of butter. Mix well to make sure pasta is well coated. Add 2/3 of 
salsa and mix well. Spoon other third on top of spaghetti. Makes 6 servings.

WINE: CHEERS; 
</P>
<P>
8 VINTAGES LATER, OPUS ONE IS ABOUT TO GET ITS OWN WINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LAWRENCE BALZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OPUS ONE, the much-heralded joint venture of the late Baron Philippe de 
Rothschild of France and Robert Mondavi of California, has broken ground in the 
Napa Valley. Construction of a seven-acre winery has begun. The building, which 
will stand in the center of Opus One's mature 100-acre Oakville vineyards, will 
be, in the words of designer Scott Johnson, "a seamless blend of two cultures, 
of the tastes and desires of two families." 
</P>
<P>
The winery, to be completed in 1991, is the final step in executing a 1979 
Rothschild-Mondavi agreement to produce a Napa Valley red wine embodying the 
features of California's Cabernet Sauvignon and classic Bordeaux claret. 
</P>
<P>
An integral part of the 60,000-square-foot winery will be the first-year-barrel 
cellar -- all 15,000 square feet of it. The cellar will be four times larger 
than most red-wine cellars because Opus One is aged in new French oak barrels 
placed side by side, as is the tradition at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. The 
barrels are not stacked because during the first six months, the new wine is 
topped twice weekly (once a month is the norm in the industry); therefore, easy 
access to each barrel is essential. Topping is the process in which the same 
kind of wine is added to keep the barrel full. The wine also is racked -- drawn 
off from the dregs -- more frequently, four times each year. 
</P>
<P>
The new winery will have the capacity to produce 20,000 cases annually. In the 
meantime, the Robert Mondavi Winery, which has been the production site for the 
past eight vintages of Opus One, including the recently released 1986 ($50), 
will continue to send out about 10,000 cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Opus One ground-breaking ceremony began, members of the nation's 
wine media were invited into the cool barrel-storage hall of the Robert Mondavi 
Winery for a vertical tasting of all editions of Opus One. It was conducted by 
the wine-making team of Tim Mondavi, son of Robert Mondavi, and Patrick Leon of 
Mouton. 
</P>
<P>
For Opus One, Leon and Mondavi always blind-taste as many as 150 lots of wines 
to select perhaps 25 barrels that they feel would make the blended style they 
are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
But the style has been inconsistent. The composition of the wine has changed 
with every vintage. Sometimes there would be no Merlot, and sometimes there 
would be too much Cabernet Sauvignon. The 1980, with 96% Cabernet Sauvignon and 
4% Cabernet Franc, is not yet ready to drink. The makers learned a lesson with 
that wine and gave subsequent vintages decreasing amounts of Cabernet 
Sauvignon, lending it a gentler taste. But then, for reasons known only to the 
wine makers, the percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the '84 edition jumped 
back up -- to 97%. 
</P>
<P>
In the open-discussion period after the tasting, Robert Mondavi posed some 
questions to his son Tim. Some of us winced when he asked him about the "style" 
of the 1984, using the word "clumsy" in his appraisal. But in his own 
evaluation of this very good wine (sitting next to him, I could easily read his 
scoring), the elder Mondavi had given it 18 points out of a possible 20. His 
top rating, incidentally, a 19.5/20, was reserved for the 1986. I, too, had 
given it the same score. That edition contains 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% 
Cabernet Franc and 4% Merlot. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pursuing wines of suppleness and richness," Tim Mondavi said. 
</P>
<P>
And the 1986, with its taste of ripe loganberries, is the finest example of 
that pursuit.

THE PLIA CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT FOLDS AND STACKS -- rarely does one chair do both. The affordable Plia chair 
(named after the Italian word for fold), designed in 1968 by Bologna, 
Italy-based Giancarlo Piretti and made by Castelli (now owned by Krueger 
International) is probably the best-selling "art" chair of all time: more than 
6 million Plias have been sold in its two-decade existence. About 70,000 Plias 
still sell annually. Interviewed during West Week at the Pacific Design Center 
last February, Piretti recalled the design process that gave birth to the Plia: 
"If you look at a conventional folding chair in profile, you'll see that it has 
three joints. I found a way of shrinking the triangular mechanism to a single 
joint, which looked so elegant and beautiful I wanted to make it fully visible. 
That, in turn, led to the transparent seat." 
</P>
<P>
Castelli had trouble ironing out one bug in the chair, however: After years of 
steady use, the early-vintage Plia chairs I owned one by one cracked, 
invariably at a dinner party, under a guest who was just then lifting a glass 
of red wine. In fairness, Piretti points out that the Plia was intended as an 
occasional chair, not to be used as an everyday dining chair. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the chair's engineering ingenuity, what accounts for the Plia's 
astonishing appeal is its transparency, which automatically makes it the 
perfect choice for a cramped apartment, or the chair to place over a beloved 
Persian rug when you can't bear to cover up the pattern. But that transparency 
worried people at first, Piretti said, mimicking a timid expression and 
gingerly settling his weight into the seat. "Other customers never could adjust 
to the transparent seat, so for them we came out with a smoke-colored version." 
</P>
<P>
The Plia chair is available at Bullock's and through Krueger International, 
Pacific Design Center, Los Angeles; telephone (213) 659-2133. Available in a 
chrome or paint frame with seat and back of red, green, white or black plastic 
($118 to $143 retail), clear or smoke transparent plastic ($128) or cane 
($274).

Only occasionally do book reviews contain a sentence or brief paragraph from 
the author of the book. Your expertly selected stories give one a feeling of 
the authors' works.

The outstanding illustration with each story is also profoundly effective. And 
the cover by Jim Heimann is a delightful change -- so cool and refreshing.

Kudos to you for devoting an entire issue to new California prose. The mix was 
excellent. The magazine should now give equal time to the poetry of our region. 
Certainly this would include more of author Kate Braverman ("Falling in 
October"), but let us have a summer reader representing the best of eclectic 
Los Angeles to round out the sampling of the major new voices of Californian 
writers.

ELVIS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've just returned from Memphis, Tenn., and I can assure you the real Elvis 
Aron Presley is gone forever. Any chance the general public had of 
understanding the sensitive yet frustrating 42 years of Presley's 
apprenticeship on this planet is now disappearing inside a "freak show" the 
former Mrs. Presley continues to call Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
"Eternal Revenue," by Robert Hilburn (June 11), featuring the post-mortem 
merchandising of Elvis' name was, in itself, a fine piece of journalism. 
However, people planning to visit our beloved Elvis' Tennessee mansion in the 
future should not be under the impression that current Presley estate trustees 
have created anything more than another tasteless, inaccurate forgery of Elvis' 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps during her lifetime, Lisa M. Presley will defy the selfish ambitions of 
her mother and other Presley estate "Cling-ons" in order to seek out and 
publicly present a more historically accurate account of her father's legacy.

REMODELING: AROUND HOME; 
</P>
<P>
BUYING HARDWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
REMODELERS ARE FACED with a bewildering choice of materials, most of them 
fairly bland. Why not opt for a natural substance with deep, rare colors and 
patterns? Why not try wood? 
</P>
<P>
Wood, always a basic element of house building and furniture making, is all too 
often relegated to a supporting role. Yet hardwoods of all types are easily 
found in Southern California -- hardwoods that can be the crowning touch to a 
new fireplace mantle, a strip of molding to highlight an entryway, a special 
table you've always wanted to try your hand at building. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing the right hardwood can make or break a project, not to mention a 
pocketbook. A lumberyard carrying hardwood might have a mix of as many as 60 
different domestics (ash, walnut, the many varieties of oak) and exotics, 
including such intriguing types as ziricote, Pernambuco, bubinga and koa. 
Prices range from less than $5 a board foot (12 inch square by 1 inch thick) 
for birch, maple and red oak -- most popular with remodelers -- to $28 for true 
exotics such as macassar ebony. Some are even sold by weight: Pink ivory from 
Zimbabwe sells for about $25 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"Buy the best quality you can buy," says Richard Mandroian, owner of Arroyo 
Hardwoods in Pasadena. "On a remodeling project that is going to take 
significant time and effort -- as well as cost several thousand dollars -- it 
doesn't pay to save $50 or $75. You're only cheating yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye on the end result: Variables include grain, texture and darkness as 
well as color. Another tip: Find a lumberman whom you trust, one who will tell 
you, for example, the difference between Honduras mahogany -- a true mahogany 
-- and African mahogany, a less expensive substitute. The latter won't have the 
easy workability of Honduras mahogany, nor show as interesting a grain after 
finishing. 
</P>
<P>
There are woodworkers who feel a special relationship to a choice piece of 
wood, who believe that every tree has a soul. There is a piece of hardwood out 
there that deserves to live again -- in your living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Find hardwoods at House of Hardwood in West Los Angeles; Arroyo Hardwoods in 
Pasadena;MacBeath Hardwood in Montebello; Austin Hardwoods in Santa Ana; Davis 
Moulding (limited selection) in Oxnard, and Frost Hardwood Lumber Co. in San 
Diego.

NATIVE AMERICAN BEADWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FROM THE BEGINNING, long before the arrival of Europeans in the New World, 
Native American tribes were producing magnificent beadwork. Tribal artisans 
(mostly women) worked with shells, stones and porcupine quills. They used 
almost any material that could be strung or attached to cloth or buckskin: 
shells, seeds, berries, stone, bone, teeth, plant resins, glass, metal ivory, 
ceramic and even dried otter's liver. 
</P>
<P>
Plain or decorated, each bead was wound, woven, inlaid or stitched to a variety 
of materials. Before 1850, beadwork generally consisted of large white, black 
or blue "pony beads." Smaller glass beads, or "seed beads," were developed 
after that date and led to further refinement of the craft. In general, the 
best work was done between 1870 and 1890. Oddly enough, commercial glass beads 
from Italy were introduced into the Southwest by the Spanish around the middle 
of the 16th Century, and centuries later they were brought in from 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated beadwork was consistently produced by the Indians of the Great 
Plains (the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, among others) and the Great Lakes 
areas. Beads were used by the Southwest Indians more sparingly, though often to 
greater effect; thus an Apache blouse and skirt might have a single band of 
blue and white beads outlining an ochre-colored cloth area. 
</P>
<P>
Beadwork decorated a variety of objects: Arapaho moccasins; Sioux deerskin 
dresses; Apache ceremonial costumes and headbands; Hopi kachina dolls; Crow 
handbags for holding the mirror, hair-parting stick and face paints needed by a 
young man for dances and other social occasions; Sioux embroidery vests; 
Cheyenne boots with the "lazy stitch" to produce narrow lines; Comanche women's 
boots with light-toned stitching; Cheyenne doctors' fans; Jicarilla Apache 
shirts with beads in black and white; Ute bandoleers; Crow lance cases, and, 
perhaps most glorious of all, Great Plains war bonnets and decorated cradle 
boards from the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Though beadwork is generally not expensive, there are some compelling 
exceptions. At a November, 1988, sale at Sotheby's, for example, a pair of 
beaded Seminole leggings sold for $60,500, something of a record. Of course, 
beadwork from tribes of the Eastern and Southern United States is much rarer 
than from the Great Plains and the Southwest, but Native American art of all 
kinds is undervalued today. There are still many splendid examples for the 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Native American beadwork at Taos Indian Trading Co., Wounded Knee 
Gallery, Nonesuch Gallery and Federico in Santa Monica; Native American Art 
Gallery in Venice; Don Bennett Antique American Indian Art in Agoura; Sun Stone 
Gallery in Laguna Beach; Indian Store in Anaheim; Ojai Indian Shop in Ojai; 
Mike Haskell (Peregrine Galleries) in Santa Barbara, and American Indian 
Gallery in San Diego.

MERRY-GO-ROUNDS

<P>
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS become a haven for much-traveled vintage carousels. A 
ride on a merry-go-round is a thrill for children, and the tinkly music of a 
carousel band organ can evoke childhood summer memories for adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Spillman carousel in Los Angeles' Griffith Park was built in 1926, but some 
of its horses were carved by Charles Looff, the godfather of carousels, before 
the turn of the century. Its fine Stinson Military band organ has a repertoire 
of more than 1,500 tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Looff built the Shoreline Village carousel in Long Beach in 1906. 
Originally located in Seattle, it was moved to San Francisco's Playland in 
1914, where it remained until 1973. Now housed in a replica of Looff's original 
hippodrome, its menagerie of jumping camels, rams, giraffes (and, of course, 
horses) has real horsehair tails and Belgian cut-glass "jewels." 
</P>
<P>
One of the last places you can catch a brass ring is at the carousel at Balboa 
Park in San Diego. The 1910 Herschell-Spillman Co. carousel moved south from 
Los Angeles to settle permanently in Balboa Park in 1922, arriving at its 
present location next to the San Diego Zoo in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Seaport Village is the home of the Broadway Flying Horses, an 1890 
Coney Island William F. Mangles and Charles Looff carousel, originally powered 
by a steam engine. The horses were refurbished by artisans who used automobile 
paints blended in the colors of the original palette. The turn-of-the-century 
Gebruder Bruder Waldkirch band organ has also been restored. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 years old, the Dentzel carousel, with 52 hand-carved animals, is 
featured at Castle Amusement Park in Riverside. For many years it was located 
at Knott's Berry Farm. Music is provided by a Ruth band organ, which was 
rescued from the old Long Beach Pike. The 1922 carousel on the Santa Monica 
Pier was manufactured by the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., and was made famous in 
the movie "The Sting." 
</P>
<P>
 Catch a ride on an old-fashioned merry-go-round at the following locations. 
(Hours of operation will be curtailed when school resumes, after which most 
will be open only on weekends. Rides cost 75 cents unless otherwise noted.) 
Griffith Park carousel in Los Angeles is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. 
Santa Monica Pier carousel is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday through 
Sunday; rides are 25 cents for childern, 50 cents for adults. Shoreline Village 
carousel in Long Beach is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Balboa Park 
carousel in San Diego is open from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Broadway Flying 
Horses at Seaport Village in San Diego is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. 
Castle Park in Riverside is open from 6 to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 
from 6 p.m. to midnight Friday, from noon to midnight Saturday, and from noon 
to 10 p.m. on Sunday; rides are about 70 cents for children, $1.05 for adults.

Regarding the passage in the July 24 article on former brokerage house chief 
Boyd L. Jefferies ("Boyd Jefferies in Exile") teaching youths to play golf, 
please tell me the following quote was a misprint: 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing a darn good job of making potential citizens out of them." 
</P>
<P>
Does he really mean to imply that learning the rules of golf will elevate the 
learner from a born citizen to a "potential citizen?"

COLUMN ON SMART &amp; FINAL IGNORED COMPANY'S SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I read Harry Bernstein's labor column of Aug. 1, "Many Americans Share 
Miners' Problem," I was dismayed to find that untruths, half-truths and 
innuendoes had been so freely used to attack Smart &amp; Final Iris Corp. and 
falsely portray the facts and circumstances of its current labor situation. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein never requested comment from either myself or, to my knowledge, any 
other Smart &amp; Final representative. Had he done so, he would have been 
provided the following information contradicting the "facts" presented: 
</P>
<P>
First, Smart &amp; Final never "refused to continue paying health-care premiums 
for retirees." Health care was provided to retirees under the terms and 
conditions of the Teamster/Employer Health and Welfare Trust. Smart &amp; Final 
only contributed on behalf of active employees. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, when negotiations broke down and Smart &amp; Final implemented 
its final offer, the trust advised us that they could no longer accept 
contributions for active employees and had unilaterally elected to terminate 
coverage for retired employees. We felt this decision was in direct violation 
of the terms and conditions of the trust and proceeded to file suit in federal 
court on behalf of all retirees in order to compel continued coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In June, when it became clear to me that the lawsuit would not be quickly 
resolved, I informed all retirees by letter that Smart &amp; Final would assume 
responsibility for all medical coverage until the lawsuit was resolved. I 
realize that the image of retired persons being denied medical care makes for 
sympathetic prose, but it is clearly a far distance from the truth in this 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Bernstein makes reference to Smart &amp; Final leaving certain 
"employer associations" to gain competitive advantage over its "industry 
rivals." Smart &amp; Final did belong to the Food Employers Council, or FEC, a 
group of retail supermarket operators, when it owned the Thriftimart operation. 
When Thriftimart closed, the reason for belonging to the FEC ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Smart &amp; Final is clearly a different operation with different needs than a 
retail supermarket chain. We sell products in large quantities to business 
customers, have no butchers or retail clerks and use different methods of 
distribution. As a result, we resigned from the FEC in 1984 and did not 
participate in the FEC negotiations last October or in the previous round of 
negotiations in 1985. It is difficult to gain a competitive advantage against 
"rivals" with whom we do not compete. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Bernstein accuses Smart &amp; Final of "reducing the wages and 
benefits of active workers." He fails to mention that the wage offer that Smart 
&amp; Final did implement in February of this year actually pays more per hour 
to its employees than the "industry" contract. He also neglects to mention that 
when that offer was extended to Smart &amp; Final employees, over two-thirds of 
them left the picket lines and returned to work. Further, that offer did not 
"reduce" anything. In fact, Smart &amp; Final has gone out of its way to 
provide the same (or in some cases better) benefits than the previous contract. 
</P>
<P>
Given the ready availability of the facts in this case, I must conclude that it 
was Bernstein's intent to serve Teamster interests without regard to the truth.

The July 21 article about the crises besetting UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, 
"Iowa Crash Is Latest Crisis for United Chairman Wolf," reported on the 14 
months of negotiations between United Airlines and its pilots union, but you 
neglect to mention the lengthy bargaining between United and the Assn. of 
Flight Attendants representing the 13,000 flight attendants employed there. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have continued for 23 months, the last seven months with the 
assistance of a federal mediator. Early in July, the flight attendants voted 
overwhelmingly to strike if an impasse in bargaining occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between United and the International Assn. of Machinists, the 
other union on the property, is up for renewal later this year.

WATERGATE THEN AND NOW: HOW QUICKLY THEY FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David R. Gergen, David R. Gergen, editor at large for U.S. News &amp; World 
Report, led President Richard Nixon's speech writers in 1973-74. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Richard M. Nixon waved his last farewell from a White House helicopter 15 
years ago last week, Deborah Gore Dean was still a teen-ager, taking a 
summer-school course at Georgetown University while working part time as a 
hostess in a restaurant. Joseph Strauss was preparing for his first year in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
Probably they weren't watching that August night in 1974, as Nixon told a 
stunned and saddened nation he was resigning from the presidency, and didn't 
see him the next morning when he bade a tearful au revoir to his staff. If they 
did watch, they surely didn't listen because Dean and Strauss are both fingered 
today as major figures in the scandal breaking over the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. They were part of the "brat pack" that recklessly 
scattered millions of government dollars among influential Republican friends. 
</P>
<P>
As the nation marks the anniversary of Nixon's departure, there is an eerie 
sense in Washington that the wheel has come full circle. Somehow the lessons of 
Watergate, as searing as they seemed at the time, did not sink deeply enough 
into the public psyche. Some people like Deborah Dean were so young they never 
learned -- even though Dean's mother became John N. Mitchell's regular 
companion more than a decade ago. Other people just forgot or decided they were 
above the law. 
</P>
<P>
How else can you explain why Washington is again steaming with scandal? So far 
this year, the city has seen the first resignation of a Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, who left under darkening clouds; the first rejection of a new 
President's Cabinet nominee, also under fire for his behavior; the criminal 
conviction of a White House national security aide, who almost brought down his 
own President; continuing investigations of bribery in Pentagon programs; 
revelations of gross mismanagement and profiteering at HUD, and passage of a 
massive bill to clean up the scandal-ridden savings-and-loan industry. There 
may be more to come this fall with new fireworks in the HUD affair. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of these misdeeds goes far beyond the $1,200 likely to be charged 
every taxpayer to clean up the S&amp;Ls. As during Watergate, confidence in the 
integrity of the system is eroding. That's one reason why hefty majorities have 
been telling pollsters that even though they like George Bush, the nation is on 
the "wrong track" and they don't trust Washington. The public will never OK a 
much-needed pay raise for Congress until convinced that Washington has cleaned 
up its act. Why reward thieves? 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the legacy of Watergate is not wholly bleak. Some reforms of the 
last 15 years have proved effective. Both the executive and congressional 
branches operate far more openly today, heeding Justice Louis D. Brandeis' 
dictum, "sunlight is the best disinfectant." Some argue that openness has been 
carried to excess, discouraging negotiations on such sensitive subjects as the 
budget -- but by and large, the new approach has served well. So has the 
Freedom of Information Act, with requests for government documents and records 
now routinely granted. Conflict-of-interest rules still need to be tightened 
and clarified for members of Congress, but they are more stringent for 
presidential appointees than in the early 1970s. The large majority of states 
have also strengthened rules for open meetings and conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
From a White House perspective, one of the most important changes is how 
difficult it now is for a President or his staff to manipulate three of the 
most powerful government agencies for domestic purposes. No longer is the FBI 
in the business of wiretapping or snooping on a President's enemies, as during 
the Nixon years and in previous Democratic and Republican administrations. Tax 
returns are no longer scanned for personal dirt at the Internal Revenue 
Service. And the Central Intelligence Agency is out of national politics. There 
are still occasional misdeeds -- charges of bribery now swirl around some IRS 
agents -- but abuses by the White House have generally been curbed. 
</P>
<P>
It is arguable that other reforms undertaken in the name of Watergate, as well 
as the Vietnam War, have gone too far. Convinced an "imperial presidency" was 
endangering the nation, Congress began asserting its power during the early 
1970s. It insisted on overseeing and regulating minute details of 
executive-branch policy. 
</P>
<P>
To carry out this new mission, Congress in the past 15 years has expanded its 
staff from 16,000 to 24,000. But hardly anyone is pleased with the results: 
Cabinet officers are so tied down by their micromasters on Capitol Hill that 
they can't act and Congress is so enmeshed in the chaos of its own making that 
it can't lead. In the case of one reform, the War Powers Act of 1973, even some 
leading congressmen now acknowledge that too much authority is invested in the 
legislature. Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and John Warner (R-Va.) introduced 
legislation last year allowing the President greater flexibility in committing 
troops to combat. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most remarkable feature of U.S. political life 15 years after 
Watergate is how scandal-ridden Washington is once again. Some reforms of the 
post-Watergate era have failed -- especially the attempt to remove the 
influence of money from politics. Driven by the higher costs of campaigning in 
a television age, politicians have connived with special interests to make a 
hash of campaign finance laws. Individual fat cats may no longer bankroll 
politicians, but political-action committees can be even more pernicious in 
their influence. PACs not only exercise influence through direct contributions 
but also work their will indirectly through each party's national campaign 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for example, built itself a 
war chest by raising money from PACs representing the S&amp;L industry. The 
S&amp;L scandal might never have metastasized to the degree it did had 
Washington politicians not become so beholden to contributors from the thrift 
industry. Both the Reagan Administration and Democratic leaders in Congress 
delayed action on S&amp;L legislation for an unconscionable period because of 
close ties to their S&amp;L friends. 
</P>
<P>
When Nixon was reelected by a landslide in 1972, private contributions to the 
congressional campaigns totaled less than $100 million. By 1988, private 
contributions for those campaigns ballooned to $476 million. No wonder 
corruption is breaking out again: So much money sloshes through the system that 
people are easily bought. With good reason, pressure is building for public 
financing of congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
It would be reassuring if the current round of scandals could be cleaned up 
with another round of reforms. But it isn't that simple. Human memory also 
plays a role. Just as Teapot Dome began fading from the nation's consciousness 
within a few years, so too has Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to Oliver L. North testify about his hours at the shredding machine 
was like listening to a child who had never heard of John W. Dean. He seemed 
oblivious to the fact that obstruction of justice brought down one President 
and could easily do in another. And how numb to history was Fawn Hall, his 
secretary, as she stuffed confidential documents in her boots so they would 
never be found. Did she not remember the troubles of poor Rose Mary Woods? 
</P>
<P>
Or consider Deborah Gore Dean. Did it never occur to her that she was leaving a 
paper trail as incriminating as Jeb Stuart Magruder's when she jotted down all 
the HUD projects she wanted to steer toward political cronies? 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, who lost the most, has remembered Watergate better than anyone. Its pain 
will never leave him. But he hasn't hidden from the world, trying to erase 
people's memory. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon has worked steadily to rehabilitate himself through his public writings 
and he has come a long way. Others of that day -- H.R. Haldeman, John D. 
Ehrlichman, Charles Colson -- have also worked to repay their debts to society 
and cleanse themselves. Yet even they would argue that each new generation 
needs to relearn the mistakes of Watergate so that they aren't repeated. It 
seems perfectly clear.

UC TENURE: A FOREST OF DEADWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Miles, Jack Miles, a former professor, is The Times' book editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig asked last month whether 
California was getting its money's worth from University of California faculty 
who teach as few as six hours per week. He complained about the faculty member 
who says, "I'll do my research and you leave me alone." Honig argued, "That's 
not good enough. The people of the state are paying the bill . . . and they 
deserve a better accounting." 
</P>
<P>
Honig is right, but the situation is worse than he may realize. Many UC full 
professors do not teach as many as six hours per week, year-round. Typically, 
they teach six hours during two quarters, three hours during a third quarter 
and zero hours during the fourth (summer) quarter. Those who do maintain a 
heavy schedule of research, I hasten to add, are fully employed even at that 
modest level of teaching. Yet many professors do no research at all during time 
bought for them by the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Honig questions the quality of UC research: "You look at the published stuff 
some of these guys do and you wonder if it's all that valuable." For the 
moment, forget quality and only consider quantity. During nearly seven years as 
an editor with the University of California Press, I had abundant contact with 
the best of the UC faculty; a perennial topic in their conversation was 
"deadwood" -- the distressingly large number of their colleagues who did no 
research but, in effect, took state money and ran. 
</P>
<P>
I am not talking about the most senior or junior professors, who, for good and 
different reasons, might be less than abundantly productive. I am talking about 
people in their prime who "haven't published anything in years," to use a 
phrase heard with alarming frequency. 
</P>
<P>
Deadwood is a drag on academic competitiveness. It is also, obviously, an 
affront to elementary ethics. The amount of teaching required of a UC full 
professor simply does not constitute full-time employment. Any tenured 
professor who does his teaching and stops there is a thief. What else do you 
call someone who takes money for work and then doesn't do it? 
</P>
<P>
In any other walk of life, someone who -- over the years -- failed to discharge 
a major portion of his or her responsibilities would be fired. UC professors 
who fail to do research are not fired. What protects them is tenure, that 
munificent guarantee of lifetime employment bestowed on the fortunate after 
only six years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
But if tenure prevents dismissal, it does not prevent another corrective 
response. Once a tenured professor at a research university is clearly doing no 
significant research, that professor should be stripped of full-time pay for de 
facto part-time work and be required to teach full time. 
</P>
<P>
This "punishment" would scarcely be cruel or unusual if the teaching load were 
pegged at the level required of faculty at the Cal State system -- 12 hours of 
teaching (plus three of advising) per week. 
</P>
<P>
Nor would such change create the "two-class faculty" of teachers and 
researchers that one Berkeley dean has warned Honig about. Such a division, in 
fact, already exists. Just ask professors who work long hours on research how 
they feel about those colleagues who, with perfect impunity, go golfing 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reform would address the most notorious consequences of the status 
quo: the ever-rising cost of higher education. At California State University, 
Long Beach, where enrollment is 33,700, according to "The College Blue Book," 
full-time faculty numbers 950. At UCLA, where enrollment is 33,167 (same 
source), full-time faculty numbers 2,100. If UCLA faculty time not actually 
spent on research were claimed for teaching, that university would need fewer 
faculty. Alternatively, it could enroll more students without hiring new 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
The "punishment" of extra teaching would not end the research career of any 
serious professor. One early discovery at UC Press was the outstanding research 
being done in various parts of the Cal State system, the supposed "teaching 
system" of the state. A given department on a given Cal State campus might well 
rival its UC counterpart. Shift the comparison to the level of individual 
professors, and all old bets were off. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, many UC departments began to be "tenured in" -- all members 
holding lifetime employment, all still too young to die or retire. Bright new 
Ph.D.s from the best universities turned perforce to the less prestigious Cal 
State campuses, bringing their research plans with them. An acquiring editor 
interested in publishing the best new work, no matter who was doing it, could 
find plenty of possibilities at the erstwhile teaching campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The teaching load on those campuses is heavy. It does interfere with -- but 
does not preclude -- research. At Cal State San Diego, for example, an English 
professor with a research project may request three hours of "assigned time" to 
work on it, bringing classroom hours down to nine per week. Not all such 
requests are approved, though most are; nor do all professors make such 
requests. In one exceptional case, a professor was recently granted six hours 
of "assigned time." 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State San Diego approach to research accountability contrasts sharply 
with the usual UC approach -- granting a senior professor a 50%-75% reduction 
of the benchmark 12 hours of teaching per week, whether reducation is requested 
or not. A tenured UC professor is, in effect, presumed to have this much 
research in progress. The professor who has quietly set research aside in favor 
of real-estate investing or horse breeding may eventually pay the price in slow 
promotion or smaller raises, but not in increased teaching. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a natural symbiosis between teaching and research, as spokespersons 
for research universities rightly claim, then purely in the interest of 
teaching, the state would do well to allocate more of its research money to the 
Cal State system. By the same token, once it becomes clear that a given UC 
professor either cannot or will not do significant research, the state is 
surely within its rights to double that person's teaching load. The UC faculty 
clubs play host each day to a number of living, breathing, serenely aging 
tenure mistakes. Everyone knows them. Behind their backs, some laugh at them 
and more complain about them. Here is a way to make them less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Honig is right to question the proposed expansion (from nine campuses to 12) of 
the UC system. California has experienced no explosion of demand for new 
university research. If it had, the proper response would be research 
institutes -- without gymnasiums, dormitories, student health center, student 
union and other student services. What the state faces is an explosion of 
demand for the kind of high-quality university education the UC system manages 
to offer at a relatively low price. 
</P>
<P>
The demand, in other words, is for extra teaching. Then why overlook surplus 
capacity already in place? The state could redeploy the unused, paid-for time 
of dormant UC research faculty in the form of new hours of university teaching. 
If there is such a thing as found money, there may also be such a thing as 
found time.

QUAYLE LOBBYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was alarmed to read about the "unsolicited lobbying" for specific American 
companies in Indonesia and Thailand performed by Vice President Dan Quayle in 
The Times("Quayle Lobbied Foreign Nations for U.S. Firms," Part I, July 30). As 
noted in your article, this sets "a new precedent" in the arena of vice 
presidential foreign relations -- and for good reason! 
</P>
<P>
No vice president has ever done this before because the others had the sense to 
realize that plugging specific companies at high-level meetings sends a 
confusing and misguided message to foreign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Are they to believe that they will wrest some political or financial gain from 
the U.S. government if they "make a deal" with Quayle? 
</P>
<P>
Now, the argument given by Paul Freedenberg, who believes Quayle has initiated 
a great plan, is that "it's a good way of getting attention for U.S. companies 
at high levels. We're running a $130-billion (foreign trade) deficit." This 
shocking statement implies that since we have spent our way into a huge 
national debt it's time to throw away all reason and sense and sell off the 
office of vice president to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
How, may I ask, is the vice president going to choose the next company he 
lobbies for? What attempts will U.S. companies now make to "get on the VP list" 
for foreign lobbying? And what if President Bush decides to join in? Our 
government is rightly concerned with improving U.S. company shares in foreign 
markets. It is unfair and dangerous, however, to lobby for individual companies 
at high-level meetings with foreign leaders in order to achieve this 
improvement.

It is an epochal chapter in the long history of human exploration. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m. on the night of Aug. 24, the spacecraft Voyager 2 will pass within 
3,000 miles of the planet Neptune's cloud-enshrouded north pole. At that 
moment, 12 years and 4 days into its historic flight, nearly 3 billion miles 
from its home, the craft will again share with the men who sent it the sights 
no one has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager, the most sophisticated robot ever built, consists of 65,000 different 
parts and a computer so sophisticated that it can heal itself when damage 
threatens its mission. But on that day of man's first encounter with the most 
distant of the outer solar system's great planets, the craft will be so far 
from Earth that, even though they travel at the speed of light, its 
photographic transmissions home will take 4 hours and 6 minutes to reach the 
network of 38 antennas on four continents arrayed to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager is the greatest in a series of unmanned space probes whose 
accomplishments are unique in the annals of man's exploration of his physical 
universe. Their journeys over almost unimaginable distances are adventures of 
the human mind, but not of the human body. Theirs are the feats of daring 
intellects and dazzling ingenuity, and not of the body's courage or endurance, 
as all such stories of exploration in far places have been before. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of their monumental achievement, man -- the creator left behind -- 
also is left to wonder what exactly this new experience is? Is he the prime 
mover or merely the spectator to the machines' first great adventure? 
</P>
<P>
Those of a romantic bent might argue that while Voyager has stored up 
scientific treasure, it has done little to enrich the human spirit -- that the 
project's triumphal elevation of the machine has degraded mankind from an 
explorer to a consumer of exploration. That, we think, is a narrow, even 
vulgar, view, one that reduces adventure to mere sensation and exploration to a 
kind of trial by combat. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager, in all its magnificent accomplishment, is but the latest reminder of 
the fact that in all things that really matter, what man's mind can grasp far 
exceeds the reach of his frail body.

A SYMBOLIC THUNDERHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was there something prophetic, perhaps, about the giant thunderhead that camped 
over the Los Angeles Aqueduct late last week dumping rain that swept tons of 
mud, rock and other debris into the canal that is the water lifeline for 3 
million Angelenos? As it happened, nature shut off the water just as the people 
of the Owens Valley were deciding whether to approve a second attempt to reach 
a long-term agreement with the City of Los Angeles over how much water the city 
Department of Water and Power could extract from the valley and send south. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it happened, the tropical clouds wrought their wrath on the aqueduct 
just as negotiators in Sacramento reached tentative agreement on limiting the 
city' diversion of water from the Mono Lake basin just north of the Owens 
Valley, and providing a means for the city to buy replacement water elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Just coincidence, of course. But, in fact, the storm may symbolize the unspoken 
undercurrent of hostility in the sparsely populated eastern Sierra region 
against the City of Los Angeles more emphatically than the public comments 
about the two related water issues. The opposition that erupted this spring 
against the first Los Angeles-Inyo County draft agreement on the city's pumping 
of water from the Owens Valley was surprisingly intense. That sent county and 
city negotiators back to the bargaining table. The new plan that emerged this 
past week was considerably improved from the standpoint of the 20,000 or so 
residents of sprawling Inyo County. Barring surprises, it will win approval 
from the Inyo County Board of Supervisors at a meeting Tuesday and then go 
before the Department of Water and Power's governing board and the Los Angeles 
City Council for ratification. The new plan gives Inyo County considerably more 
authority to curtail or halt the city's pumping from Owens Valley aquifers if 
there is direct evidence that the water table is being depleted to the extent 
that the valley's sparse vegetation is drying up. A primary goal of the pact is 
to prevent further damage than has been caused in 75 years of Los Angeles water 
withdrawals from the Owens Valley. That is a major victory when viewed in the 
perspective of recent years. And much will be heard from the city in the future 
about the sacrifices it must make in both water and money to satisfy Inyo 
County's demands. 
</P>
<P>
In historic perspective, the city's concessions are minimal. Both the law and 
the public mood have shifted dramatically in recent years away from the concept 
of absolute water rights and toward environmental protection. In this sense, 
the tentative agreement to protect Mono Lake from past levels of water 
diversions by the city is a landmark. It establishes the concept that all the 
citizens of California should help pay to maintain a remarkable state 
environmental asset. This would be achieved by giving the city money to buy 
water from other sources to replace that portion of its Mono basin supply 
needed to maintain a healthy lake level. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy for the city to claim that the tail is wagging the dog -- that 
it is unfair for the tiny citizenry of two far-away California counties to 
restrict the vital water supply of the emerging economic capital of the Pacific 
Rim for selfish and narrow environmental reasons. There is, in fact, 
considerable fear in the Owens Valley that some day some judge will decide just 
that, and the proposed 51-page agreement worked out over the past five years 
will be just meaningless words on paper. That should never have to happen, 
however, if California's ample water resources are managed with imagination and 
care. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of today is that no single entity can expect to exercise absolute 
demand on another region's water. Both the Owens Valley and Mono Lake 
agreements will bring a measure of fairness and balance to a complex water 
equation. The City of Los Angeles should approve and honor them with pride, and 
not just the grudging acceptance that has been exhibited to date.

Finally a picture of abortion painted by a man who obviously cares about women. 
A man who is not pro-abortion but pro-choice. I have no problem with that 
concept. And my guess is that most women, even the most liberal, would agree 
with Regas. Women are not interested in frivolous abortions as those pro-lifers 
lead us to believe. They are interested in their right to having control over 
their bodies. And what in heaven's name is wrong with that?

'A PRIEST ON ABORTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As is sadly the case with every pro-choice advocate I have ever heard or read, 
Regas completely ignores the detrimental effect abortion has had on many women. 
He knows "women whose lives were literally saved from unraveling emotionally" 
because they chose abortion; I have known women whose lives unraveled because 
of that choice. I have wept with women who are filled with regret and anguish 
over their abortions. I have heard women cry, "if only it hadn't been so legal, 
so easy, I would have never made this mistake." 
</P>
<P>
I have met women rendered sterile by legal, "safe" abortions. Out of this sort 
of pain and anguish, many post-abortion support and counseling groups are 
springing up all over the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the pro-abortion side ignore these hurting women? Perhaps it is 
because that side does not even hear them. Women who suffer emotional and 
spiritual trauma either struggle alone or seek out those who they know will 
treat them with compassion. It never ceases to amaze me how many in the 
pro-life camp are women who have had abortions. 
</P>
<P>
On one point I must agree with Regas: "The society we seek says all life is 
sacred everywhere, for if it is cheap anywhere, it is cheap everywhere." That 
is why I will continue to be an advocate for the unborn: For if you attempt to 
cheapen the precious life I am now carrying, you cheapen my life as well, and 
the lives of the newly born, the aged, everyone. And no one who calls himself a 
disciple of Christ could possibly allow that.

I am so pleased to read Regas' most sensitive and informed views on abortion. 
It is important to me, and to people like me, that religious leaders break 
their silence (because most are pro-choice) and speak out in defense of a 
woman's right to choose. 
</P>
<P>
I am a baptized and confirmed Episcopalian. Thank you, Father Regas, for making 
me feel proud of the church I was brought up in. You inspire me to share a bit 
of my own story. 
</P>
<P>
I had a safe, legal abortion a year ago. It was a very difficult decision that 
I arrived at only after much prayer and introspection. Those who would make 
abortion illegal claim that abortion in this country has become too easy an 
answer. They push for more restrictions in the hopes that women will make what 
they consider to be moral decisions. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing easy about being faced with an unplanned pregnancy (no matter 
what solution is chosen) and there is nothing moral about decisions that are 
forced upon us. In my own case I know this to be true. My situation was painful 
and serious enough without the added danger of illegal abortion as the only 
alternative to carrying an unhealthy and possibly unsafe pregnancy to term. I 
ache for women who are poor and alone, because they are the ones who will 
suffer the most from the Supreme Court's most recent decision. 
</P>
<P>
Because I was not coerced by lack of funds or government restrictions, I was 
emotionally able to hear the answers to my prayers. With those answers I made 
what was the most moral and loving decision -- for me and for the potential 
human life I was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, Rev. Regas, for reminding us that women must be allowed to make 
these most intimate decisions for themselves.

SHORT TAKES: STILL SWINGIN' AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The suffix of his telephone number is 1937. By design. "I asked if they had 
something between '35 and '55," Chuck Cecil says. "They said, 'We have 1937.' I 
said, 'Great.' It was the year (Benny Goodman's) 'Sing Sing Sing' was recorded, 
and (Bunny Berigan's) 'I Can't Get Started.' A very good year." 
</P>
<P>
Cecil, who has bopped around the radio dial some since the cutoff date of '55, 
has landed on KMPC, to the unalloyed delight of those who insist the world's 
greatest pop music was played in the '30s, '40s and (reluctantly) some of the 
'50s. Cecil does not count himself among them. He likes all music, even 
today's, though his program "Dance Party" (7 to midnight Saturday nights) 
centers on the swingin' years. 
</P>
<P>
Down from Oregon by way of San Luis Obispo, Cecil, now 66, landed his first Los 
Angeles job in 1956 on KFI. "They terminated me in '72." He left? "No, they 
fired me. The manager said 'Don't feel bad; we're terminating the Dodgers, 
too.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was at KFI, though, that Cecil chanced upon the formula that's sustained him 
for 30 years. "Outside of Sinatra, Billy May, a few others, contemporary music 
wasn't going anywhere in '56," he says. "Rock was just starting, and KFI wasn't 
about to play that. We had a listener poll: One card preferred contemporary; 
about 100 said, 'We like the old stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
From KFI, Cecil took his old stuff to KGIL, syndicated "The Swingin' Years" (42 
stations at last count) and finally went to KMPC, where the patter between the 
priceless platters is unequivocally live. ("We have a request for a good 
rendition of 'Winchester Cathedral.' There's no such thing.") "I got a note the 
other day," Cecil says, "saying how nice it was to hear a show in such an 
unstructured setting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
His own favorites? "Lunceford is so joie de vivre," he says. "Goodman: I can 
hardly wait to play 'Benny Rides Again.' There's times when just the mood of 
Basie or Miller hits the spot. James gets that heart-cry into his trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, though, I like it all. They say today's music is repetitious and loud, 
but you know, it's more exciting loud. You're feeling a little down and you're 
driving to work and sometimes all it takes is a little volume." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Share Your World' -- in Living Color 
</P>
<P>
Remember your first big box of Crayolas -- a flip-top box of what seemed to be 
an infinity of hues, each with an exotic name like ocher, burnt sienna, 
Cincinnati red, Georgia brown? Maybe you, too, just looked at them, loathe to 
blunt all those fine points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the Crayola people have been providing an incentive to plunge 
two-fisted into the box: a series of contests culminating in some impressive 
prizes (two $25,000 scholarships for openers). This year's coloring theme is 
"Share Your World"; last year's -- winners just announced -- was "My Favorite 
Wish," with the wishes just as colorful as the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Among top Southland contestants, Joellen Moe, 6, of Los Angeles writes, "I wish 
unicorns were real." Fletcher Cork, 6, of Concord wishes "we could have 
rainbows when it isn't raining." Jackie Gordon, 6, of Long Beach longs to lead 
a parade; Kevin Whitesides, 11, of Fountain Valley yearns to be a 
paleontologist, while Jennifer Earl, 11, of El Cajon goes for all the marbles: 
"My favorite wish," she wrote, "is to be queen of my own island." 
</P>
<P>
All of which, company spokeswoman Mary Mullane opines, "are very California, 
don't you think?" Possibly, when compared to an Iowa boy's wish "never to be a 
fly in a Venus Flytrap," or another Midwestern lad who wishes only that "my dad 
would get out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
For at least one nascent artist, meanwhile, reality has outdistanced desire. 
Summer Thompson, 10, of San Diego wishes there were no fences or freeways. The 
accompanying drawing is a striking pastel dreamscape with uncanny overtones of 
Chagall. The Hallmark people thought so, too, and signed her to a greeting-card 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Getting the Lie of the Land in Book Form 
</P>
<P>
 -- A man who sucked 326 flies out of the air with the business end of an 
ordinary household vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A woman who ran her 1989 Honda over 641 beer bottles before getting a flat 
tire. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A sportsman who "bowled a 600 game and has the credentials to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
World records? Absolutely, Dennis Beattie says. Is he kidding? "Of course," 
says Beattie, who runs Fancy Fonts, a copy center cum publisher in Garberville, 
Calif. Fancy Fonts hopes to print the initial "Liars' Book of World Records and 
Astonishing Feats" in 1990, depending on how many submissions Beattie is able 
to corral. 
</P>
<P>
There's not much to do in Garberville ("population 3,000 on a good summer day, 
counting all the tourists"), and "we were sitting around one day spinning yarns 
of our own," Beattie says. Like most stories, they'd gotten better and better 
with time -- not necessarily more truthful; just better. "We figured if we 
collected some of the taller tales it'd be a neat little thing to read. Readers 
complain, 'This book is full of lies.' Here's one that really is." 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to solicit whoppers, 100 words or less, with $15 "recording fees" 
that entitles the liars to a book discount. "One thing I do know," Beattie 
says, "is that people like to see their names in print. Like the guy who says 
he was the first to surf Hawaii's 'Pipeline' -- while wearing roller skates; 
the woman who claimed to have triple-looped on a windsurfer at the Columbia 
(River) gorge; another man who stands 6 (foot) 4 and insists he's the world's 
tallest midget. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Why a fee? "Didn't your mother ever tell you that if you tell a fib you've got 
to pay for it?" And what if there aren't enough submissions to permit a viable 
book? Will Beattie refund the $15 fees? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," the publisher says. "Would I lie to you?" DICK RORABACK

ROGER SIMON: AIRING A GRIEVANCE OVER AIRLINE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the little things in life that count. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh-cut flower from a loved one by the side of your morning cup of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The hand-lettered card on your birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The cheery "Have a nice day!" from your letter carrier as he passes you on the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I have never experienced any of these things. But I have had a full 
can of Coke on an airline. 
</P>
<P>
A few words of explanation: Two years ago, I mentioned in yet another 
earth-shattering column that one reason I liked Piedmont Airlines was that they 
gave you a full can of Coke for free when you flew and not just a little 
plastic cupful. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a full can of Coke is too much for a short flight. But it was the 
thought that counted. And I once switched airlines for this very reason and 
figured out a full can of Coke cost me only $304. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was a nice gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Those of you who follow the financial pages know that more than two years ago, 
USAir bought Piedmont and has been working out the merger of the two airlines 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
They had to mesh reservation systems and training procedures and even redesign 
their cockpits so pilots from both airlines would feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the biggest problems was what to do about the free cans of Coke. 
According to the Charlotte Observer (Piedmont was based in North Carolina), the 
Coke issue was a very serious one. And USAir Chairman Edwin I. Colodny once 
ducked the question "when asked about one of the most burning issues in the 
minds of Piedmont passengers." 
</P>
<P>
I know this sounds like a joke, but it wasn't. Many of Piedmont's passengers 
liked the airline for the same small reason I did: Piedmont gave you something 
it didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
And it makes you wonder why more corporations don't earn good will that way. 
(Piedmont did not fail because of its policy of giving away Coke, by the way. 
It did not fail at all. Both Piedmont and USAir were doing well when they 
merged.) 
</P>
<P>
Remember the bakery shops that used to throw in an extra cookie for the kids 
even when all you got was a couple of loaves of bread? 
</P>
<P>
Remember the gas stations that used to give away free maps? 
</P>
<P>
Remember the salespeople who used to say, "I'll check in back and see if I can 
find that for you" instead of, "Everything we got is on display!" 
</P>
<P>
Small things. Small things people remember. 
</P>
<P>
Still, USAir did not want to give away free whole cans. They offered little 
plastic cups and they didn't see any reason to change after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said adopting Piedmont's policy would require keeping 30,000 cans 
on hand per day and the cans would add (a teensy bit) to the airliner's weight 
and crowd the galley. And we all know the galleys have to be kept clear to make 
room for the meals that airlines no longer give us on short hops. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, USAir said, if you wanted a whole can, all you had to do was ask for a 
whole can. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure. What people are going to ask for a whole can and risk the possibility 
of abuse? It does not happen in the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
You ask for a full can and you are likely to hear: "Don't you realize that I am 
not a flying waitress? That I am here to pull you from the wreckage should we 
crash and burn?" 
</P>
<P>
Which is what all airlines should realize today. Flying has become one of the 
worst forms of travel, even worse than driving. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't use to be this way. Flying used to be fun. A pleasurable adventure 
rather than a white-knuckle one. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's awful. Planes are packed. Services are reduced. (How many times 
have you been told you can't hang your garment bag in the front closet because 
that's reserved for first class?) And we read these little stories. Stories 
about a crew having a risque conversation in the cockpit and forgetting to 
extend the wing flaps with the resulting crash of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know anybody who still enjoys flying. And the jokes I heard just a few 
years ago don't seem so funny now: "Gee, airlines, today. You get to the ticket 
counter and they ask you: 'Non-smoking. Smoking. Or burned to a crisp?' " 
</P>
<P>
So airlines should realize we don't like to fly on them. We fly on them because 
we have to. Because we can't take the train to Paris. And because we believe in 
confronting our fears. 
</P>
<P>
And this is why airlines should treat us nicely. Extra nicely. They should not 
only give us the minimum (tail sections that stay attached to the fuselage) but 
wretched excess (a whole can). 
</P>
<P>
So I am delighted to report that after much soul-searching and argument, USAir 
decided to continue Piedmont's policy. You can now fly on their planes and get 
a full can of Coke. 
</P>
<P>
Now if they'd just switch to Pepsi.

ZAN THOMPSON: BROUGHT TO HER KNEES -- TEMPORARILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has always been the delight of Peaches, my mixed-breed companion who is half 
Maltese terrier and half poodle, to jump from chair to couch to hassock and 
back, the feathers on her legs and her tail fluttering like pennants on 
tournament day. 
</P>
<P>
Now, her exuberance and pure delight in being has brought her to grief, which 
seems like a grumpy stroke of fate. 
</P>
<P>
This unkind consequence came to light the other evening when she jumped off the 
bed and let out a scream like the noon whistle down at the foundry. She 
continued this high-pitched wail in spite of my soothings. At length, she 
quieted down, but it was plain that all was not well. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, we went to the vet. Dr. Susan Dietrich is a small young woman, 
dynamic and reassuring. She told me that she would be off for a couple of weeks 
for orthoscopic knee surgery because of an overexuberant slide into second base 
in a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as I still gimp along on my prefabricated knee (I did not destroy my 
knee by jumping from one piece of furniture to another, but by dancing in the 
theater), I couldn't help thinking that Peaches was in iffy company for a small 
dog with a bad knee. No one in the room had a full set of working joints. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dietrich took Peaches away to the innermost passages, from whence I could 
hear her anguished cries. When Dr. Dietrich returned, she said that flexing 
Peaches' knee revealed that she had turned the ligament in her left knee to wet 
breakfast food. That is exactly what I had done to mine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dietrich said: "This is something that happens to small dogs and small 
people. They overextend themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dietrich herself is no bigger than a tuppenny bit and I have never been 
called stately. Peaches is about 12 inches from toe-tip to the crown of her 
head. So there we three stood with our hurting knees and our short stature. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dietrich said that Peaches would have to have surgery on her left knee, 
just as I had. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Dr. Dietrich has had her surgery, which was highly successful and I 
have talked to Dr. Woody Walker, who says that they will make Peaches a new 
ligament from the layer of muscle along her thigh and that in four to six weeks 
she will be able to put her weight on that leg, which she can't do now. It is 
scheduled Monday. We had to wait until two veterinary surgeons were available 
to do this operation on this tiny dog. 
</P>
<P>
She is three-legging it around the house and yard at a good clip. Dr. Warren 
says animals are good patients and they work out their own therapy. 
</P>
<P>
I should really have my right knee replaced because it is the one that hurts. I 
was thinking of mentioning it to Dr. Diehl but every time I get close to it, my 
right knee is miraculously free of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Peaches, in the meantime, is taking people pills for the pain or else I'm 
taking her pills. In any case, we are on the same medication. 
</P>
<P>
We are both in excellent hands for our knees. I don't think my attitude is as 
good as that of the small blond dog.

ON VIEW: POLO PARTY A HEAVENLY ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think this is as close to heaven as most of us are going to get," said 
Katherine Abercrombie (her husband, Stewart, was in polo whites) as she and her 
co-patron chairwoman Cecelia Dalsemer, wearing a Faberge gold double-horse pin, 
looked about at the beauty of the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club in 
Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
Skies were blue-blue, mountains purple, grass Van Gogh green, the polo ponies 
playful, and chairman Tommie Spear was putting the finishing touches on the 
Braille Institute Auxiliary of Santa Barbara gala luncheon before the Robert 
Skene Invitational Polo Match. 
</P>
<P>
The party brings out Santa Barbara bluebloods. Some had attended Una Noche de 
Gala, the 29th traditional Fiesta Ball planned by Beverly Jackson a few nights 
earlier at the Coral Casino in Montecito, and some had been to the Amy and Bob 
Adams Fiesta dinner at Hope Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
That's the good life in Santa Barbara. Joan Neville came up from Newport Beach 
to house-guest with Tommie and Kellogg Spear. Winslow Maxwell's house guests 
were John and Jeannette McCarty of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent in the crowd, too, were newly appointed Ambassador to Jamaica Glen 
and Gloria Holden, Harold and Annette Simmons (he's making the move to buy 
Lockheed), Molly Danielson of Hope Ranch, Bob (the famous 10-goal polo player) 
and Elizabeth Skene, Francis and Patty McComb, Richard and Rosemary Bergen, 
Frank and Katharine Miller, Frank and Jean Mallory, Dulce and James Harris and 
Adele and Bob Mairs. 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary president Eunice Fly, whose husband, Tom, is president of the Bank of 
Montecito and knows everyone, did the honors when it was time to award the 
crystal trophies to the polo players. Among recipients was three-goal player 
Greg Araneta, who was joined by his wife Irene (daughter of Ferdinand and 
Imelda Marcos). 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDIT: Just when we think Rockwell A. Schnabel, U.S. ambassador to Finland 
until last February, and his pretty wife, Marna, are coming home to roost in 
the contemporary home in Brentwood designed for them by architect Frank Gehry, 
it's necessary for them to do double residence in Washington, D.C.'s 
Georgetown. That's because he's been named undersecretary of commerce for 
travel and tourism. The former ambassador is former president of Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards Group, Inc. and former deputy chairman of the board of 
Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy &amp; Gardner, Inc. (now Wedbush Morgan Securities). 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL WINDS: What a reunion. Jane and Bill Petersen (she's the former Jane

WEIGHING ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT, CANCER RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am one of those women who takes estrogens and progestins to treat my severe 
menopausal symptoms, so I was very interested to read your coverage of the 
hormone/cancer connection ("Weigh Hormones' Risk, Experts Urge" by Janny Scott, 
Aug. 4). 
</P>
<P>
Let me just say that without estrogen I would be a basket case. I could not 
work and would have to apply for disability. One thing the article did not 
mention is that estrogen is also a mental tonic. Without it, I suffer from low 
mental acuity and inability to concentrate, severe hair loss, healing of 
something as small as a paper cut is very slow. I feel that there is more to 
estrogen and other hormones for women that our esteemed medical profession is 
aware of. So, I will take my chances and would rather enjoy some quality of 
life even if it means having a short life due to potential onset of a cancer.

DOLPHIN SLAUGHTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, The Times serves as the apologist for the destruction caused by the 
commercial tuna fishing fleet. Sunday's Cousteau Watch column (Aug. 6) refers 
to tuna fleets that "kill ocean-going dolphins by inadvertently catching them 
in purse-seine nets." This could not be farther from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The international tuna industry deliberately sets these highly destructive nets 
on schools of dolphin to trap the tuna swimming below. There have been 
documented cases in which thousands of these gentle and graceful creatures have 
been killed to net a handful of yellowfin. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Mammal Protection Act has gone virtually unenforced through both 
Democratic and Republican administrations. Observers on U.S. ships are 
regularly harassed, and there are no provisions to observe foreign flag vessels 
which comprise the bulk of the fleet. Dolphins, in the meantime, are being 
eradicated in certain coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
Your article quotes nearly 2 million killed in our own coastal Pacific waters 
since the act passed in 1972. These "official" figures are provided by none 
other than the tuna industry. They do not take into account under-reporting (by 
some estimates by as much as 100%) and the untold millions of mangled and 
near-drowned victims released to a certain death. The disruption of these 
intelligent creatures' social order once set upon by the tuna nets compounds 
the disaster by allowing ever-present predators to finish the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing industry remains the last great industrial hunter of wild animals 
in their natural habitat. One by one, industrial hunting has endangered or 
destroyed important species: whales, seals and sea lions, elephants, buffalo, 
alligators, wild dogs, and on and on. The MMLA has good intentions but does not 
go far enough to protect the remaining cetacean wildlife from destruction, 
especially when enforcement is non-existent.

WEIGHING ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT, CANCER RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could the cancer risk associated with hormone replacement therapy, as it is 
practiced presently, have something to do with the source of material from 
which these hormones are manufactured? The risk of cancer is but one adverse 
side effect experienced by women who ingest the popular estrogen compound 
available on the market. Other unpleasant symptoms are edema, the inability of 
the liver to metabolize lipids, headaches, rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure 
and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, estrogen properties are being extracted from the urine of pregnant 
mares. While this estrogen is somewhat close to human estrogen in structure, 
there are molecular differences great enough to be of concern. Why don't we put 
pressure on the pharmaceutical firms to come up with something more closely 
resembling human hormones? The smaller doses of the mare-produced hormone are 
not the answer.

MARRAKECH, Morocco 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as the walls of this ancient city change color from ocher to shrimp to a 
soft mauve as the sun moves across the sky, life within the ramparts pulses 
with a varying tempo as the hours roll by. 
</P>
<P>
Morning springs alive from the minaret of a mosque as a muezzin calls the 
faithful to the first of five daily prayers shortly before dawn, adding "prayer 
is better than sleep" to the simple litany that praises Allah and Muhammad 
throughout the day. The early hours also bring a mixed and heady, almost 
overpowering, bouquet of the roses and jasmine that blanket the town. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-afternoon sees the labyrinthine alleyways and colorful souks of the old 
medina erupt with merchants, artisans, farmers and tradesmen, all hawking their 
wares with fierce determination and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
Still later in the day, hordes converge on Djemaa el Fna, a gigantic square 
where jugglers and acrobats, Berber dancers and water sellers, snake charmers 
and storytellers entertain well into the balmy night. 
</P>
<P>
Marrakech, southern gateway to the Sahara, is one of old Morocco's four 
Imperial Cities and, like Fez, Meknes and Rabat, has served as the country's 
capital at one time or another during three millennia of turbulent history. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vibrant, mystical and unbelievably beautiful city lying amid palm 
groves before a backdrop of the snowcapped High Atlas mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly KLM, Iberia or Lufthansa to Casablanca, Royal Air Maroc on to 
Marrakech. Royal Air Maroc also flies nonstop New York-Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give yourself at least three days to see and feel all that 
Marrakech has to offer, perhaps another for forays to the desert and High Atlas 
towns to the south. Accommodation costs are moderate; so is dining on marvelous 
Moroccan food. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Morocco's dirham recently traded at 8.53 to the dollar, about 
12 cents each. Come any time of year, and while mid-summer gets very warm, it's 
a dry heat. Walk the medina, take a horse carriage for $6 an hour exploring the 
town, or grab a taxi after you've agreed on the fare for your destination. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Tichka (Semlalia; $72 B&amp;B double) is a stunning 
study in Moroccan architecture inside and out, with a soaring lobby above 
marble floors and columns, magnificent public rooms adorned with local pottery 
and handicrafts, a gorgeous fireplace of intricate tile patterns in one lounge. 
</P>
<P>
There's a feeling of intimacy throughout, bedrooms beautifully done in native 
fabrics, some hand-painted furniture. A towering domed kiosk holds down one end 
of the pool, with tables set around it for outdoor dining. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel N'Fis (Ave. de France; $57 double) is Moroccan-contemporary, having many 
bedrooms with balconies stacked in tiers around a central pool and outdoor 
dining terrace, scene of a formidable luncheon buffet. The cool marble lobby 
has a tile fountain at the center, lots of leather couches and ottomans about. 
The slight drawback at N'Fis is a full measure of tours. 
</P>
<P>
Palais el Badia (Ave. de la Menara; $49 double) is pure contemporary outside, 
again built around a central pool-garden area, with vague overtones of Moroccan 
decor within. Bedrooms have two large double beds, many with a doorway to 
private gardens. There are Moroccan and international restaurants, a bright 
coffee shop with large still-life arrangements of fruit on each table, as well 
as three clay courts for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Moroccan meals usually start with a thick and 
nourishing soup, often made of beans (harira) or lentils and flavored with a 
piquant mixture of herbs and spices. You won't find a menu without lamb, either 
barbecued whole, as kebabs or made into a heady stew in a tajine, a covered 
clay pot placed over a charcoal fire. 
</P>
<P>
Couscous, a dish of steamed semolina mixed with lamb or chicken and vegetables, 
comes close to being the national dish. It is marvelous when flavored with 
raisins. Hot mint tea is the national drink, while a blanc de blanc wine 
(L'Oustalet and Coquillages are fine brands) goes well with everything at 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Fine dining: Hotel La Mamounia has a Moroccan restaurant that's a small 
pleasure dome of Moorish architecture, furnishings and food. Start with the 
harira Marrakechia, the traditional soup previously mentioned. Then perhaps a 
couscous, pigeon stuffed with almonds or a tajine of lamb in a tomato coulis. 
There's also a nightly show of traditional music and belly dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Chez Ali (just outside town) is a bit of a misnomer, as it's really a desert 
camp of tents surrounding a huge corral where Berber horsemen perform after 
your meal. You dine in the tents while reclining on ottomans, the typical food 
served in great quantities and served beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
After the meal there's a troupe of dancers that moves from tent to tent with 
their musicians, at times involving guests in the dances. Then everyone moves 
outside to the corral where 26 Berber horsemen ride full tilt toward you on 
their Arabian steeds, traditional six-foot rifles raised high as they fire 
ear-splitting volleys. It's a wonderful evening that no visitor should miss. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room of Hotel Tichka, a riot of bright colors and Fez tiles, is one 
of the prettiest rooms in town. The menu is a mix of Moroccan and French 
dishes: tajines, stuffed pigeon, civet de lapin (a rabbit ragout), gigot 
d'agneau (leg of lamb) and pastries from both countries. The atmosphere is 
pleasant, a background of soft piano music at lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Hotel La Mamounia (Ave. Bab Djedid; $185-$296 double) has 
been acclaimed one of the world's finest hotels since a multi-million-dollar 
refurbishing. It's set on 18 acres of gardens just within the old city walls. 
The Art Deco style in bedrooms, lounges, restaurants and bars reflects the 
hotel's 1923 birth. The decor is given strong overtones of a sultan's palace by 
exquisite tile work, fabrics, art and artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
La Mamounia has six restaurants, four bars, a gigantic pool, tennis courts, 
casino and fitness center. But the opulence that oozes from every room, and the 
beauty of gardens with olive trees first planted in the 12th Century, are what 
take your breath away at one of Africa's loveliest hotels. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start in the cool of morning with a visit to La Bahia Palace with 
its tranquil patios and handsome courtyards. Reigning visirs (prime ministers) 
kept up to 40 of their favorite ladies here. At sundown the ladies would gather 
in the courtyard and wait for the visir to toss down his handkerchief. The 
catcher received the honor of sharing his bed that night. 
</P>
<P>
Drive by the 12th-Century Koutoubia Mosque, its minaret the highest in the 
city, then on to the Menara Gardens and olive groves beside a huge reflecting 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
The souks of Marrakech's medina, like most in Africa, are almost impossible to 
visit without a guide. Bargaining is the order of the day, with no set rules 
for purchase price, which can be as low as 20% of the figure first asked. The 
best buys are carpets, ethnic jewelry, woodwork and rustic leather items. 
</P>
<P>
Wander from the medina into Djemaa el Fna square and move from one group of 
performers to another, giving your camera a thorough workout. Then go up to the 
terrace balcony of Cafe Glace, have a cooling drink and look down on the 
moiling, throbbing crowds below as cymbals clang, drums thump, dervishes spin 
in ecstasy and cobras undulate to the wavering tones of a flute. There is 
surely no other place quite like Djemaa el Fna in the world. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Moroccan National Tourist Office at (213) 
271-8945, or write (421 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills 90210) for a brochure on 
Marrakech with map and list of hotels and restaurants, another on all of 
Morocco. Ask for the Marrakech package.

THE BARGAIN CORNER: TRANSPORTATION CARDS FOR AUSTRIA AND GREECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greece and Austria have launched discount transportation cards for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek card, which must be bought in Greece, covers both rail and bus 
travel. It is good for 10, 20 or 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
During this consecutive-day time span you get unlimited second-class travel on 
the rail system and on the bus network. Passes are available for one to five 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the current value of the dollar, rates for one person are $40 for 10 
days, $60 for 20 days and $89 for 30 days. The cost for two, three or four 
persons is based on the single rate. For example, the cost of a 10-day pass for 
two people would be $80. 
</P>
<P>
For a group of five, however, the cost is $100 for 10 days, $125 for 20 days 
and $195 for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the discount off regular rail and bus prices is about 45%, according 
to the Greek National Tourist Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Greece also is a member of Eurail, with this pass good for unlimited rail 
travel in Greece as well as 16 other European countries. The Eurailpass also 
offers various bonuses, including ferry rides to some of the Greek islands. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Greek National Tourist Organization, 611 West 
6th St., Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Railway Network has introduced a Rabbit Card that allows travelers 
to choose any four days out of a 10-day period for unlimited travel on its 
system. The Rabbit Card also is valid for boat trips on Lake St. Wolfgang and 
narrow-gauge trains throughout Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The pass also provides a 50% discount for boat trips on Lake Constance, and on 
all scheduled boat service on the Danube River within Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the pass is approximately $99 first-class and $68 second-class. 
Until the age of 26 you can get a junior version of the Rabbit Card for $53 
first-class and $38 second-class. 
</P>
<P>
The Rabbit Card can't be bought in the United States, but can be at major train 
stations and travel agencies in Western Europe. Payment would have to be in the 
currency of that country. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Austrian Railways has dropped its nine- and 16-day rail passes that 
were on a consecutive-day basis. You can still buy a 30-day pass, allowing 
unlimited rail travel within that period, for about $538 first-class and $238 
second-class. Austria is also part of the Eurail system. 
</P>

sonnet and in his longer poem, "The Prisoner of Chillon," hugs the eastern end 
of Lake Leman (best known as Lake Geneva) a few kilometers from here. 
</P>
<P>
Byron created an unforgettable portrait of Francois Bonivard, who languished 
for four years in the Chillon castle dungeon. Even if not exactly true to the 
facts, the poem is a heart-rending statement of a man's devotion to his 
religious beliefs and a splendid introduction to one of Europe's most exemplary 
castles. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon, even without Byron's testimony, imposes itself upon one's 
consciousness. Three semicircular towers of the 13th Century dominate its 
exterior wall, while from the center of the fortress the castle keep rises 
above them. Edging in from the lake, the waters of the moat offer a tranquil 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The interior opens the darker aspects of castle life -- the dungeon, torture 
chamber, gibbet and arsenal, as well as its lighter side -- the banquet and 
receptions halls, bed chambers and chapel. 
</P>
<P>
These are aged spaces; they echo with stories of counts and dukes, of revelry 
and religiosity, of a spirit of long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon is a "restored" castle, to peg it correctly. The Bernese of Switzerland 
shored it up after a strong earthquake in 1584, but it was the archeologist 
Albert Naef, helped by detailed plans that showed the changes through the ages, 
who did the major work of restoration at the end of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Chillon served many functions. At one time a fortress, a lookout, a princely 
residence, an administrative center, prison and arsenal, the building -- 
perforce -- always needed a bit of remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, judging from coins and other remains founded in excavations in 
1896, probably used the rock as an outpost. Later generations recognized the 
strategic position of this little islet: Between the lake and the mountains it 
stood above the narrow road that led south into Italy. It was an ideal spot for 
defense and to collect taxes on goods that passed that way. 
</P>
<P>
The castle keep, an old tower of refuge, probably was built in the 11th 
Century; on the land side -- the most vulnerable point of attack, the 
formidable towers, comprising a second exterior "curtain" wall, were added two 
centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that the House of Savoy held dominion over this part of 
Switzerland, and its counts made Chillon their ducal residence. The Bernese 
ended all that in 1536 when they captured the castle from their Catholic enemy 
and in the process freed its most famous prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls; 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand feet in depth below 
</P>
<P>
 Its mossy waters meet and flow; 
</P>
<P>
 Thus much the fathom-line was sent 
</P>
<P>
 From Chillon's snow-white battlement, 
</P>
<P>
 Which round about the wave enthralls: 
</P>
<P>
 A double dungeon wall and wave 
</P>
<P>
 Have made -- and like a living grave. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prior of St. Victor's, Francois Bonivard had been imprisoned by Duke 
Charles III of Savoy because he favored the Reformation and wanted to introduce 
it in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Byron, who visited Chillon in 1816, cast the situation in his poem, taking a 
bit of artistic license in the process. By then, Byron's celebrity 
notwithstanding, the castle had seen its better days; it was fast becoming a 
neglected anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
Years later the restoration changed all that, and today's visitor, with only a 
soupcon of imagination, can easily move back a few centuries in time. 
</P>
<P>
The old moat, having been cleared of detritus from the ages, still laps its 
water against grassy shore and stony wall. One crosses it via a covered bridge; 
it replaced the old drawbridge that must have succumbed to too many foot 
soldiers, too many closings and openings. 
</P>
<P>
Stately courtyards flanked by several levels of ceremonial halls and living 
quarters fill the upper floors, while down below, on the less penetrable lake 
side (surely the dankest part of the castle) the dungeon spreads its gloom. 
</P>
<P>
"There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,/ In Chillon's dungeon's deep and 
old," wrote the poet. But the vaulted ceiling and the columns of unembellished 
stone speak of a harmony, a quiet aesthetic, that belongs as much to a church 
as to a dungeon. 
</P>
<P>
From 1532 to 1536 Bonivard was here, chained to one of the pillars. The pillar 
still stands, close to the one where Byron, in the tradition of graffiti makers 
through the ages, carved his name. Now, 173 years later, the poet's name merits 
a glass-enclosed case, and like most graffiti, appears indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the dungeon, castle restorers found the ruin of what was the 
original chapel, a tiny structure hiding such fragments as a delicate shrine 
and a Carolingian altar stone. 
</P>
<P>
Up above, the rooms evoke the more princely side of medieval life: the Hall of 
the Chatelain (the high bailiff), with its handsome windows and pillars from 
the Savoy period; the Bernese chambers, with their decorative 16th-Century wall 
patterns of flowers and birds, and the Hall of Knights, once the grand 
reception hall for the Savoyards, and later the official room of the Bernese 
high bailiffs of Vevey, lords of the castle, who made Chillon their residence 
from 1536 to 1733. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernese coats of arms are set in the walls; the Bernese added a large 
fireplace and mullioned windows that overlook the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the halls serve as museums, wherein are displayed artifacts from the 
Middle Ages and early modern Europe: a musket from 1600, stone sculptures found 
in the moat and four large models that show the rock as it was, the first 
construction in the 9th Century -- after Chillon's strategic site became 
apparent, and the subsequent alterations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the oldest parts of the castle is the keep, a place where defenders of 
old could always, as a last resort, barricade themselves in its highest 
reaches. Builders over the centuries tried to make it all the more formidable, 
adding stories until it reached its present height of 86 feet. 
</P>
<P>
During the restoration its walls had to be reinforced. When they were opened, 
restorers found 50 large franc pieces minted during the 13th Century. One 
wonders whether they were deliberately put there for future generations to 
discover, or whether they were tucked away in some final act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
It is a relatively easy climb up the gnarled wooden steps that lead to the top 
level of the keep, and from there one commands a panoramic view of the castle 
with its courtyards and machicolated towers, the lake, and, hovering above it 
all, the mountains. These are the same mountains that Bonivard, climbing up to 
a small window, looked at with such longing: 
</P>
<P>
 I saw them -- and they were the same, 
</P>
<P>
 They were not changed like me in frame; 
</P>
<P>
 I saw their thousand years of snow 
</P>
<P>
 On high -- their wide long lake below, 
</P>
<P>
 And the blue Rhone in fullest flow; 
</P>
<P>
 Bonivard's story, preserved in Byron's stirring lines, no doubt represents 
only one among the many that might be whispered from the walls and battlements, 
from the rooms and courtyards of Chillon. For Byron, for today's visitor, the 
castle stands as a venerable and remarkably authentic testament to another age, 
another spirit. 
</P>

<P>
The Castle of Chillon is at the eastern end of Lake Leman about 90 kilometers 
from Geneva. A train from Geneva Airport can get you to Chillon in less than an 
hour; the drive by car along the northern edge of the lake, via Lausanne, takes 
about an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Montreux, about two kilometers away, along with Vevey a little to the west, are 
the main resorts at this end of the lake. The cities offer an exciting night 
life -- casinos and discos as well as a full range of hotels in all price 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
The Hyatt Continental and the Hotel Excelsior are among the deluxe hotels. Just 
three minutes away from the castle is the Bonivard, a 19th-Century hotel 
recently refurbished. Many of the hotels offer packages: three days and two 
nights, starting at $75 U.S. per person. Weeklong packages also are available. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreux-Vevey area is the scene of several festivals: the Montreux 
International Jazz Festival in July and the Montreux-Vevey Classical Music 
Festival from late August until early October.

ROAMING ROMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We recently returned from two weeks in Romania. Here are a few facts that were 
not found in any travel book that we had read: 
</P>
<P>
If driving into Romania from Vienna in a rented car through Hungary, remember 
to ask for a "leaded" gas tank, as there is very little unleaded gas in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Buy your hotel vouchers before entering an Eastern European country. They offer 
a real saving, as they "fix" the room rate, plus give you a ration of gas per 
day. Every book talks about the vouchers, but does not stress that you must buy 
them before your trip. The Romanian embassy in Vienna has them. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if you want milk in your coffee or tea, you had best take along a 
condensed kind, as dairy products are very scarce. The country is magnificent. 
We skipped going on to Bulgaria to stay longer in Romania.

REMOTE WOLF POINT RANCHES TRY TO SNARE VISITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE COHEN, Cohen is a free-lance writer living in Durango, Colo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WOLF POINT, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard as it may be to believe, Amtrak does stop here. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 3,074, Wolf Point is also the smallest city in the United 
States offering regularly scheduled, commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
But the rails are the lifeline in this expansive agricultural region known as 
Missouri River Country. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged in by the North Dakota border and Canada to the north, Wolf Point's 
wheat farmers and cattle ranchers might seem an unlikely presence on the 
tourism bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
But in these tough times for America's small farmers, promoting tourism as an 
adjunct to farming is one way Wolf Point and the surrounding communities are 
attempting to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is big out here -- the prairies, the cultivated fields, the sky. 
There are few trees in any direction to break the view. Parents routinely drive 
children 50 miles for a piano lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, long isolated by the sheer size of their properties, usually build a 
spare house or two to accommodate help. Today, with the farm economy down and 
farmers being paid by the government not to grow, these spare homes sit empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help With Chores 
</P>
<P>
Wolf Point isn't a tropical resort, but you can rent a furnished two-bedroom 
house for $150 a week. If you wish, you can help with ranch chores such as 
calving or branding. Or just read a book, take a walk or do nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
This is a part of Montana that few people visit. In Missouri River Country, you 
will be hobnobbing with working people, not polished tour guides, and you'll 
get a glimpse inside the skin of a community that is not exactly the hub of 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of remoteness is ever present. You can gaze 100 miles across the 
rolling Missouri River breaks and study the approaching storm clouds. Thunder 
echoes and lightning crackles. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee at the General Sherman Motor Inn -- the town's largest motel -- is 35 
cents. Steak and eggs, with juice, toast and coffee, tops the menu at $4. 
</P>
<P>
So what does one do after breakfast in Wolf Point? 
</P>
<P>
If you are staying in John Rabenberg's $150-a-week furnished spare house, you 
might go flying with your host. He has a private landing strip on his ranch, 
and for a small fee takes passengers for rides. He also can supply motorbikes 
or horses. 
</P>
<P>
Rabenberg's place is only one of more than a dozen cattle, hay or wheat ranches 
in Wolf Point with an extra house for rent. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the season and the sort of ranch work being done, visitors can 
watch or participate in branding, cattle drives, planting, harvesting and other 
ranch chores. 
</P>
<P>
Another effort to cope with changing times in Wolf Point is being waged by 
Louis Taovs. Beneath a green baseball cap, Taovs' eyes twinkle as he leads 
visitors through what he claims to be the largest and most complete collection 
of John Deere farm equipment in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deere Collection 
</P>
<P>
Taovs' collection overflows 14 cavernous sheds and includes at least one of 
everything Deere ever made, dating to an 1892 steam tractor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spotlessly well-kept collection includes 500 tractors, Model A 
and T Fords, the complete Mark series of Lincolns, and hundreds of odd antique 
water pumps, grinding wheels and assorted farm paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
It is all currently on display at Taovs' LLL Ranch, but not for long. Last 
summer, the Burlington Northern Railroad donated 25 acres to the Wolf Point 
Chamber of Commerce for an industrial park and permanent museum to house the 
Taovs' collection. 
</P>
<P>
Other visitors stroll down Main Street to Gene Martin's Wolf Point Saddlery 
(213 Main St.). Martin has been making saddles by hand for 40 years. He 
explains each step in the custom-fitting, cutting and shaping processes. Martin 
ships hand-tooled belts and saddles as far away as Australia. Saddle prices 
start at $350. 
</P>
<P>
Due north of Wolf Point, only 14 miles from the Canadian border, vacationers 
reach Scobey, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the community include a combination golf course and squash club. 
The Pioneer Town and Museum is a recreated frontier town made up of buildings 
and equipment from the Missouri River Country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Antiques 
</P>
<P>
There are board walkways leading to an old one-room schoolhouse and church, a 
general store filled with antiques, a 1915 doctor's office and even an old 
movie theater that now features live stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
Every summer there's a weeklong covered-wagon trip from nearby Richland to 
Scobey, culminating in an annual threshing bee held on the Fourth of July -- 
the biggest event of the year, with pancake breakfasts and barbecues, antique 
car shows and sports events. 
</P>
<P>

Wolf Point is 225 miles northwest of Billings. Northwest Airlines operates two 
flights daily between the cities. The fare is $118 one way, or $171 round trip, 
with a seven-day advance purchase. The best connections from Los Angeles to 
Billings are through Salt Lake City on Delta Airlines, or through Denver on 
United or Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations include the General Sherman Motor Hotel, 200 E. Main St., Wolf 
Point 59201, (406) 653-1100. Rates for a double room are under $35. For

HER WORLD: A PICNIC ADDS TASTE TO VISUAL FEASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't always called the White Tower, that 100-foot-high bulwark at the 
heart of the Tower of London. The name took hold only in 1241, when Henry III 
whitewashed the original stones, which had come from Kent and Caen back in 1077 
at the order of William the Conqueror. 
</P>
<P>
Or so I am told. 
</P>
<P>
What I know for sure is that the tower is a formidable backdrop for a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
I sat there, on a bench by the River Thames, and unwrapped the foil from a 
jacket potato that I'd bought from a cart beside Tower Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor offered dozens of toppings, including chili and onions; I asked for 
grated cheddar cheese and fresh chives. The potato was crisp on the outside, 
flaky on the inside and so hot that the golden cheese melted. 
</P>
<P>
A beefeater guard walked by on his break. The Crown Jewels were locked up 
behind. Pink-cheeked youngsters toddled after pigeons. Nannies toddled after 
youngsters. The moat was wide and green. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mistaking where I was. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing Reality 
</P>
<P>
A picnic, somehow, is like pinching yourself to prove you are there. It slows 
you down just enough to reinforce reality. It adds the sense of taste to visual 
wonders. It places you on the scene, instead of isolating you behind bus 
windows or the perspiring glass of an air-conditioned restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Whether in city or country, a picnic allows the day to flow on, its mood and 
rhythm unbroken by the search for an eatery or a long wait for service. 
</P>
<P>
For me a picnic menu is incidental, though not unimportant. It is the setting 
that glimmers long after the cheese and the bread have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneous picnics are best. They are a sudden gift to yourself and your 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
I have skipped a midday meal -- even a prepaid one -- to stay outside on a 
brisk, sunny Sunday in Stockholm's Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
I have excused myself from a scheduled tour lunch in Budapest to catch a snack 
at the city zoo. 
</P>
<P>
I have pulled my rental car off lonely roads during rain squalls in Scotland 
and picnicked behind locked doors -- while being splendidly frightened by BBC 
mystery tales on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
One summer I left Dubrovnik by van with six friends, driving up the ragged 
Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia. The day was fresh and clear; fist-shaped clouds 
boxed their way across a blue horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Split was our destination, but unanimous was our vote to skip a hotel dining 
room scene at noon. Our time was too short; our diets had been too heavy. We 
paused at a village market -- not far from Hvar -- and pointed to olives, 
cheese, bread, wine and figs. With Swiss Army knives at the ready, we picnicked 
amid white boulders on a cliff high above the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite picnics happened because of a funeral in the Portuguese 
village of Sintra. The procession filled the narrow street with mourners who 
walked behind a canary-yellow Ford Cabriolet that had been made into a hearse 
with tassels and filigree. 
</P>
<P>
We could not move our car from the curb. So we watched for a while and then 
began buying fresh bread, slabs of Serpa and Flamenco cheese and a bottle of 
vinho verde in its tall green bottle. 
</P>
<P>
By then the procession had passed, and we drove into the countryside to a field 
crimson with poppies. We sprawled beneath groaning white windmills and drank a 
toast to life. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, near Obidos, we took the empty bottle into a country store for a 
refill. The proprietor walked past barrels of white wine and rose, then tapped 
the vinho verde. From a drawer of odd corks he cut one to fit and pushed it 
into the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Another magical time was in a glade above the walled village of Riquewihr south 
of Strasbourg. We had been traveling by barge on the canals of Alsace and 
Lorraine; it felt good to commune with the earth. 
</P>
<P>
The young French chef sent us off with hampers of melons, bean salad, quiche 
Lorraine, chocolate tarts and Alsatian wines. But for a gathering of rain 
clouds, we might have stayed until dark. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ingredients of a picnic in France are present in French Polynesia. 
Rather than dine at a hotel on the island of Moorea we stopped at a roadside 
market for fresh baguettes, goat cheese with herbs, taro chips and Tahitian 
Hinano beer. 
</P>
<P>
Then, traveling slowly by motor scooter, we began searching for a perfect 
beach. It was not far away, a shallow cup of white sand that faced the lagoon 
and was shaded by Australian pines. A tree stump would serve as a table. A 
small stone bench would allow us to sit above the sand. 
</P>
<P>
As we left, I looked for a sign so that I could identify this romantic place. A 
small placard was tacked to a tree: "Propriete Prive. Tabu." 
</P>
<P>
I respect private property as much as I love picnics, so I am glad I ate first 
and read later.

HOSPITAL UNIT EASES TURMOIL FOR ELDERLY WITH DEMENTIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derold Biggerstaff was sitting at his desk in his Playa del Rey home when his 
wife, Ardnell, teetered into the room. 
</P>
<P>
She wore a high-heeled pump on one foot, a running shoe on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"My shoes are lopsided," the distressed woman told her husband of 51 years. 
Biggerstaff explained about her mismatched shoes. "What should I do about it?" 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
The Biggerstaffs, who are in their early 70s, are among the millions of elderly 
Americans dealing with the wrenching reality of Alzheimer's disease and other 
disorders that produce cognitive impairment or dementia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped by Program 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's, the Biggerstaffs are being helped by 
an unusual program at Century City Hospital that offers them both comprehensive 
assessment and, if necessary, coordinated treatment of Ardnell Biggerstaff's 
medical, psychological and functional condition, as well as psychological and 
practical support for her husband -- all at one location. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Morishita, the nurse practitioner who heads the hospital's Center for 
Geriatric Health, said the program is designed so that even people who are 
confused can take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making and keeping track of appointments with a host of different 
doctors, social workers and others, an elderly person who wants to be evaluated 
at the hospital only needs to make a single appointment. If necessary, the 
hospital will provide transportation -- usually in a van that can accommodate 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 elderly people with dementia are evaluated each week in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Institute, which is part of the Center for Geriatric 
Health, Morishita said. The cost varies according to the tests and procedures 
done (the center, which also evaluates elderly people who don't suffer 
dementia, accepts Medicare). 
</P>
<P>
While being assessed, dementia patients spend one whole day at what the staff 
calls its geriatric day hospital, a suite of examination, conference and other 
rooms next to the hospital's in-patient geriatric ward. 
</P>
<P>
Although they don't spend the night, they are assigned a regular hospital room 
with a private bath. The main reason for that, Morishita said, is to ensure 
their privacy. "A lot of the things we need to talk to them about are very 
delicate," she said, noting that many patients are embarrassed by their memory 
loss or other symptoms of cognitive impairment. They may also be sensitive 
about such symptoms as the inability to control urination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determined by Team 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, patients are seen by a team of physicians, including a 
psychiatrist, nurses, social workers and others with geriatrics training. 
Patients' condition, their emotional and intellectual state and their need for 
speech therapy or other rehabilitation are determined by the team. Any tests 
needed, except for X-rays, are done in the geriatric day hospital. Patients are 
escorted to X-ray sessions by hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage is that the schedule is flexible -- important when dealing with 
people who may have enormous difficulty expressing themselves, may be irascible 
or may simply tire easily, Morishita said. Instead of starting right off with a 
medical history, "we'll have the social worker go first if the person is 
resistant," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Because the patient is there the entire day, the staff is able to observe how 
well the person functions. Is the patient able to use the bathroom? Is he or 
she angry or withdrawn? Does the patient try to wander away? What kind of 
vocabulary does he or she use? During lunch, is the patient able to feed 
himself or herself? 
</P>
<P>
An evaluation of how well the individual actually functions is as important, in 
its own way, as the diagnosis of any disease that may be present. "What we are 
most concerned about is quality of life," Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert T. Wang, whose specialty is geriatric medicine, said even excellent 
physicians who lack special training may fail to identify the problems of 
elderly patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Diagnoses 
</P>
<P>
"They are very good at treating disease, but they may not be very good at 
seeing the patient as a whole and what the person needs to function more 
efficiently," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
Often, he noted, people who come in for dementia have already been told they 
have Alzheimer's when they actually have some other disorder. Although 
Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting 
between 5% and 10% of all those over 65, Wang said he and his colleagues see at 
least as much stroke-related disease among their confused or otherwise 
intellectually impaired patients. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's can really only be diagnosed by a microscopic analysis of brain 
tissue, usually only done during an autopsy, Wang explained. Although 
Alzheimer's disease is progressive and incurable, some other forms of dementia 
are treatable. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Trader, the program's geriatric psychiatrist, said about half the 
elderly people he sees suffer from depression or some other treatable 
psychiatric disorder. Prescription drugs may also cause dementia-like symptoms, 
especially sleep medications and sedative-hypnotic drugs such as Valium. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is not yet convinced, for instance, that Ardnell Biggerstaff has 
Alzheimer's. Although she shows signs of confusion and memory loss, she 
surprised everyone when she was asked if she had seen anything interesting 
recently on TV. She answered, yes, that she had been disturbed by the murder of 
young actress Rebecca Schaeffer, whose name she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever possible, the staff likes to see the patients' families. Trader said 
the team often asks relatives to corroborate information supplied by the 
patient, who may have lost the ability to describe his or her problems. 
Moreover, families themselves are often in need of psychological support 
dealing with such painful issues as fears that they too will eventually develop 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takes Toll on Families 
</P>
<P>
Dementia takes its toll on the whole family, the team agreed. Besides listening 
to family members' concerns, "we try to help the family adjust their 
expectations," Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
Trader said he has observed adult children of patients with dementia "being 
nicer to their own children," apparently because they realize that some day 
they too may be disabled and dependent. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrie Ellman is the team's gerontologist -- someone, in her own words, "who 
has learned to look at the world through the eyes of the older person." 
</P>
<P>
Ellman, who often develops a relationship with patients and their families, 
helps obtain case workers for patients who need them, helps the families 
develop long-term care plans and assists with such painful decisions as whether 
or not to care for the ill person at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Every situation is different," Ellman said, echoing Tolstoy's observation that 
every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. The gerontologist routinely 
answers families' questions about how to protect patients' assets. She also 
arranges for legal advice from volunteer attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, the evaluation team meets to share their findings and 
make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Isn't Depressed 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the team doesn't find it depressing to work with patients who are 
often not going to get better. Most medicine is like that, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
"Medicine in general doesn't cure," the doctor said. "It manages. It tries to 
prevent further deterioration." Small improvements in the patient's comfort or 
mobility or ability to communicate can be major triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large," Trader added, "we can make changes in people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ardnell Biggerstaff still spends much of her time staring off into 
space, her husband is very glad they found their way to the program. "You feel 
kind of alone in these situations," he said. "I don't feel so alone about it 
any more."

ARRIVAL OF 26-YEAR-OLD FEMALE RABBI REVIVES TROUBLED CONSERVATIVE SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was Friday morning in the day-care classroom at Mishkon Tephilo Synagogue, 
and the teacher welcomed a smiling young woman who came to look in on the 
children's pre-Sabbath snack. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's this?" the teacher asked as the children chewed on their braided challah 
(egg bread) and spilled their grape juice. "Is it the Sabbath queen?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," they squealed. "It's the rabbi!" 
</P>
<P>
They were right. The Sabbath queen would come later, wafting in with the smell 
of chicken soup to symbolize the day of rest in Jewish homes. But this was 
Rabbi Naomi Levy, a 26-year-old Talmudic scholar who reported for work this 
month as the rabbi of their troubled synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
Levy is not the first female rabbi in Los Angeles, but she is the first outside 
the East Coast to lead a congregation of the Conservative movement, the largest 
of the three major branches of American Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
Mishkon Tephilo's previous full-time rabbi, also a bright young scholar, fled 
after three years of rancor, and many of the young people he had attracted 
dropped away. Some of the older generation went elsewhere or passed on. 
</P>
<P>
But the arrival of Naomi Levy has brought new life to Mishkon Tephilo, whose 
name in Hebrew means Tabernacle of Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflecting Changes 
</P>
<P>
The olive green walls have been painted a bright sea-blue to stand out on a 
newly gentrified stretch of Main Street that straddles the line between Santa 
Monica and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
From a high of 240 families in the early and mid-1980s, membership has dropped 
to 160, but synagogue leaders hope that Levy will bring in some of the large 
number of unaffiliated Jews believed to be living in the area. Many of them are 
single, divorced or otherwise different from the traditional families that make 
up a typical suburban synagogue, and Mishkon Tephilo's membership reflects that 
diversity, said Stan Dorn, a director of the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Judaism isn't what it was when they were 13 (the age of bar mitzvah, the rite 
of passage that means the end of organized religion for many youngsters). By 
challenging people with a woman rabbi who's sharp as a tack, maybe we can bring 
them back," Dorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Levy comes well recommended by her teachers at the Jewish Theological Seminary 
in New York, where she was named outstanding rabbinical student and outstanding 
student of Jewish law, and by members of Temple Beth Am in San Antonio, Tex., 
where she commuted once a month last year to lead prayers and study groups 
while she finished her rabbinical studies. The rabbi is also an unpublished 
poet and an expert on modern Israeli poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"She was an extremely intelligent, wonderfully bright student, with a very, 
very keen literary sense, a good interpreter of (Biblical) texts, asking good 
questions of the texts and demanding that they speak to modern issues, which 
makes her a good rabbi," said Burton Visotzky, a professor of Jewish law at the 
seminary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intellect and Depth 
</P>
<P>
"We got a call from (Mishkon Tephilo)," said Paul Mohl, ex-president of the San 
Antonio synagogue. "I told them they should grab her while they could, because 
she has the intellect and the depth to be a scholar and academician if she 
wants to go that route. She has the sensitivity to go the counseling route if 
she wants to do that, and she had the skills to be a first-rate pulpit rabbi." 
</P>
<P>
An honors graduate of Cornell University, Levy attended an academically 
demanding high school that was strictly traditional Orthodox, even though her 
parents belonged to a Conservative synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Conservative and Reform movements, Orthodoxy does not ordain women 
rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Conservative Jewish household that really stressed Jewish education, 
so I always went to Orthodox yeshivas," Levy said, referring to day schools. 
</P>
<P>
She knew from early childhood that she wanted to be a rabbi, but it was hard to 
reconcile that with the role of women in Orthodox Judaism, which she describes 
as "problematical." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I had a place. It wasn't in the kitchen," she said. "What makes 
religion important, from my perspective, is that there's such a rich tradition 
of ritual, and I think it's important to feel a tangible connection to 
tradition and to something beyond yourself, and I never really understood it, 
except for watching men at services, reading the Torah (Bible scroll), or 
wearing a kippah, tallit and tefilin," referring to the skullcap, ritual shawl 
and leather boxes that observant Jews wear during prayers. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was power in it," Levy said. "Not ruling power, but religious 
power. Spiritual power. There's a whole world of ritual, something tactile, 
that you can touch and feel and that is important in creating a spiritual 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
But, although the Reform movement and the much smaller Reconstructionist branch 
ordained their first women rabbis in the early 1970s, the Conservative 
movement's Jewish Theological Seminary did not open its rabbinical program to 
women until 1984, so she had few role models, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't take it seriously," she said, comparing her desire to a young girl's 
dream of becoming a ballerina: "(It was) something you clearly knew you wanted 
to be, but you clearly knew you couldn't be. Maybe as a young child I didn't 
realize that, but I soon realized it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Allowed 
</P>
<P>
When the seminary opened its doors Levy was ready, having studied psychology 
and Hebrew literature at Cornell. She entered the seminary's first class that 
included women. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't any practical obstacles. The school was opened to women and that 
was that," she said. "The hardest thing is that you're fighting, or maybe it's 
not that you're not fighting, but that you're trying to shatter myths about 
what a rabbi can be. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time I can do that just by meeting people," Levy said. "When they 
meet me, their ideas have to change about what a rabbi is, about who a rabbi 
is. That's true about women in most professions but the rabbinate is just 
opening up." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their endorsement by the Conservative movement, the appointment of a 
female rabbi can be a wrenching thing for a congregation, often pitting a 
traditionally minded older generation against a younger group that is eager for 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Gordon Tucker, dean of Levy's rabbinical school, said the seminary has 
graduated 15 women rabbis since 1984, and the numbers are growing. Women now 
make up about 30% of the student body of 130. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sure, Why not?' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reluctant to make general statements on the basis of what is still a small 
database," Tucker said. "Still, individual congregations have shown confidence 
in them and accepted the idea. As more and more women of really high quality 
are out there, more and more congregations are struggling with it and asking, 
'Could it be us?' and saying, 'Sure, why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the small group ordained by the Conservative movement, there are 
another 115 women who are Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, if this didn't raise hell, I don't know what could," Levy said. "But 
the older community here has welcomed me in very nice ways. They invited me to 
be the guest of honor at their annual dinner. I dhink that, whatever factions 
there have been in the synagogue have decided to work together and create 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1914 by summer visitors from the old Jewish neighborhoods of Boyle 
Heights and City Terrace on the Eastside, Mishkon Tephilo has seen its share of 
internecine battles, but it always has been colorful, old-timers agree. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbis in the early years were expected to slaughter chickens because there was 
no kosher butcher. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during Prohibition, someone apparently sold ritual wine to 
Gentiles, causing a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The congregation was "fractious and rowdy," according to Arnold Springer, a 
historian who has studied its archives. But he said its members were always 
concerned with Jewish education. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1940s, the head of the religious school offered youngsters bats and 
baseballs for enrolling their friends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduced Membership 
</P>
<P>
But few of the founders' grown children stayed in the area, which had begun to 
decay. Many of them moved to the San Fernando Valley after World War II and 
left their parents behind to maintain the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
As the oldsters dwindled, a group of young people led by author and film critic 
Michael Medved gained control of the board in the 1970s, introducing 
Orthodox-style innovations like a barrier to separate men and women. His group 
left after failing to agree on a new rabbi, and the old guard took over again. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that heated atmosphere that Dov Gartenberg, then 31, became rabbi in 
1983, offering new styles of prayer and study that brought the membership up to 
240 families, the highest it had been in years. 
</P>
<P>
Gartenberg, now rabbi of a synagogue in Seattle, remembers his time at Mishkon 
Tephilo as "a very, very difficult struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Older members who had been burned by the Medved experience were happy to see 
the new people come to services, he said, but some of them were edgy about 
Gartenberg's new ideas "and became kind of a rejectionist front." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generational Frictions 
</P>
<P>
"They were comfortable with having a rabbi give a sermon and then you go home, 
so this new style was more participatory," said Paul Nissenbaum, a former vice 
president of the temple who has since left the congregation. He said the 
debates were not "Let's talk and make a decision. It was, 'Who are you to talk 
about it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gartenberg said that Levy should find Mishkon Tephilo a happier place "because 
the young guard has pretty much gained control of the synagogue." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Wax doesn't say how old she is, but she makes no bones about belonging 
to the old guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a senior citizen, let's put it that way," Wax said. 
</P>
<P>
During Gartenberg's years, the senior members welcomed the newcomers, she said, 
but many of them thought the younger group should have kept a low profile, as 
her generation had done when she joined the synagogue 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, "They wanted to make a young synagogue, and the older people didn't 
have a place there. And a lot of older people felt displaced from their 
religious home," Wax said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopeful Future 
</P>
<P>
Although she said her daughter feels out of place at Mishkon Tephilo today, Wax 
feels that it may come alive again. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a Jewish population there, maybe this rabbi can reach out to them," 
she said. "I feel, to me, that it's more important to keep the synagogue going, 
and I hope this rabbi will be able to entice these people to join the 
synagogue, because I wouldn't want to see anything happen to our religious 
home. And if these young people can work something and keep it going, then more 
power to them." 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Vanatek, a member for 55 years, is also reserving judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it did shock me," she said of the decision to hire Levy. "A woman rabbi 
is a very new thing. Some people take to it, and some people don't. We still 
like tradition. She seems very nice, and we'll have to see how she works out." 
</P>
<P>
But Rose Fragin, 80, daughter of a founding member of the synagogue, has made 
up her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't an age gap, it's just that the old people are dying," she said. "What 
can we do? So we're getting the young people in, and they have ideas." 
</P>
<P>
As for Levy, Fragin said, "She knows exactly what she wants to say, and she 
doesn't hem and haw. And she has a nice smile. I like her."

ACTIVIST CALLS W. HOLLYWOOD EFFORT TO RECRUIT GAY DEPUTIES A FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A much-publicized effort by the city of West Hollywood to help recruit gays as 
deputies for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was a failure, the 
head of a gay rights group says. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Soliz-Marich, interim director of Advocates for Better Law Enforcement, a 
watchdog group set up in May to monitor the gay recruitment process, said that 
only about half a dozen acknowledged gays expressed serious interest and that 
"insofar as we've been able to determine, not a single openly gay person has 
become involved in the hiring process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lack of Interest' 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, it was a failure," Soliz-Marich said, blaming the Sheriff's 
Department for what he termed "a lack of interest in recruiting gays" and city 
officials for "a poorly coordinated, even if well-intentioned, effort." 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Abbe Land took exception to the group's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call it a failure," she said. "We put the word out and did 
everything we could to make sure gays and lesbians got a fair shot, and I hope 
we laid a foundation for future recruitments." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department conducted its first-ever general recruitment and 
testing in the West Hollywood area in June, after refusing requests from West 
Hollywood officials to seek gays in a manner similar to the way it recruits 
racial and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
35% of Residents Gay 
</P>
<P>
As part of a compromise, the Sheriff's Department authorized West Hollywood 
officials to coordinate what amounted to a shadow recruitment effort aimed 
largely at the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department provides police services to West Hollywood, where an 
estimated 35% of the 37,000 residents are gay, under an $8.6-million contract 
that expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials have praised the Sheriff's Department's crime-fighting 
abilities, gays have frequently complained to the City Council about being 
harassed by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights activists, who were critical of the compromise arrangement, said 
last week that they were not surprised that the drive appeared to have missed 
the mark. 
</P>
<P>
"City officials made a big error in assuming that just because they wanted gay 
and lesbian recruits, they would get them," said Sandy Dwyer, publisher of the 
News, a gay newspaper. "You won't get gay applicants until the Sheriff's 
Department makes it clear it wants them, and it hasn't exhibited a willingness 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
However, other activists were more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever can be said about its success or failure, the recruitment had the 
effect of putting gays and lesbians in the public eye," said Kim Kralj, an art 
gallery owner. "If nothing else, I'm hopeful that it has made the Sheriff's 
Department sit up and take notice." 
</P>
<P>
Of 223 applicants who took a written exam at Fairfax High School in June, 106 
passed, sheriff's officials said. Of those, 76 passed interviews and background 
checks to qualify for the department's 17-week training academy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Not Asked 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Bill Baker, who oversees several sheriff's stations, including the one in 
West Hollywood, said the department has no way of knowing the sexual 
orientation of the applicants "because we don't ask." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department says it does not discriminate against gays or any 
other group; officials have also frequently pointed out that sexual orientation 
is a "non-merit issue" outside the protection of affirmative action laws. 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights activists, however, claim that the department takes a dim view of 
hiring gays and that gay deputies are afraid to be open about their sexual 
orientation. Gay activists say there are no acknowledged gays among the 
department's more than 7,000 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Some activists who wanted the city to take a stronger stand in favor of gay 
recruitment assailed the dual recruitment arrangement, saying it sent a message 
that the Sheriff's Department views gays as second-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right to OK Ads 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Sheriff's Department reserved the right to approve 
recruitment ads and in which publications they would be placed. The department 
refused to allow the ads to be run in the gay press, citing a policy against 
advertising in publications that contain sexually explicit material. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials defied the department and placed an ad in the program guide 
of the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade, sponsored by Christopher Street 
West. 
</P>
<P>
At the private urging of city officials, the department agreed to place 
recruitment ads in the News but, Dwyer said, abruptly canceled the ads the day 
after two City Council members held a news conference calling for the creation 
of a Public Safety Commission to hear complaints from gays and others who claim 
abuses by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Held Seminar 
</P>
<P>
When more than 60 prospective applicants showed up for a Sheriff's 
Department-sponsored seminar at the Pacific Design Center, the city held its 
own seminar for gay recruits across the street at the West Hollywood Park 
Auditorium. It was conducted by a gay San Francisco County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The event attracted only five prospective applicants, who were far outnumbered 
by members of the press, city officials and curious gay activists. 
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Land pledged to help any applicants who encountered problems 
with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody took me up on my offer, and we haven't heard anything as to who, if 
anyone, from that group went through with the process," the mayor said last 
week. In separate interviews in June, the five prospective gay applicants 
doubted whether they would be accepted by the Sheriff's Department and said 
that, if they applied, they did not intend to reveal their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Soliz-Marich said that of the half a dozen gays his group monitored, only one 
is thought to be still interested in applying, "and that individual did not 
participate in the testing in June. He said he might later, at some other 
location." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's safe to say that all of the acknowledged gays fell through the 
cracks."

PROJECT IN WALNUT HITS OPPOSITION; 
</P>
<P>
HOMEOWNERS COOL TO DEVELOPER'S PLAN

WALNUT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a city that draws affluent families to its bucolic suburban life style, 
prestigious schools and safe neighborhoods. Half-million-dollar homes are not 
uncommon and residents take neighborly pride in their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of residents have given the developer who wants to build 695 
luxury homes, a hotel, and recreational facilities on the last undeveloped site 
in the city a decidedly unfriendly welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Newport Beach-based The William Lyon Co., has scaled down the 
project several times since the city first rejected the original proposal to 
build 1,200 homes on a hilly 551.5-acre site just south of West Covina and east 
of the BKK Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drain Resources 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reduction in size, dozens of residents and several homeowner 
associations still bristle at the thought of pristine hillsides being graded 
and leveled to make way for extravagant homes, a 125- to 200-room hotel, an 
equestrian trail, a nine-hole golf course and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the development would pose landslide and earthquake hazards. Some 
of them are worried about the proximity of the site to the landfill, and fear 
that the development's wells could be contaminated one day by chemicals from 
the dump that have seeped into the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants for the Lyon Co., one of the largest home builders in the state, 
are expected to release an environmental impact report for the project next 
month. At an Aug. 1 meeting called to collect comments for inclusion in the 
report, more than 50 people showed up in protest. The project's more vocal 
opponents have vowed they will continue the fight to kill the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Will Resist' 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many damn people here already," Maurice Cofer, president of the 
Gartel Fuente Homeowners Assn., said last week. The association, which includes 
homeowners in the area bounded by La Puente Road, Amar Road and Lemon Avenue, 
claims approximately 400 members. "We will resist it any way we can. We are 
opposed to the raping of the hills simply for profits." 
</P>
<P>
Cofer said the five Walnut homeowners associations have a plan of action to 
ensure that the City Council will reject the developer's latest plan, but would 
not disclose details. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns residents and city officials most is that the project calls for 
twice as many homes as are allowed under the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The area is zoned for .6 units per acre because of deep ravines that make 
access to the hilly slopes difficult, said Planning Director George Shindo. The 
developer wants to build 1.28 units per acre. Those homes would be concentrated 
on 60% of the site. In order for the project to be approved, the City Council 
must amend the plan to allow for the increased density. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story of people saying, 'I'm here, I'm looking at these 
beautiful hills and I want to keep looking at the beautiful hills,' " said 
Shindo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cutting Up Hills 
</P>
<P>
"They've been cutting up hills all over the city," said Kyen Jenkins, president 
of Snowcreek Homeowners Assn. "What is the rush to develop it all now? Walnut 
has gone through a major growth in last several years." 
</P>
<P>
But the Lyon Co.'s manager for the project, Bryan Austin, said the zoning rules 
were based on misconceptions about the area's topography. The hills could 
actually support a higher density of homes if a significant amount of grading 
were done. That would cost from $35 to $40 million, Austin said. He pointed out 
that the area across the street from the site, west of Lemon Avenue, is zoned 
for 2.5 units per acre, and 1.0 unit per acre is allowed on land east of Lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said that instead of fighting the project, the city should welcome more 
residents, because the $700,000 homes would provide a wider property-tax base. 
And the hotel and shopping center would provide the city with more sales-tax 
revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Producer 
</P>
<P>
"The city has been looking for revenue-generating uses to support current 
budget levels," he said. "That's the primary reason the hotel was considered." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ray Watson said that more commercial development, especially large 
department stores, would be desirable. Watson said he is "keeping an open mind" 
about the proposal until the impact report is issued. But, he added: "(I) can't 
see where adding more homes is going to be any long-term benefit to the city 
because it'll cost us more in services. If it doesn't benefit the city, I'm not 
going to vote in favor of it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was concerned about the environmental impact of developing the hills 
so close to a dump site, despite a 2,000-foot-wide "buffer zone" around the BKK 
Landfill which cannot be built on. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fault areas and slide areas," he said. "I don't want to see people 
spend money for homes and then have a major earthquake wipe out everything they 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the proposal's detractors are only a few loud voices, and that the 
Lyon Co. had sent out more than 600 notices in the area, but "only 60 people 
were in attendance." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Linda Holmes disagreed, saying objections to the proposed 
development are coming not only from the immediate area but from throughout the 
city and from residents in West Covina, which is adjacent to the site on the 
north side. 
</P>
<P>
"(Opposition) wasn't just in the area," Holmes said. "It's throughout the city, 
the Creekside houses, Hunters Hill, Marlborough all throughout the city they're 
complaining."

W. HOLLYWOOD'S RENT CONTROL LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Again, I write to protest the unfair treatment of landlords (I hate that word) 
by West Hollywood's onerous rent control law. (The Times, July 13.) Just 
because a few other cities have similar legislation does not make our law any 
more fair, equitable or reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
We were absent for a few weeks on a necessary trip to the Midwest, only to 
return to find that the screws had again been tightened. Fees have been doubled 
with the owner alone paying for the increase. How can the powers-that-be 
maintain that these costs are not a business expense, but must be subtracted 
from the owner's "exorbitant profits"? 
</P>
<P>
Hard on the heels of this injustice comes a list of new fees. Among them are 
new fees for rent change applications: $25 for tenants but $250 and up for 
landlords with the landlord required to reimburse all tenants if the tenant 
succeeds. No remuneration, or course, to landlords for "fishing expeditions" by 
tenants. Our city fathers and their burgeoning progeny are now killing two 
birds with one stone; catering to the tenant majority by socking it to the 
landlords and brazenly raising fees to help balance an engorged city budget. 
</P>
<P>
These fees as well as the loss of normal market rents are most certainly a 
"taking" of property rights as banned by the Bill of Rights, but these rights 
seem to have been set aside by our local government in order to protect and 
curry favor of the tenant majority. Granted, some low income and/or senior 
citizen tenants need help to provide them with a decent place to live at rents 
they can afford, but to expect landlords to carry this burden alone instead of 
the city and the electorate as a whole is ridiculous and totally unfair. This 
path leads inevitably down the path to socialism and communism. 
</P>
<P>
Also unfair is the penalizing of existing apartment projects by excluding 
projects from rent control which are built after 1984. This is patently being 
done so as not to discourage new housing, which the city wants. This exclusion 
will not work as developers and lenders know that this favoritism could easily 
end abruptly at the whim of our irresponsible city government.

HOMEOWNERS WANT TO JILT POMONA, JOIN CHINO HILLS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-one homeowners living in the southeast part of the city hope the City 
Council will decide by the end of the month on a proposal to separate the 
neighborhood from Pomona and let it become part of the San Bernardino County 
community of Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between the Pomona Freeway and the Corona Expressway just above the 
San Bernardino County line, the homeowners are in an awkward situation. They 
are within Pomona city limits, but the houses -- which run along Scenic Ridge 
Drive and Rock Crest Lane east of the Corona Expressway -- are geographically 
part of Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Residents send their children to schools in the Chino Hills School District, 
receive mail through post offices in Chino Hills and use San Bernardino County 
roads and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bryant Favors Move 
</P>
<P>
"Our address is in Chino Hills. If someone uses the Pomona address, it takes 
weeks to get to us," said Frank Mackey, president of the Rolling Ridge 
Homeowners Assn., which organized three years ago to address problems the 41 
homeowners faced. Shortly after its formation, the group voted unanimously to 
recommend the move, and wrote letters to county supervisors and Pomona 
officials asking for their support. 
</P>
<P>
The boundary change must be approved by both counties and the City Council. Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, whose district includes Pomona, is in 
favor of the move, and the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors has 
already adopted a resolution of intent accepting the 41 homes into its 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is expected to come before the City Council this month. Councilman C. 
L. (Clay) Bryant, who is favor of the move, said Wednesday that he plans to put 
the matter on the Aug. 21 council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much in sympathy with those people," Bryant said. "They really do 
belong to the Chino community there. This is America, and they deserve better." 
</P>
<P>
Other council members, however, had mixed reactions to the possible loss of 
that part of the city because it would mean a loss in property- and utility-tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be some demonstrated benefit to the city," Councilman Mark A. T. 
Nymeyer said. "Those are fairly significant homes. I don't see how they can 
objectively request this without any remuneration." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith said she understood the concerns of the homeowners but would 
try to negotiate with San Bernardino County to share property-tax revenue for a 
period after the move takes effect. But even if such an agreement could not be 
worked out, she would most likely support it anyway, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Request 
</P>
<P>
Requests to separate from one city and become part of another county are 
unusual, according to Michi Takahashi, executive assistant for the Los Angeles 
County Local Agency Formation Commission, which processes applications for 
boundary changes. The Pomona group's application is the only one of its kind 
the commission has received in the last two years, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey said his reasons for wanting to become part of Chino Hills are more than 
just a desire for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a future say in those hills because they're developing very 
quickly," he said. "It's one of the fastest growing areas in Southern 
California. The natural boundary line is the Pomona Freeway, because they can't 
build any more homes north of us. If we have traffic problems, we want to have 
a say."

BALDWIN PARK POLICE SEEK PUBLIC SUPPORT OVER PACT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Baldwin Park Police Assn. will ask for community support in its effort to 
reach a contract agreement with the city, the association's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city proposed a 7.5% raise in the first year of a two-year contract, but 
only if we give up overtime benefits, which every other department has," said 
attorney Stephen Silver. "That's the major obstacle to reaching an agreement." 
The city has offered a 5% raise the second year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Leo King and Acting City Manager Michael Yelton could not be reached last 
week for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 70-member union, which includes sergeants and officers, 
dispatchers and records clerks, have been working without a contract since June 
30, when their two-year contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said the union proposed that the two sides use mediators or arbitrators 
but that was rejected by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although union members would like community support, Silver didn't rule out a 
strike. "That's a possibility," he said. "We have no plans to do it at this 
time. We hope it doesn't come to that."

ASSESSOR TO SPEAK ON TAX INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statewide initiative on next June's ballot that would increase taxes on 
commercial properties will be discussed Monday by Los Angeles County Assessor 
John Lynch at the monthly meeting of the Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon will be at 11:30 a.m. in the Starlight Room of the Miramar 
Sheraton hotel, 101 Wilshire Blvd. Cost is $15. 
</P>
<P>
The "Fair Share Property Tax Act of 1990" is advocated by Voters' Revolt, the 
same organization that sponsored Proposition 103, the auto insurance initiative 
approved by voters this year. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would raise the tax rate for commercial properties from a 
maximum of 1% of property values to 2.2%, and allow for the assessed value of 
the property to increase each year based on the inflation rate to a maximum of 
5% a year.

ANGLO-AMERICAN DISCH; 
</P>
<P>
YES, LET'S NEW AND SELECTED POEMS BY TOM DISCH (THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 
PRESS: $16.95, CLOTH; $8.95, PAPER; 112 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ian Gregson, Gregson will be a visiting professor in the English department 
at Cal State Long Beach in the fall semester. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cluster of qualities that first strike the reader of Tom Disch's poems -- 
robust skepticism and realism, urbane wit, rueful irony, formal elegance -- has 
not characterized much post-war U.S. poetry. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast these qualities have been repeatedly found together in post-war 
British poetry. Ever since the Movement -- Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis, Donald 
Davie (see Page 6), Thomas Gunn -- took control in the early '50s, British 
expectations about poetry have been molded by these characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
This is not simply a poetic but an attitude to life. As such it does seem 
peculiarly British and is linked to an empiricist attitude, a belief in common 
sense, common decency, a mistrust of systematic thinking, extremism, of 
emotional intensity. So poets who have stepped out of line have often been 
accused, by implication, of being un-British -- this is partly what Larkin 
meant when, asked about Ted Hughes' "Crow," he replied: "Personally, I prefer 
Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
So it's surprising to find Disch, an American poet, writing in a Movement way 
-- though not so surprising that, as a result, he has been more warmly received 
in Britain than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of writing has a number of strengths. It's rarely pretentious, or 
obscure, or formless -- all weaknesses to which American poetry is prone. It's 
usually intelligent and readable, and it's often funny. It has many of the 
strengths of the realist novel; it's especially good at narrative, at 
describing character and at reflecting on society -- Hardy is an important 
ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Rapist's Villanelle" Disch summons up an upper-middle class, 
cosmopolitan social milieu simply by noting the victim's "hand-knitted sweater 
from the Isle/ Of Skye, (her) apres-ski of bold chartreuse." 
</P>
<P>
The rapist's state of mind emerges through the way the villanelle form frames 
his words. The lines, "She spent her money with such perfect style" and "I 
couldn't help myself; I had to smile" both appear four times. This repetition 
suggests how, to the rapist, the victim's compulsive shopping and his obsessive 
desire are linked -- become somehow equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
That the rapist makes this association reveals his cool depravity. This and the 
poem's formal elegance hint at violence lurking below the chic surface -- what 
Harold Pinter has called "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
This is a memorable poem. However, there are narrownesses connected with the 
Movement poetic, most of which arise from the voice adopted by these poets -- 
the hard-headed, no-nonsense way they talk to the reader. They keep telling us 
how tough they are, how unsentimental, that they're relatively without 
illusions, that they don't suffer fools gladly but that they don't have too 
high an opinion of themselves. It's perhaps not a coincidence that most of the 
Movement poets were at Oxford at the same time as Mrs. Thatcher, in a postwar 
period of formative exhaustion and bleakness. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there are a number of cliches associated with poetry influenced 
by the Movement. 
</P>
<P>
And Disch, despite his different background, is not immune to them. In this 
book, too, there are rueful references to aging, to how bald and/or fat the 
poet is getting; to the terrible historical violence, etc., that you can learn 
about in art galleries; to the habits other people have that bore you -- for 
instance, of showing you their holiday slides; to other things that seem boring 
(e.g. people who "work on a tan") but that -- hang on a minute -- are actually 
interesting (for the sun has an immemorially beneficent influence). 
</P>
<P>
It's fortunate, then, that Disch has chosen to add something different to his 
basically British style. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this may simply be a matter of his different temperament -- for example 
he isn't dour like his British models. Life is not for him, as for Larkin, 
"first boredom, then fear." "Yes, Let's" is eponymously positive and charged 
throughout with exuberance, and his "High Purpose in Poetry: A Primer" 
prescribes acceptance of life as the proper attitude in poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, however, he adds American influences to his British ones, so 
that he is most accurately seen as a hybrid, introducing British influence into 
U.S. poetry, as Thom Gunn, among others, has introduced American influence into 
British poetry. 
</P>
<P>
At a formal level, this allows Disch to use free-verse techniques to keep a 
poem's loose ends untied in order to suggest an existential asymmetry, the 
jagged edges of experience, avoiding the monolithic four-squareness of stricter 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
More broadly, it means that realism often encounters modernism in Disch's work. 
This produces some of his most effective poems. And it does seem the case that 
some of the most successful contemporary poems (American and British) occur 
when this encounter takes place -- realist poets struggling with modernism, 
modernist poets impelled to introduce an air of "reality." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Prisoners of War" the modernist anxiety about language and its 
problematic relationship with experience is employed to enforce a political 
meaning, to show that when a country is annexed and its language suppressed, 
the people of that country live, in a sense, under a curse. For they are 
condemned to find even familiar things inexplicable, because unnameable: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
what can they do now 
</P>
<P>
but point? At parts of bodies, at what 
</P>
<P>
they want to eat, at instrument 
</P>
<P>
 panels, at 
</P>
<P>
new highways and other areas of 
</P>
<P>
intense 
</P>
<P>
 reconstruction 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For these people, political oppression has an analogous effect -- though in a 
frightening, political way -- to that radical defamiliarizing practiced by 
modernist literature: They are disoriented by the shock of the new. 
</P>
<P>
"Coal Miners" also employs a defamiliarizing strategy, here so extreme it 
becomes surreal. It's a dramatic monologue (this is one of Disch's favorite 
forms) spoken by a white-collar worker whose sentimental socialist outlook 
leads him to idealize the miners; this exposes the gulf between the classes in 
their ways of life and thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Because the speaker's fantasizing is allowed full rein, the life he evokes is 
bizarre, even otherworldly -- perhaps here Disch's activities as a science 
fiction writer are relevant. Miners, through this monologuist's eyes, become 
heroes -- awesomely in touch with elemental and even mythic forces: 
</P>
<P>
These small homages to the icons 
</P>
<P>
of his tragic 
</P>
<P>
 vigour 
</P>
<P>
Only allow us less guiltily to 
</P>
<P>
hypothesize his life 
</P>
<P>
 Underground: how he attacks the 
</P>
<P>
spangled earth, 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing slowly down its major 
</P>
<P>
arteries impelled 
</P>
<P>
 By an anger his own unholy 
</P>
<P>
din every moment renews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incomprehension between the classes is further emphasized when the speaker 
tries to imagine how the miners imagine his white-collar life -- this is 
"reality" twice removed. His imagination caricatures his own life by 
caricaturing a miner's thinking as obsessively subterranean: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If they could hear us maundering 
</P>
<P>
 In the fictive caverns of our 
</P>
<P>
 mirrored bars, 
</P>
<P>
 They'd only damn our 
</P>
<P>
 condescending eyes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Condescending" is very precise -- it measures the distance between the miners' 
physical descent and the failed act of empathizing with it. 
</P>
<P>
Poems like this, then, show how apparently incompatible influences have been 
combined by Disch to produce telling and subtle effects. At his best he writes 
a social poetry that is at least as entertaining as his British influences, and 
as sophisticated as his American ones.

A CONVERSATION WITH SOLZHENITSYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Printed below are two excerpts from a long (30-page) conversation, originally 
published in 1987 in the German magazine Der Spiegel. Solzhenitsyn's 
conversation partner on that occasion was Rudolf Augstein, the founder of that 
magazine and Solzhenitsyn's chronological peer. (The two were stationed near 
each other on the Eastern Front during World War II.) 
</P>
<P>
 The first excerpt is a discussion of Peter Stolypin, Russian prime minister 
from 1905 to 1911. If communism has been a 70-year blind alley in Russian 
history, to what point in the pre-communist past should contemporary Russia 
return for a new beginning? Solzhenitsyn proposes the Stolypin era. The second 
excerpt is a discussion of the overall structure of "The Red Wheel," the novel 
cycle of which "August 1914" is the first part. 
</P>
<P>
STOLYPIN LIVES 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: After the Revolution of 1905 there was an attempt at reform from the 
top down, headed by Premier Stolypin, whose picture is hanging here above your 
writing desk. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: He led an energetic group of technical experts and statesmen; he 
was the one who wanted to get rid of this system of the corporate 
responsibility of the mir (agricultural commune). Stolypin was trying to get an 
agricultural system in the Western sense, with independent peasants. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: He lost the tsar's favor. When he was murdered in 1911, he was 
already a dead man, politically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: That's not quite true. He carried out his reform. The Duma, on 
the other hand, our Parliament, tried for three long years to throttle the 
reform. Who was the liberal here, and who was the reactionary? Stolypin was the 
liberal! Still, you're quite right, the extreme right hated him. The extreme 
left too. Nevertheless, he carried out his reform. His idea was to liberate the 
peasants from economic dependency, then they would become citizens. First, 
you'd have to make the citizen, then civic consciousness would be born too. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: There was no middle class in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: That's why up to a certain point Stolypin actually did introduce 
this new system of individual farmsteads after the western model. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: Who opposed these reforms, who rescinded them? 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: After the February Revolution of 1917 the Provisional Government 
rescinded Stolypin's reform. After October, the Bolsheviks forbade individual 
farms and finally destroyed them. On this point I want to make it clear why I 
call so much attention to Stolypin, not only in our conversation but also in my 
book. He was a real liberal, who tried to set the economy free and to lead 
people to civic consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: Could Stolypin have prevented the October Revolution? Your book 
"November 1916" (Editor's note: The second part of "The Red Wheel"; not yet 
published in English translation) describes Russia as already ripe for the 
upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: By no means! Let's go to the next question, which is already 
closer to "November 1916." Thanks to the kindness of my German publisher, 
Piper, I was able to read 40 reviews of my work, "November 1916." The critical 
discussions of "August 1914" from 1972 I couldn't read because Soviet 
censorship had pocketed them. Now by reading reviews I've learned a lot. I've 
seen what today's Germany knows about Russia back then, and also what it knows, 
and doesn't know, about Russia today. In the reviews, for example, there's a 
relatively widespread belief that in "November 1916" Solzhenitsyn describes 
Russia as ripe for the October Revolution. What I describe is, as a matter of 
fact, the enormous inner tension that prevailed in this state. The tension 
between the classes, the complete mutual incomprehension, led to the 
situation's becoming labile. People didn't know where they were headed. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: And for Russia the war was lost. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: No, at that time not yet. First, Russia had allies; second, at 
the beginning of 1917 the troops' logistics were very good. The artillery, for 
example, had on the whole everything it needed. Russia's weakness consisted in 
the conflict among the social classes, and this tension actually had created an 
instability. Revolution was not unavoidable, only possible. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: But you do have to admit that the autocrats in Russia, in Germany, 
and in Austria-Hungary were not equal to the problems, which the democracies 
solved more easily. The tsar couldn't govern. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: I'd prefer not to talk about the internal situation in 
Austria-Hungary. What I can say is this, that the new state apparatus that took 
over from the tsarist apparatus was considerably worse than what it replaced. 
To claim that the tsar couldn't govern wouldn't be right. It was just that the 
tsar couldn't find any common language with the educated classes, and they in 
turn couldn't talk to the people. But I don't want to lose the thread of our 
discussion. The Revolution might have broken out, or it might not have. But as 
for the October Revolution, it's rubbish to say that it was already 
foreordained as early as 1916 in the pre-revolutionary phase. No, nothing paved 
the way to it. Lenin himself, in a speech to a public gathering in Switzerland, 
said: "Our generation will not experience the Revolution," noting that he had 
decided to emigrate to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
ABOUT 'THE RED WHEEL' 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: Alexander Isayevich, you owe your world reputation to works that you 
composed in Russia under unbelievable conditions. You would, for example, 
continually learn whole passages by heart, because anything you wrote would be 
taken away from you. And now that you're free to create and write, you've 
undertaken one of the most monumental works known to world history. Two volumes 
have been done, the third is under way. Evidently, you wish to work up history 
from 1914 to the completion of Lenin's dictatorship in 1918 in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: I've found possibilities for working here in the West that I 
couldn't have dreamed of in the Soviet Union. There, even the best Soviet 
sources were inaccessible to me. I wasn't allowed to live in Moscow, I was 
barred from the great libraries, not to mention all the sources that have come 
out in the West. In addition, here in the West I've managed to question 
personally 300 men and women who were participants in the Revolution. In the 
Soviet Union, I had no right to search out eyewitnesses from the period, to ask 
them questions. And scarcely anyone would have answered, out of fear. . . . 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: How can anyone work under such circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: Everyone who gets published in the Soviet Union has to do it, 
although in the meantime the guidelines have been broadened a bit. But I can 
relieve or gratify the German reader by saying that I won't have to write such 
a gigantic number of "knots" as I thought I had to. For the following reasons: 
</P>
<P>
I have to remember that in our time people read less and I have to show some 
consideration for my reader's patience. Furthermore, my age no longer permits 
me to keep tackling new tasks. And most important; I'm coming to the end of the 
fourth knot. 
</P>
<P>
The book ends, according to the old Russian calendar, on May 5, 1917. There I 
see the picture is already lying before me that I was just now describing: 
Russia ready to be snatched by the Bolsheviks. In a certain sense I've 
completed my task. Of course I would have liked, it would have been very 
interesting, to go on working: There was the October Revolution and the events 
of 1918. But it will never get to that point. "August 1914" consists of two 
volumes, so does "November 1916"; in Germany and France each has been published 
as a single volume. With two volumes of "March 1917" and one of "April 1917" 
the German reader is faced with another three volumes to test his patience. 
</P>
<P>
AUGSTEIN: You're bursting with creative energy, but you have some expectations 
of your readers too. They have to work along with you and sometimes have to 
fight off discouragement. 
</P>
<P>
SOLZHENITSYN: Naturally, I always have the Russian reader in mind. For the 
Western reader I'd have to find the time to write somewhat abbreviated 
versions. I didn't have the time before, and I don't have it now. That's why I 
composed the synopsis-chapters. Readers can skip these too. The West doesn't 
need the Russian details, but the overall picture is very instructive for the 
West also.

STILL LIFE WITH INSECTS BY BRIAN KITELEY (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS/ HOUGHTON 
MIFFLIN: $15.95; 140 PP.; 0-89919-898-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Packard, Packard is the editor of the New York Quarterly. His most 
recent book is Evangelism in America: From Tents to TV (Paragon House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This first novel by Brian Kiteley presents us with a disconcerting metaphor: 
Insects live by instinct and tropic responses, whereas modern man is 
increasingly deracinated and cut off in his thinking and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Elwyn Farmer is an amateur entomologist who is recovering from a nervous 
breakdown and keeps a meticulous journal that is ostensibly concerned with 
insect sightings, but inevitably the journal spills over into anecdotal 
material relating to Elwyn's family and peers. The result is a casual glimpse 
into how truly Cubist and dissociated the contemporary psyche has become, cut 
off as it is from its primal planetary rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Farmer confronts the central metaphor of the book directly: 
</P>
<P>
"A certain male moth smells nothing but the pheromone of his mate, but he can 
detect that pheromone five miles away. In a dozen square miles of wheat, the 
pests are unable to stop eating. They reproduce insanely to meet the demand. I 
suggested mixing up the breeds of wheat or growing legumes -- using the old 
rules of crop rotation -- to keep the threat of pests down. One fellow in field 
research laughed. 'You're actually trying to outwit insects? Just spray them 
dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
But most of the time Farmer keeps his own low-key observations to himself: 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a good father or husband. I had no ambition other than to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Kiteley achieves his best effects through simple juxtaposition, as in 
these two passages that are separated by only a few sentences: 
</P>
<P>
"Whit Wheaton hanged himself the day I took him collecting. Three days later my 
sister Ruth broke up several dozen barbiturate pills into a harmless mixture of 
milk and coffee-flavored liqueur and died in her stupefied sleep." 
</P>
<P>
"Larvae, which feed on dead rodents. The adults tunnel underneath the carcass, 
or drag it to loose dirt, and bury it -- hence the name, Burying Beetle." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the novel there is an eerie sense of remorseless cruelty and banal 
absurdity: 
</P>
<P>
"I was about fifty yards away, watching the kangaroo mouse through binoculars. 
He hopped a few yards, then stopped, stiff with fear. A moment passed and so 
did his fear. He began to clean himself, washing off the embarrassment of a 
false alarm. Then he stood on hind legs to yawn, one paw raised, the other 
curled against his chest. For this instant he looked like a little boy I know 
after he's caught in mischief. The next instant I saw the blur of a shadow and 
the talons of a hawk slicing cleanly through the head of the mouse, one claw 
popping out his eye." 
</P>
<P>
This banal remorselessness is matched on the human level by a movie mogul who 
has fallen in love with a rodent caricature: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a story about Jack Warner. He was doddering around his big office. 
Every year he signed an enormous check of money over to us. But one year he 
said to his treasurer, just as he was about to sign, 'I love that Mickey Mouse. 
Tell them to do more shorts with him.' The treasurer said, 'I don't believe 
Mickey Mouse is with us.' The budget got slashed." 
</P>
<P>
The novel ends in a plaintive voice: 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Professor." He laughed. "Help us evolve back into human beings." 
</P>
<P>
In this elliptical persona of Elwyn Farmer, Brian Kiteley has created a 
contemporary echo of Gregor Samsa in Kafka's epochal short story, 
"Metamorphosis." But whereas Gregor has relapsed back to the insect realm, 
Farmer remains curiously immunized from the insects that so fascinate him, all 
the while he becomes more and more unconnected from the human realm that is 
still his habitat. Farmer is a lone voice that seems hauntingly prophetic, if 
we could only figure out what it is he is trying to tell us.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: POLITICAL PARTIES AND ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES BY 
JOSE MARTI EDITED BY PHILIP S. FONER TRANSLATED BY ELINOR RANDALL (TEMPLE 
UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95; 149 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONJA BOLLE

<TEXT>
<P>
This book contains 10 florid, indignant essays of Jose Marti (1853-95), the 
famous Cuban patriot who was exiled and lived in the United States. Here he 
observed the political scene, publishing his essays in various Latin American 
newspapers. The most widely read journalist writing in Spanish at the time, 
Marti came to the United States with a bright view of the land of freedom, but 
rapidly lost his idealism. 
</P>
<P>
Marti is nowhere near as analytical as Tocqueville; in fact, he is much closer 
in spirit to Dickens in "American Notes." Marti comments on the political scene 
in an impressionistic way, as an aristocrat who does not hesitate to criticize 
roundly the rampant political corruption he sees. From 1860-1884, the 
Republicans held the White House, prompting Marti to note that the nation had 
become "a banquet where the fat, successful Republicans were permanently seated 
at the table." Observing the presidential conventions of 1884, he writes: 
"Pails of mud are dumped upon the heads. Lies and exaggerations are knowingly 
spread." And in musing on the history of the United States, he notes that in 
1620, the year the Mayflower set the Pilgrims ashore, a Dutch ship arrived in 
Virginia with 20 slaves on board. "Never has a more extraordinary parallelism 
been seen," he comments. 
</P>
<P>
The most entertaining essay in the book is the last one, which discusses the 
changing of the guard from Cleveland, of whom Marti approved, to Harrison, whom 
Marti despised. He describes the sodden pomp of President Harrison's 
inauguration -- it was raining furiously -- under a sea of umbrellas. Marti 
notes that when Harrison kisses the Bible, he does so "with the timid kiss of a 
fervent Protestant." Then there comes "round after round of applause, like 
gunshot from the people outside who are unable to lose their cheerfulness." 
Harrison "is drinking something brought to him in a deep cup so that people 
will think it is bouillon." There is also a description of the colorful parade, 
"with Buffalo Bill mounted on a Moorish horse given to General Grant by the 
Sultan." While the essays do not offer much to chew over, they are fascinating 
both as a contemporary view and as a glimpse at what Latin America was reading 
about the United States.

Lee Dembart's review of Ronald Siegel's book, "Intoxication," (Book Review, 
July 23), while well intentioned, misstates the major point. Never in the book 
did Siegel describe marijuana, cocaine or LSD as safe or "healthy and natural." 
He clearly states that these drugs, while appealing to a section of society, 
are potentially dangerous. In fact, he argues that such accepted drugs as 
caffeine are unsafe. Siegel's premise is that we have a clearly documented 
"fourth drive" for intoxication. But Dembart ignores Siegel's solution to the 
problem of unsafe drugs and the natural drive to pursue them. Siegel's answer 
is to change the pattern of usage and create "perfectly safe drugs." He 
believes that the war against these drugs must go on, but that substitutes 
should be created for them that can be used safely, without dysfunction to the 
individual or society. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel is not trying to return to the past, to the ideas of the '60s, as 
Dembart alludes. Rather, he is looking into the future and addressing an issue 
that only promises to become a continual and growing problem, unless it is 
looked at from a new perspective. It is obvious that although the war on drugs 
is necessary, it is not solving our nation's drug problem. As one drug becomes 
unfashionable or suppressed, it is replaced with another. Why not replace it 
with one that is safe to ourselves and to society?

POETRY AS PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've read in and supported the Cafe Largo poetry night club series discussed by 
Jack Miles because I believe actors have as much right as anyone to try poetry 
and even succeed at it. Dismissing their efforts by confusing their skill as 
performers with their skill as poets does nothing but obfuscate the underlying 
intimate relation between the making of the poem and the public sharing of it. 
The poem is something we had to write but it is also something we want, like 
the bards of old, to sing and shout. 
</P>
<P>
Whether there's really a "shift" to performance is debatable. Certainly 
"performance art," a loosely defined multimedia conglomeration, is a new 
20th-Century genre, but it is a mistake to confuse the performance of poetry 
with the poetic aspects of performance art. Poets have performed their poems 
since Homer, with and without embellishments. Maybe poet/actor Michael Lally 
and poet Eve Brandstein, founders of 'Poetry in Motion', noticed some incipient 
talent among fellow actors and foster this by giving them a place to perform. 
Maybe the exploding L.A. poetry scene is becoming so exciting and vibrant that 
everyone is attracted to it, even celebrities. Anybody out there ever hear of a 
bloke named Shakespeare?

Lee Dembart's provocative review of "Intoxication" has provoked me, not to read 
the book, but to offer to Prof. Siegel for his experiments one 6-foot, 7-inch, 
30-year-old male hominid, "healthy as an ox" but for an emergency room visit 
for what I suspect was a miscalculation in dosage. 
</P>
<P>
This specimen has been in what appears to me to be Siegel's "fourth drive" and 
"feeling different" for about 14 years, and generally behaving like Siegel's 
other laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
My specimen has adopted a "minimalist" life style (working three hours in the 
afternoons) which provides him with enough revenue to "discover the pleasurable 
effects" of some substances; I provide him shelter. He goes into a trance-like 
condition for 11-12 hours, which is seemingly sufficient for him to recover his 
motor functions, and go back to work. My own observations corroborate Siegel's 
findings that whatever these substances he appears to be using are, they are 
not, with the technicality of over-dosing excepted, harmful to his physical 
health. 
</P>
<P>
I fear he is going to outlive me. I fear my successor will be the gutter and 
the gospel mission. Therefore, my offer to Prof. Siegel is not entirely 
magnanimous. By taking this individual into his lab, the professor can resolve 
this "care and maintenance" issue for me, and hopefully for others through his 
findings.

POETRY AS PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think what Jack Miles said in "Slept Through Any Poetry Lately?" (Book 
Review, July 23) was that despite the current trend toward performance of 
literature, in general he favors the one-to-one relationship between reader and 
poem, novel, etc. If so, then I agree. I came away from this column, however, 
with sufficient ambivalence that I have to believe it reflects, at least in 
part, his own mixed feelings. Perhaps also my own. 
</P>
<P>
I disagree totally with the concept of a poem whose only merit lies in its 
recited performance. I am equally certain that the well-written poem will also 
perform well. Not long ago I listened to David Whyte read, in his marvelous 
Yorkshire accent, Neruda (in Spanish and English), Rilke (German and English), 
Akhmatova, David Wagonner and Beowulf, Kabir, and his own poetry, in a setting 
truly a gift from the gods: at Esalen overlooking the cliffs, high above the 
Pacific, nothing between us and the next land but six thousand miles of water, 
sky, and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
But all of those writers enriched mankind before Whyte, and will continue, 
though I consider myself blessed to have heard him. The writer's commitment is 
to a sheet of paper, his inner world, and that of his reader. Whatever else 
follows is serendipity (or synchronicity). All the better, if they also sing 
their brilliance, not only in our mind's ear, but at Cafe Largo or Esalen or 
the Pomona 20. 
</P>
<P>
Miles said it well: "The great strength of fiction was that it contained its 
own set, lights, sounds, special effects within itself."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MAGDALENA &amp; BALTHASAR BY STEVEN OZMENT YALE UNIVERSITY

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
The letters Balthasar Paumgartner, a traveling merchant from Nuremburg, and his 
fiancee and later wife, Magdalena Behaim, exchanged between 1582 and 1598 offer 
a rare look at daily middle-class life in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, their mundane stolidity makes them interesting. Balthasar obviously 
hated his work and left an increasing number of details to be overseen by his 
capable spouse. Magdalena's concern for her husband's health (she urges him to 
be bled regularly), her requests for a toy horse for their son, her sad list of 
friends who die of plague and other diseases, resonate through the intervening 
centuries and provide a personal counterpoint to the deeds of kings that fill 
conventional histories. Steven Ozment's thorough notes provide useful 
background, although he tends to repeat information contained in the letters.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: VIDEO NIGHT IN KATHMANDU AND OTHER REPORTS FROM THE 
NOT-SO-FAR EAST BY PICO IYER VINTAGE: $9.95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pico Iyer began traveling in Asia, he planned to chronicle the increasing 
Westernization of the continent's ancient cultures. He discovered that while 
America remains the model of the good, materialistic, modern life, the East is 
overtaking the West, absorbing and transforming its ideas and products -- and, 
often, selling them back in new guises. 
</P>
<P>
As he recounts his (mis)adventures, Iyer offers entertaining descriptions of 
the baroque excesses of the Indian cinema, the frenetic capitalism of Hong 
Kong, baseball mania in Japan and the seedy night life of Manila and Bangkok. 
This fascinating account of cultural cross-pollination is marred only by the 
author's tendency to write too much about himself, like a tourist who comes 
home with snapshots of his friends standing in front of slightly fuzzy 
monuments.

Raymond Carver's short stories suggest the prose equivalent to blues songs: 
brief vignettes of tough times, unfaithful lovers, unhappy lives, the ravages 
of alcohol. Unlike Dorothy Parker, who suffered with her characters, Carver 
remains a detached observer of their pain, delineating miniature dramas in a 
few spare sentences. His characters remain trapped in circumstances beyond 
their control, and the tone of impotent inevitability only increases the 
poignancy of their plight.

NEWSMAKERS: INVENTION WAS HIS TRUE CALLING

 -- Next time you touch someone from a pay phone, think of William Gray, who -- 
100 years ago today -- filed U.S. Patent No. 408,709 for "A Coin-Controlled 
Apparatus for Telephones." As usual, necessity played a role. Gray's foreman at 
a Connecticut factory had refused to let him use the company phone to call his 
sick wife, even though he had offered to pay. The first pay phone was installed 
at the Hartford Bank, and there are now more than 2 million of them in the 
United States alone, from the White House to the middle of Death Valley. 
Intellicall, a manufacturer of private pay phones, notes these landmarks: The 
first outdoor pay phone booth was installed in Cincinnati in 1905; the use of 
slugs cost New York Telephone $417,370 in 1935; the first phone booth with a 
double-hinged door was installed in 1910, and Clark Kent first used a phone 
booth as a changing room in the September-October, 1949, issue of D.C. Comics. 
Gray went on to conquer other challenges, inventing an inflatable chest 
protector for baseball catchers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another invention, the toll booth, evokes other sentiments. Residents in 
Jacksonville, Fla., this weekend are celebrating the end of 36 years of tolls 
in their community. "We have taken a quantum leap forward in improving the 
quality of life for our city," Mayor Tommy Hazouri said at ceremonies Friday on 
the Mathews Bridge, which opened in 1953. Tolls also ended, thanks to a newly 
enacted half-cent city sales tax, on three other bridges and an expressway. The 
atmosphere on the Mathews Bridge was festive, with crowds cheering, horns 
honking and the St. Johns River City Band playing. Fireworks went off. The 
mayor and Chester Stokes, chairman of the Jacksonville Transportation 
Authority, climbed aboard a large yellow crane, and with the help of a crane 
operator, toppled several toll booths. The Florida Times-Union proclaimed: 
"Un-tolled joy: KEEP THE CHANGE." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Navy isn't talking, but the producers of a video showing Cher in a 
revealing body stocking singing to hundreds of sailors on the battleship 
Missouri said they were told that the top brass in Washington feels tarnished. 
The clip was shot on Independence Day on the deck where Japan surrendered to 
the Allied forces in 1945, but the Navy apparently was unaware of the video's 
sexual overtones. "When you OK Cher's presence on board you have to expect the 
unexpected," a spokeswoman for the singer told Reuters. LARRY PRYOR

COCHABAMBA, Bolivia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When this city of 350,000 goes to bed, it is time for Sister Stephany and 
Father Henry to load bread and plastic jugs of hot milk onto their pickup truck 
and set out into the night. 
</P>
<P>
They go in search of the hundreds of children whose only home is the streets. 
</P>
<P>
A third of the children they will find, some as young as 5, are cocaine-paste 
addicts or sniffers of glue or gasoline. Others have been abandoned by their 
parents or come from homes of unemployed workers where there is not enough 
food. Many survive by selling cigarettes laced with cocaine paste or by petty 
thievery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Prosperity 
</P>
<P>
At least 2,000 children and youths roam the streets of this city, which is 
prospering from the cocaine produced in the Chapare, a subtropical region 110 
miles to the northeast, where 80% of the coca leaf grown in Bolivia is 
processed into cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
When Sister Stephany Murray, 68, who was born in Emmittsburg, Md., and the Rev. 
Patrick Henry, 47, of Omaha, find the children, they pass out the bread and the 
hot milk in plastic cups. 
</P>
<P>
"Distributing milk gives us a chance to make contact with them and make them 
feel we are indeed interested in them and they are not outcasts of society," 
Murray said. "It is a friendly contact. If they are on drugs we try to tell 
them they can do better and we are ready to receive them when they are ready to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
She and Henry operate two Roman Catholic Amanecer (Dawn) shelters for homeless 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Order, has been working in 
Cochabamba for 25 years. Henry is on leave from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of Omaha to work as a Maryknoll missionary in Cochabamba. He has been here five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
They said they distribute bread and milk to 150 to 200 children two nights a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids leave home because there is nothing to eat," Murray said. 
"They start shining shoes, they lose contact with their families and they find 
it easier to steal or sell cigarettes laced with cocaine paste." 
</P>
<P>
Organizations that work with homeless youths say the number of street children 
and cases of youth drug addiction in Cochabamba and other cities have increased 
in the last five years chiefly because of Bolivia's economic difficulties and 
the availability of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is more than 20%, 35,000 government workers have been laid off in 
the last five years as part of the government's austerity program and, 
according to the United Nations Children's Fund, 45% of rural children suffer 
from malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
The Amanecer centers provide temporary lodging for street children, along with 
rehabilitation and training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about everybody on the streets has used drugs and practically all of them 
have had involvement in drug trafficking," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the youths interviewed at an Amanecer shelter said they had worked 
in the cocaine-producing Chapare region. They told of being arrested by police 
and taken to a labor camp for drug offenders in the Chapare. At least five 
youths have died at the camp under suspicious circumstances in the last two 
years, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Children in the Chapare transport chemicals while their parents as well as 
youths macerate coca leaves into cocaine with the first priority being to 
provide food to live on," said Laura Baldivieso, a psychologist and head of the 
U.S.-financed Drug Information Center. "But the Chapare, instead of resolving 
the economic problems of the unemployed, is contributing to a deterioration of 
the family and the social structure." 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the kids who come to our center have tread on coca leaves in the 
Chapare," Henry said. "They are paid $20 a night to stomp on coca leaves and 
often part of the payment is in the form of paste." 
</P>
<P>
Many youths arrive from the Chapare with festering wounds or ill with 
parasite-borne diseases, yellow fever or tuberculosis, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
"They become exhausted from working all night and for lack of food," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago people would say that drugs were a North American problem. They 
can't say it anymore because drug use has become so much more widespread and 
there is cocaine everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
After midnight on El Prado, a tree-lined avenue bordered by restaurants and 
snack shops, Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indian children roam the streets, 
often selling paste-laced cigarettes for traffickers to people from all social 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Police cars sometimes stop to question them, but Murray said they often 
threaten to take the children to jail unless they hand over money, usually the 
equivalent of $5. 
</P>
<P>
"Street kids tell me, 'If I don't have the money, I will be mistreated so I 
better have enough,' and this encourages stealing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Jailed 
</P>
<P>
Although it is illegal to put a child in jail, the organization Defense for 
Children-International says dozens of children are rounded up every night and 
kept overnight or several days without food or blankets in dark and filthy jail 
cells alongside hardened criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"At its base, the cocaine and street kid problem in Cochabamba is an economic 
one," Henry said. "Unfortunately there is no industry that can take up the 
slack if cocaine stopped. It would be an overwhelming switch to have all these 
people come back from the Chapare when there are no jobs. There are people who 
are desperate and are living a very thin line. They won't get rich, but at 
least they will feed their families."

FARMERS CREATE VACUUM IN A WAR AGAINST HARMFUL INSECTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVICES LIFT BUGS OFF CROPS, REDUCE NEED FOR CHEMICALS 
</P>

DELANO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of zapping bugs by sucking them off crops instead of spraying them 
with toxic pesticides is causing a proliferation of names playing on "vac," as 
in vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
It all started last year when Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc. of 
Watsonville designed a machine called a BugVac that uses just enough suction to 
remove lygus bugs from the tops of berry plants while not disturbing beneficial 
bugs that congregate farther down the plant. 
</P>
<P>
That idea helped spur Salinas-based Tanimura &amp; Antle Inc., the nation's 
second-largest lettuce grower, to develop a machine called Salad-Vac to vacuum 
bad bugs off lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes VAC-US, designed by two Delano men for use on grapes and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
The Delano device consists of a specially designed, five-horsepower hydraulic 
fan that collects bugs in wire mesh bags after sucking them off plants, said 
Harold Nelson, who designed VAC-US with Don Neumann, his partner in Daco Farm 
Supply. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-pound vacuum units can be frame-mounted in several configurations to 
accommodate individual requirements of farmers, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Neumann have begun field tests of a six-unit, tractor-mounted implement 
with three units on each side hydraulically positioned around a row of 
grapevines. They think it could be profitable because the cost of about $20,000 
for an eight-unit VAC-US is considerably less than other types developed so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
A VAC-US unit on top of the vines and one on each side can remove up to half 
the flying insects on the plants as the tractor moves between rows, Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it doesn't eradicate all flying pests in a single application, 
Nelson thinks VAC-US will be valuable as another tool to let growers rely less 
on pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a replacement for chemicals," he said. "We're a tool to help reduce 
the amount of chemicals needed. People are looking at how to reduce pesticides, 
and this is another concept." 
</P>
<P>
However, Nelson thinks repeated vacuumings will remove most flying insects, and 
the number of times a grower would need to vacuum plants depends on a 
particular insect's life cycle. He estimated that a single application of 
pesticides would cost about as much as three sweeps of a field with VAC-US. 
</P>
<P>
It can be used to remove leaf hoppers, white flies, moths, weevils, thrips and 
lygus bugs from strawberries, grapes and cotton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After flying insects are sucked off the plants, beneficial predator insects can 
be introduced to eliminate mites and other bugs, Nelson said. The wire mesh 
bags are designed with openings large enough to allow some surviving predators 
to escape.

A British boys' school run by Roman Catholic monks has scrapped an experiment 
in admitting girls, saying its sporty regimen was too macho for them. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Abbey School, near Hereford in western England, has become the first 
British fee-paying school to return to single-sex status after becoming 
coeducational. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the decision on educational grounds. There was no scandal, no 
pregnancies and we are not misogynists," headmaster Father Christopher Jenkins 
said.

HONG KONG WIELDS NEW ANTI-DRUG LAW

<P>
Hong Kong police are being given a powerful new weapon to combat the flow of 
illegal drugs through the British colony, but it could end up putting the 
government in the nightclub business. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Stuart McDouall, head of a new police task force on drug finances, said a 
law taking effect Sept. 1 is aimed at drying up the finances of the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
The Drug Trafficking Bill gives the courts the right to confiscate everything a 
convicted drug trafficker owns. More important, however, it allows for 
suspected drug traffickers' assets to be frozen before trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The government could also end up running the business owned by suspects, 
although it might be through civilian receivers," McDouall said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Businesses Going 
</P>
<P>
"It is in the government's interest to keep those businesses going, no matter 
whether they are bars, restaurants or nightclubs," he said. "Otherwise, the 
government will be open to being sued for compensation if the suspect is 
acquitted." 
</P>
<P>
McDouall's force will have the power to investigate all assets of traffickers 
and apply for their sequestration if they are believed to have come from the 
drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the law, the traffickers were going to prison but the money kept going 
around. Now we have the real weapons to hit the drug trade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McDouall gave as an example a conviction gained by the Narcotics Bureau last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street-Level Trafficker 
</P>
<P>
"When we started to look at this case in 1984, the man was a street-level 
trafficker and not very well off. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we caught him four years later, he had built himself up to being a 
syndicated drug dealer, trading wholesale quantities of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The fixed assets he had accumulated were worth a total of $2.56 million U.S., 
including one factory and its shop outlet, six public transport minibuses, two 
taxis and three residential flats." 
</P>
<P>
"Those were just his fixed assets without checking his bank accounts," he 
added. "Had we had this law then, we would have been able to freeze his 
accounts and identify all his assets which would be viable targets for 
confiscation." 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, there were 44 court cases on drug trafficking presented by the 
Narcotics Bureau alone," McDouall said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Demand 
</P>
<P>
Local traffickers are not only supplying local demand but also venturing into 
the international market for quick profits. 
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. government report, rough estimates indicate that half of 
the uncut heroin imported into Hong Kong for transshipment is intended for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that Hong Kong is a money-laundering center for drug 
traffickers in Asia, or probably in the world," said McDouall. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans guessed Hong Kong is the second biggest money-laundering center 
in the world behind Panama. But it may or may not be true as it is impossible 
to tell the size of the operation." 
</P>
<P>
The British colony is seen as a convenient location for money-laundering 
because of its status as a major financial center with banking secrecy laws and 
no foreign exchange controls. 
</P>
<P>
McDouall said drug traffickers were using more sophisticated financial services 
offered by bankers and accountants to hide their assets from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be an uphill battle all the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, bankers are obliged to report any transaction they suspect 
is drug-related.

MISSISSIPPI TOWN'S WHITES REBEL AT MINORITY STATUS 
</P>

FRIARS POINT, Miss. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White residents are seeking what blacks in many Southern cities spent decades 
fighting for -- a voice in their government. 
</P>
<P>
Only 15% of the 1,300 residents of Friars Point, a Mississippi Delta hamlet, 
are white. Blacks fill all five positions on the Board of Aldermen. The last 
white alderman, Charles Wilson, lost a bid for reelection in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the rights of a white minority be any different than the rights of 
a black minority?" asks John Yount, who started a petition drive asking the 
board to create four wards, one with a 65% white voting-age population, with a 
fifth alderman to be elected at large. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Accountability 
</P>
<P>
Under a ward system, Yount said: "I don't know if a black man or a white man 
will be elected out of our district, but at least he would be accountable to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Yount said he passed the petition among about 80% of the nearly 200 whites in 
Friars Point, and received only 20 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
There is little opposition to a ward system, but some question whether it 
should be drawn along the racial lines proposed by Yount. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see -- mathematically, no way -- that we could draw a line putting all 
of the white people in the district and come up with a 65% ward," said Mayor 
James Washington, who is black. "There's no way." 
</P>
<P>
But Washington added that he and the board favor a ward system. 
</P>
<P>
Town attorney Hunter Twiford said he had prepared a recommendation for changing 
the town government to a ward system and planned to present his proposals to 
the board. The board then must decide whether to order a demographic study for 
drawing up the wards. 
</P>
<P>
If the board does vote to change, it would have to get U.S. Justice Department 
approval under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which requires prior approval of 
all election changes in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Friars Point was founded in the early 1830s by John Friar, who came ashore by 
flatboat from St. Louis. The river town in northern Mississippi prospered for 
about 50 years in the days of the steamboat until railroads took over, then 
became a mostly white farming community. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1940s, mechanization pushed black field hands into town looking for 
work, and whites gradually became the minority. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 whites live in a sliver of suburbia near the Mississippi River levee, 
surrounded by larger black neighborhoods. Blacks work for whites, rarely vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
Yount says the ward system is the whites' only chance of getting 
representation, and that they will go to court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to decrease the authority of the board," said Yount, 42, who 
manages the main office of a farming operation in nearby Marks. "If (Wilson) 
had been reelected this past time, this would never have come about. We have 
houses there, we have property there. We want to be involved in city 
government."

DAUGHTER OF LAWYERS WED RANCHER, NEW WAY OF LIFE

<TEXT>
<P>
Annie Debevoise, a granddaughter, daughter and sister of lawyers, thought she 
would take some time off to work out West before returning to law school in 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she hired on as a $9,000-a-year organizer with the Northern Plains 
Resource Council, a rural advocacy group based in Billings, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
As a single woman of 26, she took a lot of kidding from the cattlemen and their 
wives, who were always trying to fix her up. One day a bunch of cowboys 
standing around at the local grain elevator dared her to drive the 16 miles 
over back roads to Andy Ostby's house and introduce herself. 
</P>
<P>
She did. Now, at 28, she is Annie Ostby, ranch wife. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of torts and statutes, she has learned how to brand a calf, play 
midwife to a cow and load up a pack horse. 
</P>
<P>
There is no vacation in the winter because the cattle have to be fed. In the 
spring the calves are being born, and there is no time off in the summer, 
either, because the crops have to be harvested. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy's told me we might squeeze in a week in November," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While hundreds of Montana women are seeking employment off the land because 
they need earn extra money, Ostby says she feels lucky to be able to stay home 
and learn about her new life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I take it one day at a time," she said, sitting on the porch of her 
37-year-old husband's family home. The house is surrounded by rolling green 
fields of wheat and grass. The nearest neighbors are out of sight, over the 
next rise. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to learn everything I can, I want to be Andy's partner, I want to help 
make this the best ranch it can be."

<P>
Sean Varner's family lived in a shelter for the homeless. The teen-ager owned 
few clothes, was failing in school and considered dropping out. Then John Hogan 
entered his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed someone to talk to," said Varner, now 17 and a senior at McKinley 
Senior High School . "I couldn't talk to my mother and I've only seen my father 
once. It was the lowest point I ever reached." 
</P>
<P>
Hogan, a doctor who works in the emergency rooms of Howard University and D.C. 
General hospitals, became Varner's mentor. They were matched 18 months ago by 
Mentors Inc., a nonprofit agency that has set up mentorship programs at seven 
Washington public schools. With Hogan's encouragement and support, Varner 
turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courted by Colleges 
</P>
<P>
This year Varner earned the highest score at McKinley on the Preliminary 
Scholastic Achievement Test. A host of colleges are courting him. His 
conversations are peppered with talk about his future, about college and a 
career as an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Sean Varner illustrates how concerned adults are touching the 
lives of troubled youths around the country through mentoring programs. It is 
the perfect answer for a generation of people who have time to volunteer and a 
desire to help solve some of the problems plaguing young people in inner 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say they want to help, but don't know how," said Shayne 
Schneider, president of the 2-year-old Mentors Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my mentors see themselves as a link in a chain," Schneider said. "They 
had a mentor and they want to be a mentor." 
</P>
<P>
Most of her mentors "are African-Americans, a slight majority are women," she 
said. They are generally college-educated and in their 30s and 40s. The No. 1 
reason that youths give for wanting a mentor is to have somebody to talk to, 
said Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Programs Proliferate 
</P>
<P>
The programs are cropping up everywhere and have varying goals, though they all 
seem to deal ultimately with increasing a youth's self-esteem. The Greater 
Washington Board of Trade runs a program aimed at academically average 
students, and it pairs the students with mentors who will help them identify 
short- and long-term goals, including finishing school and planning a career. 
</P>
<P>
A University of the District of Columbia radio station set up a mentorship 
program in which black men serve as mentors to black pupils at Malcolm X 
Elementary School to help them "establish a blueprint for success," one mentor 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Churches, schools and community organizations are starting their own programs. 
When the Federal National Mortgage Assn., known as Fannie Mae, started a 
scholarship fund for youths at Woodson High School here, a mentor program was 
incorporated into it. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider said the 300 students in her programs are more motivated and are 
planning for further education. "As they . . . set goals, they see pregnancy 
and drugs as obstacles that would slow them down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But those are by no means children with perfect lives. A teen-age girl was very 
early in a pregnancy when matched with a mentor, who by coincidence was also 
pregnant. The girl was kicked out of her home and got married. Through it all, 
her mentor guided her, pushed her to continue school, took her to the doctor 
for prenatal care and helped her prepare for motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months pregnant, the young woman attended school from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
and worked at a McDonald's from 4 p.m. until 11 p.m. Then Mentors Inc. gave her 
$400 so she could stay home until her baby was born. Today, she is a mother, 
but also a senior and honor student. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Johnson, author of "The Endangered Black Male" who helped radio station 
WDCU-FM set up its program, said formal mentorship programs are needed because 
informal nurturing relationships are not forming as frequently as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbers, ministers, beauticians and many church people have mentored children 
in their communities," Johnson said. "What has changed is the natural process 
of mentoring, interrupted by the flight of the middle class and the 
disintegration of families. 
</P>
<P>
"The rite of passage for success has become the ability to leave one's 
neighborhood," Johnson said. "That means isolation for the truly disadvantaged 
and a decline in role models. The new (middle-class) black man's burden is how 
to become successful without leaving the poor black person behind." 
</P>
<P>
In the WDCU-FM program, mentors tutor students each Saturday and attend 
workshops held for the youths' parents. The men also visit the children in 
their classrooms and take them on trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Boys Change 
</P>
<P>
Joseph A. Carter Jr., assistant principal at Malcolm X, asked Ernest White, the 
radio station's public affairs director, for help after he noticed how boys 
changed between the third and fourth grades. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the summer before fourth grade something happens. They returned 
to school angry, with clenched fists, pent-up hostility. They were absent from 
school a lot more, " Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought a lack of positive role models might have something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
There are 32 boys in the program, Carter said. Each Saturday they are tutored 
in math and reading. On a recent Saturday, during a downpour, 10 boys sauntered 
in at 10 a.m. for their weekly two-hour tutoring. Fourteen mentors stood 
waiting. The mentors passed out pencils and work sheets with problems suggested 
by a counselor at Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken a year to get their respect," said mentor Ben Hawley. "They're used 
to people dropping money for programs and leaving. But we're here for life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Children 
</P>
<P>
The mentors whispered questions such as, "What did you eat for breakfast?" 
"What time did you get up?" "What time did you go to sleep?" They patted the 
children on their backs for jobs well done. 
</P>
<P>
During the second hour they read aloud articles on famous Africans and black 
American men such as poet Langston Hughes, musician-composer Duke Ellington and 
Shaka Zulu. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaka Zulu was real? I thought he was just a movie," said one boy, who had 
seen a television program about the southern Africa warrior. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Wade, 9, was reading about Paul Robeson when his father, Lee Wade, walked 
in. "This is doing a lot for him," the father said. "His school skills have 
improved. He enjoys it. I've been sick and so there's a lot I can't do with him 
because of my health. This program is exactly what the doctor ordered." 
</P>
<P>
While Carter said he has not seen "landslide" changes in his boys, he noted, "I 
see boys liking school, peer pressure moving from where you are a nerd because 
you like school to a group of guys who say it's OK to come to school." 
</P>
<P>
White has noticed that mentoring is an infinite number of small steps. He is 
mentor to three students at Malcolm X. He recalls taking one young boy to a 
restaurant. The waiter brought the menu and White was looking it over when he 
noticed the boy was crying. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do it!" the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
White discovered it was the boy's first time sitting down in a full-service 
restaurant. He generally ate at fast-food establishments. After more tears, a 
little time and some encouragement from White, the young protege ordered from a 
hand-held menu for the first time in his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can take him anywhere to eat," said White. "If he doesn't know what 
something is, he asks the waiter." 
</P>
<P>
"Sean was very shy, not very sure of himself," Hogan said. "He told me he was 
an A student, but he had Ds and Fs in his classes. I asked what did he want to 
do and he went on about engineering and computers and college. I'm sitting 
there saying, 'Man, you better wake up.' " 
</P>
<P>
After a few more meetings, Hogan said he realized that the youth was very 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we relieved some of the pressure, his grades went from Ds, Fs to four As, 
Bs in one grade period. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be a hole in my soul if I did not get satisfaction out of seeing 
what happened with Sean," said Hogan. "But I can't take credit for it. I don't 
go to school for him or tutor him in his subjects. All Sean needed was a 
helping hand."

A letter carrier has pleaded guilty to drug charges after admitting that he 
took telephone orders at the post office and delivered cocaine to some 
customers along his route. 
</P>
<P>
Isaiah Millings, 33, pleaded guilty last week to six drug-related counts in 
exchange for a two-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Postal inspectors and police secretly filmed Millings as he sold cocaine while 
delivering mail and as he transported the drug on other occasions using his 
official Postal Service vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Police and post inspectors also taped Millings taking cocaine orders over the 
telephone at the post office. 
</P>
<P>
Millings' supplier, Antonio F. Brown, 49, also pleaded guilty and was sentenced 
to 10 years in prison. Brown, a native of Panama who entered the United States 
illegally, has a long criminal record and was wanted by police in South 
Carolina for escape.

TRAIL ADVOCATES PUSHING TO GET PLAN BACK ON TRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
When Jim Miller wants to air it out, really let the workaday cares melt away 
and commune a bit with nature, he saddles up his 15-year-old quarter horse, 
Pat, and heads into the San Diego County outback on a trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some wonderful experiences," said Miller, a real estate attorney who 
lives in La Mesa. "I'll go on one of those hills above Sweetwater Reservoir and 
see a couple hundred Canada geese circle and circle and come in on the lake. 
The honkers are just yakking and they set their wings and come skiing in. It's 
quite a sight." 
</P>
<P>
Miller worries, however, that the tidal wave of development in many parts of 
the fast-growing county could shut out residents in the years to come from the 
chance to enjoy the sort of backcountry pleasures that can be experienced only 
by hitting a trail. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a cadre of trail advocates, Miller is pushing these days for the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors to reinstitute a moribund plan outlining a 
network of hiking and horseback riding trails to be developed throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The trail plan was undermined by a pro-growth board in the early 1980s. 
Battered but not defeated, trail boosters now want to see the plan returned to 
its original vigor, complete with provisions requiring property owners to grant 
easements for future trails as their land is developed. 
</P>
<P>
Although such actions could spark opposition from property rights advocates 
concerned about losing exclusive use of their land, backers of a trail network 
contend that the effort to preserve existing trails and establish new ones must 
move forward before time runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"The more subdivisions the county puts through, the more trail opportunities we 
lose," said Miller, president of the San Diego County Trails Council. "It's 
simply not fair to future generations for someone to say the property they are 
developing for resale to new residents should be excluded from properly 
designed recreational uses." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the county's trail network has advanced only when developers 
were willing to voluntarily dedicate a public right-of-way for a trail. All too 
often, builders simply chose not to grant the easements, and the result has 
been a patchwork system missing numerous key links. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tantamount to developing a road system and saying that no one has to 
provide a road unless they want to," said Jack Redfern, the county's trails 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the trail network say the plan is a cost-effective way to provide 
recreational opportunities and ensure that residents will be able to enjoy the 
open space areas that remain after the dust of the development boom settles.

"In most cases, studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between 
the quality of health and decreased crime in areas which provide open space," 
said Dick Hubbard, a leader of the North County Trails Coalition, a group 
advocating the countywide trail network. "From an economic point of view, open 
space and recreational amenities pay for themselves. Trails can be provided at 
little or no cost and provide maximum recreational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Bender, a horsewoman who enjoys the trails around her Rancho Santa Fe home, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They provide such a great benefit for an area," Bender said. "They're a crime 
deterrent, and they get people to get out in the community. So often, people 
live their lives just getting in the car and going from the garage to the store 
and back again." 
</P>
<P>
Miller emphasized that trails mapped out in the plan would be dedicated as a 
public right of way only when a piece of property is submitted to planners for 
a development project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not putting a trail across anyone's living room, we're not going to put 
it across the corner of their vacant property," he said. "It's done when the 
property is developed." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he argues that the trails add to a parcel's price tag, adding an 
amenity that serves as a potent drawing card when houses sprout from the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Any developer who has any sense of fair play plus a natural acumen to make 
money should just be overjoyed and tickled pink to work with the county and 
whatever city to provide trails," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential pitfalls may be raised by a handful of opponents, but Miller and 
others see ready answers. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance costs? Most trails virtually take care of themselves, with hoof, 
foot and mountain bike traffic keeping the path smooth, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Liability risks? Miller says he has not found anywhere in the state where a 
government agency has paid a damage award for an injury sustained on an 
officially sanctioned trail. 
</P>
<P>
Trail boosters envision an integrated system with major trails, such as the 
California Riding and Hiking Trail and the proposed San Dieguito River Valley 
Park Trail, linked up with smaller paths leading from suburban communities. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the county has more than 50 miles of trails formally dedicated for 
public use. Other existing trails, however, have yet to be recognized as 
official rights of way. Still others remain a glimmer in the eye of trail 
advocates eager to see the rural outback crisscrossed by a web of interlinking 
dirt pathways. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Board of Supervisors has yet to take up the issue of a countywide 
trail network, the group increasingly seems to be favoring the idea. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the board has approved trail systems in several unincorporated 
sections of the county, including Rancho Santa Fe and Ramona. Advocates were 
upset, however, when members of the board failed to show for a meeting in April 
that drew nearly 200 supporters of the trail plan.

THREE-HOUR BASEBALL GAME IS REALLY THROWING WAIT AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Give this game an alarm clock, or a tea break. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's dead time is excruciating to sit through. Even Baltimore Orioles 
Manager Frank Robinson grows fidgety in the dugout waiting for the pitchers to 
pitch and the batters to hit. 
</P>
<P>
A pitcher wiping his hand across his brow, his cap, tugging at his belt, 
looking for the sign, shaking off the sign, looking for another sign, getting 
set, looking in again, and finally ... throwing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, when you're out of the groove, you back off," Robinson said. "But when 
you're throwing strikes, let's go." 
</P>
<P>
Don't just blame the pitchers. Look at the batters. The player stepping away 
from the plate, calling time to take a stroll up the third-base line, going 
back to the dugout to grab the pine-tar rag, stepping back into the batter's 
box, and finally -- after the pitcher goes through his routine again -- 
swinging at the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"No one just stands in the batter's box anymore," Robinson said. "Pine tar. 
Batting gloves. Some of them even look at the sky." 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make a person reach for another cup of coffee to stay up past 
his bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just stretching the game out," Robinson said. "In the old days, a 
2-hour, 20-minute game was long. Now, it's short." 
</P>
<P>
Tick. Tick. Tick. 
</P>
<P>
With all the ills plaguing major-league baseball -- the Pete Rose saga, labor 
problems, sagging national television ratings, rumblings of an alternative 
league -- length of games might not be a pressing concern for owners or 
players. And no one is about to introduce a clock into a timeless event. But 
time affects everyone else -- from fans to concession workers to 
groundskeepers. 
</P>
<P>
"You remember 'Two-Hour' Mike Cuellar? He'd be 'Three-Hour' Mike now," said Pat 
Santarone, head groundskeeper at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. "In the old 
days, if a game went 2:15, people would get furious. Now, everyone has to take 
in the scenery." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the average nine-inning American League game took 2:32 to complete. 
This season, an average nine-inning American League game lasts 2:49. In the 
National League -- which produces fewer runs because it has no designated 
hitters -- nine-inning averages increased from 2:31 in 1979 to 2:42 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't exactly earth-shaking material. Every few years, there is grumbling 
about the length of games. In the mid-1960s, the American League experimented 
with an unofficial, 20-second clock between pitches. Oakland Athletics owner 
Charles O. Finley even suggested shortening games by making three balls a walk 
and two strikes a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
But the games dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
At the current rate of time inflation, baseball will crack the 
three-hour-average barrier before the next century. Who knows? By then, 
four-hour football games might become standard. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about the length of the games all the time," said Bryan Burns, an 
official in the baseball commissioner's office. "We'll never turn to our 
players and say, 'Hurry up."' 
</P>
<P>
But teams are adjusting to the new time standards. The Minnesota Twins pushed 
up the starting time of their weeknight games from 7:35 to 7:05. The Baltimore 
Orioles also are discussing the possibility of moving Friday night starts from 
8:05 to 7:35 next season. 
</P>
<P>
Teams also are attempting to entertain fans during the two-minute break between 
innings. Video montages on scoreboard telescreens, mascots and rock music are 
some of the devices used to keep the fans from dozing off or leaving early. 
</P>
<P>
"While the game times have increased, baseball has become more sophisticated 
entertaining the fans," said Andy MacPhail, executive vice president and 
general manager of the Twins. "The games may be 18 to 20 minutes longer, but 
the time is better filled. I don't mean to cheapen the game with silliness, 
whistles and bells. I do believe people have a good time at the games. I think 
the ballparks are better and more exciting places to be than 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Folks are spending more time in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see an enjoyable game, the time doesn't matter," said Jim Kaat, who 
played 25 years in the major leagues, won 283 games and rarely started a game 
that took longer than 2:15. "It's not that you want to get the game over with 
in a hurry. But it's boring to see guys waste time." 
</P>
<P>
Kaat and others point to three major reasons for the lengthening of games in 
the last decade: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The creation of relief specialists. Using a middle reliever, setup man and 
closer takes time, as the pitchers shuttle in and out of the game, take warm-up 
tosses and then face the batters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The two-minute gap between innings. Before 1985, there was no standard 
break between innings, according to Burns. A two-minute minimum was imposed, 
giving television a natural and standard commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Playing styles. In the 1960s, batters got into the box, took their cuts and 
left. Pitchers pitched. Now, many players take their time before performing. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who have averaged 2:48 for nine-inning games this season, are 
loaded with young pitchers who take their time and often work to full counts. 
Most Orioles hitters rarely leave the batter's box between pitches, but Steve 
Finley, Cal Ripken and Bill Ripken are among the more deliberate players in the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
Orioles pitching coach Al Jackson said he doesn't want to create a crew of 
marathoners. But he will not rush his staff to save time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are five or six clubs in this league, and we're part of it, who 
are slow," Jackson said. "I'm surprised some of the infielders and outfielders 
don't sit down. But these are developing pitchers. You have to take time and 
let them go at their own pace. But it's not just the pitchers. Some of these 
batters take vacations out there." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson would like to see quicker games. But like almost everyone else in 
baseball, he's not in a hurry to impose his standards on others. "The game is 
much more entertaining when it's played faster," he said. "You would see a 
better quality of play. The defense would be more alert. Just try standing for 
three hours. Your legs get tired. Your back hurts. You get worn out." 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness for dugouts.

DREAM COMES TRUE AT MEMORIAL STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was 20 years old, two years out of high school and driving a tractor. He 
drove to work in the middle of the night and waited for the truckers to come 
off the road with their loads of soft drink and whiskey bottles, and then he 
loaded the bottles on his truck and distributed them to dealerships around 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
One night, he was sitting in a diner across the street, waiting for the 
truckers, drinking coffee and reading the morning paper. A one-paragraph brief 
buried deep in the sports section caught his attention: the Orioles were having 
a tryout camp the next morning up at Cecil County Community College. "Hmmm, 
should I? " he thought, knowing full well it was a pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
Two years earlier, he had been no more than a mediocre high school pitcher, not 
even making the varsity until his senior year, when he had a 5-2 record and 
impressed exactly no scouts. 
</P>
<P>
His fastball was not fast; his best pitch'was a big, roundhouse curve, which 
had worked against neophyte high school batters but never would have fooled 
those in college or minor league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He had gone to a local community college planning to play baseball, but when 
some high school players he knew walked into the room on orientation day, he 
quit. On the spot. Those others players were too good. "I did not have 
outstanding physical tools then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years that he had driven a truck, however, those two years between 
the night of his high school graduation and that night when he read about the 
tryout camp, he had grown three inches and gained 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Some old friends from high school had seen him in a store one day and told him 
about this summer league team, and he showed up and started pitching again and 
discovered that he had a fastball that hummed. 
</P>
<P>
So, as he sat there in that diner in the middle of the night, drinking his 
coffee and waiting for the truckers to come in from West Virginia, he'decided 
to go to the tryout. It wasn't that he was unhappy with his lot. He was the son 
of a trucker, and he planned to catch on with United Parcel Service when he was 
old enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working a job, figuring that that was what I would do for the rest of my 
life," he said. "I was a perfectly happy camper. But I didn't even have to take 
off from work to go the tryout camp. It was on a Saturday. So I figured, 'Why 
not?' " 
</P>
<P>
The next day at the tryout, among the usual sea of luckless dreamgrs who show 
up at these camps wearing tennis shoes and carrying tattered gloves, he pitched 
three strong innings and was asked back to an invitation-only tryout. He 
pitched well again, then again a third time, in an All-Star game the Orioles 
sponsored. But no pro scouts called. The Orioles forgot about him. The only 
call came from the coach at the Community College of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make my mind up right there," he said. "I was working full time and I 
had a lot of bills to pay. I had to'decide whether I wanted to take a chance of 
losing my car and being financially strapped, all so I could go to college and 
play baseball and try to get drafted and be a pro one day. I decided it was 
worth a try." 
</P>
<P>
His daily schedule was exhausting. He took classes in the morning, played ball 
in the afternoon, went home to eat dinner and study, and then, when everyone 
else was going to sleep, drove back downtown to the Maryland National Bank 
building, where he worked in the computer room from midnight until 8 a.m., 
fixing automatic teller machines. Sleep? He caught a few hours when he could. 
</P>
<P>
He played two years at the Community College of Baltimore, and in the second he 
went 11-0 and led the team to the junior college world series. There, however, 
he flopped miserably, giving up 10 runs in two innings in one game and balking 
in the winning run in another. 
</P>
<P>
When he got home, he learned that, once again, his name had not been called in 
the major league draft. It was a discouraging day, one of his worst. "I thought 
11-0 would be enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was beginning to think about giving up baseball and going back to work. Two 
days later, the coach of one of the better local amateur teams called and asked 
if he wanted to pitch that night; the regular starter was sick. He said sure. 
He pitched a two-hitter, thinking nothing of it. There was one man watching in 
the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the phone rang. It turned out that that man in the bleachers, 
whom he had thought was one of the other players' father, was a scout for the 
PittsburghPirates. A contract was offered, and, minutes later, the phone rang 
again: it was the coach of the local amateur team, who also was a scout for the 
Orioles and knew that Pittsburgh was calling to offer a contract. 
</P>
<P>
The young pitcher suddenly had a decision to make, but it was not difficult. "I 
had made up my mind that, if it ever got to that, I would go with the first 
contract offered me," he said. Besides, truth be known, his pride still was 
hurt from how the Orioles had snubbed him after thetryout camp. So he signed a 
contract with Pittsburgh. There was no signing bonus. No guarantee. Nothing. 
Just a piece of paper with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, after being released once and traded once, after a career 
spent almost entirely in the minors, a life of long bus rides and cheap hotels 
and coming home for the winter to live in his mobile home near Baltimore and 
drive a truck again, he won his first major league game Tuesday night.

NEW YORK METS FINALLY SHIFT INTO HIGH GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They say they are the best. Just look at all the pitching, they tell you. They 
should dominate their division. They should blow away opponents and coast into 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a second. This is the New York Mets we're talking about? Look at their 
record. For four months, they've been ordinary. They win some, they lose some. 
Not exactly a force. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep the faith," Keith Hernandez said this week. "We don't jump the gun." 
</P>
<P>
At Shea Stadium, understatement is in. Underachievement, their detractors call 
it. Whatever, after four months of coasting, the New York Mets appear to be 
turning it on. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of waited like it was gonna happen," Hernandez said. "If it doesn't 
happen, then you've had an awful year as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Awful is the way they've played at times. There are reasons, primarily injuries 
to Dwight Gooden, Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez. But in New York, as the 
owner of the other team in town often says, the bottom line is all that counts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to the point of the year where we can't wait for other teams to 
fight our battles for us," Kevin McReynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if the Mets have been waiting all year. And the rest of baseball 
has been waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys can see the end of the line getting close," Howard Johnson said. 
"Now, it's not as long as it seems." 
</P>
<P>
It all seems so familiar. Just like last year, only more so. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 21, 1988, the Mets lost their fourth straight game and their lead was 
down to 3 1/2 games. Then they won 10 out of 12, lost two in a row, then won 13 
out of 14 to blow open the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
This year, they haven't been in first place since May 23. After losing to St. 
Louis on July 31, they were seven games out, in fourth place and on a 
seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Then they got Frank Viola. They've won nine of 11 since, losing twice by one 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"We're feeling more comfortable about ourselves," Davey Johnson said. "We're 
getting good pitching and that always makes it a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
With Gooden out, the rotation is Viola, Ron Darling, Sid Fernandez, David Cone 
and Bobby Ojeda. If they're pitching well, no other staff in baseball comes 
close. But until the last two weeks, their potential was just that. Cone, Ojeda 
and Darling combined on consecutive complete-game victories this week, the 
first time three Mets pitchers did that since April 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played well the last three, four months," said Darling, who in his 
last two starts pitched consecutive complete-game victories for the first time 
in his career. "That affects the pitching staff. If you spend every night on 
the bench watching good pitching, you're not going to pick up any bad habits." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hasn't been worrying about bad habits. His problem has been getting 
healthy players. And motivating them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a few problems," he said. "We lost some guys and had to play some 
younger guys." 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief losses was Carter. With his average in the low .100s, he 
brooded and cursed his play. Carter returned in late July from knee surgery and 
in the last week his bat has shown signs of revival. He went 4-for-4 on 
Wednesday against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing him smile instead of coming back shaking his head has been uplifting 
for the team," Davey Johnson said. "I think he's getting healthier all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
And, as Johnson said, the team's mental health also is improving. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants it bad. You can sense it," utility infielder Keith Miller said. 
"Earlier, the team didn't have the right attitude. We weren't hungry. i didn't 
think so." 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds said the Mets are starting to focus on themselves, trying to forget 
about the other teams in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about the Cardinals, the Cubs or the Expos," he said. "We have 
to beat everyone. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mets do win, people will cite the 5-for-1 deal with Minnesota that 
brought Viola back to New York. In two weeks, Viola has made a difference, not 
only on the field, but in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Most times, even after victories, the Mets lockerroom is a somber place, a 
battleground between players and reporters who question their lackluster 
performances. Viola is loosening things up. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's doubleheader sweep of St. Louis, he walked by a row of stalls 
in the clubhouse, took a beer can and threw it down, waiting for it to bounce 
back. Instead, the can broke and sprayed several players. 
</P>
<P>
"That exploded," he said as the wet onlookers laughed. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the NL East has been anxiously awaiting an explosion at Shea 
Stadium all year.

PATRIOTS' ROCK-HARD UNDERTAKER HAS SOFT SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SMITHFIELD, R.I. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Vincent Brown ponders the question, he folds his arms across his chest and 
takes a deep breath. As he does, his shoulder muscles rise like a great 
drawbridge, his chest grows wider than an eight-lane highway and his arms, 
which seem to house most of the world's surplus steel cable, ripple in ungodly 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But the easygoing smile on his face shows that Vincent is not even trying to do 
anything ungodly. He isn't straining or showing off. He's thinking. Imagine how 
he looks when he's flexing. 
</P>
<P>
During the New England Patriots' second-year linebacker's college days at 
Mississippi Valley State, a sports announcer dubbed him "The Undertaker," 
because he didn't so much tackle opponents, he buried them. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots' publicist has already warned you that Brown doesn't like being 
called "The Undertaker," and so you ask him about it and he folds his arms and 
his already huge muscles swell and you wonder if this is where your life will 
end, here in a deserted hallway in the Bryant College gym on a beautiful summer 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Then you see the smile. 
</P>
<P>
"The nickname's been blown out of proportion," Brown said. "But it doesn't 
bother me that much. I don't care what you call me." 
</P>
<P>
Call him Vincent. Talking to him, you can quickly see he's definitely not a 
Vince. "Vince" suggests a wiseacre, a cutup. "Vincent" suggests a 
contemplative, serious person. That's Brown. Despite -- or is it because of? -- 
his forbidding physique, he's probably one of the sweetest guys on the 
Patriots, a soft-poken Atlanta native who speaks in carefully crafted sentences 
and reads and writes poetry in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry is as much an outlet for Brown's frustration as lifting weights is. When 
he missed the first four days of training camp last season while his agent and 
the Patriots were haggling over salary, Brown wrote a poem about his contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Writers love the poetry angle, but Brown is reluctant to discuss his poetry or 
show it around, out of concern, he says, that people might view him as a 
self-promoter, or as someone who doesn't have his priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's priorities are to not make waves and to make the Patriots' starting 
lineup this season. Both seem like good bets. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taught that if you work hard and treat people kindly," Brown said, "good 
things will happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's beliefs were borne out when the Patriots selected him on the second 
round of the 1988 draft, the 44th player chosen overall. He played on special 
teams, started three games at linebacker and saw considerable action in a 
fourth game against the Cincinnati Bengals when Ed Reynolds injured an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
What slowed Brown's progress is what slows that of so many rookie linebackers, 
especially those from smaller schools: reading coverages, being able to go to 
the right spot without having to waste a precious split second thinking about 
where to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected it (the NFL) to be much more physical than it was," Brown said. "I 
didn't expect it to be as tough mentally as it was." 
</P>
<P>
To hasten his adjustment, Brown, a criminal justice major in college who hopes 
to attend law school some day, hung around New England for part of the 
off-season and studied game films two days a week. Still, physically gifted as 
he is, he knows that experience is the only real teacher he needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the coaching staff feels confident with me (in the game), they'll be 
pleased with what I'm able to do," Brown said. "It takes time to develop the 
savvy and know-how the other guys (veterans) have. I'm expecting big things out 
of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Brown is definitely Coach Raymond -- never "Ray" -- Berry's kind of guy. Berry 
calls Brown "one of the finest young men to ever come to this team." 
</P>
<P>
Which is all well and good, but Brown wouldn't have been chosen on the second 
round if that's all he was. What he is is a 6-foot-2, 245-pound sinewy mass who 
could shame most statues into putting on clothes. He has a 20-inch neck and 
wears a custom-made size 54 sports jacket. He can half-squat 800 pounds and 
bench-press 490 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Guys who can bench-press double their weight are almost as hard to find as 
7-footers who can bring the ball upcourt. At minicamp, Brown benched 250 pounds 
26 times. His body fat was measured at 7.8 percent. Leading one to conclude 
that rocks must also have 7.8 percent body fat. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to pumping iron, as with penning poetry, Brown is reluctant to 
extol his feats. He admits to having won a poetry-writing contest in high 
school and being able to heft a lot of weight in the gym, but he does not 
intend to be anyone's sideshow. He intends to be a football player. A good 
one."

4 FRIENDS TRY HOGGING THEIR TIME ON LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
CARLISLE, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a wood-frame, split-level home overlooking the Washington Redskins' 
blocking sleds here, its balcony strewn with beach towels hanging half-dry from 
a clothesline. In five, maybe 10 years, the original Hogs -- Russ Grimm, Joe 
Jacoby, Mark May and Jeff Bostic -- hope to rent the place for a reunion, and 
typically they'll haggle over who brings the beer. 
</P>
<P>
As time drifts into the 1990s, this foursome inevitably will be broken up; it 
could even be next year. "Who knows, I might get hit by a bus?" May said. Few 
realize they already have climbed into their 30s -- May actually doesn't arrive 
there until November -- and if Gerald Riggs fails to revive the team's 
plow-ahead running style, axes surely are to be aimed their way. 
</P>
<P>
"When things go well, they say the quarterback had a great day or the running 
backs were grand," May said. "When it's bad, it's 'Geez, the offensive line 
didn't open holes.' We're used to this." 
</P>
<P>
Grimm, Jacoby, May and Bostic have had parallel setbacks -- Grimm kept needing 
surgery, Jacoby kept missing Lawrence Taylor, May kept getting in fights, 
Bostic kept getting blamed for Jim Burt. Yet they steadily turned "50 Gut" into 
as much of a household phrase as a simple dive play can be. 
</P>
<P>
One day last week these four were telling war stories with former Redskins 
quarterback Billy Kilmer, who always did prefer the company of linemen to the 
flashier types on George Allen's teams of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys would've fit in perfect with the 'Over The Hill Gang' -- play hard 
on the field and off the field," Kilmer said. "George Allen would've loved 'em. 
With George, they'd have 10 more years, in fact." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the game of football has changed dramatically since those days. Not only 
must these Hogs now block 300-pound defensive linemen, they must pitter-pat 
outside and refrain 240-pound linebackers from steamrolling their quarterback. 
So, at age 30, the beer-Gatorade ratio must lean more toward Gatorade, and the 
offseason vacation to Maui must shrink to a week or 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Their guru, offensive-line coach Joe Bugel, constructed a list of do's and 
don'ts this winter, and most of his concern centered on their waistlines. 
"Bostic, we listed as unlimited," Bugel said. "He could gain as much as he 
wanted, though you wouldn't want the guy showing up at 300. Grimm, we wanted at 
275. (Jim) Lachey and May at 295. Jacoby, 305." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Bugel advanced the theory that bigger was better, and diets became a 
foreign word. He decided that the brick-walled New York Giants defense could be 
handled only along a massive offensive line, and Bostic -- always the shrimp -- 
was benched. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Bugel engages in his weight-watcher stage, Bostic said: "I guess it's 
just like clothes. If you wait long enough, they'll come back in style." 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby was thrown for more of a loop than anyone. At last season's end, he was 
admittedly a step or two slow, having lost his left tackle spot to Lachey, and 
his weight -- 347 pounds -- didn't help. His safest strategy would have been to 
maroon himself on an island and munch only on twigs, but instead he nearly 
starved himself and ran 25-30 minutes a day on a treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
He and Grimm adopted a law: If you drank beer on Tuesday, you couldn't eat 
Tuesday. And vice versa. Jacoby, more impressively, restrained himself from his 
ultimate addiction: pizza. 
</P>
<P>
"Since January I've only had three," he said. "Usually it was one a week." 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Bostic said, "pizza's just one of his soft spots -- there's brownies, 
pies, lasagna. ... " 
</P>
<P>
That Jacoby is now 301 pounds soaking wet is of great relevance. It's better 
for his heart and his chronically aching ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"Pizza and spaghetti -- when I wasn't coming over to cook that's all they had," 
said Grimm's wife, Karen, who at the time was Grimm's date. "I'd visit them, 
and there were empty pizza boxes everywhere and a big pot of spaghetti on the 
stove. They'd leave it there for days, and keep reheating it. I said, 'Can't 
you get sick from leaving it out?' They said heating it up killed all the 
germs." 
</P>
<P>
Grimm's mission this winter was to lose 10-15 pounds, to save his creaking 
knees. "I got a wok one day, and he said, 'Why'd you get that?' " Karen Grimm 
said. "I threw sprouts and mushrooms and anything healthy in there, and he 
said, 'I'm not eating rabbit food!' But he liked it. If only he'd try things, 
he'd like it." 
</P>
<P>
As the training camp weigh-in approached, Grimm's weight fluctuated. If he came 
in over 275, he'd be fined $50 a pound per day. "I wasn't going to pay that 
money," Karen said, "so I starved him." 
</P>
<P>
The last couple days before camp, Grimm was hopping on the scale three or four 
times a day; Jacoby meantime would weigh himself following any form of 
exercise: cutting the grass, jogging. One day prior he was two pounds over, so 
he fasted. Yet the Saturday night before Monday's weigh-in was pizza and beer 
night, and Karen ordered: "No pizza, but maybe a beer or two." Sunday he was 
two pounds over, so he ate nothing, ran and sat in the whirlpool. "I came in on 
the money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby and Grimm are two peas in a pod. They've been training-camp roomies 
since the beginning, only now they reside in an Adams Hall suite, as opposed to 
a cluttered, tiny room. "Ah, it has a big table, couch, king-size beds, TV and 
VCR," Grimm said. "We kick back and relax." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Grimm scrimmages here with a baseball cap tucked in the back of his 
football pants -- the latest in sideline fashion. 
</P>
<P>
May is slightly removed from those two, yet he's been Grimm's teammate for 13 
years, back to their days at the University of Pittsburgh. He has had a 
reputation as a dirty player, but he's been steadily healthy and productive, 
and has no weight-pizza hangup. Instead his fetish is his baby girl, Abra 
Lauren, born July 19. One of his closet pals up here used to be a quarterback, 
Joe Theismann, with whom he'd play cards . 
</P>
<P>
"How was it? Prosperous," May said of the card games. "I miss those days. I'll 
always have a soft spot in my heart and part of my house from Joe." 
</P>
<P>
May is the most business-oriented of the four, often sprucing himself up in a 
business suit on his way to a Ford dealership in Virgina. May aspires to have 
his own some day. 
</P>
<P>
Bostic was the only Hog asked to increase his girth, and it shows in his 
midsection. He's a little roly-poly at this stage of training camp, though he 
said he didn't attempt to round himself off so much. "The shortest guy on the 
line is the only one allowed to gain, isn't that crazy?" May asked. "The little 
fat guy gets to gain." 
</P>
<P>
Bugel has admitted, though, that Bostic is now almost irreplaceable on that 
line, a little bulldog who won't shoo away. Together these four are still 
clockwork along the line -- which is why Bugel won't budge them -- and all 
their wives are comfortably close, which ensures Hog barbecues into the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless the future is plain to see as Bugel assembles young linemen like 
26-year-olds Lachey and Raleigh McKenzie (a guard-center), 23-year-olds Mark 
Schlereth and Ralph Tamm (both center-guards) and 27-year-old tackle Ray Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," May said, "we're gonna rent that balcony across the way, crack open 
some cold ones and watch young guys push the sled for Coach Bugel -- a yearly 
reunion." 
</P>
<P>
Bugel snapped: "In five years? No way. They'll still be here."

NEIL DRYSDALE: LIGHT TOUCH AND HEAVY HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two new stars are ready to burst upon the American racing scene. 
</P>
<P>
One is a 4-year-old colt named Rahy, who ran so brilliantly at Hollywood Park 
last month that he may prove to be Easy Goer's main rival in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Neil Drysdale, Rahy's trainer. Drysdale quietly has been compiling 
one of the best records in his profession, and he may be the heir apparent to 
Charles Whittingham as the dominant trainer in the West. Drysdale's 
achievements often go unnoticed because he is a man who shuns the limelight, 
but Rahy might put him there, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale looks like the heir to Whittingham, his former mentor, in more ways 
than one. Whittingham's methods always have been a distinct contrast to those 
of many trainers here, who like to rev up their horses fast and look for fast 
results. Whittingham is legendary for his patience, and he has had his greatest 
successes with late-developing older horses, with foreign imports and with 
distance runners, the types who require farsighted handling. 
</P>
<P>
These are Drysdale's fortes too. He is as patient with his horses as he has 
been with his own development as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale was born in England, the scion of a family involved with steeplechase 
horses and hunters. He wanted to become a trainer, but he thought the 
opportunities would be greater in America than at home, so he came here to 
serve his apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
He worked for two years on a farm in Florida, a year for a trainer in New York 
and then four years under Whittingham. Yet even then Whittingham told Drysdale 
he wasn't ready to go out on his own. Whittingham sent his protege to Ireland 
to work for the great horseman Vincent O'Brien -- "to help round out my 
education," Drysdale said. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he launched his training career, Drysdale has had solid owners 
behind him and has developed a succession of high-class runners. His 
performance has been remarkably consistent. From 1984 through 1988, he won with 
slightly more than 20 percent of the horses he saddled -- an outstanding 
record. Each year his horses earned around $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But this year Drysdale's performance has been phenomenal. He has won with an 
incredible 30 percent of his starters. He ranks fourth in the country in purse 
winnings. He has scored a string of successes with Gorgeous, the second-best 
3-year-old filly in the country. He won the West's biggest race, the $1 million 
Santa Anita Handicap, with the 50-to-1 shot Martial Law. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled off another shocker recently when Prized beat Sunday Silence in the 
$400,000 Swaps stakes. "Neil is outstanding at bringing a horse up to a 
particular race," said Jeff Siegel, manager of the Clover Racing Stable, which 
owned both those long shots. 
</P>
<P>
But no horse demonstrates the Drysdale touch any better than Rahy, a colt who, 
like his trainer, had to cross the Atlantic to fulfill his potential. 
</P>
<P>
Rahy was one of the many high-priced yearlings purchased by Arab sheiks at 
American yearling sales and sent to England. His pedigree couldn't be better: 
he is a son of the top stallion Blushing Groom and the champion mare Glorious 
Song, who had previously produced the brilliant Devil's Bag. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed promise as a 2 year old," Drysdale said, "and they were quite keen 
on him, but he didn't train on at 3" -- i.e., he was a big disappointment. But 
American racing fans know there are plenty of horses who are excellent runners 
on dirt but can't handle turf, and vice versa. Rahy, conceivably, could have 
been one of them. So he was sent to the United States, where he would have a 
chance to run on the dirt. And he has been unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Rahy won a minor allowance race at Golden Gate Fields by six lengths. He ran a 
mile at Hollywood Park, battled head-and-head for the lead in a seemingly 
suicidal 44 seconds flat, but drew away to win by five lengths. And then, in 
the $300,000 Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood, he sat just behind leaders who were 
running a half mile in 44, swooped past them and drew away to win by 10 
lengths. He ran the mile in 1:33 flat over a track that, by California 
standards, was not exceptionally fast. 
</P>
<P>
To speed handicappers, this was an even better performance than Easy Goer's 
celebrated Belmont Stakes triumph. It was an effort that belonged in the 
Seattle Slew-Affirmed-Spectacular Bid class. Rahy still hasn't run beyond a 
mile, but Drysdale thinks he has the pedigree, the temperament and the style to 
be effective at 1 1/4 miles, the distance of the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
What was almost as amazing as the brilliance of Rahy's races was the way 
Drysdale prepared the colt for them. It is an axiom in the West that horses 
must be imbued with speed, and that the way to sharpen them is with fast 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
In his first race at Hollywood, Rahy was facing a speedball named Mi Preferido, 
whose most recent works included a half mile in 46 flat and five furlongs in 57 
4-5. By contrast, Rahy had gone a half mile in a laughably slow 51 2-5, five 
eighths in 1:02 3-5. Yet when the gate opened, Rahy was able to blow Mi 
Preferido off the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost never work horses fast," Drysdale said. "I think when you work horses 
you just try to get them fit and maintain that level of fitness. And once 
they're fit, their natural ability takes over." 
</P>
<P>
To Drysdale, this may sound elementary, but to others it seems a source of 
wonder and mystery that a trainer can work a horse in 51 2-5 then get him to 
run a half mile in competition in 44, effortlessly. Drysdale's skills have 
earned him recognition and admiration in California. Rahy may display his 
talents to a national audience.

TORONTO FARMHAND WAPNICK RAPIDLY PROGRESSING TO DIZZYING HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Considering his reaction thus far to son Steve's rapid ascent through the 
Toronto Blue Jays' organization, perhaps it is best that Abe Wapnick stay away 
from the phone when major league rosters are increased to 40. Should Steve get 
the call, a giddy Abe just might teeter right over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wapnick, the former Monroe High and Moorpark College standout, was 
promoted Monday to Syracuse, the Blue Jays' triple-A affiliate. This just two 
weeks after making the move from Class-A to Knoxville, one of Toronto's 
double-A farm teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling ya," Abe Wapnick yipped, "I can't stand much more of it. It's 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Steve reacted in kind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like I'm in a daze still," he said last week from Cedar Rapids, 
Iowa, where the Chiefs began a weekend series. "I was just getting used to 
Knoxville. I expected double-A, but triple-A I wasn't expecting at all." 
</P>
<P>
Wapnick earned the promotion by giving up only one earned run in 19 innings 
while at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing strikes, getting ahead of people and staying aggressive," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those are three things that endeared him to Knoxville Manager Barry Foote who, 
in turn, relayed the information to Syracuse Manager Bob Bailor, the one-time 
Dodger. Bailor has yet to devise a pitching schedule for the right-hander but 
knows he likes Wapnick's style. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard nothing but good things about him," Bailor said. "He goes after 
hitters, he's real aggressive and that's what you want out of a relief pitcher. 
Personally, I want to get him into a game as soon as possible to get that 
triple-A tension out. I don't want to put him in a position to lose a game and 
mess up his confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Wapnick, indeed, would like to get his shot, but so far he is content just to 
hang out in the bullpen. Watching his first game in a Chiefs uniform, Wapnick 
cozied up to Ozzie Virgil and Sal Butera, two former major leaguers trying to 
work their way back to the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in the bullpen last night and they were talking about how to 
pitch Pedro Guerrero," Wapnick said. "I thought, 'God, I'm only one step away.' 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like 90% of these guys I'm playing with on this team have been in the 
big leagues at some point in their career. I'm just keeping my mouth shut and 
learning. I feel like the greenest guy in the world out here." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the prospect of getting that call to fill out the big-league 
roster in September? 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely on my mind, but I can't dwell on it now," Wapnick said. "Maybe 
this year I can't expect it, because they're in a pennant race and I've only 
been out of A-ball for a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly mental: To look at Travis Kinyoun, the former Royal High catcher playing 
for a Detroit Tiger rookie team in Bristol, Va., nothing has changed. He still 
carries with him the familiar skills of a solid backstop and switch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Kinyoun is batting .267 for Bristol and has three home runs, 26 runs batted in 
and a .467 on-base percentage. He also estimated that he has thrown out 65% of 
would-be base stealers. 
</P>
<P>
Kinyoun, however, insists that there is a difference. He is beginning to think 
like a pro player. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of struggled in high school, hitting-wise," he said. "But I'm a 
different person right now. I can't stop hitting the ball right now. My swing's 
the same, but I've gotten more aggressive at the plate and I'm hitting the ball 
hard from the right and the left." 
</P>
<P>
Under the spring-training tutelage of former Yankee Chris Chambliss, Kinyoun 
developed the necessary mental approach to what some call the most difficult 
task in sport -- hitting a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
That Kinyoun is hitting anything at this point might come as a surprise to 
some. As a sophomore at Royal, Kinyoun, a newly converted catcher, played but 
did not bat -- a designated-hitter was used. By his senior year he had turned 
it around enough to bat .391. 
</P>
<P>
To Shea: Phil Lombardi had made the shuttle before, so the round-trip ticket 
wasn't so disappointing this time. The former Kennedy catcher was purchased 
from Tidewater, the New York Mets' triple-A affiliate in Virginia, on June 28, 
spent nearly a month with the Mets and was sent back. The major league 
assignment coincided with Met catcher Barry Lyons' time nursing a broken toe. 
</P>
<P>
"Going in, I knew it was more of a fill-in thing," said Lombardi, who made 
several trips to the big leagues when he was in the Yankee organization. This, 
however, was his first since being traded to the Mets 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi had been primarily a first baseman at Tidewater when the call came for 
his services -- as a catcher. Lombardi, the City Section Co-Player of the Year 
in 1981, didn't mind in the least. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great because (Mets Manager) Davey Johnson gave me a chance and showed 
confidence in me," he said. "I caught every time a left-hander pitched." 
</P>
<P>
With Lyons and Gary Carter back from injuries, Lombardi has returned to 
Tidewater, still a step away but not dejected. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stick around long enough," said Lombardi, 26, "I'll be playing in the 
seniors league in Florida."

PLAN FOR WATTS FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The July 9 article by Leon Whiteson, "Watts Towers: Symbol of High 
Expectations," was a positive and refreshing view of an otherwise maligned 
Watts community. As members of the Watts Los Angeles/Design Action Planning 
Team (LA/DAPT), we would like to offer some clarifications to Whiteson's 
article. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteson states the plan ". . . has the ambition to transform Watts into one of 
the region's major economic centers by exploiting its location next to the new 
transportation corridors now under construction. The cultural arts complex 
would form the focus of the long-range proposal." 
</P>
<P>
The plan does not say that Watts should become one of the region's major 
economic centers. The plan does say that Watts' changing, ethnically diverse 
residents should have an active role in the plan-making process to decide how 
much, what type and where economic development should occur, just as the people 
of the Westside wish for their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
Major economic development in Watts may provide jobs if there are educational 
and training programs for its under-skilled residents, and if developers are 
directed toward projects which benefit the community. But make no mistake, 
development will also destroy some of the area's proud social relationships, 
cultural heritage and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The plan describes a public participation process which would help residents 
understand the changes and trade-offs, create constituencies, and introduce 
tools and methods of negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the plan is a tool for empowering the people of Watts through 
education, community organization and the arts. Human development is the key to 
developing Watts. The proposed Watts Towers cultural arts complex is one part 
of this puzzle, as are the equally important but gang-torn library, school 
campuses and parks. The "Challenge of Change" recommends improving these and 
other facilities and programs. 
</P>
<P>
Watts has many characteristics of a Third World country. It is a depressed area 
unable to contribute to or benefit from the wealthy First World region 
surrounding it. Oversimplification of this dichotomy, as implied by the 
article, consternates problems and raises false expectations. These problems 
call for new models and methods of planning, which develop understanding and 
shared visions, create wealth equitably and can be implemented. Ultimately, the 
LA/DAPT process must be judged in these terms. The city's Planning Department 
should be supported for moving positively in this direction.

</P>
<P>
 Leon Whiteson replies: The Watts LA/DAPT report states, on Page 31, that the 
ambition of the plan is: "to transform Watts into one of the region's major 
economic centers...." The participation of the community, emphasized in the 
report, was also emphasized in my article.

THE SMALL INVESTOR: HOW TO DETERMINE THE INCOME OF APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We want to buy a small apartment building, perhaps four to six units, 
where we can live in one apartment and rent the others. Last week we almost 
purchased a very attractive building, but we suspected that the expenses shown 
on the broker's statement were too low, so we asked the seller for the utility 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out the agent left off the garbage, water, sewer and electric 
utilities. After we recalculated the seller's figures, it looks like the 
building loses about $225 per month. What is the best way to determine the true 
income of an apartment building? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Congratulations on verifying the utility bills. Another good way to 
determine the true net income of income property is to make your purchase offer 
contingent upon inspecting and approving the seller's Schedule E of the federal 
income tax return. Investment property owners never overstate their income or 
understate their expenses on their income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Best Day of Month to Buy Income Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: I went to one of those "90-minute free real estate seminars" where the 
pitchman told just enough information to get the audience interested in 
attending the weekend realty seminar for $595. I decided not to enroll because 
the pitchman was too slick and I didn't have the money. However, he said there 
is one day of the month which is the best time to buy income property. What day 
is that? 
</P>
<P>
A: The best day to buy income property is the day after rents are collected, 
usually the second day of the month. The reason is the seller then must credit 
the buyer with the full month's rent, minus one day, and the buyer's first 
mortgage payment usually is not due until the following month. After 
considering the security deposits, which must be transferred to the buyer, if 
the timing is right the buyer can often minimize the down payment when the sale 
is closed on the right day of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Make Tax-Deferred Trade for Apartments 
</P>
<P>
Q: If we sell our large old home our profit will be about $150,000. We would 
like to use our profit to buy an apartment building where we could live in the 
manager's apartment and run the building. Is there any way we can avoid paying 
tax on our home sale profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Move out of your home and rent it to tenants, thereby converting it to 
investment or business property. Then it is eligible for an Internal Revenue 
Code 1031 tax-deferred exchange of business or investment property such as 
apartments. Personal residences do not qualify for this preferred tax 
treatment. Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
When a Real Estate Contract Is Assignable 
</P>
<P>
Q: I contracted to buy a small apartment building. As far as the seller is 
concerned, she is to receive all cash. However, I encountered difficulty 
obtaining a mortgage. A friend volunteered to take over the contract because he 
has better financial connections than I do. But the seller refuses to sell to 
my friend. She says the contract is with me and she doesn't have to sell to my 
friend to whom I have assigned the contract. I think she realizes I made a very 
good buy. Can I force her to sell to my friend? 
</P>
<P>
A: The general rule is a contract is assignable unless prohibited by its terms 
or there is a personal service element. 
</P>
<P>
Presuming the contract does not prohibit assignment and your friend's cash is 
as green as your cash, I see no reason why the contract cannot be assigned. 
However, a court might rule differently. But it is up to your friend to decide 
if he wants the property bad enough to get involved in a specific performance 
lawsuit. Ask a real estate attorney to explain further.

WHEN A HOUSE HAS A MAJOR DEFECT; 
</P>
<P>
STATES, REALTY BOARDS CAN HELP HOME BUYERS FACING UNDISCLOSED, HIDDEN PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN L. JAMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young couple moved into their first home, only to discover a false wall in 
the basement foundation hiding crumbling cinder block. Repairing the damage, 
the couple knew, would cost thousands of dollars -- money they didn't have 
after cleaning out their savings accounts for the home purchase. They felt 
certain the seller knew about the basement problem, and possibly the realty 
agent, too. 
</P>
<P>
Given that they'd already closed on the property, do they have any recourse? 
Real estate specialists across the country respond with an emphatic "yes." 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious avenue would be to take the seller to court with a civil suit, 
staking a claim for fraud (though in the young couple's case, the seller had 
moved out of state, leaving no forwarding address). 
</P>
<P>
In addition, if the couple truly believed the realty agent failed to disclose 
his knowledge of the basement defects -- or ought to have known and didn't find 
out -- they could also sue the agent or file a complaint with the real estate 
commissioner in their state. 
</P>
<P>
In many states, such as California, disgruntled buyers, such as the young 
couple, can win monetary damages through state "recovery funds" if they prove 
the real estate agent failed to tell them all he knew about problems with the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyer's Own Tough Luck 
</P>
<P>
Other state commissions go even further -- taking complaints and paying damages 
simply because the realty agent failed to seek out information about problems 
with the property. 
</P>
<P>
The strict notion of "buyer beware" in realty transactions -- that it's the 
buyer's own tough luck if he unknowingly gets stuck with a lemon of a house -- 
is declining quickly. More states are becoming consumer oriented, says James A. 
Edmonds, California's real estate commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he cites a California law, effective since 1987, that requires 
all home sellers to fill out a detailed questionnaire covering defects in their 
property. Potential buyers can review the document before they make up their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
Realty brokers also have disclosure obligations under the new law, including 
the requirement that they carefully inspect a property they have listed. A 
study on the results of the new law is due out in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge, the law has been very effective," Edmonds says. "We don't 
have too many cases where the real estate broker doesn't comply with the 
disclosure requirements. They bend over backwards to protect their liability." 
</P>
<P>
One state whose commission is eager to hear the complaints of disgruntled 
buyers is Maryland. Under Maryland law, says Charles S. Colson, executive 
director of the state's real estate commission, agents are responsible both for 
what they know and should have known about a property. That includes problems 
with any major components of a house -- a leaking roof or basement, a central 
air-conditioning or furnace defect or an electrical or plumbing problem. 
</P>
<P>
If disgruntled Maryland buyers chose to lodge a complaint with the commission 
-- and the investigative unit finds the claim solid -- the matter could go to a 
hearing. Then if the hearing panel finds the agent in the wrong, strong action 
can be taken. The agent could face a reprimand, find his license suspended or 
revoked or confront a heavy monetary penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that through the Maryland commission, a wronged buyer could be 
compensated for the defects -- in the young couple's case for the basement 
problems -- from the state's Real Estate Guaranty Fund. The buyers could 
collect up to $25,000 from the fund, after which the agent would have to 
reimburse the state for its payout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints to Boards 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a lawsuit or a complaint to a state commission, buyers can press 
their claim through a local realtors' board. Realtors are licensed agents who 
-- through their local boards -- are also members of the National Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"It may do the buyers some psychic good if they feel they're bringing the 
realtor to justice," says Chicago-based Robert Butters, deputy general counsel 
for the realtors' national association. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors must abide by certain ethical standards and their boards have 
formalized methods for being sure they do. Assuming that in the young couple's 
case a realtor was involved, the couple could bring a complaint against him 
under Article 9 of the association's code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the code says a realtor shall "avoid misrepresentation or 
concealment of pertinent facts related to the property or the transaction." 
Still, it adds that "the Realtor shall not, however, be obligated to discover 
latent defects in the property." 
</P>
<P>
To activate the realtors' complaint process, your first step is to write a 
letter to the board in the area where the property is located. A grievance 
committee will then investigate your complaint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conscious of Ethics 
</P>
<P>
If the committee believes there is reason to proceed, the matter will go before 
a hearing panel of other realtors. Then, if the panel finds a violation, it has 
a number of options. It can warn or reprimand the realtor, suspend him or expel 
him from the organization, or fine him up to $1,000. However, the complaining 
party has no claim to the fine. 
</P>
<P>
With more customers becoming aggressive in pressing their complaints, agents 
are becoming more conscious of their ethics, according to Gerald Matthews, 
executive vice president of the Florida Assn. of Realtors. "Realtors are very 
careful to do things exactly as they should to avoid lawsuits," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For the young couple with the basement problem, a basic method of recourse is 
obviously to sue the seller, though "these are tough cases," cautions Douglas 
M. Bregman, a real estate attorney in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to settled properties, it's of no help legally under most state 
laws to show that the seller broke the sales contract, because the contract is 
effectively dissolved at the settlement table, Bregman says. Instead, the buyer 
has to prove actual fraud on the sellers' part. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formidable Defense 
</P>
<P>
The young couple, for instance, must show that the seller knowingly deceived 
them by erecting the false wall to conceal the faulty foundation and then 
deliberately failed to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
But even in so seemingly blatant a case as that, the seller can mount 
formidable defenses -- for instance, that he bought the house after the false 
wall was put up or that he hired a contractor who he believed fixed the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Even though such cases are tough to win in court, Bregman says that buyers can 
often be effective in winning out-of-court settlements. And he says you 
shouldn't be discouraged that a seller has moved out of town. All the buyer 
needs to do is obtain a forwarding address. Keep in mind, however, that it's 
far easier for a home buyer to press his claim before settlement than after. In 
virtually all cases, buyers should consider making their sales contracts 
contingent on completion of a bona fide home inspection. That way, many defects 
will become apparent before the property is settled, allowing the buyer to 
demand changes or renegotiate price before the deal has gelled. 
</P>
<P>
Because an increasing number of sellers are being sued these days, Bregman 
believes an inspection is also in the seller's interest, since it shows he 
willingly opened his property to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Says Bregman: "Whether I'm representing the seller or buyer, I always push for 
a thorough inspection by a reputable inspector because that gets everybody off 
the hook."

CONSTRUCTION UNDER WAY ON GETTY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction has started on the first phase of the $300-million J. Paul Getty 
Center northwest of the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and the San Diego 
(405) Freeway in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the architectural firm of Richard Meier &amp; Partners, the art 
complex will occupy a 24-acre hilltop within a 110-acre site in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Dinwiddie Construction Co., Los Angeles, has been appointed 
general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, scheduled for completion in 1991, includes a 
six-level, 1,200-acre underground parking structure at the public entrance to 
the center at Sepulveda Boulevard and Getty Center Drive, according to Stephen 
D. Rountree, director of the Getty Trust Building Program. The entire project 
is targeted for a 1995 completion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty Center is being designed as a campus-like complex that will unite the 
J. Paul Getty Trust's Los Angeles-based programs and provide specialized 
facilities for their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Main structures will include a second facility for the J. Paul Getty Museum, 
with about 60,000 square feet of gallery space; the Getty Center for the 
History of Art and the Humanities; and facilities for the Getty Conservation 
Institute, the Getty Center for Education in the Arts, and the Getty Trust 
administrative offices. There will also be a 450-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the construction team include Robert Englekirk Consulting Structural 
Engineers Inc., Los Angeles; John L. Altieri Consulting Engineers, Norwalk, 
Conn.; B&amp;E Engineers of Los Angeles, and Woodward-Clyde Consultants of 
Santa Ana. Emmet L. Wemple &amp; Associates is the landscape architect.

The high court in the Maldives sentenced a Sri Lanka-based Maldivian 
businessman to death for leading a failed coup in the Indian Ocean archipelago, 
the Maldivian government announced. Seventy-five people, including 68 Sri 
Lankan Tamil mercenaries, were convicted of participating in the Nov. 3, 1988 
coup attempt. Sixteen people -- four Maldivians and 12 Sri Lankans -- were 
given death sentences. The others received prison terms ranging from nine to 38 
years. The court found businessman Abdullah Luthufi guilty of organizing the 
attempt to overthrow President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The attempt was crushed by 
Indian paratroopers after Gayoom requested help.

Polish Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak called for a meeting with Solidarity leader 
Lech Walesa to discuss the stalemate in Kiszczak's efforts to name a Cabinet 
and the concerns it has raised in the Soviet Union. In an interview published 
by the official PAP news agency, Kiszczak said Poland "simply cannot afford a 
protracted impasse." He also called on two Communist-aligned political parties 
that have begun negotiations with the Solidarity movement to remain loyal to 
the Communist Party. Walesa has been trying to forge alliances with the two 
minor parties, who hold the parliamentary balance of power, in order to form a 
Solidarity-led government.

A rupture in a natural gas pipeline forced a brief evacuation of several 
hundred people from seven high-rise buildings in San Francisco's downtown 
financial district, police said. A worker digging a trench apparently struck a 
16-inch gas line on California Street between Sansome and Battery streets, said 
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman Ron Rutkowski. About 70 guests were 
evacuated from the Mandarin Oriental San Francisco Hotel at about 8:30 p.m. but

Striking ethnic Russian workers in the Soviet Baltic republic of Estonia 
pledged to continue their protest action against a new local voting law that 
disenfranchises recent immigrants, many of whom are Russians. Izvestia, the 
Soviet government newspaper, said that 40,000 workers are on strike. A 
spokesman for the Estonian Popular Front movement, set up last year to promote 
autonomy and democratic reform, told Reuters news agency in Moscow by telephone 
from the capital, Tallinn, that there was no sign of any disruption in the 
city. However, Vladimir Vinogradov, a spokesman for the Russian group 
Interdvizhenie, organized as a counter to the Popular Front, said the strike 
against the new election law will continue.

Oakland Coliseum officials are enraged about reports of a party in the 
stadium's sky-box seating area attended by off-duty Hayward police officers. As 
many as 20 officers attended the private party in late April, drinking liquor 
and watching a live striptease show. The officers had received free tickets 
from a Hayward auto dealer, said Oakland police officials, who are now 
investigating whether acceptance of the tickets constituted a violation of 
police ethics. Coliseum operators said they are concerned that the party might 
have put them in violation of state alcoholic beverage laws forbidding the 
mixing of nudity and alcohol in public places.

Indian troops in Sri Lanka killed at least 51 civilians after being attacked by 
Tamil rebels in a northern town, Tamil sources said. They said 40 houses and 23 
shops were set afire by the soldiers after an Indian patrol was ambushed Aug. 2 
in Velvettiturai, 200 miles north of Colombo. At least six Indian soldiers were 
killed in the attack, military officials said at the time. In New Delhi, a 
government spokesman said there were 18 civilian casualties in an exchange of 
gunfire after the ambush. He said the rebels used civilians as cover while 
firing at the Indian patrol.

A California man who had been working in Vietnam said he was briefly detained 
in manacles and denied access to diplomats before being deported. Daniel 
Robinson, 25, of San Rafael, a student at Princeton University, said he was in 
Vietnam for the past 10 weeks to research a travel guidebook under a contract 
with an Australian firm. He said the visit was authorized and assisted by Hanoi 
and that he had a valid visa. But he said he was questioned three times over 
three days, told he had to leave because he lacked necessary documentation and 
put on a flight to Bangkok.

13 DIE AS BALLOON CRASHES

Thirteen people were killed in a hot-air balloon accident in central Australia, 
police said. The balloon crashed in a desert area about 10 miles south of the 
Alice Springs airport. Police, who said all aboard the balloon were killed, had 
not yet determined the cause of the accident, and it was not immediately known 
how high the balloon was flying before the accident. The Australian Associated 
Press said the balloon often carried a dozen tourists at a time on rides. It 
was the second fatal hot-air balloon accident in nine days. Another occurred in 
Baton Rouge, La., on Aug. 5, when a balloon deflated at 3,000 feet during a 
national competition and crashed, killing the pilot. Investigators there said 
the balloon was leaking before takeoff.

CONTINUES ANTI-DRUG FIGHT, IS WRITING A BOOK;

NANCY REAGAN JUST SAYS NO TO IDLENESS 
</P>

<P>
In the day room of a drug recovery center in Pacoima -- Pacoima -- Nancy Reagan 
sat well forward on the seat of the least worn of five brown vinyl sofas. 
</P>
<P>
That intent, doe-eyed gaze that had variously annoyed or enchanted onlookers 
through 20 years of political campaigns seemed unfeigned here, for these were 
bona fide horrors she was hearing from the 26 women: I started getting high on 
PAM cooking spray as a kid. . . . I tried to kill my little sister by luring 
her into a pit of broken glass. . . . I swiped my father's bottle of 
Thunderbird and chugged it down. . . . I watched my mother spoon dope into 
balloons to sell. . . . I have six children, three of them drug babies. 
</P>
<P>
"Six!" interrupted Mrs. Reagan, her gaze suddenly wider yet. "Six?" 
</P>
<P>
She had shaken their hands when she arrived at Via Avanta House -- "Oh, how 
cute!" one of them had gasped at the sight of her -- and she told them "how 
proud I am of all of you." 
</P>
<P>
When they had finished their searing stories, it was her turn to speak, and 
they clung to her with their eyes as she did: 
</P>
<P>
"We all go through painful times . . . you have to learn that's part of life. 
Life was never meant to be level, one happy level all the time. God never meant 
it to be that way. There are testing periods. It's not just us -- we're not 
being picked out and tested. Granted, you've all had more than your share; some 
people do, for one reason or another. But you can get out of it and you're 
taking the first step. . . . I don't care what your station in life is, you go 
through some difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan, former First Lady, anti-drug crusader, author of her upcoming 
memoirs, center of a worshipful and wealthy circle of old friends, was 
addressing her remarks to a circle of recovering drug users, women isolated by 
poverty, burdened by too many children and too little education -- a crummy 
poker hand in which PCP or crack or speed looked like the one card that could 
make everything bearable, then wound up being one joker too many. 
</P>
<P>
Listen on a different plane, though, and she might have been speaking about 
herself as well. For Nancy Reagan, back in a private and privileged life after 
spending eight years on the laboratory slide of the presidency, has her own 
"painful times" to remember. Surely there were moments in the last eight years 
when she was convinced that she too was being "picked out and tested" -- when 
her husband was nearly assassinated; when her mother and adoptive father died; 
when she and her husband both battled cancer; when the Iran-Contra scandal 
threatened Reagan's presidency; when her lavish, borrowed designer clothes, her 
absorption in astrology, her imperious style, all fed the mills of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She's a Western Girl' 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you she is much happier here than in Washington," said Stuart 
Spencer, the veteran Reagan campaign strategist. "Washington is a different 
town . . . a very 'in' town, a company town, and she's a Western girl." 
</P>
<P>
On the 68-year-old Mrs. Reagan's retirement calendar, besides lunches and 
dinners with her intimates: 
</P>
<P>
* A November book tour that will take her from Detroit to Dallas, California to 
New York; 
</P>
<P>
* Speaking engagements lined up for her at $30,000 each through a Washington 
agency; 
</P>
<P>
* Videotaping breast cancer public service messages for the American Cancer 
Society; 
</P>
<P>
* A trip to Japan with her husband in October, 
</P>
<P>
* And on almost every page of her datebook, some event or program to bang the 
gong for her anti-drug crusade. 
</P>
<P>
It is the raison d'etre for the Nancy Reagan Foundation office, sharing the top 
floor of a Century City building with her husband. She has taped anti-drug 
radio and video spots, starred at young people's anti-drug rallies at Dodger 
Stadium and the Rose Bowl and in Chicago with actor "Mr. T," she startled some 
Reagan loyalists by calling for a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles as "tools 
of the drug trade," and in April, she tagged along behind police on a raid of a 
rock house that was so thoroughly media-mobbed that it was a surprise that 
anyone was still on the premises to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a white-gloves dainty approach," Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
No one expected her to be an ex-First Lady of the Rosalynn Carter mold, 
building homes for the poor. But of the varied crises that plague society -- 
poverty, racism -- drugs is the one that has become personal for her. Drugs has 
leaped the social ladder to reach every rung, into the lives of people she 
knows, killing movie stars' children and welfare mothers' children alike. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs "was the greatest fear of all of us who were mothers in California in the 
1960s," said Nancy Reynolds, a longtime friend and now a Washington political 
consultant. "I'm sure she had plenty of friends whose children were deeply 
involved in drugs -- everybody did. We all knew people whose kids died of it. 
We were always scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
On her First Lady drug tours, "people began to tell her things about their 
children they wouldn't tell anyone else, children talked to her -- that touched 
her. That really gave a purpose to her, to being a First Lady." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned Layman 
</P>
<P>
Her questions on those tours have been a concerned layman's, not an expert's: 
"Who got you started on drugs? You started right away on cocaine? Usually I've 
found most people start on pot. . . . Do you think the main factor for anyone 
going into drugs is the self-esteem?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Reagan is not a treatment counselor," said Reagan spokesman Weinberg. 
"She can lend a hopeful presence, if you will, to those who have been afflicted 
by this plague. That's the greatest talent she has." 
</P>
<P>
A California political consultant who works with other Republican candidates 
characterizes Mrs. Reagan as "an ambitious, driven, semi-politician in her own 
right," and "a hard person for people to love. She is always two notches above 
the average person. Her husband was only one notch above. . . . Rather than 
being a First Lady people tended to love or feel warm about, she was a First 
Lady people felt would go to any lengths to help her husband. . . . You 
wouldn't want to cross her path." 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to the drug crusade, "Just because she has a steeliness in 
her doesn't mean she's not altruistic. I think she really wants to contribute 
something to society in that way. I don't doubt her motivation in that way 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
There have been moments, though, when good intentions and the logistics to 
accomplish them seemed to be pulling in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Launched With Grandeur 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raising campaign for the center that was to bear Nancy Reagan's name, 
operated under the aegis of the nationally regarded nonprofit drug-abuse agency 
Phoenix House Inc., was launched with all the grandeur of a great ship. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be a formidable project, renovating an abandoned medical center, 
establishing live-in treatment, after-school programs, research and training, 
and offices for Mrs. Reagan. In 1988, Merv Griffin put together a big-bucks, 
big-name fund-raising breakfast at his home. Griffin was also the host when the 
Reagans came to town last January for a $1,000-a-ticket Beverly Hilton benefit 
dinner ornamented by caviar, blue-corn blinis and Don Rickles' jokes. By 
mid-1989 the Nancy Reagan Center had very deep pockets indeed -- more than $2 
million, and at least another $2.5 million in pledges toward the estimated 
$10-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her friends signed onto the Center's advisory committees, among them 
Mike Wallace, with whom she has taped a lengthy "60 Minutes" interview about 
her upcoming book. The rich and famous are still clamoring to help, to have 
Nancy Reagan grace their premises, said Suzanne Marx, national campaign 
chairman of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have 3 million worth of offers sitting here -- Tiffany's, Cartier, Van 
Cleef -- everybody, everybody's been touched by drug abuse," Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nancy Reagan Center stumbled coming out of the chute. At last January's 
gala, it was the 17 pickets outside the hotel, not the movers and shakers 
inside, who would have the last word. Residents of Lake View Terrace, the site 
that had been chosen, were wrathful in their opposition. In May, Mrs. Reagan 
withdrew her support for that plan for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan, asked about it last month, seemed to pronounce the matter a dead 
issue, and her relationship with Phoenix House all but severed. The Lake View 
Terrace plan is "over, finished," she said. "The last thing I wanted is to 
upset the community, that was not my aim, so I will continue my drug interest 
and activities and I'll do it through (the Nancy Reagan) Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House is still "looking for another site," not having "received any 
communication from Nancy Reagan's people or Nancy Reagan herself to stop 
looking," said Phoenix House spokesman Chris Policano. 
</P>
<P>
With millions legally earmarked for a Nancy Reagan Center, Phoenix House has 
written to donors about the quandary, but clearly does not want to relinquish 
the donations, or thereby the Nancy Reagan Center that brought them in. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is figuring out how this can all be handled," said Phoenix 
House vice president for development Sara Ann Fagin. "This is (an) extremely 
complicated situation under philanthropic law; they've all taken tax deductions 
in the previous year for this already. This is a very complicated situation. 
We're working it out with a whole lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan is putting her efforts into her own foundation. As of this week, it 
is authorized to raise funds in Los Angeles, and executive director John 
Gustafson said a charity tennis tournament in October tops the event list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grant Applications 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has some money already, an amount Gustafson will not disclose, 
and has sent letters asking various drug education and treatment programs in 
the area to apply for varying matching grants: for example, $5,000 if a group 
raises $25,000, Gustafson said. The Nancy Reagan cachet makes every dollar bulk 
even larger. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Mrs. Reagan accompanied Los Angeles police on a rock-house raid, 
eating fruit salad in a nearby motor home while waiting to go onto the 
premises. Some neighbors cheered her, a few grumped in the background. Some 
mothers afterwards called it "a dog and pony show." "We feel we're being 
exploited," one said. "There are more constructive ways to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Her highest profile remains the "Just Say No" mantra, which she uttered "not 
thinking this was going to be like a household word, but it did and I'm glad it 
did." 
</P>
<P>
It still brings in letters. One touching, ill-spelled note came last month from 
a 15-year-old boy being treated in Arkansas. "I can't say that the 'just say 
know' champain helped me directly because I didn't go to treatment by my own 
will," he wrote. "The 'just say no' champain did help me indirectly and in that 
way I'm greatful. My mom saw some comercals and posters. She took a look at my 
drug abuse and put me into treatment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Say No Group 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan remains honorary chair of the nonprofit Just Say No group, based in 
Walnut Creek, Calif. Executive Director Ivy G. Cohen said the clubs, for 7- to 
14-year-olds, now number 15,000 in the United States, in housing projects and 
prosperous suburbs, with a few dozen internationally, and more chartered every 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Each club receives a packet of handbooks and guides to foster "good values, 
friendships, so they develop social circles of positive (peer) pressure," Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also markets accessories, from club start-up kits for $50 to a 
baseball cap for $3.75. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Help to Addicts 
</P>
<P>
Just Say No has been faulted by some drug experts for offering a fine upbeat 
message for young children but hardly being of help to a crack addict. 
</P>
<P>
Controversial research last year concluded that while drugs did indeed ravage 
the lives of heavy users, those who used less had fewer troubles, and those who 
had only experimented briefly showed, like non-users, no appreciable impact at 
all. That flew in the face of the "even one is too many" premise and the Just 
Say No message of abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
Against that, some researchers felt that the First Lady's campaign had 
sloganeered and politicized a complex psychomedical social crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Karst Besteman is executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Problems Assn., 
and from 1974 to 1980 was deputy director of the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse. While he praises Mrs. Reagan for bringing drug abuse to public 
attention, he is equally vigorous in noting its shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"Her being willing to stand up as First Lady and say, 'This is the way it 
should be,' it put a little backbone into the suburban middle class to say 
'Hey, I won't put up with this.' " Nonetheless, "an abstinence campaign like 
Just Say No has a very narrow band of effectiveness, in terms of demographics 
and age." Counseling addicted mothers or crack users requires techniques 
"vastly different from how I talk to fourth graders." 
</P>
<P>
He faults the Reagan Administration, not its First Lady, for being slow off the 
mark. Officials "used her as a shield" for years to substitute for a real drug 
policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd said to me, 'Is this good federal policy?' I'd have said, 'No, it's 
inadequate.' If you said to me, 'As a private issue for a First Lady, did she 
do a good job of highlighting drug abuse?' I'd say she did a good job, but 
that's a totally different criterion." 
</P>
<P>
Nonwithstanding a leap in the use of crack cocaine, the reported decrease in 
other drug use bespeaks a turnabout of public attitudes, and Reynolds is not 
alone in declaring that Mrs. Reagan "certainly deserves some credit for making 
people aware of the horror of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan herself takes something of a bow, as at Via Avanta: "When I first 
started almost nine years ago, nobody knew anything about drugs, nobody knew 
there was a problem, admitted there was a drug problem. . . . I can't tell you 
the difference between this and 8 1/2 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
She and her staff may have listened to criticism of Just Say No, and begun 
focusing their message where it will do the most good -- children who have yet 
to use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At Via Avanta, Mrs. Reagan told the women: "Now I am encouraged by the young 
people. I get very cross at the older people who should know better." She 
warmly praised their struggle to free themselves of drugs, then almost as an 
aside noted a cold fact of demographics: as "the (drug-free) young people get 
older, they'll push out the older ones." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Class Photo' 
</P>
<P>
She circled the room, hugging each woman, then called gaily, "Let's do a class 
photo!" 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a 20-year-old former cocaine user with three children couldn't get 
over it: "I've watched her make history for eight years and everything and it's 
like wow, here she comes, interested in our program." 
</P>
<P>
The woman whose six children had so astonished Mrs. Reagan still stood in the 
day room, her face still aglow from the contact. "She's a miracle to me." 
</P>
<P>
Outside Via Avanta, against a backdrop that could have been chosen by the 
Reagan White House for visuals that said "struggling neighborhood" -- blue 
trash dumpsters, cinder-block walls, the racket of a freeway -- Mrs. Reagan 
answered questions. What does she bring to those women inside? She paused for a 
fraction of a moment: "Hope, I think -- I hope. And that somebody's interested 
in them and has been for quite a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Air conditioning rumbling, the Secret Service's ink-blue Lincoln was waiting in 
the parking place that had earlier been reserved by two lengths of gift-wrap 
ribbon, pink and red, taped up between two plastic chairs. Mrs. Reagan climbed 
in, waved, and was off.

SHELLS RAIN ON BEIRUT FOR 3RD DAY;

BOMBARDMENT IS WORST IN 5 MONTHS IN LEBANON CAPITAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a break of only two hours, the heaviest sustained shelling in the 
five-month battle of Beirut thundered with the dawn Saturday, obscuring the 
city in a shroud of smoke at the start of another day of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight day, Syrian and Christian artillerymen trained their 
guns across nearly half of Lebanon but poured the brunt of their fire on the 
ruined, near-lifeless capital and its suburbs. By Saturday night, police 
reports said 22 people had been killed and more than 110 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the French and Argentine embassies were hit by Syrian rockets, and 
one French Embassy guard was slightly wounded, security sources said. The U.S. 
and Brazilian embassies were also reported hit, according to Reuters news 
agency. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
At nightfall, an orphanage in West Beirut was hit by shellfire from Christian 
forces, and three children were hospitalized in critical condition, according 
to the Muslim-run Voice of the People radio station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomats' Houses Under Fire 
</P>
<P>
In overnight shelling, the residences of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and 
French Ambassador Rene Ala in suburban Yarze came under fire, the second time 
in 48 hours. No one was reported injured at either location. 
</P>
<P>
The summer-dry hills south of the city were afire, according to reports 
reaching Cyprus, 90 miles offshore. Christian gunners searching for Syrian 
battery emplacements had shelled the hills and villages with rockets and cannon 
fire, turning the brush to flames. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the Syrians showered the Christian bastion of East 
Beirut and the mountains beyond with volleys of rocket fire at 6 a.m. Saturday, 
ending a two-hour lull in the overnight shelling. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian rockets were answered by the heavy artillery of the predominantly 
Christian Lebanese army, commanded by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. Shells from Aoun's 
American-made 155-millimeter howitzers fell on suspected Syrian gun positions. 
</P>
<P>
Shells and rockets rained down on some areas at the rate of 60 per minute, 
security sources said Saturday. On Thursday and Friday, residents had said 
rockets were falling at the rate of 40 a minute. At least 62 people have been 
killed and nearly 400 wounded over the three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
At Khalde, south of Beirut, the incoming shells sent Syrian soldiers manning a 
checkpoint diving into roadside trenches. Some motorists hid under a highway 
bridge, according to press accounts. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris on Saturday, President Francois Mitterrand launched an international 
peace initiative to end the artillery duels, asking Foreign Minister Roland 
Dumas to send envoys to the Syrian capital of Damascus, Moscow, Washington and 
the United Nations to try to end the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
"The president has asked the government to do all it can to once again alert 
the international community and interested countries to the Lebanese problem," 
the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will also consult members of the three-nation mission sent by the 
Arab League to find a solution to the conflict, it added. 
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued July 31, a league committee -- made up of King Fahd of 
Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid 
-- declared it had reached an impasse, saying specifically that its proposals 
for peace in Lebanon were turned down by the Syrian government of Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Syria on Saturday vowed to step up its fight against Aoun, saying his 
rule threatens the security of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"The conspiracy implemented by Aoun is clear," said the official Tishreen 
daily. "The Arab responsibility requires intensifying efforts to prevent its 
escalation because it does not only threaten Lebanon's security but that of the 
Arab world." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Aoun on Saturday called for sanctions to be imposed on the 
Damascus government. 
</P>
<P>
"We call on the international community, especially the five permanent members 
of the United Nations, to impose a political and economic boycott on the Syrian 
regime, which has proved to be Nazi and barbaric," Aoun said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In West Beirut, Sunni Muslim Premier Salim Hoss, who is backed by Syria, issued 
a statement reflecting the despair of many Beirut residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not be exaggerating when we say that for the first time since the war 
broke out, we feel we are left blowing in the wind with no ceilings above our 
heads," said Hoss, who heads a Muslim Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's 
Christian military Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The all-out artillery exchanges began Thursday afternoon, continued for 15 
hours without letup and then eased for nine hours before resuming in Friday's 
13-hour siege. On Friday, Christian shells fell on the eastern, 
Syrian-controlled city of Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of Beirut, enlarging the 
circumference of the artillery war. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 people were reported killed in shelling Thursday and Friday, 
pushing the death toll over the past five months to nearly 600. The city has 
been largely evacuated. The estimated 200,000 residents who remain in Beirut 
leave their homes and shelters only for food and water. Electricity is 
available no more than an hour a day, and often in the past week not at all. 
Telephone connections to Cyprus have been out for days. 
</P>
<P>
Only the artillerymen are at work -- and those who clean up the damage they 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Nations are not built on shelling and destruction and the killing of men, 
women, children and old people," Sheik Mohammed Kabbani, the leader of 
Lebanon's Sunni Muslims, declared Friday, imploring both sides to silence their 
guns. "Where are the country's wise men to stop this tragedy, this mass murder, 
this blood bath?" 
</P>
<P>
Kabbani's predecessor as Sunni grand mufti, Sheik Hassan Khaled, was 
assassinated in a car bombing in West Beirut last March, just as the artillery 
war began. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Friday, the State Department issued another appeal for a 
cease-fire, again initially unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people and 
the renewed use of heavy-caliber weapons," said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. 
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met with the five permanent 
Security Council members on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
During the Beirut hostage crisis that has gripped the outside world, the 
Syrian-Christian shelling eased. However, nearly two weeks ago, just three days 
into the crisis, the Arab League effort to halt the Beirut fighting broke down. 
</P>
<P>
With the political initiative in collapse, diplomatic and press accounts from 
Beirut reported both sides moving up heavy arms. Syrian troop and truck 
movements were spotted in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Reinforcements on both 
sides were noted at Souq el Gharb, a bloodied ridgeline village southeast of 
Beirut where Christian and Muslim forces have faced off for years. 
</P>
<P>
Several Beirut newspapers reported that the Syrians were placing tanks and 
heavy guns along the Green Line that separates the Muslim west and Christian 
east sectors of the capital. Throughout the more than 14 years of the sectarian 
Lebanese civil war, weapons along the dividing line have fallen in the category 
of small arms -- rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. 
</P>
<P>
The developments of the past week seemed to signal that in the absence of a 
political settlement, the Syrian forces were preparing a direct land assault on 
the Christian enclave. That has not happened yet, but politicians are clearly 
discouraged by the vacuum left by the abandonment of the Arab League effort. 
</P>
<P>
The field has been left to the military men. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun has predicted that a "river of resistance" will rise in Lebanon's cities 
and villages against the 40,000-member Syrian army that controls two-thirds of 
the country. The determined, tough-talking artillery general, head of the 
Christian side of Lebanon's divided government, triggered the fighting in March 
when his forces blockaded Muslim militia ports. The Syrians blockaded Christian 
ports in return. When the shelling began, Aoun declared a "war of liberation" 
against the Syrians, who first entered Lebanon in 1976 as Arab League 
peacekeepers at the outset of the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Walid Jumblatt, head of the militant Druze forces in Lebanon and a firm ally of 
Syria's Assad, foresaw the worst for Beirut. "Beirut will be another Stalingrad 
and its future is very dark," the Druze leader told an Arab reporter last week. 
"Beirut will be demolished and leveled to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler had specifically mentioned 
as "particularly destructive" the Syrians' Soviet-made 240-millimeter mortar, 
which fires a massive round. Last week one fell on an underground shelter in 
East Beirut, collapsing it and killing 11 occupants. Several of the giant 
mortar rounds have fallen on the grounds of Aoun's presidential palace in the 
past three days. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon is more frightening than the rockets used by both sides. Fired from a 
truck-mounted launcher of 40 tubes -- a modern version of the old Soviet 
"Stalin Organ" -- the rockets stream toward their targets like huge handfuls of 
explosive darts. 
</P>
<P>
Describing a recent rocket exchange over West Beirut, a young secretary told a 
British reporter: "When they began shooting at each other with these rockets -- 
40 on each side -- it was like an earthquake. My back started vibrating. Shells 
were colliding in the air."

FOCUS TURNS TO ENGINE DESIGN FOR AIR SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL and PAUL HOUSTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jumbo jet had just lifted off when a flight deck indicator warned the crew 
that one of its three engines -- No. 2, in the tail -- was vibrating 
excessively. As soon as it was safe to do so, the crew eased back the throttle 
for that engine and watched the indicator. It returned to normal and stayed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Everything was normal. The no-smoking light was turned off, and flight 
attendants prepared to serve drinks to 203 passengers settling back for the 
four-hour trip. 
</P>
<P>
But back in the tail, deep in the superheated recesses of that 7,000-pound No. 
2 jet engine, a series of breakdowns was occurring beyond the view of 
passengers, crew or even cockpit indicators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hurled Like Shrapnel 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the engine exploded. Nuts, bolts and turbine blades were hurled like 
shrapnel. Metal fragments punctured the back wall of the passenger cabin and 
one of the lavatories. The aft fuselage was blown open, disabling rudder pedal 
cables, electric wiring, some fuel lines and three hydraulic systems serving 
the tail wings, the movable horizontal stabilizers. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, this Eastern Airlines jet -- a Lockheed L-1011 with Rolls-Royce 
engines -- still had an operating, though damaged, fourth hydraulic system. The 
crew was able to bring the giant plane back to a safe landing at New York's 
Kennedy International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
That was Sept. 22, 1981. It was not the first time, or the last, that an engine 
explosion damaged a jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, over the past 20 years an average of about 25 engine explosions -- or, 
what the industry calls "uncontained engine failures" -- have occurred 
annually. More than 10% of those incidents caused significant damage to the 
structure of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But before July 19, when 111 died after an engine explosion crippled United 
Airlines Flight 232 over Iowa, industry leaders confident of redundant 
safeguards thought the odds of such a catastrophic failure were as low as 10 
billion to 1. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly a public issue. Rarely had debate over engine containment 
problems risen beyond the obscure seminars and research papers of aeronautical 
scholars and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Even there, however, there were voices of warning. More than 10 years ago, 
Gordon L. Gunstone of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority urged industry 
officials to work on design changes because, he said, jet engine explosions 
"happen too frequently for comfort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improved Designs Urged 
</P>
<P>
He said that since it is unrealistic to expect engines to operate flawlessly at 
all times, "the only valid solution" is for manufacturers to improve aircraft 
designs to make them increasingly invulnerable to crippling damage from what he 
called "this endemic disease" of engine bursts. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the loss of an engine that worried experts like Gunstone. Jets are 
designed to fly safely after losing an engine. But engine debris can punch 
holes in the passenger cabin, rupture fuel tanks and damage various control 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
And Flight 232, for example, lost all three of its hydraulic lines, rendering 
useless the plane's control system of flaps, slats and rudder. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as safety investigators continue to search for the cause of that engine 
explosion, the industry is preparing for a more sweeping re-evaluation of 
protective designs. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear at this time that some action is appropriate," Dale Warren, a 
McDonnell Douglas vice president, acknowledged days after the crash. He said 
engineers were studying various design changes that could include shields for 
vital systems or better methods for containing engine debris within the 
cowling. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Federal Aviation Administration chief James B. Busey formed a 
government-industry task force to investigate possible design changes. 
Ironically, the first day the task force met last week, the engine of a 
Northwest Airlines DC-10 blew up, forcing a safe emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
All of this design attention comes at an important time in the development of 
the next generation of jumbo jetliners. The MD-11, a bigger and longer-range 
version of the DC-10, is being developed at McDonnell Douglas and will be 
subject to FAA certification evaluation over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question the work of the task force will impact the certification 
process," said FAA spokesman Dave Duff. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials acknowledge that not only will the MD-11 have essentially the 
same hydraulic system that was wiped out by the engine blast on the United 
DC-10, but the new jumbo jet is designed to carry 2,000 gallons of jet fuel in 
the same horizontal stabilizer that was riddled with engine fragments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd want to look at that very, very closely," said one aerospace safety 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas dismissed concern about the aft fuel tank, 
however, noting that all jumbo jets have fuel tanks in their wings, in close 
proximity to wing-mounted engines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire Would Be Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
"It's no more dangerous to have that fuel tank in back than to have it in the 
wing," said Don Hanson of McDonnell Douglas. And he said that at cruising 
altitudes, where the United engine explosion occurred, for example, a fire 
would be extremely unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"About all you'd get is a leak if a fragment went through that tank," Hanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire is of greater concern near the ground, however, and statistics compiled by 
U.S. and British aviation agencies show that nearly 90% of the engine 
explosions occur when the engines are under maximum stress -- during takeoff 
and climb. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a wing-mounted Pratt &amp; Whitney engine on a British-operated Boeing 
737 exploded on takeoff from Manchester, England, igniting the fuel tanks and 
killing more than 50 passengers. And in 1975, an Overseas National Airways 
DC-10 taking off at Kennedy Airport erupted in flames after a flock of birds 
was sucked into a wing engine. The engine exploded and dropped from the wing, 
rupturing fuel lines. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial jet engines are wrapped in protective nacelle cowlings designed to 
help prevent foreign objects from striking the engine and to contain engine 
parts if they break off. 
</P>
<P>
The General Electric CF6-6 engine that exploded on Flight 232 is typical of 
jumbo jet engines. Its perfectly balanced rotor assembly acts like a giant 
propeller -- its 38 blades, each three feet long and weighing about 10 pounds, 
mounted around a 300-pound titanium disc, spin at 3,800 revolutions per minute. 
It sucks air into a series of compressor and combustion chambers, where it is 
burned with jet fuel and the exhaust pours out in the form of 40,000 pounds of 
thrust. Some of the engine parts are heated to a constant temperature of 1,500 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
If anything goes wrong -- from damaging bird strikes to defective materials or 
improper maintenance -- the engine can be thrown out of balance and start to 
devour itself. Unless the crew gets enough advance warning from vibration or 
heat indicators, the engine is likely to blow apart. 
</P>
<P>
Most engine failures occur when one or more of the turbine blades breaks. FAA 
rules require that the engine cowling be strong enough to contain one blade. 
Much of the engineering debate over the past decade has focused on whether the 
standard should be raised to a two- or three-blade containment standard. 
</P>
<P>
But blades alone don't usually pose the greatest threat. Flight 232, for 
example, lost its entire rotor assembly: several hundred pounds of engine 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
Experts contend that no aircraft, even an armored fighter plane, could 
withstand the impact of a hurtling 300-pound jet engine disc without suffering 
serious structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being hit with a 100-millimeter shell," said Clyde Kizer, vice 
president for engineering and maintenance for the Air Transport Assn. in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Built Like a Tank' 
</P>
<P>
Anthony J. Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory 
standards and compliance, said the plane would have to be built "like a tank" 
to take that kind of explosive force. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no practical way to build to protect against the enormous release of 
energy in an uncontrolled fashion," he said. "This appears to be a unique 
occurrence -- one that every effort is made to prevent, but one that cannot be 
protected against by design." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some fairly radical design concepts have been discussed in the 
relative privacy of industry seminars over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, at an international conference in Ankara, Turkey, for example, a team 
of British engineers proposed a redesigned three-engine jumbo jet in which 
baggage compartments would replace passenger areas between the wing engines. 
Passengers in first class would sit well forward of the engines and coach 
passengers safely aft. 
</P>
<P>
The hypothetical configuration apparently was influenced by an accident two 
years earlier over New Mexico in which a wing-mounted engine on a National 
Airlines DC-10 exploded while cruising at 39,000 feet. Shrapnel struck the 
fuselage, punctured a window and caused a passenger to be hurled to his death 
when, in the explosive decompression, he was sucked out through the hole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deflection Devices 
</P>
<P>
The same conference examined suggestions for strategically located deflection 
devices or armor in areas of the wings or fuselage most vulnerable to 
catastrophic impact. 
</P>
<P>
And a 1977 report by a leading U.S. engineering group, the Society of 
Automotive Engineers, recommended that aircraft makers consider using 
lightweight, energy-absorbing materials as shields for critical components. 
</P>
<P>
Design engineers say it is technically possible also to build an armored 
cowling that could contain a massive rotor burst. However, that would require 
adding about 50% to the weight of each engine, making the plane, at best, 
impractical to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have an engine of weight and handleability suitable for a power 
station but not for an aircraft," wrote an engineering executive for 
Rolls-Royce in a research paper. 
</P>
<P>
One problem facing engineers is that the causes of engine explosions vary so 
greatly. Foreign objects, like large birds, can bend or break turbine blades. 
Improper maintenance has contributed to a number of failures. The most common 
causes of significant disc failures are fatigue and defective materials, both 
of which are difficult to detect. 
</P>
<P>
Periodic engine inspections are supposed to spot the earliest signs of stress 
or fatigue. A crack as small as 1/32 of an inch in any disc is sufficient to 
require instant replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The GE engines on Flight 232 had a laboratory-tested life expectancy of 54,000 
cycles (or takeoffs and landings). The FAA requires that all the GE engines be 
retired after one-third of that time, however. When it blew up over Iowa, the 
United engine was nearing its mandatory 18,000-cycle retirement, but its 15,503 
cycles were still well short of a maximum life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to find out what flaw . . . occurred in Iowa to give rise to a 
fracture," said the FAA's Broderick. "It could have risen at the very beginning 
of the forging process or anywhere through the manufacturing or installation 
process or into the maintenance or service or, conceivably, from foreign object 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why it is critical to find those parts," he said. "If we don't find the 
parts, we cannot prove what happened." GE is offering a total of more than a 
quarter of million dollars in rewards for engine fragments, ranging from the 
disc, which is the size of a "large truck tire," to half-inch bolts. 
</P>
<P>
What investigators already believe happened is that large chunks of hot engine 
debris blew through both the left and right horizontal stabilizers of Flight 
232, knocking out two hydraulic lines on one side and the third backup line on 
the other. All hydraulic fluid was lost and, with it, virtually all control of 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Room for Improvements 
</P>
<P>
As pressure apparently mounts on aircraft makers to find ways to better protect 
vital systems on jetliners, many experts still believe there is room to improve 
engine design, manufacturing methods and maintenance practices to further 
reduce the incidence of uncontained failures. 
</P>
<P>
Even England's Gunstone, who said engines can't be made perfect, scolded the 
industry for not putting more effort into making engines safer when he told an 
international conference: 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is in all aircraft engine design a process of 'brinksmanship.' 
That is to say you push the design as far as you dare. Your constraints are 
economics, thrust, and so on, and you do not, unfortunately, apply all the 
knowledge which you've acquired from previous experience to making an engine or 
aircraft safer. You use some of it, but the rest goes into making it cheaper. 
It is a matter of some judgment as to where the proper balance lies." 
</P>
<P>
MD-11 PLAN FOR FUEL TANK IN TAIL 
</P>
<P>
The MD-11, McDonnell Douglas' stretched version of the DC-10 now being readied 
for certification by the FAA, is designed with basically the same hydraulic 
control system that was disabled by a DC-10 tail engine explosion last month. 
In addition, the longer range MD-11 incorporates a 2,000-gallon fuel tank under 
the rear engine. Industry and federal investigators are now re-evaluating 
designs in order to protect critical components from uncontained engine 
explosions.

SALONEN CHOSEN MUSIC DIRECTOR OF PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finnish conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen has been chosen to succeed Andre Previn as 
music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Salonen, 31, is to be announced to members of the orchestra 
at a Hollywood Bowl rehearsal Monday morning, with a press conference to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen, who will be the 11th music director in the 70-year history of the 
orchestra, arrived in Los Angeles from Europe on Saturday after lengthy 
secretive negotiations with the Philharmonic management. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders had regarded him as a prime contender for the post since Previn 
resigned in April. However, the acrimonious nature of Previn's withdrawal and 
Salonen's candidacy for other major orchestral openings had cast some doubt 
regarding his willingness to accept. Previn had contended that the orchestra's 
managing director, Ernest Fleischmann, had usurped the music director's duties. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen has enjoyed special favor with the Philharmonic management and local 
audiences since his U.S. debut here in 1984. Ironically, he was to have been 
named principal guest conductor of the orchestra last season, but the plan was 
abandoned after a classic conflict of directorial interests. 
</P>
<P>
Without Previn's official approval, Fleischmann had signed Salonen to take the 
orchestra on a tour. When Previn objected, exercising his contractual 
prerogative, Salonen reportedly refused to serve as Previn's primary associate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Figure 
</P>
<P>
In taking over the musical leadership of the orchestra, Salonen is expected to 
please and appease the segment of the orchestra and public that found Previn 
highly competent but somewhat dull as a conductor and in his choice of 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Blond, lean and athletic, Salonen cuts a dramatic figure on the podium. He can 
be flashy and picturesque, but he is a serious musician who savors 
introspective challenges. A composer in his own right, he champions 
contemporary music and, unlike his predecessor, supports avant-garde 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard for me to understand," he has said, "why everybody's first 
priority isn't music that has just been composed." 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believed that Salonen's only serious rival for the Los Angeles 
post was British conductor Simon Rattle, who currently holds the title of 
principal guest conductor. He has repeatedly rejected similar offers from the 
Philharmonic, however, citing his devotion to the Birmingham Symphony and his 
desire to spend most of his time in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen first attracted international attention in 1983 when, as a virtual 
unknown, he replaced Michael Tilson Thomas on five days' notice to conduct the 
London Philharmonia in the daunting Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has led the orchestras of West Berlin, New York, Chicago, 
Boston, Philadelphia, Paris, Montreal, Minneapolis and Washington. He has 
assumed permanent assignments in London (principal guest with the 
Philharmonia), Stockholm (principal conductor of the Swedish Radio Orchestra) 
and Norway (principal guest of the Oslo Philharmonic).

John E. Matwick was describing the rigors of searching for a twin-engine plane 
in some of the roughest territory and most contrary weather conditions in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"With the weather so bad, the hard thing is just keeping track of where you 
have searched," the 33-year-old Palos Verdes, Calif., native said at Addis 
Ababa airport after a 10-hour day spent searching fruitlessly for the missing 
plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 15 others. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather diverted us a lot today because the low visibility and high 
terrain makes it very dangerous flying." 
</P>
<P>
Matwick smiled wanly and said, "They've been long days." 
</P>
<P>
The largest deployment so far of U.S. and Ethiopian aircraft failed Saturday to 
turn up any trace of the missing plane, a two-engine Twin Otter, which vanished 
Monday. Leland, 44, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, eight 
other Americans and seven Ethiopians were en route from Addis Ababa to a camp 
for Sudanese refugees at Fugnido, about 320 miles west of the capital near the 
Sudanese border. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time the search was joined by four American MH-60 Blackhawk 
helicopters, which can better survey heavily forested areas than C-130 
airplanes like Matwick's. The MH-60 helicopters can be refueled in midair; the 
four craft were each refueled three times Saturday during their search. 
</P>
<P>
The four copters and two C-130s are part of an armada of 18 aircraft, including 
12 Ethiopian planes and helicopters, that in the last five days have scanned a 
100,000-square-mile area, a region about the size of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said some of the Ethiopian aircraft concentrated on a triangular 
area between the towns of Gambela and Dembi Dolo, west of Addis Ababa and near 
the Sudanese border, because of reports that peasants had reported hearing a 
plane Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
An American plane also searched an area north of the capital where a U.S. U-2 
spy plane sighted a plume of smoke during an overflight Thursday. But the smoke 
appeared to have originated from a settlement bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
As participants in the search were displaying increasing frustration and 
pessimism at their inability to spot the Leland plane, signs emerged that the 
joint U.S. and Ethiopian rescue mission might mark a watershed in what had been 
deteriorating relations between the two countries for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see how this close cooperation cannot but affect the attitudes of 
people, both critics and supporters, toward closeness with Ethiopia," said 
Robert Houdek, charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy. "I'm very heartened by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government, American sources said, has made available all 
equipment, personnel and facilities requested by the United States, even to the 
point of rearranging its own flight schedules and airport arrangements in Addis 
Ababa to make room for the American air fleet. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no formal arrangement so far, Houdek said, for the United States 
to reimburse the Ethiopians for the considerable expense of their part of the 
search or to provide badly needed spare parts or technical assistance to the 
country's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the search mission comes at a time when Ethiopian President 
Mengistu Haile Mariam is expressing a desire for closer relations with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
These relations soured during President Jimmy Carter's Administration, when 
Mengistu was apparently irked at Washington's refusal to provide better 
military assistance during his desert war with neighboring Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, Ethiopia became the closest thing in Africa to a 
client state of the Soviet Union, whose willingness to provide the help that 
the United States refused is reflected in a monumental statue of Lenin that 
dominates one of Addis Ababa's most striking downtown boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Aid Dries Up 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, the Soviets have been resisting Mengistu's pleas for 
more military aid, which has been drained away in the government's long and 
inconclusive war with rebels in the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American officials here Saturday again rejected earlier complaints 
-- from Leland's Washington staff and two congressional colleagues who arrived 
here Friday -- that the U.S. response to the congressman's disappearance had 
been tardy and inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Joseph De Minico, a commander of search operations who arrived here 
Saturday to take over management of the mission, called the deployment of 
American men and equipment "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
"To move in this many military assets in this short a time is just 
extraordinary," he said. "I think what we're doing here is just right."

Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress, has had a stroke and 
has been flown to Britain for treatment, sources close to the movement said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the 71-year-old ANC leader had a stroke Wednesday in Lusaka 
and was flown to Britain on Friday in a jet belonging to a British 
multinational company. ANC spokesmen were not immediately available to give 
details of Tambo's condition or where he was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
Tambo was absent Thursday from a summit meeting in Lusaka of the presidents of 
six southern African black countries and the leaders of the ANC, the main black 
guerrilla group fighting the white government in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo represented the movement at the meeting. Asked 
to explain Tambo's absence, ANC spokesmen said then that he was on a holiday 
and having a short rest. 
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the ANC, Tambo is widely seen as a moderate, although he 
firmly advocates armed struggle as part of the group's overall campaign to 
eliminate apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a spokesman for a British multinational company, Lonrho, confirmed 
that a company jet flew Tambo, accompanied by a doctor and a nurse, to London. 
</P>
<P>
"Our company jet was in Lusaka on another business mission and was coming back 
to Europe. With a little rerouting, we were able to be of assistance to Oliver 
Tambo," the spokesman said.

TENSION HEIGHTENED OVER PROTESTANTS' PARADE;

IRA BOMBING PRECEDES ULSTER MARCH

<TEXT>
<P>
A bomb planted by the outlawed Irish Republican Army exploded here Saturday as 
thousands of Protestants gathered to march in a parade celebrating a victory 
over a Roman Catholic king three centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion, wrecking a bar four hours before the Apprentice Boys' Parade but 
causing no injuries, underlined tensions as Northern Ireland approached the 
20th anniversary of the British government's decision to send troops to Ulster. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Apprentice Boys' Parade in 1969 that touched off rioting in Roman 
Catholic areas and led to troops arriving in the province on Aug. 14, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's bombing, said marcher Robert Kerr, "means we have no security." 
</P>
<P>
"For the amount of money they're spending, we should get better security," said 
Kerr, who drove 60 miles from his farm near Dungannon to join the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a Butcher Street bar. It 
had been discovered by security forces who evacuated the area, but it exploded 
before army experts could defuse it, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRA Statement 
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the IRA said the bomb was timed to go off when security 
forces were in the area. By planting the device, the statement said, the IRA 
proved it could strike despite heavy security. 
</P>
<P>
The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, police said they had seized a bomb packed with 10 pounds of 
Semtex plastic explosives and arrested two men in the Catholic Creggan 
neighborhood of Londonderry. 
</P>
<P>
There was heavy security Saturday along the parade route across the broad River 
Foyle and through the picturesque walled city, with dozens of armored police 
vehicles in the streets and soldiers patrolling in full combat gear. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary, a provincial police force, reported that the 
parade passed without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Londonderry has long been a place of mythic significance to Protestants as the 
scene of a 15-week siege in 1689 by the forces of the exiled Catholic King 
James II, who had been ousted in favor of the Protestant William of Orange, the 
Dutch-born prince who ruled Britain jointly with his English wife and cousin, 
Mary. 
</P>
<P>
The "no surrender" spirit of the apprentice boys who slammed the city gates to 
prevent their leader from capitulating lives on as a political slogan for the 
so-called Loyalist side -- the large segment of the Protestant community that 
supports British rule. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 12 is the day the siege was lifted.

IRELAND'S WEST AWAKENS, FIGHTS BACK AS CHANGES THREATEN ITS WAY OF LIFE 
</P>

MURRISK, County Mayo, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was once Ireland's Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
When England's Oliver Cromwell put down an Irish rebellion in the 17th Century 
and turned the rich Irish midlands over to English landlords, he offered the 
displaced natives a choice of death or banishment. 
</P>
<P>
"To Hell or to Connaucht!" was Cromwell's cry, using the name by which the 
region west of the Shannon River is still known. And given the stark, 
mountainous terrain, infertile soil, heavy annual rainfall and biting winds 
characteristic of much of the area, that may not have been much of a choice. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred years later, the potato famine took an especially heavy toll in 
Connaucht. And of the millions that fled Ireland through the centuries, the 
western part of the country contributed a disproportionately high share of 
emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The same history has marked those who stayed behind as well, teaching them 
first how to survive, then how to love their unique region -- and implanting in 
the western Irish character notable streaks of individuality, determination and 
a general distrust of bigness and outside authority. 
</P>
<P>
Now, another element has been added -- an enthusiasm for grass-roots political 
organization. And the whole lot has been mobilized into a vigorous defense 
against what residents see as threats to their land and the style of life it 
nurtures. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling Cromwell's dictate, Murrisk schoolteacher and community activist 
Denis Carroll told a visitor recently: "West of Ireland people -- I think 
they've had enough of being pushed around. They feel very strongly about 
preserving something that for so long was seen as useless." 
</P>
<P>
Amid a general environmental awakening throughout the region, residents are 
particularly making their weight felt in two continuing conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Both are complex, with no clear divisions into good guys and bad guys. But they 
have each captured national attention and, in the process, given the outside 
world a new prism through which to view the Irish experience. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Murrisk, at the base of the mountain from which the 5th-Century patron 
St. Patrick is said to have banished snakes from Ireland, citizens have mounted 
a campaign to block development of a local gold strike. It's an Irish echo of 
the early days of America's environmental activism, with opponents insisting 
that the danger to the area's pristine air, water and scenery is not worth the 
boost the project would give to the admittedly depressed local economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church has weighed heavily into the debate. And a rally in 
nearby Westport a few weeks ago drew a crowd of more than 3,000 people to hear 
environmentalists decry the dangers of mining. It was reputedly the largest 
such assembly since anti-British protests in colonial days. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a few miles south, anglers around wind-swept Lake Corrib are leading 
the way in a two-year-old boycott to protest the government's introduction of a 
mandatory "rod license" for trout fishing. The conflict has gotten nastier as 
striking anglers, defending what they see as their historic right to free 
fishing in local lakes, square off against neighbors who say their right to 
make a living has been infringed by the boycotters. 
</P>
<P>
The fracas is said to have cost Ireland tens of millions of dollars in lost 
income from tourists who traditionally flock here for the trout fishing season. 
Anti-rod license activists also campaigned vigorously against Prime Minister 
Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) party and, according to 
political analysts in Dublin, may have cost it June's general election. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody you talk to in the west of Ireland thinks everything is tied up 
politically," said Robert O'Connor, a Connaucht native now working as a 
consultant for Dublin's Economic &amp; Social Research Institute. "They're very 
cynical about things in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
Connaucht no longer exists as an administrative entity, but the name is still 
commonly used in reference to all or part of six counties: Clare, Galway, 
Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. The population is about 400,000 out of 
Ireland's total of 3.6 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
The region they inhabit remains the poorest part of the country, O'Connor said. 
Incomes are nearly 20% below the national average. Where the center of the 
country has lush meadowlands, the west of Ireland has peat bogs. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, this is the Ireland of the picture postcards. Tidy houses 
with white lace curtains dot the hills, set off by neat stone fences. Sheep 
graze mountains and foothills blanketed in a seemingly infinite number of 
shades of green. And there is water everywhere: mountain brooks, scores of 
fresh water lakes, bays and inlets off the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The waters are famous among anglers for their salmon, trout, pike and perch. 
And except for salmon, which have long held special status, fishermen have 
traditionally been free to cast their lines at will. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in the west of Ireland there was always this -- you could fish any of the 
big western lakes for free," said Des Nolan, an Anaugh Down teacher and 
spokesman for anglers protesting the new rod license. "Even when the English 
ruled this country, you didn't have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
The license fees, enacted in December, 1987, were ostensibly to be used to 
improve the lakes and keep them stocked. But Ireland's anglers see darker 
motives afoot -- everything from a government lake grab that will turn their 
waters into corporate fish farms, to a surreptitious attempt to introduce the 
principle of a national identity card. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, said Nolan, the issue is freedom. "As far as we're concerned," 
he added, "this is an infringement of our civil rights, pure and simple. It's 
not just catching the trout. It's the pleasure of being out there on the lake, 
knowing you're free. There's something about it that's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan shrugged helplessly. "No one is ever able to write it down." 
</P>
<P>
When bailiffs began confiscating boats and fishing gear from anglers who defied 
the license requirement, the fishermen decided on the opposite approach. They 
quit fishing, and did their best to make sure everyone else did too. 
</P>
<P>
One sees the impact in Oughterard, a village of 700 on the shores of vast Lake 
Corrib that is sometimes called the capital of the "rod war." The boycott 
placards tacked up all over town are obvious; the signs of the severe economic 
impact more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
The latter are found at the Anglers' Bar &amp; Lounge, which was virtually 
empty on a recent Saturday night. Or at Sweeney's Oughterard House Hotel, where 
owner-manager Patrick Higgins recalled wistfully how he used to drum up 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a good catch of fish, what I would do is pop them up on the bar," 
he said. Then he'd offer to set up a fishing outing for admiring guests the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
They don't arrange fishing trips from Sweeney's these days. For that you have 
to go to the other side of town, to Lal Flaherty, who is defying the boycott. 
Flaherty, who runs a 10-room lakeside guest house catering to fishermen, won an 
injunction in June against local anglers who were harassing his customers. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow road to his place is lined with hand-lettered posters reading 
"Traitor" and "Don't Sell Out for 30 Pieces of Silver." 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty said he didn't want the rod license any more than anyone else. But now 
it's the law, and besides, "This is what we make our living doing, and nothing 
else." He said he would have more respect for the protesters if they defied the 
license requirement and went to jail for their beliefs rather than pressing 
their case by trying to impose their will on others. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty's business is down by about 60% in the nearly two years since the 
conflict started, he said. A native of Oughterard, he added that he is 
"surprised and very disappointed" at how the issue has come between him and 
friends he has known since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty concedes he represents a small minority. Meanwhile, Nolan and the 
great majority here promise that the boycott will continue until the government 
backs down. They're even ready to accept alternate types of fees, Nolan said. 
But the rod license must go, he added, because "it's a matter of principle." 
</P>
<P>
Around Murrisk, meanwhile, the matter is an explosive mixture of gold, 
religious tradition and environmental protection, and the conflict is just 
starting. Developers Burmin Exploration and a subsidiary of the Finnish state 
mining company don't even plan to apply for necessary government permission to 
exploit their estimated $100-million claim until next month. But because of its 
location on Croagh (Mt.) Patrick -- "the Mt. Sinai of Ireland" -- the battle 
has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its scenic perch overlooking the shellfish-rich Clew Bay, Croagh 
Patrick has been a site of religious pilgrimage for 1,500 years. On the last 
Sunday of each July there is a special ceremony at a chapel on the 2,500-foot 
summit that attracts thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents over a period of 1,500 years an incomparable accumulation of 
spiritual wealth," the area's Roman Catholic archbishop, Joseph Cassidy, said 
of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
While the gold might mean economic development, the clergyman cautioned, "There 
is more wealth on the surface of that mountain than could ever be taken from 
inside. To be passionately protective about Patrick's mountain is not an 
exercise in pious obscurantism; it is an instinctive and enlightened response 
by a thinking people." 
</P>
<P>
"People are aroused at a number of levels," Father Tony King, pastor of St. 
Mary's Roman Catholic Church in nearby Westport, said in an interview. "It's an 
issue of people, their place, their environment and their national heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the additional powerful element of Irish religious tradition 
involved, environmentalists consider it vital to make a stand. 
</P>
<P>
"If mining in the Croagh Patrick area goes ahead, there's no area in Ireland 
that's sacred," said Denis Carroll, the teacher who also heads the recently 
formed Murrisk Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A second gold strike in a valley a few miles south of Croagh Patrick has some 
people talking about a possible "Irish Klondike" in Connaucht. 
</P>
<P>
Burmin officials admit that the amount of opposition they face caught them off 
guard. But they insist that they are being unfairly judged and that once they 
complete their development plans, they will be able to satisfy all but their 
most obdurate critics that they can mine on Croagh Patrick without damaging 
either environment or religious tradition. 
</P>
<P>
A government Geological Survey official agreed that the fears have gotten out 
of hand. "These are Irish lads," he said of Burmin's executives. "They're not 
people coming in from outside who want to rape the land." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the inevitable public hearings that will follow Burmin's filing of 
a development plan promise to be stormy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ancestors may have been pushed around," anti-mining activist Carroll said. 
"But we aren't going to be -- either by mining companies or our own 
politicians."

An estimated 300 mourners, including Mayor Edward I. Koch, attended a funeral 
Mass Saturday for slain anti-drug crusader Maria Hernandez, amid heavy security 
to prevent further violence against her family. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 34, a mother of three who with her husband fought to force drug 
dealers out of her Brooklyn neighborhood, was shot to death Tuesday, possibly 
in retaliation for her anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
During a 70-minute Mass conducted in Spanish and English at St. John the 
Baptist Catholic Church, the Rev. Charles Plock praised the woman's efforts to 
transform her neighborhood into a place where there would be "no mourning, no 
tears, no fear. She labored and she struggled and she fought. She organized 
people to make her community reflect this new heaven and this new Earth. Maria 
gave her life because she was not afraid to speak the truth."

Volunteers from throughout the black community began patrolling the streets and 
alleys of a neighborhood northwest of Watts on Saturday as an unprecedented 
community-based street patrol campaign aimed at ending gang violence and drug 
abuse in South-Central Los Angeles got underway. 
</P>
<P>
One man hobbled on crutches. Another brought his 6-month-old nephew in a baby 
carriage. They were among about 70 men and women who participated in the first 
day of "Taking Our Community Back," a grass-roots effort organized by the 
Brotherhood Crusade to clean up and provide safety in the neighborhood for at 
least 30 to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Through the rest of August and into September, a 110-square-block area bordered 
by 93rd Street, Avalon Boulevard, Central Avenue and Manchester Avenue will be 
swept, painted and patrolled by volunteers. Unarmed "brotherhood protection 
teams" will roam the neighborhood 24 hours a day, reporting crimes to a command 
center, which will, in turn, notify police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get to Know People 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, patrol representatives from the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, community churches and the Fruit of Islam got to know the people in 
the neighborhood they have pledged to help. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to observe what's going on in the community," said Brotherhood 
Crusade President Danny Bakewell to volunteers gathered for a patrol 
orientation at Green Meadows Recreation Center. "You're talking to the people, 
talking to the homeowners, letting them know we're trying to make their 
community safe." 
</P>
<P>
Talk they did -- to a 36-year-old man, standing barefoot in front of the 
housing project that he has called home for the last 18 years. And to an 
ex-Marine from Compton who showed up to walk with them. And to an emaciated 
young woman who was taking her children, dressed in filthy clothes, in the 
direction of a rock house. 
</P>
<P>
"Take care of these beautiful kids," volunteer Mae Thomas told the woman, who 
tried to avoid her gaze. "You can get help. Tell the drug man, 'I'm sorry, I 
can't go with you anymore. I'm going with the Brotherhood Crusade.' "

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1978, as a young, white Southern businessman with strong conservative 
feelings of alienation about the Democratic Party, F. Borden Hanes Jr. switched 
his registration to Republican. 
</P>
<P>
There was one candidate for the U.S. Senate, in particular, whom Hanes found a 
politically kindred spirit and for whose reelection campaign Hanes organized a 
group of other like-minded young men. Hanes recalls that the group raised 
between $30,000 and $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Their man won. His name: Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
"I raised a pretty good slug of money for him," said Hanes. When Helms ran for 
reelection again five years ago, Hanes worked behind the scenes in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with him on a lot of things, but there are ideas in which I'm 
with him," Hanes said, "such as free enterprise, foreign policy and economics. 
But on the abortion issue (and the larger) conservative social agenda, I just 
don't identify with it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, there is something strikingly ironic about watching 
Borden Hanes pick up a copy of a local newspaper that has published a color 
reproduction of a photograph titled "Piss Christ." It is an image of a plastic 
crucifix immersed in a tank of the artist's own urine. 
</P>
<P>
The photograph, the work of New York photographer Andres Serrano, 38, was 
included in a show sponsored last year by the Southeastern Center for 
Contemporary Art, of which Borden Hanes is chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
SECCA (pronounced "SEEK-uh") has been targeted by Helms in what most observers 
agree is the most profound crisis for the National Endowment for the Arts since 
the federal agency was founded nearly 25 years ago. (The NEA has helped fund 
SECCA.) Helms and a handful of Republican state legislators in Raleigh have 
seized on the depiction of the crucifix and the NEA's funding of a show of 
photographs -- some depicting homoerotic and sadomasochistic themes -- by the 
late Robert Mapplethorpe to launch a campaign at the state and federal levels 
to ban public funding for offensive or indecent artworks. 
</P>
<P>
It was the controversial photograph that drew Hanes and the boards of SECCA and 
the old-money, blueblood foundation set up by the will of James G. Hanes, 
Borden's granduncle, which provides about one-quarter of SECCA's funding, into 
the political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hanes had been discussing his past support for Helms while sitting in what was 
once the parlor in the main house on the former estate of James G. Hanes, who 
had run the family's textile business. The house is now a part of the 32-acre, 
wooded campus-like setting for SECCA's headquarters. Carefully, Hanes studied 
"Piss Christ," in which the crucifix can be clearly identified in front of a 
reddish background. "I didn't even look at the title initially," he said. "It 
gave me a sense of peace. I felt good about it. I didn't know at the time what 
it was submerged in. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a pretty innovative approach. That amber hue is not only very 
colorful, but it conveys a sense of passivity." 
</P>
<P>
He analyzed the photograph with a knowing eye. He says that, in the decade 
since his family urged him to join SECCA's board, he has become an ardent fan 
of some of art's most avant-garde work. 
</P>
<P>
"My vision would be that SECCA is a nationally recognized organization -- one 
that the arts community in New York and Los Angeles can respect as on the 
cutting edge of contemporary art, with feeling for the artists and feeling for 
the communities that we serve. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that, in the long run, the flak is going to be beneficial." He 
reasons that it will make people aware of SECCA, and those sympathetic to its 
cause may contribute money. 
</P>
<P>
Redge Hanes, Borden Hanes' cousin and chairman of the James G. Hanes 
Foundation, is even blunter about the need for artists to work free of 
political pressure. "If art doesn't provoke, who needs it? You can go buy 
wallpaper from decorators." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has probably brought an end to Borden Hanes' support for Helms. But 
even today, Hanes said he could probably call Helms and get through. He has 
never placed the call. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think he's got his mind made up," Hanes said of Helms. "No matter what 
I would say, would he change his opinion becauses of something I would say? I 
think there is an element in his support structure that has really got his 
attention here. I can't identify with it. I'm just going to have to think about 
whether I can vote for him again." 
</P>
<P>
Borden Hanes comes from one of the two old-line Winston-Salem families that are 
the social bedrock in this Forsyth County city of about 135,000. There are the 
Haneses, of the textile company family that gave the world Hanes T-shirts and 
underwear, and there is the family descended from the tobacco fortune of R. J. 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in an overstuffed chair, Hanes, attired in a neat, dark suit, reflected 
on what has become the irony of this political affiliation. Hanes, 44, has 
shunned the limelight as the SECCA crisis has developed. But it has exploded 
around him, like it or not. The executive vice-president of an investment 
counseling firm with offices here and in Atlanta, Hanes finds himself and SECCA 
embroiled in a nasty political dispute that has made him personally 
uncomfortable and, to a certain extent, even divided his family. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Awards in the Visual Arts, a pioneer program organized by 
SECCA's director, Ted Potter, nearly a decade ago, included Serrano among the 
10 people it recognized as the nation's emerging artists. Among the works 
included by Serrano in the annual touring show that is one of the key rewards 
of winning the AVA (pronounced "AY-vuh") was "Piss Christ." The show that 
included Serrano's photograph toured to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
last year. The current year's show (without the photo), the eighth annual AVA 
exhibit, opens Saturday at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The show 
has been seen in Atlanta and travels to Seattle and New York after its run in 
La Jolla closes Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
AVA seeks to break the stranglehold on art recognition held by large population 
centers such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles by dividing the country into 
10 districts -- each of which includes about the same number of artists. Thus, 
AVA Area 2 includes only Manhattan and Area 10 is only Southern California and 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Each district produces one of the 10 annual winners. It is the only visual arts 
competition in the country in which someone working in North Dakota has the 
same opportunity to be selected for national recognition as an artist in SoHo 
or the West Village in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA provides about $70,000 of the AVA program's annual budget -- a total of 
$412,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a bill working its way through the Congress, SECCA faces a pending 
five-year ban on eligibility for federal arts grants and narrowly averted an 
attempt in the North Carolina legislature to permanently bar the agency from 
grants by the North Carolina Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
A House-Senate conference committee in Washington will try to reach a 
compromise on the NEA funding bill after Labor Day. Observers agree, however, 
that if the ban on public funding for offensive art survives, and if the 
blacklisting of SECCA and the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University 
of Pennsylvania (which organized a show of Mapplethorpe's work) sticks, the 
endowment could not function. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the actual "Piss Christ" photograph, 40 by 60 inches long, has 
never been exhibited in North Carolina, Potter said. Serrano's submission was 
selected by a panel of jurors who viewed his work on slides. The exhibit in 
which the photo itself was included didn't come to North Carolina. The original 
print has been sold by Stux Gallery in New York, which represents Serrano, to 
an anonymous private collector. 
</P>
<P>
Helms did not respond to several requests for an interview. In May, however, 
Helms said in a Senate speech that criticized the AVA competition: "This 
program, supported by the National Endowment, is administered by the 
Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art. They call it SECCA. I am sorry to say 
it is in my home state." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina Republican State Sen. Michael Decker, who sponsored a bill to 
ban SECCA from state funding and who has been in close contact with Helms' 
office on the issue, said the controversy over "Piss Christ" raises basic 
questions of the appropriateness of public money being used to finance arts 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Decker, a high school history teacher who lives in Walkertown, a community near 
Winston-Salem, said he was drawn to the issue because he was repelled by the 
title and subject matter of the photograph -- although he had not seen the 
image in color until a reporter showed him one from a catalogue in Raleigh last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if you are an individual citizen and you want to go to an art 
gallery, that would be one thing," Decker said. "You have a choice. But 
taxpayers don't have that choice. I don't think it's proper to force them to 
subsidize something they would find offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think art has a place and I think we can fund it, but I'm certainly not for 
funding these horrendous things that are being put on us in the name of art." 
</P>
<P>
Decker said he supported a measure offered in the state senate after he 
introduced his own bill, which would ban state funding for religiously 
offensive art. He believes that just as civil rights laws were used to prohibit 
public money being used in support of racial segregation, the same principle 
can apply to keeping public support away from offensive artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"My main design is to prevent people from showing things that they call art 
that are offensive to the vast majority of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Decker said the system he envisions would preclude an art museum that has state 
support for the salary of its curator, for instance, from accepting a privately 
supported traveling show that included offensive work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that one person should try to formulate a definition of what is 
acceptable," he said. "(But) I'd be glad to be on a group of people who would 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
The situation has so upset Borden Hanes that the muscles in his face tense 
noticeably when he talks about it. To him and his cousin Redge Hanes, a 
registered Democrat, the political tempest threatens to damage a program that 
SECCA, which was founded in 1956, has spent years organizing specifically to 
challenge the supremacy of the East Coast-West Coast art Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
And, the two cousins fear that continuing publicity could even endanger private 
financial support, which forms the backbone of SECCA's $1.7-million annual 
budget. The North Carolina Arts Council contributes about $70,000. Besides the 
James G. Hanes Foundation's contribution, the remaining support is raised from 
private sources -- most of them local and regional contributors. 
</P>
<P>
For several years the bulk of AVA's funding was supplied by the Rockefeller and 
Equitable Foundations. This year, BMW of North America Inc., the luxury car 
importer, joined the two foundations as a sponsor and will host the New York 
showing of the 1989 work at the BMW Gallery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
A couple years ago SECCA got a $300,000 NEA grant that required it to raise 
matching funds. A campaign that is just being concluded brought in $4 million 
to build the new exhibit center and provide financing for other SECCA programs. 
</P>
<P>
Potter said that between 70,000 and 90,000 people attend shows at SECCA here. 
Another 500,000 view traveling shows -- mostly in the South -- that SECCA 
organizes. 
</P>
<P>
So far, said Redge Hanes, local people who support SECCA have remained 
supportive, but the board is increasingly concerned about financial fallout. 
"If you make an institution untouchable, then there are subtle movements of 
potential funders away from that institution for reasons they can't even 
identify," said Redge Hanes. 
</P>
<P>
"If SECCA is denied federal funding because of one photograph, if that's fair, 
then, my God, this country is into some very serious problems. Our foundation 
is not saying that we don't personally find the title of that picture somewhat 
offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Redge Hanes, a member of the more politically liberal wing of the Hanes family 
and a registered Democrat, is closely associated with U.S. Sen. Terry Sanford, 
North Carolina's junior senator. He is also on the boards of the American Arts 
Alliance and the American Council for the Arts, two of the largest arts 
advocacy groups in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The ramifications of an attack on SECCA, just as the South is beginning to 
emerge as a nationally recognized center for the visual arts, make Redge Hanes 
so angry he can hardly contain himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it ironic that the self-same institution that is trying to break the 
stereotype of the South is the one that they are trying to slaughter? A lot of 
people from the South really resent the kind of superior attitude that people 
in other parts of the country have held," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps our mission is to eliminate the concept of regionalism. Art is one way 
to do that and possibly the only way. But if the McCarthys of this world can 
put us on a blacklist, then stand back, dude, because the next time the Mark 
Taper Forum (in Los Angeles) wants to put on a (politically or sexually 
controversial) play, if it's offensive to some people, the response will be: 
Zap 'em." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a very religious area here, where there are lot of born-again 
Christians," Borden Hanes said. "To them, it's very black and white. Even if we 
explain where Serrano is coming from, they don't want to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just focusing on the crucifix submerged in the artist's urine. That's 
all they can think about. They can't think about what he is trying to say and 
express and (how) the commercialization of Christianity is very disturbing to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do now is to continue to support First Amendment rights and the 
freedom of expression, but to have a little bit more political savvy and put 
the Serrano thing behind us as far as this community is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
As Borden Hanes sat talking in the parlor, the sounds of heavy construction 
equipment could be heard outside. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment is working to complete a new, $2.8-million, 23,000-square-foot 
addition to SECCA's plant, which will more than double the art center's 
exhibition space and include a 300-seat recital hall, sculpture terraces and 
badly needed storage space. The new structure is to be dedicated next April. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is a major exhibition center that organizes as many as 50 shows a 
year -- including those here and others that tour in North Carolina and the 
rest of the South -- SECCA does not have a permanent collection. The majority 
of its 21 full-time employees, including Potter, the executive director, are 
themselves working artists. 
</P>
<P>
Most works included in shows at the SECCA complex here are offered for sale, 
providing a badly needed commercial outlet for regional artists who have 
difficulty breaking into the gallery system dominated by New York, Chicago and 
Los Angeles. SECCA also sponsors a regional arts competition called the 
Southeast Seven that provides grants of its own. 
</P>
<P>
SECCA's arts education program is relied on heavily throughout the state. "It's 
an incredible organization," said Mary Regan, director of the North Carolina 
Arts Council in Raleigh. SECCA, said Regan, has helped develop interest in the 
arts throughout the state -- to a degree people outside the region might find 
surprising in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"I could take you out in this state to any community and I believe I would 
shatter your stereotype about what North Carolinians want," Regan said. "That 
stereotype would be that North Carolinians in small towns and rural areas are 
not that interested in the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Potter's vision is that SECCA is already -- and can become more of -- a force 
for change in a larger attempt to force the arts Establishment away from what 
he calls "the fly-over effect, where they go from New York to Los Angeles, look 
down (and see) nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole 'Hudson River mentality' drives me crazy. I've been saying for 25 
years that there are artists worth looking at and getting recognition 
everywhere." The Hudson River, which separates Manhattan from New Jersey, has 
what Potter calls a mythological influence, "that if an artist chooses to live 
on the wrong side of the Hudson River it's because he isn't good enough to live 
on the right side. You can't tell me that the (arts Establishment) doesn't 
still believe that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to accomplish (that change) and now this happens." 
</P>
<P>
Potter believes that our society doesn't "want to admit that our artists are 
serious. We want our artists to be perceived to be like self-indulgent 
children. It's amusing to have them at parties occasionally and we like them 
being just slightly naughty. 
</P>
<P>
"If artists are perceived as focusing on critical issues of what we do, we 
don't like that a bit. But whenever a society is dealing in depth with 
heartfelt critical issues, art responds. Some people get annoyed as hell if the 
artists want to come up with some kind of strong comment."

THE LEGACY OF TIMUR THE GREAT; 
</P>
<P>
LACMA'S REMARKABLE EXHIBITION TESTIFIES TO THE URBANE REFINEMENT OF ART UNDER 
THE CONQUEROR TAMERLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Devout followers of art do a good bit of grumping these days about the ways 
their sacred objects are being used. Junk bond traders use art to gain cultural 
prestige. Corporations finance luster-lending exhibitions. Right-wing 
legislators threaten to sanitize the National Endowment for the Arts. Art, in 
short, is being transformed from a garden of cultural insight into a political 
plow. 
</P>
<P>
A remarkable exhibition opening today at the County Museum of Art proves -- if 
it is any comfort -- that this is not the first time art has been put to work 
to tart up someone's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, on view to Nov. 15, is called "Timur and the Princely Vision" 
and concerns Persian art and culture in the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions about the Middle East tend to get Westerners balled up on account 
of current hostility and ignorance, plus real historical complications, all 
compounded by changes in scholarly convention. The lands that used to be known 
as Persia are now roughly encompassed by Iran. The tyrant here called Timur 
might be more readily recognized by his old occidental handle: Tamerlane the 
Great, or sometimes Tamerlane the Lame. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, him. Sure, I knew it all the time. He was the most awesome conqueror of the 
Middle East after his own hero Genghis Khan. 
</P>
<P>
Timur -- born in 1336 -- came roaring out of Transoxonia with his 
Turco-Mongolian hordes pillaging and plundering until he controlled an empire 
that gobbled up all of what is now Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq and chunks of 
India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, China and the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
Timur used terror systematically. One favorite trick was to mass the skulls of 
thousands of victims into huge columns outside the gates of cities he wished to 
impress. 
</P>
<P>
Decidedly not a nice guy, but a charismatic leader capable of unifying factions 
and a shrewd politician who used the arts to impress the rubes, mollify the 
opposition and, naturally, glorify his glorious self. 
</P>
<P>
This cultural manipulation is what the exhibition is all about, and it is a 
first. Put together by LACMA curator Thomas Lentz and Glenn D. Lowry, curator 
at the Freer and Sackler Galleries in Washington D.C., it is an understated 
triumph of organization. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone expecting to be bowled over by gallons of gold and cornucopias of 
precious stones as they walk into the exhibition should be forewarned. In the 
first place, the most grandiose Timurid art is its architectural monuments such 
as the sanctuary dome of the masjid-i jami of Timur in Samarqand, which can be 
shown only in photographic murals. In the second place, this is one of those 
revelatory pieces of scholarship whose very fine catalogue is a virtual must 
for getting the best from the show. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes stunning objects such as Chinese-style jade cups and 
sections of architectural mosaics, but the largest number of works are 
drawings, calligraphic sheets and illustrated manuscripts that include some of 
the greatest known examples. Artistic pleasure here comes from such rarefied 
masterpieces as a bookbinding as delicate as lace where silhouettes of plants 
and animals have been cut from a single piece of leather. That's just a trick, 
of course, as is the calligraphic page where microscopic arabesques are 
individually cut from paper. What makes them work is an exquisite sense of 
refinement that turns work after work into delicate visual poetry akin to 
patterns in a kaleidoscope. 
</P>
<P>
Such attenuated elegance did not represent Timur's personal taste, which tended 
to run to powerful candlesticks the size of cannon and Koran pages as big as 
pup tents. One hapless artist made Timur the Islamic version of the New 
Testament engraved on the head of a pin and he drummed the poor chap out of 
court. Who needs this little-bitty stuff? We need something huge to awe the 
plebes. The Trump Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
There were buildings aplenty and luckily Timur's vision was better than his 
taste. He needed the fealty of his Islamic subjects and so incorporated their 
literature, poetry and beliefs. He established Kitabkhana -- royal libraries or 
workshops that became the centers of art, literature and learning. (Many a 
Timurid noble paid pious patronage and lip service to Islam while violating 
most of its codes in private.) 
</P>
<P>
Timur introduced elaborate ritual codes into courtly ceremonies all designed to 
enhance his own awesomeness. Court etiquette was so complex that visitors had 
to be manhandled through the ceremonies to make sure they groveled correctly. 
This sense of convoluted correctness comes across in an art so intensely 
stylized it is a wonder it is often as fine as it is. 
</P>
<P>
Timur died in 1405 at age 69. Without his leadership the empire came unglued, 
potential successors scrapping bloodily. When the dust settled the emergent 
leader was called Shahrukh. Until 1447 he ruled over an empire that was as 
fragmented within as it was opulent without. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly the empire eroded into the kind of dalliance that is bad for politics 
and terrific for art. Manuscript illuminations and scalpel-sharp drawings tell 
the story in their style. They depict a world of disembodied pleasure where 
concubines loll in patterned rose gardens while the prince hunts, composes 
poetry, studies the Koran or consults his astrologer. (The stars were taken 
seriously. One prince drank himself to death after receiving a bad horoscope.) 
</P>
<P>
The pictures may seem unreal but they are the precise metaphor of the reigning 
ideal of the princely world -- separate, private and luxurious. As time wore 
on, cultural refinement held such sway that reputations were made and broken 
with literary quips and elaborate word games. During one of these literary 
jousts a noted social arbiter and wit became simultaneously annoyed at a door 
that was banging in the wind and another guest who was just as noisy. The wit 
asked someone to bolt the door. When the man rose to comply the wit said, "I 
meant to bolt it from the other side." 
</P>
<P>
There is a kind of predictability to histories of crumbling empires. As the 
Timurids lost yet more power they had to cultivate the good will of religious 
men, and we see a series of paintings of bedizened nobles visiting hermit 
monks. As things got even more out of hand there was a Reagan-style revival of 
The Good Old Days where Timur is depicted as the great hero -- the George 
Washington of his day, strong and wise. The paintings are as magnificent as 
their motive impulse is sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ferocious Uzbeks became belligerent in 1507, former Timurid 
boldness had given way to refinement. The empire was done for. Or was it? 
Timur's manipulative and eclectic artistic program turned out to be his 
greatest legacy. It set a standard for urbane refinement that held sway through 
four Turkish dynasties from the Uzbeks to the Mughals. Timurid aesthetics were 
so widespread that they mark one of the world's most fabled palaces. We think 
of the Taj Mahal as quintessentially Indian. As the show's curators whisper 
enticingly: "Hey, folks, the Taj Mahal is a Timurid-style building."

OUTTAKES: MEL TO THE RESCUE!

<P>
Is Goldie Hawn a damsel in distress -- at the box office? And can superhot Mel 
Gibson save her? 
</P>
<P>
He has just wrapped Universal's "Bird on a Wire" with Hawn, who hasn't had a 
substantial hit since 1980's "Private Benjamin," which grossed $70 million 
domestically and earned her an Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, grosses for 
Gibson's "Lethal Weapon 2" have passed $102 million. 
</P>
<P>
In "Wire," Gibson plays a former '60s activist on the run from drug smugglers 
with Hawn, his former flame-turned-hotshot lawyer. (The modern script doesn't 
even make reference to the fact that Hawn, 44, is a decade older than Gibson.) 
</P>
<P>
A rep for the actress called the role "a complete change of pace" for the 
actress: "It allows Goldie to do comedy, and be part of a touching love story. 
And as an adventure, this film is also very physical." 
</P>
<P>
But it's no comeback attempt, the spokeswoman stressed: "Goldie doesn't feel 
like she's been anywhere to come back from." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Hawn's post-"Private Benjamin" box office: 
</P>
<P>
"Seems Like Old Times" (1980) -- $38.2 million; "Best Friends" (1982) -- $36.6; 
"Swing Shift" (1984) -- $6.6; "Protocol" (1984) -- $26.1; "Wildcats" (1986) -- 
$26.1; "Overboard" (1988), $24.5 million.

The star's Hawn-Sylbert Movie Co. recently landed a seven-picture development 
deal with Hollywood Pictures, the new arm of Walt Disney Productions -- which 
has a recent tradition of reviving floundering careers. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: HORSE TRADING

<P>
Writer-director Christopher Coppola -- nephew of Francis Ford -- hopes to get 
his "Black Stallion III" under way this fall in Northern Nevada, he told us. 
He's just returned from North Dakota, where he found a new black Arabian to 
star in the latest film installment based on the series of Walter Farley young 
adult books. 
</P>
<P>
The original Black -- seen in the first two films (1979 and 1983) -- "was too 
old to be in the movie -- and he'd lost an eye in an accident," Christopher 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Reno, now 22, who starred in the two previous films, is also over the 
hill. His character -- a young boy who tames a stallion -- is in his mid-teens 
in "III," coping with the Black becoming wild again, against a '50s American 
west backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Rooney is expected back as the trainer, but casting is under way for the 
plum role of the boy.

The casting call was for a woman of 5-foot-4, size 22, about 230-260 pounds -- 
a Roseanne Barr body double for "She Devil." There was a catch: She had to be 
nude. 
</P>
<P>
Plus Models Ltd. of NYC -- which specializes in larger-size models -- took the 
call from the film's production office. The Orion comedy, which just wrapped in 
Gotham, stars Meryl Streep as a romance novelist who comes between clumsy 
housewife Barr and hubby, Ed Begley Jr. -- leading Barr to plot revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"But we couldn't find any girls who were interested (or the right size)," said 
Plus Models prez Pat Swift. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our girls start at 5-foot-8 1/2. Then there's the fact they wanted the 
girl to pose nude. You know, the bigger a girl gets, the more reluctant she 
tends to be about taking her clothes off." 
</P>
<P>
Swift also said the potential pay was well below usual for a day's 
nude/semi-nude work -- an initial offer of $125, later raised to $175. 
</P>
<P>
We aren't sure if a size 22 body double was ever found, or filmed. At press 
time, calls to the film's production office, Orion and Barr's publicist had not 
been returned. Pat H. Broeske

<P>
What could be creepier than a grown-up Freddy Krueger? How about Freddy as a 
tyke. In New Line Cinema's just-out "Nightmare on Elm Street, Part 5: The Dream 
Child," the little devil invades the nightmares of a young pregnant woman who's 
being pursued by Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
Baby Freddy's creator, special effects artist David Miller, told us that the 
tot has radio-controlled facial features -- to enhance its screams and cries -- 
and also operates as both a hand and a rod puppet. That allows for head, arm 
and leg movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's, um, kind of gross I guess," laughed Miller, 29, who created the makeup 
appliances and the Freddy "look" for the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Miller went on to work on projects including "Terminator," "Cocoon," Michael 
Jackson's "Thriller" and "a whole slew of horror films." 
</P>
<P>
"Nightmare 5" marks his return to what is easily his most infamous creation. 
Now at work on the syndicated "Nightmare on Elm Street" TV series, Miller 
chalks up Freddy's popularity to the fact that he frequently cracks one-liners 
after committing vile crimes.

YET IT'S STILL THE KIROV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oleg Vinogradov wasn't happy. An official representative warned us. 
</P>
<P>
The all-powerful chief choreographer and boldly independent artistic director 
of the Kirov Ballet, which opens an exclusive nine-performance stand at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday, apparently wasn't having much 
fun in Fun City. Something was getting lost in exportation. 
</P>
<P>
He had brought one of the most prestigious ensembles in the world -- some still 
call it the greatest of its kind -- from its cloistered home in Leningrad to 
the glamorous stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. Although his vaunted and 
revered company had toured other American cities -- including Los Angeles -- as 
recently as 1986, this was the first New York engagement ventured by the Kirov 
in a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
It was an important, symbolic return. Some things, alas, weren't going well. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets, to be sure, were gratifyingly scarce, even with a good orchestra seat 
costing $75. Audiences were enthusiastic -- as they invariably are when snob 
appeal runs high, when the repertory is accessible and the object of instant 
affection happens to hail from a mysterious locale behind the perestroika 
curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Still, recurring problems ruffled crucial composures. The reception by the New 
York press had been mixed at best, disenchanted at worst. Aficionados in and 
out of print were complaining that the repertory was stale, the tradition 
tarnished, the pervasive interpretive attitude old-fashioned and the dancing 
uneven. The women, for the most part, were garnering far more approval than the 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost or not, the would-be festive mood in the house was dampened by 
stringent security precautions. All patrons were frisked -- albeit 
half-heartedly -- upon entering. If anyone chose to exit during intermission, 
there could be no return. The standing-room area downstairs, normally haven for 
the most sophisticated balletomanes, was closed. Plain-clothed guardians of 
social order and political virtue sat glumly at the front of each aisle, back 
to the stage and face to the crowd, throughout every performance. 
</P>
<P>
There had been no defections from the Kirov ranks, although, as fate would have 
it, a single member of the auxiliary corps would seek asylum a few days later. 
Nevertheless, one sensed unrest in depth. 
</P>
<P>
It was no secret that some of the dancers were suffering injuries. They were 
unaccustomed, we were told, to our unraked stages. Members of the company, on 
various levels, were also complaining indiscreetly of a classic Western malady 
that results from the insulting combination of overwork and underpay. 
</P>
<P>
At least one comrade, a flamboyant would-be superstar named Farukh Ruzimatov, 
sent word that he would grant interviews only if properly remunerated for his 
extra-terpsichorean efforts. The evil capitalist system apparently corrupts 
quickly, and in surprising ways. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of advance announcements, Vinogradov had been altering repertory 
details and shuffling his roster right up to curtain time. Customers who had 
expected to see a specific senior ballerina in a central role often ended up, 
for better or worse, seeing a talented but obscure novice instead. One couldn't 
invariably tell the players even with a program. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the vexing matter of a scratchy American orchestra in the pit. 
Urged onward if not upward by an indulgent pair of Kirov maestros, the local 
pick-up band often seemed to be sight-reading the complex scores at hand, and 
not very accurately at that. 
</P>
<P>
Making diplomatic relations even more precarious, New York mustered no children 
for the lavish new production of "Sleeping Beauty." A highly placed spokeswoman 
at the Met explained that Kirov authorities had simply forgotten to request the 
hippety-hopping kids. Vinogradov claimed that the host organization had refused 
to recruit them. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
A model of cooperative bonhomie both in Vancouver and Los Angeles two years 
ago, Vinogradov was now dodging interviews. Igor Stupnikov, his trusty 
aide-de-camp and official (often superfluous) translator, cited no 
recrimination on the director's part, just conflicting professional exigencies. 
</P>
<P>
Backstage observers speculated, however, that he found the opportunity of doing 
some fancy shopping or taking in a Manhattan boat tour more appealing than the 
prospect of dealing with inquisitive American reporters. In a way, at least one 
inquisitive reporter couldn't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
Appointments, in any case, were habitually scheduled, postponed, canceled, 
forgotten, remembered and rescheduled. At one last-ditch encounter, the 
beleaguered boss found himself confronted by two rival interrogators at the 
same potentially awkward time. 
</P>
<P>
He avoided what might have become an awkward contretemps by promising -- really 
promising -- to talk to one journalist immediately and inviting the second, now 
understandably skeptical, to return for a private conversation the next night, 
same time, same place. All, for the moment, was well. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost all. 
</P>
<P>
The Official Version 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov sits behind a makeshift desk in a large dressing room backstage at 
the Met. Dark, thin and chronically intense, he looks weary but younger than 
his 51 years. He also looks forbidding -- at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Glowering, just a little, he motions his intrepid visitor to a chair. The 
visitor obeys. The ubiquitous translator follows suit. 
</P>
<P>
The table top is covered with cans of spray paint, bits of colored paper, 
assorted crayons and sticks of chalk. Vinogradov, who fidgets with his tools as 
he talks, likes to dabble in art. To these eyes, he dabbles deftly if a bit 
kitschily. 
</P>
<P>
He has designed the decors for some of the items in the current repertory. His 
pretty drawings and sketches -- usually of balletic subjects -- have been 
exhibited, and sometimes sold, in theaters where the Kirov has appeared. A 
well-informed rumor monger speculates that relations with the Met sponsors 
began to become tense when the New Yorkers resisted an invitation to display 
Vinogradov's illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the somber atmosphere surrounding the Lincoln Center 
engagement, Vinogradov denies the existence, even the possibility, of any 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Problems?" he repeats rhetorically. "We have absolutely no problems." He has 
introduced his favorite adverb. 
</P>
<P>
He pauses for qualification. "Of course, life with a company like ours cannot 
always be ideal. We are a big family. It is normal that some things 
occasionally go wrong. But there are no problems. Absolutely none." 
</P>
<P>
One suspects the gentleman protests too much. He squints into a distant 
invisible horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"The public response," he volunteers, "has been good. The press has been very 
good, very objective. Most of the remarks have been quite correct and to the 
point." 
</P>
<P>
He admits with a sigh that some Canadian interviewers had annoyed him. "They 
asked who Mr. Kirov was, and when he formed the company. Can you imagine? I had 
to explain to these newspaper people that they should read some books. But New 
York isn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
So he isn't unhappy about anything? 
</P>
<P>
The frown turns into a soulful scowl. "Unhappy?" He repeats the word in 
staccato English. Then he reverts to mellifluous Russian. "Why should I be 
unhappy about anything?" 
</P>
<P>
The subject is closed. 
</P>
<P>
'So Much Has Changed' 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov thaws. The dour facade fades as he talks about his charges. The 
proud paterfamilias emerges. 
</P>
<P>
"So much has changed," he says, "since we were last in America. 
</P>
<P>
"We have danced Balanchine at last. We have had a dancer from American Ballet 
Theatre, your Susan Jaffe, as a guest in 'Don Quixote.' We have sent three 
dancers to American Ballet Theatre. (Two of them, Altynai Assylmuratova and her 
husband Konstantin Zaklinsky, appeared in "Swan Lake" at the Shrine earlier 
this season.) 
</P>
<P>
"(Natalia) Makarova has been able to return to our stage. Baryshnikov has been 
invited. We always have been adventurous, I think, but we can be more openly 
adventurous now. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new generation of dancers. The younger ones dominate now. You will 
see some wonderful girls from the class of (Ninella) Kurgapkina." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the boys? 
</P>
<P>
"What about the boys?" 
</P>
<P>
Some experts, the interviewer nervously responds, have complained that the 
Kirov women, whether in the corps de ballet or in central roles, outdance their 
male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Vinogradov agrees. "The men are weaker." His frankness startles. 
</P>
<P>
Then it is diluted as he paraphrases Balanchine. "The foundation of ballet is 
the woman. This is not a football team. The position is the same in all 
companies of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, perhaps, Vinogradov has brought to New York only one ballet of his 
own devising: "Battleship Potemkin." It utilizes an ultra-athletic, virtually 
all-male cast. 
</P>
<P>
It also turns out to be a quaintly dated demonstration of socialist-realism 
melodrama ornamented with grand group-grope gestures. After a series of 
cartoonish exercises alternating with sticky pas de deux involving the grim 
reaper and various victims, a horde of beef-caky sailors rip off their uniform 
tops, emit a lusty unison yell, and, at last savoring the exhilaration of 
mutiny, dash into the audience and up the aisle to the foyer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a swarm of toy sea gulls on strings descends from the lurid sky on a 
blood-red stage. The curtain falls to the thumps of a mock-romantic score by 
Alexander Tchaikovsky (no relation to you-know-who) that would dishonor 1930s 
movie-music. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is exactly subtle. But it may tell us what revolutionary modernism 
looks and sounds like in contemporary Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Why, one wonders, was "Potemkin" seen only in New York? 
</P>
<P>
"It is too cumbersome," Vinogradov explains, with obvious regret. "The set is 
rather complex, and the navy on the stage enlists 30 extra sailors who are not 
normally in our corps." 
</P>
<P>
This brings up the perennial double standard for touring companies in America. 
What is good enough for New York is often better than what the rest of the 
country gets. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians were disappointed when it was learned that the Costa Mesa 
season would not include the epochal Balanchine ballets recently performed at 
the Kirov Theater and at the Met. Balanchine, it will be remembered, began his 
career in Leningrad and became an anathema at home while he achieved balletic 
sainthood in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At first Vinogradov seems surprised to be told that "Theme and Variations" and 
"Scotch Symphony" are not planned for the West Coast. He dutifully checks his 
own records, then nods gravely. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought you were sick and tired of Balanchine," he jests. "Anyhow, Orange 
County asked for the bigger productions." 
</P>
<P>
Who makes the final decisions regarding what goes on the road? 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov waves aside the stupid question before it can be translated. "I 
decide," he says, pointing dramatically to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes an enigmatic afterthought. "Perhaps I will surprise you." 
</P>
<P>
As we go to press, it appears that at least half a Balanchine surprise may come 
true. One performance of "Theme and Variations" will be added to the local 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Playing to Americans 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov likes surprises, whether they involve repertory or casting. He also 
savors flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
"When I decide who will perform," he says, "I take into consideration the 
situation of the moment. We have five or six dancers for each role. We try to 
rotate opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, many of the most prominent opportunities fell to Galina 
Mezentseva, a rather brittle ballerina obviously more popular in the Soviet 
Union than here. Americans have been far more responsive to the lyrical 
expansion of Altynai Assylmuratova and the bravura grandeur of Tatiana 
Terekhova (who appeared fleetingly in Orange County last season with the Moscow 
Classical Ballet). 
</P>
<P>
"C'est la vie," says Vinogradov. "It is a matter of taste. Mezentseva is a very 
talented dancer. She may have some technical problems, but she can exert a 
great influence over the audience." 
</P>
<P>
At the final Kirov performance in Los Angeles two years ago, Vinogradov came 
before the Shrine Auditorium curtain to introduce a lavish series of unexpected 
encores. Mezentseva expired twice as the Dying Swan. 
</P>
<P>
"The public liked all of this," he recalls. "I could feel it in the air. 
Sometimes it is absolutely necessary to improvise." 
</P>
<P>
Since the added numbers required music on the stands in the pit, not to mention 
dancers in premeditated costumes, one had to wonder just how spontaneous 
Vinogradov's last-minute decisions can be. 
</P>
<P>
He grins mischievously as he recalls the occasion, and speaks in English. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'One more?' They clap and say 'yes.' I say, 'What you want?' They say 
'modern.' " 
</P>
<P>
He even harbors happy memories of the cavernous Shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget it," he says. "It was one of the strongest impressions of 
my life. Six thousand people told us that they loved us. The big stage was 
nice. Our corps needs space. I don't like small stages. The atmosphere was OK, 
and the audience was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
And what about Segerstrom Hall, the incipient home away from home for the 
Kirov? 
</P>
<P>
"It is splendid. Absolutely. I visited it some months ago, and was impressed. I 
only wish you used raked stages here. That would be better for everyone, the 
dancers and the public too." 
</P>
<P>
Several names that drew popular attention here in 1986 are missing from the 
current prospectus. It is explained that Olga Chenchikova, remembered as a 
marvelously heroic Odette/Odile, is on maternity leave. Evgeny Kolobov, the 
fiery conductor, has moved on to a new post in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov becomes pensive and evasive at the mention of young Alexander Lunev, 
who had seemed a likely successor to the tragically lamented Yuri Soloviev. 
</P>
<P>
"Lunev is ailing. He has a serious disease. His career may be in jeopardy. We 
miss him." 
</P>
<P>
Requests for more specific information are rejected. "It is not appropriate to 
talk of this," says Vinogradov. Backstage sources suggest, however, that Lunev 
may suffer from alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika and Dance 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov emphatically welcomes the recent changes in the Soviet perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"The tours are easier now because of the change. It has become easier to live 
and breathe within the company. We managed to present contemporary ballets, by 
Bejart and Roland Petit and many young Russians, long before it was 
fashionable. You might say that perestroika came to the Kirov before it came to 
the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we still have to deal with officialdom. The bureaucracy still 
can be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The bureaucracy has not precluded open visits, even negotiations, with some 
illustrious Kirov defectors. 
</P>
<P>
"Makarova's return to us was very emotional for everyone. The tension was 
absolutely incredible. She spent all the time with us here in New York, until 
she left today for London. She was at all the performances. We hope she will 
come to Leningrad again. 
</P>
<P>
"Nureyev came and watched for a whole day. It made us all happy. These things 
would have been unthinkable before." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as is hoped, Mikhail Baryshnikov will bring his American Ballet 
Theatre to Leningrad in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I have something to offer him," Vinogradov says. "But he seems evasive. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a good joint venture. The company remembers him, likes him. There 
are good feelings. An exchange of some sort would be very useful. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can meet. We have not discussed our plans in detail. I have the 
feeling Baryshnikov does not want very much to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no reasons for this. Perhaps this is a difficult time for him. He 
just had a child. He has resigned from his post. I am told that there were 
difficulties with his 'Swan Lake.' 
</P>
<P>
"He lives his life as he must. He would be welcome in Leningrad at any moment. 
I have also invited him to dance at a gala celebrating the 100th birthday of 
Nijinsky on Dec. 20, 1989. So far no answer." 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov is moody, a visitor volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"He is Russian," confirms Vinogradov. He grins knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
'Our Door Is Open' 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov, like the moody Baryshnikov, is no stranger to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, the critics form cliques," he laments. "Very often, a critic 
expresses the ideas of a specific camp. There is one camp in Leningrad that 
likes me, another that thinks I am ruining the Kirov. For them I can do nothing 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they do not like me because I do my own business my own way. I am 
subservient to no one. I pay no attention, and go on doing what I think is 
right. (Yuri) Grigorovich faces similar problems at the Bolshoi. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the critics in Leningrad are former dancers or, worst of all, dancers 
whom I have protested and fired. They write out of revenge. Others are merely 
dilettantes." 
</P>
<P>
Vinogradov recently caused a small stir at home when he censored the annotation 
prepared for Balanchine's "Scotch Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
"The article was shown to me too late. I could ask for no changes, so I decided 
that having no program would be better than having this program. The critic who 
wrote the article was expressing his own thoughts as if they came from 
Balanchine. They were dubious thoughts, and this was a young critic. That made 
it worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Leningrad audience, he finds, is often more open to novelty than is the 
press. "Some critics want nothing to change, ever. I want many things to 
change, and I think much of the public is on my side." 
</P>
<P>
He is eager to have more of what he regards as experimental dance in Leningrad, 
even though there seem to be some gaps in his knowledge of the avant garde. He 
professes no knowledge of Mark Morris, but great interest in Martha Graham and 
Jerome Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the Kirov to be separated from the rest of the world any more," 
he exclaims. "Our door is open. It is open to choreographers and to dancers. I 
am not sure, however, if the United States really wants to send them." 
</P>
<P>
The historic but hasty guest appearance by Susan Jaffe apparently did not run 
as smoothly as one might have wished. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a success, even though there were difficult moments. She was a bit 
capricious. There were problems in her adapting to our production. She danced 
only one performance. Still, I want to try this sort of exchange regularly." 
</P>
<P>
By a similar token, he wouldn't mind seeing more of his own work on foreign 
stages. His most recent effort was a daring and distinctly individual version 
of "Petrushka" staged for the Scottish Ballet in Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
"I used an all-new libretto, different personages. I departed from tradition in 
every way, although of course I retained the Stravinsky score. There was no 
trace of Fokine. I made it a ballet about glasnost and perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
This revisionist "Petrushka" may lack a straw-clown hero, but the choreographer 
insists that it retains its theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I do," says Oleg Vinogradov, is very theatrical. Absolutely."

ON THE RECORD: MUSIC FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc-Antoine Charpentier's harmonic vision, his ability to create splendid 
contrasts between his vocal and instrumental forces, were part of a revolution 
in French music that took place a century before the more celebrated (and 
bloody) social and political Revolution of 1789. 
</P>
<P>
The glories of Charpentier's style are exemplified in his 1692 "Te Deum," at 
once music with the trumpets-and-drums swagger we associate with the Court of 
Versailles and a work of the sweetest Italianate lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of the "Te Deum," as centerpiece of a program of the composer's 
liturgical works (on Harmonia Mundi France 901298), is by the vocal and 
period-instrumental forces of Les Arts Florissants under the direction of 
William Christie, who produced results that are both admirable for their 
scholarship and irresistible for their joyous energy. 
</P>
<P>
Among the music that was making the rounds at the time of the storming of the 
Bastille was that of Etienne-Nicolas Mehul (1763-1817), whose four symphonies 
are played by the Gulbenkian Foundation Orchestra of Lisbon under Michel 
Swierczewski on a pair of Nimbus CDs (5184/5). 
</P>
<P>
On present evidence, Mehul's most noteworthy quality, aside from the 
aimlessness of his slow movements, is his general disdain for French models in 
favor, variously, of Haydn, Weber, Rossini and particularly Mozart and 
Beethoven, whose G-minor (K. 550) and Fifth Symphonies, respectively, are 
tediously constant -- if not necessarily conscious -- points of reference. 
</P>
<P>
It was as a composer of operas that the Italian-born Luigi Cherubini found 
favor in his adopted French homeland around the time of the Revolution. But 
while there are occasional revivals of his 'Medee" and "Anacreon" in Europe, 
Cherubini's broader reputation today is based on Beethoven's admiration for his 
works (the feeling was not reciprocated), for his having instructed an 
ungrateful Berlioz in the rigors of counterpoint, and for writing a series of 
powerful, if severe, works for chorus and orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The best known of these is the Requiem in C minor commissioned in 1817 to 
commemorate Louis XVI's execution by guillotine a quarter-century earlier. It 
is scored for mixed chorus (without soloists) and a late-Beethoven-sized 
orchestra with the addition of bass trombone and tam-tam, both used to stunning 
effect in the "Dies Irae." 
</P>
<P>
The Requiem, which has past identifications with Arturo Toscanini and Carlo 
Maria Giulini, has now been entrusted to the less exalted hands of the young 
East German conductor Claus Peter Flor, who nevertheless leads it with 
commanding sensitivity. His Berlin Symphony makes a brave sound, and the Berlin 
Radio Chorus is well balanced and accurate. The live-performance recording is 
gorgeously lifelike (RCA 60059). 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Cherubini, Berlioz did not disdain martial pomp, as witness his 
"Symphonie funebre et triomphale," written in 1840 to celebrate the 10th 
anniversary of the July Revolution that toppled the absolutist regime of 
Charles X. 
</P>
<P>
In his memoirs, Berlioz recalls the disastrous premiere, which found him 
conducting a military band of 200 musicians while walking backwards -- Berlioz, 
not the band -- along one of Paris' main boulevards toward the Place de la 
Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
"As we were marching," Berlioz writes, "nothing could be made out more than 10 
yards away. Finally, the National Guard, tired of standing in the blazing sun 
in the Place de la Bastille, began to march off to the accompaniment of some 50 
side drums maintaining a relentless barrage throughout the Apotheosis" (the 
symphony's rabble-rousing finale). 
</P>
<P>
"That," he continues, "is how they regard the role of public occasions in 
France: By all means let it figure as an attraction -- for the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to hear this music is on recordings, particularly when 
presented as lustily as it is (on Nimbus 5175) by British trumpeter/conductor 
John Wallace and his 60-odd member wind ensemble, the Wallace Collection. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace augments the Berlioz with band music from the (first) Revolutionary 
period by Gossec, Cherubini and Rouget de Lisle, his "Hymne a la liberte" -- a 
k a "La Marseillaise" -- in Wallace's arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The last-named is sung with appropriate abandon, in a language purported to be 
French, by the Leeds Festival Chorus, which also adds its obscure mouthings to 
the "Symphonie funebre."

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: GALWAY AWAITING NEWS ON STOLEN FLUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I've not heard a thing," says the familiar voice in that unmistakable brogue. 
</P>
<P>
On the phone from Lucerne, Switzerland, James Galway refers to the theft of 
five gold flutes from his luggage the day he returned home to Switzerland from 
his summer tour of the United States late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Irish flutist has since offered a reward -- 10% of the value of the 
instruments (500,000 Swiss francs or $303,350 American, with no questions 
asked) -- he has gotten no response. 
</P>
<P>
Four of them were custom-produced by the Japanese flute maker Muramatsu. These 
four have hand-engraved ornamentation, and three are decorated with diamond 
studs at the head of the instrument. The fifth flute is the handiwork of the 
Boston craftsman Dana Sheridan, whom Galway calls "one of the best of the young 
American flute makers." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their uniqueness, the 49-year-old musician says, these instruments 
cannot safely be bought or sold publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"And, because they are an alloy, only 14 karat, they would not be worth much if 
melted down. Whoever took them must be an idiot. His only hope, probably, is to 
negotiate with me and the insurance company." 
</P>
<P>
Galway said the flutes were in an inexpensive black nylon bag to disguise the 
valuable flutes inside. When he and his wife, Jeannie, arrived at the Lucerne 
train station July 26, they were met by family members and carried their 
luggage -- with the flutes -- in two hand trolleys. When they arrived home, the 
black bag was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Galway said he reported the loss to the police but "I won't prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Galway says, he has "one of my old favorites, from the distant 
past, actually, the flute I played on at my debut at Hollywood Bowl," for 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
And next week, he announces, "Mr. Muramatsu has promised to deliver three new 
gold flutes to me. How's that for service?" 
</P>
<P>
What if the stolen flutes re-appear? 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Muramatsu can sell them." 
</P>
<P>
BRIEFLY: Before their appearance at "Black Choreographers" festivals in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles in October and November, the modern dance company 
Donald Byrd/The Group gives performances in Budapest, Hungary, and Budva, 
Yugoslavia. The 12-dancer troupe, with artistic director Byrd and auxiliary 
personnel, leaves for Eastern Europe today. On its way back to New York, it 
will give performances in The Hague and Amsterdam. . . . At the four pops 
concerts to be conducted by Murry Sidlin Aug. 30-Sept. 2 at Hospitality Point, 
the San Diego Symphony will play programs selected -- on the spot -- by 
audiences attending the concerts. Each concert concludes with fireworks. . . . 
Twelve positions, including principal percussion for one season only, have been 
announced by the Inland Empire Symphony. Auditions will be held Sept. 15-17, 
but applications must be received by Sept. 4. Write John Gates, personnel 
manager, Inland Empire Symphony auditions, 362 W. Court St., San Bernardino 
92041. Positions are: concertmaster, principal viola, principal flute, 
principal percussion (1989-90 only), section violin (five positions), section 
viola (two positions) and section bass (one position). 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Mstislav Rostropovich has joined the campaign to save the elephants. 
The cellist and music director of the National Symphony will give a recital in 
the Concert Hall of the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington Sept. 18, with 
proceeds benefiting elephant conservation projects of the Animal Welfare 
Institute and the African Wildlife Foundation. . . . Composer/conductor 
Victoria Bond, who is music director of the Roanoke (Va.) Symphony, is writing 
a cantata based on the one-man theater piece, "Thoreau Tonight," and using the 
words of pioneer environmentalist Henry David Thoreau. . . . Gregory Osborne, a 
principal of the National Ballet of Canada, has left the company to pursue 
free-lance work. During 1989-90, Osborne will make solo guest appearances with 
the San Francisco Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. He will also return to 
his former home company for performances of "Swan Lake," "Giselle" and 
"Voluntaries." . . . Musicologist Michael Steinberg has joined the staff of the 
Minnesota Orchestra as artistic adviser to music director Edo de Waart. Until 
recently, Steinberg held a comparable post at the San Francisco Symphony.

MONTY ALEXANDER'S LIFE ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the elements common to West Indian music and American jazz, very few 
musicians from the Islands have achieved any measure of prominence in the 
United States. Among those few, pianist Monty Alexander has made the most 
significant and durable impact. 
</P>
<P>
The charming Jamaican accent he brought with him when he arrived in the U.S. in 
1961 (he had just turned 17) has never left him, but the Caribbean flavor in 
his music ebbs and flows according to the company he keeps. 
</P>
<P>
"I still like to get together with musicians who are into that whole Caribbean 
experience," he said recently during a visit to Los Angeles. "I've been doing 
this thing I call Ivory and Steel, working with steel drummers. And I toured 
Europe recently with a wonderful bass player named David Williams, a 
full-fledged Trinidadan who grew up among Calypsonians like Lord Kitchener and 
the Mighty Sparrow. But I have an equally good time with this group." 
</P>
<P>
"This group" is the trio known as Triple Treat, the other two thirds being 
bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. Working with them is something of a 
dream come true for Alexander, one of whose early idols was Oscar Peterson, 
with whom both Brown and Ellis worked for years. 
</P>
<P>
His American career began soon after his mother, looking for a better social 
situation, left Kingston to bring him and his younger brother to Miami. "I had 
studied privately in Jamaica, and I had fond memories of Nat King Cole." 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, Alexander gravitated toward what he calls "the Bohemian worlds" of 
music and boxing. "I'd go to the gym and watch all the boxers train. Later in 
New York, Miles Davis and I went to Madison Square Garden to see the fights." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere among Miami's later night haunts, Alexander met Steve Stark, whose 
father, Herman Stark, had been one of the original operators of the Cotton Club 
during its Duke Ellington glory days. "Steve thought I had potential, but I 
needed a green card to work. Well, we went to New York and visited Duke's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"He told Duke my situation and had me play for him. Duke wrote and signed a 
letter saying I was an outstanding talent and I should be important in the 
United States. I wish I had a copy of that letter. Anyhow, thanks to Duke the 
immigration people were satisfied. Today I'm a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
The aura of Nat King Cole and Cannonball Adderley, both natives of Tampa, and 
Sam Jones, Adderley's bassist, made a heavy impression on jazzmen in Florida. 
"We had some real heavy, swingin' roots going on down there. But when I got a 
job on the road, it was with a dance band -- Art Mooney, who had a big hit with 
'I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover.' He had a hotel in Hollywood, Fla., where 
I was accompanying a belly dancer -- oh, I'll never forget Princess Naila -- 
and he decided I should leave her and go with his band to Reno." 
</P>
<P>
After the job ended in Reno, it was desperation time for a while. "I can play 
bass, so I borrowed some guy's Fender and took a job on bass, backing up a 
singer. Then I went to Las Vegas, where I was at loose ends when one night at 
the Thunderbird and here come Frank Sinatra and his friend, Jilly Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
"I had met them before in Miami. Jilly said, 'You're the guy I saw in Florida. 
We've got to get you to come to my club in New York.' Well, I thought maybe it 
was just late night chatter, but a week later, there was a plane ticket in the 
mail." 
</P>
<P>
The move turned out to be a wise one as word spread about the prodigious young 
pianist from the Islands. Alexander met drummer Mickey Roker, who sent 
vibraphonist Milt Jackson to hear him; he met Ray Brown, and one night during a 
spell in Hollywood got to play with Brown at the end of a long night of 
jamming. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like magic -- from the first moment we started playing, we got that 
thing going, you know?" He snapped his fingers to demonstrate. "After just one 
tune, we got off the bandstand and Ray said, 'Where are you gonna be in July? I 
want you to come and play with me and Milt Jackson.' " 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, Alexander circulated among the big boys, in fact became one 
of them. He played several summer seasons with Jackson and Brown, led his own 
trio for a European tour in 1974 and recorded regularly. 
</P>
<P>
His partnership with Brown and Ellis has continued off and on since 1982, when 
they taped a live album at a Tokyo club. When Triple Treat is not working, he 
may be reminding himself of his Jamaican roots by composing such tunes as 
"Happy Lypso" and "Reggae-Later" or working out arrangements of folk songs such 
as "Sly Mongoose" and "Linstead Market." His original "Accompong" was dedicated 
to the Maroons, runaway slaves who escaped from British soldiers and settled in 
the Jamaican town of Accompong in the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
On these works, his recordings feature the steel drums of Othello Molineaux and 
Len (Boogsie) Sharp, both natives of Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
A third aspect of his career finds him paying tribute to Nat King Cole; he has 
worked out a night club set in which he sings and plays tunes associated with 
Cole's early years and his own childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Today," he says in summation, "I'm as busy as I can be, as a traveling 
musician. I feel a need for variety in my work, and I'm lucky to be in a 
position where I can pick and choose."

RECORD RACK: STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN &amp; DOUBLE TROUBLE "IN STEP." EPIC ***:

As the last big discovery by the late John Hammond, Vaughan rightly dedicates 
his latest effort to the pioneering record producer and talent scout who died 
two years ago. Vaughan hopscotches between the blues, jazz and rock that his 
benefactor mined so successfully in discoveries from Benny Goodman and Billie 
Holiday to Dylan and Springsteen. Vaughan doesn't take any quantum leaps beyond 
the raucous roadhouse blues and rock he has traversed already in three studio 
albums and one live recording, but he can still set fire to a guitar quicker 
than you can say "Jack Flash." The closing tune, "Riviera Paradise," seems 
designed to show that Vaughan can shine in low gear as well as overdrive, but 
the nearly 9-minute, moody excursion waffles between introspective blues and 
lazy lounge jazz, falling too often on the snoozy side of the street. Mostly, 
though, it's blazing business as usual. RANDY LEWIS

RECORD RACK: BABYFACE "TENDER LOVER." SOLAR ***: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF

The best track here, "Soon as I Get Home," is an idealized "good man" answer to 
Karyn White's "Superwoman," the crossover smash that Babyface and his producing 
partner L.A. Reid wrote for her. Babyface comes off as the answer to every 
girl's prayer: caring, generous to a fault, true blue and too good to be true. 
With his matinee-idol looks and suave way with cool tunes like "My Kinda Girl" 
and "Whip Appeal" (which is far tamer than the title implies), Babyface -- who 
also records as the lead singer of the group the Deele -- stands poised to make 
an impact as this year's black music heartthrob. Some of the cuts on his debut 
LP are as chart-worthy as hits he and Reid have supplied for Bobby Brown, the 
Whispers and Pebbles -- listen to the way he goes for broke and sings as if 
he's got a point to prove on "Where Will You Go," the closing track. Babyface 
doesn't sound like someone content with being a mere group member or a producer 
of hits for other singers. Image intact and armed with a few good songs, he 
appears ready to go the solo distance. CONNIE JOHNSON

RECORD RACK: YOUSSOU N'DOUR. "THE LION." VIRGIN **:ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE

<P>
N'Dour's association with Peter Gabriel and the Amnesty International tour 
caused the Senegalese vocalist to become the most visible African musician to 
the international pop audience, but "The Lion" stumbles badly. 
</P>
<P>
Dominated by keyboards and percussion, the arrangements fashioned by producers 
George Acogny, David Sancious and Gabriel (on one track) strive for an 
appealingly spooky atmosphere but only occasionally succeed. The lack of 
definable hooks reduces the music to a luxuriant wash of sound that often 
buries N'Dour's vocals. 
</P>
<P>
The one outstanding track here is "Old Tucson," where an intricate arrangement 
is solidly anchored by Habib Faye's sonorous bass and the nagging guitar of Pap 
Omar Ngom. N'Dour's rougher "Immigres" album (recorded in 1984 but released in 
America last year) is a superior record -- not because it's more "authentic" 
but because it crackles with the personality missing on "The Lion." DON SNOWDEN

RECORD RACK: RICKY SKAGGS. "KENTUCKY THUNDER." EPIC. ** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED

As a singer, Skaggs has always been a lot like Clark Kent: mild-mannered, 
eminently likable -- and harmless. Lacking the powers of vocal Supermen like 
George Jones and Randy Travis, Skaggs runs into trouble with many of this 
album's hackneyed stories and allusions. "The Fields of Home" dredges up every 
hokey, tear-inducing gimmick this side of Old Shep. The title tune, with its 
compendium of cliches about the Bluegrass State, poses no threat to displace 
Bill Monroe's "Blue Moon of Kentucky" as the state song. Skaggs is at his best 
when he keeps it light and lively, as in Sonny Curtis' witty "He Was Onto 
Somethin' (So He Made You)." The musicianship, as expected from Skaggs and his 
top-drawer associates, is sterling throughout, but it's still not enough to 
rescue most of these songs from the clutches of banality. RANDY LEWIS

NOTEBOOK: CAJUN: THE APPLE OF HIS EYE IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Cajun cooking dead? Maybe so -- but the man who launched (however 
unwillingly) the Cajun craze, Paul Prudhomme, is still very much alive -- and 
still cooking very lively Cajun. In fact, he has just opened a new version of 
his legendary New Orleans restaurant, K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen -- on lower 
Broadway in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Prudhomme says that the goal of the Manhattan K-Paul's -- which is a joint 
venture between himself and the Ark Restaurant Corp. -- is "to show off 
Louisiana cooking as we know it in Louisiana." To that end, Prudhomme has 
closed his New Orleans restaurant until Aug. 28, and has moved some 45 
employees to Manhattan to help set up the new place. A number will remain 
permanently -- including K-Paul's mainstays Andrew Humbert as chef and Sandy 
Torres as dining room manager. 
</P>
<P>
Prudhomme will remain in New York until Aug. 26, he says, and then plans to 
return at least one week out of every six. The menu? "In New Orleans," says 
Prudhomme, "whatever we find every day by noon goes on the menu for that night 
-- and we plan to do the same thing here. We already have a wholesale seafood 
business set up, so we're able to ship whatever we buy in New Orleans up to New 
York every morning. And, we're also going to look for products unique to New 
York and ship them back in the other direction." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is open Monday through Friday only. Lunch isn't served, but 
Prudhomme offers what he calls a "neighborhood theater menu" from 4 to 7 p.m., 
followed by a regular dinner menu from 7 to 11 p.m. As at the New Orleans 
restaurant, service is strictly first-come, first-serve, with no reservations 
accepted. Prudhomme adds that he hopes to be able to keep prices to something 
approximating their New Orleans level -- with entrees priced at about $12-$18 
until 7 p.m., and $22-$28 afterward. "People in New York tell me I can't do 
that and make money," he says, "but I don't believe 'em." 
</P>
<P>
But why a New York restaurant now? Isn't the timing a bit off? Won't jaded 
Gothamites yawn at the thought of another hunk of blackened tuna? "There's no 
doubt that a lot of restaurants that call themselves Cajun are closing down," 
Prudhomme answers, "but that makes me happy, because most of them were pretty 
bad to begin with. At the same time, there are still two or three Cajun dishes 
on menus all over the country today. I think a lot of people who can't really 
handle a whole Cajun restaurant can still make two or three dishes pretty well. 
And I think that, if we're ever going to have a real American cuisine, that's 
the way it's going to be built -- with two or three dishes from here and two or 
three from there." 
</P>
<P>
SECOND HELPINGS: In the matter of the obligatory service charge at Michael's in 
Santa Monica, recently lowered from 18% to 15%: Jimmy Schmidt, chef-owner of 
the Rattlesnake Club in Detroit and former partner of Michael's boss Michael 
McCarty in that restaurant and two more Rattlesnakes (now called Adirondacks) 
in Denver and Washington, D.C., has dropped his own obligatory service charge 
completely. "Our customers want to figure out the tip themselves," he says. He 
adds that when the Denver Rattlesnake first instituted a service charge, about 
a year-and-a-half ago, business dropped 27% in the first month. (McCarty 
disputes Schmidt's figure, incidentally -- and points out that, anyway, 
December is almost every restaurant's busiest month while January is 
traditionally a slow one, so a drop in business at that time of year would be 
normal, and not necessarily a response to other factors.) . . . And in 
describing Jean Bellordre merely as the chef at the just-closed Le Cellier in 
Santa Monica, I did him a disservice: Since the restaurant's opening almost 20 
years ago, he has been both head chef and a partner in the restaurant's 
management.

YOUTH IN VENICE'S OAKWOOD GHETTO BASE PRODUCTIONS OF THE PEARL WHITE THEATRE ON 
THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sudden violence was all too typical for hot Westside nights. Shoreline 
Crips, wearing trademark blue bandannas and trench coats, were stomping and 
beating their rivals with lethal precision. 
</P>
<P>
Blood erupted from shattered mouths. An onlooker shouted, "Stop it!" 
</P>
<P>
The gang members were performing in a play titled "Boredom" in an auditorium at 
Santa Monica Hospital. The realistic blood was courtesy of the show's sponsor, 
actor Beau Bridges, who watched the action along with an audience of students, 
police, doctors, social workers, nurses and, in the auditorium's last row, the 
Rolling 60s -- deadly foes of the Shoreline Crips. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling 60s did not applaud. Instead, their hands came together in gang 
signs, challenging the on-stage Crips to real combat. But the performers 
ignored the challenge and improvised a rap dance in response to the taunts. 
</P>
<P>
"Instantaneously, they turned the anger into music and dance," said director 
Melvyn Hayward. "I was never so proud of anything in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"One time!" 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, this warning cry, street slang for police, alerted a 
cluster of crack dealers and users to flee an alley off Washington Boulevard in 
Venice. A squad car glided by, and those who fled soon returned. Music echoed 
faintly from the Venice Teen Post. At the nearby Pearl White Theatre for the 
Performing Arts, a storefront on Westminster Avenue, two 13 year-olds -- David 
Boyd and Sean Jones -- parked their bicycles and called out to Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
"Melvyn!? Can we bring our bikes in?" 
</P>
<P>
Hayward, co-director of the theater where Venice youth are encouraged to write, 
sing, dance and act in productions based on their experiences, signaled for the 
teen-agers to come in. Then the burly 40-year-old, dressed in torn sweats, 
resumed his passionate explanation of how "Boredom," which had been staged just 
a few weeks before in Santa Monica, was created. 
</P>
<P>
"Our themes are community related: AIDS, drug abuse, curfew, gangbanging, the 
police. We always do them first for our community and our performances are 
always free. We rehearse three or four months. I know I take a lot from the 
kids, but then they give so much back to the community. And when the community 
sees them, people start feeling self respect." 
</P>
<P>
During the course of an interview, Hayward used the word "respect" many times. 
</P>
<P>
"People out there, they respect the Pearl White Theatre. They don't smoke in 
here, they don't drink in here, they don't come in loaded." 
</P>
<P>
The Pearl White Theatre for the Performing Arts is an imposing title for the 
narrow, cluttered storefront on the edge of Venice's Oakwood ghetto. The slab 
concrete floor is covered by two shag carpets. Third-hand furniture, sports 
trophies and photographs of Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson help make 
it a home to local youth. The number of teen-agers who participate varies from 
production to production. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any money," Hayward said. "Everything we got was donated. Here 
we are a theater group, and we don't even have a camera. We pay for our own 
lights, plumbing. We got mismatched broken furniture. We use beat-up P.A. 
systems. No microphones. We don't have anything. The only thing we have is us." 
</P>
<P>
Hayward and his actors rehearse in the storefront, but the plays are staged at 
various schools and institutions -- Cal State Los Angeles, Venice High School, 
Santa Monica Hospital -- that invite the company to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unpretentious style and crude furnishings, the Pearl White Theatre 
is as accomplished as the average community theater. Hayward and his 
co-director, former gang member Robert Shipp, are creating a new play, "Youth 
and Police," and preparing a performance for today's sixth annual Venice Summer 
Arts and Crafts Festival, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on West Washington Boulevard 
between Venice Boulevard and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is open to anyone who walks in off the street, even has a 
theatrical angel. Co-founder Beau Bridges, who attended Venice High School, 
donates equipment and rent money and attends performances. He also has acted in 
and directed company productions. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges says he's kept a low profile "because I wanted the young people to have 
a body of work that would speak for themselves. I've stayed away from public 
relations because I think young people who are not aware of the media can get 
swept away by it. I wanted it to be a community-oriented organization that 
could generate its own power." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hayward, "Beau don't try to chump us. Beau is real. For a white dude he's 
a coldblooded dude. We call him Bo Diddley. He is real and he love us with his 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Among the company's "graduates" are Mark Booker, who appeared in "Colors," and 
John Bay who acted in "Weeds." 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much beautiful talent in this community," Hayward said, "and I aim 
to find it and let it shine." 
</P>
<P>
During the day, Hayward works as a youth counselor at the Didi Hirsch Community 
Mental Health Center in Culver City. But he's most eloquent about the Pearl 
White Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"We ain't gonna ever use no professional actors," he said. "In Venice we're on 
a stage everyday. We use what we got: ourselves. We get kids right out of the 
community who have had these things happen to them. And that way we get first 
hand information." 
</P>
<P>
The productions are meant to be therapeutic and educational. For example, 
Hayward said, when a curfew was being enforced in Venice, many of the 
neighborhood children didn't understand the law. Because some were raising 
themselves while avoiding drug-addicted parents, it made sense to stay out as 
late as possible. The streets, he said, were safer than home. 
</P>
<P>
"So we did a skit on curfew with the police department," Hayward said, adding 
that officers served as consultants to the production. "I even played one of 
the officers. This explained to the kids what it is the police are talking 
about when they say curfew." 
</P>
<P>
It also illustrated to the police why the children might disregard the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Wilbanks, commander of the LAPD's Pacific area, which takes in 
Venice, said that "generally the program is a real positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Hayward says the Pearl White storefront space gives kids a place to "hang" 
besides Oakwood's crack-dealing corner of 5th Street and Broadway Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community, an extended family," he said. "Everybody knows everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"All you hear about on the radio and read in the newspapers is crime. But a lot 
of positive things happen here. Pearl White, 
</P>
<P>
that's the most powerful person in Venice. I don't care if you meet a million 
people, you ain't met no one until you've met Pearl White." 
</P>
<P>
White, 70, is responsible for many community programs in Oakwood. While 
recovering from cancer in her mid-30s, White says she "dedicated myself to 
working for others. I guess I figured I didn't have much time left." 
</P>
<P>
White helped organize Venice's first Neighborhood Watch programs and met 
Hayward while working as a volunteer counselor at the Venice Drug Coalition. 
The theater that bears her name was started in 1978. (Hayward joined the group 
in 1982.) 
</P>
<P>
White continues to work with the theater and, in fact, played the title role in 
a holiday play called "Merry Christmas Sarah," saying: "They just put me in 
there even though I never had an acting lesson in my life." 
</P>
<P>
But White and her friends can't get around as they once did, which is where 
Hayward comes in. "Melvyn is our legs -- we can't get around like Melvyn." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hayward does it all without a driver's license. Indeed, he has 
never driven in his life, preferring to pedal throughout the Oakwood community 
on a bicycle. "I could parachute for the 82nd Airborne and play football for 
Santa Monica Junior College, but my knees start knocking the moment I get 
behind the wheel of a car," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward "networks" the bureaucratic jungle as easily as he maneuvers the 
streets of Oakwood. He works with various organizations including the Los 
Angeles Police Commission and county Supervisor Deane Dana's office. Marjorie 
Alatorre of the Venice Chamber of Commerce said: "Melvyn is trying to change 
the negative attitudes in the community. He's extremely dedicated to saving our 
kids. He's street smart and a very good role model." 
</P>
<P>
Hayward said: "You got to have a good relationship with the police. I work with 
all the people in the community. The police get mad cause I work with the ones 
they're after, but somebody got to deal with them, somebody got to reach them 
before they either get killed or end up killing one of the police officers. 
When people give up on you in the Oakwood area, I'm always around." 
</P>
<P>
Pacing the rehearsal room, he turned to 13-year-old Sean Jones and said, "I'm 
telling you, Sean, you can do anything you want to do. You can follow the one 
that's doing the wrong stuff or you can follow the right man. I always ran by 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
"I come in here because it's something to do," Sean said. "Sometimes we talk 
and sometimes we sit around and work on a play. Now we're working on a gang 
play and a play about jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Hayward grins and says: "I'm a big 40-year-old kid. The Lord guides my light. 
There seems to be a shield around me. People trust me, that's the key. I don't 
try to tell them how to run their life. I try to help them when they're at 
their lowest point. That's what you should do -- help a man when he's down."

BEER AND CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Grein's July 30 article, "Suds 'n' Bucks 'n' Rock 'n' Roll," cogently 
illustrates the beer makers' voracious appetite for profit and the "futures" 
market as they target the young by sponsoring rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
And kudos to retiring U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, quoted in the article, 
for his efforts to: (1) eliminate alcohol sponsorship of concerts and athletic 
contests where much of the audience is likely to be under the drinking age; (2) 
eliminate the use in alcohol ads of celebrities who appeal to youths, and (3) 
develop training for community groups in opposing alcohol ads. 
</P>
<P>
With "the prime concert audience and the prime beer-drinking market 
(overlapping) to a degree that is a marketer's dream" (as Grein wrote in 
referring to the 18-to-24-year-old bracket), small wonder that young people are 
continuing to self-destruct through vehicle crashes, homicide and suicide as 
their leading causes of death -- all alcohol-related in the majority of 
incidents. Small wonder, too, that 65% of violations of California's alcoholic 
beverage control laws involve illegal sales to minors.

FOR SOME, 'PARENTHOOD' IS NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some comments on Nina J. Easton's July 30 article about the Ron Howard's film 
"Parenthood," which, according to the headline, "reflects the movies' latest 
discovery: kids and families." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Grazer, Howard's partner in Imagine Films, is quoted as saying: "Now 
being hip is being a responsible dad. . . . It's hip to have substance." 
</P>
<P>
Hip? He makes child rearing sound like the latest dance step. 
</P>
<P>
'Hip to have substance" now? Does that mean that a short time ago it was "hip 
to be superficial"? 
</P>
<P>
I hope that reading Grazer's remarks doesn't provoke a bunch of folks to rush 
out and become parents so they too can share in the "hip" experience. Just as 
bell-bottom pants and alligator-emblem shirts went speedily out, so might this 
latest craze. 
</P>
<P>
And when a child no longer serves a desire for hipness, what do you say to 
little Mary or Johnny? "Sorry, kid, but you're out of style"?

The argument that corporate sponsorship helps to keep concert-ticket costs down 
is specious. 
</P>
<P>
Without corporate sponsorship, ticket prices could stay the same or even go 
down -- if the venues, promoters, musicians, et al., accepted smaller profits. 
</P>
<P>
I do not say they should be obligated to do so. They can charge whatever they 
like. It is up to the consumer to decide if the goods are worth the price; just 
as it is up to the consumer (a.k.a. the people) to decide if the politics of a 
musical act, or a corporation, are worthy of support.

At least 70,000 people waving nationalist flags and banners packed the central 
square in Baku, the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, to demand greater autonomy 
and new parliamentary elections. The demonstration was organized by the 
republic's fledgling Popular Front movement, which aims to promote economic and 
political autonomy from Moscow. Many participants waved red, green and white 
flags with a crescent and star, the national banner during Azerbaijan's time as 
an independent republic from 1918 to 1920. Activists said their main demands 
are for an end to Moscow's direct administration of the Azerbaijani territory 
of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is also claimed by Armenia; more powers for the 
Azerbaijani Parliament, and new elections to the national Parliament.

ANTI-DRUG CRUSADER EULOGIZED AT MASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slain anti-drug crusader Maria Hernandez was eulogized at a Mass attended by 
300 mourners in New York, including Mayor Edward I. Koch. There was heavy 
security to prevent further violence against her family. Hernandez, 34, a 
mother of three who with her husband had fought to force drug dealers out of 
her Brooklyn neighborhood, was shot to death last week, possibly in retaliation 
for her anti-drug efforts. During a 70-minute Mass in Spanish and English at 
St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, the Rev. Charles Plock praised the 
woman's efforts to transform her neighborhood into a place where there would be 
"no mourning, no tears, no fear. She labored and she struggled and she fought. 
She organized people to make her community reflect this new heaven and this new 
Earth," Plock said. "Maria gave her life because she was not afraid to speak 
the truth."

A singer and two crew members with LL Cool J's rap band were charged with 
raping a 15-year-old girl who attended an after-concert party in Minneapolis 
after going backstage on a pass won in a radio contest. The girl told 
authorities that six to eight men taunted her during the assault and made 
comments such as "when's it going to be our turn?" Singer David James Parker, 
26, and band technician Gary Chris Saunders, 22, both of New York, and 
bodyguard Christopher Elias Tsipouras, 26, of Union, N.J., were charged Friday 
with first-degree criminal sexual conduct. LL Cool J, whose real name is James 
Todd Smith, was not involved in the incident after Wednesday night's concert, 
police said. LL Cool J, short for Ladies Love Cool James, is among the best 
known rappers.

In the third major Free World rocket launch in five days, the 126-foot, 
$30-million Delta 2, equipped with nine strap-on solid-fuel boosters, was 
scheduled for takeoff from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida 
early today. Atop the slender blue-and-white rocket inside a protective nose 
cone was the third of 21 new $65-million Global Positioning System navigation 
satellites designed to tell military units their locations to within 53 feet 
anywhere in the world. Heavy thunderstorms rolled through the cape and an Air 
Force spokeswoman said there was a 20% chance of the weather delaying the 
launch.

MOURNERS OF GIRL HEAR CALL FOR FIGHT ON GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A funeral service Saturday for a 7-year-old Watts girl who was killed in a 
drive-by shooting turned into a forum of emotional pleas for an end to gang 
violence and the capture of the child's killer. 
</P>
<P>
In the services, held at the 114th Street Church of God in Christ in Watts, 
Patricia Patrick, executive director of Mothers Against Gangs in the Community, 
urged mourners for Kanita Hailey to "let this child be the last child" they 
bury. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) pledged a reward of $5,000 of her 
own money for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the child's 
death. As Waters left the funeral, just a few blocks from the Hailey home, the 
assemblywoman said she had already received "new information." 
</P>
<P>
"People came forward and told me things just since we left the church," Waters 
said outside a recreation center in the Imperial Courts housing project, where 
Kanita was shot while playing baseball with friends Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Waters urged residents of Watts to stop tolerating "AK-47s and Uzis in our 
community and in our homes." She said residents should report people who keep 
such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Of the reward she offered, Waters said: "I wish we had more -- $100,000 or 
$500,000. Anyone who might have a license plate number or any other 
information, tell them I have $5,000 for them." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the funeral service, members of an organization 
called the American Assn. of Women blamed police and city officials for failing 
to protect the people of Watts from gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Protection 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame police cannot protect us the way they protect the people in 
Bel-Air, Brentwood and Pacific Palisades," said Gwen Johnson, president of the 
Imperial Courts chapter of the association. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the press conference urged Imperial Court residents not to "point 
blame" at police, particularly while Kanita's family is still grieving. 
</P>
<P>
Myrtle Hailey, mother of the slain child, appeared at the press conference but 
did not speak. Family members said she and her remaining three children were 
returning by bus Saturday night to their hometown of Evansville, Ind. The 
mother had planned to return to Indiana before the shooting, family members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people attended the Hailey service, including many of the children who 
witnessesed the tragic shooting. A French television crew filming a documentary 
on gang violence also was present. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Look at Ourselves' 
</P>
<P>
The pastor of the church, Elder J.W. Mayfield, said in his eulogy: "Something 
is vitally wrong in our families. We can't blame it all on the police. We 
better look at ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Kanita was shot as she played baseball in a fenced yard in Imperial Courts. 
Witnesses said gunmen in a car that raced by appeared to be shooting at a group 
of young men standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
As the men and the other children dove for cover, Kanita panicked and ran 
toward her home. She was struck once in the temple and died two days later at 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Imperial Courts told reporters last week that a police car that 
arrived quickly at the crime scene did not chase the getaway car. When a crowd 
complained to police about the delay, they were beaten with batons, residents 
said. One man contends that his arm was broken by a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. M.M. Wasson, commander of the Southeast Division, said Friday that police 
had determined that the man with the broken arm was treated at a hospital the 
night of the shooting. Earlier in the week, Wasson said that his preliminary 
inquiry did not show any wrongdoing by the officers on the scene.

FOUR DIE IN FIERY AUTO CRASH; SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD and DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people, including a 5-year-old girl, were killed and two others were 
injured Saturday when a speeding car driven by a suspected drunk driver slammed 
into four other vehicles at a stoplight, causing one car to burst into flames, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the speeding car, Phillip Carlos Jarmon, 28, of Covina, 
apparently failed to notice four cars stopped in front of him at the busy 
intersection of 190th Street and Normandie Avenue in the Harbor Gateway area, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jarmon's car, traveling eastbound on 190th Street shortly after 5 p.m., 
sideswiped three vehicles stopped in a left lane, veered and struck a Toyota 
station wagon in the right lane, said Sgt. Dave Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact propelled (the station wagon) into the intersection," said 
Reynolds. "It overturned and caught on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Three people inside were "burned beyond recognition," Reynolds said. 
Investigators were trying to determine the identities of the victims, who were 
so badly burned that police could not tell whether they were men, women or 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, police said, two other passengers in the wagon -- both children -- 
were either thrown out, pulled out or somehow escaped. One, a 5-year-old girl, 
was pronounced dead a short time later at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance. 
The other, a boy of about 10, was listed in serious condition late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jarmon was treated at the hospital for cuts on his face and right arm. He was 
arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and vehicular 
manslaughter, Reynolds said. Police were unsure how fast his car was going. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably one of the worst things I've ever seen," said one observer, who 
described the burned car as "a pile of rubble. It was pretty awful out there." 
</P>
<P>
The wide, heavily traveled intersection -- almost in the shadow of a billboard 
advertising beer -- was almost completely blocked for several hours. Jarmon's 
1975 Chevrolet Malibu ended up on the far side of the intersection, facing 
northbound, while the wagon spun into a crosswalk, its tires melted from the 
heat of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses at the accident scene, dozens of police officers and 
firefighters worked in the fading evening light to clear away debris and free 
the charred bodies trapped inside the station wagon. The car with the bodies 
still inside remained at the scene, surrounded by shattered glass and flares, 
for more than two hours while officers and a coroner's deputy gathered 
evidence.

LAWYER AIMS TO MAKE TRIAL A FORUM ON GOD, ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cyrus Zal, a defense attorney in the trial of five anti-abortion protesters, 
proudly recalls a time earlier this year when a judge, so exasperated by Zal's 
courtroom antics, stormed off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, Zal remembers, called him one of the most obnoxious and offensive 
attorneys he had ever faced. Eventually, the judge was forced to declare a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
Zal is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
This time the scene is a sixth-floor room in the Los Angeles County Courthouse, 
where religious convictions and the law clash head on, and where theatrics keep 
bailiffs hopping. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, general counsel for the Operation Rescue anti-abortion group, has fought 
with the judge and with the prosecution over how prominently he can display his 
ever-present Bible, how loudly he can mumble his trial-time prayers, how 
extensively he can question jurors about their respect for God's law over Man's 
law. 
</P>
<P>
He has challenged the judge to throw him in jail, to hold him in contempt, to 
make him sit down. On that last score, two marshals made Zal comply. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a mock trial, and in a mock trial you are going to get convicted 
unless you do something drastic," Zal said later in explaining his tactics. "I 
trust in the Lord, whatever he wants me to do. I feel the Holy Spirit guiding 
me in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say Zal is acting in a deliberately antagonistic manner to provoke 
Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez into making errors, to gain jurors' sympathies 
and to portray the defendants as disadvantaged victims of a biased judiciary. 
The tactics will backfire, say the critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are trying to set themselves up as martyrs being oppressed by the 
system, but I don't think most people . . . go for it," said ACLU attorney 
Carol Sobel, who is up against Zal in another civil contempt trial against 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe he thinks drama carries the day. . . . But I think those kind of 
antics just don't go over well." 
</P>
<P>
Zal, of Folsom, is one of a handful of defense attorneys involved in the trial 
of Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and four others. They are charged 
with misdemeanor trespass, conspiracy and related counts, stemming from an 
illegal blockade at a Los Angeles women's clinic March 25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jury Selection Continues 
</P>
<P>
After four days of often-tense questioning, a 12-member jury was selected 
Friday afternoon; four alternates must be chosen before opening arguments can 
be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, Terry and the others have made it clear that they wish to use the trial as 
a platform for debating and condemning abortion. Paez has been firm: "Abortion 
is not on trial here," he has admonished the defendants and the jurors, 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of abortion enters time and again. 
</P>
<P>
The defense team has asked prospective jurors their opinions on abortion, 
whether they know what abortion is, whether they belong to any pro-choice 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
A woman from China was asked if any of her relatives had to submit to "forced 
abortions" in that country. A man was asked if he had been present at the 
births of his children. Those are the questions that are allowed; other, more 
graphic questions are not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Objections 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Lara Bloomquist has listened intently throughout the 
defense's interrogation, registering regular objections to what she sees as 
inappropriate comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the defense has made it pretty clear they intend to have clashes with 
the judge and they have done it consistently," Bloomquist said. "They openly 
defy the judge." 
</P>
<P>
It is during Zal's interrogation that most of the sparks fly. On Monday, Zal 
was ending his arguments before Paez with a "God bless you"; by mid-week his 
tone and demeanor had changed, and he was accusing Paez of attempting to 
"stifle" the defense. Paez says he is merely trying to keep the defense from 
intimidating jurors and introducing irrelevant issues. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, when a prospective juror responded that he believed abortion to be 
justified in certain circumstances, Zal posed a question: When, he asked, is it 
OK for the woman to "go to an abortionist and have him decapitate that baby?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Issued 
</P>
<P>
With that comment, which Paez later called inflammatory, the judge ordered the 
courtroom cleared of all prospective jurors. He sternly put Zal on notice: "Ask 
another question like that," Paez said, "and your voir dire (interrogation) is 
terminated." 
</P>
<P>
Zal insisted he would continue to ask such questions; Paez ruled Zal's 
questioning of jurors was over. Terry and co-defendant Jeff White leaped to 
their feet demanding mistrials based on "judicial prejudice." Zal refused to 
sit down. Paez ordered Zal to sit. He continued to refuse. Paez ordered two 
bailiffs to place Zal in a chair; one grabbed his arm and they pushed him into 
the chair. 
</P>
<P>
White stuffed a crumpled piece of legal note pad paper into his mouth as the 
prospective jurors filed back in. 
</P>
<P>
Paez and Zal make interesting foils. Both are slim, 41-year-old men of similar 
appearances, with black mustaches. Both attended UC Berkeley -- Zal did his 
undergraduate work there, Paez graduated from its law school. The similarities 
appear to end there. 
</P>
<P>
Zal was born in Tehran, moved with his family to the United States when he was 
3 and "found the Lord Jesus" four years ago after years as a "heathen." The 
bulk of his legal cases is work for Operation Rescue. He is an active member of 
an Anglican congregation, the Church of the Holy Trinity in Sacramento, where 
his brother-in-law is the minister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graduate of BYU 
</P>
<P>
Paez is a Mormon, born and raised in Utah and a graduate of Brigham Young 
University. He also worked for several years for the California Legal 
Assistance, the Western Center on Law and Poverty and the Los Angeles Legal Aid 
Foundation. He was appointed to the Municipal bench in 1981 and was elected 
presiding judge last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite several heated exchanges, Paez, for the most part, has kept his cool. 
He does at times seem exasperated by the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
When defendant Michael McMonagle asked that the time for the daily lunch break 
be shortened so that the defendants would have more time to argue their case, 
Paez refused. "It's obvious to me that I'm going to need the lunch break," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants are Andrew Eppink and Donald Bennette. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the limelight with Zal is the 30-year-old Terry. From the first day of 
the pretrial proceedings, when several dozen placard-waving demonstrators 
gathered outside the court, then crowded inside the courtroom and held hands in 
prayer, Terry has been in his element. 
</P>
<P>
He greets court clerks by their first names, shakes hands with followers, 
pauses long enough to do a live interview for radio on a portable phone carried 
by an aide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eager to Tell Story 
</P>
<P>
Calling the opening day of the trial one of the most exciting days in his life, 
Terry said he eagerly awaited telling his story to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But the audience he is playing to clearly extends far beyond the County 
Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think that sound bite will entertain a few people tonight?" he asks a 
reporter during a pause in the proceedings, after he had uttered one of his 
so-quotable quotes. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he pleads with another reporter not to use a negative off-the-cuff 
comment about President Bush. Though a horde of television and print reporters 
crowded to cover the first two days of pretrial hearings, by week's end the 
coverage had dwindled to occasional visits by local print reporters. Also in 
steady attendance: a columnist for People Magazine.

BRADLEY RECORDS: HIS PRIVATE RITUAL NOW A PUBLIC ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mayor Tom Bradley sat down each year to fill out public disclosure forms 
on his personal financial dealings, aides and close associates say, it was an 
intensely private ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern began with the earliest and simplest of Bradley's disclosure 
statements, aides say, 14 years ago when Watergate-era voters first required 
California's elected officials to reveal holdings and income sources to avoid 
possible conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
At first the mayor, who had only a few investments, filled the forms out by 
hand, aides say. But even in later years -- as both the information required 
and Bradley's investment portfolio grew more complex -- the mayor prepared the 
forms by himself, then sometimes hovered over a personal secretary as she typed 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shunned Assistance 
</P>
<P>
He worked from memory and from whatever records were available, and he neither 
sought nor obtained help, say his aides and his accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"I never offered because I know he's very private about such things," said 
Anton Calleia, the mayor's longtime chief administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it himself and he wasn't very good at it," said Jules Glazer, the 
mayor's accountant. 
</P>
<P>
That is the explanation the mayor and his supporters are offering for what they 
describe as inadvertent and "highly technical" mistakes in the mayor's public 
accounting of his personal investments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public's Right Cited 
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of errors and the nature of some of the omissions, as 
revealed in a massive series of amendments filed by Bradley on Friday, may add 
to the public's suspicions about the embattled mayor, said Walter Zelman, 
executive director of California Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the extensive errors as "openly negligent," Zelman said: "The public 
has a right to question whether this (results from) the general inability of 
the individual to do the job himself, or some larger effort of concealment, or 
some kind of disrespect for the law." 
</P>
<P>
After months of controversy, and amid a series of city, state and federal 
investigations of Bradley's business dealings, the mayor filed 66 pages of 
amendments to his financial disclosure statements spanning 1984 through 1988. 
The filing with the state Fair Political Practices Commission -- two weeks past 
deadline -- corrected more than 100 errors, ranging from substantial omissions 
to minor technical errors. 
</P>
<P>
The tangled nature of the mayor's earlier reports had helped fuel suspicions 
that the mayor might have mixed personal and public business. Bradley's lawyers 
had to spend months reconstructing an accurate and complete picture of the 
mayor's investment activities. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such problems in the future, Bradley in April announced that he would 
place all of his investments in a blind trust. On Saturday, Deputy Mayor 
Michael Gage said creation of the trust is "imminent." UCLA professor of 
management William Ouchi and William Doheny, managing director of the U.S. 
Trust Co. of California, had been been selected to administer the trust. And 
the prominent downtown law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher will be legal 
counsel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Direct Control 
</P>
<P>
Gage said Bradley will have no direct control over his investments and will 
only receive periodic reports on his worth and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The corrections filed Friday showed that Bradley apparently obtained several 
securities -- such as BCI Holding, Inc., junk bonds handled by Drexel Burnham 
Lambert -- when they were readily available to the general public. Bradley's 
relationship with Drexel and its indicted former junk bond king, Michael 
Milken, is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But they also revealed previously undisclosed investments in two California 
land partnerships, Sierra Investors, Ltd., and Yosemite Investors, Ltd.; a 
television shopping channel, CVN Inc.; a New York-based mortgage firm, American 
Insured Mortgage Investors; Cadence Design Systems Inc., a San Jose-based 
computer software supplier; as well as junk bonds and warrants Bradley held in 
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has reported that Bradley lawyers have been exploring the mayor's 
dealings with Columbia vice chairman Abe Spiegel, a longtime friend and 
fund-raiser.

In addition, the amended statements show the mayor failed to accurately report 
a series of transactions, ranging from the amounts and dates of stock trades to 
the circumstances surrounding loans. In a few cases he listed properties and 
securities he no longer owned. 
</P>
<P>
The reports showed Bradley obtained shares of two hard-to-get, hot new issues 
of stock -- L.A. Gear athletic wear and Worlds of Wonder toy company -- and and 
turned a quick profit of about $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new questions raised by the reports are the previously undisclosed or 
misreported transactions involving Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. Bradley, on his 
original forms, had reported receiving a personal loan from Columbia. On his 
amended forms, he reported the loan actually went to a Riverside land 
partnership, KSTJ II. 
</P>
<P>
One of his partners, Juanita St. John, said Saturday that the loan was for 
$50,000 and was used to pay a balloon payment on a previous mortgage. She said 
she was not certain who arranged the loan or what the interest rate was, but 
she maintained that the partnership did not get special treatment because of 
Bradley's ties to Columbia executive Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
St. John heads the mayor's city-funded Task Force for Africa Relations, which 
the city attorney and controller are investigating for possible misuse of tax 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also reported Friday for the first time more details about foreign 
governments and others who helped pay some of his travel expenses. He said a 
$3,000 tab for his 1987 trade trip to Africa was paid by the Asian American 
Economic Development Enterprises and Small Business Development Group. The city 
attorney is investigating the exact source of the funds, which originated with 
a charitable donation from Matsushita Electric Co. of America, the parent 
company of Panasonic Co. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the firm said Matsushita did not intend the funds to be used 
for Bradley's trip.

VALENZUELA OF OLD LEAVES GIANTS TWISTING IN WIND, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't so much a game as three hours of sweet memories. 
</P>
<P>
There was Fernando Valenzuela, throwing the ball around hitters. There he was, 
throwing the ball past hitters. There he was, ultimately making hitters twist 
in the Candlestick Park wind like hot dog wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after his two-hitter helped the Dodgers score a 5-1 victory over the 
Giants Saturday, there he was, being funny. 
</P>
<P>
Of his fastball, timed at 85 m.p.h.: "I think the wind helped it." 
</P>
<P>
Of worry over his comeback from shoulder problems: "Sure, I worry. Why do you 
think I've been swinging a bat so much? I can't pitch, I got to do something." 
</P>
<P>
About next year, when he could be lost to the Dodgers through free agency: "You 
mean, am I going to retire? I don't think I should retire, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
Many who watched Saturday's game, including most of the 49,772 fans and some 
stunned Giants, wouldn't mind if he quit. He gave up only a fifth-inning single 
by Kirt Manwaring and a sixth-inning double by Matt Williams, both grounders 
down the third-base line, barely out of reach of third baseman Jeff Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
The victory equaled the low-hit game of his nine-year career and, although he 
has thrown eight two-hitters, it was his first since Sept. 22, 1986. If 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin had not made a third-inning error that led to the 
Giants' unearned run, it would have been his first shutout since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't throw like he did in the past," said the Giants' Brett Butler, who 
faced Valenzuela in his early 1980s glory days. "But today, he had a little bit 
of that magic." 
</P>
<P>
Butler's teammates, whose lead in the National League West was cut to three 
games over Houston, preferred different words. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark, who had a 14-game hitting streak working, went hitless in four 
at-bats and drove only one ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who had four homers in his last 10 at-bats, managed only the double 
and struck out twice. 
</P>
<P>
Said a frustrated Clark: "That's as good as I've seen him in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig was more specific. "That's the best I've seen him 
throw in two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was even a terror at the plate with two hits, including an RBI 
double that gave the Dodgers their second run. 
</P>
<P>
"After watching him today, there is no reason at all to believe he cannot get 
back to where he was," Dodger infielder Dave Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who at one point this season had not won a game in 11 months, 
merely smiled. It isn't like this performance should have sneaked up on 
anybody. Although he is 7-11, he has a 3.46 earned-run average and has given up 
more than three earned runs in only four of 23 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Since he defeated Atlanta June 6 for his first victory in 19 starts since June 
14, 1988, he has gone 7-6 with a 3.34 ERA. He got only eight runs to work with 
in four consecutive starts in that a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get frustrated, I quit," Valenzuela said. "I understand how the game can 
be. I know what little things can do to you. I have learned how to take them." 
</P>
<P>
It was no small thing July 31, 1988 when he was placed on the disabled list for 
the first time in his career with a sore left shoulder. He made only two 
appearances after that, then began this season winless in his first 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The cries to remove him from the rotation were ignored by Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been so great for us through all the year, he deserved the opportunity 
to get himself right," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to give him that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Said Valenzuela: "I only worried about it when I first hurt the shoulder. I 
wondered what was ahead for me. But then I realized, there was nothing I could 
do about it. I have a good career. If I'm finished, I'm finished." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his record, with every start this year he has proved he is not 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
"We always saw improvement," pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else may have noticed it, but we saw more velocity, better control, a 
lot of little things." 
</P>
<P>
They finally saw it all Saturday. Only seven Giants hit the ball out of the 
infield on the fly. He had six strikeouts. The new Valenzuela impressed nearly 
everyone, even those who didn't know the old Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen this year, today said a lot more about Fernando than just 
pitching," Dodger rookie pitcher John Wetteland said. 
</P>
<P>
"All he has been through, this says more about himself. To do what he did, 
against these caliber of hitters. . . . I only wish I was around to see what he 
used to be like." 
</P>
<P>
"He was masterful," second baseman Willie Randolph said. "He was throwing the 
ball in, then throwing it away, putting it right where he wanted. They were 
swinging at a lot of screwballs that weren't even strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela: "I think I threw more strikes today than usual. That was the thing. 
I got ahead of the hitters, then they had to swing at my pitch." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes Saturday, that pitch was even a fastball, which Valenzuela used 
to throw at more than 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"He had more velocity than I've seen in a long time," catcher Rick Dempsey 
said, noting the 85 m.p.h. clocking on one fastball. "I'd say he's gone up 5 
m.p.h. just during the season." 
</P>
<P>
"The more I pitch," Valenzuela said, "the more my arm feels much better. I 
can't tell you if my arm is stronger. I only know it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
He said it also felt good to watch his teammates score, which they did on 14 
hits against three pitchers. Against starter and loser Bob Knepper, Jose 
Gonzalez hit his second homer of the season. Valenzuela had his RBI double, and 
Hamilton had an RBI single. The scoring was completed in the seventh inning 
when Eddie Murray hit a two-run homer, his 13th, off Jeff Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Giants scored their only run on a rare error by shortstop Alfredo Griffin 
in a third inning that featured no hits. One out after Fernando Valenzuela had 
hit Kirt Manwaring on the foot to lead off the inning, pitcher Bob Knepper 
attempted a sacrifice bunt. Valenzuela grabbed it and threw to second for what 
would have been a sure out. But the ball glanced off Griffin's glove and 
bounced into left field. Manwaring wound up on third base, then scored on Brett 
Butler's grounder. It was only Griffin's 12th error of the year, but Valenzuela 
is used to those. Opponents have scored a team-leading 11 unearned runs against 
him. . . . Valenzuela dodged the question of free agency Saturday, saying, "We 
have two more months left. I worry only about my next game. This winter is in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
Although they are not pennant contenders, the Dodgers have a magic number -- 
four. Thirteen of the last 15 times they have scored four or more runs, they 
have won. Overall they are 38-9 in games in which they have scored at least 
four runs. . . . Willie Randolph was back in the lineup after being sidelined 
for two days because of sore upper legs. He went two for five, but with 
upcoming games on the turf of Philadelphia and Montreal, he has other worries. 
"My hamstrings are fine, but turf doesn't hurt those," said Randolph, who has 
missed only 10 games, fewer than all but Jeff Hamilton (10 missed games) and 
Eddie Murray (no missed games). "Turf hurts the knees and feet. I'll just have 
to stretch a lot and pray." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger rookie outfielder Mike Huff, who beat out an infield single and scored a 
run in his second major league start, said he was used to the Candlestick Park 
wind and cold. At Northwestern University north of Chicago, he said he once 
played a doubleheader in 25-degree temperatures with a 20-m.p.h. wind. He has 
also played in a snowstorm so bad he couldn't see the batter from the outfield. 
"I've played where you tape your sleeves to your arms so you won't freeze," 
Huff said. "I've played where everyone wears stocking caps and boots in the 
dugout." Huff was nonetheless fooled by a fly ball here Friday night, finally 
making the catch after falling, crawling, then diving. . . . Knepper, 
Saturday's loser, has lost to the Dodgers more times -- 20 -- than to any other 
National League opponent.

MIKE DOWNEY: HEY! HEADS UP, YOU ANGELS! DON'T LOSE A SEASON IN THE SUN 
</P>

<P>
In the first place, the Angels no longer are in first place. No matter what 
happens at Anaheim Stadium today, the Oakland Athletics are going to leave town 
ahead of the Angels in the standings. And they just might stay there. 
</P>
<P>
The A's are like baseballs hit to Chili Davis -- you aren't sure if they're 
going to be caught. These guys have a score to settle, a losing score. They 
went to the World Series a year ago, only to run into Orel and Mickey and Kirk 
and those other characters. They want to go back, give a better account of 
themselves, and among the people standing in their way are the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the famous batman, Jose Canseco, the Athletics have done some 
serious Angel-bashing over the past two days in Anaheim, a couple of five-run 
runaways including Saturday's 8-3 decision. 
</P>
<P>
Another similar outcome today and the Angels will find themselves three lengths 
back, with no games left against the A's thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sort of nice if these were the last three games of the season," was the 
wishful thinking of Oakland slugger Mark McGwire, who homered and also walked 
with the bases loaded Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics clearly are the boys to beat now, the reigning American League 
champions who are rounding into 1988 form, just at the right time. The Angels 
are going to have to play heads-up ball just to stay close, and Saturday they 
definitely played heads-down. 
</P>
<P>
How many games will a team need to win the American League West? Hard telling. 
Depends on how soon the Angels pull out of this little fishtail of theirs. The 
A's wouldn't mind beating them again today, because every game counts, and 
because baseball people are trained to believe that no lead is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"High in the 90s," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said, speculating on the 
number of victories it will take to take the division. "Maybe in the 100s. 
That's why it's important to stay hungry. We've got a day off Monday, so let's 
let it all hang out." 
</P>
<P>
The A's want to get going now, while the going is good. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels? Things are not, at the moment, all that good. 
</P>
<P>
Bad hitting, bad hustle, bad hops. Somebody had better remind the Angels that 
while some ballclubs need all they help they can get, the Athletics do not. 
Against the A's, it is wise to swing at every fat pitch, run out every pop fly, 
hurl yourself in front of every grounder. Play as though these are the 
playoffs. The A's are too good to beat when you are going bad. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two people already have 
popped into the Big A over a two-day span to catch the Angels-A's act. What 
they have seen is the home team at its worst. What they are hoping is that 
things will take a turn for the better, before the A's can run away and hide. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels hardly needed to lose shortstop Dick Schofield and designated hitter 
Brian Downing with injuries at this late date. Bad timing and bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The hits have stopped dropping. The Angels have had runners cross home plate in 
only two of their last 24 innings. They have hit one home run in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't help the offense any when Tony Armas check-swings twice with the 
bases loaded, on strike two and strike three, or when Jack Howell jogs from 
home plate on an infield fly that the Oakland second baseman deliberately 
drops, turning it into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Howell started running full out, the A's had turned the relay. It 
was a close call at first base, and Howell might even have beaten the throw, 
but umpire Joe Brinkman called him out -- an embarrassing 4-6-3 if ever there 
were one. 
</P>
<P>
"He was safe," television analyst Tom Seaver said after watching the replay, 
"but I think Joe Brinkman punched out Jack Howell on general principles, for 
lack of hustle." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels can play better than this. They have played better than this, all 
season long. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the time to wait and see what happens. This is the time to throw 
yourself on the grenade. 
</P>
<P>
Take that killer play Saturday, when a ground ball by Oakland's Terry Steinbach 
took a hop on Angel shortstop Kent Anderson like no hop you have ever seen, 
right over his shoulder and into the outfield, a two-run single. That ball 
couldn't have just hit a pebble to hop like that. Must have hit a sprinkler 
head or a gopher's head or something. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Anderson probably feels awful about not at least getting a glove on 
that ball. Because on such plays, pennant races can turn. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels concede nothing. They know they are still very much in this thing. 
</P>
<P>
They just have to keep hustling, before they get punched out on general 
principles.

ANGELS CAN'T BOUNCE BACK AGAINST ATHLETICS; 
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND TAKES 2-GAME LEAD WITH 8-3 WIN BEFORE 53,036 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Kent Anderson, the Angels' rookie shortstop, blamed it on "the clods." 
</P>
<P>
No, he wasn't referring to the nine Angels on the field Saturday, although they 
certainly contributed to the Oakland Athletics' 8-3 victory before a crowd of 
53,036 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
No, Anderson was talking about those clumps of dirt on the left side of the 
infield, one of which helped trigger the Angels' second loss in as many days to 
the new leaders of the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
The game was still scoreless when a third-inning grounder by the Athletics' 
Terry Steinbach struck a rough patch in the dirt in front of Anderson, 
catapulting the baseball from Anderson's ankles to his nose in a blink of an 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
It was a hellacious hop, leaving Anderson without a prayer of making the play. 
Over his head the ball sailed, bounding into left field while Carney Lansford 
scored from third base and Dave Henderson followed from second. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were suddenly down, 2-0, and the afternoon's tone had been instantly 
established. 
</P>
<P>
In the six-month scorebook of the 1989 season, put this game down as a bad-hop 
single. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the struggle today," said Oakland Manager Tony La Russa, stopping just 
short of apologizing for a victory that gave his team a two-game lead over the 
Angels. "That was a struggle out there -- for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
For 3 1/2 hours, the Angels and A's labored, sometimes against the heat, 
sometimes against the grass and soil, often against themselves. 
</P>
<P>
So weary was the going that Jim Abbott, the Angels' starting pitcher, lasted 
only three-plus innings before getting pulled from a 2-2 game by Manager Doug 
Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because, Rader said, it was the only humane thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're pitching under that kind of duress for three innings, it drains 
you emotionally and physically," Rader said. "The effort involved in those 
first three innings took so much out of him, it served no purpose to keep him 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Call it an exercise in stress management. 
</P>
<P>
Angel nerves began to wrack in the second inning when left fielder Chili Davis 
misjudged a shallow fly ball hit by Dave Parker. Davis initially retreated on 
the ball before racing in to make up for lost time. The ball dropped in front 
of his glove and skipped past him for a double. 
</P>
<P>
Momentarily shaken, Abbott walked the next two batters to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
It took a few calming words from Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, a 
comeback grounder by Mike Gallego and a strikeout by Rickey Henderson to rescue 
Abbott without an Oakland run crossing the plate. 
</P>
<P>
But Abbott had hardly caught his breath before conditions crumbled again in the 
third. Lansford pinged a leadoff grounder off the glove of diving Jack Howell, 
the Angels' third baseman, for an infield single. Dave Henderson blooped a 
double over first baseman Wally Joyner's head. And both runners scored when 
Steinbach's one-out bouncer to shortstop exploded on Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Howell misplayed a grounder by Tony Phillips for an error and 
Ron Hassey singled off the glove of second baseman Johnny Ray and the bases 
were loaded once more. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Abbott quelled the threat by retiring the eighth hitter of the inning, 
Gallego, on a force play. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the kid catch a break in three innings?" Rader said. "(The A's) put six 
hits on the board, and I couldn't remember any of them." 
</P>
<P>
When Abbott opened the fourth inning by walking Rickey Henderson and Lansford, 
Rader finally interceded and brought on reliever Dan Petry. Again, Abbott 
couldn't catch a break. Petry walked the first two men he faced to force in one 
run, and yielded a sacrifice fly to Parker to score another. 
</P>
<P>
The A's led, 4-2 . . . with all four runs charged to Abbott (10-8). 
</P>
<P>
The Angels would score another run in the fifth inning on a walk by Claudell 
Washington and a double by Johnny Ray, but would also strand seven runners 
against Oakland pitchers Bob Welch (12-7) and Todd Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Worse still, they were flimflammed out of the fourth inning by A's second 
baseman Phillips, who turned an infield pop fly by Howell into a inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
With Davis on first base with one out, Welch jammed Howell on an inside pitch, 
resulting in a rapidly dying pop-up to the right side of the infield. Both 
Davis and Howell figured the ball would be caught, but Phillips let it drop and 
then flipped to second to set an apparent double play in motion. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, was not readily apparent to Davis or Howell. Davis remained 
standing on first base and Howell stopped running. Once the ball hit the 
ground, Howell resumed his sprint -- but not quickly enough to beat shortstop 
Gallego's throw to first. 
</P>
<P>
Rader was less than pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an outstanding play on Phillips' part and a very negligent play on Jack 
Howell's part," he said. "We will address it." 
</P>
<P>
The play loomed significantly until the eighth inning, when Angel reliever Greg 
Minton replaced Petry and turned a 4-3 Oakland advantage into an 8-3 runaway. 
Minton pitched to four batters, and the first three resulted in runs. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford had a run-scoring ground out. Dave Henderson had a run-scoring single. 
And Mark McGwire drove in the two final runs with a home run, his 21st of the 
season and the third Minton has allowed in his last two innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
This from the same pitcher who, before this week, had allowed just two home 
runs during the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Greg's in one of those things that everybody who's ever played 
the game has gone through," Rader said. "We'll weather the storm." 
</P>
<P>
That, for the moment, reigns as the Angel battle cry. The clouds, however, have 
yet to break. If the Angels are to avoid a three-game sweep today, they will 
have to find a way to weather Oakland's Dave Stewart, the winningest pitcher in 
the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game was as pitted and pock-marked as the Anaheim Stadium infield, 
which, according to several Angel infielders, was pretty bad. "It's all chewed 
up and clodded up," said shortstop Kent Anderson, nearly beaned by a bad-hop 
single by Terry Steinbach. "The ball hit one of those clods and kicked up so 
bad, I couldn't even get in front of it to see it." Added third baseman Jack 
Howell: "We've known all year that this is a tough infield to play on. The 
infield is hard, and there's a different kind of grass. Day games make it 
especially tough. They water the infield and 20 minutes later, it's bone-dry 
again. And today, with no wind or cool breeze and a hot sun, it was probably a 
little harder than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Howell was asked about the pop fly-turned double play he hit at Oakland second 
baseman Tony Phillips in the fourth inning. "I got jammed and had no idea where 
the ball went," Howell said. "It could have been foul, for all I knew. I 
started to run, but when I saw Phillips under it I gave up. I had a feeling he 
might do that (let the ball drop) and that's when I took off. But by then, it 
was too late." Chili Davis never left first base on the play and afterward, had 
to ask umpire Tim McClelland if Phillips' little deke was indeed legal. "I 
asked McClelland, 'Tim, can he do that?' " Davis said. "And he said, 'Yeah, the 
only time you can call the infield fly rule is when there are runners on first 
and second. And (Phillips) let the ball hit the ground before hitting his 
glove, which is also allowed. But I couldn't do anything. I had to hope Jack 
would beat it out." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott admitted he was exhausted when Angel Manager Doug Rader decided to 
replace him with two runners on base and no outs in the fourth inning. "I'm not 
going to apologize for being tired in the fourth inning," Abbott said. "I'd 
battled as hard as I could, and I just couldn't get the ball over the plate 
anymore." Abbott said he was "not crying" over the bevy of bad hops and 
misplayed balls that vexed him Saturday, but he conceded such things make 
pitching tougher. "Sure," he said. "It's as tough to take as a double off the 
wall. It all contributes. But I'm sure it's just as tough on infielders when 
they see their pitcher walk people."

REID STAYS IN EYE OF THE STORM; 
</P>
<P>
OPENS 3-SHOT LEAD BEFORE HEAVY RAIN HALTS PLAY IN PGA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The atmosphere at the PGA Championship Saturday was positively electric. And 
that was the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated flashes of lightning, claps of thunder and torrents of rain forced 
tournament officials to postpone the remainder of the third round with the 
final group, including leader Mike Reid, having completed only nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
Players will resume their third rounds at Kemper Lakes Golf Club early this 
morning where they were before they left the course. Barring more bad weather, 
the players will finish this 72-hole tournament by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
Reid birdied the first, fifth and seventh holes before bunkering his four-wood 
second shot at the ninth to finish with a bogey and a 34. His 45-hole total of 
13 under par leads Craig Stadler by three strokes, Chris Perry by four and 
Leonard Thompson, Isao Aoki, Ian Woosnam and Dave Rummells by five. 
</P>
<P>
Aoki was one of 31 golfers to finish 18 holes before the storm. He made eight 
birdies and one bogey and needed only 22 putts for his 65. Perhaps the most 
impressive aspect of his round was the consecutive sand saves he managed on the 
eighth, ninth and 10th holes. 
</P>
<P>
But the real story was the lightning. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few players, including U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange, thought 
officials should have suspended play sooner than they did. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, seven shots behind Reid, waited on the 10th tee for more than 10 
minutes, trying to persuade Pat Rielly, president of the PGA of America, to 
suspend play. 
</P>
<P>
Rain has accompanied the PGA Tour at 19 of 35 events this year. "It's happened 
so often," Reid said, "I'm almost numb to it." 
</P>
<P>
Lightning and rain resulted in a one-hour 48-minute suspension of play Friday. 
Kemper Lakes, located 46 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, is only one of 
several Chicago-area courses plagued by lightning in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, four golfers, huddling under an umbrella at a golf course in 
west suburban Darien, were struck by lightning. One of them, 31-year-old 
Michael Pondel, died Friday of injuries suffered in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Three more golfers were struck by lightning at a golf course in nearby Wheaton 
the day Pondel died. Local hospital officials upgraded the conditions of two of 
them from critical to fair Saturday. The third was upgraded from critical to 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering what's happened in the area the last few days, you can't blame him 
(Strange)," said Paul Orseck, the director of communications for the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the storm Saturday, local power lines went down, shutting off 
electricity at most of the Kemper Lakes facilities, including the clubhouse. 
The outage lasted 90 minutes, during which time most of the players stayed in a 
candle-illuminated locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Before the suspension of play, Australian Greg Norman, who survived the cut by 
one shot, began his customary weekend charge. Norman was seven under on his 
round until he double-bogeyed the 16th hole to finish with a 67. He was at four 
under par after three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Last month in Scotland, Norman birdied the first six holes of the final round 
at the British Open and finished with a 64. But he lost in a four-hole playoff 
to Mark Calcavecchia. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I've played I seem to get off to a slow start and play well on the 
weekend," Norman said. "I have no reason for it. Maybe I don't fire myself up 
in the early rounds." 
</P>
<P>
Norman's double bogey resulted from a drive into a bunker, followed by a 
five-iron hooked into trees. His pitch ran through the green, then he chipped 
back and two-putted for a six. The 16th, at 469 yards, has played tougher than 
any hole on the course this week. Seve Ballesteros, the 1988 British Open 
champion, was seven under through 52 holes and five under on the day. Others at 
seven-under were Scott Hoch (through 46 holes) and Mike Sullivan (through 51). 
</P>
<P>
Hoch is still living down the 3 1/2-foot putt he missed on the first playoff 
hole at the Masters. He lost to Nick Faldo on the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
But few people remember that Reid, who has never won a major, was leading that 
tournament with six holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Aoki, for one, likes Reid's chances. "He hits the ball straight, straight, 
straight," Aoki said. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, who shot a 68 Thursday, had a 40 on the front nine Saturday and 
was five over for the tournament through 51 holes. Jack Nicklaus was five under 
for the tournament through 46 holes. Tom Watson was five under through 45 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the tournament, 10 golfers still had a chance to qualify on points 
for an automatic berth to the 12-man U.S. Ryder Cup team. The team hopes to end 
a two-match Ryder Cup losing streak next month against the European team in 
England. Four of the players who still had a chance -- Joey Sindelar, Lanny 
Wadkins, Mark O'Meara and Ken Green -- missed the cut of 145. Sindelar and 
Wadkins both shot 148, O'Meara 147. Green simply didn't show up Saturday 
morning to complete his second round. He had double-bogeyed the 16th hole 
Friday night to go seven over for the tournament when play was halted because 
of darkness. He was disqualified. "The reason he didn't show up was obvious, he 
wasn't going to make the cut," said tournament director Scott Cain. "We have no 
problem with that." Green is not subject to a fine. Other players still in 
contention for the four, point-related automatic berths are: Payne Stewart, 
Mark McCumber, Steve Pate, Bruce Lietzke, Ben Crenshaw and Scott Hoch. The 
winner of the tournament gains an automatic Ryder Cup berth. And if that winner 
has already qualified on points, team captain Raymond Floyd will have two 
(instead of one) wild-card selections to fill out the roster. Six players -- 
Mark Calcavecchia, Curtis Strange, Chip Beck, Tom Kite, Paul Azinger and Fred 
Couples -- have already clinched spots on the team. Both Couples (146) and 
Azinger (153) missed the 36-hole cut. 
</P>
<P>
Other prominent players missing the cut included: Hal Sutton (146), Fuzzy 
Zoeller (147), Lee Trevino (149) and Bob Tway (149). Tway, Trevino and Sutton 
all won this tournament in the '80s. . . . The cut wasn't determined until 
early Saturday morning when the 24 players, stopped by darkness Friday, finally 
finished their second rounds.

SABATINI STAYS AROUND TO FACE NAVRATILOVA FOR CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the morning, there was a fire in the kitchen. In the evening, the lights on 
the court went out for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver made a quick decision. She would not wait for the flood. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to get out of here before something else happened," Shriver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So she did, riding out atop Gabriela Sabatini's looping topspin. All in all, it 
was a quirky semifinal Saturday at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, where 
Sabatini joined Martina Navratilova in today's final. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini beat Shriver, 6-4, 6-2, helped along the way with the lob of her life, 
and Navratilova steadied herself after a brief wobble to defeat Zina Garrison, 
6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
There is $60,000 at stake at Manhattan Country Club for either Sabatini or 
Navratilova, who holds a 10-3 margin in their prior meetings. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the final, Sabatini had to face only two break points from Shriver 
and she saved them both. The key to the match was a wonderfully placed lob that 
followed an easy missed volley by Shriver in the seventh game of the first set. 
</P>
<P>
Serving at 3-3, Shriver led, 40-15, but was taken to deuce. Then Sabatini 
lifted a lob that landed within the shadow of the baseline. Shriver's own lob 
went long. 
</P>
<P>
"The point before, the backhand volley was more important," Shriver said. "If I 
make it, I'm up, 4-3. Instead, boom, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Sabatini had to admire her lob. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was pretty good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini broke Shriver on the next point and went on from there. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver's repertoire was limited, but what she did, she did well. She captured 
a bug and released it in the first row and twirled a towel as a wave broke out 
in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wave of goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Navratilova was saying hello to her first hardcourt tournament final 
since the Australian Open in January. She cruised, sputtered and then 
accelerated again against Garrison, who was expected to make it closer. 
</P>
<P>
So now, the headband-to-headband record reads Navratilova 24, Garrison 1. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison came into the tournament bearing a belief that she is not really the 
No. 6 player in the world, and judging by her performance Saturday, Garrison is 
entirely correct. She should be ranked lower than that. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Garrison thought she should be ranked more like No. 4, but it's 
difficult to believe a player ranked that high would commit so many costly 
mistakes when Navratilova seemed ready to topple: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four break points for 3-0, and Garrison misses them all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for 5-1, and she sends a forehand approach wide. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three more points for 5-3, and she double-faults, pulls an easy forehand 
wide and drifts a forehand volley long. 
</P>
<P>
After all that, after losing the last five games, Garrison decided to take the 
next two weeks off to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have come here and lost in the first round and be really miserable," 
Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
When she was falling behind two service breaks to 4-1, Navratilova was thinking 
Garrison actually might be something else -- lucky. 
</P>
<P>
The net cord belonged to Garrison as she began the second set. Several shots 
played touch and go with the net cord. Then Garrison missed one, which 
Navratilova interpreted as a sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the tide had turned," Navratilova said. "Her luck had run out." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Navratilova knew she was rushing her serves, so she told 
herself to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
Vital to Navratilova was her service game at 0-2. It was a 25-point game that 
went to deuce 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
Although Navratilova was erratic -- one sequence went ace, double fault, double 
fault -- she pulled it out with a deft touch volley on the 10th deuce and a 
backhand crosscourt volley winner on her seventh game point. 
</P>
<P>
"That game helped me stay in the set," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Staying mentally in the match was another thing. Navratilova said her 
concentration faded in and out like poor radio reception. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova called her problems "lapses" and said she was thinking of 
"personal" things. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some weird thoughts going through my head," she said, refusing to 
elaborate, then adding cryptically: "Stuff you should not be thinking about, 
like death." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Garrison was thinking along the same lines after blowing so 
many chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to find out what it takes to have that killer instinct," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said she got only five hours' sleep Friday night and had to hit the 
snooze button on her clock radio a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when Navratilova was preparing oatmeal for breakfast, she had to break up 
a battle between her three dogs and her friend's cat. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably a better fight than the match. 
</P>
<P>
But today's final looks promising. Sabatini won the last time they played, 6-3, 
6-2, on clay at Amelia Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini's chillingly efficient backhand passing shots took their toll on 
Shriver, who was also impressed by the way Sabatini moves to her shots. 
</P>
<P>
"She hits and she's off," Shriver said. "I tend to hit and watch and them I'm 
off. I've got to eliminate that watch . . . not my Rolex."

ALABAMA STAKES AT SARATOGA; 
</P>
<P>
OPEN MIND CLOSES FOR 10TH WIN IN ROW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For those hard-to-please critics who had been complaining that Open Mind is a 
brilliant horse with a bland style, the 3-year-old filly responded with a 
gritty performance on a rainy day at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the stretch of the $232,400 Alabama Stakes, Open Mind's chances 
appeared to be as gloomy as the day itself. She was ahead of only one horse, 
stablemate Lea Lucinda. She trailed the front-running Dearly Loved by more than 
five lengths and was running in the middle of the track, where the muddy 
surface had the consistency of butterscotch pudding. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind had gone into Saturday's 109th Alabama with a nine-race winning 
streak dating to last November, but now, at 1-5 odds, she looked hopelessly 
beaten. Her critics were ready to add Open Mind's name to the list of fallen 
Saratoga favorites, which includes Man o' War, Gallant Fox and Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Before a crowd of 30,309, Open Mind chose not to become a part of that gallery. 
"Of all the fillies I've ridden," Angel Cordero would say later, "I've never 
been on one who tries as hard as this filly. If she were a person, she'd want 
to work seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
Cordero went to his whip 16 times -- seven times from the right and nine from 
the left -- and it took that 16th whack to get owner Gene Klein's filly to the 
wire, a neck before Dearly Loved. Open Mind might win 10 more races in a row, 
if she is allowed to stay on the track long enough, but no victory will come 
any harder than Saturday's. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Cruguet was aboard Dearly Loved, who had won only two races in her life, 
neither in a stake. "Yeah, I sag the other filly coming," Cruguet said of Open 
Mind. "I wanted to shoot her." 
</P>
<P>
At the head of the stretch, Open Mind was so far to the center of the track 
that Cordero couldn't see Dearly Loved ahead because Cruguet's filly was toward 
the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see the second-place horse (Naskra's Return), but not the other one," 
Cordero said. "I was hoping my filly could see the leader, because it would 
give her something to run at." 
</P>
<P>
As Open Mind began closing the gap, Cordero was saying to her between blows 
from the whip: "Look at her (Dearly Loved), look at her. Don't let her beat 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, a $150,000 yearling purchase by trainer Wayne Lukas, won her 12th 
race in 14 starts, earned $139,440 and increased her purses to $1.7 million. 
The winning time was 2:04 1/5, with all the starters carrying 121 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Dearly Loved finished 1 3/4 lengths in front of Dream Deal, who was five 
lengths better than Lea Lucinda. Next were Silent Classic, Rose Park and 
Naskra's Return. Nite of Fun was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
In her three races before Saturday, Open Mind had become the seventh horse to 
sweep New York's filly triple by winning the Acorn, the Mother Goose and the 
Coaching Club America Oaks. Before Saturday, only two of the previous winners 
of that series, Shuvee in 1969 and Mom's Command in 1986, had gone on to take 
the Alabama. Chris Evert and Davona Dale, other winners of the triple, were 
knocked off in the Saratoga race, and Dark Mirage and Ruffian didn't run in the 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind paid $2.40, $2.20 and $2.10. Dearly Loved paid $4.80 and $2.10, and 
Dream Deal returned $2.10. The $2 exacta on Open Mind and Dearly Loved was 
worth $13.80. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a super filly," said Jeff Lukas, who saddled Open Mind for his father 
Saturday. "We wanted to run more of our own style today. She's best when she 
sits back and makes one run. Angel cut it pretty close, but he used everything 
to get her there. It was the filly's heart that got her up today." 
</P>
<P>
Naskra's Return, running slow fractions of :49 3/5 for the half-mile and 1:15 
for three-quarters, was on the lead down the backstretch, with Dearly Loved 
second and Rose Park third. Open Mind was sixth, ahead of only Lea Lucinda, and 
seven lengths behind Naskra's Return, after six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero went to his whip coming out of the final turn. He thought about moving 
Open Mind to the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutting the corner would have been better," Cordero said. "But the horses in 
front of me looked like they were hanging and they were spread across the 
track. I couldn't afford to get stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the sixteenth pole, Dearly Loved was drifting badly, but Cruguet still 
felt that they had a chance to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Open Mind would be there sooner or later," Cruguet said. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Jolley, who trains Dearly Loved, won the Kentucky Derby in 1980 with a 
filly, Genuine Risk. Late Saturday, Jolley was asked how Open Mind compares 
with some other top fillies. 
</P>
<P>
"She wouldn't have that record unless she was a real good horse," Jolley said. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
With each victory by Open Mind, trainer Wayne Lukas has second thoughts about 
the decision not to run her in the Kentucky Derby. Lukas believes that Open 
Mind is a horse-of-the-year candidate, conceding that someone would have to 
knock off Easy Goer for her to enter the picture. . . . There are no immediate 
plans for Open Mind, but she probably will have an easier schedule before the 
Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park in November. She's eight for eight this year, 
and her last loss was to stablemate Some Romance in the Frizette at Belmont 
Park last Oct. 15. . . . All 10 races in Open Mind's streak have been stakes. 
Undefeated Colin won 14 consecutive stakes in 1907-08. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas won another stake Saturday when Julie Krone rode Carson City to a 7 
1/4-length victory in the $200,000 Sapling at Monmouth Park. Mr. Nasty was 
second, and Adjudicating finished third. . . . Another Lukas horse, Steinlen, 
is favored to win the Bernard Baruch Handicap on the grass today at Saratoga. . 
. . The rain at Saratoga might continue through Tuesday. . . . Quick Call won 
the Devil Diver Handicap for Cordero at Saratoga Saturday, giving the 
5-year-old gelding seven victories in eight starts at the track in the last two 
years.

BERGER UPSETS EDBERG IN U.S. HARDCOURT SEMIFINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Berger upset top-seeded Stefan Edberg, 6-4, 6-2, and John McEnroe took 
another step in his drive to regain the world's No. 1 ranking by defeating 
Aaron Krickstein, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), Saturday in the semifinals of the U.S. 
Hardcourt Championships at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, seeded second, plays Berger, No. 5, in today's title match. 
</P>
<P>
Berger had to wait through a rain delay of 2 hours 40 minutes to defeat Edberg, 
the world's third-ranked player. The match was delayed by heavy rain and hail 
after Berger won the first set, 6-4, and took a 1-0 lead in the second set with 
a service break. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, ranked No. 22 in the world, held serve in the first game after play was 
resumed. After Edberg held, Berger won the next three games for a 5-1 lead. 
Edberg held in the seventh game, but Berger closed out the 77-minute match on 
his second opportunity when Edberg was wide with a return. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who had lost only 14 games and one set in reaching the semifinals, 
lost only eight points as he took the first five games in just 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe won 92% of his successful first serves in the opening set. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Krickstein took a 5-3 advantage before McEnroe came back to 
force the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave McEnroe, 29-4 in tour matches this year and ranked sixth in 
the world, a chance for his third championship of 1989 and his 75th overall as 
he tunes up to seek a fifth U.S. Open title. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Brad Gilbert broke fourth-seeded Jim Courier five times in seven 
chances in a 6-2, 6-0 victory to advance to the final of the Swiss Army Knife 
Open at West Orange, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, the No. 9 player in the world, needed just 66 minutes to eliminate 
Courier after rain delayed their match 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert will meet Jason Stoltenberg of Australia in today's final. Stoltenberg

<P>
"I hammered him," Gilbert said. "I hammered him in every phase of the game."

Stoltenberg will be making his first Grand Prix final appearance.

MCENROE CRITICIZES U.S. EFFORT IN DAVIS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
John McEnroe, who reached the final of the U.S. Hardcourt in Indianapolis 
Saturday, is upset that the United States didn't reach the final of the Davis 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a shoulder injury, McEnroe missed the U.S. semifinal match in 
Munich, where Boris Becker led a 3-2 West German victory. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe told ESPN that Michael Chang should have replaced him and also 
questioned Andre Agassi's play. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was asked to play but chose not to because of a lack of preparation. 
Agassi's 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 loss to Carl-Uwe Steeb gave West Germany an 
insurmountable 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Where was Chang?," McEnroe said. "Why wasn't he there? I'm very surprised that 
he wasn't there, and the effort that Agassi showed in the last match was very 
surprising. And I think that doesn't help Davis Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi had trailed Steeb, 5-0, in the fourth set. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said it was painful to watch the Davis Cup on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I could have made a difference," he said. "I feel like one of my 
strengths is that I'm a team player . . . and that I can get the other guys up. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see that was really missing. There were a lot of lost souls over 
there."

NEWSWIRE: SEAHAWKS' BURSE FAILS DRUG TEST, OUT 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second-year fullback Tony Burse, trying to earn a spot on the Seattle Seahawks 
roster, was suspended for 30 days by the National Football League for violating 
the league's substance abuse policy, the NFL said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were notified by the league Friday that Burse, who will not be 
allowed to practice with the team until Sept. 6, had tested positive for drugs 
in the NFL's mandatory preseason test. It was not known what substance was 
found in the test. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Knox refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma said the league told the Seahawks that Burse 
was a "Step Two" violator, meaning it was the second time he had failed a test 
since NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle implemented his drug plan last year. A 
30-day suspension is mandatory for second-time violators. 
</P>
<P>
If Burse failed a third test, he would be banned from football for an 
indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
Burse failed one test during training camp last year. 
</P>
<P>
Burse, 24, has not practiced with the Seahawks since suffering an ankle injury 
during practice Tuesday. He did not play in the team's 16-10 overtime victory 
over Phoenix in Tempe, Ariz., Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 220-pound Burse, from Middle Tennessee State, was a 12th-round 
draft pick of the Seahawks in 1987. He made Seattle's roster for the 1987 
season and played in 12 games, mainly on special teams, but was cut during the 
1988 exhibition season. He also tested positive for drugs for the first time 
during that period.

IF COACHES CAN'T BE STRAIGHT SHOOTERS, MAYBE PLAYERS CAN IN SOCCER FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Even the winners made excuses after the first round of the Marlboro Cup soccer 
tournament Thursday night at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Juventus Coach Dino Zoff, whose 22-time Italian League champions beat the 
United States, 2-0, said that his team needs considerable work on its 
conditioning before it is ready to open the regular season two weeks from 
today. Mexico's interim coach, Mario Velarde, whose team beat South Korea, 4-2, 
said that his players have not been together long enough to play as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
Their comments are hardly designed to inspire enthusiasm for tonight's 
championship game at the Coliseum at 6. (The United States meets South Korea 
for third place at 4 p.m.). But since neither Zoff nor Velarde is a novice in 
international soccer, it could be that each is trying to lull the other. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that Velarde made similar comments Wednesday, 24 hours 
before he unleashed his secret weapon, forward Ricardo Pelaez, who scored all 
four of Mexico's goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know him," Zoff said Friday. "But he doesn't need any introduction by 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone outside Mexico knew Pelaez before Thursday night. Although he is 
25, he was playing in his first international game. Velarde explained that 
Pelaez, who plays for Necaxa in Mexico's professional league, comes from a 
family in Mexico that insisted he complete his education before beginning a 
soccer career. 
</P>
<P>
Velarde said that he was not particularly impressed with his team's victory in 
the first round, saying that the South Koreans had contributed greatly to their 
own defeat. 
</P>
<P>
When the subject turned to excuses, the South Koreans should have been first in 
line. But they were not represented in a news conference Friday at Torrance 
because, a tournament official explained, they had "lost face" the previous 
night in their loss. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, their biggest problem in recent days has been lost sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Since receiving a cordial welcome at Seoul last year for the Summer Olympics, 
the Soviets have been encouraging more sports contacts between themselves and 
the South Koreans. The South Korean national soccer team found a break in its 
schedule week before last, flew to Moscow, took an 11-hour train ride to the 
Ukraine for a game Aug. 3, returned on the same train to Moscow for another 
game Aug. 7 and then went to the airport for a 20-hour trip to Los Angeles, via 
London. 
</P>
<P>
"Our match against Mexico was horrible," South Korea's team leader, Huh P. 
Sung, said. "But I understand, because my boys couldn't eat and couldn't sleep 
before the game." 
</P>
<P>
Huh said he realized that his team's play was a disappointment for Los Angeles' 
large Korean community, which was expecting to see the Asian power at its best. 
In six qualifying games for next year's World Cup in Italy, South Korea is 
undefeated.

"I've been getting many calls from Koreans in Los Angeles," Huh said. "Somebody 
told me, 'If you lose, don't come back here again.' I understand that our 
result was horrible for them because they wanted to beat the Mexicans. Their 
pride was hurt when we lost." 
</P>
<P>
Huh said his team would like to compensate them with a victory over the United 
States. But he was not overconfident. For one thing, he said, he fears his team 
will still be sapped by its travels, despite a couple of days off. For another, 
he said, the United States is no longer a pushover. That was evident to the 
South Koreans last year, when the Americans played them to a scoreless tie in 
an Olympic game at Taegu, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three years ago, we thought we could beat the Americans too easily," 
Huh said. "But now, I don't know whether we can beat them easily."

LISA, SHELLEY and Corey -- no last names, please -- sit at a patio table, 
shaded from the San Bernardino sun by a red-and-white Coors umbrella, sipping 
beer and taking in the show. On the baseball field a few feet in front of them, 
Mark Merchant, a young outfielder for the San Bernardino Spirit, pounds a pitch 
to the distant fence, runs to second base, and pauses to smooth out his 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"The Merchant of Menace!" Lisa says. 
</P>
<P>
"He's cute," Corey says. 
</P>
<P>
The Spirit are thumping their archrivals, the Riverside Red Wave, but the 
baseball action almost seems a sideshow. The young women cheer as a voice 
blasts from giant speakers mounted above every section of seats at this old 
municipal ballpark, Fiscalini Field. "Make a considerably large amount of noise 
for Brrrryyyyyan Kingggg!" the voice screams as the Spirit shortstop walks up 
to bat. 
</P>
<P>
Between innings the crowd sings along to high-volume comic Sam Kinison's 
version of "Wild Thing," while a mascot with a huge baseball for a head, a 
middle-age paunch and a Spirit jersey with his name and number -- The Bug, 00 
-- dances atop the third-base dugout. When the opposing manager meets with his 
team at the pitching mound, the fans hear muttering followed by one 
intelligible phrase -- "Who had the cheeseburger?" Young women called Diamond 
Girls cool off spectators with huge squirt guns, bring drinks to the umpires 
and sweep dust off the bases. "Cleaning up after the boys," the speaker voice 
observes, " . . . simply irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
It's Sunday afternoon in the California League, a link to the 1940s and '50s 
when creaky buses ferried young ballplayers and their illusions up and down 
Highway 99 through sweltering San Joaquin Valley summer nights. Then, as now, 
The Cal, as the league is called, sat near the bottom of America's many layers 
of minor leagues. It's a place where 19-year-old hotshots learn the niceties of 
professional baseball and 28-year-old has-beens come to grips with their 
lapsing talents. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, in towns skipped over by the major leagues, 10 teams with names 
such as the Oaks, the Spurs and the Ports will play 142 games each. They will 
be accompanied by rock music (mostly old, mostly Motown), the best promotional 
gimmickry their small budgets will allow and a better-than-big-league vendor 
menu -- mesquite-grilled chicken and ribs in San Jose, steaks barbecued to 
order in Stockton, Haagen-Dazs ice cream bars in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
But the crowds will be small and the impact minimal. All last summer, the 
Visalia Oaks barely sold as many tickets as the Dodgers sell on a good Thursday 
night. Sometimes no sportswriters show up. Of the 10 teams, only the Reno 
Silver Sox will air all their games on radio, and then on a Christian station 
that can be heard from one end of town to the other but no farther. 
</P>
<P>
No one could confuse this with major league baseball. And it's not just that a 
mongrel puppy called Bully lives in the Riverside bullpen and darts into the 
outfield during games. Or that San Jose fans are entertained between innings by 
Smash for Cash, winning money and testing their arms trying to break the 
headlights of a panel truck parked in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction between California League teams and their big-city, big-league 
cousins is less obvious. In The Cal, winning isn't that important. Baseball 
here is less a team sport than an individual one. That's because most of the 
players are being paid by major league ballclubs that are cultivating talent, 
not looking for a minor league pennant. 
</P>
<P>
The score is almost irrelevant. What counts is who got experience, who shone in 
the box scores, who performed. 
</P>
<P>
This concept eludes most fans, including Lisa, Shelley and Corey, who look 
forward to seeing the Spirit in the playoffs in September. "Of course they're 
trying to win," Lisa says. "What do you mean?" 
</P>
<P>
IT'S ABOUT 6 p.m., and the sun is falling behind the tall high oak trees that 
shade central Visalia, but the April air is still warm, close to 80 degrees. 
The thwack of ball against bat rings across Giddings Avenue, a quiet street 
near the center of town. Along the railroad tracks in front of Dollar K Check 
Cashing -- "If we can't cash it, trash it," the sign says -- two boys on bikes 
scan the sky to see if an errant baseball is falling their way. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden behind a fence across the tracks, on the deep grass of Recreation Park, 
the 1989 Visalia Oaks prepare for their first game before the home folks. The 
team owner isn't coming, nor is the mayor. But 1,214 people will be there, the 
biggest opening-night crowd in Visalia in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Visalia's place in minor league lore was established by a couple of lines of 
dialogue in last summer's hit movie "Bull Durham." Near the end of the film, 
the over-the-hill minor league catcher played by Kevin Costner tells his 
girlfriend, Susan Sarandon, that he wants to prolong his baseball life as the 
manager in Visalia, perhaps a stepping stone to a career as a manager in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
The real Visalia manager is something of a local celebrity. Now 33, Scott 
Ullger played on the Oaks' last championship team in 1978 and met his wife here 
before other minor league stops and a brief visit in the big leagues. Tall and 
trim in his tailored white Oaks uniform, he looks as strong and fit as his 
much-younger players. He came back to Visalia last year and took up managing 
after facing the fact that, as professional baseball players go, he was nothing 
special. 
</P>
<P>
His charges are 18 Americans from eight states -- a mix of college boys and 
players who graduated from high school into full-time baseball -- plus four 
Japanese, a Puerto Rican and two infielders from the Dominican Republic. The 
oldest of the 25 Oaks is a backup catcher from the Bay Area, Mike Dotzler, 25; 
the youngest is a raw, strapping 18-year-old pitcher from rural Japan, Kiyoshi 
Sagawa, whose American baseball nickname is "Country." 
</P>
<P>
The pitching coach, Gorman Heimueller, is another 33-year-old "retired" player 
who spent most of his career bouncing around the minors. He and his wife moved 
45 times in his playing days, two moves for every game he pitched in his 
painfully brief major league stops with the Oakland A's. The rest of the Oaks 
entourage includes a trainer who soothes aches and does odd jobs, a coach from 
Japan and a Japanese interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Players in Visalia make at least $850 a month -- some earn more -- but most 
make the minimum even with wives and children to support, plus $11 a day for 
meals. Bats, balls and uniforms are free. Some have cars they bought with the 
bonuses they got for signing to play professional baseball, and the most 
promising talents get free fielding gloves from the Rawlings sporting goods 
company. The younger ones think it's all a pretty good deal. The older ones 
come to regard it as a sometimes frustrating, sometimes pleasant way to avoid a 
9-to-5 job. 
</P>
<P>
All but the Japanese are paid by the Minnesota Twins, which sent them off to 
the San Joaquin Valley in the hope that talents will ripen in the sun like 
Tulare County peaches. It's a mutually advantageous business arrangement known 
as the baseball farm system. The Twins, which have more than 100 players under 
contract around the country, need a place for their developing athletes to play 
with others of similar experience. The Twins supply the players and manager. 
The corporation that is the Visalia Oaks supplies the ballpark and fans (and, 
in this case, the four Japanese players under a side arrangement with the Tokyo 
Giants). The California League provides umpires and suitable opponents for the 
season that runs from April to the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
Oaks general manager Bruce Bucz would love for his team to win all of their 
games. He is one of the few people connected with the Oaks whose fortune is 
tied to the team's success. If they win, he can sell more tickets and outfield 
billboards, his father can sell more programs from his booth inside the front 
gate, and his mother can move more burgers from her concession stand. "Winning 
is the best promotion," Bucz says. 
</P>
<P>
But the Twins don't care if the Oaks make money or keep Visalia entertained. 
They need ballplayers. So after every game, before he goes to sleep, Ullger 
dictates a report to a phone machine in Minnesota. The Twins want to know the 
daily progress of big-money investments such as Willie Banks, the Oaks' tall, 
20-year-old pitching super-phenom from New Jersey, or outfielder David Jacas, a 
thin New Yorker with an easy California smile who is back for a second summer 
in Visalia. Ullger reports on the lesser prospects as well -- who hits home 
runs, who strikes out, who doesn't listen to advice, who is lazy. 
</P>
<P>
Ullger might be ordered by Minnesota to sit an older, more seasoned player in 
the dugout so a younger, rawer talent can get some experience. A troubled young 
pitcher may be left in a game to give up 10 runs because, as Ullger says, 
"Minnesota wants him to get his 100 pitches." The Cal League is a proving 
ground, and not just for players. Half of last year's managers have moved up or 
out, and even umpires rarely stay two years. 
</P>
<P>
Players who get good reports might move closer to the big leagues. The Cal is 
at the Single A level of the farm system, three promotions removed from The 
Show. The best, or the luckiest, Oaks will move up this summer to the Twins' 
Double A team, in Orlando, Fla. From there the next step is Triple A in 
Portland, Ore. But some will take a downward path. Most of the Oaks came to 
Visalia from another Twins Single A team in Kenosha, Wis., where the 
competition is easier than in The Cal. If the reports aren't favorable, they 
could slip back down the ladder. Or worse, they could be pulled aside one day 
by Ullger and told to pack: Minnesota no longer thinks they have a future in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
At the home opener tonight, the Oaks starting pitcher is Bob Strube. A rarity 
in The Cal, he has been stalled in Visalia for three seasons, long enough to 
become acquainted with San Joaquin Valley vegetable growers who sell to his 
father's produce market in Chicago. His introduction draws a loud cheer. "They 
know me in Visalia. I don't know if that is good or bad," he says later, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Strube doesn't strut any major league stuff tonight. After an inning and a 
half, Modesto leads, 4-3. The game takes more than three hours to finish, in 
part because of 13 walks and five errors. But the Oaks hang on to win 9-6. The 
fans go home happy, the players return to their cramped apartments to wait for 
tomorrow's game. Ullger calls in good reports on Jacas, the young outfielder 
from New York who had three hits, and catcher Lenny Webster, a stubby 
Southerner who may be the team's best prospect. 
</P>
<P>
FOUR WEEKS later, on a cool May night, the Visalia Oaks' bus winds through the 
dark streets of Stockton, bound for home after three games on the road. The 
Oaks won tonight, and a little after 11 p.m. the bus stops in front of a 
mini-mart and gas station next to Highway 99. Dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 Oaks in postgame jeans and sweaters -- including all the Caribbean and 
Japanese players -- queue at the drive-up window of a Taco Bell to stock up on 
burritos and tacos. "They won't open the doors," Ullger complains. Another 
group invades the mini-mart, filling their hands with doughnuts, chocolate 
milk, Cokes, potato chips and microwaved sandwiches. "I don't even want to know 
what they're eating," says trainer Rick McWayne. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Strube's wife, Lisa, a small blond woman with a degree in biology, leans 
against her car. She and another wife drove more than 150 miles from Visalia 
that afternoon to see the game, and now will follow the bus three hours back 
home. Lisa has held odd jobs in Visalia, clinging to the belief that this life 
is temporary, that the call will come. But after three years here, Bob has a 
record that is still not the kind that makes for invitations to the major 
leagues, and she sounds tired of the life. 
</P>
<P>
"They told Bob he was going to go to Orlando, then they sent him back here," 
she says. "They tell him he won't be here very long. But, I don't know -- at 
the end of the year he needs to re-evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
For the Oaks, the day began 16 hours earlier at the Stockton Inn. Jacas got up 
early to collect the team's dirty uniforms and $1 from each player. He went off 
in the team bus to find a Laundromat, a chore usually done by McWayne, who 
pleaded illness this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Jacas is a thin outfielder with short hair who seems to cope with minor league 
life as well as anyone, but he came back from the laundry unhappy. His 
teammates had tried to sneak in extra pieces without paying, he complained. 
They in turn groused that Jacas didn't do the uniforms right. The griping 
heated into an argument -- and almost to blows -- before Jacas left to sit 
alone on a parking lot curb and cool off reading a book. 
</P>
<P>
At midday the entire team checked out of their rooms and crammed their 
equipment and themselves into a couple of "layover" rooms. They lay around on 
beds and the floor, watched soap operas and game shows, and spilled into the 
motel corridor, waiting for the bus to leave for the Stockton ballpark about 4 
o'clock. Relief pitcher Rob Wassenaar, a clean-cut, spectacled Stanford 
economics graduate, worked crosswords. The Japanese devoured Cokes and stuck to 
themselves, their only communication with teammates through interpreter Acey 
Kohrogi, a young Gardena native who helps them handle American landlords, 
waitresses and coaches. The Oaks spend more time waiting than playing baseball. 
Waiting for the bus, waiting in the dugout to get called into a game, waiting 
for that call from the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Throw together 25 young athletes with time to burn, and anything might happen. 
This afternoon, someone kidded Carlos Capellan, a 21-year-old Dominican with 
strong Caribbean features, calling him "Duck Lips." In the roughhousing that 
followed, Capellan ran hard into a fire extinguisher. His right shoulder 
swelled visibly, and the fun was over. Cappy has major league talent and had to 
play tonight or Minnesota would want to know why. His teammates helped wrap ice 
on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
When the bus finally departed for Stockton's Billy Hebert Field, the Oaks left 
behind nearly a cubic yard of potato chip wrappers, soda cans and newspapers. 
They were wearing their practice uniforms -- blue hand-me-downs from Minnesota 
that say Twins, not Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three hours, the Oaks and Stockton Ports enjoyed one of baseball's 
more exquisite leisures. They wandered between the field and the adjoining 
clubhouses behind the center-field fence, taking hitting and fielding practice, 
loosening up arms and hamstring muscles. In the Stockton clubhouse, players in 
stages of undress played cards. Outside, four Ports hit an old, empty baseball 
cover with a splintered bat, a game they might have used to while away summer 
afternoons as 10-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the Oaks dugout, pitching coach Heimueller chatted with Rob Wassenaar's 
father, Carl, who drove two hours from the Bay Area hoping he could see his son 
pitch tonight. He'd hoped to say hello, but Rob -- the resident Oaks brain -- 
was in the tiny clubhouse, still working crosswords. Carl wouldn't intrude. 
"Never," Carl says. "This is his job now." 
</P>
<P>
Only about 1,000 fans turned out to see the Oaks and Ports. It was a Thursday 
night, which means cash for every Ports hit. Before each batter a new lucky 
number was called. The fan with the number printed in his score card got $10 
for a single, $20 for a double, $30 for a triple and $50 for a home run. "It's 
an old promotion," says Stockton general manager Don Miller. "I just brought it 
back." (Miller also lured Morganna the Kissing Bandit, the woman known for 
planting kisses on players at televised sports events, to visit Stockton later 
in the summer. "This is her first minor league appearance," says Miller, who 
cut his teeth in the promotion business as road manager for the famous San 
Diego Chicken. "I'm pretty happy about that.") 
</P>
<P>
Carl Wassenaar watched the first few innings from a seat behind the Oaks 
dugout, then paced. Fans don't appreciate the minor leagues, he said. "They 
should watch the players more, not care so much about wins. There are some good 
players out there." 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, Rob took the mound for Visalia with the game tied 1-1. 
In the eighth, he faced as fearsome a hitter as there is in The Cal this year, 
John Jaha, a thick-muscled first baseman. Jaha is the Ports' only .300 hitter, 
and he leads the league in home runs and crushed a home run earlier in the 
game. Wassenaar struck him out. "It was the classic confrontation, and he beat 
him!" said Carl proudly, his jacket zipped against the cool, moist air here on 
the edge of the San Joaquin River delta, a cup of coffee in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Wassenaar went five strong innings and the Oaks won 2-1. Father and son 
embraced by the dugout and talked as the stadium emptied. 
</P>
<P>
Ullger's report to Minnesota included praise for the right hander. "He should 
be a starter," Ullger says later. But that's not his decision to make. 
Minnesota, which traded big league veteran Bert Blyleven to get Wassenaar from 
the California Angels farm system last winter, still wants him in the bullpen 
so others can start. 
</P>
<P>
THE WHITE limousine swings right off Giddings Avenue and stops in the parking 
lot of Recreation Park. Out steps Don Drysdale, the famous Dodger pitcher and 
new owner of the Visalia Oaks. Drysdale started out in the California League 35 
summers ago, a 17-year-old giant from Van Nuys. He pitched 15 games for 
Bakersfield, and remembers open-air dressing rooms and "the biggest mosquitoes 
in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
This pleasant June evening, Drysdale has taken the night off from his job as a 
Dodger broadcaster to make his first visit to Visalia since buying the Oaks 
last spring. In an hour the California League All-Star game will be played at 
Recreation Park. Drysdale came to sign autographs, enjoy cocktails with other 
California League owners and be introduced to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
His purchase of the Oaks -- with a Japanese partner -- is a sign of changing 
times in the California League, just as the outfield fence billboards for 
divorce lawyers, chemical dependency units, flavored seltzer water and computer 
stores reflect the transformation of the towns where The Cal plays. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Cal League teams were owned by local people who regarded 
their stewardship as a civic contribution. Nobody made much money. The Oaks 
were even owned for a time by the city of Visalia. But when Drysdale bought the 
Oaks, they became the fourth Cal League team to change hands since last season, 
the sixth since 1987. Last time the Oaks were sold, in 1982, two local 
businessmen paid about $20,000. Drysdale paid more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are climbing because demand is high for minor league baseball teams. 
Between dream-struck baseball fans and investors looking to cash in on what's 
become a desirable commodity, there are more potential buyers than there are 
teams. "It's almost like a rare painting," says Stockton general manager Don 
Miller. "A lot of people want to own a baseball team, and there aren't that 
many to go around." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, buyers have included actor Mark Harmon, who acquired the 
Ventura Gulls and moved them to San Bernardino (changing their name to Spirit) 
after trying unsuccessfully to buy the Oaks. "Harmon handed me a cashier's 
check for $325,000, but we turned him down," says Stan Simpson, the Visalia 
insurance broker who sold to Drysdale. The Stockton Ports are owned by 
prominent political liberals from the Westside of Los Angeles -- including 
attorney Geoff Cowan, District Attorney Ira Reiner and former Democratic Party 
leader Mickey Kantor. The majority owner of the Palm Springs Angels is Bruce 
Corwin, a Democratic activist and chairman of Metropolitan Theaters. 
</P>
<P>
For some owners, just being part of baseball is the lure. Burton Boltuch, an 
Oakland labor lawyer, is the lead partner in the Modesto A's. He regularly 
drives an hour east from Oakland to see his team play. As a youth in New York 
he had been a hawker at the old New York Polo Grounds and at Yankee Stadium. He 
shopped for a team through a broker who specializes in matching teams with fans 
who want to become baby-baseball moguls. Reports that he and his partners paid 
about $700,000 for the Modesto A's are about right, he says. "I've been looking 
for a number of years," Boltuch says. "It's been a lifelong passion." 
</P>
<P>
For some, the California League itself is the attraction. The league, a fixture 
in the San Joaquin Valley since 1941, is highly regarded for its competitive 
level -- many of baseball's biggest stars passed through The Cal. Cities even 
compete to lure Cal League teams. When the Fresno Suns, the league's oldest 
team, was sold after last season, Salinas beat out Ontario as the club's new 
home. The Cal would still like to move a team into Ontario, where city 
officials believe it would help their convention business. "We think it would 
add another attraction," city manager Dennis Wilkins says. 
</P>
<P>
But for Drysdale, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame, owning the ball team is 
all business. He had scoured the minor leagues for a team to buy, but he has 
yet to even see the team play. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that it's an investment," Drysdale says. "We were looking for anything 
that would be a good investment." 
</P>
<P>
WILLIE BANKS HAS as much of a future as anyone in the Oaks dugout. In 1987 at 
St. Anthony's High School in Jersey City, he blew the ball by hitters his own 
age, striking out two for every inning he pitched. That June he was the third 
player taken in baseball's national draft of new talent, the highest pick ever 
from New Jersey. He was a dominant pitcher last year in Kenosha. But this 
season in Visalia he got off to an awful start. Banks throws hard, maybe the 
hardest in The Cal. But he walked almost as many batters as he struck out the 
first six weeks and won only once. He was worried about moving up, about what 
they thought of him in Minnesota, he said later. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Visalia better than I liked Kenosha. But I came in here thinking, 'If I 
have a good first month, I'll get sent up,' " says Banks, wearing a large 
gold-colored pendant with his nickname, Big Daddy, spelled out. The coaches 
counseled patience, and, being no dummy, he listened. "So now I don't think 
about it. I just take it day to day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
One night in May, Banks put it all together. In his 47th game as a professional 
starting pitcher, Banks became the youngest California League pitcher ever to 
throw a no-hitter. His next time out, Banks allowed a hit, but only one. No one 
scored against Banks either game, or in his next game. Willie Banks had settled 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Most Cal League players are like Banks: eager and hopeful. But if Visalia and 
Stockton are where dreams gain strength, Reno is where those dreams cling to 
life. Reno's Silver Sox is full of men who know that even when it's almost 
hopeless, the vision of playing major league baseball is a hard thing to put 
behind you. It tugs at the heart and leaves you blind. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Warren, 28, has been on a slow slide since 1983, when as a major 
league rookie he pitched a no-hitter for the Oakland A's. Within two years his 
arm began to ache, and since 1985 he has been on a desperate journey across 
baseball's map of last chances. 
</P>
<P>
On a cool, drizzly May night in Reno, a wedge of geese flies north into a 
blowing mist, and Warren stays dry and warm, watching the game through a window 
in the Silver Sox clubhouse. He is pitching tomorrow, so tonight Warren is out 
of uniform, noting on a chart the pitches made by Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Warren is coming off the worst chapter of his baseball life, a brief stay last 
winter in Aguascalientes, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the only American," he says. "I was lost. I didn't speak the language. I 
missed my family. . . . I don't want to play somewhere where I can't see my 
family for four months. I can't have any of that noise. So I went home to 
Garden Grove." In April he found his way to Reno, the farthest point north on 
the Cal League circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Reno is where the extremes of Cal League life collide. California teams love to 
play there because the casinos offer the best late-night diversions and 
cheapest good food they can find on the road. The coffee shop at the Peppermill 
Hotel and Casino, visible behind the left field fence at Moana Stadium, serves 
the most popular meal in The Cal: all the steak and eggs you can eat after 
midnight for $4.95. But no one wants to play for Reno, the poor cousins of the 
California League. 
</P>
<P>
Reno is an independent team, one of only four in the minor leagues. Last season 
the Sox lost their contract with the San Diego Padres, in part because the 
Padres didn't like their young hopefuls playing in the decrepit Reno park. So 
instead of receiving 25 players, a manager and a coach free of charge, Reno is 
stocked with castoffs from other minor league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike teams with a major league benefactor, Reno has to pay for everything out 
of ticket and ad sales and the dwindling resources of the investors. "We have 
no trainer, no rubdowns, no massage," Warren says of the benefits typical 
elsewhere in baseball. "All we have is a physical therapist. He could probably 
do a good job, but he doesn't get here until the fifth inning." 
</P>
<P>
Players in Reno all make less than the $850 minimum paid to the Visalia Oaks. 
Independent teams may pay as little as $300 a month. "I don't have the heart to 
pay anybody $300," general manager Jack Patton says. "But I've got a few 
players at $350." Warren made $5,000 a month in the Milwaukee Brewers farm 
system after leaving Oakland. Now he gets a tenth of that, and his wife, Mary, 
and children, Ashley, 3, and Tyler, 2, stay home in Garden Grove to save money. 
He sees them on road trips down south. 
</P>
<P>
No one comes to Reno planning to stay the summer. Most hope to have a few good 
weeks and get noticed. If the Visalia manager likes what he sees on a trip to 
Reno, he might mention something to Minnesota that will trigger some interest. 
But Visalia isn't interested in Warren. "He's just a shell of the pitcher he 
was," says Ullger. "He has to start thinking about what he wants to do. He's 
almost 30 years old, he's still in Single A ball, and he has an 80-mile-an-hour 
fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Warren thinks about quitting to apply at the Orange County fire academy, but 
for now he stays. "I feel like I'm throwing as well as ever," Warren says. And, 
forgetting for a moment the alienation of playing in Mexico, he adds, "I'd like 
to go to Japan. I wouldn't want to make it a 10-year career, but I'd like to 
see what it's like for a year or two. I'm throwing as well as ever -- maybe not 
as fast." 
</P>
<P>
Warren's fellow pitcher Rubio Malone, a quiet, rail-thin left hander from 
Compton, turned 30 on that misty night in Reno. The Cal's oldest player, Malone 
was working at the Arco refinery in Carson, living in Long Beach motels and 
playing in Los Angeles park leagues when the season began. After playing last 
year in Cancun he was going to forget baseball. But this spring "the itch" got 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I can pitch with anybody in the majors," Malone says. "All I need is 
that one break to get there. Right now I feel I'm in my prime." 
</P>
<P>
But even the teams who see promise in his pitching don't agree. The Montreal 
Expos called Reno to ask about him but backed off quickly when they learned his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
For some, however, there is life after the Silver Sox. In April, the Milwaukee 
Brewers asked if a young Reno left hander, Tim Fortugno, could pitch against 
their Stockton farm team. Against Stockton, Fortugno struck out 13, and 
Milwaukee phoned Reno with an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Patton tried to get $4,000 to help pay some bills but finally sold Fortugno for 
$2,500 and 12 dozen baseballs. The pitcher was trying to support two children 
on $500 month, and, Patton says, "he really wanted to get out of here. I could 
have held out for more. But there's things that are more important than 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Most often, Reno is where the last wisps of the dream dissolve. Doug Carpenter, 
a blond Florida beach type, was bound for spring training one year with the New 
York Yankees when he was hurt in a car wreck. Three teams have now told 
Carpenter to get lost, but he wrote a letter to Patton this spring and 
eventually signed on as Reno's player-coach for $650 a month, the top salary on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the California League because I'd never been there before," 
Carpenter says. "Weather was a consideration. The caliber of ball is good; 
there are a lot of fans." 
</P>
<P>
But when the Silver Sox took a road trip through California in May, Carpenter 
went home to teach at the Bucky Dent Baseball School in Del Rey, Fla. Before he 
left, the manager took sick and Carpenter managed a ball team for the first 
time. The Sox stayed in the game until the last of the ninth inning before 
losing. For Carpenter it was end of game, season and career. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, as mid-season approached, Minnesota began shuffling 
players, sending some down to Kenosha. Infielder Vince Teixeira was cut loose 
and went home to Newhall before being picked up by the Salinas Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in June, the Oaks promotions began. Lenny Webster, the squat, 
hard-hitting catcher with a rifle arm and poise to match, went to Orlando, the 
first to move up. Star hitter David Jacas and lefty pitcher Doug Simons 
followed. And finally, the call came for reliever Rob Wassenaar, too -- they 
wanted him in Orlando, and as a starting pitcher. But Bob Strube decided that 
three summers were enough to spend pitching in Visalia and gave up baseball, 
going home to the produce business in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
At least part of Silver Sox player-coach Carpenter accepts that the call will 
never come for him. "I've had my shot," he says. "I like teaching kids. And 
I'll make in a week there what I make in a month here." 
</P>
<P>
But then he falls silent and reconsiders for a moment. "If somebody called and 
offered me a Double A job," he says, "I might do it."

JUSTICE PREVAILS; 
</P>
<P>
CRUZ REYNOSO WAS SWEPT OFF THE STATE SUPREME COURT WITH ROSE BIRD, BUT NOW HE'S 
FOUND NEW CAUSES AND A NEW CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Philip Hager is a Times staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE ATTORNEY moves purposefully to the lectern, preparing to present his case 
before a three-judge panel of the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice Reynoso, what an honor it is to have you argue before our court," says 
the presiding judge, smiling down from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, thank you, Your Honor," the attorney replies, "but on this occasion, I 
am Mr. Reynoso, rather than Justice Reynoso." 
</P>
<P>
Such exchanges are to be expected these days as Cruz Reynoso, swept out of 
office in a fiercely contested 1986 election, makes the transition from the 
California Supreme Court to a new role as lawyer, lecturer and activist. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, that defeat was a stunning setback for a man who had steadily 
advanced through his profession, becoming the first Latino to serve on the 
state high court. His was a judicial tenure that could have lasted decades, but 
in an unprecedented action, the voters rejected him and two other liberal 
justices. Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird became a television news 
commentator; Justice Joseph R. Grodin went back to teaching law, and Reynoso, 
after 10 years on the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, re-entered the 
world of the practicing attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 58-year-old former justice is generally regarded as one of the most 
prominent Latino lawyers in the state, at the forefront of civil-rights efforts 
ranging from immigration to integrating law firms. But his defeat remains much 
on his mind, and, although the wound may not be completely healed, he offers an 
extensive analysis of the election with surprisingly little bitterness or 
rancor. 
</P>
<P>
The most important factor in that election, he believes, was Gov. George 
Deukmejian's decision to oppose him, Bird and Grodin. Deukmejian and other 
critics were angry with the court's liberal record, especially on the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"The state's most important political figure, the governor, (concluded) that it 
was good for him politically to take on such a campaign," Reynoso says. "That 
freed up a lot of money for the opposition. They were able to raise several 
millions of dollars that otherwise would have been difficult to raise." 
</P>
<P>
Those millions played an important role in the election. Like other state 
appellate or Supreme Court justices, he went before the electorate for approval 
or rejection, rather than run against an opponent. Because voters are deemed to 
be more easily persuaded to vote "no" than "yes," Reynoso's advisers told him 
that it would take three pro-Reynoso campaign ads to counteract one ad by his 
opponents. But he lacked the money to buy anywhere near that volume of ads. In 
the end, campaign spending by opponents of the three justices reached about $7 
million, while proponents spent only about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso remains concerned about the long-term effects of the campaign. He 
believes that the traditional independence of the judiciary may have been 
undermined for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"What the future holds, we don't know," he says. "But it seems unlikely that 
the judges who are on the court now won't have in the back of their minds the 
fact that a political campaign may be launched against them if some powerful 
group in California becomes unhappy with a ruling they make. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel bitter," Reynoso says. "I never took the matter personally. The 
voters didn't really know who I was. All they knew is what the TV spots said 
about me . . . and you can't blame them when the governor of the state, who is 
a lawyer, says the justices aren't following the law. If I didn't know better, 
I would have voted against me, too." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't blunt the sting of losing. Robert L. Gnaizda, an attorney with 
Public Advocates Inc. of San Francisco, a longtime friend of Reynoso, observes: 
"I think he was disappointed most in the election because he felt that if the 
voters had judged him by his record alone, they would never have voted him 
down. He loved being a Supreme Court justice because it suited his aspirations, 
temperament and intellect. He has always been a contemplative person -- an 
activist, but always in a contemplative way. . . . But one of the great 
qualities about Cruz is that he has no streak of meanness or vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
Fate certainly played a part in Reynoso's ouster. His term coincided with 
Bird's, placing him on the ballot with one of the most controversial figures in 
recent California history. Had he come before the voters in some other 
election, he might have escaped defeat, as he did when he first went on the 
ballot in 1982 and won confirmation along with three other court members. 
</P>
<P>
And, Reynoso believes, news coverage of the election worked against him. "If I 
had to give out grades to the news media, they would go all the way from D to 
F," he says. "They treated it just like any political campaign, always focusing 
on whether people agreed or disagreed with certain opinions. . . . (The death 
penalty) should not have been the main issue, but that was the way it was posed 
by critics of the court, and it was picked up in that fashion by the media." 
</P>
<P>
In his view, reporters failed to convey that the justices should be evaluated 
not by the popularity of their decisions but by their competence, diligence and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
He says that too much attention was paid to the court's rulings on the death 
penalty (the Bird court reversed 64 of 68 capital sentences it reviewed), and 
too often the media gave the impression that convicted killers were being 
freed, when they were simply granted new trials. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that had he and his two colleagues remained on the bench, the Bird 
court would be affirming capital cases substantially more often than it had. By 
now, he says, the major constitutional questions about the law have been 
resolved and fewer procedural errors are occurring at trial, reducing the 
prospect for reversals. "Whether it was the (new) court or ours, the number of 
affirmances would go up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE high court, Reynoso's opinions often reflected concern for the rights of 
individuals involved in disputes with government authorities. His opinions were 
sometimes criticized privately by attorneys for lack of clarity, but he earned 
respect among many observers for his compassion. For example, he wrote the 
court's opinion in a case that gave homeowners the precedent-setting right to 
sue airports for jet noise that presents a "continuing nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote the decision that said an unmarried woman, like a spouse, can 
claim unemployment benefits when she quits her job to accompany the father of 
her children to another state. In a case that touched his own heritage, Reynoso 
held for the court that non-English-speaking defendants must be provided with 
an interpreter through all stages of a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of this state, through the clear and express terms of their 
constitution, require that all persons tried in a California court understand 
what is happening about them," he wrote. "Who would have it otherwise?" 
</P>
<P>
Since his defeat, he's redirected his concerns in his work for Kaye, Scholer, 
Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, a New York-based, 400-member firm with offices 
around the world. Reynoso works from the firm's third-floor office in the Old 
Sacramento section of the capital, but much of the time, he is on his way to or 
from airports, finding himself on planes an average of nearly once a week. 
</P>
<P>
He remains the cordial and outgoing man he was on the high court, a nonsmoking, 
nondrinking Baptist whose strongest statements, rendered with a slight Spanish 
accent, tend to be punctuated with the word golly. He is content to reside with 
his wife, Jeannene, and four children away from the big city on a 30-acre farm 
in Herald, 30 minutes by car from Sacramento. He reports with pleasure that, 
after two busy years, he is finding time once again for farm chores. "I spent a 
couple of hours irrigating the other day," he says with a laugh. "It was great 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
As an attorney, he conducts research on complex civil litigation, helps prepare 
briefs and occasionally argues cases on appeal. Clients have ranged from 
business people involved in property battles to low-income citizens contesting 
edicts from welfare officials. He also has served as a mediator in disputes 
between consenting parties and has testified in court as an expert witness on 
legal ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso acknowledges that his years on the bench are useful to him in the 
courtroom. "After being on the court, you know better how to structure an 
argument," he says. "You know what areas of law are more likely to concern the 
judges and what they will focus on in terms of issues." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent case before the state Court of Appeal, he won a decision giving two 
brothers he represented the right to pursue a lawsuit against a third brother 
in a dispute over the family's holdings. During argument before the court, he 
relished the friendly reception he received from the panel but was still 
concerned that he might lose the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the worst thing you can hear from a court is a compliment on your 
argument," he said with a smile. "That means they're going to rule against 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, I'd still be on the court," Reynoso says. "But in life, 
you take what's good and what's bad. And one of the good things now is that I 
can be active in many matters that a person can't be active in when one is a 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the law firm, Reynoso can spend as much as 40% of his 
time on pro bono activity, working for free in behalf of the public good. This 
frees the former justice, law professor and legal services administrator once 
again to express his lifelong zeal for reform. He serves on the boards of 
directors of several organizations, including the Latino Issues Forum, the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. He is a member of the California Post-Secondary Education 
Commission and participates on a commission of the State Bar on providing legal 
services to indigents. And he is also involved with a group formed to encourage 
private attorneys to take worthy cases for free. 
</P>
<P>
As board chairman of the Latino Issues Forum, he has taken a leading role in 
trying to persuade California law firms to hire and promote more Latino 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Representatives of some firms say to me, 'Hey, Cruz, what are you trying to do 
to us?' I tell them, 'Just a little consciousness-raising,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the forum publicly criticized the state's legal profession, citing a 
study that showed that while Latinos make up more than 20% of the population, 
they are only about 2% of the entry-level associates and 1% of the partners in 
the 30 largest firms in California. 
</P>
<P>
Forum leaders were taken aback by the initial response from the firms. "A 
majority of the firms were kind of irate and indignant," says John C. Gamboa, 
executive director of the group. "We received some fairly nasty letters 
adamantly opposed to any kind of goals and timetables for law firms." But since 
then, Gamboa says, some firms have indicated that they are reconsidering the 
issue and are drafting new affirmative-action plans. 
</P>
<P>
Conscious that law firms can't hire more minorities unless law schools produce 
more minority graduates, Reynoso also presses for what he sees as the need for 
more ethnic and cultural diversity on that level. Only about one student in 10 
attending law school today is Latino, black, Asian or American Indian. And 
Reynoso is concerned that efforts to increase minority enrollments are still 
falling short. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, speaking at UCLA School of Law, Reynoso said he was saddened by what 
he sensed as law schools' waning enthusiasm for attracting minorities. 
"Indeed," he said, "sometimes there seems to be an element of resentment that 
people of color are coming to the law schools and, they feel, displacing 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso is active in immigration issues, and he has played a leading role in a 
current campaign by the forum and other Latino organizations to persuade the 
Justice Department to form a "citizenship bureau" to assist immigrants in the 
naturalization process. Advocates of the new agency, concerned about a low rate 
of naturalization among Latinos, say more immigrants would try to become 
citizens if there were a federal bureau that actively promoted the benefits of 
naturalization. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso sees an inherent conflict in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service's performing the twin functions of assisting in the citizenship process 
and enforcing laws against illegal immigration. "There's an incongruity in 
having the INS being both the cop on the beat and at the same time being the 
social worker encouraging people to become citizens," he says. 
</P>
<P>
It was Reynoso who served as the primary spokesman for a delegation of Latino 
leaders that met recently with U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard L. Thornburgh in 
Washington in preliminary discussions about creating the citizenship bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"They spoke to each other across the table as equals," Gamboa recalls. "We're 
very lucky to have Cruz as the chair of our organization. Without him, we'd 
never have made the progress we have." 
</P>
<P>
REYNOSO KNOWS that progress often comes slowly, but he steadfastly believes 
that persistence and patience can result in reform. That is a lesson he says he 
learned as a boy, third eldest of 11 children of Mexican farm workers, when he 
led campaigns for mail delivery and a desegregated grade school. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that while he was a teen-ager living with his family in a small 
barrio near La Habra, the residents in his neighborhood were denied the rural 
mail delivery extended to non-minority families only a short distance away. 
After inquiring at the local post office, young Reynoso circulated a petition 
among neighborhood residents demanding service and sent it to Washington. A few 
months later, officials responded to the request, and mail began to be 
delivered to homes in the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
When Reynoso reached high school, he challenged a local school-board policy 
that through the years had assigned Latinos to a segregated grade school before 
they moved on to integrated junior and senior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, he says, the policy dimmed the aspirations of minority 
students who were young and impressionable. He remembers confiding to a friend 
his then-ambition to become a naval officer -- and that the friend had 
ridiculed the notion. "Cruz, they won't let you," he said in hushed Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso audaciously obtained meetings with school board members, who professed 
concern over possible racial violence at the school if it was integrated. He 
also met with community residents -- both Anglo and Latino -- who thought that 
the prospect of violence was far-fetched. A public meeting was called and the 
board, perhaps wary of a lawsuit, announced that the grade school would be 
desegregated. The audience, he remembers, cheered. 
</P>
<P>
The young Reynoso won a scholarship to Pomona College before going on to Boalt 
Hall Law School at UC Berkeley. In 1959, he began practicing law in El Centro, 
but moved on to serve as a government civil-rights attorney. He then became 
director of California Rural Legal Assistance, a trailblazing legal services 
agency that survived a funding challenge by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan to win wide 
acclaim within the legal profession. 
</P>
<P>
He later worked as a professor of labor and constitutional law at the 
University of New Mexico, and in 1976, he was appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown to 
the California Court of Appeal in Sacramento. In late 1981, he was named by 
Brown to the state Supreme Court, succeeding Mathew O. Trobriner, who had 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
But the incidents that shaped him, that continue to drive him, he says, are 
those early barrio battles for equality. 
</P>
<P>
"What sticks in my mind most vividly is that the people of the community, both 
Anglo and Mexican-American, were ready for the change," Reynoso recalls. "Those 
incidents gave me a sense of confidence that government does respond to a 
petition for grievances. I realized that so many of the adults were complaining 
only to themselves about how unfair government can be. So I said, 'Here's 
something that can be done.' And by golly, something did happen."

KEEP POLICE FROM DOING THE INS'S JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, the San Diego Police Department wisely abandoned its practice of 
detaining suspected illegal aliens for apprehension by the U.S. Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
As former Police Chief Bill Kolender said, the police "are not in the 
immigration business, and we are not immigration officers." 
</P>
<P>
With the change, San Diego became one of the last major U.S. border city police 
forces to drop the policy of detaining people just because they are suspected 
of being undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Then-assistant chief Bob Burgreen described the move as "severing the umbilical 
cord" with the Border Patrol. But now, as chief, he is proposing to reestablish 
a relationship with immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
He has proposed a policy whereby people arrested on suspicion of misdemeanors 
would be turned over to the Border Patrol if police think they are in the 
country illegally. There would be no change in the 1986 policy for those 
stopped for minor "infractions," such as jaywalking. They would not be turned 
over to the Border Patrol, Burgreen assures. 
</P>
<P>
But he maintains that the problem of crime by illegal aliens is sufficiently 
serious to merit a new policy on misdemeanors, such as trespassing, assault and 
minor thefts. 
</P>
<P>
(A recent San Diego Assn. of Governments study found that 12% of those arrested 
on felony charges in the county in the 1986 fiscal year were illegal aliens. No 
statistics are kept on misdemeanors.) 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the policy is to reduce crime, which is hard to argue with. But 
we question the method, which would treat illegal aliens differently than 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Because the county's jails are so overcrowded, very few misdemeanor suspects 
are booked. Instead, officers give them a citation with a court date and 
release them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed policy, if a suspect fits certain criteria, still being 
developed, the officer will bring him into the police station. If a lieutenant 
confirms that the criteria have been met, the suspect will be turned over to 
Border Patrol agents to determine whether the person is undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration authorities say that, unless the person can post bond, he will be 
held in a federal detention center -- an average of seven days -- until a 
deportation hearing. If the person is deported and reenters the United States 
illegally, he can then be prosecuted for a felony. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, U.S. citizens arrested for misdemeanors will go free, and 
illegal aliens will be jailed, because there is more room in federal detention 
centers than in county jails. 
</P>
<P>
This would seem to violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection 
under the law, regardless of immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
Police essentially will be deciding whether to hold people based on their 
perceived immigration status, rather than on criteria related to the offense. 
There is also the opportunity of abuse -- the possibility that officers' 
judgments will be swayed by the color of the suspect's skin. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, civil rights attorneys and others suggest that aliens' rights 
might be jeopardized if they are asked about their immigration status before 
receiving Miranda warnings. And the policy could make undocumented aliens who 
are victims of crime even more reluctant to report the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Burgreen is to be commended for the way in which he is developing this 
policy. He has solicited recommendations from Latino groups and the Citizens 
Advisory Board on Police-Community Relations. And he has cautioned officers 
about abusing the policy. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with careful criteria and safeguards against abuse, the policy is 
flawed. It would send a message that the end justifies the means, that unequal 
treatment is acceptable if it reduces crime. That's a concept our system of law 
should reject.

ILLEGAL ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your Aug. 6 editorial ("Keep Open a Window to Police"): "detaining 
illegal aliens who had committed no crime"? 
</P>
<P>
The last time I looked, it was a crime to enter this country without permission 
and proper papers. This is why those who enter without permission are called 
illegal aliens -- they are here illegally, having broken federal law in the 
process.

RETURN THE TAX

<P>
Should a citizen become involved in a tax dispute with the government and lose 
his case, that person must post the amount of the monetary judgment, as a bond, 
to appeal his case to a higher court.

<P>
The County of San Diego lost its claim of a half-percent sales tax when 
Superior Court Judge Gordon Burkhart ruled it illegal March 24. 
</P>
<P>
Why doesn't the County of San Diego have to return the half-percent sales tax 
it already collected to the citizens who paid it before the county can be 
allowed to appeal the case to a higher court?

INEVITABLE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary expressed by Al Ducheny and Robert Tambuzi, "Who Can Best Lead 
The Disenfranchised?" (July 23) is highly illustrative of the dilemmas faced by 
any individual or group of individuals who seek any type of change in 
marginalized communities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I don't think the authors were fair with the black and Chicano leadership 
in San Diego. These leaders know that if they fail to dance according to the 
system's tune, they will lose funds their communities need in order to keep 
from sinking into even further deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with the authors that "we cannot defer political leadership to 
providers of services, who by nature must be in good graces with the standing 
administration in order to be funded," but as long as our people continue to be 
trapped in the vicious cycle of broken and unloving homes, deficient and 
overcrowded schools, high dropout levels among our culturally confused and 
alienated youth, unemployment, unwed motherhood, welfare and crime, what other 
viable alternatives exist? 
</P>
<P>
Bureaucratization and subsequent exclusion are not only the province of 
governmental intrusion; these features are also found in community planning 
groups run by business and religious organizations. It seems to be an 
inevitable process of human interaction. 
</P>
<P>
In an imperfect world, in which effective leadership is seldom accompanied by 
sainthood, members of underrepresented ethnic groups must learn to live with 
both the limitations and advantages of seeking leadership and, if possible, try 
to speak with our own individual voices for the defense of our own interests.

REFLECTIONS: ' I'VE ALWAYS GONE BACKPACKING OR HIKING ALL THROUGH SCHOOL. I 
THINK THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS, I HAVE DIABETES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Tom Jackson, a lifelong diabetic, has had to have shots twice a day, every day 
for the past 21 years. He carries his syringe and needle with him everywhere. 
Jackson, a mechanical engineer, was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 6 years 
old. At 8, he learned how to give himself the life-saving insulin injections so 
he could spend the night at friends' houses. Jackson says diabetes has not 
slowed him down -- if anything it has made him more independent. An avid nature 
lover, the native La Jollan has sailed and backpacked all over the world. 
Recently, Jackson took a group of diabetic teen-agers from the Whittier 
Institute for Diabetes and Endocrinology on a daylong sail on his boat. He 
wanted to do something to show these children that diabetes doesn't have to 
take control of their lives. Jackson lives with his wife and 5-week-old baby 
daughter on their sailboat on Shelter Island. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke 
interviewed him, and Robert Faaborg photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
My parents gave me my injections when I was 6 years old, but I learned pretty 
early, when I was 8, how to give my own shot. I remember it was a big deal. If 
I screwed up, it just hurt more. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, it becomes like brushing your teeth. The injections aren't the 
hard part. I think the hard part is avoiding the complications. You don't want 
to overeat or undereat, and you have to make sure to eat the right stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I've always gone backpacking or hiking all through grade school and high 
school. I think the only difference is, I have diabetes. When I was 16, I 
traveled through Central America by myself. When I was 18, I worked on boats 
and just did odd jobs through college and did boat deliveries up and down 
Mexico's coast. 
</P>
<P>
I did a five-week, cross-country trip with my cousin and my wife before we were 
married, and we never once came out of the mountains. Five weeks with hardly 
seeing a trace of another human being. We packed in our food ahead of time and 
just hiked from food drop to food drop. It was a great trip. When we finally 
came out on the trails and saw people, it was quite a shock. We had been living 
pretty simply, and things seemed very complex when we got out. 
</P>
<P>
With this sailing trip last week, there were six kids from the Whittier 
Institute, and they were all diabetic. We talked about a lot of things -- 
insulin control and independence and dependence. We really developed some 
teamwork because you're fairly dependent on each other when you're sailing. 
</P>
<P>
But, more importantly, I let them know that diabetes doesn't have to be an 
anchor tied around them. They can carry the weight, and it becomes lighter and 
lighter as they stay in control and just face up to the fact they have 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
I have to admit, though, I'm lucky. It doesn't get frustrating for me. I've had 
a lot of exercise, and I haven't had any complications. I'm not saying there 
aren't people who aren't frustrated out there, because there are some serious 
complications. But it doesn't have to be such a big deal that it controls your 
life. 
</P>
<P>
I try to be an independent person. You see more that way, and you see it on 
your own. It's worth the effort. It's definitely not the path of least 
resistance, it's the path of greatest resistance a lot of times because there 
are people who think you're crazy for going out and doing things, like living 
on a houseboat. But I enjoy it. You get the opportunity to see places and meet 
people and experience different cultures that you sure wouldn't see if you just 
sat around. You might read about it, but you'll never get that rush of 
excitement from finding it out on your own. 
</P>
<P>
The world is a pretty neat place, but it's becoming smaller. I'm in a little 
bit of a rush to show Sarah (his daughter) some natural places while they're 
still natural. Just the places I've seen, I go back to them now, and there's 
concrete and signs and people. You can go to these national parks, but that's a 
wilderness with a boundary. The ocean is the one place I see that is limitless.

27 REGISTER FOR RACES IN 4 CITIES; FILING EXTENDED FOR SOME OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Voters in four South Bay cities will pick municipal officials in the Nov. 7 
general elections, and 27 candidates filed nomination papers by the deadline 
Friday. However, the filing deadline for some posts in Hermosa Beach, Rolling 
Hills Estates and Hawthorne has been extended until 5 p.m. Wednesday because 
some incumbents in those cities decided not to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The other city holding municipal elections is Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
In Hermosa Beach, Councilman Jim Rosenberger decided to bow out after one term, 
saying he had grown weary of City Hall politics and needed more time to run his 
business. Incumbents Etta Simpson and June Williams, who filed for new terms, 
will compete with at least five challengers for three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers who filed by the Friday deadline are Kathleen Midstokke, the city 
clerk; Les Barry, a journalist who writes mostly for travel publications; 
Robert Essertier, a computer software executive; lawyer Albert Wiemans and 
Christina Goddard, who listed her occupation as commercial advertising 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
Midstokke said she plans to quit her part-time, $1,000-a-month clerk's job and 
work as a paralegal. City officials recently refused to reclassify the clerk's 
position to full time at a higher salary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential Hermosa Beach candidates have until Wednesday to file for the 
council seats. 
</P>
<P>
In Rancho Palos Verdes, a lively campaign is expected for two council seats as 
a result of controversy over proposed coastal developments and tensions between 
veteran Councilman Robert E. Ryan and several other council members. Disputes 
erupted in March when Ryan's marriage to City Clerk Jo Purcell became known. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and Mayor Jacki Bacharach have filed for reelection. Others in the running 
are David F. Roche, a retired deputy assessor; businessmen Alan J. Carlan and 
Steven Kuykendall; environmentalist Kay Bara and attorneys Bob McNulty and 
Thomas E. Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
In Rolling Hills Estates, candidates for two council seats are incumbent Jacki 
McGuire, USC Prof. Ken Servis, engineer Hirsh V. Marantz and interior designer 
Susan Seamans. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nell Mirels, who was first elected to the council in 1972, decided not to 
run again. Her decision extended the filing deadline to Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a special education teacher, is seeking her first full four-year term. 
She was elected in March to fill out the term of former Councilman Jerome 
Belsky, who lost his post in a bitter recall election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6 Vie for 3 Posts 
</P>
<P>
In Hawthorne, six candidates have filed for two open council seats and the 
mayor's post. Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth has one challenger, insurance agent 
Donald Harris. Council incumbents Charles Bookhammer and David M. York will run 
against Barbara Workman, a community volunteer, and Raymon Sulser, a financial 
and land-use consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime City Treasurer Howard Wohlner is retiring, so filing for his position 
will be extended to Wednesday. His deputy, Edelma Campos, has filed for the 
post. No one filed against City Clerk Patrick E. Keller, who is seeking his 
third term. 
</P>
<P>
In the Palos Verdes Library District, three candidates filed for two open seats 
on the board that governs the three-library system. They are incumbent Janet 
Smith, consultant Frances Bolton and Alex Rennie, a retired general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The filing deadline was extended to Wednesday because incumbent Robin 
Hinchliffe did not seek reelection.

JUNKYARD RULES AIMED AT CAR THEFT BY TOW TRUCK; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE WANT TO STOP SALE OF STOLEN AUTOS FOR SCRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A rash of auto thefts in which older cars have been towed from San Fernando 
Valley streets and sold for scrap has prompted Los Angeles police to call for 
salvage-yard regulations aimed at preventing destruction of stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, seven people have been arrested in the East Valley on 
suspicion of auto theft for towing cars to salvage yards and selling them 
without the owners' consent. And authorities say at least another dozen 
tow-truck operators have engaged in the practice. 
</P>
<P>
The police proposal, scheduled to be considered by the Los Angeles Police 
Commission on Tuesday, would require junk dealers citywide to notify police 
about each car they purchase for destruction and to hold the cars intact for 
five days before crushing them. Junk dealers would also have to keep records so 
they could provide police the name of any seller of a vehicle that turned out 
to be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been happening for a long time but never on this scale," Detective Glen 
Higgins said of tow-truck operators stealing cars. Higgins is head of the 
Consolidated Effort to Combat Auto Theft, a multi-agency task force set up in 
the Valley last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tow-Truck Thieves 
</P>
<P>
Since the salvage yards pay according to weight, the tow-truck thieves have 
targeted large, older-model American autos, which can bring up to $200 each, 
Higgins said. They have also sought out dirty cars or cars that appear to have 
been in accidents since such vehicles are less likely to attract attention as 
they are hauled away, Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
People who have seen tow trucks picking up vehicles in their neighborhoods only 
suspect foul play after they hear that their neighbors' cars have been stolen, 
Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 1,500 cars reported stolen each month in the Valley, Higgins said, 10% 
to 15% are older autos in disrepair. These cars frequently belong to low-income 
families who cannot afford to lose what is sometimes their sole means of 
transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While newer stolen cars are frequently recovered, though usually with parts 
missing, these older autos rarely turn up, except as compact blocks of crushed 
metal at junkyards, Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
After four tow-truck operators were arrested in North Hollywood on Aug. 4 on 
suspicion of auto theft, police searched Valley Junk, a San Fernando scrap 
yard, and found the crushed remains of four stolen cars. 
</P>
<P>
Police said those arrested had been stealing 10 to 12 cars a day from the North 
Hollywood and Pacoima areas and selling them as scrap. 
</P>
<P>
Although police say they do not believe that junkyards deliberately collaborate 
with such thieves, they add that regulating such businesses is the best way to 
halt the destruction of stolen cars. 
</P>
<P>
But Valley junkyard operators, who say they would not crush a car they knew was 
stolen, believe that it is unfair to target them for increased regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"The police want us to do their work for them," said Mike Raspa, manager of 
Valley Junk. 
</P>
<P>
Raspa said he requires a seller to produce a "junk slip" before he buys a car 
for crushing. But junk slips, which are issued by the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles and authorize a vehicle's destruction, are easily forged, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Before a junk slip is issued, the DMV requires proof of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
But ownership papers can be easily obtained by thieves since car owners often 
keep them in the car's glove compartment, police say. 
</P>
<P>
And to make matters worse, the DMV does not contact police agencies about 
whether a vehicle is stolen before issuing a junk slip, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Larkin, weighmaster of San Fernando Crushing in Sun Valley, said her lot 
requires junk slips. But she said the lot is occasionally duped by car thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paper Work Unwelcome 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, the rules before the Police Commission would create unwelcome 
paper work for the salvage yard's staff. 
</P>
<P>
And the yard would have insufficient space to store cars intact during the 
mandatory holding period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have also proposed to the City Council that state legislation be 
requested that would allow authorities to regulate tow-truck operations outside 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Now police can conduct unannounced inspections of towing companies in Los 
Angeles but have no jurisdiction over operations based outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
The seven tow-truck operators arrested in the last month are: 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Barrocal, 30, of Sherman Oaks; Angel Simones, 28, of North Hollywood, and 
Pacoima residents Douglas Gray, 34; Jorge Cruz, 42; Teri Lynn Anderson, 32; 
Malcolm Pfeferstein, 20, and Ronald Isaacs, 51. 
</P>
<P>
Barrocal, Simones, Gray and Cruz were arrested in North Hollywood on suspicion 
of auto theft and have been released on $1,500 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has until the end of the month to file charges 
against them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary hearings are scheduled Monday in San Fernando Municipal Court for 
Anderson and Pfeferstein, each arrested in Pacoima on suspicion of grand theft 
auto and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs, charged with five felonies relating to his alleged car thefts, is 
scheduled for a preliminary hearing Aug. 21 in San Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Another tow-truck operator, Lee Schurr, 63, of Pacoima, pleaded guilty to one 
count of auto theft in San Fernando Municipal Court on May 12. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to 120 days in County Jail and four years probation. 
Authorities say Schurr and Isaacs were working together.

DON'T GET MAD, GET LITIGIOUS, KING OF SMALL CLAIMS BELIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Louis De George recalls that while growing up in a working-class Italian 
neighborhood in Jersey City, N. J., he often felt powerless to defend his 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys plumber said that in 1942, when he was 15, two police officers 
slapped him across the head and beat him on the chest with a rubber hose during 
an interrogation about why he was not in school. Complaints by his parents, he 
said, were brushed aside by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew then that I had to fight back if I wanted to get anywhere," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
De George, 62, said the experience gave him a lifetime aversion to being pushed 
around, which is why he files lawsuits in Small Claims Court when he feels 
taken advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
He has filed more than 30 such cases and credits himself with 28 victories, 
including a recent $1,500 judgment against the producers of the television show 
"People's Court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Fight' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let people get away with anything. If I feel I am right, I fight," he 
said in his New Jersey accent. "If I feel cheated, I file." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who have faced De George in court say he is an articulate speaker 
who can easily convince a judge that he has been the victim of injustice. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very believable because he believes it," said Philip Vandervort, 
associate producer of "People's Court." "He gets very righteous, and it's the 
principle for him." 
</P>
<P>
Still, his adversaries say, De George's convictions may stem from a limited 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"He is compulsive. He focuses on something and convinces himself he is right," 
Vandervort said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in his suit against the TV show, De George contended that he was 
promised $1,500 whether or not Judge Joseph Wapner ruled in his favor. De 
George zeroed in on a message left on his answering machine by a show 
researcher who "guaranteed" a $1,500 payment. But Vandervort said that in 
subsequent contacts with De George, show staffers explained that the payment 
was only guaranteed if the plaintiff wins the case. 
</P>
<P>
De George lost on the show; he had contended that his apartment manager's son 
broke the rear-view mirror on his truck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's selective hearing," Vandervort said. "I'm sure he could pass a polygraph 
test." 
</P>
<P>
De George's former electrologist said she suspects that he deliberately 
misrepresents facts to get money and free services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Good Actor' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything good to say about him except he is a very good actor," 
said Ginger Graham, whom De George consulted to have hair removed from between 
his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
De George sued Graham when the hair grew back after several treatments. He said 
that electrolysis had been advertised as eliminating hair permanently, and he 
won $72 in court. 
</P>
<P>
But Graham said that it often takes repeated treatments before hair stops 
growing back and that the brochure De George showed in court as falsely 
advertising permanent hair removal was for electrolysis in general, not for her 
salon. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets his kicks by getting things for free," she said. "He anticipated the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
De George denies that he has abused the Small Claims Court system. He said he 
files cases only when he has been "cheated, conned or tricked." 
</P>
<P>
And in many cases, he said, he seeks less than $100 -- money rightfully owed 
him by people who fail to provide promised services. He said he seeks punitive 
damages only if he feels that people have deliberately deceived him for profit. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't fight, people will just walk all over you," De George said. 
</P>
<P>
De George's victories include a $1,500 judgment against his former landlord, 
who a judge ruled had charged too much rent over four years; a $50 award from a 
doctor who had kept him waiting for nearly two hours, and awards totaling 
$2,692 from five car repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
He also has won cases against a dry cleaner who lost his suit; the owner of a 
dump truck, from which a stone fell and cracked his windshield, and the 
American owner of a hotel in Mexico City, which was advertised as "first-class" 
but actually had a standard rating. 
</P>
<P>
In his first suit -- filed in 1957 in Jersey City after he read a newspaper 
article about Small Claims Court -- he won $300 from a tailor who claimed to 
custom make shirts. De George said he had paid $300 for 10 shirts, but when he 
brought the garments home, he realized that they were mass-produced and altered 
to fit him. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a truck driver, De George, a high school dropout, said he sees 
himself as a little guy protecting his rights. If he had not been forced to 
take a full-time job at 16 to help support his three younger brothers, he said, 
he would have been a defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contacted Official 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cathcart, consultant to the state Senate Committee on Insurance Claims and 
Corporations, met De George several years ago when the man called to complain 
about the law requiring all drivers to have auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he was a bit of a pain, but there was certainly enough of a 
rationality that I was obligated to talk to him. I couldn't dismiss him because 
he had points that were correct," Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Cathcart, who said he admires De George's tenacity and willingness to 
stand up for his rights, brought him to Sacramento to testify before the 
committee during hearings about insurance companies that were not complying 
with newly enacted Proposition 103, the insurance rate rollback initiative. An 
insurance company had canceled De George's policy in violation of the new law, 
Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real need for these people in our society," Cathcart said. "If we 
don't have people like that, who is going to keep us honest?" 
</P>
<P>
De George doesn't always win his cases. In two he has lost, he failed to get a 
security deposit back from a landlord, and he failed to win damages against a 
car mechanic who, he said, had deliberately tampered with his carburetor so 
that he would order more car repairs. In the first case, he said, he did not 
have the documents to prove his case, and in the second, he lacked the 
technical background to explain his contention. 
</P>
<P>
Still, De George attributes his generally winning ways to lessons he learned by 
reading "My Life in the Mafia," the autobiography of Vincent Teresa, a New 
England organized crime figure. 
</P>
<P>
De George, the grandson of immigrants from Sicily, said he admires the Mafia 
because "they made something out of nothing. They were all born with holes in 
their pants and in their shoes, and they amounted to something."

If only bridges could talk . . . 
</P>
<P>
Since 1912, when Torrance was founded by Pasadena businessman Jared Sidney 
Torrance, the city has gone from a sleepy town of oil derricks and family farms 
to a major commercial and industrial center. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, standing strong and majestic over Torrance Boulevard near 
212th Street, has been the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
When it was built in 1912, the cement and steel structure carried the Pacific 
Electric Railroad line over a two-lane road way that would later become one of 
the city's busiest traffic arteries. 
</P>
<P>
This week city officials announced that the ivy-covered bridge has been named 
to the National Register of Historic Places. The listing gives the bridge a 
certain cachet, earns it a plaque and protects it from being demolished if any 
project threatening it is federally financed. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge was designed by architect Irving Gill, who 
also designed the Woman's Club in La Jolla, the Bishop School for Girls and the 
Museum of Man in Balboa Park. The bridge served the downtown Torrance depot and 
made it possible for workmen in Torrance factories to travel by rail to and 
from their homes in Gardena, Redondo Beach and even Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers built the town, laid the streets and the street lights," said 
Grace Elgin, the coordinator for the Torrance Historic Society Museum. "It's 
definitely a part of the history of Torrance." 
</P>

<P>
You know the Northrop Corp. It's the giant defense contractor that gave the 
world the Stealth bomber, that half-billion dollar flying wing that is supposed 
to be invisible to enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
The folks at Northrop are proud of the Stealth and all the other cutting-edge 
technology they have produced during the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop people see themselves as pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
But until last week, the spot where all the pioneering began was almost as 
invisible as the Stealth -- covered over by a parking lot for the giant 
Hawthorne Plaza shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop and the city of Hawthorne corrected that on Thursday with the 
dedication of a plaque at the spot where the aerospace giant was born. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth led the ceremony under a eucalyptus tree in the 
parking lot, adjacent to Hawthorne Boulevard. The mayor unveiled a historical 
marker that reads, in part: "At this site on August 10, 1939, John K. Northrop 
and six engineering associates set up the first Northrop corporate office at 
Hotel Hawthorne. From this small beginning the company grew to be a leader in 
the aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth also had a gift for Northrop President Kent Kresa. "I present you a 
key to the city," Ainsworth said, "which is really a key to our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Northrop executives and city employees applauded heartily. 
</P>
<P>
A few old-timers in the crowd remember firsthand the significance of the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Company founder Jack Northrop had left Douglas Aircraft in 1938 to form his own 
firm that he said would concentrate on research and development, rather than 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling "Northrop Group" took up quarters in the hotel, long since 
replaced with a parking lot, while awaiting completion of the company's first 
plant on a nearby 72-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
At the dedication, there were pictures of the old hotel, a nondescript 
two-story building on a quiet street. Survivors of those early days remember 
that the hotel was "a former local 'house of pleasure' painted a shameless 
yellow," according to a company history. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's ceremony, retired engineer Fran Gibian, 78, recalled the early 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit was always great with Jack Northrop around," Gibian said. 
"Sometimes he would come to speak to us at lunch and everyone would be there, 
even the guys who usually went out (to lunch) or just grabbed a candy bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Or he would walk into the shop, just to talk to everyone. He was a very good 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Gibian fondly recalled his identification badge number -- 36. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop now counts 11,000 employees in Hawthorne and 44,600 worldwide. James 
Rainey

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO DIED IN CUSTODY IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aman who died in police custody after a violent rampage through a Sylmar 
neighborhood was identified Saturday as James Michael Opp, 33, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Stephen Fisk said Friday that the man, who 
witnesses said was "frothing at the mouth" and screaming incoherently, died 
Thursday of what appeared to be drug-related causes. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsy results should be available this week, but results of toxicological 
tests to determine if drugs were involved will not be ready for a month or two, 
said David Campbell, a supervising investigator with the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The man died about 2 p.m. in the back seat of a police car that was taking him 
to the Van Nuys Jail infirmary for treatment, Fisk said. He was arrested in the 
15500 block of Bledsoe Street after he allegedly attacked an elderly couple who 
were getting into their car, authorities said. Neighbors said he appeared to be 
attacking a mailbox and stumbling through bushes, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell confirmed a published report that identified the man as Opp.

PLACENTIA -- EVER THE HOTBED OF SPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The day Michael Chang won this summer's French Open tennis tournament, my 
father turned 75. 
</P>
<P>
This unremarkable coincidence escaped me for about the time it takes the 
cat-footed Chang to reach a drop volley. You see, I always thought Dad was the 
best tennis player in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Of course 20 years ago, when I was weaned on the cracked concrete courts at 
Chang's Valencia High School, there was not much competition. Though stricken 
with tendinitis in the elbow, often referred to as tennis elbow, Dad still had 
a wicked serve and deft skills at the base line. Sure, his best days from the 
University of Chicago were behind him, but in Placentia he was as good as any 
who played on the public courts. 
</P>
<P>
As good as any whom we saw because in the mid-'60s, tennis was about as popular 
in Placentia as ice skating. 
</P>
<P>
Dad changed that in a small way. He allowed us minions -- suburban urchins all 
-- to follow him to the courts and try our luck at a few swipes at the fuzzy 
balls. Most of us were not any good, but heck, we were still in junior high 
school. Eventually, this cadre formed part of the El Dorado High School tennis 
team, which had the distinction of being the school's first varsity team sport 
to win a league championship and compete in the Southern Section playoffs. When 
the team came up against San Marino High in the quarterfinals, its luck ended 
against a team composed of players from private clubs. 
</P>
<P>
We had a club player attending our school, but she was not allowed to compete 
on a boys' team. Still, Placentians paid homage to Lori Sherbeck back then as 
if she were a French Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
Much ado was made over an article in the now-defunct Placentia Courier one day, 
heralding Sherbeck as the city's best tennis player. Perhaps she had earned the 
status as one of the country's highest-ranked junior players. But one of my 
friends on the high school team proclaimed: "She's not the best in the city. 
Neither is your dad. I am." 
</P>
<P>
The remark left me in a funk, as the crumbling of any deity would, but when 
recounting the conversation to Dad, he just laughed, the kind of knowing spirit 
that quickly dispelled gloom. 
</P>
<P>
But we'll never know who was the best. Dad did not bother to seriously play us, 
and Lori Sherbeck was confined to Girls Athletic Assn. activity, as well as 
U.S. Tennis Assn. junior tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
But I haven't changed my posture. I told my friend then and reiterate now: If 
Lori had played on the boys' team she would have been the No. 1 player. A 
couple of years later, her younger brothers, David and Eric, earned that 
distinction during their court careers. 
</P>
<P>
Today much is being made of Placentia's prowess as a veritable sports mill 
because of two teens who have that special charismatic quality. El Dorado's 
Janet Evans had a tremendous performance in swimming competition at the 1988 
Summer Olympics, and Chang's never-say-die perseverance on the red clay of 
Roland Garros and at Wimbledon has been an inspiration to anyone down two sets 
to love and ready to throw in the racket. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning tract-home community of 37,000 has been injected with new-found 
enthusiasm by embracing the glory of the international successes. 
</P>
<P>
But tracking the city's history recalls some achievements that in their time 
were considered as monumental as Evans' and Chang's. Dan Kenney, who recently 
returned to Placentia with a wife and daughter after a 15-year hiatus, was 
recalling the exploits of Guy Antley, who in the early 1970s was considered one 
of the world's best water polo goalies. 
</P>
<P>
When the P in Placentia stood for pleasant, when the sweet aroma of orange 
blossoms permeated the air, when Palm Avenue was the only road to the outside, 
we revered anyone who was so athletically inclined. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia would do well to remember Antley; the DeWeeses, Bob and Jim, who both 
briefly played in the National Basketball Assn.; Ronny Moors, Valencia's 
sky-bound pole vaulter, and too many other young heroes over the years to 
recount here. 
</P>
<P>
It's bizarre that John Henry Cyrus III, Valencia's tennis coach, is quoted in 
Orange County newspapers adding his insight to Chang's accomplishments. Perhaps 
John is too humble to let reporters in on the secret. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when he was Placentia's best-known athlete as the star of the 
Valencia Tigers football team. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the world just didn't know it. 
</P>
<P>
But I knew it, just as I knew my Dad reigned on the concrete courts.

MOBIL'S PLANS FOR PICNIC AT REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People worry needlessly. Take those who are concerned about a possible killer 
cloud of hydrogen fluoride from the Mobil Oil refinery. Mobil officials have 
the problem well in hand. They're treating it with hot dogs and jugglers! (The 
Times, Aug. 10) 
</P>
<P>
Of course, their big picnic has nothing to do with the March initiative banning 
their use of hydrofluoric acid at their plant. Their spokesman has said so. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, those who favor the initiative do so because they realize that an 
accident causing a major release of hydrogen fluoride can happen with the very 
best management. The probability of an accident only jumps up with a management 
which substitutes public relations campaigns for real safety. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Mobil! $200,000 for public relations, $88,000 for a tame experts' 
report and how much more for damages after a disaster? 
</P>
<P>
Dump your hydrofluoric acid process. You don't need it and neither do we. It 
will be cheaper in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Have you figured the cost of mustard for those hot dogs?

COSTA MESA ALIEN VOTE INVITES DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week the Costa Mesa City Council, in an action whose petty meanness was 
matched only by its impracticality, voted 3 to 2 to halt funding for various 
civic and social service groups that serve illegal aliens. Only health-care 
providers were exempted. 
</P>
<P>
Whether their zeal to punish the least fortunate and most vulnerable among us 
is guided by an amoral allegiance to the god of cost accounting or simple 
indifference to the suffering of others, Costa Mesa has set a dangerous 
precedent for other cities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect will be to make it more difficult for those charitable and civic 
organizations that represent part of what President Bush has called a thousand 
points of light to do their wonderful work. 
</P>
<P>
These local Scrooges have threatened the funding of groups as diverse and 
useful as the Boys and Girls Club, the South Orange County YMCA, the Feedback 
Foundation and Opera Pacific, all of which get some city assistance because 
they help people in need, some of whom may be here illegally. Children and 
adults will now be denied access to food, shelter, educational experiences or a 
basketball court because their papers are not in order. 
</P>
<P>
This is the City Council that has given police the power to arrest dayworkers 
who appear to be asking for a job on the street, even though they may not have 
been seen actually doing so, and that terminated the lease of Share Our Selves 
(SOS), a volunteer agency providing food, clothing and care for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are social and economic costs associated with the presence of 
illegal aliens in Orange County. But the Costa Mesa action is typical of an 
approach that exacerbates rather than solves the problem. It is an approach 
that will succeed only in raising racial and cultural tensions and burdening 
those organizations that are, day to day, attempting to help all the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the city disbursed $266,000 in federal Community Development Block 
Grant funds and general revenue sharing money to 30 such organizations. The 
federal government does not require that the legal status of recipients be 
proven, although it gives cities wide discretion in how the money is used. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons, grounded in both practical and moral considerations, 
why Costa Mesa's policy is unwise. 
</P>
<P>
First, this move by the council endangers future federal assistance to the 
city, according to a spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. HUD has referred the matter to its legal department to see if the 
Costa Mesa policy violates federal anti-discrimination rules. 
</P>
<P>
Second, as the council's policy statement notes, Congress has enacted a law 
that establishes regulations with respect to immigration and people who enter 
the country illegally. That is where enforcement of immigration policy resides 
-- with the federal government, specifically the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy in effect makes any organization receiving city money an arm of 
the INS. It includes groups as diverse as South Coast Repertory, which will 
receive $29,000 from the city in fiscal 1989-'90, and Sunshine Community 
Pre-School, a $1,200 grantee. Both seem unlikely agents of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the city is opening itself up to legal action from civil liberties 
organizations and any other group with an interest in the action. In fact, 
legal action has already been threatened. This is both ironic and 
self-defeating, particularly in view of Mayor Peter F. Buffa's plaint that the 
city's position on this issue is untenable because Costa Mesa is being 
whipsawed between grant recipients and the possibility of resident suits over 
improper use of city funds. According to the city attorney's office, no such 
suits are pending now. 
</P>
<P>
The policy is also virtually impossible for the city to enforce. Even Mayor 
Buffa, who voted with the majority, concedes that. A procedural section that 
would have given the city access to the records of those accepting funds as a 
condition of receiving them was stricken. 
</P>
<P>
That dumps the responsibility for enforcement back into the laps of fund 
recipients, most of whom seem dubious candidates for the job. And the city is 
no help here, for the policy provides no steps or outline as to how to ensure 
illegals are not among those being assisted. Lack of documents proving legal 
residence does not preclude it. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth consideration is how this decision will affect the primary mission of 
the organizations involved if they assume the burden of enforcement. For the 
agencies involved to divert funds to checking clients means less money spent 
where it is more properly needed. The council has, in effect, said that it must 
forgo receiving revenues or expend a portion of them in a dubious battle. 
</P>
<P>
The organizations in question provide services to residents. But that includes 
seniors, has included aerospace workers, and no doubt will include other 
"desirables" who are for one reason or another in tight financial straits. A de 
facto denial of funds because a few clients are in the country illegally 
punishes those who are residents. It is a classic case of throwing out the baby 
with the bath water. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the council invites racial discrimination and bullying. A vast 
proportion of California's illegal immigrants are Mexican. Will all Asians who 
seek shelter be asked for documentation of legal residence? Will blacks whose 
children need medical care need a green card? Will Caucasians with daughters 
who want to join the Newport Mesa Girls Club be forced to prove nationality? 
Don't bet the ranch. Sad as it is to weigh, there will be those tempted to 
discriminate against any Latino-looking clients either in self-defense or 
because official city guidance now invites them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the council may enact any course it deems fitting. But at a time 
when so many people are in need, even in affluent Orange County, people of good 
will and generosity should be able to unite and devise sensible solutions. This 
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa has not set a flattering example. Other cities with real or imagined 
problems of illegal immigrants may wait to see how this matter resolves itself 
or yield to baser instincts and erect similar barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Buffa and Councilmen Ed Glasgow and Orville Amburgey, the last of whom 
fathered this step, now have an opportunity to cast another vote. They, along 
with their opposition, Councilwomen Sandra L. Genis and Mary Hornbuckle, should 
rescind this foolishness. It is a policy that recognizes neither right nor 
reality.

CHILD'S RIGHTS NEED RESPECT TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY STARK, Amy Stark is a clinical psychologist in Tustin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The No. 1 cause of death in children under the age of 1 is child abuse. In our 
media-saturated society, publicized cases of abuse tend to cloud the reality of 
the problem. Grim details and horrific tales of a deranged abuser give the 
image that the problem is only prevalent where there is a severely disturbed 
parent, such as the Orange County woman who ran over her baby with the car and 
pleaded postpartum depression as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the individual who is not overtly aggressive? Do we stop to 
consider the thousands of people that lead "normal" lives and beat their 
children as a form of punishment or a release of their own frustrations? We 
cannot turn our backs and say, "Well, I don't abuse children." Child abuse is 
not an individual's problem. It is society's problem. We need to work together 
to give children a life free of emotional and physical abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Child abuse appears in two general forms: physical abuse and emotional abuse. 
Physical abuse can and does consist of slapping, punching, biting, burning, 
scratching and sexual molestation. This mistreatment can both maim and kill a 
child. Emotional abuse, which is the most difficult to detect, is a subtle, 
insidious destruction of a child's self-esteem and psychological sense of self. 
This form of abuse can be the most dangerous to a child's psyche. A child that 
is constantly intimidated, belittled and neglected is going to have trouble 
interacting with peers, authority figures and society in general. An abused 
child has severe difficulty growing emotionally; this often leads to 
psychological problems later in life. 
</P>
<P>
Most abused children will not report their own suffering, fearing further abuse 
from their persecutor. Unexplained bruises, welts and burns, children who are 
consistently uncared for and hungry, abrupt changes in behavior and prolonged 
listlessness are all possible signs of child abuse and should be questioned. If 
abuse is reasonably suspected, a national referral service is readily available 
at (800) 4-A-CHILD. 
</P>
<P>
In order for a child to be freed from this suffering, the abuse must be 
reported. However, once the report is made, the situation can sometimes go from 
bad to worse. Abused children tend to develop a love-hate relationship with the 
abuser. Often an abused child will be removed from the home screaming for the 
same person that was abusing him or her, since the child prefers "hell" to the 
unknown. A child may also protect the abuser and deny the abuse in an attempt 
to win love or out of fear of the wrath that may result in admitting to the 
suffering. The child's hesitation to report the details is further complicated 
by the fact that the legal system is usually intent on reuniting a family. 
</P>
<P>
As a therapist, I cannot express how painful it is to help children protect 
themselves when the law cannot. By focusing intently on a parent's rights, the 
law often returns abused children to the parents, resulting in further abuse, 
and sometimes death. A child's rights must be considered to be equally 
important, if not more important, as a parent's, if only for the fact that a 
child is defenseless against an adult. A recent case in Orange County shows the 
court's focus on parental rights and family reunification. 
</P>
<P>
A father had been abusing his 7-year-old daughter through repeated physical 
beatings, verbal harassment and sexual molestation. Once the abuse was reported 
and proven, the law intervened to separate the father and the child. 
</P>
<P>
After the separation, the courts wanted to give the father another chance -- 
even though there had been documented evidence of verbal, physical and sexual 
abuse. The father was allowed unsupervised, off-grounds visitation rights and 
the abuse continued. When it was finally realized that abuse was still 
occurring, the father was restricted to supervised visitations. This child 
suffered needless pain and psychological damage -- that may be irreversible -- 
in order to preserve the parent's rights. But what about the child's rights? 
Our legal system is so intent on reunification that it will be recommended even 
when it is not in the child's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
Why should a child's rights take a back seat to the parents'? Child-abuse 
legislation needs a change of focus. Parents should not always have the 
ultimate right, and reunification is not always the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that once a family is reunited, child abuse usually occurs 
again. Children deserve the legal right not to be abused. 
</P>
<P>
Our courts need to set some precedence regarding children's rights. We need to 
offer alternatives and counseling to abusive parents, as well as the children. 
It must also be realized that depression and alcoholism do not relieve parents 
of their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
We must all work with the legal system by reporting child abuse and instituting 
laws that protect children before another child is afflicted.

CONGRESSMAN'S AIRPORT SITE STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard was 50% right when he opposed two county airport sites 
recommended for consideration by the airport site coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a member of the airport site coalition committee, I too feel that 
the Potrero Los Pinos site would be an ecological disaster. The Cleveland 
National Forest should be protected! On the other hand, the south Camp 
Pendleton site should be considered the top choice since it is conveniently 
located to serve 40 million passengers annually -- with rail and freeway access 
already in place -- and meets all of the Federal Aviation Administration 
criteria for an international airport. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Packard spoke out just like the proverbial politician, considering only 
the economics and job loss in the closing of Norton Air Force Base. He should 
be more aware that members of the airport site coalition meet monthly, 
averaging over 120 members present, studying and evaluating over 30 potential 
sites in the past 14 months! 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps has been very cooperative in its deliberations and favors the 
southern site rather than the Las Pulgas location. They too realize that it 
will take 10 years to build when it will be urgently needed to relieve the 
overburden now building up at L.A. International and John Wayne airports.

LYON'S DEALING WITH HUD ON RANCH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maj. Gen. William Lyon is a man of immense integrity. His business savvy and 
ability to negotiate are second to none. He certainly does not need to seek 
unfair advantage in his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
As one who has worked with him on community and political projects, I can 
assure you he is unwilling to bend his own standards for short-term gain. He 
does not compromise his integrity to win. Your articles failed to emphasize the 
premium value of the William Lyon Co.'s all-cash offer over a leveraged deal. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it is critical that the people of Orange County know the huge 
contribution that Gen. and Mrs. Lyon have made not only to the political 
process and our national security but to opportunities for children, to the 
arts, to health, to education, to law enforcement and to a myriad of other 
activities that make our county so great. It could be said that Bill Lyon has 
positively impacted and made a difference in the life of each and every Orange 
Countian. 
</P>
<P>
When this current matter is cleared up, I hope you will put that story on the 
front page.

DEVELOPMENT IN THE FOOTHILL-TRABUCO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small number of Orange County developers will reap fortunes if tentative 
plans are approved favoring intensive development (destruction?) of the Trabuco 
Canyon and Cook's Corner areas. The question is: at whose expense? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the 500 or so residents of Trabuco Canyon will pay dearly as they see 
their quality of life deteriorate around them. But so will the countless 
residents of neighboring areas who regularly or even occasionally take that 
slow drive beneath the living canopy of oak trees that line Live Oak Canyon 
Road. It's hard to get a few minutes of natural serenity like that in Orange 
County today. In fact, it's difficult to even find a rural area anymore in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Trabuco Canyon area provides a rural retreat for the high density 
communities of Rancho Santa Margarita, El Toro, Mission Viejo, Portola Hills 
and others. Don't destroy one of our last remaining rural retreats just so a 
few more developers can make another quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will still make money enough on their land holdings if 
development under the Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan now being considered by 
the Board of Supervisors is limited to a few homes on large parcels. And most 
important, the rest of us won't have to sacrifice more quality of life for the 
profit of a few.

A COMMENT ON DORNAN'S COMMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a rare occasion that I am in agreement with Rep. Robert K. Dornan. His 
commentary (July 30), however, is something that all open-minded citizens 
should support. 
</P>
<P>
Our country is strong because of its mixture of heritages and its "pioneer 
spirit." We should remain a symbol for the world to follow even though we 
can't, won't or shouldn't try to be the world's policeman.

TOP TWO SEEDED PLAYERS BEATEN IN BOYS' 12 SEMIFINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
Justin Gimelstob figured that sooner or later, it would end. It just had to. 
</P>
<P>
He had taken a 5-0 lead in the first set against top-seeded Blake McMeans in 
the semifinals of the Boys' 12 U.S. Tennis Assn. National Championships at 
Morely Field. But then Gimelstob helplessly watched as McMeans rocketed shots 
by him to pull within 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
"He just started hitting shots I couldn't believe," said Gimelstob, who is 
seeded third. "He couldn't keep it up like that. Nobody can keep it up like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
McMeans' torrid comeback finally fizzled, and Gimelstob went on to win, 6-4, 
6-1, to reach today's 11:30 a.m. final against No. 4 Matthew Wright. Wright 
defeated No. 2 Ryan Wolters, 6-4, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob, from Great Falls, N.J., knocked off McMeans by being patient and 
smart. McMeans, a bigger player from Knoxville, Tenn., relied on his power 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob effectively moved McMeans around the court, not letting him get into 
a groove where he could comfortably blast the ball. The strategy worked until 
McMeans hit his stride after trailing, 5-0. McMeans allowed Gimelstob just two 
points in the next three games and led 40-15 in the fourth before closing it 
out to trail, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob looked tentative during McMeans' run but then regrouped and again 
began mixing his shots and moving McMeans around the court to close out the 
set, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob had little trouble in the second set, breaking McMeans four times and 
not allowing him a point until the third game. McMeans broke to trail, 3-1, and 
looked as if he was going to go on another tear. But Gimelstob held him off by 
winning four consecutive points after behind down 15-love in the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
"At 3-1 he started doing it again," Gimelstob said. "I thought 'I don't want 
this to happen again.' 
</P>
<P>
"You just hope it ends before you shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob will see a familiar face in today's finals. Wright defeated him in 
the consolation rounds at last year's tournament when both were 11. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who is from Wichita, Kan., has yet to lose a set of singles in the 
tournament. He had not lost more than four games in a match before the 
semifinals, although he came close to going three sets against Wolters, who is 
from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Wright held on to win the first set, 6-4, after taking a 5-1 lead, then rallied 
from 3-4 to win the second set on a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was receiving for match point at 6-5 but missed an easy overhead. 
Wolters did not give up a point on his serve in the 12th game and pulled even 
at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was total control of the tiebreaker, winning the first four points and 
coasting to a 7-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous (going into the tiebreaker)," Wright said. "I thought to myself 
'how bad do I really want it?' 
</P>
<P>
"I usually play well in tiebreakers, that's probably the best part of my game 
because I want it so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob and Wright will be doing double duty today; both reached the doubles 
final. Gimelstob and Jan Michael Gambill of Spokane, Wash., seeded third, will 
play No. 1 Wright and McMeans an hour after the singles final.

AZTECS LEARN LUGINBILL WON'T MAKE IT EASY

San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill labeled Saturday's first full-team football 
workouts a success. 
</P>
<P>
The players? Well, most of them could only nod in affirmation until they caught 
their breaths. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was hot and the atmosphere intense, and when the second practice 
finally ended around 5:45 p.m., the players were downright exhausted. Senior 
receiver Tony Nettles and freshman receiver Jake Nyberg had to be taken out of 
drills and treated for dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard," said Pio Sagapolutele, a junior defensive tackle. "A lot harder 
than when I was a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say the players are not in good shape -- quite the opposite, 
Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
"With a few exceptions, everybody reported in excellent condition," he said. "I 
am very pleased with the condition of this football team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sagapolutele: "I think everybody's in pretty good shape. It will just take 
a couple of days to get used to practicing again. That's not a negative 
comment. It's tough. But we all know we're going to get something out of it. We 
just have to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Three more players left the team Saturday, joining backup quarterback Brad 
Platt. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill had given Platt, a fifth-year senior, until Saturday's morning 
practice to change his mind about not returning. Platt, who said he was not 
happy playing football anymore, was absent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Luginbill, "He didn't show up, and that was the answer. He's made his 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
The other three who have left are Scott Kilgore, Eric Williams and Tom 
Siufanua. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgore, a redshirt freshman from San Jose, looked good during spring drills 
and was expected to contest for playing time at linebacker. He told Luginbill 
he lacked the desire to continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said Williams, an incoming freshman defensive back, "must have felt 
he was in over his head." 
</P>
<P>
Siufanua, an incoming freshman defensive lineman, left because of an illness in 
the family, Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
On the field but not doing much practicing Saturday was Patrick Rowe. The 
junior receiver said he hurt his knee during Friday's agility tests. 
</P>
<P>
While attrition was a major topic of conversation, nutrition was another. 
</P>
<P>
New, improved eating arrangements for the team might have made up at least a 
little for the difficult practices. In the past, the players always ate in the 
dining commons across campus during fall drills. This season, they are being 
catered to outdoors at the football operations center.

NOMADS DEFEAT SAN FRANCISCO FOR WSL TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
On a night when nothing seemed to go right offensively for the San Diego 
Nomads, it was fitting that they scored the game's lone goal because of an 
errant pass that everyone overran. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps beggars can't be choosers, but they can be champions. The game-winner, 
headed just just inside the unguarded left post by Paul Wright four minutes 
into the second half, was only the third shot the Nomads had managed all 
evening. But it not only gave them a 1-0 victory over the San Francisco Bay 
Blackhawks; it clinched their second Western Soccer League championship in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The winning play began inconspicuously. The ball was played from Jerome Watson 
in front of the penalty area to Thien Nguyen on the right wing. But it never 
really got to Nguyen, not at first, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was unable to meet the pass as he ran in from the sideline with two 
defenders on his back. After the ball slipped past and rolled toward the 
corner, Nguyen regrouped, shook the defenders and got to it just before it went 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the defender had it," said Nguyen, whose seven regular-season 
assists were a league record. "But right when I ran past the defender, I looked 
up and saw Paul in the middle, so I just went for Paul." 
</P>
<P>
All alone in the corner, Nguyen sent a perfect cross into the middle, where 
Wright stood unmarked. A simple deflection off his head was all it took. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, there had been nothing simple about getting past the Blackhawk 
defense. In all, the Nomads managed just five shots to the Blackhawks' 16. 
</P>
<P>
"The stats were all in our favor," said Dean Wurzberger, Blackhawk coach. "But 
that's soccer. . . . We should have decided it in the first 20 minutes of 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Wurzberger got no argument from the Nomads. San Francisco Bay had its chances. 
Townsend Qin, a five-year Chinese National team player from Shanghai who 
answered a want-ad for players last winter, was responsible for creating the 
Blackhawks' best opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Some 33 minutes into the game, Qin tackled the ball away from Nomad defender 
Tommy Reasoner. He dribbled into the penalty area, drew sweeper Arturo Velazco 
to him and dished off to wide-open Steve Corpening some 20 yards in front of 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Corpening's shot whistled by onrushing Anton Nistle, the Nomad goalie, and 
appeared headed for the net. 
</P>
<P>
But it banked off the far right post. 
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes later, the Blackhawk forwards were challenging Nistle once 
again. This time Qin sent a cross in front of the goal from the right sideline, 
meeting David Palic just five feet off the line. 
</P>
<P>
Palic didn't even have to beat Nistle this time -- the goalie was out of 
position having missed at punching the cross wide. But this time, the crossbar 
provided the defense.

You don't need a decorating authority to tell you that a room with whitewashed 
walls, unpolished terra-cotta floors, blue-and-white tiles and an antique 
walnut armoire is a country-French-style room. 
</P>
<P>
This rustic, traditional style is one of the most popular looks currently. 
Consequently, you'll find many reproductions in the marketplace to help you 
achieve it, says Pierre Moulin, co-author of "Pierre Deux's French Country." 
</P>
<P>
A principal of Pierre Deux, the New York antiques firm that helped popularize 
the style, Moulin says the French-country look is more an overall feeling than 
any single specific group of furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says, some of these elements in antiques or reproductions help to 
create a French-country room: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An armoire -- often as tall as 10 feet -- was often part of a bride's dowry 
and was passed down from one generation to another. Today, armoires are used to 
store a great variety of belongings, such as clothing, linens, home 
entertainment equipment, dinnerware and bar ware. Armoires look great in 
virtually any room, especially the living area, dining room and bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
French armoires are usually walnut or cherry and often feature carvings of 
flowers, wheat or vine leaves. Some of the prettiest armoires, however, have 
painted finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dining chairs in country-French rooms are rustic and simple. Rush seats are 
typical, but cane and ladder backs are also used. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Appropriate French-country beds include canopy beds, beds with panel 
headboards and day beds. A white-mesh, draped-metal framed bed with a canopy 
frame that comes to a center point is a romantic treatment. Most country 
bedrooms were quite simple, with a minimum of possessions and accessories on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Country-French fabrics emphasize natural fibers. Good choices include 
vividly colored Provencal prints, plaids and tapestries, and toile de Jouy 
scenes in white with black, red, green or blue can be used both as upholstery 
and to line walls. 
</P>
<P>
If you're stuck for a color scheme or fabric choice, look at the provincial 
paintings of Cezanne and Van Gogh to get some ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some additional decorating suggestions from Michael Delgaudio, fashion 
director of Henredon Furniture: 
</P>
<P>
Paint the walls white. A stucco finish is ideal because it provides a rustic 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Terra-cotta tile, bare wood planking or sisal matting are all appropriate 
choices for floors. If you like the look of tile, but don't want to install it, 
try painting the floor with a blue and white trompe l'oeil tile pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange furniture symmetrically and use pairs of furniture and accessories to 
create a strong feeling of balance. For example, place the same model of 
console table or chairs at either side of a door or sofa. Place two 
candlesticks on a mantel. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasize accessories such as pewter, glazed and unglazed ceramic pieces, 
copper pots, straw baskets, dried flowers. For fresh flowers, favor potted 
geraniums and bunches of daisies, and hang pictures a little higher than 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange the interior of armoires attractively so you can leave them open. Line 
them with French fabric, as housewives did in Provence. Keep window treatments 
simple; lace panels are appropriate.

COUNTY HOPES TO FINISH WORK ON NEW COURTHOUSE WITHIN SEVERAL WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DOWNEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers moved about last week putting the finishing touches on a new municipal 
courthouse -- seven months late. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the courthouse has been delayed primarily because some equipment 
had to be improved to make the building's detention cells more secure, said R. 
E. Abbott, the county's senior deputy director of construction and real 
property services. Several fire doors also needed to be replaced and other 
safety features improved. 
</P>
<P>
The $18.8-million, four-story building should be completed within budget in the 
next several weeks, Abbott said. It was initially scheduled for completion last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Municipal Court officials are anxious to move out of separate buildings 
they occupy near City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that it's going to open soon," Presiding Judge Donald L. Wilson 
said. "I wish it would open tomorrow. It's a vast improvement over the worn-out 
building we're using." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved in December, 1986 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the courthouse project in 
December, 1986. The 101,000-square-foot courthouse is next to the county 
library on the southeast corner of Imperial Highway and Old River School Road. 
It will serve the Downey Municipal Court District, which includes Downey, 
Norwalk and La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
The new building will replace a courthouse on 3rd Street that is too small to 
house all the court facilities. The old courthouse was built in 1951 and later 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, the public defender's office, the civil and 
small claims office and the jurors' assembly room occupy rented space in 
buildings near the old courthouse. Those offices will be consolidated in the 
new courthouse, which includes seven courtrooms and two hearing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott said officials decided to change an electronic system that controls 
double doors to the courthouse's detention cells after a review by a Sheriff's 
Department expert. The cells will be used by prisoners waiting for hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to a little better model because there was some concern on the part of 
our security staff that it might not be secure enough," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
There were about a dozen instances where fire doors, ceilings and smoke 
barriers needed to be improved to meet safety standards. County and city fire 
officials discovered the deficiencies during recent inspections, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
A final inspection is scheduled before the building is occupied, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attention to Fire Protection 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we almost always have problems with on these types of 
facilities is getting the fire protection system right," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey court officials say they are happy with the design and furnishings of 
the new courthouse now that several relatively minor changes have been made. 
</P>
<P>
During the planning phase, the judges requested that a doorway from a public 
corridor into their library be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a security device," Wilson said. "We don't want a doorway open to public 
access to the back of the courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
The judges also requested that small windows be added to the courtroom doors to 
enhance security. Also, a room had to be enlarged to accommodate computer 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was a carpeting problem. 
</P>
<P>
There was supposed to be blue carpeting in the judges' library and green 
carpeting in an employees' lounge, court clerk Elaine E. Osborne said. But 
instead, workers laid the same mauve carpeting that is in the new courtrooms. 
The library and the lounge have been recarpeted, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a change of pace when you take an employee from a work atmosphere 
into a lounge," Osborne said. "They just had all this mauve carpeting and they 
kept laying it down."

AS OLD INDUSTRIES EBB, SAN PEDRO HOPES TOURISTS TURN THE TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Karl Sanger attended a travel industry trade show in Las Vegas in June, he 
set up shop in the booth maintained by the Long Beach Visitors and Convention 
Bureau, the people who try to attract tourists to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanger wasn't promoting Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He was promoting San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
As director of sales for the newly built Compri Hotel at the Cabrillo Marina, 
Sanger aimed to persuade tour operators that San Pedro would make a fine base 
for visitors who want to explore Southern California. And he had some success; 
a British travel agent contracted for 3,600 room nights at the 226-room Compri. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day Trips From Hotel 
</P>
<P>
The British travelers will spend seven nights at the Compri. From there, they 
will take day trips to Disneyland, Universal Studios and other tourist hot 
spots. Said Sanger: "(The tour operator) has been putting his people in Anaheim 
or he's been putting his people in downtown Los Angeles, and now he's going to 
put them here." 
</P>
<P>
Sanger's experience in Las Vegas illustrates two truths about San Pedro's 
fledgling tourism trade. First is that the business is in its infancy -- so new 
that Sanger was compelled to ally himself with nearby Long Beach, which boasts 
such nationally known attractions as the Spruce Goose and Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
But second -- and, San Pedro business leaders say, more important -- is the 
potential for San Pedro to become a tourist destination, rather than a quick 
stopping point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Ethnic Flavor 
</P>
<P>
With a string of its own waterfront attractions -- Ports O' Call Village, the 
World Cruise Center at the Port of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Maritime Museum 
and Cabrillo Marine Museum, among others -- plus a European ethnic flavor that 
is rare in other Southern California communities, San Pedro already attracts 
hundreds of thousands of day-trippers each year. Many know San Pedro as the 
point of embarkation for Catalina Island, Mexico and Alaska, among other 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
And with the new Compri, as well as a 232-room Sheraton Hotel under 
construction downtown and plans for a cruise center hotel under consideration 
by port officials, San Pedro will have plenty of room to house those visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is a very viable (economic) alternative which has not been tapped in 
San Pedro," said Leron Gubler, executive director of the San Pedro Peninsula 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is here," Gubler said. "We have easy freeway access, we're on 
the water, we're the port, we have excellent restaurants. . . . In the past, 
we've had people coming down for a day to go to Catalina or Ports O' Call 
Village, but we've got to get them to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Said John Clayton, who specializes in public relations for the tourism industry 
and serves on the newly established San Pedro Tourism Council: 
</P>
<P>
"I think coming to San Pedro offers a whole different experience. . . . How 
wonderful to come down here instead of the smoggy interiors of Anaheim and some 
of these other places. How wonderful to be in all this history and atmosphere 
and still be freeway-close, and to be right on the water. . . . I think if it's 
properly publicized it has enormous potential." 
</P>
<P>
There are no comprehensive statistics that document how many people visit San 
Pedro each year, how many stay overnight or how many might elect to stay in San 
Pedro instead of elsewhere. The Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau 
lumps San Pedro in with the rest of the greater Los Angeles area, which hosted 
an estimated 48.3 million overnight visitors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However: 
</P>
<P>
* Ports O' Call Village attracts more than 1.1 million visitors each year, 
according to its merchants association, and the parking lot there is so jammed 
on weekends that the merchants recently voted to recommend that the village cut 
back on advertising in order to avoid frustrating visitors who can't find a 
place to park. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 250,000 cruise ship passengers travel through the port's World 
Cruise Center annually. A port official estimated that 40% of those passengers 
live 50 or more miles from Los Angeles and would provide a primary target for 
San Pedro's hotel industry. An additional 300,000 passengers, most from the Los 
Angeles area, travel between San Pedro and Catalina Island each year. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles Maritime Museum received 103,000 visitors last year, at least 
half of whom live beyond Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, according to 
museum Director William Lee. "Certainly during the summertime we get an awful 
lot of out-of-town visitors," Lee said. "We get a lot of people who come down 
to board the ships or who are stopping over." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro business people would like to capitalize on these numbers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key to Economic Future 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce sees tourism as the key to the economic future of San 
Pedro, not only because it will be good for existing businesses but, Gubler 
says, because it will create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
With San Pedro's traditional industries -- shipbuilding and canning -- on the 
decline, the community has lost more than 5,000 jobs in the 1980s. Gubler says 
tourism is a good way to replace them, although not everyone in San Pedro 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of new hotels going up and everybody is trumpeting growth and 
tourism," said Greg Smith, a community leader. "I'm not convinced that the 
economic future of San Pedro should be as tied to tourism as to other things, 
like high-tech. . . . Tourism tends to be low-paying jobs; it's not a good 
economic base. It's OK for a few people to operate cruise ships and run 
restaurants, but in terms of the grunt work, it's not a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Gubler concedes that the jobs created by tourism -- for hotel workers and 
waiters, for example -- do not pay nearly as well as the shipbuilding and 
canning positions that were lost. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he insists, tourism "is essential if San Pedro is to remain alive and 
vital. If we do not do this, San Pedro will become little more than a bedroom 
community." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to spur the tourism trade, and to prepare for the coming hotel 
boom, the chamber brought together about two dozen San Pedro business people 
and created the tourism council in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Rely on L.A. Bureau 
</P>
<P>
Gubler says San Pedro can no longer afford to rely on the Los Angeles Visitors 
and Convention Bureau, which he said has not adequately promoted San Pedro. The 
bureau's president, Bill Miller, acknowledged that with such a vast area to 
cover, it is impossible for his organization to tailor its promotional 
campaigns to any particular community. 
</P>
<P>
"While we're promoting Los Angeles and its regions," Miller said, "San Pedro 
will have to look for the specific identity and hook, if you will, that will 
tie the name San Pedro to something in the consumer's mind." 
</P>
<P>
The visitors and convention bureau considers San Pedro a coastal community, and 
markets it as such, lumping it in with beach cities such as Manhattan, Hermosa 
and Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
But San Pedro, although it does have a beach, is far from a beach city. Jayme 
Wilson, San Pedro Tourism Council president, says the main challenge of his 
group is to create name recognition for San Pedro by drawing attention to the 
features that make it different. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the council's first major project was printing a slick, four-color 
tourist brochure, far more elaborate than previous pamphlets put out by the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The "Official 1989-90 Chamber of Commerce Visitor's Guide," which came off the 
presses two weeks ago, lists restaurants, hotels and San Pedro points of 
interest, both on the waterfront and elsewhere in town. The Angels Gate 
Cultural Center, the Point Fermin Lighthouse and the Korean Friendship Bell are 
all on the list, in addition to such port-related activities as dinner cruises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Service Planned 
</P>
<P>
The tourism council printed 56,000 of the brochures, which were financed mostly 
by advertising, and has contracted with a company that will place the pamphlets 
in racks at hotels, the cruise center and other places frequented by travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The second project planned by the group is a shuttle service that will link San 
Pedro's various attractions. The San Pedro Revitalization Corp., which oversees 
an effort to upgrade the community's downtown business district, is drawing up 
a plan for the shuttle, which the tourism council hopes will be partially 
funded by the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although port officials have made no commitment to finance the shuttle, Mark 
Richter, assistant director of property management, said the Harbor Department 
is "quite willing to cooperate in that effort." 
</P>
<P>
Richter also said the Harbor Department expects to decide by the end of the 
month whether it will build San Pedro's third new hotel, this one at the port's 
World Cruise Center. He said the department is reviewing two proposals, one for 
a 240-room hotel and the other for a 180-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Compri and the Sheraton, San Pedro already has two other 
hotels, the 60-room San Pedro Grand on Gaffey Street and the 112-room Best 
Western Sunrise on Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Some in San Pedro, particularly Gubler and Manny Aftergut, director of 
development for the lead partner in the Sheraton Hotel project, have expressed 
concerns that the market might not be able to bear another major hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Richter said that the concern is "a very serious consideration" and that the 
port has conducted a marketing study to examine what effect another hotel would 
have on the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to release the study, Richter noted that activity along 
the San Pedro waterfront, including two new dinner cruise vessels and sport 
fishing operations, are doing well. Ports O' Call Village, which grossed $23.9 
million in sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, has grossed about 
$25 million this fiscal year, Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly," he said, "San Pedro is not comparable with a Disneyland or an 
attraction of that kind, but as a waterfront setting with some interesting 
sights and attractions, I think there is excellent potential."

Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 291 to 123, the House approved a fiscal 1990 budget of $1.6 
billion for itself and congressional support agencies. That is an increase of 
14% over the comparable fiscal 1989 bill. After the Senate adds its budget of 
more than $400 million, the cost of operating the legislative branch in 1990 
will top $2 billion. Members' salaries of nearly $50 million are funded 
separately.

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 206 to 219, the House refused to further restrict abortion in the 
District of Columbia. The defeated amendment sought to renew a ban on the 
district using its own revenue as well as its federal payment to provide 
abortions for the poor. It also sought to toughen the ban so that the 
district's own money could no longer be spent on abortions deemed necessary 
because the mother's life is at stake.

Savings and Loan Rescue

By a vote of 170 to 250, the House rejected a GOP attempt to put the cost of 
the savings and loan rescue off the federal budget. The vote kept the thrift 
bailout bill from being sent back to a House-Senate conference committee where 
the off-budget language was to have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the bill was returned to conference. 
</P>

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 291 to 123, the House approved a fiscal 1990 budget of $1.6 
billion for itself and congressional support agencies. That is an increase of 
14% over the comparable fiscal 1989 bill. After the Senate adds its budget of 
more than $400 million, the cost of operating the legislative branch in 1990 
will top $2 billion. Members' salaries of nearly $50 million are funded 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Among items in the House-passed bill are $188 million for the salaries of House 
members' personal staffs (up 5% from comparable 1989 figure), $118 million for 
committee operations including staff salaries (up 7%) and $123 million for 
House members' and senators' free-mail privileges. The postage sum is 
open-ended and likely to be increased, despite new language reducing from six 
to four the number of mass mailings House members can send to constituents each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Cutting Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 167 to 246, the House rejected an amendment cutting nearly all 
areas of the 1990 legislative branch budget (above) by 6.25%, for a savings of 
$97 million. "What used to be called the '$1-billion Congress' has become the 
'$2-billion Congress,' " said amendment sponsor Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) Opponent 
Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) said the amendment "would cut some items that are very 
fundamental in terms of the members' ability to work around this place." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a 6.25% cut in the fiscal 1990 legislative branch 
budget.

Debt Limit

The House voted 231 to 185 to raise the national debt ceiling by $70 billion to 
about $2.87 trillion. The new limit, which was sent to the Senate, will enable 
the government to pay its bills while awaiting congressional approval of a 
separate measure putting the federal borrowing limit at $3.123 trillion. 
</P>

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 206 to 219, the House refused to further restrict abortion in the 
District of Columbia. The defeated amendment sought to renew a ban on the 
district using its own revenue as well as its federal payment to provide 
abortions for the poor. It also sought to toughen the ban so that the 
district's own money could no longer be spent on abortions deemed necessary 
because the mother's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred during debate on the D.C. appropriations bill for fiscal 
1990, later sent to the Senate. It liberalizes federal abortion law as it is 
applied to D.C. But the federal city remains severely restricted in using money 
it gets from the U.S. Treasury for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to further restrict public funding of abortions in 
D.C.

Savings and Loan Rescue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 170 to 250, the House rejected a GOP attempt to put the cost of 
the savings and loan rescue off the federal budget. The vote kept the thrift 
bailout bill from being sent back to a House-Senate conference committee where 
the off-budget language was to have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the bill was returned to conference, following the Senate's 
refusal to waive the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to permit counting the 
multibillion-dollar bailout as part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was how to treat about $50 billion in immediate borrowing needed to 
close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts and meet insurance obligations to 
depositors. The reworked bill taken up by the House and Senate late Friday put 
$20 billion of the borrowing on this year's budget, as most Democrats wanted, 
and left the remaining $30 billion to be raised by industry bonds as advocated 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported an off-budget financing arrangement for the 
savings and loan bailout.

BEHIND APPLE CHEEKS IS 'MR. RELENTLESS'; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN ANELLO JR. PUSHES HARD TO MAKE COUNTY'S ONLY FULL-SERVICE JAZZ LABEL A 
SUCCESS 
</P>

At first glance, John Anello Jr. would never fulfill anyone's vision of a 
recording company mini-mogul. Baby-faced, apple-cheeked and slight of stature, 
this guitarist, composer and businessman has an unassuming appearance that 
offers little evidence of his nickname, "Mr. Relentless" -- until he begins to 
talk. Then, in a choppy stream of nonstop sentences peppered with laughs, 
asides and mimicry, it all becomes clear. Anello is a man whose energy level 
only knows one setting: high. 
</P>
<P>
As the proprietor, producer, promoter, sometime-artist and chief cook and 
bottle washer for Cexton Records, Orange County's only full-service jazz record 
company, Anello learned very early on that he either does it himself, or it 
doesn't get done. 
</P>
<P>
And what he has done since forming the label in 1983 includes performing, 
recording and promoting a couple of his own albums plus releasing seven albums 
by other acts he has signed. In 1989 alone, Cexton released six albums, and 
there are more to come before the year is out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like some of the older, more established labels that just release 
albums and let them go," Anello, 35, said last week during a conversation in 
the Harbor Boulevard offices of Cexton in Costa Mesa. "We are kicking serious 
buns on promotion, because we have to. I can't buy my way in. I'm not Warners. 
I can't buy the front cover of Billboard. I can't even buy the back cover of 
Billboard. I can't throw the big Hollywood parties. 
</P>
<P>
"So what I do every day is I come in here at 6 or 7 in the morning, get on the 
phone and call all over the country until the end of the day. That, plus a 
flurry of press releases, plus just being in people's faces is what does the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why my engineer started calling me 'Mr. Relentless.' Because if 
somebody won't take my call the first time, I'll call them until I get to them. 
Or I'll mail them or I'll send roses, or I'll do whatever I have to do. But 
sooner or later, I'll get to them." 
</P>
<P>
Anello's persistence was apparent early in his career, when, after failing to 
reach the president of a major record company, he showed up wearing a uniform 
and carrying a pizza box. Explaining that he was delivering lunch, he bluffed 
his way to the executive's inner sanctum and opened the pizza box to reveal the 
master recording he was trying to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his persistence, however, Anello struck out. Like so many other young 
performers he was unable to persuade a major label to take a chance on him. To 
the hyperactive Anello, the next step was obvious; he'd put out his own record. 
</P>
<P>
If he had followed the familiar costly path of other neophyte artists, he would 
have released the album -- at considerable personal cost -- sold a few here and 
there at concerts, and given the majority of copies away to friends and 
relatives. But Anello had his own way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
He produced a first-rate album, "For A Dancer," in 1983 for an out-of-pocket 
cost of $8,000. It had a cover shot by a photographer whose work has appeared 
in Cosmopolitan, a high-quality pressing and a polyvinyl sleeve -- all the 
stuff of a quality product. The next step was to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy," Anello laughed. "I sold it out of the back of my truck, I 
hustled distributors, I tried direct mail . . . everything, you name it, just 
to get the album out there." 
</P>
<P>
Anello's perseverance paid off. The album hit Billboard's jazz chart at No. 28 
and climbed into the Top 20 -- an amazing performance in today's market for a 
self-produced and self-distributed recording. 
</P>
<P>
"It did so well," he explained, "that people began to call me and ask about 
more product. So I knew I had to do a second album. I did that one -- 'Jackson 
Street Beat' (in 1985) -- the same way, and it did even better. It got more 
airplay and did well overseas, especially in Japan. And I was doing all this 
while I was still working a full schedule as a junior high school music 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time things were different. When I did my first album, everybody 
asked for more. When I did my second album I realized that if I was going to 
have a real record company, I had to release product not just by me, but by 
other people too. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative was to sell my masters and my mailing lists and so forth to 
another, bigger label, and I didn't want to do that. So I decided to stop 
teaching full time and go head first into the record business." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates that Cexton has shipped more than 50,000 albums and has had sales 
of "more than a couple hundred thousand dollars" since starting the label. But 
he says the gains -- the financial, not the personal -- come slowly. "It's 
still a day-by-day existence. At the end of each month I look and see if 
there's any money left over, and if there is, we put it into another project." 
</P>
<P>
Anello, born in Newark, N.J., is the son of an alto saxophonist and educator, 
John Anello Sr., who was active in the New York and New Jersey music scene in 
the '50s and '60s. When his father was offered a teaching job in Orange County 
in the late '60s, the family moved West. Anello Sr. eventually wound up in an 
executive job at Disneyland and Anello Jr. graduated with a music degree from 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Anello feels that his high-energy personal style traces directly to growing up 
on the East Coast in a vigorous Italian neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've been influenced by a combination of the American work ethic and 
the Italian sense of family," he mused. "It's that constant driving that's so 
much a part of the back-East mentality. I get frustrated by the fact that I 
sometimes get more done in a day than some people do in a week. 
</P>
<P>
"And I suppose another part of it is just my own personal drive. I always had 
to work twice as hard for half as much. In school, I never got easy grades. I 
got good grades, but I had to work for them, and when I didn't, I got bad 
grades. And I was never really popular, so whatever popularity I had, I had to 
work for it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started playing gigs, I was never the first musician picked. I always 
had to work hard to get any attention at all. But I learned that I could do 
something about it. I discovered that when I get the momentum up, I'm like a 
steamship -- don't get in my way." 
</P>
<P>
Anello's momentum has carried Cexton to an extremely active year. Six CDs have 
been released in 1989, with more to follow. The performers are, for the most 
part, true to Anello's belief in straight-ahead, mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal," he said, "is for Cexton to be a true mainstream label, a be-bop 
label, a live-jazz label, very much in the style of Blue Note Records in the 
1950s and '60s." 
</P>
<P>
The one difference: Blue Note's roster was dominated by black jazz performers. 
Cexton's, at the moment, has none. When asked about it, Anello expressed some 
uneasiness about his monochromatic lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"It concerns me a lot," he said, "but it's certainly not by choice. When I 
started adding artists, I was picking from tapes by performers I'd never seen. 
Some I met by phone, but I had no knowledge of who I was getting. So, 
partially, it was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
"The other part of it is that, of the tapes I got from black artists -- and I 
didn't get a lot -- most were R&amp;B. One black jazz artist I was interested 
in was already under contract with another record company. . . . We are now 
talking seriously to four or five black artists, one of whom has already agreed 
to come on board. Basically everything's done except the ink on the contract to 
have his music in the catalogue by next year." 
</P>
<P>
All plans are, of course, contingent upon Cexton's continued financial good 
health. At the moment, things look bright. The overhead is low, sales are up 
and good word of mouth about the upstart little jazz record company from the 
wilds of Orange County is beginning to spread. 
</P>
<P>
Anello is typically upbeat. Workaholic he may be, but he does his best to 
balance the heavy business schedule with the relaxation of a regular Sunday 
pasta party at his home. "I try to hang on to a sense of family," he said, "by 
bringing the people I work with into my own family. The Sunday pastas are a way 
of bringing us all together -- musicians, friends, business acquaintances, my 
wife (Susan Marie), my little girl (Marie Christine) and me. The funny thing is 
that I'm probably the only one who's Italian at the pastas. But if there's 
anything that's been passed on to me that I can share with my friends, it's my 
music and my pasta." 
</P>
<P>
As if wary that the image of the paterfamilias might sully his reputation as a 
hard-driven overachiever, Anello suddenly remembered he had some urgent phone 
calls to make. 
</P>
<P>
With that, "Mr. Relentless" was already pushing buttons on his telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is," he said, "that for me nothing's ever good enough or fast 
enough. So as soon as I finish something, the first thing that comes into my 
mind is 'What am I going to do next? What's the next project?' I don't think I 
could function any other way."

A CEXTON SAMPLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the better releases from the growing Cexton catalogue are: 
</P>
<P>
JOHN ANELLO JR. 
</P>
<P>
"For a Dancer" 
</P>
<P>
"Jackson Street Beat" 
</P>
<P>
Light, melodic pop jazz by "Mr. Relentless" himself, who turns out to be a 
surprisingly gentle performer. Anello's sprightly melodies dominate both 
recordings, along with a few strong passages from John Anello Sr.'s alto 
saxophone and flute. 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT KREITZER 
</P>
<P>
"Kick 'N Off" 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Kreitzer plays his instrument with a brisk majestic authority 
rarely heard in younger players (he is 23). His admiration of Sonny Rollins is 
most notably apparent during a tour de force romp through "Airegin." A strong 
rhythm section of Dave Samuels on vibes, Marc Cohen on piano, Harvie Swartz on 
bass and Bill Stewart on drums provides sturdy support, but the addition of a 
string section on several tracks is an unnecessary distraction from the 
otherwise strong jazz proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
BIG WORLD 
</P>
<P>
"Devotion" 
</P>
<P>
A fascinating recording from a trio -- pianist Rick Helzer, flutist/saxist Bill 
Plake and percussionist Jeanette Wrate -- that ranges from avant-garde to 
off-the-wall hard bop. Their performance of Ornette Coleman's "Lonely Woman" 
perfectly captures the song's essence of timeworn sadness. The only thing 
missing is the resonant undercurrent of a strong bass line (Charlie Haden would 
sound terrific with this group). 
</P>
<P>
LOREN PICKFORD 
</P>
<P>
"Song For A Blue Planet" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the New Age-sounding title, alto saxophonist Pickford's album is pure 
mainstream jazz. Accompanied by a strong supporting cast that includes George 
Roessler on guitar, George Cables on piano, John Heard on bass and Billy 
Higgins on drums, Pickford applies his warm-toned instrument to a set of golden 
standards ("Skylark"; "Alone Together") and originals. 
</P>
<P>
CHIZ HARRIS 
</P>
<P>
"Confirmation" 
</P>
<P>
A straight-ahead blowing session, recorded "live" in the studio with an 
audience. Drummer Harris, a longtime Orange County jazz figure, leads a group 
that includes saxophonist Jay Migliori, pianist Joe Lettieri and bassist Isla 
Eckinger. Guest trumpeter-fluegelhornist Conte Candoli provides added spice to 
steaming, be-bop brew. 
</P>
<P>
Other current Cexton releases include: "Leap of Faith" from Rob Silvan and the 
eclectic vocal scat singing of Fine Line; "Spirit of Light," a pop-jazz 
collection from a group called Axiom; and "This Was Meant To Be," featuring the 
original songs of singer Barbara Reed. Scheduled for release in the next few 
months are albums from trombonist Mike Fahn and guitarist Robert Conti. DON

Tecate Update -- A group of residents working to protect a rare grove of Tecate 
cypress trees in the northeast corner of Orange County is closely watching the 
county's efforts to find a new landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is expected to act Wednesday on a staff recommendation 
to cut the list of potential sites to three, with Gypsum Canyon among the 
finalists (see Briefing, above). According to Gordon Ruser, treasurer of 
Friends of the Tecate Cypress, the proposed dump could eventually, under one 
plan, wipe out 200 to 300 acres of the total 1,000 acres of the trees. The 
county jail proposed for Gypsum Canyon would, by contrast, affect about seven 
acres of trees. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Spenger, president of the Friends group, said the county has been 
working with an outdated map of the area that does not show the full extent of 
the Tecate cypress grove. She plans to deliver an updated map to the county on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The isolated Orange County groves, now found in portions of Gypsum, Coal and 
Fremont canyons near the Riverside Freeway, mark the northern limit of the 
species' range. There are also some trees at sites in San Diego County and at 
Tecate Mountain, near the Mexican border town of Tecate. The tree is classified 
as rare by the California Native Plant Society and will be considered for 
threatened status by the state later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The trees also help support a variety of wildlife, including four plants that 
are under consideration for federal endangered species status -- the 
heart-leaved pitcher sage, dense reed-grass, Braunton's milk-vetch and 
many-stemmed dudleya -- along with the coast horned lizard, also a candidate 
for endangered listing. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the Tecate front, negotiations continue for the purchase of the 
so-called Coal Canyon property with $4 million provided by last year's passage 
of Proposition 70, a park bond measure. The property, which comprises sections 
of Gypsum, Coal and Fremont canyons, would include about half the total Tecate 
cypress trees and some buffer land. Spenger said the purchase should be 
completed some time early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitive property would be maintained as an ecological reserve and would 
not be developed, except for some possible informational displays. Hiking and 
equestrian activities would probably be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Events -- Oak Canyon Nature Center in Anaheim Hills focuses on birds Saturday, 
with an 8 a.m. guided bird walk followed by a 10 a.m. program. "Chaparral: 
Awaiting the Rains" is the title of the program planned for the nature center 
for 10 a.m. on Aug. 26. For information on either event, call (714) 998-8380.

A pair of commercial developments proposed for Cook's Corner in the foothills 
east of Mission Viejo will be the subject of a staff presentation and public 
hearing Tuesday before the county Planning Commission. The two projects, 
totaling more than 105,000 square feet of commercial and office space, include 
a series of retail shops, a gas station and a mini-mart. One of the projects is 
targeted for the current site of the famed Cook's Corner tavern, but developers 
say the roadhouse would be incorporated in the project.

The County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday will decide whether to narrow the 
list of possible sites for a new landfill in northern Orange County to three. 
County officials have spent more than a year looking at more than half a dozen 
potential sites, and county staff is recommending that the choices be narrowed 
to three: Olinda-Alpha Canyon, Gypsum Canyon and West Fremont Canyon. If the 
recommendation is adopted, county officials will begin a new round of 
environmental impact reports on each of those sites with a selection of a new 
landfill sometime early next year.

On Monday, the Costa Mesa Planning Commission will hear arguments for and 
against a proposed 24-bed halfway house for recovering alcoholics and drug 
addicts in the city's College Park neighborhood. The planned expansion of an 
existing six-bed halfway house operated by a father-and-son team, both 
recovering alcoholics, has drawn opposition from nearby residents who fear that 
the facility would attract drunks and homeless people.

SURFING AT SALT CREEK STATE BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
PARMENTER ADVANCES AFTER A BRUSH WITH INTERLOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few minutes Saturday, professional surfer John Parmenter became an 
amateur enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
A renegade surfer strayed into the competition zone at the start of his 
sixth-round heat in the Dive N' Surf Pro-Am surfing tournament, and when the 
surfer refused to leave, Parmenter got tough. 
</P>
<P>
"He was at least 6-1," the stocky Parmenter said afterward, "but Mike Tyson is 
5-10." 
</P>
<P>
Although Parmenter threw no punches, he used his surfboard to spear the 
"longboarder" when he came at him. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't have been out there," said Parmenter, of Huntington Beach. "There 
should have been lifeguards (to stop him). I gave him a ding in the board and 
in the leg." 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to scare off the interloper, but Parmenter said he was so 
distracted, he almost lost the heat. He finished second to Dino Andino of San 
Clemente. The top two in each heat of four qualified for the quarterfinals at 
9:25 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Parmenter and Andino were two of 13 Orange County surfers to advance in the 
event at Salt Creek Beach Park in Laguna Niguel. Only three of the 
quarterfinalists reside outside the county, and only one, Rich Rudolph of 
Florida, lives outside California. The Orange County qualifiers included San 
Clemente's Shane Beschen, 17, the only amateur to make it, and Dana Point's 
Mike Cruickshank. Cruickshank, 31, qualified on a spare surfboard after 
breaking a fin in an altercation with an unauthorized bodyboarder during 
practice, minutes before his heat. 
</P>
<P>
The surfers had enough problems with the waves without battling 
non-competitors. Each surfer is judged on his best four of 10 rides in a 
20-minute heat. Because of inconsistent waves, some surfers had trouble turning 
in four good rides. 
</P>
<P>
One casualty was Oceanside's Mike Lambresi, the top-seeded surfer. The two-time 
defending champion of the Bud Pro Surfing Tour lost in his first round of 
surfing -- the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of his high ranking, Lambresi was excused from the early rounds, 
which began Wednesday. But he was upset by Gary Clisby of Huntington Beach and 
Randy Wright of Venice. With Lambresi out, the favorites become third-seeded 
Andino and second-seeded Todd Chesser of San Diego, who also qualified. The 
semifinals are set to start at 11:35 a.m. today, and the final is at 12:50 p.m. 
today. The bodyboarding competition resumes at 8 a.m. today. Of the 16 
bodyboarding quarterfinalists, eight live in Orange County.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troy Babbitt went five for five, including two home runs and five RBIs, to help 
the Orange County Cardinals to a 14-3 victory over Madison Heights, Mich., in a 
first-round game of the Connie Mack World Series Saturday in Farmington, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt, a second baseman who will be a senior at Western High School this 
fall, hit a two-run home run in the first inning. His second home run opened 
the seventh. Babbitt doubled and scored in the third, had an RBI single in the 
fifth and an RBI single in the seventh as the Cardinals scored six runs to take 
a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Bates from Esperanza High School had two hits and scored three runs for 
the Cardinals, who will play Farmington tonight. Winning pitcher Craig Clayton 
(7-1 this season) pitched the first six innings for the victory and also had a 
home run. The Cardinals are 30-4. Madison Heights is 27-6.

CONTROVERSY DOGS TUSTIN FIRM'S LASERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enamored of the magic of lasers, Wall Street a year ago believed that Trimedyne 
Inc., a small Orange County biotech company, would burn a sure path to success. 
It grew rapidly after winning the race to market the first laser designed to 
open plaque-clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the company that set out to revolutionize the treatment of 
cardiovascular disease has fallen on hard times, proving that it takes more to 
win the following of the medical profession than a sales seal of approval from 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The stock in the Tustin firm, after soaring to $24 a share last August, has 
plunged to $6.75 in the wake of the decline in business. Sales and earnings 
have been sliding for nine months, and after eight consecutive profitable 
quarters, the company reported a loss: $546,000 for the fiscal third quarter 
ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne officials say that profits are depressed in part because the company 
has substantially stepped up its spending for marketing and new product 
research and development to prepare for the future. Wall Street was "spoiled" 
by the company's extraordinary earnings growth last year, they say. But far 
more troubling for the company's prospects is a dispute that has emerged over 
the effectiveness of the technology on which Trimedyne has built its business. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been mixed results. There is no lack of controversy" over the value 
of the technology, said David L. Duclos, medical technology analyst with 
Wessels, Arnold &amp; Henderson, a securities brokerage in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
It did not begin that way. In March, 1987, Trimedyne obtained permission from 
the FDA to begin marketing the first laser device that could sear through 
clogged leg arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne promoted the device as a breakthrough in the fight against 
cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular problems, through strokes and heart 
attacks, are the leading cause of death in this country, and they account for 
$85 billion of the nation's annual health-care budget. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's laser-heated metal probe held the promise of being able to bore 
through otherwise impassable arteries, thus making bypass surgery unnecessary. 
With the laser, it was hoped, patients could be treated at far less cost and 
with much less pain. Laser-assisted treatment of blocked arteries costs $6,000 
to $8,000, Trimedyne says; the cost of bypass surgery, by contrast, is $20,000 
to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FDA approved the Trimedyne probe only as a treatment for 
arteriosclerosis in the legs, the company was expected to soon penetrate the 
much larger and lucrative market for treatment of blocked heart arteries. 
Trimedyne has estimated potential laser-system sales of $1 billion a year for 
leg and heart applications together. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the FDA determined that the Trimedyne laser was safe and effective 
enough, sales of the device exploded. In little more than two years, the 
company has sold 550 lasers to medical centers worldwide and more than 25,000 
patients have been treated with them, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
The initial welcome that the medical profession offered the laser technology 
was enough to take the company's sales from $12 million for its fiscal 1987 to 
$31 million for its fiscal 1988, and also to prompt the company to move to 
larger quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Fell Off 
</P>
<P>
But laser sales began tapering off last winter amid reports that many of the 
doctors who had plunked down $96,000 apiece for the lasers were using them 
little, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, reports of studies conducted at UCI Medical Center and at Mount 
Sinai Medical Center in New York concluded that the Trimedyne laser probe 
causes complications that include perforations of artery walls and that it may 
not be any more effective than older mechanical and much less expensive 
treatments such as angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne also began facing competition. Another company recently obtained FDA 
approval to market a raw laser energy system for treating leg arteries, and 
many other competitors are developing devices that they predict will cut into 
Trimedyne's market share. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Trimedyne laser, physicians were treating blocked arteries without 
surgery using a technique called "balloon angioplasty," in which a tiny balloon 
is threaded through an artery on a catheter, then expanded to crush the plaque 
and open a path for blood to flow. 
</P>
<P>
The Trimedyne laser has not replaced balloon angioplasty; rather, it works in 
tandem. The Trimedyne device is a catheter tipped with metal that is heated by 
laser energy, and it is intended to open a passageway through the most densely 
clogged arteries; after the passageway is opened, a balloon catheter can be 
inserted. 
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the laser could open arteries that balloon angioplasty alone 
could not and that it would significantly reduce the high incidence of 
recurring blockages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Results of UCI Study 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jonathan Tobis, a cardiologist at UC Irvine, said the hypothesis was that 
the laser-heated probe would bore through the middle of an artery by vaporizing 
the calcified plaque in its path. Instead, he said, a study at UCI, published 
in the June issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, shows 
that the laser probe vaporizes very little plaque and that it takes a path of 
least resistance through arteries in much the same way a purely mechanical 
device such as a wire would. 
</P>
<P>
Tobis said he found that although the laser does not penetrate plaque, it will 
sometimes burn holes in the artery itself. 
</P>
<P>
Even more detrimental to Trimedyne's stature on Wall Street was a report on a 
clinical study of the Trimedyne laser presented by Dr. Martin Harrington of 
Mount Sinai Medical Center. Harrington made his remarks at a meeting of the 
International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery in June in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The study tracked the results of Trimedyne laser treatments on 64 patients. In 
some, according to a summary, the treatment resulted in puncture wounds and 
bleeding that in one case led to death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Should Be Studied' 
</P>
<P>
Harrington said in an interview that in 20% of the cases, the laser probe was 
not able to cut through the plaque. "And in about half of the cases in which 
the laser opened the artery," he said, "the passage blocked up again within 
eight months." 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that they probably have to do more work on the laser," 
Harrington said. "We think it is something that should be studied in a few 
centers. I wouldn't say every hospital in town or even every city should have 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Cooper, Trimedyne president and chief executive, bristles at the mention 
of the Mount Sinai report, which precipitated an immediate drop in Trimedyne's 
stock price. He said the study involved exceptionally severe cases of artery 
disease. He also contends that the results "are more positive than portrayed," 
because, he said, in most instances the laser therapy prevented the need for 
amputation. He argued that the results of most other clinical studies of the 
Trimedyne laser have been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper defends the importance of the Trimedyne laser, but he also acknowledges 
that current laser technology is such that it cannot be seen as the cure for 
artery blockages. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, when we got FDA approval, we were optimistic that every leg" with 
an artery blockage "could be treated with the laser," he said. "Now it looks as 
if we could treat 30% of the cases." 
</P>
<P>
He says he also would like to see a lower recurrence rate for blockages in legs 
treated with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. It ranges from 7% to 45%, he 
said, depending on the severity of the original blockage. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they were not surprised by the shortcomings of the Trimedyne 
laser, which they consider a first-generation technology. They point out, 
though, that they often have difficulty convincing their patients that lasers 
are not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"We have patients who read articles in the newspapers who think lasers are the 
miracle cure for vascular disease, and there is no question they are not," said 
Dr. Barry T. Katzen, director of the Miami Vascular Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Doering, a vascular surgeon at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, said 
the hospital owns a Trimedyne laser system but that it has used it in fewer 
than "a dozen cases" in the last year and a half. "I'm convinced it has a very 
limited place in the treatment of patients with obstructed arteries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Dr. Ted Diethrich, cardiovascular surgeon and medical director of 
the Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix, has used the Trimedyne laser in more 
patients -- 1,800 -- than any other physician. Diethrich says that it has 
helped to clear 75% of leg arteries that otherwise would be impenetrable. He 
adds that the recurrence of artery blockage with the laser-assisted treatment 
is only 10% less than occurs after using balloon angioplasty alone. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Trimedyne laser system is effective for the heart is even more 
uncertain, vascular surgeons and cardiologists say. The uncertainty is partly 
because fewer procedures have been performed in the heart. Application of a hot 
laser probe in the heart is more difficult, they say, because heart arteries 
are narrower, they twist more, and any mishap would pose considerably more 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
Diethrich said that he has participated in surgical trials using the Trimedyne 
laser-heated probe in the heart for two years and that he is "not too 
enthusiastic" about the results. "We can't get across the lesions" with the 
Laserprobe "in a high percentage of cases" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the major disappointment with the Trimedyne system is that it probably 
is not going to be useful in the heart," said Dr. Frank Litvack, co-director of 
the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los 
Angeles. There is concern, he said, that a hot probe inserted in a tiny 
coronary artery can cause spasms or clotting. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Trimedyne, which has been testing a coronary laser in human clinical 
trials since 1986, expects to file an application for FDA marketing approval 
before the end of the year, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Loeb, Trimedyne's chairman and founder, predicted that if such approval 
is obtained, the company's earnings would again increase dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Litvack, however, said he believes that the Trimedyne technology "will be 
supplanted by simpler and more effective technology both in the laser field and 
in non-laser mechanical devices." 
</P>
<P>
Litvack said he is a consultant to a company that is developing an excimer 
laser, a so-called "cold laser" that cuts through plaque with short bursts of 
ultraviolet light. This laser eliminates the heat that may damage an artery. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne officials responded that most of such touted new technologies have 
not been proven. Moreover, they stress that Trimedyne is not standing still. 
</P>
<P>
Since obtaining FDA approval for the first laser-heated probe, Trimedyne has 
obtained clearance to market 10 more leg artery probes of different sizes. It 
also has begun marketing a newer device that combines laser heat with the 
emission of a bare laser light that they believe shows more promise in cutting 
through calcified plaque. And further down the Trimedyne research and 
development pipeline is a cold laser system of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks once you've got an FDA approval, you don't need to do any 
more research and development," Cooper said. "High technology doesn't work that 
way, particularly in the biomedical field." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said that Trimedyne is still a developing-stage company that should not 
be expected to sustain the quarter-to-quarter growth that impresses Wall Street 
investors. He said that the company has a strong balance sheet and that it is 
paying for all of its research from revenue, without taking on debt. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's decision to go public in 1982 was necessary to help it raise funds 
to develop its laser technology and enter commercial production, Cooper said. 
In all, the company has raised $11.8 million through a combination of private 
and public stock sales and warrants. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees that Trimedyne must sell more lasers and persuade doctors to use the 
lasers they have. Trimedyne's long-term business strategy relies heavily on 
repeat business from the sale of probes, which cost $460 to $625 apiece and are 
disposed of after each use. 
</P>
<P>
The company refuses to say how many probes it has sold by quarter, which would 
show just how often the lasers are being used. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper acknowledges, however, that "short-term expectations were too high. We 
had a lot to learn about the market. It is a matter of educating the doctors." 
</P>
<P>
TRIMEDYNE: FALLING ON HARD TIMES 
</P>
<P>
A year ago Trimedyne, an Orange County bio-tech company, was headed for 
success. The excitement was centered on its approval to begin marketing the 
first laser-assisted device to open clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
THE LASERPROBE: HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
1. The physician creates a needlelike puncture and threads a thin catheter into 
the artery. 
</P>
<P>
2. The Laserprobe is inserted through the catheter. The laser's heat burns a 
tiny path through the artery. 
</P>
<P>
3. The laser is withdrawn and a tiny balloon is threaded through the artery to 
widen the channel that the Laserprobe has created. 
</P>

<P>
THE LASERPROBE: COMPLICATIONS 
</P>
<P>
Studies conducted at UC Irvine Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center in 
New York show that the Laserprobe can deflect off the hardest plaque, in some 
cases perforating the artery.
