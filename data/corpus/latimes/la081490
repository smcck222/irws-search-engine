AID FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles just may be the City of Angeles. The parents of the high school 
students are apt to believe it when they learn what the operations people of 
Northwest Airlines at Los Angeles International Airport did last month. 
</P>
<P>
When Northwest's Flight 190 was being buttoned down for its 12:30 p.m. 
departure, nearly half of a group of 40 Japanese high school students were 
still mired in U.S. Customs following their long flight from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest put compassion over schedule and waited more than an hour until the 
final one of the group, none of whom could speak English, was on board. They 
were, in fact, bound for the Puget Sound area for a three-week intensive 
English language course preparatory to going on to Phoenix and a yearlong 
exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the flight attendants said, "We wanted to do everything possible to 
keep the group together. Most of us (passengers and crew), are parents and 
that's how we would want our youngsters treated -- especially in a foreign 
country."

DISNEY'S PLANS FOR LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Robert Jones' column "Disney Takes Theming to a New Extreme," 
Aug. 7: 
</P>
<P>
Take it back, Mr. Jones. Those of us who work and/or live in downtown Long 
Beach do not feel as if we're anywhere near a sunny, but decimated Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
We like it here. 
</P>
<P>
We like driving down Ocean Boulevard and seeing the minarets of our historic 
Villa Riviera juxtaposed against the already-ahead of schedule, 20-story Harbor 
Place Tower project. 
</P>
<P>
We like watching our hard-hatted minions putting the final touches on the 
gleaming, marble skin of Landmark Square, our high-rise office tower due to 
open in January. 
</P>
<P>
We like to go to Pine Avenue to eat at some indisputably fine restaurants, to 
see and be seen, to gossip about our movers and shakers and to watch as the 
preliminary work on our 16-screen AMC theater, retail and apartment complex 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
We grouse about development, the torn-up streets, the noise, the traffic 
tie-ups, but all of that pales when we see the tangible magnificence of a 
completed project. Our skyscrapers are not isolated. 
</P>
<P>
As for Disney, well, theme parks are like trains. If we miss this one, another 
will be by in just a minute. We're not worried. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe we should have you talk with Bob Dylan, because he summed it up best. 
"There's something going on here, but you don't know what it is. Do you, Mr. 
Jones?"

The latest statistics on U.S. infant mortality are worse than embarrassing -- 
they are shameful. 
</P>
<P>
We now rank 21st in the world: Below the least wealthy industrialized nations, 
such as Ireland, and nearer more advanced Third World countries, such as Costa 
Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Over one-quarter of our 40,000 infant deaths each year are preventable, 
according to a report by the White House Task Force on Infant Mortality, as are 
one-fourth of the chronic or disabling conditions developed each year by 
another 400,000 babies. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration has yet to release the year-old, damning report: 
Some critics charge the delay is because the report recommends $500 million in 
new public funding for prenatal, maternal and well-baby programs. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the report is another painful reminder that U.S. health 
care -- private and public -- continues to spend money on virtually everything 
except prevention and public education. 
</P>
<P>
The report points out how economical common sense can be. Experts claim that 
each dollar spent on prenatal and maternity care -- from drug treatment to 
regular checkups -- eliminates the need for $3 worth of high-tech care later 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say the report is being "refined." But no amount of 
editing or fine-tuning can justify stalling on so vital an issue. The report 
should be released from its state of indefinite detention. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this nation is not heeding its own folk wisdom: An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure.

IRA MURDER OF BRITISH M.P. IAN GOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unfortunate the British government has such a blind spot concerning the 
question of Irish emancipation. The British would never stand for foreign 
paratroopers occupying and patrolling London and the surrounding countryside, 
yet they do that very thing in Belfast and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The latest IRA bombing of a senior British official, Ian Gow, has elicited a 
predictable response from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of 
Parliament. The Irish Republicans are labeled "terrorists" and the British vow 
never to give in or surrender to the Irish nationalists. Regrettably, the blood 
bath will continue because, after 800 years of British domination, the Irish 
will not quit, either. 
</P>
<P>
The sun has set on the British Empire and the Irish will have their freedom.

IRA MURDER OF BRITISH M.P. IAN GOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial about Northern Ireland and Irish Northern Aid (Noraid), was 
confused. Having once shared those convictions, I understand how they 
originate: with the British government's disinformation campaign. 
</P>
<P>
When I began writing about the conflict in 1985, British officials were quick 
to inform me that Noraid members were just "sentimental." In fact, I found 
Noraid members considerably better informed than their critics and that it is 
the Irish political establishment which romanticizes the War of Independence 
(which was more ruthless than today's revolt). 
</P>
<P>
The British also claimed that Noraid was funding the IRA. When I asked for 
evidence and investigated what I was given, I discovered there was not a shred 
of proof to support the assertion. There is a very simple reason why Noraid has 
never given a penny to the IRA: It is unable to raise more than a fraction for 
the needs of the families of prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
The only ones hurt by editorials calling for the defunding of Noraid are the 
prisoners' families, since the group's critics do not provide this aid (even 
though they know that many prisoners are innocent victims of a perverse legal 
system). Nor is Noraid registered with the Justice Department as an "agent of 
the IRA": This judgment was reversed on appeal because it lacked any supporting 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean individual Americans do not contribute to the IRA, but a 
statement in Parliament by a former director of British intelligence indicated 
that the amount of money from the U.S. is negligible (most coming from the 
Irish in Britain whose political outlets are suppressed). The editorial 
sanctimoniously invoked the images of democracy, rule of law and the value of 
human life to condemn those supporting the insurrection in Northern Ireland but 
these same words were used by the political establishment, clergy and media to 
condemn the IRA of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The compromises starting with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 have only 
perpetuated the tragic illusion of "peace in our time."

By CHARLES E. McGEE was one of the first black fighter pilots to serve in World 
War II and later in the Korean and Vietnam wars. He believes that U.S. military 
presence in the Middle East is justified. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a veteran and from my viewpoint, I think we have a very touchy situation in 
(the Middle East) and one that will probably be hard for people to understand 
if people get killed. It would probably be difficult for those who are not 
privy to all of the intelligence that goes into making these decisions of when 
we ought to use military power and this just happens to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
The President has chosen that option. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are Americans and a part of this country. We hope that there will be no 
significance made between black or white (military men and women during the 
crisis). We hope that they would carry out the job that is required. 
</P>
<P>
Our services for a great number of years have been made up of volunteer forces, 
not drafted forces. And perhaps a greater number of blacks have volunteered to 
serve, even if a great proportion were on the front lines in Vietnam. If they 
have been accepted on equal standards and can carry out the job, I think they 
would perform just as well. 
</P>
<P>
They are not in (the Persian Gulf) because someone is sending blacks to be the 
first to be killed. They are there because they volunteered to support this 
country and to help keep the military power of this country great. I really 
think this is often something that our populous doesn't understand and that is 
related to this, no war has been declared (in the Persian Gulf) but certainly 
military power is one of the options that our President has to keep this 
country free to keep its allies protected. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever that soldier is who has volunteered and is qualified to carry out that 
duty at the front line, he has to be color blind.

AMID MASS FRUSTRATION, AN ARAB HERO; 
</P>
<P>
PERSIAN GULF: THE KUWAIT CRISIS WILL HASTEN THE DEMISE OF THE ELITE; BUT WHEN 
SADDAM HUSSEIN FAILS, WHAT THEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FOUAD MOUGHRABI, Fouad Moughrabi is a lecturer and writer on Middle East 
affairs and professor of political science at the University of Tennessee at 
Chattanooga. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decisions of the Cairo Arab summit undoubtedly pleased the Bush 
Administration by providing an Arab cover for its efforts to dislodge Saddam 
Hussein from Kuwait. Yet their decisions represent a total failure of the Arab 
state system. The Kuwait crisis simply accelerated trends that have been under 
way for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab heads of state were unable to agree upon an Arab solution that would 
obviate the need for American and Western intervention. They opted, instead, 
for measures designed to save their governments, at the risk of further 
alienating their own people. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, conservative and radical Arab governments have relied on outside 
support while on the inside, they maintained horribly oppressive regimes. 
Soviet support, grafted onto corrupt and bureaucratic systems, was useless in 
helping Arab governments mount an effective challenge to Israel's hegemony in 
the Middle East. American support of its own client states was even more 
problematic. Unconditional U.S. assistance to Israel and reluctance to pressure 
it into adopting some compromises for peace have led erosion of popular support 
for moderate Arab governments. On the eve of the present crisis, with the 
collapse of American efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, anti-American sentiment in the Arab world reached 
its highest level in decades. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War and the decline of ideology have left the Middle East 
riddled with political, social and economic problems complicated by history and 
misguided policies. The Arab state system, a relic of colonialism, was able to 
survive in an era of ideological confrontation and superpower rivalry. It is 
uncertain whether this system will survive the stresses of economic scarcity, 
the ramifications of the present crisis, and the continued failure to resolve 
the Palestinian problem. 
</P>
<P>
As the rest of the world moves toward democracy, feeble attempts by various 
Arab governments (among them Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia) to 
adopt a multiparty system do not alter their essentially authoritarian 
structures. The average person has seen a significant loss of civil liberties 
in addition to a sharp decline in economic welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to democratize is only one of many grievances against the Arab 
governments. The list includes, among other things, the failure to respond with 
dignity to insulting U.S. policies that fuel Israel's oppression in the 
occupied territories, and the failure to put investment in human resources 
ahead of conspicuous consumption and expensive though useless weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Saddam Hussein a hero in the eyes of many people is that he has 
challenged the West, especially the United States, and dealt a severe blow to 
corrupt wealth and privilege in the Gulf. Very few Arabs admire his record on 
human rights, and even fewer forgive him for squandering valuable human and 
economic resources in his protracted war with Iran. However, in an atmosphere 
of total frustration, a leader who stands up in defiance will be respected. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 1/2 years of a costly and difficult uprising, the Palestinians, for 
example, are bitter about the failure of the United States to get Israel to the 
negotiating table. They are therefore groping for an alternative that will 
guarantee them some relief from Israel's occupation. A regional strongman who 
is perceived as a counter to Israel's intransigence may look very appealing. 
Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein is a politician who has little to offer these 
masses in terms of effective solutions to their endemic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The real danger lies in the fact that the Iraqi president may unfortunately 
represent the last chance for secular nationalism in the Arab World. His defeat 
at the hands of the United States might restore the status quo in Kuwait and in 
the region. But it will surely alter the entire geopolitical landscape for 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
What will replace the dying Arab state system? No one can predict the shape of 
things to come. One element, however, is beyond dispute. The only forces 
capable of articulating the severe alienation in the region are the Muslim 
fundamentalist groups whose power is already visible in several Arab countries. 
In a few years, the United States may be fighting even more Khomeinis in the 
Arab and Islamic worlds. The presence of American troops on Arab soil and the 
potential level of aggression to reverse Saddam Hussein's moves are likely to 
determine the depth and speed of this fundamentalist reaction.

JORDAN: THE KINGDOM IS IN BAGHDAD'S GRIP, PUTTING THE 'MODERATE' KING IN 
COMPANY WITH KADAFI AND ARAFAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SATLOFF, Robert Satloff is a fellow at the Washington Institute for 
Near East Policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein finds himself alone among "Arab moderates" in apologizing 
for the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait because he lacks the economic, military or 
even psychological strength to wrest himself free from a debilitating 
dependence on and subservience to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is by far Amman's largest trading partner, providing, for example, 
two-thirds of the kingdom's oil imports. Iraq's economic vise on Jordan extends 
to all aspects of the kingdom's economy. Three-quarters of the kindgom's 
manufactured exports go to Iraq, as does a similar proportion of activity at 
Jordan's lone port at Aqaba. The salary remittances of tens of thousands of 
Jordanian workers in Kuwait and Iraq are one of the kingdom's main sources of 
foreign exchange. And the recently signed bilateral trade protocol outlined 
$800 million worth of transactions -- about double Jordan's entire cash 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
From the Jordanian viewpoint, therefore, joining the chorus of condemnation 
would be economic suicide. Cutting economic links with Iraq, as demanded by the 
United Nations, would hurt Jordan more quickly and even more acutely than it 
would Baghdad. Barely a year after price riots occasioned by a deepening 
recession, high unemployment and the implementation of an International 
Monetary Fund austerity plan, King Hussein evidently decided that earning the 
wrath of his good friend George Bush was a reasonable price for maintaining 
domestic tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
A second, less tangible, reason for the king's behavior is the sheer disbelief 
at the enormity of the confidence game played on him by Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, Jordan has built a strategic alliance with Iraq to 
fill the gap created by the king's festering disillusionment with America and 
his growing uneasiness with Israel. The formation last April of a new, 
Likud-led Israeli government, in which virtually every minister has at one time 
voiced disdain for Jordan's very existence, confirmed in the king's mind the 
need to look elsewhere for protection. 
</P>
<P>
Brimming with confidence following the Iran-Iraq war, a million-man army and an 
arsenal of missiles and poison gas, Saddam Hussein was quick to comply. But, of 
course, only on his terms. Namely, Iraq insisted that Jordan help raise the 
Arab-Israeli stakes through such displays of brinkmanship as joint 
Iraqi-Jordanian air force operations and permitting the flight of Iraqi 
reconnaissance planes over the Israeli border. Against his better judgment, 
King Hussein went along with the Iraqi agenda every step of the way as the 
price to pay for the right to brandish the Iraqi army as Jordan's strategic 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Jordan sought comfort in the smug belief that it had the 
relationship well under control. For the past year, as Iraq's relations with 
the West worsened, Amman has seen itself performing la mission civilatrice in 
its relations with Baghdad, with Jordanians officials speaking expansively of 
the invaluable role they play in explaining the West to Iraq and explaining 
Iraq to the West. The king, it was implied, was a royal Higgins to Saddam's 
Eliza Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi digestion of Kuwait, a hereditary monarchy with roots in its land 
almost two centuries longer than the Hashemites in theirs, showed how 
ridiculous and misguided Jordanian policy actually was. Jordan has no leverage 
over Iraq and has not had any since the end of the Iran-Iraq war, but Jordan 
refused to see the one-way signs posted on the road to Baghdad. By promising a 
peaceful resolution in the gulf, the Iraqi president lied and abused 
theJordanian king -- his closest and perhaps his only ally -- and underscored 
Jordan's utter lack of strategic independence. The king's reaction so far is 
the response of a proud but powerless man made to look the fool. 
</P>
<P>
A final reason for the king's apologia for Iraq revolves around domestic 
political opinion in Jordan. He is not, as has been suggested, Mussolini to 
Saddam's Hitler; Jordan has neither the means nor the ambition for territorial 
expansion. But the World War II analogy that does apply is the Austrian-like 
reaction of the Jordanian and Palestinian people to the Iraqi Anschluss. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of unprecedented international condemnation, the Jordanians and 
Palestinians continue to lionize Saddam Hussein for taking what he believes is 
rightfully his. That is a lesson many in their hearts (if not in their minds) 
would like to see applied in Palestine as well as in Jordan itself. As he has 
done on occasion in the past, King Hussein has decided to ride that tide, 
rather than be swept up in it. 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the West's favorite Arab ruler quixotically finds himself in 
league with Moammar Kadafi and Yasser Arafat in excusing Iraq's lust and 
avarice. Sadly, though, even this appeasing posture will not deter Saddam 
Hussein from sacrificing the Hashemite monarchy to take the battle directly to 
Israel.

WHILE THE ATHLETICS KEEP MOVING TOWARD A TITLE, RED SOX FIND TROUBLE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics are marching resolutely to the American League West 
title, but the Boston Red Sox may be in trouble in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson held the Red Sox to three hits and pitched his first shutout 
with the Athletics in a 4-0 victory over the Red Sox at Oakland Monday night, 
stretching their lead to six games over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But the loss that cut Boston's lead over Toronto to two games wasn't the big 
worry for the Red Sox. The possible loss for an indefinite period of their 
offensive leader, Wade Boggs, was. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs chipped a bone on the middle toe on his right foot when he fouled a pitch 
Sunday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs missed the opener of the three-game series with the A's. His status is 
being called day to day, but a prolonged absence might be too much for the Red 
Sox, who have trouble scoring runs when Boggs isn't playing. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, who has been a solid starter for the Athletics, improved his record 
to 12-7. He is assured of his best record since 1980 when he was 16-11 for 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Until his first two starts this month, Sanderson had gone at least five innings 
in all 22 starts, however, it was his first shutout since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In five of his defeats, including Nolan Ryan's no-hitter, the Athletics scored 
a total of two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hassey and Dave Henderson drove in runs in the second inning for the A's 
and Doug Jennings, in the lineup while Jose Canseco rests his aching back, 
homered for the third Oakland run. It was his first home run since April 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford had two hits for Oakland. He is 11 for 16 in the last four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 3, Seattle 2 -- Rookie sensation Ben McDonald needed help at Seattle, 
but he picked up his fifth victory in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald had a three-hitter through eight, but he was in trouble in the ninth. 
Gregg Olson gave up a run-scoring single to Edgar Martinez, but got the last 
out for his 27th save. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, 22, who relieved six times before he made a start, has a 5-0 record 
and a 1.56 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken had two hits, drove in a run and scored once for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Chicago 3 -- The White Sox's talented rookie, Alex Fernandez, 
celebrated his 21st birthday with another strong outing at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez gave up five hits and an unearned run in eight innings. When the 
White Sox scored twice in the bottom of the eighth, another win seemed assured. 
</P>
<P>
But Bobby Thigpen failed to protect a lead for only the sixth time in 43 
opportunities. Junior Felix's run-scoring single climaxed a three-run rally in 
the ninth that won it for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Johnson had the big hit in the eighth for the White Sox. His triple drove 
in the tie-breaking run and he scored the other. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three starts that the Chicago bullpen failed to save 
a win for Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Cleveland 5 -- Cecil Fielder was fooled by Jeff Shaw's pitch in the 
first inning at Cleveland, but he got enough of it to send it just over the 
right-field fence for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder's major league leading 36th home run helped Walt Terrell win his first 
game since rejoining the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, who had his best seasons in Detroit before being traded to San Diego 
after the 1988 season, went six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Texas 3 -- The defeat wasn't the worst thing that happened to 
the Rangers at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brown, a 12-game winner, had to leave the game in the second inning 
because of a hyperextended right elbow. He was sent home for further tests. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Perry, batting .466 in the last 10 games, led the Royals' offense. He 
had three hits, scored two runs and drove in two. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Appier (8-4), one of the Royals' best young pitchers, went 6 2/3 innings 
for the win. The Royals, who climbed out of the cellar in the West a couple of 
weeks ago, are now only three games behind third-place Texas. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
REDS REGAIN COMPOSURE, TAKE GAME AND SERIES FROM GIANTS 
</P>

<P>
When the San Francisco Giants arrived for an important four-game series at 
Cincinnati, the Reds were on the verge of losing their composure. 
</P>
<P>
They had won only four of their previous 17 games and had blown most of a 14 
1/2-game lead over the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
But Giant Manager Roger Craig almost overnight changed the Reds into an angry, 
confident team ready to defend its lead in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up four runs to the Giants in the first inning, three of them on 
Matt Williams' home run, the Reds came back to win, 6-5, to take the series, 
3-1, and stretch their lead to 6 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Craig incurred the wrath of Manager Lou Piniella when he accused pitcher Norm 
Charlton of throwing a spitter, and then upset relief pitcher Ron Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost a couple of games and they accuse our pitchers of spitters," 
Piniella said. "They can't accept we beat them. He (Craig) got us stirred up. 
He did us a favor." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Oliver's two-run double highlighted the five-run fourth that brought the 
Reds from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 7, Chicago 2 -- Franklin Stubbs broke out of a one for 27 slump with 
two home runs to lead the Astros to just their 15th win in 55 road games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' 20-year-old rookie, Lance Dickson, lost his second major league 
start. It was only the Cubs' eighth loss in 27 games. DAN HAFNER

Wide Bodies: Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) says body weight has nothing to 
with fitness of flight attendants and has urged American Airlines to change its 
policy of grounding those it considers chubby. Metzenbaum says American's 
policy is "outdated and wrong," and discriminates against women. "According to 
American's flight attendants, the standard is applied in practice almost 
exclusively to the female attendants," Metzenbaum wrote the airline. "Certainly 
it has no application whatsoever to the pilots, management or executive staff." 
A 5-foot-5-inch attendant may weigh no more than 129 pounds at American.

The Answer: Don't tell the Rev. Tim Snipes you can't make it to services at the 
Farwell, Mich., Church of Christ. For those who say they like to sleep late, he 
provides cots. For those who say the church is too cold, he has blankets. For 
those who complain the building is too hot, he has fans. He also has cotton 
balls for the ears of those who say he's too loud; shrubbery and turf for those 
who would rather worship out-of-doors, and a fish bowl for those who prefer to 
be fishing.

Honorarium: Former President Ronald Reagan says he was "shocked by the uproar" 
over his trip to Japan last year and the $2 million lecture fee he was paid. In 
an interview in the Aug. 12 Parade magazine, he admitted the fee "sounds a 
little out of line." But, he denied he was "cashing in on the presidency," 
pointing out that if he had returned to making movies, he would have commanded 
some "healthy fees."

Listen to Mom: Alleged burglar Jose Cruz, 29, got motherly treatment from Ruth 
Wolko, 84, while police say he was holding her hostage Sunday. Besides cooking 
him a good breakfast, she scolded him to find another line of work, a New York 
City detective said. After 5 1/2 hours, Cruz surrendered, saying, "I'm sorry, 
Ruth," as he was led off to jail.

ART BUCHWALD: FUMING OVER THE RISING COST OF GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raising the price of oil and gasoline in the United States is a serious 
business. While some of it is based on supply and demand, other factors are 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest price-fixers is Nathan Cheesebelt who works in the boiler 
room of Spit-Ball Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason Cheesebelt agreed to see me was because his mother told him he 
had to. 
</P>
<P>
He was at his desk facing a large blackboard, with a telephone against each ear 
and shouting at the people in the room. "We just got word that there is going 
to be a full moon tomorrow. Let's raise super unleaded to $2.90 a gallon." 
</P>
<P>
Someone wrote $2.90 on the blackboard and everyone cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cheesebelt turned to me. "What do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering if you could tell me how you arrive at your prices." 
</P>
<P>
"We do it by crisis. For a long time the price of oil was down, down, down. We 
could get more for Evian water than we could for gasoline. The oil companies 
were starving to death and no one cared. Then came Iraq and we started to live 
again. The threat of a shortage gave us an excuse to send the price soaring." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a rumor that some companies are gouging to take advantage of the 
Middle East conflagration. Any truth to that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Lies, all lies. We're only charging a minimum price to make up for all the 
years we had to eat dog food." The phone rang and Cheesebelt picked it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Right." Then he yelled at the woman standing at the blackboard, "The New York 
Yankees just lost a double-header -- move everything at the pump up another 95 
cents." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you always raise the price of gasoline when the Yankees lose?" 
</P>
<P>
"In an oil crisis you raise it every chance you get. We went up 45 cents 
yesterday because the air-conditioning unit in this basement broke down." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have carte blanche to increase prices as high as you want to?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, but we don't do it willy-nilly. For example, there was a traffic 
jam this morning on the Capital Beltway when a tractor trailer flipped over. We 
didn't increase the prices over that." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we had already raised them after a three-car collision that completely 
stopped everything on the Triborough Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
"At the very time you are raising prices because of events here, you are also 
hiking them depending on what's going on in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all part of the same package," Cheesebelt told me. "Once you have an 
excuse to push up gas prices, you use it. Nobody was sorry for us when we made 
more on the diet cola we sold in our machines than we did on gasoline at the 
pump. Now the oil can is on the other foot, and people are going to be coming 
to us with tin cups and fistfuls of dollars, begging us to fill their tanks." 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of the oil business," I said, "is that one day you're up and the 
next day you're down." 
</P>
<P>
"In a crisis all we do is to provide a product." 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang again. 
</P>
<P>
Cheesebelt shouted, "What did you say? . . . Mayor Barry is going to make a 
videotape for MTV? Right. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He yelled up to the person at the blackboard, "Raise everything on the board 
another dollar."

Eighty-five of the county's A-list hostesses gathered at the Ritz-Carlton hotel 
in Laguna Niguel on Friday for high tea and a fashion show. The party was 
underwritten by the fashion house Chanel in honor of the benefit committee for 
the September gala opening of a Chanel boutique in South Coast Plaza. The Costa 
Mesa store will be the 11th U.S. shop operated by the French clothing empire 
founded by the late Coco Chanel. Of the guests, only a few wrapped themselves 
in Chanel suits and dresses or dropped their lipstick and wallets into one of 
Coco's gold-chain shoulder bags. No problem, said Barbara Cirkva, a Chanel 
senior vice president who spoke briefly to the group before the show. "We just 
view (the party) as something for a lot of likely customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed for Darjeeling 
</P>
<P>
Likely customers included Donna Bunce and Gayle Anderson, co-chairs of next 
month's $300-per-couple store opening, a benefit for Opera Pacific. Asked for 
the name on the label of her smart suit, Anderson emphatically declined. "No, 
no, no, no!" she said, laughing. Translation: not a Chanel. Bunce dropped the 
magic words "classic" and "timeless" regarding Coco's design legacy; as for her 
own non-Chanel party outfit, Bunce dropped to the bottom line. "Chanel is the 
most expense design house in the world," she said. How expensive? Well, Kasia 
Johnson, chairwoman of this year's Opera Ball, was recently checking the goods 
at the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills. "I fell in love with this wonderful 
suit," she said. "It was $12,000." Oh. Anne Badham didn't wear her Chanel, but 
only because she "didn't really think about it." She explained: "I have this 
gorgeous white raw-silk spring suit, but it was in the back of the other 
closet, and I didn't think about digging it out." Peggy Goldwater Clay, in a 
peach-toned pantsuit she called "my catalogue item," allowed as how she liked 
the Chanel makeup and shoulder bags but found the clothes "not for me." Sandy 
Beigel joked that the dress she wore was "from France -- so that's close, 
right?" Michelle Rohe, who spent the social hour chatting with her friend 
Elaine Havelock Heinz, reached into her closet and came out with the real thing 
-- a classic, timeless navy-blue Chanel dress. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
A harpist played during the social hour as the be-hatted tea group mingled and 
sipped Perrier Jouet champagne and Vittel water. Sitting with friends of their 
own choosing (at the place-card-free tables), guests were served finger 
sandwiches, scones, fruit tarts and a selection of teas as Cirkva gave a brief 
speech and leggy models stepped one by one onto a platform set at the front of 
the room.

By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before he became a chiropractor, Stephen Bizal of Newport Beach was -- among 
other things -- a competitive gymnast, a stunt man, even a "human torch," 
diving with his clothing afire into a pool of water for the entertainment of 
amusement park crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerous work, as Bizal can attest from the many injuries he suffered along 
the way, including a fractured pelvis and a head injury that brought on a bout 
of amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
But there's something many of us do every day that can also be hazardous, even 
if it's nowhere near as flamboyant: We sit. And sit. And sit. Working on a 
computer, talking on the phone, taking part in staff meetings, all day every 
day, with hardly any respite except for a trip to the coffee machine now and 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds may never gasp at the sight of a worker hunched over a computer terminal 
but, Bizal says, in one sense that's even more risky than some of the 
spine-tingling stunts he used to do, precisely because we don't consider it so. 
We don't train for it, as athletes do with more obvious physical stresses. Nor 
do most of us compensate for it with other forms of physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend a lot of time being mental creatures," he says. "More and more jobs 
involve computers. We're trying to be more efficient, and we've gone from a 
high-touch to a high-tech society. Most jobs are tied to intellectual 
abilities, not physical ones. And people are getting locked into less and less 
motion on the job." 
</P>
<P>
The more mentally and emotionally stressful the job, the more dangerous 
extended sitting can be, says Bizal, who works at Personalized HealthandFitness 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're under stress," he says, "it causes the muscles of your back to 
tighten up, and that compounds the problem by cutting nerve flow." 
</P>
<P>
In that hunched-over position, muscles cramp, nerves get pinched, lungs are 
unable to expand to full capacity and blood circulation is impeded. It's no 
wonder, he says, that office workers tend to get headaches on the job. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to classic chiropractic cases such as auto accidents or sports 
injuries, Bizal says he's seeing more and more clients suffering chronic 
headaches, backaches and other problems brought on by extended sitting, poor 
posture and lack of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Bizal's interest in fitness to counteract stress goes back to the years before 
he even began his chiropractic studies, when he was a self-styled fitness 
trainer, working primarily with business executives. 
</P>
<P>
For most adults, the trouble probably began long before computers became 
commonplace. We got into the habit of hunching over our desks way back in 
kindergarten, he says, learning to write our ABCs with those big round pencils. 
By the time our sixth-grade teachers started scolding us to "Sit up straight!" 
it was too late for many of us to unlearn that improper posture. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting places three times the stress on the lower back as standing," Bizal 
says. "After you've been sitting a while, as you get tired, you lean forward 
with your head, your shoulders start to round a little bit. Your body does what 
it can to compensate." 
</P>
<P>
Today's children are learning bad posture even faster than their parents 
probably did. "They tend to sit around watching TV, playing video games -- and 
that just adds to the problem," Bizal says. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bodies weren't meant for this," he says. "We're supposed to be physically 
active. Our ancestors were hunters, fishermen, farmers. They used their back 
muscles every day. Now we don't." 
</P>
<P>
Bizal may use the word "we," but he isn't including himself among those who 
don't get enough exercise. He works out at least an hour a day, six to seven 
days a week. "My workout regimen is part of my normal workday," he says. "I 
schedule it in, because it's important." Bizal divides his workout time about 
equally between weightlifting and cardiovascular conditioning on a bicycle or 
treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he's seeing patients, he tries to avoid remaining in the same 
position for too long. When children come to the office, he treats them -- and 
himself -- to a handstand or two, just to make things more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Posture problems can be compounded, Bizal says, by factors such as vision 
problems, ill-fitting shoes, excess weight -- even poor mattress support or 
sleeping in the wrong position. 
</P>
<P>
"Sleeping on your back -- on a firm mattress -- is best for most people, with a 
little orthopedic support for your neck and knees," he says. "You can get into 
a nice neutral position on your side too. But sleeping on your stomach is the 
worst, because you have to torque your head off to the side or you'll 
suffocate. That can leave you in pain the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
The best antidote to the problems caused by extended sitting is, logically 
enough, regular physical activity, Bizal says. Even just getting up and moving 
around from time to time during the day can help to some extent, but it's best 
to have some kind of regular workout. 
</P>
<P>
Working out with weights can give tight, neglected muscles a much-needed 
challenge, he says. And aerobic exercise improves both lung and heart capacity, 
as well as improving circulation in the extremities. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does physical activity counteract the effects of extended sitting, it 
can help relieve job-related stresses, Bizal says, by providing an outlet for 
the aggressions that can build up. 
</P>
<P>
"We're physical creatures," he says. "You can't just think stress away. You've 
got to get up and move around and give your body the chance to do something 
about it."

Rolle Recovering From Injuries: Actress Esther Rolle, whose credits include the 
television series "Good Times" and the movie "Driving Miss Daisy," is in 
serious but stable condition after a car crash that killed a Texas woman. 
</P>

Rolle, 69, was in the intensive care unit at University Medical Center in Las 
Vegas, where she was flown by helicopter after the Sunday afternoon accident 
near the Nevada-California border. She suffered lacerations of the head and 
face, fractured ribs and a bruised heart, said UMC spokesman Dale Pugh. Pugh

AN UNDERGROUND ROCK WAKE FOR THE ZELIG OF HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until his death from a drug overdose earlier this summer, bassist Rob Graves 
(ne Ritter) was the Zelig of Hollywood, popping up in band after band, scene 
after scene. His wake at the Roxy on Sunday was kind of a historical survey of 
L.A. underground rock. It was a strange bill, a lot of disparate music united 
by what wasn't there. The new band of Kid Congo Powers -- who played 
wall-of-sound guitar to Graves' bass in the first and best version of the 
seminal swamp-blues post-punk band Gun Club -- opened with a short, beautiful 
set of distorted, one-chord dirge music. The Nymphs, alternative heavy-rock 
fronted by Inger Nymph, who's smart money to become '91's Axl Rose, played a 
tight set, imbuing even the corniest goth-rock cliches with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
A reunited Thelonious Monster was great, a newly cleaned-up Bob Forrest 
eulogizing his late friend and slamming through the Monster's nuclear-powered 
takes on the genre of American radio pop. The Gun Club's Jeffrey Lee Pierce 
sang a couple of songs with Powers and the Monster rhythm section; the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers (which never had Graves as a member) played a couple of songs 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Then came 45 Grave, the band most identified with Graves, rough and mournful in 
its mock devil metal. Craig Lee and Alice Bag, from the Bags, Graves' punk 
band, did four quick songs. Lee's cheesy guitar sound and Bag's quavering 
vocals still define early L.A. punk, and the audience slammed in glee. 
</P>
<P>
45 Grave finished the evening with a creepy version of "I'm Waiting for the 
Man," the Velvet Underground's hymn to heroin, with singer Dinah Cancer droning 
the words "when the music's over" again and again as Paul Cutler drew fantastic 
windstorm noises from his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
When the song finished, he pulled out a huge knife and executed his wailing 
instrument. JONATHAN GOLD

A WOODY HERMAN EVENING TO REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dancers were ready, the ballroom lights were dimmed, the clarinetist raised 
his horn and wailed his way into the eternal strains of "Blue Flame," the 
band's famous theme. It was deja vu all over again, except for one thing: The 
clarinetist wasn't Woody Herman. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was the Marriott Hotel in Irvine, where a concert and dance was 
staged under the direction of Frank Tiberi, who joined Herman's orchestra in 
1969 and assumed leadership upon the maestro's death in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That this was an evening for remembering rather than innovating was hardly a 
surprise; nor was the fact that the dance floor was often crowded. After all, 
the first date Herman ever played (in 1936, long before any of the present 
sidemen were born) was at a Brooklyn dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
Tiberi learned well during his years with Herman. He has even developed a 
clarinet personality reminiscent of Woody's own thin, reedy sound, although 
most of the time he plays tenor as one of the four sax players who, with 
remarkable fidelity, brought back the special pleasure of Ralph Burns' "Early 
Autumn." 
</P>
<P>
Tiberi also functions as an affable frontman whose comments help make these 
vintage sounds accessible to those for whom "Woodchopper's Ball" and "Apple 
Honey" are perhaps only vaguely familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Like every Herman Herd, this is essentially a young ensemble, one that stays 
together on a year-round basis despite a fair amount of personnel shifting. 
This week, because of transportation costs, there are two local ringers, Frank 
Strazzeri on piano and the drummer Paul Kreibach. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regulars, a seven-man brass team attacked the charts crisply and with 
warm conviction. Outstanding among the soloists was, coincidentally, a native 
son of Irvine, Ron Stout, whose dark, mellow sound enables him to make the 
trumpet seem like a fluegelhorn. Next to him in the horn section was Kye 
Palmer, who distinguished himself in an arrangement of "Body and Soul" that 
managed, with the help of Tiberi's arrangement, to give CPR to the 60-year-old 
ballad. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few unfamiliar charts: "Just in Time" arranged by ex-Basie drummer 
Dennis Mackrel, and Tiberi's reworking of an old Neal Hefti piece, 
"Repetition," during which his tenor solo assumed the role originally taken by 
Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
In the sax section, the three tenor players traded solos with spirit on "Four 
Brothers" and Mike Brignola's brisk baritone achieve a commendable mix of 
rhythmic conviction and melodic creation. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly this is not a band that is about to make history; it is rather the sign 
of a welcome continuum in the story of an orchestra that made its unique impact 
over a span of a half century. Tiberi deserves kudos for the honesty for which 
he is carrying forward the lingering blue flame. LEONARD FEATHER

ZINMAN SEASON FINALE AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The violent ambivalences, schizophrenic moods and emotional high and low tides 
encompassed in Gustav Mahler's Fifth Symphony returned to Hollywood Bowl on 
Sunday night, courtesy of conductor David Zinman and the Orchestra of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the disadvantages the training orchestra faced in such a challenge 
-- essaying the not-unfamiliar work in a venue where major international 
ensembles have played it in recent years, hazarding the vicissitudes of climate 
and humidity, adjusting to yet another new conductor in a short rehearsal 
period -- the strong, fluent reading Zinman elicited from the young players 
emerged genuinely impressive. 
</P>
<P>
It revealed again the American conductor's ability to go to the heart of 
extended works, to express musical structure and integrity while tending to the 
smaller matters of articulation and nuance. 
</P>
<P>
In this long and sometimes apparently sprawling work, which runs a number of 
gamuts simultaneously, the long view, as well as the detailing, is necessary; 
without a calming force to keep all parts functioning together, Mahler's 
conflicting creative impulses can contradict each other manically. 
</P>
<P>
Zinman's steadiness in leading this brilliant band of young musicians proved 
admirable through the length of the work. He did not dampen the vehement 
moments that characterize four of the five movements, but kept them in a 
context of shifting moods. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed climaxes to occur, where they occur, without manipulating or 
overstating them. He encouraged dynamic and expressive specificity in the ebb 
and flow of the orchestral line -- especially in the unexpected waltzes and 
reveries of the Scherzo -- and let natural balances between instrumental choirs 
find their equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of musical breast-beating some virtuoso orchestras produce in this 
piece never took place, though the distances between very loud and very soft 
became as wide as possible in an outdoor setting; true Mahlerian nuance seldom 
happens in Cahuenga Pass. If the youthful orchestra erred, it was in the 
direction of reserve, a certain holding back, a failure of stridency. Still, 
some listeners prefer that kind of reserve. And every solo statement could 
boast a worthy protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-intermission portion of this concert, which marked Zinman's final 
appearance in the Bowl this summer, was devoted to Emanuel Ax's final 
installment in his three-program survey ofBeethoven's piano concertos. 
</P>
<P>
Ax's assured and unflappable playing of the "Emperor" Concerto proved to be not 
the last, or even the penultimate, word on this work, which, in Ax's hands, 
lacks the elegance and authority many others have brought to it. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of Beethoven specialists, the choice of this pianist to play this 
cycle seems odd. If he were colorful, flamboyant or eccentric, that choice, 
even though unsatisfying, might be defensible. As it was, he turned out merely 
undistinguished and unmemorable. A wonderful opportunity was lost.

THE PATHETIC AESTHETIC: MAKING DO WITH WHAT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a world obsessed with aggrandized images of resounding success, "Just 
Pathetic" turns a rather different face forward. A blunt aesthetic of failure, 
embarrassment and thumping degradation is refreshingly proposed for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Decidedly ambitious, "Just Pathetic" looks askance at the very idea of 
ambition. An admittedly fashionable undertaking, it dismisses the utility of 
trends in artistic fashion. Pointedly commercial, it regards with considerable 
skepticism the recent escalation of high-flying commerce in art. 
</P>
<P>
The show is, in other words, conflicted and often frankly confused about 
precisely where its sympathies lie. (I don't know about you, but I can 
certainly recognize the feeling.) Although one could wish for a presentation 
slightly less tentative and rambling, and a bit sharper in certain selections, 
"Just Pathetic" is a low-key gem. 
</P>
<P>
The show means to grapple with a tendency that has turned up in disparate shows 
during the past several seasons, a polemical sifting that few commercial 
galleries bother to undertake. Among the 11 artists are some of the most 
provocative of the moment, including Georg Herold, Mike Kelley and Cady Noland. 
The show even manages to suggest some historical antecedents -- specifically, 
by including the very different work of William Wegman and Chris Burden from 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Just Pathetic" also shines inadvertent, retroactive light on two recent 
artistic events. First, it brings to mind "Thrift Store Paintings," the wild 
exhibition at the Brand Art Library in March featuring amateurs' paintings that 
valiantly strove for, and everywhere failed to attain, even minimal standards 
of mainstream artistic acceptability. Second, it could claim the presence of a 
great monument -- namely, Jonathan Borofsky's extraordinary "Ballerina Clown," 
unveiled in Venice eight months ago. That startlingly successful sculpture 
willingly accepts the socially necessary role of playing the fool in public. 
</P>
<P>
All this may sound rather grand for a show whose most affecting pieces include 
a small bin filled with crumpled beer cans and a rubber chicken, queerly 
suggesting the morning-after clean-up following a particularly unspeakable 
party (Noland); mementos mori for both dead pets and murdered childhood 
innocence (Kelley); fanatical ink drawings (Raymond Pettibon); scatological 
knickknacks (John Miller); and a dirty pair of underwear stretched over a wire 
armature in imitation of a mountain range, but looking like the Mr. Hyde 
version of a Dr. Jekyllesque Noguchi lantern (Herold). 
</P>
<P>
Some individual works recall arte povera (so-called "poor art") of the 1970s, 
but none offers the romantically poetic preciosity of that Italian precedent. 
Most of the chosen artists employ cast-off flotsam, such as David Hammons' 
punctured inner tube, fetishistically decorated with bottle caps folded to look 
like African cowrie shells, or Erwin Wurm's tin cans topped by a dime-store 
figurine. In contrast, Jeffrey Vallance's "The Temptation," a religious 
painting he unsuccessfully tried to donate to the Vatican, is a hapless 
aesthetic cast-off; it hangs its shamed face to the wall, like a misbehaved 
schoolboy. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the show's installation lends an overall air of ineptitude. It tends 
toward the margins of the room, with pieces scattered on the floor, clustered 
in the corners, hung on the door jamb and laid out behind a pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by writer Ralph Rugoff as a send-off for the Rosamund Felsen Gallery, 
which will close at the end of the month and relocate to greatly expanded 
quarters in early October, the show comes with a handsome catalogue whose cover 
is bizarrely eloquent -- an oozing, putrid green "stain" completely obscures 
the title. Rugoff doesn't say so, but the aesthetic he means to champion seems 
to expand on the 1980s strategy of appropriation art. It doesn't appropriate 
the imagery channeled through modern mediums of mass culture, as has been the 
conventional approach for the past decade. Instead, it appropriates the effects 
those mediums have -- the relentless degradation and humiliation, which are, 
paradoxically, essential to the socially and economically successful 
functioning of modern popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this decisive difference, this new aesthetic needs a different name. 
Patheticism, we'll call it. Emphatically populist, Patheticism chronicles the 
mundane, seemingly trivial events of ordinary lives, but it refuses to champion 
a populist ideal. In fact, Pathetic art is adamantly anti-idealistic, because 
mass culture feeds on the propagation of idealized images. Rather than 
envisioning utopias -- yours, mine or theirs -- Patheticism simply makes do 
with what is. And "what is" is frequently a mess. It embraces all those quietly 
horrific feelings one has gone to great if unwitting lengths to repress from 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Patheticism's virtue is in transforming grinding aggravations into small 
pleasures, and small pleasures into big ones. Finally, a worthwhile movement to 
get behind for the 1990s. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Male Animal: "Bruce of Los Angeles" is -- or was; he died in 1974 at age 67 
-- Bruce Dellas, a former Nebraska chemistry teacher who moved to California 
after World War II, taught himself basic techniques of photography and began, 
in the 1950s, to publish a small-format physique magazine called The Male 
Figure. 
</P>
<P>
The engaging show at Jan Kesner Gallery of some three dozen vintage photographs 
by Bruce of Los Angeles is in part a camp display of a forebear of Robert 
Mapplethorpe and, more particularly, of today's fashionable beefcake 
photographers, Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. The pictures' frequently exaggerated 
artifice, deployed in an urge toward sophisticated appeal, is often amusing, 
while little in Weber's or Ritts' current repertoire of "artful" motifs escaped 
Dellas' earlier inventive eye. 
</P>
<P>
The show is also more than camp. Given the harshly repressive era, the decided 
eroticism of such photographs was veiled in a variety of ways. (That Dellas 
felt it necessary to cloud his own identity behind a nom d'artiste is evidence 
enough.) Still, the message came through. The Male Figure, Physique Pictorial 
and other such publications braved the censoring eyes of postal authorities to 
reach eager subscribers around the country and abroad. In fact, they were 
instrumental in first bringing a young British artist named David Hockney to 
the city in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Dellas' basic studio style was standard-issue for the period. But, what compels 
in these pictures is something more strategic than style: Their subtle tensions 
between corporeal exposure and psychological concealment are sweetly poignant. 
</P>
<P>
One principal aim of the pictures was sensuously to expose male flesh, while 
another was to do so without being arrested. Dellas muffles the eroticism 
within an acceptable range of artful guises, many deriving from generic poses 
in antique sculpture, most employing stereotypes of masculinity (athletes, 
cowboys, frontiersmen, wrestlers and -- pun intended -- swordsmen). Tellingly, 
pictorial distance is maintained. Figures are often seen from behind or looking 
away -- backs of heads are prominent -- while only once in the entire show does 
a photographic subject make eye contact with the camera and, by extension, with 
you.

With U.S. Navy ships in place to enforce an undeclared blockade, the economic 
embargo of Iraq is having an "excellent" impact as the United States tries to 
squeeze Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the White House said Monday.

As Administration officials focused on the impact of the sanctions on Iraq, the 
State Department revealed in Washington that about 500 Americans trapped in 
Kuwait by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion have made their way to freedom, despite Iraq's 
continued refusal to permit the departure of Westerners in the occupied 
country.

The U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia appeared to continue at an 
unrelenting pace, with aircraft reportedly arriving at the rate of one every 10 
minutes. Six days after the United States began the large, open-ended Operation 
Desert Shield, an estimated 10,000 American troops are already in position in 
the hostile desert. One soldier said the troops were being told to prepare for 
a stay of four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, meanwhile, ordered Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on a new 
mission to Saudi Arabia to meet with troops there and to confer again with 
Saudi leaders. The Pentagon chief is to leave for the tense region Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's spokesman held firmly to the President's declaration Sunday that no food 
would be permitted into Iraq. The embargo approved by the U.N. Security Council 
last week exempted supplies entering Iraq for "medical or humanitarian 
reasons." It was unclear whether Bush's interpretation of the embargo exceeded 
the intent of the U.N. resolution. 
</P>
<P>
A British source said that members of the U.N. Security Council raised 
questions Monday about whether the Americans "were overstepping the mark with 
the blockade." The source said the council reminded Washington that the 
resolution imposing the embargo did not envision use of military force to 
enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said that U.S. representatives "made clear 
that we do not consider (the U.N. embargo resolution) as an independent legal 
basis for naval interdiction." But the official said the United States has the 
legal authority to act in response to Sunday's request from the ousted emir of 
Kuwait for military help in enforcing the embargo. He said Article 51 of the 
U.N. Charter permits individual and collective acts of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news agency quoted U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar as 
saying that the Security Council did not authorize a blockade, but every 
country has a right to invoke Article 51. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "The purpose of the 
sanctions and the embargo is to put the pinch on them. The purpose is to not 
let supplies go in that allow them to maintain the war machine." But he said 
the embargo does not cover strictly medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"Ships are not arriving; the embargo is being maintained," Fitzwater said, 
announcing that "two or three ships" had turned away and were unable to unload 
cargo bound for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said food shortages have begun 
to affect Baghdad. Nevertheless, she said the situation is not yet so critical 
that food must be sent for "humanitarian reasons." 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said: "If the situation gets like Ethiopia, 
we would allow food to go through. But there are no three-pound people there 
now." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll watch this situation as it goes along. We have obvious humanitarian 
concerns, but we have also very real military concerns," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration continued to avoid using the word "blockade," 
describing its readiness to intercept Iraqi shipping as an "interdiction." A 
declared blockade is considered an act of war under international law. 
</P>
<P>
Although the embargo has shut down shipments of oil from Iraqi and Kuwaiti 
ports, there is a significant amount of oil from both countries that has still 
not reached its destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Energy estimates that about 100 million to 150 million 
barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil is on the high seas, with about 40 million 
barrels destined for the United States. Buyers are free to take delivery as 
long as they paid for at least part of the shipment before Aug. 2, when the 
freeze went into effect, and receive it by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The optimistic reports from the Middle East concerning the blockade led White 
House officials who accompanied Bush on his annual summer vacation here to 
offer an upbeat picture. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has an armada of more than 40 warships in or en route to the 
region, including the carriers Eisenhower, Independence and Saratoga. The 
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy is to set sail Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In all, officials have said that U.S. troop strength in the region could reach 
100,000 within the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the current force "an extremely effective deterrent," Pentagon 
spokesman Pete Williams said: "I think Saddam Hussein would regret a decision 
to invade Saudi Arabia no matter when he carried it out." 
</P>
<P>
But although there has been no military contact between U.S. and Iraqi forces, 
there is also no sign of a peaceful resolution on the horizon. Indeed, 
Fitzwater cautioned that Hussein's troops remain massed on Kuwait's border with 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very close and continue to be threatening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams estimated that Iraqi forces in Kuwait now number about 150,000. He 
added that those troops are "still in a defensive posture" but are 
"consolidating their position." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even as Tutwiler disclosed that 500 Americans had escaped Kuwait, 
Fitzwater made it clear that prospects for freedom of those remaining in the 
occupied land, about 2,500, are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear that any non-official citizens are being allowed to leave," 
the President's spokesman said. "We now have cars lined up at the Saudi border 
. . . unable to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler refused to say how the 500 Americans gained their freedom, although 
they almost certainly crossed the border with Saudi Arabia secretly and in 
small groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There are any number of ways that Americans and other foreign nationals have 
gotten out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 500 and 600 private American citizens also remain in Iraq, Tutwiler 
said, including 27 diplomats and their families. 
</P>
<P>
She also reported that the Iraqi government has said the diplomats and their 
dependents in both countries are free to go and that some of them will do so 
soon. The diplomats have not been harassed in any way, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States does not plan to close either embassy, Tutwiler said. 
Fitzwater portrayed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad as a focal point of ongoing 
U.S. contact with Iraqi authorities. He said that such contacts take place 
hourly. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's announcement that it would facilitate the travel of non-diplomatic 
foreigners who want to leave the country apparently applies only to Africans, 
South Asians and Latin Americans, the State Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said that news reports of the Iraqi claim resulted in a large 
number of Americans traveling to the Saudi Arabian border with the expectation 
that they would be allowed to cross. Citing reports from U.S. diplomats, she 
said between 40 and 50 automobiles filled with Americans were stopped at the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has prompted a shuttling of officials between vacation homes and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who spent a sunny day on the grounds of his 11-acre compound along the 
Atlantic Ocean, plans to return to Washington today for a meeting with senior 
advisers on the budget and other domestic issues. On Wednesday, he has 
scheduled a Pentagon briefing on Middle East developments before returning to 
Maine at midday. 
</P>
<P>
And Baker plans to leave Washington on Thursday for a vacation at his ranch in 
Wyoming. His spokesman said that he would travel with "a full communications 
package" and could return to his office within four hours. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstenzang reported from Kennebunkport and Kempster reported from Washington. 
Staff writers Tom Redburn, Melissa Healy and Don Shannon contributed to this 
report from Washington.

WILDFIRE CREWS PAY A HEAVY PRICE IN HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 80,000 men and women who battle the nation's wildfires have always known 
their lives were endangered by flames or heat or falling debris. 
</P>
<P>
But now, two new studies show they also face an unseen hazard: Their health is 
under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Among the culprits are carbon monoxide, which slows reaction and impairs 
judgment; microscopic particles of carbon that lodge in the lungs; aldehydes 
and acids that irritate air passages, and hydrocarbon-based substances and 
other chemicals that can damage genes and cause cancer, tests show. 
</P>
<P>
Wildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering 
their faces, lose as much as 10% of their lung capacity after one routine 
season, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the 
California Department of Health Services and the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. Combined, the researchers 
tested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and 
after the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Health experts also suspect that exposure to wildfire smoke may accelerate 
aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases 
such as chronic bronchitis or asthma. 
</P>
<P>
"After fires, they cough up black gunk. Then, after a week, they think they're 
back to normal. But our studies show their lungs aren't back to normal," said 
Dr. Robert Harrison, the California health department's chief of occupational 
health surveillance and the physician in charge of one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
"For some of the firefighters, the drop in lung function was rather striking." 
</P>
<P>
The worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals, which can be 
fatal, are given off when fires smolder, the stage in which firefighters spend 
most of their time, said Darold Ward, a U.S. Forest Service chemist. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Linane, who heads a national firefighting crew known as the Hotshots, said 
he has seen wildland firefighters so poisoned by carbon monoxide that they 
can't decide which shoe to tie. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards are particularly acute in Southern California, which is prone to 
more large, smoky fires than anywhere else in the nation. Its four-year drought 
has turned grasslands tinder dry, and its stagnant weather conditions and 
topography can trap smoke for days. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, forestry officials predict that the region's 1990 fire season will 
be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
The Yosemite fires, which have scorched more than 15,000 acres and are still 
out of control, and the recent Santa Barbara and Glendale fires, which 
destroyed nearly 500 homes, are only the largest of hundreds of blazes in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got lots of summer ahead of us and we've already burned 600 or 700 
structures," said Deputy Chief Keith Metcalfe of the state's southern regional 
firefighting crew in Riverside. " . . . Because of the dryness, fires are 
burning more rapidly and more intensely." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 10 years, urban firefighters have known that toxic smoke from 
burning structures and cars greatly increases their chances of cancer and heart 
disease. The bandannas that once were their only protection were replaced by 
air tanks and masks long ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been 
unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light 
enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or 
effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, developing protection for the crews has gotten little attention 
and virtually no state or federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
National fire officials say they cannot get help from Congress unless they can 
prove firefighters are dropping dead. But because no mortality studies have 
been funded, all they have is the old joke heard around the fire camp: Just try 
to find a wildland firefighter still breathing after 60. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crime that we continue to let these guys function like this," said 
James Johnson, director of hazard control projects at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory in Northern California, which is developing respiratory 
gear for its firefighters. "They're a forgotten group, a hidden subset of 
people who have been ignored en masse. In all my 18 years of experience in 
industrial hygiene, I've never seen anything like it.". 
</P>
<P>
In the past, firefighters believed their coughing and congestion were fleeting 
side effects. But the new health studies have documented physiological changes 
in the lungs and airways that do not vanish with the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The Johns Hopkins tests, conducted on 52 Northern California wildland 
firefighters during the 1988 season, showed that their lung function -- or flow 
of oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3% even eight weeks after exposure. 
The researchers said they have not determined if the lungs heal between seasons 
or if the damage accumulates. 
</P>
<P>
The California health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as 
much as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an 
average loss of 4%. 
</P>
<P>
For many firefighters, the lung congestion turns into bronchitis or walking 
pneumonia three times a year, said Linane, 46, who has fought wildfires for 28 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"You take antibiotics and it eventually goes away," Linane said. "But then it 
comes back. And more often." 
</P>
<P>
During the four months of fires in 1988 at Yellowstone National Park, 12,000 
firefighters sought medical aid for respiratory problems, and about 600 needed 
a doctor's care after returning home, a U.S. Forest Service report says. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Stewart, 37, said he knew when he joined the Forest Service at 17 that the 
job was dangerous. But he didn't know he would feel sicker and sicker every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me I look like I've smoked 10 packs of cigarettes a day all my 
life. But I've never smoked," said Stewart, foreman of the Hotshot crew in Los 
Padres National Forest near Ojai. "My lungs are probably shot. I'm a little 
more worried every year." 
</P>
<P>
Health researchers, usually reluctant to interfere in policy decisions, said 
they feel strongly enough about the hazard that they are urging fire officials 
to provide respiratory protection as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not surprised firefighters have decreased lung function. We just wanted 
to document it so the firefighting agencies would take action," said Dr. John 
Balmes, a pulmonary specialist and occupational health expert at UC San 
Francisco who helped with the state's study. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn 
their crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating 
shifts more often to reduce smoke exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word 
has spread to top officials in the state Forestry Department, who say they are 
now starting to search for protection for the agency's 3,500 full-time 
firefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to wait for firefighters to die," said Jack Wiest, the 
department's chief of fire planning and research. "We have to get on this right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution is to develop lightweight and long-lasting respirators. 
</P>
<P>
Air tanks and masks that are standard for fighting structural fires weigh 40 
pounds and last only 15 to 30 minutes, so they are impractical for wildfire 
crews that hike miles carrying as much as 60 pounds of hoses and tools. 
</P>
<P>
Developing technology, however, takes money, and none has been allocated by 
California forestry officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Respiratory protection for wildland firefighters is non-existent. And we're 
looking at a couple of years, at least, before something is developed," Wiest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, researchers from the U.S. Forest Service and Johns Hopkins asked 
Congress to fund a $13.4-million, four-year study to analyze the health threat 
and develop respiratory protection. 
</P>
<P>
But William Sommers, director of forest fire research for the National Wildfire 
Coordinating Group, said national funds are scarce. His group, which includes 
all federal and state agencies involved in wildland firefighting, now gets less 
than half the research money it received 15 to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This year, about $10 million, less than 1% of the federal dollars spent on 
fighting wildland fires, is set aside for research. Sommers said no other 
federal agency devotes that little, especially when jobs are life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
Other hazard-prone occupational groups, such as chemical workers and 
construction crews, are much better protected, he said. Most employers are 
required by federal regulations to provide equipment that protects workers from 
dangerous fumes or other threats. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters themselves -- who traditionally have brandished the attitude that 
if you can't stand the heat, you get out of the fire -- are now demanding 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Their change in attitude came largely as a result of the unforgettable 
California summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In what was called the "Siege of '87," 1,500 fires attacked the Klamath 
National Forest near the California-Oregon border in one month. A strong 
inversion layer settled into the valley, trapping the thick smoke for the 
entire time. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters' union, concerned that crews were falling ill in record 
numbers, asked Johns Hopkins University to send a doctor. Dr. Patrick Ford, 
then a medical resident specializing in occupational health, looked at the 
firefighters' base camp, which was engulfed by a thick fog of black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"We were miserable within hours of arriving. Nose burning, throat burning, eyes 
burning. And it didn't go away," said Ford, now an occupational medicine 
physician for the Navy in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers at the camp, called in to direct traffic, were using 
flashlights at noon because they couldn't see 20 yards in front of them. Ford 
recalled that some of the officers wore gas masks, yet the firefighters wore 
only bandannas. The crews slept in makeshift tents -- cotton sheets strung over 
clotheslines. Because the camp offered no respite from the smoke, the 
firefighters breathed it 24 hours a day for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ford questioned the firefighters about their health and was shocked by how many 
had alarming symptoms. He listened to their chests, and heard wheezing in 
almost every one. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Gregory, 33, the first woman battalion chief at the California 
Department of Forestry, recalls that 11 members on her crew of 15 fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
"You were literally living in the smoke. After a while, you were coughing all 
the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the 1987 fires, Ford and other researchers from Johns Hopkins 
and the California health department mounted studies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old cliche of how you don't put up that traffic signal at a dangerous 
intersection until there's a lot of people killed," Wiest said. 
</P>
<P>
Now 46 and working his 28th fire season, Linane will retire in a few years. 
Looking back, he says, "When the adrenaline's pumping and you're saving 
property and lives and important natural resources, it seems worth it. But when 
I retire and I'm coughing and gagging, it may be another story. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor here recommended that I take full pulmonary tests. I said, 'Yeah, 
yeah, sure.' But I never did it. I'm afraid he'll tell me there's really 
something wrong. We're all afraid to do it. None of us wants to know how much 
lung function we've really lost."

</P>

</P>
<P>
HOW POISONS IN SMOKE AFFECT FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
<P>
Wild-land firefighters are exposed to a variety of poisonous substances in the 
smoke they breathe. When forest material or brush catches fire, the incomplete 
combustion turns the harmless vegetation into a barrage of dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The Poisons: 
</P>
<P>
1. Carbon Monoxide -- This invisible odorless gas attacks the brain and nervous 
system of a firefighter, causing temporary disorientation, impaired judgment 
and slower reaction times. It also puts extreme stress on the heart. 
</P>
<P>
2. Inorganic Compounds -- Including lead and sulphur, these materials vary 
widely in smoke, depending on the content of the soil. Lead, found in high 
concentrations in smoke from Southern California wildland fires, can cause 
neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
3. Aldehydes -- These strong irritants, especially acrolein and formaldehyde, 
are found in high concentrations in smoke. They are believed to cause much of 
the wheezing, coughing and eye irritation suffered by wild-land firefighters. 
Many of them are also carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
4. Particulates -- These small pieces of black carbon lodge deep in the lungs, 
possibly causing asthma, chronic bronchitis and cancer. The smallest particles, 
which are the most dangerous to lungs, are found in smoldering fires, where 
firefighters spend most of their time. 
</P>
<P>
5. Ozone -- This potent chemical is formed during fires when there is strong 
sunlight and smoke is trapped by stagnant weather patterns. Human tests show 
ozone, which is also the main ingredient of smog, hampers lung function, while 
animal tests indicate it can cause chronic respiratory disease. 
</P>
<P>
6. Organic Acids -- Including formic acid and acetic acid, these chemicals are 
powerful irritants to the lungs, eyes and throat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Protection: 
</P>
<P>
Bandanna: Wild-land firefighters wear nothing but a thin cloth on their face to 
protect their lungs from smoke. Fire officials say they haven't found 
lightweight respiratory equipment that is effective and safe for the crews, who 
have to trek uphill wearing 60 pounds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment: Standard gear usually includes a hosepack, helmet, goggles, boots 
and a fire-retardant jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Air Purifier: Fire crews at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory wear 1-pound 
air purifiers. The smoky air passes through filters that eliminate tiny soot 
particles that can lodge in lungs. Gases such as carbon monoxide, however, are 
not filtered out. National and state fire officials remain wary of the 
purifiers because they don't provide full protection from smoke. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons: These Compounds, believed to be 
cancer-causing agents, attach to particles of soot in wild-land fires. Experts 
are uncertain whether the compounds cause genetic damage in blood cells.

NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph E. Ceretto has found his dream house. He speaks rapturously of its 
beautiful woodwork, ample basement and fireplace. He notes its proximity to 
parks, baseball diamonds, churches and a major shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
As if all that were not enough, the three-bedroom, ranch-style house is selling 
for about 20% below the prices he would expect to pay elsewhere in Niagara 
Falls. "It's really an excellent home," says the 28-year-old substitute 
teacher, who is single and living with his parents. "I know I'm making a good 
investment, for one, and a good home life, for another." 
</P>
<P>
So where did he find such a gem? In a soon-to-be opened development called 
Black Creek Village -- but better known as the neighborhood around Love Canal, 
the most infamous toxic waste dump in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen years after Love Canal's terrified residents packed up and fled, 
federal and state officials have declared parts of the area habitable again. 
Ceretto is one of hundreds of people who have expressed interest in buying the 
abandoned homes that begin going on sale there Wednesday. Ten homes, ranging in 
price from $48,000 to $81,000 and averaging around 1,100 square feet, are being 
spruced up for the first round of bidding. Planners eventually expect more than 
200 to be put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The quasi-governmental Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency, which is selling 
the properties, has received inquiries from as far away as California. One of 
them came from Joseph W. Dimmitt, an 80-year-old retiree who says he is fed up 
with the smog and congestion of Glendale. "It sounded intriguing. It sounded 
like a little bit of a challenge," Dimmitt says of the idea of moving his 
family to Love Canal. 
</P>
<P>
To Niagara Falls Mayor Michael C. O'Laughlin, who is also the chairman of the 
revitalization agency, the reopening of the area seems like the dawn of a new 
day. That is why he wanted to call it Sunrise Village, instead of naming the 
area for the creek that runs through it. "I wanted to be a little more 
optimistic," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But to a group of environmental and civil rights organizations fighting the 
resettlement, the first sales represent gloomy storm clouds. Rebecca Todd, an 
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, contends that the area is 
still dangerous, and says: "It sends the complete wrong signals to everyone 
involved with hazardous waste issues."

No toxic site is as laden with symbolism as this one, she argues, and if it is 
deemed fit for habitation without proper safeguards, other polluters will 
follow suit, reasoning, "If it's good enough for Love Canal . . ." Her 
organization and several others say they will go to federal and state courts to 
try to block the home sales. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, much of the neighborhood looks like a ghost town, with weeds growing 
through the cracks of its buckled streets and sidewalks. Plywood covers the 
windows of empty houses, and porch lights burn 24 hours a day to discourage the 
vandals who have stripped many of the homes of aluminum siding, copper pipes 
and anything else of value. Vacant churches, silent schoolyards, deserted 
basketball courts give mute testimony that this eerie place was once a typical 
blue-collar suburban community. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered here and there are signs of what life remains -- a painstakingly 
tended garden, a car parked in a driveway, a "beware of dog" sign. These are 
the homes of the 55 or so families who decided to stay, rather than accept the 
government's offer to buy their property. Behind a 10-foot-tall chain link 
fence is the 70-acre grassy mound that entombs the canal itself. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a century before Love Canal became a nation's nightmare, it was one 
man's dream. William T. Love mapped out a "model city" on virgin land near the 
magnificent Niagara Falls. Where grime and factory smoke were the economic 
lifeblood of other industrial cities, this one would have a canal delivering 
clean electricity from the falls. But his plans were doomed by a recession 
around the turn of the century and the development of alternating current, 
which made electricity available even to inland cities. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker Chemical Co. bought the land in 1942, shortly after the city had drained 
the never-completed canal and turned it into a dump. For the next 11 years 
Hooker put 21,800 tons of toxic waste into the canal's seemingly impermeable 
bottom, thought to be an ideal grave. Hooker (later acquired by Los 
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., and now known as Occidental Chemical) 
then sold Love Canal landfill to the growing city for $1. In 1978, long after 
an elementary school was built atop the old canal, neighbors discovered that 
rainwater and development had forced some of these poisons upward into looser 
soil, through which they had migrated into basements, sewers and yards. 
</P>
<P>
Love Canal was the alarm that woke the country to the dangers of toxic chemical 
dumps, and had homeowners everywhere wondering just what might be buried in 
their back yards. It was the first man-made environmental disaster ever 
declared a federal emergency, and the impetus behind the 1980 passage of the 
so-called Superfund law creating a nationwide program for cleaning up hazardous 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Love Canal was also one of the first beneficiaries of that program. All told, 
the federal and state governments spent about a quarter-billion dollars to 
evacuate residents and clean up the area. More than 25,000 cubic yards of 
dioxin-tainted sediment and other materials were taken from sewers and creeks 
and stored on the canal site. Love Canal itself was covered with a 
three-foot-thick clay cap, with monitors installed to detect leakage. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a decade after the dangers at Love Canal were first recognized, New 
York State Health Commissioner David Axelrod declared that four of the seven 
areas near the canal were again habitable, based on the findings of a joint 
federal-state study. In those four areas, soil and air samples tested cleaner 
overall than samples taken from two other parts of Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound a little bit like a joke, but this is one of the cleaner areas of 
Niagara Falls," says James E. Carr, planning director for the Love Canal Area 
Revitalization Agency. 
</P>
<P>
That's hardly reassuring, retort the opponents of the planned resettlement. The 
banks of the Niagara River leading to those falls are carpeted with chemical 
plants, and the county is home to six Superfund clean-up sites, including Love 
Canal. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities "accepted (existing conditions in Niagara Falls) as normal. 
Everyone has studiously avoided saying it is safe," says Todd, the 
environmental group attorney. Indeed, Axelrod himself conceded, upon declaring 
the areas habitable, that "any public health judgment necessarily involved the 
assessment of an inherent level of uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
So what else is new, longtime residents of this city want to know. "All of 
Niagara Falls is nothing but chemicals -- always was," says Warren S. Payne, 
the 69-year-old owner of a floor-covering store. With all but one of his 11 
children grown and out of the house, Payne hopes to turn his business over to 
three of his sons and retire with his wife to Love Canal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be an ideal place -- shady and very pleasant," Payne says. "I 
told them we would be interested in any house that was along the creek that had 
a good-sized lot." 
</P>
<P>
Although Joseph Sibilio bought a home just last year in downtown Niagara Falls, 
he is ready to move again, because he views Love Canal as a step up for 
himself, his wife and his 2-year-old daughter. The assistant service manager of 
a local Toyota dealership, Sibilio took a Sunday drive through the area a while 
ago and spotted several homes that are "the type of house I would like to live 
in, but I couldn't afford in any other part of the city. It would get me in a 
newer house in a better school district." 
</P>
<P>
Sibilio, 40, has confidence that the government cleanup made the area safe 
again -- safer than the rest of the city, where "you can't tell where anything 
is buried." He has even urged his mother to consider moving to Love Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does it seem to worry the homeowners who stayed behind when their neighbors 
fled. "A lot of this is mind over matter," grouses 73-year-old Emma Kelley, as 
she waters the marigolds on her front lawn just a few blocks from the canal. 
The government says her neighborhood is still unfit for habitation, but she 
challenges a visitor to find grass greener than hers or vegetables more 
enticing than the ones she eats from her supposedly contaminated garden. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley grew up in a house just down the street from the neat gray one where she 
lives now. In the 1920s, long before the chemical firm owned Love Canal, she 
bathed in it and learned to swim there. Her father would tie big oil drums to 
her back and set her afloat. In the winter, Love Canal was where she would sled 
and skate. 
</P>
<P>
"My next door neighbor lived to be 102," she says. "The people who had cancer, 
they'd have got it no matter where they lived. That Lois Gibbs -- every time 
you saw her she had a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other." 
</P>
<P>
The name of Lois Gibbs comes into virtually every conversation about Love Canal 
around here. By her account, she was just a housewife concerned about health 
problems that her two small children were experiencing. Michael had epilepsy, 
liver problems, a urinary tract disorder and asthma. His little sister, 
Melissa, was born with a rare blood disease. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told her they were just sickly, but when Niagara Gazette reporter 
Michael H. Brown started writing in 1978 about health problems associated with 
chemicals leaking from under the schoolyard, she began to suspect otherwise. 
First, she tried to have her son transferred to another school; when that did 
not work, she mounted a petition drive to close the school. 
</P>
<P>
As she went door-to-door, Gibbs says, she discovered that many of her neighbors 
had alarming stories of their own: a 13-year-old who had to have a hysterectomy 
for cancer; a 21-year-old whose inexplicable death was likened to sudden infant 
death syndrome; three women on the same block giving birth to babies whose 
skulls did not have the soft spot that permits growth. 
</P>
<P>
Others talked about the foul black mess that would seep through their basement 
walls and up through the ground in their yards, or the terrible fumes that made 
their eyes water. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Lois Gibbs was the general at the head of an angry neighborhood army 
that soon had national attention. Gov. Hugh L. Carey and President Jimmy 
Carter, both facing reelection, acted quickly. Women and small children were 
told to move temporarily from the neighborhood, then the 238 houses on blocks 
around the canal were evacuated and ultimately bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, a larger area containing 792 more homes was evacuated, based 
on the findings of several health studies that are still in dispute. People 
received an average of about $30,000 from the government for their homes. Many 
of these are the houses that now stand to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
All sides have never been able to agree on a single study documenting the 
health effects of chemical leakage from Love Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can they agree on whether the 1980 evacuation of homes outside the "inner 
ring" around Love Canal was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
For Pat Brown, Love Canal is "the nightmare that we live with the rest of our 
lives." From the early 1960s until her family was evacuated in 1978, Brown 
lived just across the street from the canal. 
</P>
<P>
After two miscarriages, Brown gave birth to a daughter who was found, at the 
age of 14 months, to have a cluster of tumors on her knee. Doctors said they 
had never seen anything like it, and her daughter, now 24, still suffers from 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Brown says the mothers of Love Canal panic "every time one of our children 
comes down with a swollen gland, a cough, anything. That fear never goes away."

SURROGATE MOTHER SUES TO KEEP COUPLE'S CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTODY: PREGNANT WOMAN'S CLAIM RAISES PARENTAL RIGHTS QUESTIONS. SHE HAS NO 
GENETIC LINK TO FETUS. 
</P>

<P>
In an unprecedented case that raises new questions about the rights of 
surrogate mothers, an Orange County woman who agreed to carry another couple's 
child filed suit on Monday claiming she should keep the baby even though she 
has no genetic link to it. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by Anna Johnson, the surrogate mother who is seven months 
pregnant, marks the first time in the nation that a judge is being asked to 
decide whether a birth mother has the right to call a child her own when it is 
the product of another couple's sperm and egg. Previous court cases have 
involved contracts in which a surrogate mother's own egg was fertilized through 
artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you donate a sperm and an egg doesn't make you a parent," said 
Richard C. Gilbert, one of Johnson's lawyers. "She is not just a machine, an 
incubator. Where do souls come from? The egg? The sperm? The birth mother? What 
passes through that placenta? Anna is as important a biological parent as any 
other biological donor in this case." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute highlights the wrenching questions that can develop on the cutting 
edges of science. In this case, medical advances gave an infertile couple the 
chance to have a child of their own, by uniting their sperm and egg in a 
laboratory through the process of in-vitro fertilization, and implanting the 
embryo in another woman's uterus. But no law exists to assure the couple that 
they can claim the baby once it is born. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, a licensed vocational nurse and a single mother, agreed in January 
to bear a child for Mark and Cris Calvert, an Orange County couple, for 
$10,000. Now, she says they have breached the contract by making late payments, 
failing to buy life insurance for her, and by not caring adequately for her and 
the fetus. Johnson claims that their actions amount to "fetal neglect," and 
feels she should keep the child. 
</P>
<P>
"This child is not genetically mine, but I have more feelings for him than the 
natural parents do," Johnson said in an interview last week. "If they are 
distant and uncaring now, what are they going to be like when he comes?" 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calvert, 34, an insurance underwriter, and Cris Calvert, 36, a registered 
nurse, reject Johnson's account, saying they have fulfilled all their promises 
and have done more than the contract required to care for Johnson. They claim 
that Johnson has tried to exploit them financially and emotionally, demanding 
payments early and threatening to keep the baby if she did not get the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Her contacts with us have been just a series of demands, complaints and 
misrepresentations," Mark Calvert said in an interview. "We drove her to 
doctor's appointments, gave her money, brought her food, asked how she was 
doing. We did even more than we were required to do." 
</P>
<P>
After the Calverts had complied with Johnson's demands to have two $2,000 
payments made at least a month ahead of schedule, she wrote them a letter on 
July 23 demanding the rest of the $10,000, even though most of it was not due 
until after her October delivery date, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation can go two ways," the letter said. "One, you can pay me the 
entire sum early, or two, you can forget about helping me out, calling it a 
breach of contract, and not get the baby." 
</P>
<P>
The famous Baby M case in New Jersey brought surrogacy to widespread public 
attention in 1986, but that was a case in which the surrogate, Mary Beth 
Whitehead Gould, had her own egg fertilized with the sperm of William Stern, so 
she was genetically the mother of the child. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Supreme Court held that surrogacy contracts are illegal because 
they amount to baby-selling. Custody was awarded to the baby's biological 
father, Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth, but Whitehead Gould was given 
visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
In-vitro fertilization produced the first "test-tube baby" in England in 1978. 
It has only been in the last five or six years that the technology has been 
used in surrogacy arrangements. Most surrogacies are achieved through 
artificial insemination using the surrogate's egg. 
</P>
<P>
Gary N. Skoloff, the lawyer who represented the Sterns, said he doubts Johnson 
will win parental rights to the child in her womb because it was not made from 
her genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she has a much weaker case than Mary Beth Whitehead had, because you 
have that extra step of distance," Skoloff said. "But you have this heavy-duty 
emotional argument of a woman claiming a child she bore. Who knows where it 
will lead?" 
</P>
<P>
Skoloff said the dispute demonstrates the need for national legislation on the 
issue of surrogacy. The Baby M ruling is not binding outside New Jersey, 
because the case was never heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. At least seven 
states have outlawed surrogacy contracts. California is among the states that 
have no law on the issue. Several measures have been introduced in the state 
Legislature to legalize and to criminalize surrogacy contracts, but none has 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he will seek to have the contract declared invalid and illegal 
because it constitutes baby-selling. He also hopes to establish that it takes 
more than genetic material to convey the title of parent. 
</P>
<P>
Christian R. Van Deusen, the attorney for the Calverts, said he will seek to 
enforce the custody rights laid out in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"That child is biologically Cris' and Mark's," he said. "That contract is legal 
and valid. (Johnson) is a physiological parent, no question about it. But the 
genetic parents have more right to the baby than she does. Genetics are the 
property of the parents who provided them." 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen said that regardless of who is deemed to be the baby's parent, 
custody will be awarded by a judge who must determine what is in the best 
interests of the baby. The surrogacy contract allows for that judicial 
decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney H. Joseph Gitlin, who heads the surrogacy committee of the American 
Bar Assn.'s family law section, said he believes that surrogacy contracts must 
be legalized. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reality," he said. "People are going to do it. It's like birth control, 
or abortion. There's a real need. People are desperate to have children." 
</P>
<P>
William W. Handel, an attorney whose Beverly Hills-based Center for Surrogate 
Parenting is the state's leading broker of surrogate agreements, said the 
Johnson dispute points up the need for extensive screening of potential 
surrogates. Painful rifts between the parties are rare, he said, and should not 
be used to argue against surrogacy arrangements, most of which go smoothly and 
benefit everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you ever get something that doesn't hurt someone when change is under 
way?" said Handel, whose standard surrogacy contract was used in the Johnson 
case. "But the benefits far outweigh the risks. This is a real alternative for 
infertile couples."

POLITICS: THE FORMER STATE SENATOR ACCEPTED $20,000 BUT KNEW THE AGENTS WERE 
CONDUCTING A STING OPERATION, HIS ATTORNEY CLAIMS AS THE CORRUPTION TRIAL 
OPENS.

Former Sen. Paul Carpenter took $20,000 from an undercover agent but "laughed 
at" the FBI because he knew they were conducting a sting investigation, 
Carpenter's attorney told jurors Monday as the ex-legislator went to trial on 
political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, attorney Gerard Hinckley acknowledged that Carpenter 
was secretly tape-recorded taking credit for aiding in passage of bogus 
legislation planted by FBI agents. But Hinckley said the veteran lawmaker was 
simply "being a politician" and never did anything to help win passage of the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Carpenter did nothing to help the bill," the attorney said. 
"Unfortunately, on one of the tapes, you'll hear Sen. Carpenter acting like a 
politician. He's taking credit where credit's not due." 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of trial, an eight-woman, four-man jury was sworn in and 
immediately heard opening arguments from both the prosecution and defense and 
testimony from the first prosecution witness, a lobbyist for an organization of 
prison guards. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, now a member of the State Board of Equalization from the Los Angeles 
area, is accused of four counts of racketeering, attempted extortion and 
conspiracy. He is the second elected state official to go to trial in the FBI 
Capitol sting. The first, former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, is serving 6 1/2 years 
in prison after his conviction on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Chris Nuechterlein, in his opening argument, portrayed 
Carpenter as an avaricious public official who used his position to extort 
campaign contributions from vulnerable citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of political corruption, a case where the defendant, Paul 
Carpenter, sold his office to those willing to pay a price," Nuechterlein said. 
"The weapon of extortion in this case was not a gun or a knife. It was the 
power and authority of the defendant's office." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that in five documented cases, Carpenter solicited campaign 
donations from lobbyists or private individuals who went to see him about 
specific legislation. Carpenter refused to talk about legislation with those 
who had not paid money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when an undercover agent posing as an out-of-state businessman offered a 
campaign donation in exchange for help with a bill, he charged, Carpenter 
agreed to aid in passage of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence. During a break in the trial 
after Nuechterlein's argument, the former senator said, "The difference is, we 
have proof." 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley told jurors that Carpenter knew the payment was part of a sting but 
accepted the money anyway. When the bill was taken up on the Senate floor, 
Carpenter did not cast his vote but looked up at where supporters of the bill 
were sitting in the visitors' gallery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked up at the FBI guys and laughed at them," Hinckley said, "and the FBI 
doesn't like to be laughed at." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia) will be called as a defense 
witness to testify that Carpenter told him the bill was part of an FBI sting 
operation long before word of the operation became public, the attorney added.

ASSEMBLY VOTES TO RESTORE $367 MILLION IN SCHOOL CUTS 
</P>

<P>
Turning up the heat on Gov. George Deukmejian and his Republican allies in the 
Legislature, Assembly Democrats on Monday rushed through two bills that would 
restore more than $367 million in education funds cut from the state budget by 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
But while Democrats may be scoring political points with the teachers union and 
with voters who support increased education funding, it appeared that the 
prospect of actually restoring the $367 million was close to zero. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Republicans said Deukmejian is certain to veto the bills if they ever 
reach his desk. They suggested that Monday's action was designed to keep alive 
an issue Democrat Dianne Feinstein hopes to use in her campaign for governor 
against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"This exercise probably has more to do with the gubernatorial campaign than 
anything else," said Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Even Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said the two 
Assembly-passed measures could expect rough treatment in his house. But Roberti 
said he hopes to use the bills, in part, to fashion a compromise with 
Deukmejian on education spending. 
</P>
<P>
It would require a two-thirds vote of each legislative house to override any 
Deukmejian veto. Lacking Assembly support to override the vetoed education 
funding, Democrats placed the money in two Senate measures that required only a 
majority to pass. Both were approved with 42 votes -- one more than needed -- 
and returned to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian last month cut $480 million in education funds when he signed the 
$55.7-billion state budget. The cuts included $12 million for the California 
Assessment Program, a standardized testing program, and $355 million that would 
have given schools a 4.8% cost-of-living increase, rather than the 3% the 
governor had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money Deukmejian cut, which lawmakers at this point are not 
trying to restore, went for a variety of programs, including driver education, 
extra funds for year-round schools and Education Department administrative 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he vetoed the money for the testing program because he wanted 
it funded from the share of the budget the schools automatically receive under 
Proposition 98. In the budget passed by the Legislature, the money for testing 
was considered part of the Education Department's statewide administration and 
therefore did not count against education's guaranteed 42% of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he wanted most of the money he cut from the cost-of-living 
increases to go toward a program to reduce class size. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos), who carried the testing program measure 
on the Assembly floor, said there was no reason to change the way the state has 
paid for the program since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is working," Areias said. "It's cost-effective. It's not broken. 
It doesn't need a fix." 
</P>
<P>
Although the testing program appeared to have bipartisan support, only two 
Republicans voted to restore the money. Others said the funds should come from 
the Proposition 98 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
There was more division over the question of reducing class sizes.

military Establishment on Monday by ordering construction halted on a ballistic 
missile early-warning radar in the Carpathians and the mothballing of 
facilities already built. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow-based Western military attaches had been closely watching the fate of 
the Mukachevo phased-array radar, under construction since 1985 at a cost of at 
least 100 million rubles ($172 million), calling it a barometer of how much 
influence the Soviet Defense Ministry now has in the making of policy. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of residents of the Western Ukraine protested the 
project, saying that they feared the electromagnetic waves the radar would 
generate are hazardous. That argument, plus the logic of improved East-West 
relations and the attention now being given grass-roots sentiments in the 
Soviet Union, evidently carried the day over the military's security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, ordered a halt in construction at 
Mukachevo and even instructed the Defense Ministry, at its own expense, to 
recultivate the forests and farmland that were commandeered for the large-scale 
facility, the official Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, residents of the Carpathians had protested the radar's 
construction, specifically objecting to the radiation risk, a potent argument 
in the Ukraine, where the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident occurred four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In January, regional government authorities joined in the chorus for an end to 
the Mukachevo project. Residents, however, claimed that the Defense Ministry 
only speeded up construction, with work proceeding at the site day and night. 
</P>
<P>
At least 800,000 people living in the verdant, mountainous region near the 
Soviet Union's western frontier signed petitions against the construction of 
the missile tracking station. In response to the groundswell of opposition, 
construction was ordered frozen in April by a government commission headed by 
Yevgeny Velikhov, a Soviet legislator and the chief scientific adviser to 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion rightly feared that while in operation, the station would 
affect surrounding areas with electromagnetic radiation and use large 
quantities of scarce water," Tass said. Velikhov said that his commission 
"could not ignore the opinion of the masters of the land." 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that Monday's decision by the Council of Ministers, along with a 
recent vote by the Ukrainian Parliament to place a five-year moratorium on the 
construction of powerful radar stations in the republic, "is expected to defuse 
the situation in the Carpathian area." 
</P>
<P>
It also shows the attention now being paid to local concerns by Soviet leaders, 
including in the Ukraine, whose legislature recently proclaimed the republic 
"sovereign." Although state-run television said Monday night that Ukrainian 
lawmakers are not in favor of secession from the Soviet Union, shutting down 
the radar project will show residents that Moscow is ready to heed their 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers' decision, however, will not satisfy everyone since, 
as reported by Tass, it stipulates that "installations already in place (at 
Mukachevo) will be mothballed," rather than dismantled outright, as many 
activists had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, acknowledged 
that his government had violated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by building 
a large phased-array radar near the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk that, 
according to Western experts, was similar to the one under construction in the 
Carpathians. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of an Egyptian pyramid," as Shevardnadze put it, the Krasnoyarsk 
radar violated the ABM pact because it was located far from the borders of the 
Soviet Union, unlike the site at Mukachevo.

West Germany's right-wing Republican Party has been registered as a legitimate 
political organization in the East, authorities in East Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Several political and anti-fascist groups had objected to accepting the party 
founded in the early 1980s by a former member of Adolf Hitler's elite Waffen SS 
troops. The party first won seats in West Berlin city elections in January, 
1989, after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform. The East German 
Committee of Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters had opposed recognition.

Pakistan said its armed forces repulsed an attack by Indian troops along the 
cease-fire line that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
India denied the claim. Pakistan's defense ministry said the attack on a remote 
observation post in the Himalayas occurred over the weekend, after talks ended 
between the two countries to ease border tensions. Officials said Indian troops 
used heavy artillery, anti-tank guns and mortars in an attempt to capture an 
outpost in the Kel sector of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.

BARRY PAVES WAY TO RUN FOR D.C. CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CONVICTED MAYOR CHANGES REGISTRATION TO INDEPENDENT AFTER MISSING 
DEMOCRATIC DEADLINE.

<P>
Mayor Marion Barry switched his registration from Democrat to independent 
Monday -- a step that will allow him to run for city office despite missing the 
Democratic Party's filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Barry told reporters that he wanted to "keep my options open," but some 
political advisers said he was paving the way to run for an at-large seat on 
the City Council rather than an unprecedented fourth term as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I still have a significant contribution to make to the city I love," 
said Barry, who was convicted Friday of one misdemeanor drug charge by a jury 
that deadlocked on nine other misdemeanor and three felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
In filing papers with the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics, 
Barry said that his change of affiliation was "not an easy decision" because he 
had been a lifelong Democrat. But the deadline for filing to run as a candidate 
in the Democratic primary election passed during Barry's cocaine and perjury 
trial. Midnight Monday was the filing deadline to run as an independent on the 
Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The former civil rights activist must also collect 3,000 signatures on 
petitions by Aug. 29 to get his name on the ballot, a requirement that his 
aides said would not be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the 54-year-old Barry said that being elected to one of two at-large 
council seats would ensure him an annual salary of about $71,000 over the next 
four years, would protect his government pension and would provide him with a 
continuing political base. He would be the odds-on favorite to win such a race. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech a day after the jury verdict, Barry asked voters to 
forgive him for human weaknesses, adding that it is time for the district to 
heal the wounds caused by racial tensions arising from his 10-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
And he appealed to federal prosecutors to abandon any thoughts of retrying him 
on the 12 unresolved charges. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Department officials sought to distance themselves from any 
decision about a retrial, saying that they would leave the matter solely to the 
discretion of U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the U.S. attorney's call. The attorney general has not been involved in 
the case in any manner, shape or form," department spokesman Dan Eramian told 
reporters.

GULF CRISIS COULD AID EFFORTS TO TIGHTEN GAS MILEAGE RULES

<P>
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait may have plunged the Middle East into its 
worst crisis since the Six Day War of 1967, but the standoff in the sand has 
given a boost to lawmakers and environmentalists concerned over the threat of 
global climate warming. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, activists had been trying, without much success, to get 
the Bush Administration to seek dramatic reductions in America's output of 
carbon dioxide, the "greenhouse gas" principally responsible for trapping the 
sun's heat. The government had rebuffed their appeals on grounds that it needed 
more information -- both on the evidence of accelerated warming and the cost of 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
But with the threat of a drop in world oil supplies as a result of the loss of 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the U.S. may now come face to face with the need to 
conserve fuel. The Gulf crisis may generate support for making cars more 
efficient, a potentially huge step toward reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
"Increased fuel efficiency," said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, "is the 
single most important contribution we can now make toward combatting global 
warming." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pending Legislation 
</P>
<P>
A bill pending in the Senate would require automobile manufacturers to produce, 
by the turn of the century, vehicles that average up to 45 miles per gallon of 
gasoline, compared to an average of 18 m.p.g. for all cars now on the road and 
27.5 m.p.g. for new cars sold this year. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the United States pumps 1.25 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. Nearly a third of this comes from motor vehicles. Another third 
comes from the burning of coal, oil and gas to produce electricity. The rest is 
from miscellaneous other industrial sources. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.), chief sponsor of the fuel efficiency measure 
expected to be put before the Senate in the fall, says it would result in 
carbon dioxide emissions being reduced by 485 million tons in the first six 
years. Over the lifetime of automobiles manufactured in 1995, it would save 9.1 
billion gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
When the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved its 
sweeping modernization of clean air laws earlier this year, it included a 
requirement for a 40-m.p.g. average for cars by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure was adamantly opposed by the Bush Administration. In closed 
negotiations arranged to save the package from a veto, Senate leaders agreed to 
drop the auto efficiency rule. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) promised Bryan that it would be put to a vote as a separate bill later 
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan's bill would require a 20% improvement in fuel efficiency by the 1995 
model year, and fleet averages of 40 m.p.g. for the 2001 model year. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, meanwhile, Rep. Claudine Schneider (R-R.I) included a 45-m.p.g. 
requirement in an omnibus global-warming bill. After that bill was referred to 
11 House committees for consideration, Schneider and Rep. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Greenbrae) introduced a separate fuel efficiency measure, now before the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, to raise the fleet average figure to 45 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Outlook 
</P>
<P>
"The climate," said Bryan, "is much improved for favorable action. Once again a 
crisis has pointed up our vulnerability, and people are asking how we got into 
this again so soon." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, industry opposition confronts the bill with an uphill 
fight, even though it addresses both global warming and energy independence. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, environmental groups are launching campaigns in support of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are being held hostage by both Iraq and Detroit," the Sierra 
Club's Becker said.

Paula Austin said she had a fitting punishment for Massachusetts politicians 
who have presided over the state's recent fiscal turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, they can take every one out and guillotine them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Austin's comment is a familiar one these days in Massachusetts, where public 
anger at state government, fed by two years of fiscal chaos, is raging nearly 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The anger mounted in recent months as lawmakers struggled without success to 
reach agreement on a plan to wipe out existing and projected budget deficits. 
It intensified in July, when lawmakers enacted the largest tax hike in the 
state's history -- including an extension of the sales tax to nearly 600 
services -- and then approved a budget many contend is out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the turmoil has been to build momentum for a Nov. 6 ballot 
initiative that would repeal all state tax and fee hikes enacted since July, 
1988. It would also lower the income tax for 24 months to reimburse taxpayers 
for a temporary increase adopted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Many see the debate over Question 3, the petition sponsored by Citizens for 
Limited Taxation, as a rematch of the fight in 1980 over the citizen group's 
ballot plan to limit local property taxes, which won voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
The battle lines this year closely resemble 1980, with a patchwork coalition of 
labor unions, municipal officials and human service advocates lining up against 
the petition, and Citizens for Limited Taxation, the Massachusetts High 
Technology Council and a few business groups in support. 
</P>
<P>
As in 1980, both sides are portraying the stakes as high. Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis has warned that passage of the rollback would be devastating to state 
and local services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that is so inconceivable in its destructiveness that 
you have to believe (that) by November people will have come to their senses," 
former U.S. Sen. Paul E. Tsongas said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say that passage of the initiative will mean the loss of $1.14 
billion in tax revenues for the fiscal year ending July, 1991, and $2.1 billion 
the next year. About $220 million or so in fees charged by various state 
agencies also would be lost this year. 
</P>
<P>
James Braude, director of the Campaign for Massachusetts' Future, the coalition 
opposing the petition, said that, if it passes, it will result in a 31% cut in 
non-mandatory spending in the first six months of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"That's unconscionable," he said, predicting devastation to programs that serve 
needy people. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said the petition would also wreak havoc on an economy already in 
recession by halting major job-producing construction projects and further 
reducing the state's bond rating, already the lowest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters say the ballot question is the public's last chance to put an 
end to the state's runaway spending habits and the recurrent tax hikes needed 
to support them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're doing is sidestepping the state Legislature and governor to 
correct a problem they won't address," said Francis J. Faulkner, associate 
director of Citizens for Limited Taxation. 
</P>
<P>
Howard P. Foley, president of the high tech council, said that, even after the 
spending cuts required by the petition, state spending will have risen by 85% 
over seven years. "I think most people would say that should be sufficient," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although not strictly a partisan issue, the rollback debate could dominate this 
year's gubernatorial race, especially if Boston University President John R. 
Silber wins the Democratic nomination. Although he is the most conservative of 
the three Democrats in the race, Silber has been most outspoken in denouncing 
the citizen group's plan. The two Republican candidates support it. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the task facing petition opponents is daunting, although not 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Watanabe, chairman of the political science department of the University 
of Massachusetts at Boston, said opponents must articulate to the public "the 
real costs" of the petition. 
</P>
<P>
But voters like Tom Quincy say they have already decided to vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe then they'll spend the money in the right way," he said of state 
officials.

JORDAN SHIFTS CLOSER TO IRAQ, DENOUNCES WESTERN PRESENCE; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: KING HUSSEIN'S STANCE IS SURE TO PUT HIS NATION IN CONFLICT WITH THE 
UNITED STATES.

<TEXT>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, long identified as a cautious friend of the West, 
appears to have aligned his country firmly behind Iraq with a speech accusing 
foreigners of trying to colonize the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
The king told Parliament on Sunday that "the industrialized nations are 
determined to reshape the map of our region, which contains two-thirds of the 
world's oil, in a manner that would only serve their own interests." His 
remarks were not made public until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein made no specific mention of the United States, but clearly his remarks 
were prompted by the Bush Administration's decision to send troops to Saudi 
Arabia to discourage Iraq from invading. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign ambitions in this region serve the purposes of the enemies of the Arab 
nation and are designed to help achieve the enemy's objectives through 
depriving the Arabs of their wealth now and in the future," he warned. "The 
present explosive situation is threatening the whole region and resulted from 
the massing of foreign military forces on Arab soil." 
</P>
<P>
The position taken by the king is sure to put Jordan in conflict with the 
United States, which is applying economic sanctions to Iraq. On Monday, Rep. 
Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) was in Jordan trying to convince Hussein of the need 
for sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Solarz told reporters: "We have to make it clear that the whole relationship 
with the United States hinges on making the sanctions work. Given the interests 
we have in the gulf, we would not be prepared to maintain relations as they are 
if Jordan seemed to be subverting sanctions designed to bring Iraq's aggression 
to an end." 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hussein appeared to be preparing Jordanians for the possibility 
that their country will suffer economically, or worse, for failing to halt 
trade with Iraq as demanded by a resolution of the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
"A change of consumption habits has become a must under these circumstances," 
he said, "and we have to persuade everybody to follow this course." 
</P>
<P>
The king, who has been in power for 37 years, ordered the government to plan 
for civil defense training and to set up first-aid clinics throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in an apparent effort to lessen anti-American feelings, he urged his 
citizens to treat foreigners with respect. He said it is "important to keep 
foreigners as friends supporting our causes through our generosity." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Hussein had trod more gingerly, saying that his reluctance to 
criticize Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was due to his effort to be a neutral 
arbitrator. The unusually blunt language on Sunday came after a series of 
official expressions lamenting the failure of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, whose kingdom was carved out by colonial rulers after World War II, 
has long been considered the most moderate of Arab leaders in his relations 
with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Relations with Washington became strained after he pulled out of diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 1988. Hussein gave up 
Jordan's claim to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, leaving the 
field to the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Washington's tone toward Hussein grew markedly cooler, and the 
level of U.S. aid declined. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats in Amman, the United States thought it could 
nudge Jordan into dealing again with the Palestinian issue -- and eventually 
with Israel -- by giving Hussein a cold shoulder. But Hussein, alarmed by 
right-wing Israeli talk of overthrowing him and setting up a Palestinian state 
in Jordan, looked elsewhere for allies. In Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, he 
found an ally perhaps powerful enough even to neutralize Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But in lining up with the Iraqis, the king has risked not only the displeasure 
of the United States and European countries but also that of the oil-rich 
states that have helped keep Jordan's economy afloat. Also, tens of thousands 
of Palestinians who hold Jordanian citizenship could face expulsion from the 
gulf countries if they are seen as a potential "fifth column." In Kuwait, there 
have been reports that Palestinians working there welcomed the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"King Hussein has almost nowhere to go," a political analyst here said. 
"Suddenly, his only protection is Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan has yet to say whether it will apply the U.N. sanctions fully, if at 
all. Reports have circulated in Amman that Jordan will seek a compromise, 
blocking shipments from its lone port of Aqaba but maintaining bilateral trade 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The logic behind the proposal is that if Jordan does not close Aqaba, Western 
navies will blockade it and perhaps embargo trade with Jordan itself. Giving in 
on this would be accepting an eventual fait accompli. On the other hand, 
Jordanians say, trade with Iraq is so critical to Jordan's economy that it must 
be continued. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 40% of Jordan's agricultural and industrial production is sold to 
Iraq, and Jordan gets about 90% of its oil from Iraq, according to the 
newspaper Jordan Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of sanctions by Jordan against Iraq . . . may not cause major 
damage to the Iraqi economy, but it will devastate the Jordanian economy and 
cause a loss in excess of half a billion dollars per year," the newspaper said 
in an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Solarz was not sympathetic. "Obviously, for sanctions to be effective, 
willingness to implement them on the part of Jordan is an important element," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that if King Hussein decides to defy the United States, he will have 
overwhelming popular support, at least for the time being. The Jordanian 
population, most of which is Palestinian, has been outspoken against U.S. 
policy and for Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait. There are reports that 
thousands of Jordanians have volunteered to fight for Iraq if it is attacked by 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein seems to view his position as enhancing his nationalist image. He 
has told Cabinet members to refer to him not as king but as sarif, a 
designation used by his great-grandfather, who was caretaker of Mecca, the 
holiest site in Islam. 
</P>
<P>
The title is loaded with Arab nationalist significance. Sarif Hussein, the 
great-grandfather, refused to sign an agreement after World War I that turned 
this part of the world into French and British mandates. The title also 
emphasizes the present king's blood relationship to Mohammed, the prophet and 
founder of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
By using the title, King Hussein is able to distance himself from his role as 
monarch, a concept that is under fire by Saddam Hussein. At the same time, he 
puts himself in the position of defending Mecca and Medina, holy sites in Saudi 
Arabia, which has accepted foreign, non-Muslim troops on its soil.

PEACE PROCESS: ARAFAT'S SUPPORT OF THE INVASION ADDS STRAIN TO THE TENUOUS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH WASHINGTON.

<TEXT>
<P>
The burgeoning Persian Gulf confrontation has administered the coup de grace to 
the Bush Administration's already badly damaged effort to bring about peace 
talks between Israel and its Palestinian adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how the current crisis plays itself out, U.S. Middle East diplomacy 
will be changed radically and probably irrevocably. Paradoxically, both Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization may emerge as net losers. 
</P>
<P>
"The peace process was dead in the water anyway," said Samuel L. Lewis, former 
U.S. ambassador to Israel. "These events really have put a strong period after 
the whole (U.S.) effort that has been going on over the last year." 
</P>
<P>
The PLO and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, may have written themselves 
permanently out of the diplomatic script by supporting Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait. The PLO was one of only two members of the Arab League that voted 
against a resolution last weekend condemning Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of Arafat embracing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must have 
gladdened hearts all over Israel because it makes it far more difficult for the 
United States to resume its dialogue with the PLO. The talks were broken off 
last month after the organization refused to condemn an abortive attack on a 
crowded Tel Aviv beach by a PLO splinter group. 
</P>
<P>
But the crisis also will strengthen the bonds between the United States and the 
Arab countries standing with it against Iraq. Washington has long maintained 
cordial relations with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, three moderate Arab 
states that have lined up with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Syria has announced that it will join the anti-Iraq cause, 
possibly improving its long-strained relationship with the United States. Many 
Middle East experts believe that the Administration will come under increasing 
pressure to provide some subtle rewards to its Arab allies by showing more 
sympathy for the Palestinian position. 
</P>
<P>
Most regional experts said that full-scale war is not likely, although it is 
difficult to predict the precise course of the crisis. But they said that the 
impact on the U.S. approach to the Arab-Israel peace process will be much the 
same, no matter what happens, provided there is no war. 
</P>
<P>
"Looked at from the Israeli perspective, the crisis helps Israel in terms of 
its security but poses some problems on the diplomatic front," said Geoffrey 
Kemp, a National Security Council expert on the Middle East during the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, it will be much more difficult for Iraq to get the 
high technology it needs to produce nuclear weapons and advanced missiles," 
said Kemp, now a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International 
Peace. "Even if there is an early and peaceful resolution, there will be a 
tightening of the screws" on military and technological assistance to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Kemp said, Israel's argument that Arab armies are more dangerous than 
Palestinian rock-throwers will take on added credibility. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that once the gulf confrontation ends, there will be an added 
urgency to "get on top of the peace process," something that might require 
Israel to take steps that it has long been reluctant to take, such as 
face-to-face meetings with Palestinian representatives. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Quandt, the National Security Council's Middle East specialist in 
the Carter Administration, said that after the crisis, the Arab regimes that 
supported the United States will expect some rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to do something that gains a bit of credibility with the Arab man 
on the street and gives the pro-Western regimes room to maneuver," Quandt said. 
"When the dust settles on this, the Palestinian-Israeli issue will still be 
there unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, Bush has incurred no debt whatsoever to Israel," Quandt said. "He has 
not talked to (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir, and there has been no 
talk of the strategic relationship. Israel seems irrelevant to this crisis. On 
the other hand, Bush will be somewhat indebted to some of the Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the crisis has put additional strains on the already bankrupt 
relationship between the United States and the PLO. Arafat's support for 
Hussein would seem to preclude any resumption of the U.S.-PLO dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
However, some Administration officials are remarkably tolerant of Arafat's 
position, describing him as a "weather vane" who embraced the Iraqi leader 
because he seemed to be winning and who can be expected to shift his support to 
Egypt or Saudi Arabia if the allied position seems to be prevailing. 
</P>
<P>
One senior official said that Washington's conditions for resuming the dialogue 
with the PLO are unchanged as a result of the crisis. By condemning the Tel 
Aviv raid, the PLO could restore its tattered relationship with the United 
States.

KAIFU DELAYS MIDEAST TRIP TO STUDY GULF MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days before his scheduled departure, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu 
on Monday postponed a trip to five Middle East countries. 
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman said Kaifu will stay in Tokyo and formulate new measures 
that his government will take in connection with the international effort to 
restore peace in the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto, said the trip is being 
put off, probably until early October, so that Kaifu "can take personal charge" 
and firm up "specific contributions as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first official word of Japan committing itself to take measures in 
support of the international effort beyond the sanctions it agreed to impose 
against Iraq and occupied Kuwait on Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamoto mentioned no specific measures that might be considered, nor did 
Makoto Watanabe, director of the Foreign Ministry's Middle East and African 
Affairs Bureau, who briefed foreign reporters. Watanabe said no specific 
requests have been made of Japan. However, some kind of monetary contribution 
is considered likely. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Kaifu decided to postpone the trip because Japan has no specific 
new ideas to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"When we planned the prime minister's trip, we expected it to serve to deepen 
cooperation and friendly relations with the Mideast," Watanabe said. "Since 
then, the situation has changed, and we now feel it is better to visit these 
countries with substantial means to contribute to international peace efforts 
(in hand), rather than just make a visit of a general nature." 
</P>
<P>
Such a visit might have been interpreted as an oil-buying mission, leaders of 
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said. By halting oil imports from Iraq and 
Kuwait, Japan has deprived itself it of 11% of its petroleum supply. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials in Tokyo, the decision to postpone the trip came a 
day after Secretary of Agriculture Clayton K. Yeutter delivered a message 
urging Kaifu to go ahead with it, saying the visit would constitute a gesture 
of moral support for the dispatch of U.S. troops to the Mideast. Yeutter met 
with Kaifu on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Takeo Fukuda is the only Japanese prime minister ever to have visited the 
region. He traveled to Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing Persian Gulf 
countries in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe, asked if Japan might send minesweepers or some other kind of naval 
support, said, "We will examine all possible measures, while strictly observing 
the constitution." Japan's constitution has been interpreted as forbidding 
overseas deployment of troops and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said flatly that Japan will reject the call by 
some U.S. Congress members for a Japanese financial contribution to the 
multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said Nakayama will travel to the five countries that Kaifu had been 
scheduled to visit -- Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Egypt -- to 
explain why Kaifu postponed his trip and listen to any requests the leaders 
might make for additional measures of support. He is expected to leave Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said Kaifu will determine what other measures Japan can take after 
consulting with the United States and other industrial countries and after 
receiving a report from Nakayama when he returns. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has previously made small monetary contributions to international 
peacekeeping or election-monitoring missions in the Mideast, as well as in 
Namibia and Nicaragua.

3 SWIM TO SAFETY ON BEACH 9 HOURS AFTER BOAT SINKS

FALLBROOK, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Jones and two friends were not in a good mood Sunday night as they 
prepared to end a weekend fishing trip off the coast of Mexico. Their quarry, 
Mako sharks, had eluded them all day. 
</P>
<P>
But nine hours later -- after their fishing boat had capsized and the three men 
were forced to swim 8 to 10 miles through dark, frigid waters -- they were 
counting their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 47, of Fallbrook, suffered hypothermia and shock. His friends, Dave 
James, 27, of Oceanside and Paul Hay, 25, of Carlsbad, used shoestrings to tow 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some real heroism there," Jones, a store manager for a medical 
supply company, said as he relaxed at home Monday night. "The Lord was 
definitely looking down on us." 
</P>
<P>
The ordeal began as the men were preparing to leave their fishing spot off 
Ensenada at sunset Sunday. Because a bilge pump in Jones' 21-foot boat had 
malfunctioned earlier, the stern of the vessel had taken on water. With the 
combined weight of all three men standing in the stern, a large wave suddenly 
flooded the listing boat, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'My God, we're sinking,' " Jones said. "I just could not believe 
it. It was a good, strong boat." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his frantic efforts, Jones could not open the compartment where the 
life jackets were stored. Then the boat overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened within 20 to 30 seconds," said Jones, a longtime recreational 
fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
James and Hay took turns diving under a tangle of rope, fishing lines, and 
hooks in an attempt to reach the life-jacket compartment, Hay said. They 
succeeded, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after we got the life jackets, the boat went under," said Hay, a 
plasterer. "All we could see were some faint lights on the shore. It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
The men also managed to salvage and fire off several signal flares, but they 
apparently went unnoticed by people on shore, where some locals were staging a 
fireworks show, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
As they swam toward the lights, the cold water began to take its toll on Jones. 
When he started shivering and could no longer swim, his friends took off their 
shoelaces and tied themselves to his ankles, Hay said. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed like that until we heard the surf," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
But as they approached the rocky shore, the men became separated by the 
pounding breakers. Hay said he yelled Jones' name into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"We had towed him all that way," Hay said. "It would have been a shame to lose 
him that close to shore." 
</P>
<P>
But the group finally made it to the rocks. Hay and James ran to the vacation 
home of Tony Cover of Upland at about 3:30 a.m. Monday. Cover and members of 
his family warmed Jones with hot showers and hot water bottles until he could 
be taken to an Ensenada hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the best people," Hay said of the Covers. "They were super." 
</P>
<P>
At least two of three men had plans to go fishing again. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly," Hay said. "I like to fish. This was just one of those freak 
things." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the ocean," Jones said. "I love fishing."

T. J. MCDERMOTT; TELEVISION PRODUCER, SHOW CREATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas J. McDermott, a co-founder of Four Star Television Inc., which once had 
11 shows in prime time each week, has died of a heart attack at his Santa 
Monica home. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Mahoney, a longtime friend, said the onetime advertising executive whose 
agency, Benton &amp; Bowles Inc., bought more than $5 billion worth of 
television time, was 65 when he died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Creator and/or producer of shows ranging from "Father Knows Best" to the 
daytime serials "The Edge of Night" and "As the World Turns," McDermott once 
was responsible for all network programming for Procter &amp; Gamble and 
General Foods Corp., two of the largest sponsors in broadcasting history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, he left advertising and with Dick Powell, Charles Boyer and David 
Niven formed Four Star Television, an outgrowth of the old Four Star Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
(Ida Lupino had been the fourth member of the Playhouse entertainment team, but 
when the company turned to production the title was retained, although there 
were only three "stars" remaining.) 
</P>
<P>
McDermott, who became president after Powell's death in 1963, helped create or 
produce "Wanted: Dead or Alive," "Zane Grey Theatre," "The Rifleman," "The 
Rogues," "Dante" and "The Big Valley." 
</P>
<P>
After Four Star was sold in 1970 he joined RCA. He left six years later to form 
a production partnership with Jack Wrather for movies and TV films. After 
Wrather's death in 1985 he bought out the Wrather library, which included the 
"Lassie" and "Lone Ranger" series and formed Southbrook Entertainment Corp. It 
was sold in 1987 for $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Anne, a daughter and two sons, who ask donations in 
his name to St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.

DEVELOPER WHO UPROOTED OAKS WILL PLANT 210 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a 25-home subdivision in Fallbrook said Monday he will comply 
with orders from the county's planning staff and plant 210 oaks on an 8-acre 
parcel where 84 mature oaks once stood. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Blakeslee said he's not pleased with the county order because of fear 
that the new trees will die from over-watering, but that he'll do his best to 
ensure that they will grow. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the county in plain enough terms that the trees might die from getting 
too much water," Blakeslee said. "But I'll plant the trees very carefully, in 
areas that won't get excessive water as a result of the normal irrigation 
system for the rest of my plantings. We'll work with the landscape architect to 
place them as well as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Blakeslee's Pala Mesa Oaks subdivision, alongside the Pala Mesa Golf Course, 
has been the focus of complaints since the builder took out, by his own 
admission, 37 mature oaks so that he could make way for new streets and 
building pads. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors have contended that Blakeslee took out as many as 87 oaks, 
virtually denuding the parcel of the very trees the neighborhood treasures and 
which provide the name for his project. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the controversy was a county condition in 1979 that not more than 10 
of the mature coastal live oaks could be removed. That condition, however, was 
somehow dropped -- perhaps in a clerical error -- from paper work in 1980. When 
Blakeslee took over the project a few years ago, he said he had no knowledge of 
the tree-removal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Lauren M. Wasserman, director of the county's Department of Planning and Land 
Use, said his staff's insistence that the new oaks be planted shows his 
office's concern that builders preserve the environment.

"Legally, he was able to remove more than the 10 oak trees because that wasn't 
a current condition on the project," Wasserman acknowledged. "But we think he 
knew of that regulation. We're fairly certain he was aware of that regulation. 
But we just can't prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"At best, giving him the benefit of the doubt, he still showed bad judgment," 
Wasserman said Monday. "He knew those trees were important to the area. He 
showed terrible judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact is, the trees were removed, and we want to fix it the best we can 
under the circumstances," Wasserman said. "Those trees were irreplaceable, and 
the trees we're requiring him to put in are much smaller and will take years to 
equal the size of the ones he took out. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's the best we can expect, to replace the old ones with new ones, 
and to go forward from there." 
</P>
<P>
But Blakeslee insisted Monday, as he has all along, that he was never aware of 
the former limitation. "I've answered that question 10 times," he said. "I did 
not know of any tree-removal limitation, and I still have seen nothing in print 
indicating there was a tree-removal limitation." 
</P>
<P>
Blakeslee said that, since he has agreed to planting new trees as part of his 
site plan approval, he will now move forward with the project. 
</P>
<P>
The builder said he would also provide a performance bond to make sure that the 
new oaks will be maintained for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
The county told him to plant 180 coastal live oaks -- 15 in 36-inch boxes, 15 
in 24-inch boxes and 150 in one-gallon containers -- as well as 30 holly oaks, 
half in 36-inch boxes and half in 24-inch boxes.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA: A CREW OF 38 MEN AND WOMEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH 
AUTHORITY CAMP IN CAMARILLO JOINS THE BATTLE ON THE GROUND.

Four C-130 transport planes loaded with fire retardant flew from Point Mugu to 
a Northern California Air Force base on Monday to be within easy striking 
distance of wildfires in Yosemite National Park and other Northern California 
hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 38-member ground crew from the California Youth Authority camp in 
Camarillo joined more than 2,400 firefighters Monday to battle the fires in 
Yosemite. The Ventura County crew, which included the Youth Authority's first 
all-woman team of firefighters, was pulled off the Tejon fire in southern Kern 
County to bolster forces at Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service, exhausting its supply of private air tankers, called 
for the four C-130 planes. The planes work out of the Channel Islands Air 
National Guard Base, which shares an airstrip with the Naval Air Station at 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The four planes, each equipped to drop 38,000 pounds of red-colored fire 
retardant on a bombing run, had been helping ground crews fight wildfires in 
the Sequoia National Forest near Lake Isabella. 
</P>
<P>
"The hottest fires are farther north, and that is where we need air tankers," 
said Fred Andres, a Forest Service air officer in charge at the Channel Islands 
base. 
</P>
<P>
The four planes moving from Ventura County to Beale Air Force Base near 
Marysville will join four other Air National Guard C-130s fighting fires in 
Northern California. The other planes came in from Charlotte, N.C., and 
Cheyenne, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
"By going to Beale, we can make 15- to 20-minute turnaround times," said Senior 
Master Sgt. Larry C. Mallory, a load master who dumps the chemical mixture of 
ammonia sulfates, phosphates and water out of the rear of a C-130 based at 
Channel Islands. On a good day, he said, his plane with two pilots can make as 
many as 20 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Daniel H. Pemberton, commander of the Channel Islands Air National Guard 
Base, said he expects that his planes will be gone from three to 10 days. Two 
of the planes come from his squadron of 16 transport planes. Two others have 
been on loan to Channel Islands from the Air Force reserves in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Pemberton flew one plane to Beale on Monday that helped haul equipment and 
about 120 military personnel and federal employees to the new air command post 
for the multi-agency firefighting effort. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground in Yosemite, meanwhile, the 38 inmates from the California Youth 
Authority camp in Camarillo set to work alongside other firefighters. Most of 
the young inmates said they had never been to Yosemite before. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking forward to seeing all the big trees," said Juan Galvan, 19, of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a privilege to be out here," said Valarie Richardson, 21, of Pittsburg, 
Calif. "We did crimes, you know what I'm saying? And we get to get out here and 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dale Rodriguez, supervisor of the 14-member all-woman team, said he was 
proud of their performance at Tejon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the toughest assignment they've ever had, and they did excellently," he 
said. "They hiked up a steep hill with loose soil for about 2 1/2 hours and 
they held together. Pretty impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Reese, the California Division of Forestry captain who heads the Youth 
Authority team, said they were equally pleased with the 15 men, who were nearly 
caught by fire from below as it raced up a steep hill. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have help because the radios weren't working," Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura contingent may face even tougher conditions at Yosemite, where they 
have been assigned to the erratic Arch Rock fire on steep terrain at the 
western end of the park. Arch Rock was the largest of the three fires at the 
park on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of warm winds, thunderstorms and lightning, which started the 
two main fires last Tuesday, made fire officials cautious about predicting when 
the blazes might be extinguished. Firefighters had constructed a fire line 
around 39% of the Arch Rock fire by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
John Mincks, forester with the U.S. Forest Service and fire information officer 
at Yosemite, said the Camarillo group is one of several Youth Authority crews 
at the park. He said they are an important part of the firefighting effort. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in as organized crews, regimented and supervised with their own 
equipment," Mincks said. "They are effective firefighters, a valuable 
resource." 
</P>
<P>
Nine supervisors and guards accompanied the Camarillo group. At least one of 
them supervises crew members at all times, even during their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Lee, 18, of Santa Ana said he was eager to trade the hard work for the 
chance to learn a skill and see Yosemite. "I know I would never do something 
like this if I wasn't on the crew," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Lara, a 22-year-old woman from Baldwin Park, said fighting a fire is hard 
work, but it provides a tremendous boost in self-esteem, especially for the 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel good about yourself," she said. "We look little but can really hold 
our own."

3 SURVIVE 9-HOUR SWIM AFTER BOAT SINKS OFF BAJA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Jones and two friends were in poor humor Sunday night as they prepared to 
end a weekend fishing trip to Mexico. Their quarry, the mako shark, had eluded 
them all day. 
</P>
<P>
But nine hours later -- after their boat capsized, forcing them to swim 8 to 10 
miles through dark, chilly water filled with the very creatures that had been 
their prey -- the men were counting their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 47, suffered hypothermia and shock during the ordeal, forcing his 
companions, Dave James, 27, of Oceanside, and Paul Hay, 25, of Carlsbad, to 
pull him to shore using shoestrings jerry-rigged as a tow-ropes. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some real heroism there," Jones, a store manager for a medical 
supply company, said Monday night as he relaxed in his Fallbrook home. "The 
Lord was definitely looking down on us." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the men were preparing to leave their fishing spot off Ensenada at 
dusk Sunday when their ordeal began. They were standing near the stern of the 
Scorpion, Jones' 21-foot power boat. The weight of the trio, combined with a 
malfunctioning bilge pump, forced the boat's stern to ride low in the water. 
When a large wave hit the craft unexpectedly it became swamped. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'My God, we're sinking,' " Jones said. "I just could not believe 
it. It was a good, strong boat." 
</P>
<P>
Despite frantic efforts, Jones was unable to open the compartment in which the 
life jackets were stored. As the boat capsized, it rolled upside down. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened within 20 to 30 seconds," said Jones, a longtime recreational 
fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
James and Hay took turns diving underneath a tangle of rope, fishing lines, and 
hooks in an attempt to reach the life-jacket compartment, Hay said. 
</P>
<P>
They succeeded, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after we got the life jackets, the boat went under," said Hay, a 
plasterer. "All we could see were some faint lights on the shore. It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
The men also managed to salvage and activate several signal flares, but they 
went unnoticed by people on shore, where a fireworks show was being staged, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
As they swam toward the shore, the cold water began to take its toll on Jones. 
</P>
<P>
After he began shivering violently and could no longer swim, his friends took 
off their shoelaces and tied themselves to his ankles, towing Jones toward 
shore feet first, Hay said. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed like that until we heard the surf," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
As they approached the rocky shore, the men were separated by the pounding 
breakers. Hay said he yelled Jones' name into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"We had towed him all that way," Hay said. "It would have been a shame to lose 
him that close to shore." 
</P>
<P>
But the group finally made it up to the rocks, and Hay and James ran for help 
at the vacation home of Tony Cover, an Upland, Calif., resident, about 3:30 
a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cover family warmed Jones with hot showers and hot water bottles until he 
could be taken to an Ensenada hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the best people," Hay said of the Cover family. "They were super." 
</P>
<P>
All three men returned to San Diego County on Monday, and at least two of them 
had plans to go fishing again. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly," Hay said. "I like to fish -- this was just one of those freak 
things." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the ocean," Jones said. "I love fishing."

ANDROS 5A, THE BOMB SQUAD ROBOT, SHOWS WHAT HE'S MADE OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Squat and deceptively awkward-looking, the Andros 5A -- a state-of-the-art 
robot -- rode into Camarillo on Monday to show county law enforcement 
authorities what it can do. 
</P>
<P>
In a demonstration before members of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
bomb squad, the three-foot-tall, remote-controlled robot lurched through a 
range of exercises at the sheriff's shooting range at the Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Andros is the first such robot to be demonstrated in Ventura County, where 
sheriff's officials hope to purchase the model or one similar to it. Bomb 
squads in Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego already have bomb-handling 
robots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In those areas, the robots have proved invaluable in handling 
suspicious-looking devices and have become standard safety equipment for bomb 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said a robot could be put to good use in Ventura County, 
where the bomb squad has responded to more than 40 calls this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a need for one," said Sgt. Tom Convery, a bomb technician. 
"We've picked up lots of live bombs, and any one of them was potentially 
life-threatening. . . . You can work without a robot, but you work at much 
greater danger." 
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, two pipe bombs exploded in Thousand Oaks. One, which 
did $2,500 damage to a car in May, apparently was planted by teen-agers, 
authorities said. The other, left in front of a Domino's Pizza Restaurant, 
shattered a glass door and window. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the bomb squad was called to pick up a device believed to be a pipe 
bomb on Hemlock Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ventura device turned out to be a hoax, the immediate area was 
evacuated. Convery said he donned a 60-pound, $10,000 bomb suit "and had to go 
within inches of the device to attach a line to it and remotely remove it." 
</P>
<P>
"With a robot, you wouldn't have to do that," Convery said. A robot equipped 
with an X-ray device could have detected that the bomb was fake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've run into more live devices this year than in the 11 years I've 
been on the bomb squad unit," Convery said. 
</P>
<P>
The Andros was merely stopping over in Ventura County on its way to the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, where it is scheduled for delivery today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Pat Hunter, a Los Angeles sheriff's spokesman, said the Andros will be 
used to replace another robot "that died on us" of mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
In its Ventura performance, the Andros was put through its paces in a graveled 
clearing by Shawn Farrow, marketing manager for Remotec Inc., the Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., company that built the robot. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind a remote-control panel containing a video monitor with a 
robot's-eye view, Farrow maneuvered the machine's extension arm to pick up 
first a briefcase, and then a two-foot-long metal pipe -- the size of an 
average pipe bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Displaying a delicacy that belied its 600-pound frame, the robot, attached to a 
324-foot-long cable, trundled up a ramp and deposited the pipe in a huge drum 
with explosive-resistant frame. The Andros is capable of climbing most 
staircases, can lift up to 100 pounds and is waterproof. 
</P>
<P>
The versatile robot model has been used by law enforcement agencies in other 
states in hostage and terrorist situations, Farrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year in Kentucky, another Andros -- dubbed "Andy" by law 
enforcement officials in that state -- proved its mettle when a gun-wielding 
youth took his entire school class hostage, Farrow said. The robot was used to 
transport box lunches to hungry hostages, and so unnerved the youth that he 
addressed it as if it were human, Farrow said. 
</P>
<P>
An Andros in New York was shot at, although the gunman missed. 
</P>
<P>
The Andros' basic price tag of about $66,000 can climb to $80,000 or more for a 
fully loaded model, with such accessories as an X-ray unit, a Geiger counter 
and various kinds of hand-like devices for picking up bombs and packages. 
</P>
<P>
Purchasing the robot would be cost-effective, considering that the county 
recently increased the amount paid to the survivors of bomb squad members 
killed on duty from $50,000 to $100,000, Convery said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura County may still be as much as a year away from getting a robot. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Vince France, head of the Sheriff's Department's special services 
division, said it is unlikely that the county could buy a robot before next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, sheriff's officials are still evaluating both the Andros and several 
other models and will choose one of the robots to recommend to the county for 
purchase, France said. So far, the Andros is "heads above" some of its 
competition, France said.

A Camarillo teen-ager was stabbed in the back as he attempted to run from 
several attackers at a party in Thousand Oaks, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old boy was stabbed with a knife during a fight that broke out 
about 9:30 p.m. Saturday between guests and people trying to crash the party in 
the 2700 block of Amber Wood Place, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Coons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two young men tried to enter the party and were refused. They returned with 15 
to 20 others armed with clubs and began chasing the guests, Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, 
where he was treated and released. CAROL WATSON

Two hundred employees were evacuated Monday from a Newbury Park engineering 
company when several acids, mixed together in a container, turned into a toxic 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Fire Department officials said no one was injured in the 11:28 
a.m. incident at Amplica Inc., 905 Lawrence Drive. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fire Department dispatcher Dennis Miller, several gallons of 
nitrogen, hydrochloric and acetic acids -- normally kept together without 
danger -- mysteriously turned into a hazardous gas, setting off an alarm at the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which produces electronic microchip components for the military, 
was shut down. County hazardous-materials crews spent much of the afternoon 
cleaning up the acid. TINA DAUNT

CITY LOANS BRING HOUSES UP TO CODE

When Alice Villa-Gomez moved into her house on Fillmore's 3rd Street in 1982, 
she and her husband planned to fix things little by little. The roof leaked, 
the floors sagged, the plumbing and wiring needed repair, and the house had 
neither heat nor insulation. 
</P>
<P>
But as the couple's five children grew, so did their monthly bills, and the 
family despaired of accomplishing its goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We could see we weren't getting anywhere," Villa-Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, thanks to Fillmore's housing rehabilitation program, which provides 
low-interest loans to bring houses up to health and safety codes, the 
remodeling is scheduled to be complete by October. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be like getting a whole new house," Villa-Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's Redevelopment Agency initiated the program in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Villa-Gomez house in North Fillmore is in one of three target areas that 
include about 500 houses. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Roy Payne said loans of $15,000 at 5% interest are available to 
families of four with a gross income of under $54,250 or couples with incomes 
under $43,000. The city has budgeted $675,000 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients of the loans may also qualify for a grant of up to $5,000 for 
cosmetic improvements, including paint and landscaping, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see people take pride in their neighborhoods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, larger loans have been given and there are a variety of 
repayment schemes, including deferred payment of interest. "We try to tailor it 
to the individual," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
Only six homeowners have applied for funding. Payne said that rehabilitation 
programs are typically slow for the first 18 months, but that the city will

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLITICAL COMMITTEE PAYS $300 FINE UNDER 
PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small Torrance political action committee has paid a $300 city fine for 
failing to file campaign finance reports, but leaders of the group say they 
believe the city clerk should have notified them of the filing rules. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rizzardi, treasurer of the Protect Our Property Committee, said he paid 
the fine last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them we were paying it with great reluctance," Rizzardi said. "We paid 
the $300 because we have not been notified of an appeal process, and, second, 
we don't have the money to hire an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
He said the group is "a small political action committee. We've never had any 
more than $800 or $900 in the treasury." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bill Applegate complained this spring that he could not find 
any city records on Protect Our Property, which had excluded his name from an 
endorsement letter issued during the city March election campaign. The city 
clerk's office, after a review, concluded the group had last filed a report in 
1986.

<P>
The Moorpark Unified School District board will consider today whether to allow 
a teacher representative to the board during all discussions except those 
involving employee relations. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said no school board in Ventura County has a teacher 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Tom Baldwin said the idea was suggested two years ago during an 
unsuccessful recall campaign against him and three others. Charges were made 
that the board was unresponsive to the community and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel the time was right to suggest a teacher representative because 
it would have been too self-serving," Baldwin said. "But I filed the idea away 
and felt this was the time since we now have a two-year contract with the 
teachers union." 
</P>

Larry McDermott, president of the Moorpark Educators Assn., said he backs the 
idea. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: JULIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After residents were warned not to drink tap water contaminated with benzene 
late last week, water officials said the water now being treated by the town's 
filtration system shows no traces of the cancer-causing chemical. 
</P>
<P>
But Harry Seifert, general manager of the Julian Community Services District, 
which distributes the water in the small mountain town, said the water board 
still advises residents to drink bottled water until lab results, which Seifert 
expects to receive today, prove the water in the town's distribution pipes is 
pure. 
</P>
<P>
"The water coming out of the filter is safe, but the water in the distribution 
system may still contain some traces of benzene," Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
The benzene, a component of gasoline, is believed to have leaked from an 
underground gasoline tank. Chevron U.S.A. installed a carbon filter to purify 
the water last fall and has been testing the water for the past year, Seifert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron inspectors discovered the tainted water Wednesday, but, by late 
Saturday afternoon, water and health officials said the water being pumped out 
of the filter was safe. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert said a malfunction in the filtration system allowed the benzene to 
contaminate the water distributed to the district's 500 consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stephany, deputy director of Environmental Health Services for the county, 
said the benzene did not pose "an acute or immediate health hazard."

CSUN COLLEGE PREPARATORY CLASS HITS LOW; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ONLY 52 STUDENTS ATTEND THE FIRST SESSION OF A TWO-WEEK WORKSHOP -- 
THE FEWEST IN ITS 15-YEAR HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As politicians in Washington issue dire warnings about the lackluster state of 
American public education, most students in the San Fernando Valley seem 
content to sit back and enjoy the summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
Only 52 students turned out Monday for the opening session of a college 
preparatory workshop at Cal State Northridge -- the lowest enrollment in the 
program's 15-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids seem to be more interested in earning money to buy things rather than 
getting properly prepared to go to college," workshop director Jody 
Liss-Monteleone said. 
</P>
<P>
"The standards of education are falling," said Ray Johnson, an incoming CSUN 
freshman who hopes to major in Spanish. "I think it's the kids -- the lack of 
care. It's like, 'School? It's a joke.' " 
</P>
<P>
Noting that they face four fiercely competitive years, those students who did 
enroll said the edge the program will give them as freshmen is well worth the 
workshop's $85 tuition and its two-week time commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be prepared for college," incoming CSUN freshman Annie Tu said 
after completing a standardized reading skills exam. "I get really nervous 
taking tests." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting it to be real difficult -- like a slap in the face," said 
incoming Columbia University freshman Gil Lahav, one of the few students in the 
seminar who will not attend CSUN. "There's that incredible urge to go out and 
have fun. So time management seems critical." 
</P>
<P>
But time management is only one of the skills that the three public school 
teachers running the workshop will be discussing over the next two weeks. Other 
lessons include note-taking, rapid reading, writing essays and term papers, and 
using the library. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the workshop's students excelled in high school and simply want to 
perfect their study skills before entering college, Liss-Monteleone said. But 
others need remedial help mastering the most basic academic tasks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
What is "really scary," Liss-Monteleone said, is that fewer and fewer students 
entering college seem concerned with acquiring the rudimentary study skills 
they know they lack. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, students who have attended the workshop in recent years 
seem increasingly dependent on their teachers for educational guidance. 
Liss-Monteleone says the complacency in the classroom reflects a general lack 
of initiative outside school. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids don't want to read," said the guidance counselor at Placerita Junior High 
School in Valencia. "They just want to see the video." 
</P>
<P>
The students enrolled in the CSUN seminar agreed with their teacher's 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Incoming CSUN freshman Isabel Curiel said she was frustrated that public 
schools in the United States are far less rigorous than those in Mexico, where 
she lived until her teens. "I just got kind of angry with the system," said 
Curiel, who said she plans to major in business administration. "A student 
who's graduating knows the same as a student who's entering." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Perry, an incoming CSUN freshman who wants to major in psychology, 
said she expected the CSUN workshop to be valuable for its repetition rather 
than for its innovation. "I basically know what they're saying -- it's common 
sense," she said. "I think the people who are here don't need it as much as 
those who aren't."

PASTORS SEEK PROSECUTOR'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of black San Fernando Valley ministers on Monday called for the 
resignation of a prosecutor who recommended the unusually low bail of $20,000 
for two white Northridge college students accused of murdering a black Pacoima 
pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the $20,000 bail was later revoked, the ministers accused Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Billy Webb of racism for having initially recommended the low bail, and 
called for Webb to resign or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows a lack of respect to the black community and the community in 
general," said Pastor James V. Lyles, president of the Ministers Fellowship of 
the Greater San Fernando Valley, an alliance of pastors from 41 churches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of looking for someone's head on the chopping block," said 
his colleague, the Rev. D.D. Chatman, pastor of the Greater Community Baptist 
Church of Pacoima. "What kind of signal is being sent to individuals when you 
see you can go out and commit murder and get $20,000 bail? What kind of signal 
is sent?" 
</P>
<P>
The pastors made their comments at an informal press conference at the San 
Fernando Courthouse where Webb is the head prosecutor and where Philip J. 
Dimenno and Dana L. Singer on Monday pleaded not guilty to murder in the July 
28 shooting death of Carl White. The pastors had met privately Saturday and 
decided to call for the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
White, 54, the pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church of Pacoima, was shot in 
the back of the head at his Chatsworth home, allegedly during a dispute with 
Dimenno and Singer over a minor traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Court Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson scheduled a preliminary hearing for the 
two men for Sept. 11 in San Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, 18, a pre-business major at Cal State Northridge, and Dimenno, 19, who 
has been accepted at UC Santa Barbara on a scholarship, were arrested on July 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the low bail was set because police and prosecutors thought 
that Singer and Dimenno had no prior criminal records. Both men lived with 
their parents and were considered unlikely to flee or endanger the public, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bail was revoked three days later, after investigators learned that the two 
men had been arrested earlier for carrying a silencer-equipped pistol in a city 
park and might have been involved in credit card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles accused Webb of having violated district attorney's office policy by 
recommending the low bail for the suspects. Murder suspects are typically held 
without bail, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's officials later admitted that it was an error to set the 
bail so low, but denied charges of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Webb refused to comment on the call for his resignation, but Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kenneth Barshop, who is prosecuting Singer and Dimenno, denied that the bail 
decision was based on racism. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea and concept of race had nothing to do with it," Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said Webb did 
not know the race of the victim when he set bail for Singer and Dimenno. 
</P>
<P>
"As I have said previously, there was a mistake made in the matter of bail in 
the case. It was something that was rectified in a matter of hours, and we've 
said all we're going to say on this. There's nothing else to be said," Gibbons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators allege that Dimenno was involved in a minor traffic accident with 
White on the night of July 27. The next day, Dimenno and Singer went to White's 
house to try and persuade him not to file an insurance claim and when White 
refused, he was shot by Singer, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were arrested several days later when they allegedly tried to use 
White's credit card to purchase new tires and rims for a car.

PLANNERS SEEK PUBLIC FUNDS FOR RAIL LINE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE GROUP UNDERESTIMATED RIDERSHIP AND NOW SAYS PRIVATE MONEY 
WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR AN LAX-PALMDALE HIGH-SPEED TRAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The consortium proposing to build a high-speed rail line between Los Angeles 
International Airport and Palmdale, a $1-billion project that was to be 
privately financed, on Monday asked for financial support from Los Angeles 
County because ridership estimates have been reduced by almost half. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a request from the consortium, a panel of the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission recommended consideration of public funding for the 
proposed 69-mile line. One county official said the potential bill could reach 
$100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout came after the project's backers reduced ridership projections 
for the line's first segment -- the 36 miles from LAX to Santa Clarita -- from 
100,000 riders a day to about 55,000, with a corresponding drop in expected 
revenues, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Chiaverini, a spokesman for the consortium, acknowledged that there had 
been a reduction in ridership estimates, although he could not confirm the 
precise numbers. He said he could not explain the reason. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium apparently had earlier overestimated the number of bus riders 
who might make connections with the train, said Linda Bohlinger, director of 
capital planning and programming for the county commission. 
</P>
<P>
The county transportation panel's meeting Monday produced the first public 
indication that the proposed rail line -- which would use futuristic magnetic 
levitation technology to reach speeds up to 100 m.p.h -- might not be entirely 
privately financed. Its backers are seeking approval for the project under an 
experimental state privatization program for transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
However, consortium and county officials said the project could still go 
forward with local public funding, because the state requires only that no 
state or federal funds be used. State officials in mid-September are to choose 
up to four such projects out of eight submitted statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Bohlinger said county officials are willing to consider local funding for the 
project. Based on preliminary projections, the public's obligation could 
approach $100 million a year for up to 15 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bohlinger said the consortium's own projections showed that public funding for 
the line could amount to one-third to one-half of its total operating and 
construction costs for its first 15 years. Only at that point, she said, was 
the line projected to become self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission and our executive director want to portray the message that 
we're looking at this very positively," Bohlinger said. "They're not dismissing 
this out of hand. They're willing to look at the possibility of the commission 
being financially involved." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's Finance and Programming Committee voted 5 to 0 Monday to 
explore public funding options, including possible contributions from the 
commission, the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Department of Airports. 
The full commission is set to consider the issue Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Chiaverini -- a San Francisco-based senior vice president of the Perini Corp. 
of Framingham, Mass., the company leading the consortium proposing the train -- 
confirmed that lowered ridership projections forced the search for possible 
public funding. 
</P>
<P>
Chiaverini said the consortium still is reviewing the line's ridership 
estimates, and thus its estimated finances could change. But he added, "There's 
a strong possibility that it would require some outside assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Bohlinger said one scenario could have the consortium build the line but then 
have the commission take control upon its opening in 1997. The commission and 
other public agencies would pay for the construction and for operating costs 
not covered by fares and revenue from related development. 
</P>
<P>
The commission itself is already $300 million short of the money it needs for 
its 10-year, $9.6-billion rail development program. That includes many other 
projects, including Metro Rail. But Bohlinger said the commission still might 
be able to arrange public funding for the LAX-Palmdale line.

RACIAL MOTIVE IN PALMDALE ATTACK PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: DEPUTIES ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER THE ASSAILANTS WERE ANGERED BY 
TATTOOS OF A SWASTIKA AND THE WORDS 'WHITE PRIDE' ON A MAN'S BACK.

Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating a weekend melee in 
Palmdale in which a group of men beat a man and his girlfriend in front of a 
crowd in a parking lot where teen-agers congregate on weekends, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Houtz, 22, suffered cuts and bruises when he was beaten and kicked by 
about eight men during the attack about 12:30 a.m. Saturday, deputies said. His 
girlfriend, Rebecca Campbell, 21, suffered cuts, bruises and a broken ankle, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age girl in the crowd suffered slight leg injuries when she was struck 
by Campbell's car as Campbell tried to drive away with several assailants 
hitting her and smashing the car windows with a piece of concrete, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Sheriff's Department officials discounted initial reports that some 
in the crowd of about 100 people cheered during the attack, which took place in 
the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant at 20th Street East and Palmdale 
Boulevard after the couple left an adjacent bar. But deputies said no one came 
to the couple's aid and said some onlookers grew angry and chased Campbell 
after her car struck the teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
No one at the scene identified the assailants, who fled, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they are also trying to determine whether there was a racial 
element to the attack. Houtz is white, Campbell is Latina -- Campbell is the 
name of a former husband -- and the eight assailants were black. Deputies said 
they are looking into the possibility that the assailants were angered by 
tattoos depicting a swastika and the words "White Pride" on Houtz's back. 
</P>
<P>
But Sgt. Joseph Fannin said Monday: "Right now there is no indication that the 
incident was racial." 
</P>
<P>
The assailants may have seen the tattoos because Houtz was shirtless when he 
arrived at the bar about two hours earlier and, although he put on a shirt in 
the bar, it was torn off him during the fight, Campbell said in an interview 
Monday. But she and deputies said the men apparently made no racial remarks 
before or during the fight. She said the fight began when several men loitering 
in the parking lot pinched and harassed her as the couple walked to their car. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody hit me in the face and my boyfriend started fighting them," Campbell 
said. "Then we tried to leave and he got pulled out of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tattoos, Campbell said, Houtz is not a racist but has the tattoos 
because he is "proud to be white." 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have any affiliation with a gang or anything . . . I don't think if 
he was racial he would be going out with a Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who did not want her maiden name used, said she is a Chicana who kept 
her married name when she divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell was pulled from the car and beaten before managing to drive away and 
call the sheriff's station from a convenience store as Houtz was beaten in the 
parking lot, deputies said. Deputies sent to the scene found Houtz injured and 
the assailants gone, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, Houtz and the girl struck by Campbell's car were treated at local 
hospitals and released early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot is a weekend gathering spot for teen-agers of all races, and 
violent incidents there are not uncommon, according to deputies and employees 
at neighboring businesses.

HOW THE PET PROJECT OF A MAYOR EVENTUALLY BECAME 'FIDO FOUNTAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local government can be frustrating, and few practitioners of the municipal art 
know that better than Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Geissert spends hours at council meetings listening to angry 
residents berating each other about hillside view obstructions, the roar of 
airplanes or the "Taj Mahal" being built next to someone's basic three-bedroom, 
three-bath tract home. 
</P>
<P>
Among municipal issues, few are more volatile than those involving dogs, whose 
masters take to howling at the slightest hint of further regulation of their 
beloved pets. 
</P>
<P>
But when Dorothy King wrote Torrance City Hall about a canine problem on the 
beach, Geissert saw a chance to get something accomplished -- quickly, cheaply 
and, most unusually, without raising anyone's hackles. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance resident King and her dog take a daily four-mile stroll along the 
beach. Afterward, they sit in Miramar Park, overlooking the ocean. The park has 
a single water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
"People . . . are letting their dogs drink out of this fountain," King 
complained. "The large dogs jump up as their masters turn on the water for 
them. Very upsetting to me, and others, if they knew they were drinking after 
dogs. I myself love my dog . . . but I do not eat or drink after my own dog." 
</P>
<P>
King suggested that the city put in a water fountain at the base of the 
existing fountain. "Something must be done . . . to keep the city of Torrance 
clean health-wise," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounded reasonable to me," the mayor said. "There are not many 
opportunities to serve people that don't cost much money. In rather short 
order, they put in a ground-level basin." 
</P>
<P>
And there, you might think, the tale would end. 
</P>
<P>
Thirsty dogs watered, sensibilities preserved. Problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
But back at the park, beach-goers just did not understand. 
</P>
<P>
King wrote again. "Some people do not use their head. . . . Some people are 
using the dog fountain to wash their feet, and the sand is stopping up the 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
"Dog lovers," she added, "are talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
And that is how the city of Torrance came to erect a miniature headstone at its 
canine watering spot, "Fido Fountain." 
</P>
<P>
Geissert thinks it may be some sort of first. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is another Fido Fountain around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-observant King again wrote: "I have seen many people stop, read this 
sign, walk away with a smile on their face. . . . I am truly grateful."

CHARGERS TO RELEASE FLANNIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
J.J. Flannigan, the Chargers' eighth-round draft choice from Colorado, has 
asked for and will receive his release from the team today. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard said Monday he would grant Flannigan's request 
because it has become clear Flannigan does not figure in the team's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Flannigan, who was switched to wide receiver from running back two weeks ago, 
was disappointed because he did not play in either of the team's two scrimmages 
or their exhibition opener Saturday, a 28-16 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get a chance to play," Flannigan said. "If I get a chance to 
play, I can make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Flannigan, 5-feet-10 and 194 pounds, was drafted as a running back but was 
switched to wide receiver two weeks ago after injuries to Wayne Walker and Troy 
Johnson. But the move came too late to do him much good. 
</P>
<P>
"He was behind; he struggled," Coach Dan Henning said. "He is frustrated and 
disappointed. He wants to be a back, but we didn't feel like he was ready to do 
that. We wish him the best because he has been down and frustrated for the last 
week or so." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the Chargers were interested in Flannigan because of his speed, 
but that his ability as a receiver was limited. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem J.J. had as a wide receiver was his hands," Beathard said. 
"Sometimes that's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a great kid. I would like to see him get a place in the league or the 
Canadian league. Maybe there is a place for him somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Flannigan's agent, Jack Mills of Boulder, Colo., said he would try to find 
another team for Flannigan but so far no teams have expressed an interest. 
</P>
<P>
Flannigan, a Parade All-American at Pomona High School, had an impressive 
career at Colorado, rushing for 1,187 yards as a senior and tying a 54-year-old 
school record by scoring 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You have got an athlete who has all-around athletic ability and they come in 
and they don't fit into a particular spot," Henning said. "Sometimes you are 
fortunate. But more than not they don't work because it is a game of 
specialists." 
</P>
<P>
Flannigan will be the second of the Chargers' 17 draft choices to be released. 
The first was cornerback Keith Collins, a seventh-round pick from Appalachian 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The release of Flannigan will put the Chargers one player under the NFL limit 
of 80 signed players. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he has not talked with the agent for first-round draft choice 
Junior Seau in a week and repeated his position that there is no point in 
renewing talks until Seau significantly reduces his contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
Seau has asked for a four-year contract averaging $1.35 million per year and 
the team has countered with a five-year deal averaging about $850,000 per year, 
according to his agent, Steve Feldman of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are just going to come down another $100,000 a year, they might as 
well not bring it down," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Today will mark the 26th day of Seau's holdout. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard reported some potential progress in talks with linebacker Leslie 
O'Neal, the team's only other contract holdout. He said he has a meeting 
scheduled with O'Neal today and plans to speak Wednesday with O'Neal's agent, 
Marvin Demoff of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We would really like to get him in here this week," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith (bruised thigh) practiced in the morning 
Monday, but sat out the afternoon workout with the Dallas Cowboys. Cornerback 
Gill Byrd (fluid on knee) practiced in both sessions. Both were injured 
slightly in the exhibition opener Saturday against the Cowboys. The teams will 
practice on separate fields at UC San Diego in the morning and combine in the 
afternoon for a joint workout. . . . Offensive guard Mike Simmonds, a Plan B 
free agent from Tampa Bay, practiced for the first time since having 
arthroscopic knee surgery July 26. Inside linebacker Cedric Figaro, who missed 
Saturday's game with a sore ankle, the result of a practice fight Thursday with 
tight end Andy Parker, returned to practice. . . . Rookie quarterback John 
Friesz, who was in for only the final two plays against the Cowboys Saturday, 
will get a longer look against the Rams Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium, 
Coach Dan Henning said.

STEINBRENNER IS BUSY NEAR QUITTING TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As Aug. 20 nears -- the date by which George Steinbrenner must resign as the 
New York Yankees' general partner -- the state of the ballclub remains in 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Developments last week only served to cloud the matter of Steinbrenner's 
removal from the hands-on operation of the Yankees as ordered by Commissioner 
Fay Vincent in his July 30 ruling on the owner's payment of $40,000 to 
professed gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner attempted to have some sanctions imposed by Vincent reworded, 
specifically those with regard to input in financial matters, game attendance 
and re-instatement. No deal, Vincent said. Talk among some major league owners 
indicated the proposed appointment of Steinbrenner's son Hank as the Yankees' 
general partner would have difficulty winning approval. Despite Steinbrenner's 
agreement not to litigate, the possibility of a lawsuit challenging the 
commissioner's authority still looms. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball operation of the Yankees is unsettling amid the corporate unrest 
as Steinbrenner gropes with the idea of naming a new general manager, one with 
marquee value, to whom he can entrust the organization. Meanwhile, Manager 
Stump Merrill is in limbo, awaiting a decision on his status. Steinbrenner may 
be further bogged down as the FBI pursues an investigation into allegations the 
owner used agents in Tampa, Fla., to conduct personal surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Those who thought Yankees intrigue would be a thing of the past after Vincent's 
decision have come to realize George Steinbrenner won't go away quietly. This 
week promises to be busy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite reports to the contrary, Hank Steinbrenner, 33, is expected to be the 
limited partners' approved nominee to replace his father as general partner. A 
vote of the 18 partners is expected to be taken this week, probably Wednesday 
in Cleveland, although a site has not been determined. According to sources, 
George Steinbrenner is said to have the two-thirds approval required for 
passage among the limited partners. He has 55-percent interest in the club. His 
wife, Joan, has 5 percent. Steinbrenner is also believed to have the support of 
Daniel, James and Lester Crown; Harry, Robert and James Nederlander; Edward 
Rosenthal, Marvin Goldklang and Barry Halper, constituting a sufficient total 
to swing the vote to Hank Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Steinbrenner has had no comment on the matter. His silence is 
disturbing and lends credence to reports last week he did not want the job. 
Hank is believed to be uneasy about having to take up permanent residence in 
New York and abandoning his gratifying lifestyle as director of Kinsman Farm, 
the family's thoroughbred-breeding facility in Ocala, Fla. Even if approved by 
the limited partners, Hank Steinbrenner would have to get past the seven-member 
ownership committee's intense screening and then be accepted by a vote of major 
league owners -- a majority in the National League (seven of 12) and 
three-quarters in the American League (10 of the remaining 13). 
</P>
<P>
George may fear some anti-Steinbrenner sentiment among owners could foil Hank's 
opportunity to keep the family involved in a major role with the Yankees. Since 
he must step down in nine days, Steinbrenner is also aware his chance to 
arrange the club's course will soon be lost. Time is too short for a new 
general partner to be in place by Aug. 20, but that date remains the last in 
Steinbrenner's term in that position. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees may be rudderless for some time. Ownership committee chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox has said the matter of voting on a Yankees 
general partner would not be taken up until the owners meet Sept.12-13 in 
Pittsburgh. In the meantime, the Yankees' affairs could be overseen by chief 
operating officer Leonard Kleinman and director of operations Jack Lawn. There 
also is a possibility one of the limited partners -- Goldklang has been 
mentioned -- could serve as an interim general partner. 
</P>
<P>
As for the baseball operation, currently divided between general manager Pete 
Peterson and player personnel director George Bradley, a new face may surface, 
but it probably won't be Tom Seaver's. The former pitcher was reportedly the 
top candidate to take over as general manager, but sources revealed Seaver's 
interview with George Steinbrenner did not go well. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner is said to have one other candidate in mind. Speculation rests on 
former Cardinals Manager Whitey Herzog or Padres general manager Jack McKeon. A 
remote possibility is former New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson or perhaps 
Seattle Mariners general manager Woody Woodward, who had the job with the 
Yankees when Hank Steinbrenner worked for the club in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The main order of baseball business is the continued assessment of the younger 
players in the system who have been on trial much of the season. Third baseman 
Jim Leyritz, first baseman Kevin Maas and outfielder Oscar Azocar have become 
regulars in the lineup. More will be on view come September. Likely to be 
called up are pitchers Dave Eiland, Alan Mills and Mark Leiter, third baseman 
Mike Blowers and outfielder Bam-Bam Meulens. Other possibilities are pitchers 
Steve Adkins and Kevin Mmhat and outfielder Bernie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the ideal time to evaluate our young people," Peterson says. "If you 
don't bring them up now, then you go to spring training next year wondering who 
can help us." 
</P>
<P>
By moving young players onto the roster, the Yankees have to decide the fate of 
veterans in the middle of contracts, such as outfielders Jesse Barfield and Mel 
Hall and designated hitter-first baseman Steve Balboni, any of whom may be used 
as trade bait. The Yankees also must make decisions about whether to re-sign 
players eligible for free agency at season's end, such as pitchers Dave 
Righetti, Tim Leary and Jeff Robinson. Two other pitchers, Dave LaPoint and 
Mike Witt, might be declared free agents as well, pending an arbitrator's 
penalty on the 1987 collusion case. 
</P>
<P>
As for Merrill, he has the support of Peterson and Bradley. If Steinbrenner is 
intent on maintaining a youth movement, Merrill will be retained. Then again, a 
change in general manager may result in a change in the manager's office, too. 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner's last week as the Yankees' engineer could be most taxing.

ROGER MILLA READY TO BE KING OF ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: CAMEROON'S WORLD CUP STAR WANTS TO FINISH HIS CAREER OUTSIDE HIS 
COUNTRY, PREFERABLY IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>

<P>
In the movie "Coming to America," a prince from the make-believe African 
country of Zamunda arrives in Queens to search for his future bride, but first 
finds a job mopping floors in a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Milla came to America this week. He is no prince, although he is treated 
like one in his homeland, the African country of Cameroon, and he does not need 
another bride. He is, however, looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
But don't ask him to mop floors. He prefers work in a field that is not so 
glamorous here and might even pay less. He wants to play professional soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the state of the sport in this country that Milla can't even locate an 
address for a place to send his impressive resume. 
</P>
<P>
While in Paris last week, Milla received a telegram from a man who said that he 
might have a position available in the United States. But the man didn't say 
which league, team or even city he represented. For all Milla knew, it could 
have been outdoor or indoor soccer or even outdoor or indoor American football. 
Perhaps the Detroit Drive needed a placekicker for its championship run. The 
man said he would call later, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging thing about the telegram was that it was sent from Los 
Angeles. As Milla planned to be here for tonight's charity game at the Coliseum 
between all-stars from Mexico and the rest of the world, he hoped the man would 
meet him at the airport Sunday. But on Monday night, Milla was still waiting at 
a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe at tonight's reception, maybe tomorrow," Milla's Paris-based agent, 
Amiel Joseph, said Monday. "But if we don't hear by Wednesday, we're going back 
to Paris and consider our offers." 
</P>
<P>
That could take some time, Joseph said, because there have been so many in the 
last month. In an unmemorable World Cup, Italy's Salvatore Schillaci and Milla 
were the most memorable players. Of Cameroon's Indomitable Lions, he was the 
most indomitable. 
</P>
<P>
Every game Cameroon played was Milla time. Although he wasn't a starter, he 
scored four goals in five games. Two came in the second overtime against 
Colombia to sent the upstart Lions into the quarterfinals against England. 
Cameroon lost to England, 3-2, in overtime, but it was no fault of Milla's. He 
assisted on one goal and drew a foul in the penalty area that led to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Would the Lions have been so indomitable without him? 
</P>
<P>
They almost found out. In 1988, Milla decided that after a formidable career as 
a goal-scoring forward, it was time to make room for younger players by 
retiring from the national team at 36. He took his retirement seriously, going 
to the Reunion Islands near Madagascar to play for the semi-pro St. Pierroise 
team. 
</P>
<P>
But after Cameroon was eliminated in the first round of the African Cup last 
year, soccer fans clamored for their hero, Milla. When he announced in December 
that he was available, they celebrated. Not so pleased were Cameroon's soccer 
officials, who worried that Milla, approaching his 38th birthday, could no 
longer play at the World Cup level. 
</P>
<P>
The more the fans pleaded for Milla's return, the more the officials resisted. 
With his political mandate in jeopardy because of a sagging economy, Cameroon's 
president sided with the people and ordered the officials to invite Milla to a 
pre-World Cup training camp in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Milla said it should not have come as a shock when 
Cameroon upset defending champion Argentina, 1-0, in the opening game. After 
all, he said, Cameroon tied three games, including one against eventual 
champion Italy, in its only previous World Cup in 1982 in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"That was, for us, a big achievement," the French-speaking Milla said through 
an interpreter. "We only confirmed that in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
But, in another breath, he acknowledged that not even the Indomitable Lions 
expected to beat Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as big a surprise for us as it was the rest of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Milla said he believes that Cameroon's success indicates that Africa has 
arrived as a soccer continent. The international football federation apparently 
agrees, because it will allow Africa to send three countries instead of two to 
the 1994 World Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the drop that made the glass overflow," he said, using a French 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
He is as big a booster of Africa as it apparently is of him. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Milla is more popular than ever in Cameroon, Joseph said, "In all of 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
But no matter who encourages him, even if it is the president, Milla said he 
expects to be involved in the 1994 World Cup only as a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
When he retires, he wants to return to Cameroon to start a soccer school. 
Before then, he would like to play for one or two more years. He said he is 
considering offers in England and Austria. Joseph said they also have been 
contacted by teams in Germany, Belgium and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
But Milla said he prefers to play in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play here, to bring to the United States my experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Simply tell him where to apply.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back east, they remember Mike Ditka as a compulsive, all-out football player 
who, at the University of Pittsburgh, sought to refine his blocking skills with 
hits on a padded steel blocking sled. 
</P>
<P>
As an ambitious freshman, Ditka charged the sled ferociously, and knocked 
himself out. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
So they restricted him to practicing against teammates -- but that didn't work. 
He knocked out two or three of them. 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, his coach, Ernie Hefferle, confined Ditka to the bench until 
game day. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about it later, Hefferle said: "When Mike walked on the field, . . . 
everybody was his enemy." 
</P>
<P>
That still appears to be true. As Ditka enters his ninth year as coach of the 
Chicago Bears, he can look back on more disagreements with players, officials, 
owners, fans, coaches and blocking sleds than perhaps anyone else in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
But he hasn't seen anything yet. This, in Chicago, is a different kind of year. 
For the first time since turning the Bears around in the early 1980s, Ditka is 
coming off a losing season. 
</P>
<P>
His 1989 club finished 6-10, descending from a league-best of 52-11 (.825) 
during 1985-88. And if the depression continues, anything could happen -- to 
the emotionally driven leader or his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the 1990 question is whether Ditka makes friends or foes of his 
numerous new players, who are among the youngest in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Although the kids let him down last year, he seems sold on them as athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm picking us to win the division because I think we have the talent," Ditka 
said the other day. "But kids are so different now. They're paid so . . . much. 
They've had so much -- they've had everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I tried hard to reach them -- I tried to hit a chord. I've never 
tried harder in my life, but they didn't hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Will they hear him this year? 
</P>
<P>
Critics doubt it. In 1990 predictions, many are placing Chicago behind one or 
more of the three NFC Central rivals the Bears used to consistently dominate: 
Minnesota, Detroit and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
One reporter identified the Bears as a fourth-place team and then, expressing a 
prevalent thought, asked: "Can the (Chicago) players get along with Mike Ditka? 
There's a groundswell of dislike for (Ditka) in the locker room right now." 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, the Bears' locker room could be the only such place in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Ditka remains the toast of the city -- one of Chicago's most popular 
sports figures and one of its best-known celebrities in any field. 
</P>
<P>
Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet, mentioning Ditka's restaurant and the many 
television commercials starring the Bear coach, said: "Mike is Mr. Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
The coach's midtown restaurant, one of the nation's few successful sports 
restaurants, was the first in Illinois to make the national top 25 in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Author Pete Gent, after dinner there one night, observed: "(Ditka) is the 
perfect celebrity for Chicago, and Chicago is his kind of town. He combines, 
with an exceptional flair and ease, the panache of the Lake Forest swells and 
the pulsing drive of the (working class)." 
</P>
<P>
But . . . disliked in his own locker room? 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty strong. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, perhaps nobody in the NFL this season faces a challenge like 
Ditka's: At 50, is he too set in his irascible ways to win the respect of 
new-generation players, and, in so doing, hold the respect of the city he 
loves? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HE'S BEEN THERE 
</P>
<P>
That Ditka could be on the outs with football players remains inconceivable to 
many fans. For he's a man who has been there. In his playing days, he was an 
NFL star, a flinty tight end who played his way into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrated for selfless blocking, for toughness, for continuously hard-edged 
performances, Ditka was simultaneously a great, soft-handed receiver. 
</P>
<P>
As a Bear rookie in 1961, he caught 56 passes, then improved every year through 
1964, when he caught 75. That set an NFL tight-end record that lasted into the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka could play. 
</P>
<P>
He could also infuriate those he played with. At Pitt, they talk about the day 
that a teammate, Chuck Reinhold, missed a tackle on Herb Adderley as Michigan 
State scored to take a one-touchdown lead. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the locker room, Reinhold said: "We're only down 7-0. It's only 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, boiling, said: "That's bull. You had a chance to make the play, and you 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, Reinhold said later, Ditka bounced him off a locker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably wrong," Ditka admitted after he thought it over. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't apologize to Reinhold for a week. 
</P>
<P>
After Ditka moved his act to the NFL, fans were no safer than teammates or 
opponents. In a game against the Rams in Los Angeles one Saturday night in 
1966, Ditka, as the Bears' tight end, was enraged when a misguided fan jumped 
onto the Coliseum field and ran around crazily, as if, perhaps, he was 
motivated by one too many beers. 
</P>
<P>
The officials called time and then called for the police, but Ditka prefers 
direct action. Stepping suddenly out of the Bears' huddle, he floored the 
intruder with a punch to the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had been laughing. Now it booed Ditka -- not that it bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a fan has any right on a football field," he said then, and 
still contends, still thoroughly satisfied with his role as policeman, judge 
and jury. 
</P>
<P>
As a coach, Ditka throws tantrums or clipboards more often than punches, most 
notably on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
One time after his team punted to Detroit, Ditka, in a typical act of 
exasperation, ran up to Bear tight end Tim Wrightman and screamed: "You took a 
wrong split." 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, Wrightman, one of his brightest players, replied: "I have no idea what 
you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, as Ditka ranted on, Wrightman walked away. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, it turned out that Wrightman was right and Ditka wrong. After 
inspecting the films, Ditka apologized. 
</P>
<P>
As he often is, he was full of remorse -- the morning after. 
</P>
<P>
That's Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
In any competitive situation, Chicago Tribune writer Don Pierson said, "Mike 
fights fire with gasoline, and says he's sorry later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TOP SERGEANT 
</P>
<P>
Extreme competitiveness makes Ditka what he is, and after years of battling and 
berating and erupting, he looks the part. 
</P>
<P>
In a war movie, he would be the tough old top sergeant that even colonels defer 
to. 
</P>
<P>
With a face like a clenched fist, Ditka is one the most recognizable coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the NFL's most domineering coach since Vince Lombardi, he comes 
across as the authority figure some football fans want. That accounts for much 
of his national popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other old player, Ditka limps from a collection of old injuries but 
ignores the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Even a 1988 heart attack failed to change him. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, on his first day back, Ditka promised: "You will never hear me 
yelling or screaming again." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after another tirade, he said: "I lie a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ditka is more candid than most. He is also sharper and more 
considerate than many, taking a personal interest, for one thing, in the Bears' 
organization employees. 
</P>
<P>
Walking down the hall one morning early in his coaching career, he turned a 
corner and bumped into one of the dozens of employees, a club secretary, 
Barbara Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Coach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Barb," Ditka said. "How's things in Kenosha?" 
</P>
<P>
Later, she told a friend: "Amazingly, he already knows us all. He even knows 
I'm from Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
After years of observation, Allen defines Ditka in terms of two traits. 
</P>
<P>
"He believes in himself," she said. "And he believes that everyone else should 
believe in him, too." 
</P>
<P>
If the younger Chicago players can't quite go along with that, the explanation, 
possibly, is that they don't relate to Ditka the player. They're too young to 
have seen him illustrate, personally, the all-out, reckless-abandon style he 
recommends. 
</P>
<P>
Anther explanation is that he apparently wields player pain and discomfort 
deliberately, as a motivational weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Ditka keeps the (Bear team) on edge," Sun-Times football columnist Kevin Lamb 
said. "He makes the players turn to each other for emotional support, just as 
they must do to win on the field." 
</P>
<P>
If they don't like it, they aren't supposed to like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TROUBLE-SHOOTER 
</P>
<P>
Almost perversely, Chicago's losing season a year ago has heightened the public 
interest in Ditka. As a winner, he was a big man in the Midwest, particularly 
after his 1985 team won the Super Bowl. As a loser, he seems to attract even 
more attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know what he's going to do next," Bear spokesman Bryan 
Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
If his first 50 years provide a guide, Ditka isn't about to recede into the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
As early as his Little League days -- the year he turned 11 -- adversity only 
spurred him to more action. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for instance, the time that the Ditka brothers' battery was losing 
its grip on a Little League game. On the mound, Mike's brother, Ashton, the 
team's ace pitcher, walked a couple of batters as catcher Mike stewed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mike called time, put Ashton behind the plate, and took the mound 
himself, pitching out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
An inning later when the team's shortstop made an error, Mike called time 
again, and switched positions with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many friends in Little League," he said, recalling his behavior 
in those formative years. "But I loved the (competition)." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Carnegie, Pa., Ditka grew up in nearby Aliquippa with a younger 
sister and two younger brothers in the family of a steel-mill welder for the 
railroad. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandparents came over from the Ukraine, and my grandfather went into the 
mill," he said. "So did my dad. 
</P>
<P>
"And the mill was waiting for me, too -- although I'd never be there now. By 
now, I'd be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys I played sports with as a kid have been laid off." 
</P>
<P>
He said his earliest memory was the sight of his father coming home from the 
mill. There were burns on the senior Ditka's arms, and burn holes in all his 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
When in later years there were more rather than fewer burns, Mike was driven to 
consider a different vocation. 
</P>
<P>
"I got interested in dentistry, and went to school to be a dentist," he said. 
"However, the opportunity to play pro ball came up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RICH MAN 
</P>
<P>
Today, he lives the life of a rich man in a big new house in suburban 
Bannockburn, 15 minutes west of the Bears' practice field in upscale Lake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is the former Diana Tratham, and their friends say that she is as 
outgoing in social settings and as straightforward as Mike is. They were 
married 14 years ago. There are four grown children from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
On a clear day, after getting up at 5:15 for a vigorous exercise program, Ditka 
heads for the office in a 1936 Auburn roadster, or perhaps a 1948 Packard 
convertible. He collects old cars. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a taste for spirits. Once during the Bears' Super Bowl season -- 
after celebrating, on an airplane, a victory over San Francisco -- he was 
arrested on the way home for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
They calculate in Chicago that Ditka's income is about $3 million annually -- 
counting revenue from television commercials, speeches, restaurants and the 
Bears, who pay him $700,000 on a contract that ends after this season. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the '80s, club president Michael B. McCaskey waited until near the end 
of Ditka's final contract year before making it definite that the coach would 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our coach, and we want him," the employer said again this week. 
</P>
<P>
Said the employee: "I'll coach some more, but not forever. It's a young man's 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka knows he can always make a living on the lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm night last month, he delivered his last speech of 1990 -- except for 
the quiet little talks he is reserving for his football team -- at a small city 
in Indiana, where they said with their applause that he earned his $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
His message was carefully aimed at those who wished to sell more insurance or 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka ended the speech, as he almost always does, with a few words from a 
former citizen of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, who never suspected that he would 
someday be stirring an NFL coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the best I could, and I did the best I know how," said the 10th coach of 
the Bears, quoting the 16th president of the United States. "And I'll keep 
right on doing it up to the end. If the end brings me out all right, then what 
is said against me will not matter. If the end brings me out all wrong, then 10 
angels swearing I was right will make no difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PARADOXES 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka's future is what concerns him. If there is a 6-10 season in his 
past, there is also a Super Bowl, but that's all water over the dam. 
</P>
<P>
What can he do for Chicago this season? 
</P>
<P>
If no one can say, one reason is that Ditka's career is a study in 
contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, he was brought into coaching by one of the NFL's most successful 
leaders of the last 30 years, Tom Landry. The Dallas Cowboys were a winner in 
their Ditka days, and Landry, apparently, saw the makings of a coach in the 
tight end he imported from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Landry's view, Ditka was not endorsed by the rest of the Dallas staff. 
</P>
<P>
In a staff poll one night at the Cowboys' Thousand Oaks camp, when there were 
nine or 10 names on the ballot, Ditka was voted the least likely Landry 
assistant to succeed as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few he impressed favorably was Dan Reeves, now of the Denver 
Broncos, who admires Ditka's intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves recalls playing cards with Ditka and several others one time at Thousand 
Oaks when Ditka, between deals, got so mad at himself or the cards or somebody 
that he stood up and threw his chair across the room. 
</P>
<P>
"All four legs stuck in the wall," Reeves said, marveling at Ditka's power. "I 
told myself, 'Man, this guy hates to lose.' " 
</P>
<P>
At about the time that Dallas assistants were voting against Ditka, the late 
George Halas was voting for him. 
</P>
<P>
That was at the outset of the '80s, when Halas was going over all the people he 
knew and had worked with and against -- in a career that spanned 60 NFL years. 
Of all these, he selected his old tight end to run the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Ditka, the prince of contradictions, is a link through Halas to the 
league's beginnings -- almost the only remaining link. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka is at his most paradoxical in player relations. His sideline outbursts -- 
and, perhaps more damaging, his falling-out with his younger players late last 
season -- are the stuff of legends. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago writer Lamb, who keeps track of the coach's outbursts, calls him Mt. 
Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Ditka has been one of the most successful motivators of his era. When Bill 
Walsh was winning in San Francisco with a superior understanding of modern 
football, Ditka was winning with a superior knowledge of how to make athletes 
play to their potential. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only NFL coach who has his players ready for every game," said 
Chicago reporter Pierson, president of the Pro Football Writers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, Pierson predicted, the Bear coach will have a four-word epitaph that 
sums it all up: "His teams played hard." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that Ditka would break an arm, if necessary, to inspire his 
players. Indeed, he once did. Lecturing the Bears on a performance that 
displeased him, he banged a table so hard that he broke a bone in his fist. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, with his right arm in a cast, he stood up at a team meeting and 
implored: "Win this one for Lefty." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka also concedes that in the NFL, playing smart football helps. Talking the 
other day about his 1990 plans, he said the Bears will use some no-huddle plays 
on offense, and adjust from run-oriented to pass-oriented defense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when asked to put his football philosophy into a sentence, he said: "Hit 
'em again harder." 
</P>
<P>
He confessed that he's sorry if his temper tantrums have offended the Bears, or 
anyone else, in his nine years as Chicago's coach. 
</P>
<P>
How sorry? 
</P>
<P>
"Along with Frank Sinatra, I have some regrets about a few things," Ditka said. 
"But they're too few to remember."

RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
GREENE SAYS TEAM IS PLAYING LIKE A MILLION, OFFERING MUCH LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While the Rams were beating the Kansas City Chiefs in West Berlin Saturday, 
Kevin Greene was at home in Orange County, watching the exhibition game on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought about the Rams' 19-3 victory, the holdout outside 
linebacker said, "I think the Rams are on their way to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
But will Greene be with them? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greene may like the Rams' performance on the field, but the team's front office 
is another matter. Greene, who led the team with 16 1/2 sacks last season, said 
Monday there has been no progress in negotiations with the Rams and no meetings 
are scheduled between his agent, Marvin Demoff, and team representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who made $250,000 last season, has reportedly asked for $1 million a 
year, a figure he believes is commensurate with salaries for the league's best 
linebackers. The club has reportedly offered $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Greene hasn't made any trade demands, as defensive tackle Doug Reed and 
offensive tackle Jackie Slater have, but he appears ready to hold his ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this is discouraging and frustrating, but it's a game they force 
you to play," Greene said. "I would have liked to have signed in April, May or 
June, and it's mid-August now. They want you to play the negotiating game." 
</P>
<P>
How long will Greene play? 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it takes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ram Coach John Robinson says the game will go on, despite the 
absence of Greene, Slater, Reed, and two other holdouts, Damone Johnson (tight 
end) and Michael Stewart (safety). 
</P>
<P>
"They were not the topics of conversation last week in Berlin," Robinson said, 
updating the status of negotiations. "It's interesting, there is a lot of talk 
about these things, but teams go on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same as if they were injured. You just go on. It's part of the game." 
In Greene's absence, George Bethune, a second-year player from Alabama, started 
at outside linebacker and had two sacks for a loss of 15 yards Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bethune continues at his present rate, he'll have 32 sacks this year," 
Robinson said. "And then he'll hold out next year." 
</P>
<P>
Catch of the day: Saturday's exhibition did little to decide who would be the 
team's fourth wide receiver, a spot sought by rookies Tim Stallworth from 
Washington State, Tony Lomack from Florida, Derrick Faison, a free agent from 
Howard, and Monty Gilbreath, a free agent from San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four particularly stood out, although Lomack did make a one-handed 
catch of Mark Herrmann's 11-yard pass that was thrown behind him in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
None of them hurt their chances, either. Faison caught two passes for 30 yards, 
Lomack caught two for 25 yards, Gilbreath had a 20-yard reception, and 
Stallworth had a 16-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese couldn't recall any dropped passes. 
</P>
<P>
Balls that should have been caught were caught. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who had a chance to catch the ball did a pretty good job," Zampese 
said. "But nobody jumped out and said, 'Hey, I'm a receiver and can play in 
this league.' Nobody separated themselves from the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Stallworth, the highest draft pick (sixth round) among the rookie receivers, is 
considered the front-runner for the job, but Zampese said that Faison, the 
biggest wide receiver on the roster at 6 feet 4 and 200 pounds, is gaining 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know much about him initially, but all of a sudden he has started 
making the plays," Zampese said. "I couldn't pick a fourth receiver now, but 
some have moved up on the list, and some who were ahead of the others are not 
so far ahead anymore. Faison has moved up." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibition games have been notorious for dragging on for 3 1/2 hours or more 
because of continual substitutions, numerous penalties and often sloppy play 
from second- and third-stringers. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday's Rams-Chiefs game was over in 2 hours 34 minutes, a tribute in 
part to the Rams' play selection and success. Most of their running plays were 
up the middle and, after several completions, receivers stayed in bounds rather 
going out of bounds to stop the clock. Another factor is new NFL rules designed 
to speed up play.

Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson praised the play of his offense and defense in Saturday's 
game but had nothing special to say about the special teams. The Rams missed 
one of two extra-point attempts and one of three field-goal attempts. They 
averaged only 36 yards on five punts, and Hank Ilesic, who is battling Kent 
Elmore for the punting job, strained his left hamstring when he bent over to 
pick up a low snap in the first quarter. "Our special teams were a joke -- not 
a very funny one," Robinson said. "We would have lost a regular-season game 
with that kind of performance." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' flight from Berlin to Los Angeles was delayed five hours in Ireland 
Sunday because of mechanical problems. What was supposed to have been an 
11-hour trip was an 18-hour journey, and the team didn't arrive until about 7 
p.m. Sunday. "We may look like mummies, but we're practicing today," Robinson 
said Monday. . . . The Rams will break training camp at UC Irvine Friday 
morning, and subsequent practices will be at Rams Park.

Laker guard Michael Cooper seems to have one foot in Italy and the other in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"We must only wait for a few days for the actual signing," Valerio Bianchini, 
coach of Il Messaggero of Rome, told a sports newspaper in Milan. "Cooper is 
practically in our hands." 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers said no decision on Cooper has been made. Last week it was 
reported that the Lakers are planning to put Cooper on waivers Wednesday. Any 
NBA team would have 48 hours to claim him at his salary of a little more than 
$600,000. If all teams pass, Cooper would be free to accept the Il Messaggero 
offer.

NEWSWIRE: FBI LOOKING INTO STEINBRENNER FAVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI has started a formal inquiry into reports that past and present agents 
in the Tampa, Fla., field office conducted personal favors for New York Yankee 
owner George Steinbrenner, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported in today's editions that one of the favors included 
gathering information on gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility decided last Friday that a 
full-scale inquiry was warranted, FBI spokesman Mike Kortan told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Unidentified investigators said last week that Steinbrenner, who also owns the 
American Ship Building Co. in Tampa, reciprocated for the information about 
Spira by inviting bureau officials to his personal box at Tampa Bay Buccaneer 
games and offering high-paying jobs to those who were especially helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The retired agents said the background checks made for Steinbrenner were part 
of a long pattern of assistance orchestrated by Phillip McNiff, a former FBI 
agent who is now a vice president at American Ship Building. 
</P>
<P>
McNiff, the special agent in charge of the Tampa office at the time, later 
became one of three FBI agents, including John Lawn, a former Drug Enforcement 
Agency chief, to go to work for Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Spira was indicted on charges of extorting $40,000 from Steinbrenner for 
information to discredit then-Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield. Winfield now 
plays for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, one of Steinbrenner's lawyers, Robert E. Banker, accused baseball 
Commissioner Fay Vincent and his investigator, John Dowd, of making a deal with 
Spira for evidence against Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's association with and payment to Spira caused Vincent to force 
Steinbrenner to quit as general partner of the team by Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Banker said Vincent is trying to discredit the eight-count federal indictment 
against Spira, who is accused of threatening to harm and attempting to extort 
the owner. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent and Spira's lawyer denied the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a deal with Spira that in return for information damaging George, 
they would assist Spira in some way with regards to the criminal prosecution," 
Banker said in a telephone interview. "Or they simply don't want the Spira case 
tried because they don't want the public to hear what Spira has to say or what 
George has to say. I can't think of any other reason."

CHANGES EXPECTED AT LONGACRES AFTER 11 HORSES ARE DESTROYED

<P>
Horsemen are blaming poor track conditions for the startling number of 
racehorses destroyed so far during this meeting at Longacres Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven horses have been destroyed because of racing injuries since the meet 
began in April, said Dr. John Procter, the Washington State Racing Commission's 
track veterinarian since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Four were destroyed in April, one each in May and June, and five were destroyed 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 10 horses were destroyed as a result of racing accidents between April 
and July. 
</P>
<P>
"This year it appears to me more than in previous years that a lot of them have 
injuries that terminate the racing career," Procter said. "A lot of it is the 
track." 
</P>
<P>
Track conditions have drawn protests from both jockeys and animal-rights 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Even Michael Alhadeff, president of Longacres Race Track, lost a horse, Table 
Fifteen, in July. Earlier that day, a filly broke down in front of the 
grandstand and had to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The problems led track managers to bring in heavy machinery last week and rip 
up the entire track to a depth of about one foot, the most extensive 
maintenance since the surface was laid in 1933. The track had not been tilled 
in two years. 
</P>
<P>
But even that renovation is considered short term. 
</P>
<P>
Starting next week, discussion of a long-term solution will begin by an ad hoc 
committee of trainers, riders, owners and Longacres managers, with an outside 
soil engineer as consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear it all the time that this year has been an unusually hard track, that 
in the opinion of many it is not kind to horses," said Ed Moger, executive 
secretary of the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a serious situation. . . . We've been struggling all year with this race 
track." 
</P>
<P>
The track used to be resurfaced to a depth of eight inches four or five times a 
year, but for the last two years conditions did not warrant the maintenance, 
said Michael O'Donin, track general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Procter said there generally are more injuries to horses in the last two months 
of the meet -- August and September -- because of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Weather has also been a factor this year, Procter said, noting the wet spring. 
Hot weather began early and the track hardened. Training for the 125-day meet 
began Feb. 1 and racing started April 4. 
</P>
<P>
In late May, some of the track's top jockeys, including last year's leader, 
Gary Boulanger, walked off their jobs for a day to protest track conditions. 
</P>
<P>
On June 16, about 25 members of the Northwest Animal Rights Network staged a 
Longacres protest to decry the number of racing-related horse deaths at that 
time -- five in two months -- the state of the track and the use of drugs in 
Washington racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to see these beautiful horses break down in front of the 
grandstand," said Ralph Vacca, general manager of the Washington Thoroughbred 
Breeders Assn. "That turns all our stomachs." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the track and the HBPA hired John Koloski, a soil engineer with 
GeoEngineers Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., to examine the track. His recommendations 
were presented recently to the HBPA board and resulted in last week's track 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Moger said the ad hoc committee will begin meeting this week to draw up a 
long-term solution. A report is expected in a month. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to have a track that's kind to the animals," he said.

UNSOLD RESIDENCES SET RECORD IN JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A record number of single-family houses and condominiums went unsold in July, 
but sales picked up 5% compared to June, the San Fernando Valley Board of 
Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The board said 3,332 houses and condominiums were added to the for sale list in 
the Valley in July, increasing the total number of active listings to 13,973, 
2% more than in June, and 35% more than the previous July. 
</P>
<P>
There were some signs that sellers of single-family houses were willing to 
lower their prices to attract buyers in the glutted market. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the average resale price of a single-family house in July fell 5% to 
$291,800 from $307,800 in June. The average price was 1% lower than a year ago, 
when the average single-family house sold for $295,800. 
</P>
<P>
Sales volume rose slightly as prices retreated. A total of 790 single-family 
houses were sold in July, 5% more than the 751 sold in June. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the pace of sales was 33% slower than last July's, when 1,171 
single-family houses changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were no signs that condominium sellers were willing to lower 
their expectations. The average resale price of a condominium hit a record high 
of $157,200, rising 1% from $155,600 in June. The average condo resale price 
marked a 4% increase since July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The number of condominiums resold also climbed 4% in July, compared to June -- 
but condo sales volume was 28% lower than a year before. 
</P>
<P>
The board in a statement said a 22% decline in the number of new single-family 
house listings in July as compared to June was "the first clear-cut signal to 
date" that homeowners' expectations of high sales prices could be easing. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who weren't serious about selling have changed their minds and 
are letting listings expire," said Jim Link, executive vice president of the 
board, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of moderation were particularly apparent among more expensive houses. The 
board said houses in the $500,000 to $750,000 price range sold for an average 
of 11% less than the original asking price. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and 
condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its 
statistics do not include most new residences.

MODELS: A CALABASAS MANUFACTURER OF RADIO-CONTROLLED HELICOPTERS TRIES TO 
OVERCOME A TRADE DISPUTE AND STAY AIRBORNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Gorham, president of Gorham Model Products in Calabasas, said he can't 
sleep at night anymore. He mortgaged his home to the hilt and used all his 
savings trying to keep his tiny firm, which makes radio-controlled model 
helicopter kits, from going under. 
</P>
<P>
Things are so grim for Gorham that he got a call from his bank last week 
telling him his personal checking account was $1,000 overdrawn. He instructed 
the bank to transfer money from the $5,000 he has left from a second mortgage 
on his house. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working day by day now," said Gorham. "All of my moxie is almost gone." 
</P>
<P>
But not completely. Gorham, 68, still has enough pluck left to hope that he'll 
be able to obtain bank financing to buy his company the time he said it needs 
to recover. Without a loan, he said, he'll be out of business in three to four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham blames his troubles on a Japanese company, Hirobo, which used to be 
Gorham's biggest supplier. He said Hirobo undercut him by allowing its Canadian 
distributors to infiltrate his market in the United States. One of the Canadian 
companies calls it "free trade." Gorham calls it "unfair trade practices." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Gorham is hurting. After reaching $3 million in sales in 1986 and 
1987 and profits of about 9 cents on the dollar, Gorham Model's sales have sunk 
to a little more than $1 million and it's losing about $20,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Until May of last year, Gorham was Hirobo's U.S. distributor for its model 
helicopters and related parts. Hirobo is a small company by Japanese standards; 
of its roughly $50 million a year in revenue, only a small percentage comes 
from sales of helicopter models. It also makes industrial products. 
</P>
<P>
The motor-powered model helicopters are literally scaled-down versions of the 
real thing, weighing about 5 to 9 pounds and sized up to 1 1/2 feet tall and 
about four feet long. They are mostly sold in toy and hobby shops and are 
purchased by a small but growing legion of radio-controlled flying buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 180,000 members of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, an association of 
flying-model enthusiasts, about 95% fly radio-controlled helicopters and the 
number keeps increasing, association spokesman Geoffrey Styles said. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than six companies throughout the world make the helicopter parts, 
assembly kits and fully constructed models. 
</P>
<P>
The British-born Gorham worked for years as an aerospace engineer and in the 
late-1960s and early 1970s was the chief engineer of flight guidance and 
control systems for Lockheed's L-1011 commercial jet. After leaving Lockheed, 
he worked as an independent consultant, but in 1978 he became intrigued by the 
model helicopter hobby and started building and designing his own 
radio-controlled helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Gorham built and flew 10 model helicopters for Universal Pictures' 
"All Night Long," a movie with Barbra Streisand and Gene Hackman. After filming 
was completed, he took the models to a trade show and generated enough orders 
to get his company off the ground. He formed the allegiance with Hirobo in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, Gorham said, his sales of Hirobo products -- which then accounted 
for nearly two-thirds of his total sales -- started to drop precipitously. 
After asking around the industry, he discovered that many American dealers were 
being supplied with Hirobo helicopter products by two Canadian companies, 
Udisco in Montreal and Yellow Aircraft in Vancouver. These companies were 
undercutting his prices -- which range from $200 to about $800 per helicopter 
-- by about 30%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham said he built his business on providing service and technical support to 
customers, while the Canadian companies are only distributors. However, he 
would end up giving free service to buyers of the Hirobo products that were 
sold by the Canadian distributors because there was no way of knowing which 
distributor provided the models, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham complained to Hirobo about the Canadian distributors and other problems 
he perceived -- such as a lack of quality in a key product line that was 
allowing a competing company to gain market share and costing Gorham money for 
repairs and replacements. Eventually, Hirobo executives consented to meet with 
him, Gorham said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place in May, 1989, didn't produce the results Gorham 
expected. Afterward, Hirobo stopped all shipments to Gorham and wouldn't 
respond to numerous phone calls, letters and faxes, Gorham said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon Kunin, vice president of Udisco, said he has continued to sell only to 
dealers in Canada, but argued that there's little he can do if those dealers 
sell the products in the United States. "That's free trade," he said. "It's 
restricting trade if you tell a dealer, 'You can't sell here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hirobo broke its verbal agreement with Gorham by allowing 
helicopters from other distributors to be sold in Gorham's territory, said 
Robert James Terry, a Long Beach-based interpreter who also acted as a 
consultant to Gorham in his dealings with Hirobo. But, Terry added, Gorham 
erred by not insisting the agreement be put in writing from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"John went into a business arrangement with Hirobo on a handshake," Terry said. 
"He made a mistake in dealing with the Japanese in not signing a contract with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Hirobo could not be reached for comment. The company is currently selling its 
model helicopters in the United States through an Edison, N.J., firm named 
Altech Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually overnight, Gorham said his business was nearly devastated. He saw a 
way out by finding local subcontractors to make replacement parts for the parts 
he previously bought from Hirobo. He also worked on new designs that he hoped 
would set new standards for helicopter models. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham's efforts earned respect from model hobbyists. His helicopters are among 
the most popular, said Larry Spurling, spokesman for the Radio Control Hobby 
Trade Assn. Randy Gibson, events coordinator for the International Radio 
Control Helicopter Assn., said "in a lot of ways the quality has gone up since 
the separation." 
</P>
<P>
Gorham also survived by cutting overhead and by digging further into his parts 
inventory. His staff, once numbering 22, is now down to 15, and "we keep the 
lights down and the heat off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as Gorham has been busy regearing his company, the expense of creating new 
products and finding subcontractors has slowly drained his working capital. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a viable company," Gorham said. "All we need is a little cash."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERFECTDATA POSTS STRONGEST 1ST QUARTER IN ITS HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PerfectData Corp., a Simi Valley maker of cleaning and maintenance supplies for 
computer equipment, reported a $138,000 profit in its fiscal first-quarter that 
ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, the company earned less than $1,000 in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The higher profit came on an 84% jump in PerfectData's sales, to $1.42 million 
from $773,000. The company attributed the gains to recent restructuring efforts 
and said it was the strongest fiscal first quarter in its history.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: INTERNATIONAL REMOTE TRIMS QUARTERLY NET LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Remote Imaging Systems Inc., a Chatsworth manufacturer of 
urinalysis machines, said it narrowed its net loss to $85,945 in the second 
quarter that ended June 30 from $745,963 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues increased 34% to $1.14 million from $854,071. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months that ended in June, International Remote lost $144,348, 
compared to a net loss of $1.14 million in the year-earlier period. Revenues 
were $2.22 million, an 18% gain from $1.89 million a year before. International 
Remote said the narrower losses reflected increased product sales and revenues 
from research and development, and decreases in operating expenses.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MATTHEWS STUDIO PROFIT FALLS 8% IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthews Studio Equipment Group, a Burbank company that makes and rents movie 
and television production equipment, said its fiscal third-quarter profit fell 
8% from a year earlier despite a 51% jump in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company's net income in the quarter that ended June 30 slipped to $180,648 
from $196,584 a year earlier, while its revenue climbed to $5.86 million from 
$3.88 million. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarter included a higher provision for income taxes, which 
depressed earnings, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, however, Matthews' profit soared 
to $437,857 from $5,720, and its revenue rose to $14.8 million from $10.3 
million. Matthews said the gains reflected its buildup of production equipment 
available for lease, and the "extremely strong entertainment industry 
environment" that maintained demand for its products.

BROKER PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD IN MAGNA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: HERBERT STONE HAS AGREED TO COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS 
NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE WILL TESTIFY AGAINST HIS CO-DEFENDANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of four defendants accused of stock fraud in a criminal indictment 
involving Magna Technologies, a defunct Thousand Oaks company, pleaded guilty 
in federal court in Los Angeles on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Stone, a former securities broker who made a market in Magna's stock, 
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, seven counts of securities fraud and 
four counts of wire fraud. Each of the 12 counts carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stone is currently serving a two-year sentence in federal prison for stock 
manipulation unrelated to Magna. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Stone's co-defendants, Robert Victor, a former Magna shareholder, and 
Robert Gutstein, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon and Magna's former chairman, 
have pleaded not guilty to the charges and are scheduled to go to trial Nov. 
27. Assistant U.S. Atty. John Walsh said Stone "has agreed with the government 
to cooperate," but it hasn't yet been determined whether he'll testify against 
Victor and Gutstein. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth defendant, Jacob Rubenstein, a shareholder and principal promoter of 
Magna, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
Victor is a convicted felon formerly known as Robert Viggiano. He was referred 
to in police reports from the investigation of ZZZZ Best, the defunct Reseda 
carpet cleaning company, as "a reputed member of the Colombo organized crime 
family." During the securities fraud trial of ZZZZ Best founder Barry Minkow, 
defense attorneys said Victor, a ZZZZ Best shareholder, used threats and 
violence to force Minkow into the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Victor was never charged with a crime relating to ZZZZ Best. Minkow was 
convicted in 1988 of 57 counts of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Magna indictment charged the co-defendants with 42 counts of conspiracy, 
and securities, wire, bank and tax fraud. Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four 
others were also accused of manipulating Magna stock in a related civil suit 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants entered summary judgments in the civil suit, agreeing to stop 
the activities cited in the suit without admitting or denying guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said that in 1985 Magna was merged with Bashney Biscuit, a 
bankrupt, publicly traded corporation, thereby creating freely traded Magna 
stock without registering the stock with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants then carried out a scheme to artificially inflate Magna's stock 
price, the indictment said. The company once boasted that it acquired the 
rights to such offbeat products as a flexible pouch for carrying liquids, a 
battery-operated "stun gun," a device to aid sexually impotent men and a 
hand-held, battery-operated "pain reliever." 
</P>
<P>
The government said no products were produced by Magna during the period named 
in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also said the defendants enlisted the aid of friends and 
relatives who set up accounts at brokerage firms to trade in Magna stock. Using 
these accounts, the defendants drove the stock price up using tactics such as 
"wash sales," in which a person buys and sells the same block of stock, 
"matched sales," which involves two people trading the same block of stock, and 
"free-riding," a technique of placing orders for stock without intending to pay 
for them, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
From March to September, 1985, Magna's stock climbed from 50 cents a share to 
$9.50 before collapsing. The indictment said the defendants made more than $1 
million through sales of Magna stock.

Walt Disney Co., the Burbank-based entertainment conglomerate, has quietly 
acquired control of 2,045 acres along Interstate 4 in Osceola County, letting 
the company determine what type of development will be allowed near its theme 
park and other holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The tract of dead citrus and scrub could prove vital to Disney's long-range 
growth plans, which hinge on the eventual alignment and completion of several 
road projects, including the planned extension of the Orlando Beltway, the 
Orlando Sentinel reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials said they do not plan to expand their own borders. But they 
will work with neighboring landholders to ensure the right kind of development 
occurs in the area, something Disney has not done before. 
</P>
<P>
The deal could help Disney control its own destiny and that of its neighbors, 
the Sentinel reported. It is believed the company is trying to avoid the sort 
of congested development that has occured outside Disneyland in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The series of land deals was completed in April, three weeks after Disney 
announced plans to build a $2.5-billion, high-tech "dream city" in Osceola 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen neighboring landholders deeded 276 acres to Herman J. Heidrich &amp; 
Sons, an Orlando citrus firm with 1,769 acres along Disney's southwest border, 
the Sentinel reported. 
</P>
<P>
The parcels were consolidated under a $17-million single mortgage guaranteed by 
Disney.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: PIANIST SEEMS 
OVERQUALIFIED FOR POPS' 'RHAPSODY IN BLUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>

Pianist Robert Taub's sophisticated resume bristles with world premieres, 
compositions by contemporary composers such as Mel Powell and Milton Babbitt. 
The Mel Powell Concerto for Two Pianos, in which Taub performed last year with 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was awarded the 1990 Pulitzer Prize in music, and 
Taub has just made the first recording of Vincent Persichetti's Piano Concerto 
with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Charles Dutoit. 
</P>
<P>
And Wednesday night the 32-year-old New Yorker plays "Rhapsody in Blue" with 
the San Diego Symphony Pops orchestra at Hospitality Point. 
</P>
<P>
This unlikely progression from the sublime to the overworked prompts an obvious 
question: "What's a nice guy like you doing in a place like that?" 
</P>
<P>
"I like the 'Rhapsody in Blue'," Taub said, carefully crafting his explanation 
as if he were answering a question on a grant application. 
</P>
<P>
"I played the piece last summer with the London Symphony Orchestra. That piece 
captures something I relate with as a New Yorker -- like a Woody Allen movie." 
</P>
<P>
If the orchestra's Summer Pops all-Gershwin concert is a kind of obligatory 
annual ritual, Taub believes he can transcend its casual familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach to the 'Rhapsody in Blue' is not at all fluffy and light. I take 
it seriously, and whatever the programming context may be, I think I can make 
it come off." 
</P>
<P>
Taub's strong identification with 20th-Century American music has changed his 
approach to more traditional piano repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing new music sheds a refreshing perspective on all music. After all, what 
we now regard as 'classical' was once new. For instance, when I play 
Beethoven's 'Waldstein' Sonata, I try to infuse it with the same enthusiasm it 
had on its listeners at its original opening. I have been very careful to make 
sure that the music I choose to play reflects my deep convictions about music 
generally, even though the bulk of my repertory is still Beethoven, Brahms and 
Rachmaninoff." 
</P>
<P>
Pianists that influenced Taub included Dinu Lipatti, Josef Hoffmann and Artur 
Schnabel. Schnabel's refined aesthetic has molded his preference for the late 
Beethoven works as opposed to those from the composer's earlier stormy period. 
Nor is Taub devoted to the flashy, crowd-pleasing showpieces by Franz Liszt. 
</P>
<P>
"I read a biography of Schnabel in my late teens, and the author stressed that 
Schnabel was a great musician as well as a great pianist. That distinction 
stuck with me. A great pianist has control over keyboard, knows how to play the 
instrument and create a wide palette of colors from the piano. But a great 
musician knows how to use these tools to really express something in a work of 
art." 
</P>
<P>
Taub's ability to verbalize his musical experiences will serve him well over 
the next two years when he serves as Harvard University's artist-in-residence, 
a post that includes giving solo recitals, performing with the 
Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and lecturing on performance techniques and piano 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, he can put philosophy on the back burner and devote all of 
his artistic horsepower to five straight nights of "Rhapsody in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
Soprano power. Brenda Wimberly, who made an auspicious local debut two years 
ago as the Mother in West Coast Lyric Opera's production of Menotti's "Amahl 
and the Night Visitors," returns this week for two distinctly different 
engagements. In this week's San Diego Symphony all-Gershwin concerts (Aug. 
15-19), she will sing the soprano parts in a "Porgy and Bess" medley. On Monday 
at 8 p.m., the soprano from Texas will sing a recital of art songs by Mozart, 
Strauss and Faure in the sanctuary of La Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church. 
Her recital is another offering in West Coast Lyric Opera's chamber music 
concerts at the La Jolla church. 
</P>
<P>
Siberian Superstar. Dmitri Hvorostovsky, arguably the hottest new singer in the 
operatic firmament, will give his debut local recital in La Jolla's Sherwood 
Auditorium a week earlier than originally scheduled. The golden-voiced baritone 
will perform a program of Italian art songs and opera arias Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera executive director Ian Campbell signed the 28-year-old singer 
from Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, when he won first prize in the BBC Cardiff Singer of 
the World Competition last summer. Since that dramatic exposure to the West, 
Hvorostovsky has been inundated with glowing reviews. The New Yorker's Andrew 
Porter declared him to be "one of the best voices to be heard today," and his 
first recording for Philips Classics was recently released with no small amount 
of fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
Light Opera in East County. "Luisa Fernanda," a Spanish-language operetta, 
properly called a zarzuela, will open 8 p.m. Thursday at El Cajon's East County 
Performing Arts Center. A popular art form in Spain, the zarzuela is named 
after the royal palace of La Zarzuela outside Madrid where these entertainments 
first took place. 
</P>
<P>
"Luisa Fernanda" was written by Federico Moreno Torroba, one of the two great 
zarzuela composers of the 20th Century. This East County production will be 
conducted by his son, Federico Moreno Torroba Jr. The San Diego Lyric Assn. and 
the Grossmont College opera workshop are producing "Luisa Fernanda," which runs 
through Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Cast problems. Because violist Cynthia Phelps is recovering from a broken arm, 
her assignments in the opening week of the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's 
SummerFest will be covered by Toby Hoffmann and festival artistic director 
Heiichiro Ohyama. Ohyama will take Phelps' place in Schumann's Piano Quintet on 
the Aug. 17 opening night program, and Hoffmann will substitute in the 
Beethoven G Major String Trio on the Aug. 18 private gala concert. Society 
officials expressed confidence that Phelps will be sufficiently recovered to 
resume her playing duties during the festival's second week.

OIL INTERESTS PUSH TO START PUMPING AT POINT ARGUELLO

The oil industry is using the current Middle East crisis to heighten the 
pressure on Santa Barbara County to permit the start-up of the much-delayed 
$2-billion Point Arguello offshore oil project, which sits idle despite its 
completion two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional testimony, radio call-in shows, private meetings and public 
statements, oil officials are pointing to the Point Arguello project -- with 
its three platforms 10 miles off Point Conception and 55 miles northwest of 
Santa Barbara -- as an example of how government has impeded domestic oil 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives estimate that the project, which taps into an undersea oil 
reserve with as much as 300 million barrels of recoverable oil, would 
eventually produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day once final approvals are 
given. That would reduce America's dependence on imported oil, such as that 
from Iraq and Kuwait, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since the Iraqi invasion, the federal Department of Energy has 
gotten into the act by calling the Santa Barbara County Resource Management 
Department. Federal officials wanted to "ask us where we are, what's going on 
and what does it take to start the project up," said Robert Almy, the Santa 
Barbara department's deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials remain unimpressed by the new spotlight on the project and 
blame some of the delays on Chevron Corp., the lead partner in the project. 
Chevron could begin production soon if it would choose to move the oil by 
pipeline instead of tanker, they said. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, local environmentalists and community activists continue to 
oppose allowing oil to be shipped by tanker from the project -- oil crisis or 
no. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the oil companies) are just taking advantage of the situation," said 
Henry Feniger, president of Get Oil Out, a Ventura community group that opposes 
offshore oil drilling. "We can't go crazy every time someone in the Middle East 
raises a ruckus." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion, which caused oil prices to rise sharply, raised new 
questions about the availability of domestic oil reserves, particularly in 
offshore and wilderness areas now off-limits to oil production. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the current crisis, the Bush Administration has given no indication 
that it plans to back off from its policy of restricting oil drilling off the 
coasts of California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to Point Arguello, "there's not much we can do, but we're certainly 
in touch with (Chevron) and (Santa Barbara) County," said Philip Keif, a 
spokesman for the Energy Department. He hastened to add: "We're not putting 
pressure on (the county) . . . We're not going to take sides." 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped oil executives from applying pressure to spotlight the 
Point Arguello project, which is financed by a consortium of 18 oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Kenneth T. Derr, chairman of Chevron, discussed the project 
on a live call-in show on San Francisco radio. "We have tried the process of 
negotiating over the last five years with environmentalists . . . (But) we 
still don't produce the oil," Derr said at a press conference after the show. 
"We would hope that the events of the past week would make the process a little 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in New York, meanwhile, Charles J. DiBona, president of 
the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group, urged swift 
approval of oil production at Point Arguello. DiBona had also mentioned the 
project in testimony before a House subcommittee last week. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County officials deny causing the delays. They blame them instead 
on Chevron, saying that the project could begin production of oil from Point 
Arguello as soon as November if Chevron simply would ship the oil by pipeline 
instead of tanker. Chevron already has permits to move the oil by pipeline, 
which the county considers environmentally safer, though more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all this delay because Chevron is trying to save transportation 
costs," said Santa Barbara County Supervisor William Wallace. "We're certainly 
all in favor of the Chevron (project) operating as long as they commit to 
moving it by pipeline out of here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron argues that any pipeline transport alternative would be far costlier, 
impractical, in some cases unworkable, and could still require the use of 
tankers. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, county officials say they will not be swayed in their 
deliberations by the press of events. The Santa Barbara County Board of 
Supervisors will consider a formal response to the Energy Department at a 
meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
The Point Arguello project, which was started more than 10 years ago, is built 
and requires only permits to transport the oil from an onshore terminal at 
Gaviota to refineries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A permit to move the oil by tanker, granted by Santa Barbara County in 1989, 
was revoked by the California Coastal Commission after an appeal by community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was sent back to the county, which is planning to issue a new 
environmental report on tankering as early as next week. A final county vote on 
a new tanker permit request is scheduled for November, though appeals could 
delay final approval for several months after that. Meanwhile, a Chevron 
lawsuit against the Coastal Commission is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy estimated that if approval were given today, 
it would take six months to de-mothball the project and begin production of 
about 20,000 barrels of oil a day. It would take another year to reach 50,000 
to 75,000 barrels a day, and another three to six months to reach maximum 
output of 100,000 barrels a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's pressure, it is unlikely that the current crisis will 
resolve the decade-long argument, observers said. "I'd be surprised if this 
played much of a factor in getting offshore California production on stream any 
faster," said Frederick P. Leuffer Jr., senior oil analyst with C. J. Lawrence, 
Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York.

PROGRAM TRADING PUSHES DOW 30.20 HIGHER ON LIGHT VOLUME

<P>
An afternoon rally sent stock prices higher Monday after a steep opening slump, 
but trading was reduced by a Wall Street power outage that curtailed operations 
at the American Stock Exchange and several brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks rose 30.20 to 2,746.78. But 
declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancing ones in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 up, 766 down and 479 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume slowed dramatically, totaling 122.82 million shares on the Big Board, 
down from 145.34 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened with a thud, with the Dow plunging as much as 32 points in 
the first half hour. The drop followed steep losses overseas on continued 
worries about the Mideast crisis. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei index 
posted its fourth-largest percentage drop ever, losing 1,153.12 points, or 
4.2%, to 26,176.43. It was the lowest close in two years. 
</P>
<P>
But prices in New York began to pick up in the afternoon in a "light-volume 
rally," said Dudley Eppel, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette 
Securities. He said the market had reached an "oversold" state, and some 
investors came in to bargain hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized program trading also was a big influence. "In the light-volume 
days the computer controls the tape. It takes it right out of our hands," Eppel 
said of the program trading. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts advised against reading too much into the rally, noting that the 
market remains hostage to events in the Mideast and to economic concerns. 
Foreign markets' dismal showings may weigh on Wall Street as the week 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
Trading on the American Stock Exchange, as well as on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, was cut off shortly after 1 p.m. EDT after 
a fire knocked out power in Manhattan's financial district. The exchanges were 
forced to halt trading for the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE wasn't affected, but many brokerages said operations were curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Leading the Dow higher were IBM, up 1 3/4 to 103 3/4; Kodak, 2 1/2 to 43 1/2; 
Merck, 2 1/8 to 86 7/8; and Procter &amp; Gamble, 1 7/8 to 81 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Some growth stocks continued to rebound from their recent declines. Compaq 
Computer rose 2 3/8 to 56 1/4, Disney added 2 1/4 to 109 and Home Depot gained 
1 1/4 to 35 3/4 
</P>
<P>
* Investors continued to snap up shares of drug and food firms, classic 
"defensive" stocks in a recession. Ralston Purina jumped 2 1/2 to 94, Heinz 
added 7/8 to 33 3/8 and Bristol Myers rose 1/2 to 61 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Biotech stocks, red-hot before the recent market plunge, roared back. Amgen 
jumped 3 1/8 to 47 on the first day following its 2-for-1 stock split. Chiron 
rose 1 3/4 to 38 1/4, Genzyme gained 1 5/8 to 18 and Centocor leaped 1 3/4 to 
40 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks were mostly higher. Arco rose 2 1/4 to 137 1/4, Unocal added 5/8 
to 32 5/8 and Mobil jumped 1 1/4 to 67 1/8. Meanwhile, gold stocks soared as 
the price of gold rocketed. ASA jumped 2 1/4 to 54 1/4 and Newmont Gold rose 2 
1/2 to 53 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Big gainers among Southland stocks included electronics distributor Marshall 
Industries, up 1 to 24 1/8; computer firm AST Research, 1 1/4 to 21 1/8, and 
Western Waste, 1 1/4 to 19 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Midway Airlines rocketed 2 1/8 to 9 5/8 on a report that American Airlines 
may be looking at bidding for Midway.

CREDIT: Bond Prices Hurt by Inflation Fears 
</P>
<P>
Long-term government bond prices fell Monday on inflation worries and 
oversupply concerns in a session abbreviated by a power outage in lower 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 5/16 point, or about $3.13 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield rose to 8.81% from 8.79% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading, which was light, came to a virtual standstill after a power outage 
shut down most of New York's financial district, including almost all primary 
dealers of government securities. 
</P>
<P>
Traders also were awaiting a series of economic reports due later this week 
that could provide more evidence of economic weakness, and thus point to 
further Federal Reserve moves to lower interest rates. The reports include 
today's release of July retail sales and Thursday's report on consumer prices 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125% when power failed around 1 p.m. EDT. That was up 
from 8% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Pulled Down by Interest Rates 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar slumped against major foreign currencies, which are expected to 
strengthen as interest rates rise overseas while rates fall here. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks because of weakness in the 
U.S. economy, and many traders expect the Federal Reserve will eventually move 
to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy to keep it from a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar fell sharply against the German mark, buying 1.578 
marks versus 1.589 on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was at 150.25 versus 
150.40 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also lost ground against the British pound. In New York, the pound 
rose to $1.8825 from $1.8735 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Grain Prices Fall After Rain Arrives 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures fell sharply and livestock and meat futures were 
mixed. Rain fell Monday in the Mississippi Delta region, where 
drier-than-normal conditions had raised concerns about the soybean crop. 
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasts predicted a continuation of beneficial crop weather in the 
Midwest, where the bulk of corn and beans are grown. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-to-10-day forecast released after the close of grain trading, the 
National Weather Service predicted normal- to above-normal temperatures and 
normal precipitation in the Midwest for the first half of the week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFTERNOON RALLY 
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials slid more than 32 points in the first half-hour of trading 
but struggled back before jumping 30 points near the close. 
</P>
<P>
Friday close: 2,716.58 
</P>
<P>
Monday close: 2,746.78 up 30.20

UTAH TV STATION JUST SAYS 'NO' TO BEER, WINE ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Such familiar advertising phrases as "Give that man a Miller" and "Thanks for 
your support" are going to be heard a lot less on one TV station. 
</P>
<P>
KSL Television, the second-largest station in Salt Lake City and a CBS 
affiliate, said on Monday that it would no longer accept beer or wine 
commercials on its local scheduling. The station, which is owned by the Mormon 
church, will continue to air beer and wine spots on its CBS network 
programming, which accounts for the majority of the beer and wine ads it 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at the station estimate the decision could cost KSL up to $500,000 
in annual advertising revenue -- and probably result in about four fewer beer 
and wine ads each day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not on any crusade here," said William R. Murdoch, executive vice 
president and general manager of the station that 21 years ago was the second 
in the nation to ban locally placed tobacco ads. "But maybe we can save a life 
down the road by reducing the exposure of young people to this advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, who said he is a nondrinker, noted that he made the decision to ban 
beer and wine ads after consulting with department heads at the station. "We 
can't control what the network runs," he said. "But we can control what we run 
locally. This is a very conservative marketplace and CBS understands that." 
</P>
<P>
The station is in the nation's 41st-largest market, with 3 million potential 
viewers in 7 states. 
</P>
<P>
How did CBS respond to its affiliate's decision? "I can tell you they weren't 
going to break out the champagne," said Murdoch. Executives from CBS did not 
return several phone calls late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Television industry executives believe that KSL is the first network-affiliated 
station in the country to specifically slap a ban on beer and wine ads. It will 
generally affect ads sold during local newscasts and local sports programming. 
The question is: Will others follow? 
</P>
<P>
"Will this set a trend? Well, each station has to make up its own mind," said 
Gene Jeffers, vice president of public affairs for the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters, the trade association that represents more than 1,000 TV stations 
nationally. "Advertising income is the sole source of revenues for broadcast 
stations, so they will have to look very carefully at any restrictions they 
apply." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's brewers, who are facing proposed legislation in Congress to 
require safety warnings on all beer products and promotions, are not happy with 
KSL's move. And they strongly deny that limits on beer advertising decrease 
alcohol consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising restrictions do not have a causal relationship to consumption or 
abuse," said Stephen Burrows, vice president of consumer awareness and 
education at Anheuser-Busch Co. The giant beer maker says it hopes the $35 
million it has spent over the past 18 months on its "Know when to say when" 
campaign will help reduce alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
One organization has gone out of its way to praise the move by KSL. "For years, 
TV stations have said they can't survive without beer and wine advertising," 
said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Washington Center for Science 
in the Public Interest. "This is the big test. And I hope it will lead to 
similar moves in other cities. Stations should ask themselves: 'If KSL can do 
it, why can't we?' "

create products that combine video, audio and traditional data operations, plus 
video-conferencing activities on desktop computers. The firms hope that the new 
technology would allow simultaneous use of both the multimedia applications and 
video conferencing activities. Currently both technologies are relatively new 
and untested, particularly on personal computers.

Carolco Seeks Stock Buyback: Carolco Pictures Inc. is negotiating to buy back a 
large block of its common stock from Mario Kassar, company chairman, documents 
released at the Securities and Exchange Commission showed. 
</P>
<P>
Kassar directly and indirectly owns 18.5 million shares of Carolco common 
stock, representing 61% of Carolco's 30.2 million common shares outstanding. 
Los Angeles-based Carolco said it would spend about $45 million in buying back 
the stock, which would mean about 4.5 million shares at current market prices. 
Carolco was the studio behind the "Rambo" movies.

UAW AGREES TO END WALKOUT AT GM PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE AUTO MAKER HOPES TO HAVE ALL OF ITS FACILITIES AFFECTED BY THE 
STRIKE BACK IN OPERATION BY LATER THIS WEEK.

General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union announced late Monday 
afternoon a tentative agreement to end a five-day walkout at the company's AC 
Rochester West parts plant in Flint. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman John Maciarz said a ratification vote was planned for today but 
that no details of the agreement would be released until after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pending ratification, Maciarz said the auto maker hoped to have all of its 
plants and facilities affected by the strike back in operation by later this 
week or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a meeting scheduled for Tuesday (today) at 2 o'clock to go over the 
agreement before the vote," said Larry Sills, strike chairman of UAW Local 659. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have that vote by the afternoon so plants can get back in 
operation," Sills added. 
</P>
<P>
The strike by about 3,200 workers over long-standing disputes concerning 
health, safety, subcontracting and outsourcing has halted output at several GM 
facilities in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Louisiana since last Wednesday, 
idling more than 12,230 workers as of late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the latest plants and facilities to feel the effects of the strike were 
GM's Buick City assembly plant in Flint. About 3,500 workers were sent home by 
noon Monday because of a parts shortage. 
</P>
<P>
GM also sent home about 400 workers who build crew cab chassis at its Flint 
Truck &amp; Bus plant, while an additional 100 workers were idled at its Flint 
Truck &amp; Bus Metal Fabrication plant, bringing the number of idled workers 
there to 388 out of 3,500, company spokesman Tom Pyden said. 
</P>
<P>
The strike also affected workers at other parts plants throughout GM's massive 
operations who had been making components to furnish now halted assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
GM facilities also affected included its Delco Electronics plant in Kokomo, 
Ind., where 150 out of 6,600 workers were idled. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sent 200 of the 7,600 workers at its Packard Electric plant in 
Warren, Ohio, home. 
</P>
<P>
The walkouts include about 2,700 workers at the AC West plant.

Another 360 workers at GM's Flint Tool &amp; Die plant located outside the AC 
complex also walked off the job because they are part of UAW Local 659. 
</P>
<P>
GM, like most car makers, operates on a streamlined inventory system called 
"just-in-time" manufacturing, which cuts costs and improves quality -- but 
makes its assembly plants more vulnerable to strikes at parts facilities.

Deloitte Leaves First Executive: The accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche has 
removed itself as auditor of First Executive Corp., the battered Los Angeles 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Neither First Executive nor the accounting firm gave a reason. First Executive 
recently hired a number of Deloitte &amp; Touche executives. Once one of former 
junk-bond financier Michael Milken's best customers, First Executive lost 
$775.6 million last year, largely because the value of its junk bonds plunged.

MEXICO DETAILS PLAN FOR SELLING NATION'S BANKS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: COMMITTEE WILL SCRUTINIZE WOULD-BE BUYERS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 66% 
STAKE IN 18 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

<P>
Within a year, the Mexican government will begin selling its 66% stake in each 
of the country's 18 commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe on Monday told those attending the National 
Banking Convention that a committee of finance officials will be formed to sell 
the government's interest in the banks -- partly on the Mexican Stock Exchange 
and partly by a complex auction process. 
</P>
<P>
That is a departure from the practice of the past eight years, when hundreds of 
state-owned companies have been auctioned off by a divestiture unit in Mexico's 
Treasury Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
A Treasury official had predicted changes in privatization procedures with the 
pending sales, including the banks, because "before, we were just selling 
companies; now, we are selling an entire economic sector." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, he said, the sales must proceed more carefully and with 
assurances that the new owners have the ability to administer each company. 
Otherwise, the sales could upset the entire national economy, said the 
official, who spoke on condition that his name not be published. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's 60 banks were nationalized in 1982, when the government accused them 
of engaging in policies that contributed to capital flight from the country. 
Since then, the number of banks has been reduced to 18. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the government began selling non-voting shares -- called CAPs, a 
Spanish acronym -- in the banks on the Mexican Stock Exchange. They now account 
for 34% of the ownership of the banks. 
</P>
<P>
As part of privatization, CAPs will become shares with restricted voting 
rights. The government will convert another 15% of each bank's equity into such 
shares, which eventually will be sold on the stock market. This phase of 
privatization is scheduled to be completed by next July. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bank divestiture committee will begin selecting the new 
controlling groups for each bank. 
</P>
<P>
For appraisals, the committee will set uniform standards for internal audits of 
each bank. The National Banking Commission, a regulatory agency, will hire 
external auditors to review the results. 
</P>
<P>
Potential bidders will be asked to present proof of good character and of their 
knowledge of bank administration. Once investor groups qualify, 51% controlling 
interests in the banks will be sold to the highest bidders. 
</P>
<P>
Controlling interest in banks may be purchased by financial holding companies 
with up to 30% foreign ownership. Foreigners may have only a 10% interest in 
investor groups formed specifically to buy banks -- and even that will require 
special approval.

MARKETING: MGM GRAND AIR BREAKS NEWS OF COACH-CLASS SEATS TO TOP-FLIGHT FLIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No passengers choked on their caviar. And none fell out of their specially 
designed sleeper seats. But there was a hushed mumbling among pampered 
passengers on a recent MGM Grand Air jet from Los Angeles to New York. They 
were among the first to learn that the airline that had prided itself on 
first-class-only service was about to introduce -- horror of horrors -- coach 
class. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Vinyl handbags at Gucci? Brass rings at Tiffany? Or maybe a 
Rolls-Royce with an optional V-6? 
</P>
<P>
Top executives at MGM Grand Air knew that breaking the news to customers would 
be mighty tricky. So they carefully tempered the announcement in a specially 
made, four-minute video that raved about all the improvements planned for the 
company's two new jets. More air phones. More first-run films. Even fax 
machines. And oh, yes, 40 seats reserved for coach-class passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent 1 1/2 years looking at this change," said Charles L. Demoney, 
president and chief executive of the luxury airline. "One can only hope we've 
made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
And how to make this change? 
</P>
<P>
"Very skillfully," said Leigh Kimball, director of sales and marketing. "You 
have to begin to isolate the two classes at curbside." That is, give them 
separate lounges, separate security checkpoints and even separate entrances to 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind, MGM Grand Air has a list of regular passengers that looks more 
akin to the guest register at the Ritz-Carlton. Michael J. Fox, Steven 
Spielberg, Eddie Murphy -- and, of course, Madonna -- all regularly ride the 
hoity-toity airline that some call "Snob Air." Now, the biggest names in 
Hollywood will soon be sharing airspace with a bunch of nobodies. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the harsh realities of the frugal '90s. On Monday MGM Grand Air 
broke a new TV ad campaign that specifically contrasts its highly polished 
coach class with that of its rivals. The service is more akin to business class 
than coach, but it has a full-price coach fare of $623 one way. It is called 
"grand class coach" -- hoping to attract the growing number of executives whose 
companies no longer permit first-class travel. 
</P>
<P>
The looming question is: Can MGM Grand Air broaden its market without scaring 
away wealthy customers? Certainly, others have tried similar actions in recent 
years. Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac introduced less expensive models. Neiman 
Marcus and Nordstrom opened stores that carried their leftover merchandise at 
discount prices. Designers ranging from Anne Klein to Calvin Klein broadened 
their appeal with moderate-priced lines. And even American Express cards are 
now commonly carried by the very middle class. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from several companies that have broadened their markets say they 
have done so without tarnishing the company names. 
</P>
<P>
Neiman Marcus, for example, has several Last Call for Neiman Marcus stores -- 
named after Neiman's famous sales -- that sell leftover merchandise at steeply 
discounted prices. The store in Austin is so popular, in fact, that the city 
mentions it as a highlight in its tourism literature. "It hasn't tarnished our 
image," said Pat Zajac, manager of media relations for Neiman Marcus. "It's 
improved it." 
</P>
<P>
Long before Mercedes-Benz introduced its lower-priced 190-series cars in 1983, 
the company interviewed hundreds of longtime customers to find out if they felt 
it would cheapen the Mercedes name. Most said it would not -- as long the 
quality of the new line remained high. 
</P>
<P>
The trick to attracting buyers of $29,000 Mercedes models, without scaring off 
those who prefer the $62,000 versions, "is to have enough distinction between 
the car lines, but also enough family resemblance," said A. B. Shuman, manager 
of public relations at Mercedes-Benz of North America. Already, the 190 series 
accounts for nearly 20% of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Experts who specialize in creating images for companies generally say fiddling 
with an upscale image can be risky. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain appeal to snobbery, particularly in Los Angeles," said 
Robert Kahn, executive director of the Los Angeles office of the corporate 
identity firm, Landor &amp; Associates. "If people perceive this as a 
downgrading of MGM's product, it could really hurt their business." 
</P>
<P>
Added Alan Siegal, chairman of the large New York corporate identity firm, 
Siegal &amp; Gale Inc., "It may look like they're compromising their product." 
</P>
<P>
An executive from the agency that creates ads for Rolex watches says the Rolex 
cachet would be lost if the watchmaker were to introduce a second-tier Rolex. 
Similarly, said James K. Agnew, executive vice president of the Los Angeles 
office of ad agency J. Walter Thompson, "I have a feeling this could dilute 
from and distract the airline's target market." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is a naysayer. Nancy Shalek, president of the Shalek Agency in 
Los Angeles, which created ads for MGM Grand Air before losing the business 
several months ago to Lintas: Campbell Ewald, described MGM's marketing move as 
"a slam dunk." Explained Shalek, "Snobs need someone to be snobby at, or 
there's no snob appeal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defying the Laws of Advertising Gravity 
</P>
<P>
It seems that just about everyone was amazed by the Honda commercial that 
featured a car driving away from its spot on an art gallery wall. But 
executives at the agency that created it, Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates, have 
quietly agonized over the lack of premiere awards the ad has won. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't win the sought-after "Sweepstakes" award this year at the prestigious 
Belding Awards sponsored by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles. Nor did it win 
the coveted Clio Award for best overall TV spot of 1989. But last week the 
agency made off with one of the most significant awards in West Coast 
advertising. The American Advertising Federation christened the agency's Honda 
campaign "The Most Effective Campaign Created in the West in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
That competition takes into consideration not only creativity, but also sales 
results from all print, billboard, TV and radio spots used in the campaign. And 
while Honda's domestic car sales were up only a tad in 1989 compared to 1988, 
many other importers saw double-digit declines in their sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thompson Catches 2, Angles for Big Fish 
</P>
<P>
It has not been a banner year for the Los Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson. 
But after losing one of its biggest clients -- 20th Century Fox Film Corp. -- 
the agency is oh-so-slowly trying to bounce back with small wins. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it picked up two clients that together total about $3 million in new 
billings. The clients are Chipsoft, a San Diego software company that produces 
financial software packages, and Bekins Box &amp; Ship, an offshoot of the 
moving company. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency's eyes remain fixed on the $30-million New Line Cinema account 
now handled by New York-based Independent Media Service. The account has been 
in review for several months. Thompson is one of a half dozen contenders for 
the account -- the largest currently in review on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Rest Stop for Ad-Weary Travelers? 
</P>
<P>
OK, highway drivers. Tired of all those billboards that beg you to buy 
everything from BMWs to beer? Well, someday soon when you pull off at the 
roadside rest stop to get away from all the billboards, guess what may be 
awaiting you: more advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The ads could come courtesy of Reststop Advertising, a Louisville, Ky., company 
that is trying to persuade federal and state government officials to allow it 
to sell advertising space on special kiosks and on restroom panels at rest 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, people probably see too many ads already," said Arthur J. Gerlach Jr., 
chairman of Reststop Advertising. "But we'll only provide the types of 
information that highway travelers want." That is, the ads will mostly be for 
restaurants, hotels and service stations along the interestate. What's more, he 
noted, in most cases the ads will not be visible from the road. 
</P>
<P>
There are no ads permitted now at rest stops along California interstates. But 
Gerlach is licking his chops at the prospect. After all, California has 85 such 
facilities -- a number second only to Florida, which has 93.

The Persian Gulf crisis is one of the reasons, a major antifreeze marketer said 
Monday.

"Chemicals needed to produce antifreeze . . . are in tight domestic supply,"

PANELS OK FULL BAN ON SMOKING IN RESTAURANTS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: COMMITTEES DELAY PUTTING PROPOSAL BEFORE COUNCIL FOR FOUR WEEKS TO 
GIVE OPPONENTS TIME TO SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES.

<P>
Two Los Angeles City Council committees, after hearing two hours of vigorous 
debate, approved a controversial ordinance Monday to ban smoking in the city's 
8,600 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
However, the committees also voted to put off submitting the ordinance for 
consideration by the full council for at least four weeks to give opponents 
time to propose possible amendments that may lead to a less-restrictive law. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, ordinances adopted by committee are forwarded to the full council 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a special joint session, the council's Environmental Quality and Waste 
Management Committee and the Arts, Health and Humanities Committee approved the 
ban over the strenuous objections of restaurant owners and business groups. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, council members Marvin Braude, who sponsored the ordinance, 
Ruth Galanter and Joel Wachs heard from about two dozen opponents and 
supporters of the proposed ban, including Patrick Reynolds, the grandson of 
tobacco company magnate R. J. Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who abstained from voting, said he needed to see more 
evidence before he could believe either side's claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no more able to make a decision on this now than I was before the 
hearing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Braude agreed to delay a council hearing, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter 
voted for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of issues have been raised that I would like to grapple with," said 
Galanter, who has supported Braude's past anti-smoking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has ordinances -- all authored by Braude -- barring smoking in 
grocery stores, elevators and rooms where public meetings are being conducted, 
and requiring restaurants with seating for 50 or more people to set aside at 
least half the tables for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurateurs based their opposition to the latest proposal on the claim that 
smokers would not go out to eat if they could not also smoke. Several cited the 
experience of Beverly Hills, which enacted a complete ban on restaurant smoking 
when Los Angeles adopted its current law, only to rescind the measure when 
patronage fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned with the economic future of our institution," said Michael 
Taix, part owner of the venerable Les Freres Taix restaurant on Sunset 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beverly Hills experiment should illustrate how lethal this ban can be to 
our marginally profitable business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Cole of Restaurants for a Sensible Voluntary Policy, a coalition claiming 
200 member restaurants in Los Angeles, said the adequacy of the current law is 
demonstrated by the lack of public complaint. 
</P>
<P>
But Braude and other supporters of the measure said their position had little 
to do with diners' comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco smoke is a deadly carcinogen," Braude said. "It kills both smokers and 
nonsmokers." 
</P>
<P>
While the surgeon general estimates that tobacco kills 395,000 users a year, 
Braude said, "recent scientific disclosures indicate that at least 35,000 
nonsmoking Americans also die each year as a result of other people's smoking." 
</P>
<P>
The risk of lung cancer is 30 times as high for people highly exposed to 
second-hand smoke as for the nonsmoking general public, according to Dr. Wilbur 
Hallett of the USC Medical School and the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But Wachs said he was not convinced of the significance of smoke exposure from 
spending a few hours at a restaurant.

A proposal to ban smoking in all Los Angeles restaurants was approved by a City 
Council committee Monday over the protests of restaurant owners, who fear their 
businesses would be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
If the full council approves the measure, Los Angeles would become the first 
major city in the nation to impose such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial matter will be taken up in four to five weeks and council 
members expect heavy lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
"To say the very least, we are elated. But the tobacco industry is not going to 
take this lying down," said Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against 
Tobacco Smoke, a national lobbying organization. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has met with strong opposition from restaurant and business 
interests since it was proposed by Councilman Marvin Braude last May. 
</P>
<P>
But after a public hearing Monday, the measure was approved by a 3-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Braude, chairman of the Environmental Affairs Committee, and committee members 
Councilwomen Ruth Galanter and Joy Picus voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, chairman of the Arts, Health and Humanities Committee, 
which was invited who sat in onto the special hearing, cast the negative vote. 
He said he was not convinced that a few hours' exposure to smoke in a 
restaurant was significant and wanted more information before taking a final 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no more able to make a decision on this now than I was before the 
hearing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braude, the council's most tenacious anti-smoking crusader, used recent data on 
the health dangers of second-hand smoke to justify his push for the ban. "This 
proposal is crucial to protect the health of non-smokers from second-hand 
smoke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braude called tobacco smoke a "deadly carcinogen" that kills 35,000 non-smokers 
a year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Reynolds, a grandson of R. J. Reynolds, the founder of the giant 
tobacco company, also spoke in favor of the ban, saying that second-hand smoke 
causes cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is in and it's overwhelming," said Reynolds, who has broken with 
his family and now crusades against tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
Others who support the ban cited health considerations, both for restaurant 
patrons and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers opposed to the measure cited economic reasons, focusing on the 
experience of Beverly Hills, which enacted a ban on restaurant smoking only to 
rescind the measure when patronage fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Cole, executive vice president of Restaurants for a Sensible Voluntary 
Policy, said the ban would be "disastrous" for restaurant owners. "There is a 
direct relationship between dining and smoking for many people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dori Pye, president of the Los Angeles Business Council, argued that the 
measure would make the city seem "unfriendly" to the German and Japanese 
tourists. "These people like to smoke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of a restaurant that caters to Filipinos voiced a similar complaint. 
And Gerald Breitbart, a spokesman for the California Restaurant Assn. said the 
ban would hurt small restaurants in "ethnic communities" where many people 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether the full council will support the ban, by far the 
most stringent measure proposed by Braude since he began pushing for 
anti-smoking proposals 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has ordinances -- all authored by Braude -- barring smoking in 
grocery stores, elevators and rooms where public meetings are being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Braude-sponsored law that was enacted in 1987, restaurants with more 
than 50 seats must set aside as least half of them for non-smokers. Smaller 
restaurants are exempt from the law.

<P>
DROUGHT BLAMED AS ANIMALS RAID CAMPS AT INCREASING RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bears in the Angeles National Forest are entering campgrounds and other 
recreation areas with increasing frequency, possibly forced deeper into human 
habitats by drought to forage for food, U.S. Forest Service officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Biologist Bill Brown said Monday he has noticed the trend in the last 
four to five years and believes it is linked to the lack of rain during that 
period. What's more, Brown said, once a bear discovers a convenient source of 
food it will develop the memory of an elephant -- returning again and again for 
the easy pickings. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the drought, there's probably a reduction in the available berries 
and rodents and ground squirrels they normally prey on," said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is all strictly speculation at this point," he added, joining other 
forest officials in laying part of the blame on careless humans who leave 
behind trash, food-laden picnic tables and ice chests. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Paulek, field supervisor for the state Department of Fish and Game's 
regional office in Long Beach, said, "the drought has certainly had some 
effect." But, he added, "bears are opportunists and if there are easy food 
sources, they will take advantage of them." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the Pyramid Lake, Crystal Lake, and Jackson Lake recreation areas 
of the Angeles National Forest appear to be most popular among the estimated 50 
to 200 California black bears that live in the 650,000-acre forest, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries to humans have been reported in the Angeles National Forest. In the 
San Bernardino Forest, however, a bear bit a 10-year-old boy on the hand last 
month as he slept on a cot outdoors. Paulek said the boy may have had something 
sweet smeared on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers and concessionaries have been forced to destroy several persistent 
bears in the last couple of years, including the one in the San Bernardino 
Forest and another last month at Verdugo Pines Camp near Wrightwood, in the 
Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Mitchell, who has managed the camp with her husband, Stuart, for 10 
years, said it was the first time they were forced to kill a bear "and we're 
sorry we had to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Rangers cited several feats of bears' strength and intelligence, including an 
instance last month at Crystal Lake in which a bear attempted to tear the 
hatchback off a car to reach a picnic cooler. 
</P>
<P>
Bears quickly learn to equate coolers and other types of containers with easy 
food and have been known to mistake cans of tennis balls for containers of 
potato chips, forest officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pyramid Lake recreation center about nine miles south of Gorman, 
concessionaire Chet Roberts said bears have returned repeatedly to his snack 
bar for hamburger and ice cream, amazing and frustrating him with their 
ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
"They have torn off doors, ripped off the actual siding of the building, ripped 
off window frames, ripped off the air-conditioning unit and crawled through the 
hole," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have also removed the exhaust system from the snack bar roof and ripped 
off the doors of our ice chest probably six to eight times," he continued. "On 
one evening they ate about sixty pounds of hamburger meat and about $100 worth 
of ice cream. They're particularly fond of our hamburgers though." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said snack bar employees came to work one morning to find that a 
motorist had spent the night on the roof. The man had car trouble and ran into 
a bear while looking for a phone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year veteran of the lake, Roberts said he has noticed bears growing bolder 
over the last few years. But the frequency of bear sightings and raids appears 
to have doubled between last year and this summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger John Seales, who manages the Crystal Lake Recreation Area, said the 
number of bear "incidents" has tripled since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The drought -- that's the basic answer I get from most experts," said Seales. 
"The drought is driving them to where people are. They normally don't like to 
be around people." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Stewart, a biology professor at Cal Poly Pomona and a bear expert, said 
the drought theory is plausible because his studies show that most bears prefer 
natural sources of food -- acorns, manzanita berries and choke cherries among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can demonstrate an increase in this sort of thing, it's hard to see 
anything else going on out there that's different," said Stewart. "This drought 
thing is a likely possibility."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FARRELL AIDES SUE HIS FOES, CHARGING 
SLANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell's aides filed a $1-million 
slander suit Monday against three of Farrell's political opponents who had 
raised questions about the propriety of his hiring of the aides. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court suit was filed by Marcela Howell, who managed Farrell's 
unsuccessful Assembly race in June, and Anthony Thigpenn, who worked for the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Kerman Maddox, Otha Johnson and Gee Martin slandered and 
libeled Howell and Thigpenn when they suggested that Farrell's hiring of the 
two "represented a political payoff and a misuse of public funds," said 
attorney Melanie Lomax, who represents Howell and Thigpenn. 
</P>
<P>
The two were recently hired for a total of $25,000 to work in Farrell's office. 
The councilman still owes them money for their campaign work. Maddox, who has 
said he will challenge Farrell for his 8th District seat next year, made the 
"patronage" allegation at a recent news conference. He was unavailable for 
comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 14-YEAR-OLD BOY, SHOT BY FRIEND IN 
ACCIDENT, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy who was accidentally shot by a friend last week as they 
played with a gun died early Monday of his wounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as Donnell Arsene, was shot in the head late Thursday with 
a small-caliber revolver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arsene and a group of youths were playing with the weapon outside the boy's 
home on East 80th Street in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Arsene died at 6:05 a.m. Monday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, 
Detective James Harper said. Harper said that while the investigation 
continues, all indications so far are that the shooting was accidental and no 
charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the witnesses corroborate each other's statements," Harper said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BEATING OF COUPLE IN FRONT OF CROWD PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating a weekend melee in 
Palmdale in which a group of men beat a man and a woman while a crowd looked on 
in a parking lot where teen-agers congregate on weekends, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Houtz, 22, was cut and bruised when he was beaten and kicked by about 
eight men during the attack at 12:30 a.m. Saturday, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
His girlfriend, Rebecca Campbell, 21, suffered cuts, bruises and a broken 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
The altercation began when several men harassed and pinched her as she and 
Houtz were leaving a bar, Campbell said. Words and then blows were exchanged, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials discounted reports that some in the crowd of about 100 
cheered during the attack, though they said no one came to the couple's aid and 
some onlookers joined the fray when Campbell's car grazed a teen-age girl as 
Campbell tried to get help for Houtz.

An anonymous donor has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to Dr. 
Steven Ray Stoltz, the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center surgical intern who has been 
missing since setting out on a mountain bike ride Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police announced the reward Sunday after weekend searches turned up 
no trace of Stoltz, 25, an experienced cyclist and triathlon competitor who was 
believed to have been heading into the Topanga Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, teams of volunteers combed bike and hiking paths along the Santa 
Monica Mountains in the western San Fernando Valley, said Beverly Hartunian, 
the mother of another physician at Cedars-Sinai who is helping to coordinate

$1.3 BILLION IN CLAIMS FILED OVER KILLING BY DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for the family of an innocent bystander killed by a sheriff's deputy 
three months ago filed $1.3 billion in claims against Los Angeles County on 
Monday, saying she hopes the large request will force authorities to end 
excessive police force in poor communities. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the Los Angeles FBI office said it opened an 
investigation Monday into the May 15 shooting death of Gianna Blue, who was 
killed as she shopped at a liquor store on Central Avenue at Century Blvd. on 
the edge of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said he could not divulge details of the 
investigation, which had been requested by the lawyer for Blue's family, but 
acknowledged that paper work to formally begin the probe had arrived Monday 
from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the lawyer, Geraldine Green, filed 18 claims against the county 
on behalf of Blue's four young children, her parents and siblings, plus the 
owner of the liquor store, three employees and another customer. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on the steps of the county Hall of Administration, Green 
accused the two deputies involved in the incident that led to Blue's death of 
disregarding the safety of innocent people and the Sheriff's Department of 
frequent and deadly brutalization of residents of poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of Watts and South Los Angeles are being killed by police," Green 
said. "There have been million-dollar claims made before, but apparently 
(county officials) just pay that out of petty cash and it's business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Green said she was referring to recent reports in The Times that showed the 
county had paid $8.5 million during a three-year period as a result of 
brutality lawsuits against deputies. Most of the victims of excessive force by 
the Sheriff's Department are poor, Green contended. 
</P>
<P>
If the county fails to respond to the claims within 45 days or rejects them, 
Green said she will she will file suit in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzales said the department would make no statement 
about the case because the matter is in litigation. Other county officials 
reserved comment, saying they had not seen the claims. 
</P>
<P>
Blue, who had turned 30 the day she was killed, was buying things for her 
birthday party, already in progress at her nearby home, when Deputies Shannon 
Larren and Thomas Drake ran up to the entrance of the store and fired a volley 
of shots at a man they said had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies, both five-year veterans, told investigators their target was 
Hernandez Vincson, 24, who they contended had run from them into the store then 
pointed a gun at them. Vincson was shot several times, but survived. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at first suggested that Vincson shot Blue, but ballistics tests 
showed that the fatal bullet came from a deputy's gun, having passed through 
Vincson's arm. 
</P>
<P>
In filing the claims, Green cited what she said was the deputies' failure to 
identify themselves or shout out a warning to those inside the store before 
opening fire.

INTRUDER KILLS TWO IN SOUTH L.A. HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regina Nolan's efforts to shun a lifestyle of drug abuse were cut short Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives found Nolan, 29, lying on her front stoop, bleeding to death from a 
shotgun wound inflicted by an intruder in her South Los Angeles home. 
Authorities found another murder victim, an acquaintance of Nolan's, inside the 
house in the 300 block of 70th Street. The 36-year-old Los Angeles man's name 
was withheld until his family could be notified of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors and Nolan's family said they watched in pain as the 29-year-old, 
unemployed X-ray technician struggled to keep her distance from crack cocaine 
and those who accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept Regina close, because we wanted to help her come around," one of 
Nolan's three brothers who live in the neighborhood said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we saw it, there's no use in . . . trying to step around it, our 
sister had a problem, and the family all wanted to see it through," said the 
brother, who declined to identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators were looking into a possible connection between the 
murders and an earlier incident in which a friend of Nolan's was severely 
beaten after leaving the house. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza Bordenabe, 30, said police questioned her about an assailant who 
struck her in the face and broke her wrist the night before the shooting. 
Bordenabe said she had left Nolan's home and was returning to her house a few 
doors away on 70th Street when she was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The man killed on Sunday had fended off the assailant, Bordenabe told police, 
but she added that she did not know if there was any connection between the 
assault and the double-murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with Regina," she said. "We were more or less like family. But I 
stopped going over to that house all the time because it got so violent." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's brother said that the house, which is owned by Nolan's mother, had 
become the focus of flare-ups between family members and those thought to be 
hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
"Regina's what you call a pushover," he said. "The people who came around 
brought problems with them. Regina had her TV stolen; they would take her 
clothes. But she was quiet about it. She was the kind of girl who, when she 
wants people to leave her house, can't come out and tell them." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Nolan had been spending more time with her children, Marcus, 5, and 
Marquitta, 7, who have been in the care of their grandmother since Nolan began 
using cocaine, her brother said. 
</P>
<P>
"Regina would take Marcus to nursery school and then to the day-care center," 
he said. "She was staying in more, trying to stay out of trouble."

ANTON SAYS HE BACKS PROPOSALS FOR MORE CONTROL AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school Supt. William Anton said Monday he will recommend approval 
of proposals to give 27 schools more autonomy despite concerns raised by some 
Board of Education members that more multicultural programs are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Anton said some of the proposals were not as visionary as he might have hoped, 
but he praised others for their innovation. "Change may be uncomfortable . . . 
and there may be some reluctance," Anton said at Monday's school board meeting. 
But he added that "all of us are committed to making it work." 
</P>
<P>
In their first public discussion of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
experiment in what is being called school-based management, most board members 
said they favor approving plans submitted by the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to allow these experiments to flourish," said board member Mark 
Slavkin. "There's a tremendous risk in doing nothing and . . . a school is 
going to know much sooner than we are if it's working and whether they need to 
make modifications." 
</P>
<P>
Several board members raised concerns about the lack of multicultural programs, 
proposals by individual schools that might adversely affect other schools, and 
schools that had failed to define academic goals. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Walters, the most vociferous critic of school-based management, said she 
will not approve the proposals until substantial revisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
Walters voiced special concern that some of the proposals failed to address the 
needs of multicultural student bodies, faulting one proposal for assuming that 
all students of one race learn alike. 
</P>
<P>
She also blasted a school that wanted to add popular, non-core classes, saying 
that "inner-city kids don't need any more Mickey Mouse classes and Mickey Mouse 
graduation requirements." She did not name the schools whose plans she 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, said board member Leticia Quezada, is that the plans lack 
specific strategies to help low-income and non-English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a lot of specifics on what we're going to accomplish and how," 
Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jackie Goldberg reminded her colleagues that the basic 
philosophy behind school-based management entails relinquishing control and 
giving schools the freedom to try new and localized programs -- even programs 
that board members may not agree with. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we don't philosophically agree, if they set improved standards, then 
we can see if it works," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plans, which could be implemented in September if approved by 
the board and the directors of the United Teachers-Los Angeles union, range 
from adding district-approved programs, such as after-school tutoring and 
parent volunteer groups, to radical changes in what students study and how they 
are evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal calls for students to perform 10 hours of community or school 
service in order to graduate. Another would create two classrooms where 
children are mixed across grade levels and allowed to learn without the 
pressure of grades. 
</P>
<P>
Several representatives of the teacher's union urged the board not to pick 
apart the proposals but to recognize the hard work of the 27 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these proposals are very far-reaching but we have to make a very clear 
philosophical statement . . . to back them up," said Nina Greenberg, elementary 
schools vice president for the teacher's union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to make a mistake and do something than continue to do nothing," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
The board asked its staff to recommend how to address some of the concerns that 
were raised Monday. The board is expected to decide whether to approve the 
proposals at its meeting next Monday. The proposals have been approved by the 
Central Council on Shared Decision Making and School-Based Management. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposals will require the board to grant waivers of district 
policy and several will require waivers from the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy of the district's 600 schools were selected last spring to develop 
plans. The schools had barely a month to prepare the proposals and only 38 were 
able to submit plans by the July 16 deadline. Eleven of those were deemed 
incomplete and will proably be revised and resubmitted in October, along with 
the remaining 32 from the original group.

HIGH-SPEED RAIL BACKERS SEEK HELP; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: CONSORTIUM APPEALS TO COUNTY AFTER RIDERSHIP PROJECTIONS ARE CUT IN 
HALF. LINE IS TO RUN FROM LAX TO PALMDALE. 
</P>

<P>
The consortium proposing to build a high-speed rail line between Los Angeles 
International Airport and Palmdale, a $1-billion project that was to be 
privately financed, Monday asked for financial support from the county because 
ridership estimates have been reduced by almost half. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a request from the consortium, a panel of the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission on Monday recommended consideration of public funding 
for the proposed 69-mile line. One county official said the potential bill 
could reach $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout came after the project's backers reduced ridership projections 
for the line's first segment -- the 36 miles from Los Angeles Airport to Santa 
Clarita -- from 100,000 riders a day to about 55,000, with a corresponding drop 
in expected revenues, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Chiaverini, a spokesman for the consortium, acknowledged the reduction 
in ridership estimates, although he could not confirm the precise numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium apparently had earlier overestimated the number of bus riders 
who might make connections with the train, said Linda Bohlinger, director of 
capital planning and programming for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation panel's meeting Monday produced the first public indication 
that the proposed rail line -- which would use futuristic magnetic levitation 
technology to reach speeds up to 100 m.p.h -- might not be entirely privately 
financed. Its backers are seeking approval for the project under an 
experimental state privatization program for transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
However, consortium and county officials said the project could still go 
forward with local public funding, because the state requires only that no 
state or federal funds be used. State officials in mid-September are to choose 
up to four such projects out of eight submitted statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Bohlinger said county officials are willing to consider local funding. Based on 
preliminary projections, the public's obligation could approach $100 million a 
year for up to 15 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bohlinger said the consortium's own projections showed that public funding 
could amount to one-third to one-half of the line's total operating and 
construction costs for the first 15 years. Only at that point, she said, was 
the line projected to become self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission and our executive director want to portray the message that 
we're looking at this very positively," Bohlinger said. "They're not dismissing 
this out of hand. They're willing to look at the possibility of the commission 
being financially involved." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's Finance and Programming Committee voted 5 to 0 Monday to 
explore public funding options, including possible contributions from the 
commission, the city of Los Angeles and the city's Department of Airports.

SURROGATE MOTHER SUES TO KEEP COUPLE'S CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTODY: THE ORANGE COUNTY CASE IS A FIRST INVOLVING A SURROGATE WITH NO 
GENETIC LINK TO FETUS. 
</P>

<P>
In an unprecedented case that raises new questions about the rights of 
surrogate mothers, an Orange County woman who agreed to carry another couple's 
child filed suit on Monday, claiming that she should keep the baby even though 
she has no genetic link to it. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by Anna Johnson, the surrogate mother who is seven months' 
pregnant, marks the first time in the nation that a judge is being asked to 
decide whether a birth mother has the right to call a child her own when it is 
the product of another couple's sperm and egg. Previous court cases have 
involved contracts in which a surrogate mother's own egg was fertilized through 
artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you donate a sperm and an egg doesn't make you a parent," said 
Richard C. Gilbert, one of Johnson's lawyers. "She is not just a machine, an 
incubator. Where do souls come from? The egg? The sperm? The birth mother? What 
passes through that placenta? Anna is as important a biological parent as any 
other biological donor in this case." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute highlights the wrenching questions that can develop on the cutting 
edges of science. In this case, medical advances gave an infertile couple the 
chance to have a child of their own, by uniting their sperm and egg in a 
laboratory through the process of in-vitro fertilization, and implanting the 
embryo in another woman's uterus. But no law exists to assure the couple that 
they can claim the baby once it is born. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, a licensed vocational nurse and a single mother, agreed in January 
to bear a child for Mark and Cris Calvert, an Orange County couple, for 
$10,000. Now, she says, they have breached the contract by making late 
payments, failing to buy life insurance for her, and by not caring adequately 
for her and the fetus. Johnson claims that their actions amount to "fetal 
neglect," and feels that she should keep the child. 
</P>
<P>
"This child is not genetically mine, but I have more feelings for him than the 
natural parents do," Johnson said in an interview last week. "If they are 
distant and uncaring now, what are they going to be like when he comes?" 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calvert, 34, an insurance underwriter, and Cris Calvert, 36, a registered 
nurse, reject Johnson's account, saying that they have fulfilled all their 
promises and have done more than the contract required to care for Johnson. 
They claim that Johnson has tried to exploit them financially and emotionally, 
demanding payments early and threatening to keep the baby if she did not get 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Her contacts with us have been just a series of demands, complaints and 
misrepresentations," Mark Calvert said in an interview. "We drove her to 
doctor's appointments, gave her money, brought her food, asked how she was 
doing. We did even more than we were required to do." 
</P>
<P>
After the Calverts had complied with Johnson's demands to have two $2,000 
payments made at least a month ahead of schedule, she wrote them a letter on 
July 23 demanding the rest of the $10,000, even though most of it was not due 
until after her October delivery date, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation can go two ways," the letter said. "One, you can pay me the 
entire sum early, or two, you can forget about helping me out, calling it a 
breach of contract, and not get the baby." 
</P>
<P>
The famous Baby M case in New Jersey brought surrogacy to widespread public 
attention in 1986, but that was a case in which the surrogate, Mary Beth 
Whitehead Gould, had her own egg fertilized with the sperm of William Stern, so 
she was genetically the mother of the child. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Supreme Court held that surrogacy contracts are illegal because 
they amount to baby-selling. Custody was awarded to the baby's biological 
father, Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth, but Whitehead Gould was given 
visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
In-vitro fertilization produced the first "test-tube baby" in England in 1978. 
It has been only in the last five or six years that the technology has been 
used in surrogacy arrangements. Most surrogacies are achieved through 
artificial insemination using the surrogate's egg. 
</P>
<P>
Gary N. Skoloff, the lawyer who represented the Sterns, said he doubts that 
Johnson will win parental rights to the child in her womb because it was not 
made from her genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she has a much weaker case than Mary Beth Whitehead had, because you 
have that extra step of distance," Skoloff said. "But you have this heavy-duty 
emotional argument of a woman claiming a child she bore. Who knows where it 
will lead?" 
</P>
<P>
Skoloff said the dispute demonstrates the need for national legislation on the 
issue of surrogacy. The Baby M ruling is not binding outside New Jersey, 
because the case was never heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. At least seven 
states have outlawed surrogacy contracts. California is among the states that 
have no law on the issue. Several measures have been introduced in the state 
Legislature to legalize and to criminalize surrogacy contracts, but none has 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he will seek to have the contract declared invalid and illegal 
because it constitutes baby-selling. He also hopes to establish that it takes 
more than genetic material to convey the title of parent. 
</P>
<P>
Christian R. Van Deusen, the attorney for the Calverts, said he will seek to 
enforce the custody rights laid out in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"That child is biologically Cris' and Mark's," he said. "That contract is legal 
and valid. (Johnson) is a physiological parent, no question about it. But the 
genetic parents have more right to the baby than she does. Genetics are the 
property of the parents who provided them." 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen said that regardless of who is deemed to be the baby's parent, 
custody will be awarded by a judge who must determine what is in the best 
interests of the baby. The surrogacy contract allows for that judicial 
decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney H. Joseph Gitlin, who heads the surrogacy committee of the American 
Bar Assn.'s family law section, said he believes that surrogacy contracts must 
be legalized. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reality," he said. "People are going to do it. It's like birth control, 
or abortion. There's a real need. People are desperate to have children." 
</P>
<P>
William W. Handel, an attorney whose Beverly Hills-based Center for Surrogate 
Parenting is the state's leading broker of surrogate agreements, said the 
Johnson dispute points up the need for extensive screening of potential 
surrogates. Painful rifts between the parties are rare, he said, and should not 
be used to argue against surrogacy arrangements, most of which go smoothly and 
benefit everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you ever get something that doesn't hurt someone when change is under 
way?" said Handel, whose standard surrogacy contract was used in the Johnson 
case. "But the benefits far outweigh the risks. This is a real alternative for 
infertile couples." 
</P>
<P>
Cris Calvert cannot carry a baby because uterine tumors forced removal of her 
womb. So she and her husband, who have been married eight years, were 
interested in surrogate parenting. Cris and Anna work at the same hospital and 
were introduced by a nurse who knew that Anna had expressed an interest in 
being a surrogate mother. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Calverts and Johnson met. They arranged for Johnson to have 
medical and psychological evaluations. An infertility specialist affiliated 
with UC Irvine used drugs to synchronize the women's menstrual cycles. On Jan. 
19, he placed three fertilized eggs in Johnson's uterus. One survived. 
</P>
<P>
According to both sides, everything went well for a while. The Calverts called 
Johnson, brought her flowers and fresh fruit, took her to medical appointments. 
But when Johnson was hospitalized with severe, persistent nausea and 
dehydration, and two more times for early contractions, she felt the Calverts 
were "bent out of shape" and "not very understanding." 
</P>
<P>
She said Mark even refused to take her to the hospital once, suggesting that 
she take a taxi instead. He said he has no recollection of that and never would 
have refused such a request. Cris Calvert says that she and Mark were very 
worried and did everything they could. She even brought Johnson home-cooked egg 
rolls and noodles, food she loved. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said things worsened as payments began coming late and her 
financial situation began deteriorating. The Calverts insist they paid early, 
and that they have canceled checks to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also complained that the $200,000 life insurance policy promised in the 
contract never materialized. The Calverts' insurance agent visited her but 
offered her only $100,000 and said she would have to pay the premiums, Johnson 
said. Mark Calvert said that was a misunderstanding, because he instructed his 
agent to offer $200,000 and to bill him. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the Calverts said, they began to worry about how she spent the 
money they gave her. When she demanded the second $2,000 early, Mark commented 
that it had not been long since the last payment. He said that Johnson told him 
she had bought new furniture for her 3-year-old daughter and a new 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she was having genuine physical problems with her pregnancy and 
needed the couple's help and support. But the Calverts said they don't know 
what to believe. The first time Johnson went to the hospital with contractions, 
the hospital monitor detected nothing, they said. And they noted that Johnson's 
doctor wanted her to check into the hospital for a three-week stress-related 
psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts said they were overcome by Johnson's repeated phone calls in which 
she complained about feeling bad, blamed them for having "lost her girlish 
figure" and threatened to deliver the baby early. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson feels the Calverts were callous. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have showed more genuine care and concern," she said. "It's a 
human thing. It wasn't that much to expect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FERTILIZATION TECHNIQUES 
</P>
<P>
Surrogacy arrangements can be achieved through various fertilization 
techniques. These methods can also be used by infertile couples without a 
surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
Through artificial insemination. The surrogate mother is inseminated with the 
sperm of the male who has hired her. This is the most common form of surrogacy. 
Fertilization takes place inside the surrogate mother's body and uses her own 
egg, so the surrogate is genetically related to the baby she carries. 
</P>
<P>
Through in vitro fertilization. The sperm and egg of a couple are united in a 
laboratory, then implanted in the uterus of a surrogate mother. This is far 
less common. Fertilization takes place outside the body and uses no genetic 
material from the surrogate mother, so she is not biologically related to the 
baby she carries. 
</P>
<P>
Through GIFT (gamete intrafallopian transfer). The egg of the surrogate and the 
sperm of the male are harvested and placed in a surrogate woman's Fallopian 
tube, where fertilization takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Another form of infertility assistance can also result in a woman carrying a 
baby to which she is not genetically related, although no surrogate is used. In 
the egg donor method, a woman supplies an egg to a woman who cannot produce her 
own eggs. That egg is fertilized in the laboratory with the sperm of the 
infertile woman's husband, then implanted into her uterus. She is not a 
surrogate mother because she keeps the baby, but only her husband and the donor 
are related to it genetically.

CAEN-DEMNED: San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, never a fan of 
Southern California culture, included a dig at Orange County in his Monday 
column. . . . Caen asked three Bay Area men who had recently returned from 
driving through all 58 California counties which county was the worst. Their 
opinion: Orange or El Dorado. . . . "All those yuppie west side Tahoe towns are 
indistinguishable from the paved-over ennui of Irvine," they concluded. "You've

TICKETS, PLEASE: The Irvine Barclay Theatre is giving new meaning to the term 
"advance sales." . . . Tickets are already available for the 750-seat theater 
on the edge of the UC Irvine campus, even though it's still under construction. 
Because the theater is the size of a small Broadway playhouse, "we encourage 
people to purchase their tickets early to make sure they get seats," says UCI's 
Barbara Davidson. . . . The first performance, Nov. 2, will feature the Bella 
Lewitzky Dance Co. introducing a dance honoring UCI's 25th anniversary.

ACTIVITY AROUND BASES STEPPED UP

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troop activity around Orange County's two military installations intensified 
Monday as thousands of Marines prepared to leave at a moment's notice to join 
the U.S.-led military operation in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Although military officials declined to specify exactly when troops would 
leave, a woman who declined to be identified said Monday that her husband, a 
Marine based in Tustin, was told that at least two squadrons from the Tustin 
Marine Corps Helicopter Station would be leaving Thursday for Saudi Arabia. The 
wife of another Tustin Marine said Monday that her husband has been sent to the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, where she said he is to be deployed by the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 Orange County-based Marines will be joining the stream of U.S. 
troops converging on the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield, a military 
source said Sunday. The source added Sunday that the Marines would begin 
leaving within the next 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials in Washington and in Southern California remained silent 
Monday about troop-movement details. They would confirm only that the Southern 
California troops being deployed include parts of the 7th Marine Expeditionary 
Brigade and the 1st Force Service Support Group in Twentynine Palms, the 1st 
Marine Division from Camp Pendleton, and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing based at 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The Tustin base is attached to the El 
Toro wing. 
</P>
<P>
"They have begun movement to embarkation points for deployment," Marine Corps 
spokesman Randy Gaddo said Monday from Washington. "There is no time line for 
when they get there," that is, to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Marines will be embarking from Norton Air Force Base in 
San Bernardino County and from the El Toro base, military sources said. Most of 
the cargo and troop-carrying helicopters from Tustin will be sent by ship, a 
military source said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Sam Grizzle said Monday that nationally, the 
deployments were being carried out smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of forces is ahead of schedule," Grizzle said. "Everything is 
going just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lt. Gene Browne of the El Toro base would not comment on troop 
movements, a hint of the intensified activity came Monday in a press release he 
issued warning that there will be more noise around the base "intermittently 24 
hours a day" until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
"The extended airfield operating hours are necessary due to operational 
commitments," Browne said in the press release, but he did not elaborate on 
that. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County Monday, military personnel were getting their personal affairs 
in order and assuring worried relatives that everything would be all right. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I'm worried about is I won't be around for the birth of my 
child," lamented one Tustin Marine corporal, whose wife's due date is Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Another Tustin Marine corporal, who would not say whether he is being deployed, 
conceded that none of the wives are happy about their husbands' leaving. "But 
they realize that this is part of the job," the Marine said as helicopter 
transports were roaring overhead in practice runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine added that there is an air of tension at the Tustin and El Toro 
bases that is heightened by the fact that most of the soldiers there are young 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"This is their first big international conflict, and they're a little scared 
and anxious," the Marine said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Sgt. Larry Williams was dressed in full camouflage gear and heavy 
black boots as he emptied the trash and touched up his lawn Monday morning in 
the military housing complex behind the El Toro station. Williams, 29, lives 
there with his wife and two young daughters. He acknowledged that he was "on 
alert" but declined to discuss the details. He said he is prepared for the 
roller-coaster of emotions that comes with deployment. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, you have a feeling you're ready to go. That's what I joined the 
Marine Corps for," Williams said. "And then when you get to the area -- the 
theater of operation -- you kind of have second thoughts. I guess that's when 
the fear comes into you, but you get over it."

Williams said he served as part of the U.S. peacekeeping mission deployed to 
Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983. On the Sunday morning that suicide terrorists bombed 
the Marine Corp barracks there, killing 260 men, he had been sent on temporary 
assignment elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He lost about 20 of the men in his company that day. 
</P>
<P>
"I did lose a lot of my friends . . , but I guess it just wasn't my time to 
go," Williams said. He added that memories of the tragedy make him more eager 
to return. "It's almost like a vendetta for all my buddies. I feel it would be 
a chance to get back." 
</P>
<P>
A few streets over, Linda Sexton, 34, was sitting on her porch in a quiet 
cul-de-sac of the El Toro neighborhood, still awaiting word on whether her 
husband will be going. Sexton's husband is a major in the Marines. She said she 
has been a military wife for 10 years, but that she has never experienced the 
sense of fear that now pervades her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Sexton noted that she, like most of her neighbors, is too young to remember 
much about the war in Vietnam, the last time U.S. troops were engaged in major, 
long-term combat. Other deployments such as the one to Grenada did not create 
the same sense of foreboding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so much bigger. The whole world is getting involved," Sexton said. 
"This is the first time we're really feeling the fear that there's something 
our husbands may become involved in. We're all waiting to see who will be 
called next." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, families of Marines not summoned in the current deployment were 
counting their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy because we were scared they were going to call him," said the wife 
of a Marine helicopter mechanic who this past weekend discovered that he will 
be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Although the actual deployment is still reportedly days away, businesses 
dependent on local Marines were already feeling the effects Monday. At The Barn 
Restaurant and Saloon in Tustin, for example, manager/owner Cynthy Gravitt said 
her lunch business was suffering from a lack of Marine patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, we have as many as 30 Marines here for lunch," Gravitt said, "but we 
just haven't had any in the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
At Knowl-Wood Home of The World's Best Hamburger in Irvine, assistant manager 
Cindy Enriquez also reported a sharp drop in business from the nearby El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are very slow," Enriquez said Monday. "By 1 p.m., usually we have 
1,600 customers, but today we had only 1,100. So I feel our business definitely 
has been affected." 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez added that one of her waitresses had to take the day off Monday 
because her husband, a Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, 
received orders to ship out within the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"She's on her way home finding out what's going on," Enriquez said. "She's 
really upset. The rest of us are, too. In fact, that's all the talk around here 
right now."

DUELING MEASURES CONFOUND OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the City Council's decision last week to place a measure on the 
Nov. 6 ballot to rival an activist group's beach-and-park preservation 
initiative, city attorneys are now trying to figure out what would happen if 
voters approve both measures. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Hutton said she plans to seek an opinion from the state attorney general's 
office to clarify the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative proposed by Save Our Parks, a grass-roots group that collected 
more than 15,000 voter signatures to qualify the measure, would bar the sale or 
lease of city parkland or beach land without voter approval. The rival 
proposal, which four council members voted to place on the ballot Friday just 
hours before the filing deadline, restricts sales but would allow leasing of 
parkland or beach land for development without a citywide referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton and other legal experts say they believe that, should both proposals be 
approved, the measure garnering the most votes would win, as is the case with 
competing state initiatives. But because the measures are proposed amendments 
to the city charter -- which carries with it a unique set of laws and 
guidelines -- some lawyers believe the matter is not so clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Counsel Arthur C. Wahlstedt Jr. said he believes the same 
guidelines that govern state measures would apply to city charter amendment 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"If the two could be harmonized," Wahlstedt said, "it's possible that both 
could be passed. . . . But I'm not absolutely certain. I don't have a lot of 
experience with charters, so I hesitate to respond to something on city 
charters." JOHN PENNER

SCHOOL TRUSTEE SELECTION TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two weeks of interviewing candidates to fill a vacancy on the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District board, trustees are scheduled today to decide 
who their new colleague will be. 
</P>
<P>
Board members plan to interview seven finalists from an original field of 16 
candidates before appointing a replacement for David Warfield, who resigned in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the original candidates showed up for interviews at last week's 
board meeting to explain their educational philosophies and why they want to 
become trustees. Board members will query the remaining candidates on more 
detailed issues at Tuesday's meeting, scheduled for 7 p.m. at district offices.

CAMPAIGN COFFERS NOT OVERFLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With three City Council incumbents declining to run for reelection this year, 
city election campaign fund raising has been unusually inactive during the 
first half of 1990, according to candidates' financial disclosure forms 
submitted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
No council member or candidate reported raising more than $6,500 from January 
through June, although four seats will be contested in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of contributions was so slow that Councilwoman Grace Winchell, who 
traditionally runs tight-budget, grass-roots campaigns, was one of the top two 
money gatherers during the first six months of the year, collecting $6,475, 
according to her financial statement. That total was equaled by Councilman John 
Erskine, who announced Friday that he will not seek reelection when his term 
expires in November. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's latest contributions brought her total donations during the past 
fiscal year to $8,475, according to her statement. By July 1, five months 
before the election, she reported having $4,866 in her campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Winchell's contributions came from individuals, including several 
leading organizers of the city's environmental activist groups. The only 
business or organization from which she reported receiving money was Amigos de 
Bolsa Chica, which gave $300. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine reported raising $10,559 since July, 1989, with only the $6,475 he 
raised during 1990 left in his campaign chest. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine, who has not said what he intends to do with his remaining campaign 
money, collected at least $1,275 from development-oriented businesses or 
individuals, according to his financial reports. Another $900 of his 
contributions came from four enterprises or individuals connected with Rainbow 
Disposal Co., the city's rubbish collector. Rainbow interests also gave $375 to 
Winchell. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays and Councilmen Wes Bannister, both of whose terms expire 
in November, are forgoing the council race to run for statewide offices. Mays 
is the Republican nominee for an Assembly seat that represents much of 
Huntington Beach and Long Beach. Bannister is the GOP candidate for state 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Mays reported transferring $23,780 from his council campaign coffers to his 
Assembly race fund, as allowed under state campaign financing regulations. 
Before closing out his council fund, he reported raising $4,215, composed 
chiefly of donations less than $100 and a $1,500 contribution from a Los 
Angeles-based political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister reported raising no money for his council fund during the past fiscal 
year, ending June with $306 in his coffers. He did not report having 
transferred any residual council funds to his state campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Silva, whose term runs until November, 1992, reported collecting 
$1,600 during the first half of 1990, including $1,000 from four Red Onion 
Restaurant officials. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. Green nor Councilman Don MacAllister, both of 
whom also have two years left in their council terms, reported raising any 
money during the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Two challengers for council seats, Linda Moulton-Patterson and Anthony 
Passammante, have established campaign funds, but neither reported raising any 
money during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, City Attorney Gail C. Hutton, who under the City Charter must face 
election every four years, reported no fund-raising activity the first six 
months of the year, but collected $32,665 during the last half of 1989. By the 
end of June, however, she reported having depleted her campaign fund. Hutton is 
being challenged this year by Santa Ana-based attorney Paul Eugene Mann. JOHN

RENOVATION GUIDES EXPECTED TO BE OKD

<P>
After months of delay, the Anaheim City Council tonight is scheduled to give 
final approval to ordinances that would establish new design guidelines and 
zone changes for the commercial recreation area around Disneyland and the 
Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are the result of more than a year of study by city officials 
seeking to renovate the aged tourist area and make it more appealing for 
continued growth. 
</P>
<P>
While city and Disneyland officials laud the changes as overdue improvements to 
the area, some developers and small business owners have been concerned that 
the new plans are too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
Existing businesses and new projects that have already been approved will not 
be immediately subject to the new guidelines. However, business owners oppose a 
provision that calls for putting up smaller signs in the crowded commercial 
area within the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
And developers are upset about a provision that would bar certain future 
businesses, such as fast-food restaurants, convenience stores and Laundromats. 
</P>
<P>
Existing landowners object to the fact that if they remodel or sell their 
property, they will have to give up portions of it to create larger setbacks 
from the street. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearby residents have complained that the changes may make the 
area look better, but they do nothing to reduce the noise and traffic produced 
during the hectic tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is a building moratorium in the commercial recreation area, a 
1,040-acre zone roughly bounded by the Santa Ana Freeway, Orangewood Avenue, 
Ball Road and Walnut Street. The moratorium will expire in September unless it 
is renewed or amended. That date will coincide with the date the new ordinances 
-- if approved tonight -- will take effect. LISA MASCARO

ACCIDENT FORCES FREEWAY CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway were temporarily closed Monday 
after a truck driver apparently made an unsafe lane change and triggered a 
four-vehicle collision, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old San Pedro woman and her 8-month-old infant received minor 
injuries in the accident, which occurred about 11:25 a.m. north of the Harbor 
Boulevard off-ramp, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident apparently started when William P. Maggs, 37, of Phoenix clipped 
the back of a Hyundai sedan with his flatbed trailer truck while changing 
lanes, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting the Hyundai, Maggs drifted into another lane into the path of a 
gasoline truck, Burrus said. The driver of the gasoline truck hit the back end 
of Maggs' truck and then struck the side of a Toyota pickup, she said. 
</P>
<P>
All the northbound lanes near Harbor Boulevard were closed for about 15 
minutes, and three lanes were closed for nearly an hour while crews worked to 
clear the wreckage, Burrus said. Maggs was not cited pending an investigation 
of the accident, Burrus said.

PANEL TO CONSIDER TWO RIDGELINE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission tonight will compare two proposed ordinances intended 
to protect undeveloped ridgelines and govern hillside development throughout 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a petition signed by more than 5,000 residents was delivered to the 
city in support of an initiative backed by the Laguna Niguel Ridgeline 
Protection and Preservation Committee, members said. A separate, city-backed 
ordinance has been in the making for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lawrence, whose San Juan Capistrano firm developed the proposal for the 
city, said that planning commissioners will compare the two options tonight. 
"They both try to achieve some of the same goals, so they're not really in 
contrast with each other," he said. "It's just that their focus is different." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Committee, however, have 
said repeatedly that they will push for their own ordinance, which they insist 
is tougher than the city plan. They say they have collected enough signatures 
to force a special election if city officials reject their proposal. The 
committee and the city have different setback requirements. 
</P>
<P>
One major difference in the two options is that the city's ordinance would give 
"city decision-making bodies more discretion in dealing with individual 
projects," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important distinction," he added. 
</P>
<P>
If city officials are not allowed such leeway, Lawrence said, some property 
could be rendered undevelopable, leaving the city open to potential legal 
problems. "That's our biggest concern," he said, "because you can't do that 
under the law." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Committee had attempted to 
have their proposed ordinance put on the Laguna Niguel City Council agenda last 
week to allow time to place the issue before voters in November's election. 
When they learned that the issue would not be placed on the agenda, committee 
members continued collecting signatures to make sure that they would have 
enough to call a special election if necessary. More signatures are needed to 
call a special election than are required to have a measure placed on the 
ballot during a regular election. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make sure this was ironclad so there was not a question in 
anybody's mind that we had enough to qualify," said Richard Taylor, chairman of 
the committee. However, since a special election would be an additional burden 
to taxpayers, Taylor said, committee members are hoping that city officials 
will endorse their ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real hard push," he said. "I feel it would be in their best 
interest if they adopted it. I mean 5,000 (signers) say they want it." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is expected to consider the two proposals tonight and 
then continue the public hearing until the Aug. 28 meeting, Lawrence said. 
Tonight's meeting will begin at 7 p.m. LESLIE EARNEST

RESIDENTS WAIL OVER EDISON SIREN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another case of the NIMBY -- Not in My Back Yard -- syndrome has surfaced, this 
time in the hillside community of Monarch Bay Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than jails or landfills, however, the object of homeowner concern is 
Southern California Edison Co.'s plan to install two emergency sirens. The 
sirens, part of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station warning system, were 
to be perched atop two 50-foot poles on Caribbean Drive until homeowners 
association representatives began complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Both the location and the sound level of the sirens have been issues in the 
community that overlooks Monarch Bay and Salt Creek Beach. The association has 
promised to take its case to the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"These sirens will be standing in front of some of our residents' views and 
right at the level of our bedrooms," said Richard Dombrow, an attorney and 
former president of the association. "It's ludicrous, really. These things do 
not have to be placed in the middle of our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The sirens would be the last of 50 devices that make up the nuclear station's 
emergency-warning network. The other 48 are scattered throughout the South 
County area in a 10-mile radius around the generating station just south of San 
Clemente, according to Edison spokesman David Barron. Six sirens are located in 
Dana Point, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarch Bay Terrace location is actually outside the federally mandated 
emergency zone, but Dana Point officials decided to make the zone contiguous 
with the city borders, said Ed Knight, the city's director of development. 
</P>
<P>
"These things are about as obtrusive as a street light," Knight said. "There's 
one near City Hall that was tested last September, and it sounds like any other 
siren. Maybe in the subdivision right below the pole, it could rattle the tiles 
a little." 
</P>
<P>
The sirens are designed to be a warning to anyone within earshot to turn on 
their radios or televisions for further emergency information, Barron said. 
Dombrow questioned the need for a warning siren at all for areas very close to 
the nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
"If the siren is telling us about an earthquake, we'll already know about 
that," he said. "If it's warning us about a nuclear problem, well, it will 
probably be too late for us by the time we hear it." LEN HALL

ADOPTED CAT CORNERS RATTLER NEAR CHILD'S BEDROOM 
</P>

<P>
When a 4-foot rattlesnake slithered into Holly Lenz's home Sunday afternoon, 
apparently headed for her 2-year-old son's bedroom, it was Lucy the adopted cat 
that sounded the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Lenz was outside in the sun, reading a book, when Lucy began hissing loudly. 
Lenz rushed inside and found the snake in a hallway, face to face with the cat, 
apparently trying to escape to the boy's bedroom. As Lucy kept the snake 
cornered, Lenz called police, who in turn alerted animal control authorities. 
</P>
<P>
When the ordeal was over the snake was dead, Lucy was being examined at an 
animal clinic and all the humans -- Adam the toddler, three police officers and 
an animal control worker -- were safe. 
</P>
<P>
"These three large, burly policemen stood well away and this little tiny woman 
from animal control went right in," Lenz said. "This little woman was fearless. 
She went right at it with one of those poles with a noose on it and got him by 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they pay these people enough." 
</P>
<P>
Lenz, 36, said the snake thrashed around when it was captured. Once it was 
taken outside, she said, a sheriff's deputy clubbed it with a shovel, chopping 
off its head. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you going to relocate a 4-foot rattlesnake?" Lenz said. "I mean it's 
sad but what were they going to do with him? So they buried the head in my back 
yard because it is poisonous for 24 hours, and they took the body away." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Wheeler of the Orange County Animal Control office said snakes are 
commonly seen this time of year in the coastal desert areas such as Laguna 
Niguel, as well 
</P>
<P>
as in other areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The reptiles usually don't move into people's homes, Wheeler said, but they are 
more active during spring and summer when temperatures are warmer, often 
entering lawns and sunning themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Rattlesnakes usually strike only when they have been approached and challenged, 
Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, the people who get bit are those who are surprised by the snake." 
</P>
<P>
As for Lenz, she said she won't keep the sliding glass door to her bedroom open 
any more and will be more aware of the wildlife that abounds in South County. 
She said Lucy the cat, while fearless with the snake, needs a few lessons on 
dealing with people. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute the police showed up, my cat went under the bed," Lenz said. "She's 
not afraid of the rattlesnake but she's afraid of other people."

<P>
Four residents who participated in the Gay Games in Canada last week have 
returned home with 11 medals, according to one of the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ammon, a clinical psychologist who competed for the second time in the 
international amateur athletic contest, said members of Team Laguna won medals 
for swimming and tennis in competitions divided by age categories. 
</P>
<P>
More than 7,500 athletes from at least a dozen nations took part in the Gay 
Games III and Cultural Festival, which were observed by thousands of 
spectators, he said. Ammon, who won two silver and two bronze medals in the age 
45 to 49 category, said he was nervous and excited during the competition, but 
the overall environment was supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not killer competition," he said. "It's genuinely friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Another Team Laguna member, Robert Mastroberti, won a bronze medal for swimming 
in the 25 to 29 age category. Two other Laguna residents won a total of six 
medals in swimming and tennis competitions.

ANGELS' MCCASKILL DEFEATS YANKEES, 4-2, CUTS ERA TO 2.96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the public fixes its gaze on the pitcher who might win 20 games and the 
pitcher who might lose 20, Kirk McCaskill presses on. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley has won 15 games, and Mark Langston has lost 15. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill is merely 8-8 after the Angels' 4-2 victory Monday over New York in 
front of 28,387 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But his ordinary record obscures an extraordinary earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's 2.96 ERA is the fourth best in the American League, surpassed only 
by those of Roger Clemens, Finley, and Dave Stewart, all likely 20-game 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, who gave up one run on six hits in seven innings Friday, has 
fashioned this ERA despite pitching with bone spurs in his right elbow. He 
expects to have surgery the day after the season ends, or even the day after 
his final start, if the team approves. His victory Monday was his first career 
win over the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
His name disappears and reappears in the ERA standings because the number of 
innings he has pitched barely qualify him. But with his start each week, he 
usually pulls back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's tendency to find himself in 2-1 games and a sometime loser because 
of lack of support has been much documented. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill has seen his share too. In Monday's game, he led, 2-1, from the third 
inning until the Angels scored two runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Three times that he has pitched, the Angels have played 2-1 games, winning one. 
</P>
<P>
In his eight losses, the Angels have scored five runs at the time of his 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill defended himself Monday, getting out of a spot in the seventh when 
the Yankees put runners on first and third with none out. 
</P>
<P>
He got Bob Geren to chase a low, outside pitch, hitting it to third base where 
Jesse Barfield was caught in a rundown. He got the second out by getting Matt 
Nokes to pop to short, and the third by striking out Roberto Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who were guaranteed not to fall into last place in the American 
League West only by virtue of Minnesota's day off, had a 2-0 lead after two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee starter Chuck Cary, who would last only two innings before being removed 
with back spasms, walked the first batter he faced, Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
Downing went to third on Donnie Hill's single, and scored on Lance Parrish's 
two-out single. Lee Stevens grounded to second, stranding two runners. 
</P>
<P>
Cary, the only Yankee pitcher to win consecutive starts this season, had not 
won a game since June 19, spanning nine starts. He didn't give himself an 
opportunity to win this one. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels put runners on first and third in the second inning on Dick 
Schofield's walk and Downing's single. 
</P>
<P>
Cary let Schofield come home when he threw a wild pitch, way high, enabling 
Schofield to slide in safe ahead of catcher Bob Geren's throw from the backstop 
to Cary, who had moved in to cover the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Downing took second on the play, but Hill flied out to end the inning. Cary was 
through, removed as a precautionary measure because of the muscle spasms in his 
back, according to a report from the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got a run back in the third inning, trimming the lead to 2-1 on two 
singles and a groundout. Oscar Azocar's two-out single to center drove in 
Alvaro Espinoza, who had singled and taken second on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels wasted a fine opportunity to break the unsteady grip of their 2-1 
lead, loading the bases with one out in the fifth inning on singles by Dave 
Winfield and Lance Parrish and Lee Stevens' walk. 
</P>
<P>
They walked away empty-handed after Devon White struck out and Kent Anderson 
grounded to short. 
</P>
<P>
White, sent to triple-A Edmonton last month to work on his hitting and 
discipline at the plate, seemed much improved when he returned, going eight for 
his 27 in his first six games back. But in the past seven games before Monday, 
he had gone five for 30, including 11 consecutive hitless at-bats entering 
Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels led, 4-1, after eight innings, before Jesse Barfield's solo homer, 
his 16th, to left off Bryan Harvey cut it to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
The homer was only the second this season allowed by Harvey, who had not 
allowed one in 40 innings covering 30 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey pitched the eighth and ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston says one of the most difficult things about his 15 losses this 
season is the wait for the next start and the possibility it brings for putting 
the last behind him. There will be no long wait this time. Langston, who gave 
up eight runs in 2 2/3 innings Sunday, will start Wednesday on two days' rest. 
He will replace Bert Blyleven, who will skip a start after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his strained right shoulder Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the ball any time they want to give it to me," Langston said. "I 
didn't do that much work (Sunday). I don't think that will have any effect." 
Langston (5-15) threw only 64 pitches Sunday, his 10th loss in his past 11 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, whose next start will be Saturday, said the chance for him to skip a 
start will be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Langston said he believes he has corrected several mechanical flaws in his 
complicated delivery, and that he "felt sound (Sunday) for the first time in a 
long time" despite his poor performance. Langston said he was consoled by 
pitchers Blyleven, Kirk McCaskill and Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
"They really picked me up," he said, also including Manager Doug Rader. "I was 
down. . . . The more you talk about it, the easier it is to get rid of it."

COASTAL INSURANCE OFFICERS SUED FOR FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: COMMISSIONER GILLESPIE, IN A CIVIL COMPLAINT, SEEKS TO RECOVER $66 
MILLION ALLEGEDLY DRAINED FROM COASTAL AND RELATED COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie has filed a civil suit 
charging operators of the bankrupt Coastal Insurance Co. with racketeering, 
fraud, gross mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty, and is asking that 
they be ordered to reimburse state liquidators $66 million plus punitive 
damages, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court accuses Harry O. 
Miller, president of Coastal; Gerald Milton, an officer and director of a 
Coastal holding company; Sidney M. Field, owner of FGS Acquisition Co., and 
numerous other Coastal officers and directors of illicitly draining the auto 
insurance company of funds and forcing it into insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
"California will not tolerate this kind of fraudulent and self-serving 
behavior," Gillespie said in a statement Monday. "This department fully intends 
to prosecute those who violate the public trust." 
</P>
<P>
A secretary in Miller's office said he was on vacation and unavailable for 
comment. Attorneys for other defendants could not be reached, but Miller, 
Milton, Field and other Coastal officers last year denied to a legislative 
investigatory panel that they were guilty of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal suit isn't Field's first run-in with the Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In April, his FGS Insurance Co. of Irvine was accused by the department of 
fraudulent sales practices and other violations of state insurance regulations. 
A Sept. 11 hearing in Costa Mesa has been scheduled to determine whether the 
company should be allowed to retain its state license, according to Dennis 
Ward, a Department of Insurance investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Field, whose own insurance license was revoked by the state several years ago, 
currently is owner of FGS Insurance but has said through his attorney that he 
is selling the company to a management group. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said recently, however, that his department had not been notified of any 
ownership change and is not sure of Field's status with the company. The state 
has ordered FGS to sever all ties with Field as one condition to retaining its 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the investigative division had logged more than 250 customer 
complaints against FGS when the administrative charges were issued April 18. 
Since then, he said, "the complaints have kept coming into the department at a 
significant rate." The complaints, he said, basically involve customers' 
difficulties in getting FGS to pay their claims. 
</P>
<P>
In the Coastal case, Richard D. Martland, chief assistant state attorney 
general in charge of the civil division, said there still could be criminal 
indictments, depending on the course of the investigation. The attorney 
general's office and two outside attorneys will represent Gillespie in the 
civil case. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rosen, chief liquidator for the Department of Insurance, said Gillespie 
decided to proceed first with the civil suit in part because the penalties for 
civil wrongdoing are much greater in terms of dollars than the relatively small 
fines called for in the criminal code. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen said Coastal "would have been close" to remaining solvent had wrongful 
diversions of funds not occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to get at least some of the $66 million we have in claims against 
Coastal back," Rosen said, even though Advent, the Coastal holding company -- 
to which many of the alleged diversions were initially made -- has also gone 
bankrupt. "Whatever we recover goes into the estate of Coastal and goes to pay 
these claims." 
</P>
<P>
Coastal became well known to television viewers in the late 1980s for its 
advertising slogan, "It's no problem," and sold about 200,000 policies, mainly 
in Southern California, by appealing to drivers with poor records. 
</P>
<P>
It went bankrupt early last year and was ordered liquidated on the petition of 
Gillespie shortly after Miller had made $5.2 million in political contributions 
to a campaign for a 1988 insurance initiative, Proposition 101, that ended up 
winning only 13.3% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Gillespie lawsuit alleges that the political contributions were among the 
funds drained from the company at a time when it should have been apparent to 
its operators that it was in dire difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also names a $17.5-million purchase of FGS as another example of how 
funds were drained from Coastal. Just before the company went bankrupt, the 
suit notes, Coastal sold FGS back to Field for only $156,000, and even that 
amount was allegedly not paid to Coastal. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has been engaged for more than a year in an effort to force Field to 
divest his interest in FGS. Although the Insurance Department took away Field's 
license, a loophole in state law allows him to continue in business as long as 
someone in his employ has a license. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint against Coastal officials charges the defendants with creating 
various schemes to divert funds from Coastal, including gross overpayment of 
commissions, payment of illegal bonuses and dividends, and pursuing deals 
between officers that were of benefit only to them. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, claims against Coastal that cannot be paid by company 
assets are assessed against all California insurance policyholders.

FUNDAMERICA'S TOP SELLERS SEEK INVESTORS TO JOIN NEW COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
SALES: THE VENTURE WOULD BE RUN LIKE THE BELEAGUERED FIRM AND INCLUDE MANY OF 
ITS FORMER MEMBERS.

<P>
With FundAmerica Inc.'s assets frozen, some of its top salespeople have decided 
to strike out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty or more of FundAmerica's "presidential directors" -- seeking to 
continuing living in the high style to which they've been accustomed -- have 
formed a company called VisionMarketing that intends to join forces with 
another multilevel marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"VisionMarketing was started by the top producers of FundAmerica," said a 
VisionMarketing spokesman, who asked not to be identified. "Most of the top 
guys were making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a month with Fund-America. We're all 
stuck without jobs and we have a lot of bills out there that need to get paid 
because we were doing a lot of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica and its founder, Robert T. Edwards, are facing criminal charges of 
fraud and operating an illegal pyramid scheme in Florida. They are also facing 
a federal civil class-action lawsuit charging fraud. Both the company and 
Edwards have denied the criminal and civil charges. 
</P>
<P>
The federal judge in the $150-million civil suit has frozen Fund-America's 
assets, preventing it from paying any sales commissions to its 100,000 members, 
including its presidential directors, who are at the top rung of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential directors are Fund-America's top salepeople, who achieve that 
position by bringing 10 directors into the company. A director must purchase 40 
memberships at wholesale, an investment of about $3,200. The presidential 
directors receive commissions on sales by each director. 
</P>
<P>
The company claims it is a multilevel marketing firm and consumer-buying club 
that offers its members cash rebates on services such as travel. But 
authorities in several states, including California, say it is a pyramid 
scheme, deriving almost all of its income from membership sales. 
</P>
<P>
VisionMarketing is structured in a similar fashion to FundAmerica and has 
started taking out newspaper advertisements to attract members. In fact, it is 
appealing directly to FundAmerica members to join. 
</P>
<P>
"FundAmericans. Why have over 20 presidential directors (top salespeople) with 
earnings in excess of $30,000 per month got involved in our program?," asked 
one ad placed recently in the Los Angeles Times. "Here's YOUR opportunity of 
the decade to be front-line with successful leaders. Success breeds success." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of FundAmerica -- which once billed itself as "the financial 
opportunity of the decade" -- refused to comment on VisionMarketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us thought FundAmerica was the greatest thing in the world," said the 
VisionMarketing spokesman. "We have gotten our hearts ripped out as well as our 
pocketbooks." 
</P>
<P>
VisionMarketing said Monday that it has reached a tentative agreement to 
distribute the products of Sparks, Nev.-based Phoenix International Corp., 
which it claims is a multilevel marketing company. The firm makes diet cookies 
and supplements for everyone from "Girl Scouts to retirement homes" according 
to VisionMarketing. 
</P>
<P>
Just like FundAmerica, Phoenix International has different levels of sales 
employees who soon find that it pays to bring in new members. While they were 
called directors in FundAmerica, Phoenix calls them counselors and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix International itself has gotten into trouble lately. The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration notified the company in May that its marketing practices 
were violating federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The company "made unsubstantiated medical claims that the products were useful 
for weight control, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, diabetes and 
diverticulitis," the FDA said in a May statement. 
</P>
<P>
Some diabetics were told that they could eat the cookies instead of taking 
insulin, the agency said. "Use of these products in lieu of medication 
prescribed by a physician could present serious adverse health consequences for 
some individuals," the FDA warned in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
Besides those claims, tests by the FDA and the state of Mississippi showed that 
the cookies weren't neither low-calorie nor high fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"It had about half the fiber as they claimed and about twice the calories," 
said Janet McDonald, consumer affairs officer with the FDA in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix International withdrew its products but has since put them back on the 
market after getting a labeling change approved by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix International executives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, Texas Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox filed a lawsuit charging 
Phoenix International with making deceptive claims about its product. The 
Consumer Protection Report -- a periodical for state attorneys general -- 
reported that the lawsuit required the company to refund money to anyone 
returning the cookies and to pay $18,000 to the state for its costs. 
</P>
<P>
The company is under investigation in several states. "We've been taking a look 
at it," said Philip Byrnes, deputy attorney general of consumer affairs in 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix International has more than 50,000 independent distributors, many in 
the southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
Besides VisionMarketing, two FundAmerica salespeople are taking out newspaper 
ads trying to convince compatriots to start selling the nutritional products of 
another multilevel marketer, Dallas-based Omnitrition. 
</P>
<P>
The company sells drinks and other products with names like "Wow" and "Go for 
It." Omni IV is an earth-colored drink containing kelp, ginseng and bee pollen. 
Jerry Rubin, who gained fame as one of the Chicago Seven in the late 1960s, is 
one of Omnitrition's top salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Top salespeople earn in excess of $30,000 a month, said FundAmerica member Dave 
Sarro. "Don't be left out," he urged in a newspaper ad. "Go where most of the 
top moneymakers are. Our program is the hottest program today. Without a doubt 
the financial opportunity of the decade."

Symbiotic Relationship: Sterling Microsystems Inc., an Anaheim computer 
company, said Monday that it has entered into a joint reseller agreement with 
Tricord Systems Inc. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is valued at more than $2 million, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Tricord develops and markets network server equipment that Sterling will sell

customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our agreement with Sterling Microsystems is another step in our strategic plan 
to develop a strong, competent distribution channel," said Tricord President

perfect match."

CLOSURE OF ADULT THEATER IN SANTA ANA REFLECTS TREND CREDITED TO -- OR BLAMED 
ON -- THE VIDEOCASSETTE REVOLUTION

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last picture show of its kind folded quietly a few weeks back, but don't 
expect any public mourning. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, men who didn't get the word still walk up to the ticket window, only 
to be disappointed. And as they slink back to their cars, they don't want to 
give their names, don't want their pictures taken, don't want to rhapsodize 
over memorable films they watched in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
That's because this was a porn theater, a raincoats-optional refuge for men on 
their lunch hour, or retired, or curious, or sexually depraved or deprived -- a 
porn theater that brought them in by the hundreds every day for more than a 
dozen years, despite the fury of the neighbors and the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
What the city of Santa Ana couldn't do in an 11-year, $700,000 battle, and what 
Charles H. Keating couldn't do before he became better known as the head of the 
financially troubled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., time did: It ate up the 
lease and closed the Mitchell Brothers theater. 
</P>
<P>
On June 30, several hundred men -- no one seems certain of exact numbers, but 
everyone seems sure that only men were present -- viewed "The First Time," "Hot 
Lips" and "The Devil in Miss Jones IV." Then, with no fanfare, the theater 
closed, a relic of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
The closing followed the shuttering in recent years of adult theaters in Long 
Beach, Huntington Park, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Once upon a time, Santa Ana 
had two adult theaters; now it has none. Orange County has two X-rated theaters 
left, both in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is down to about 13 adult theaters. "I think we've probably lost 
four or five . . . in the last year," said Robert Peters, a vice detective for 
the Los Angeles Police Department. Five years ago, the number was probably in 
the 20s, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Fisher, who works for the firm that owns the Pussycat theaters, a major 
purveyor of X-rated movies, said the chain had 20 or so movie houses in 
Southern California in the early 1980s and is down to nine now. When one of the 
two owners died, she said, the other "just tired of them, I guess" and sold 
most of them off. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the rationale for shedding the movie houses was economic, Fisher 
said: "We were losing business in a lot of the theaters that were closed up. 
And videotapes were the reason." 
</P>
<P>
Videotapes and videocassette recorders are "the perfect delivery system" for 
X-rated films, said John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills lawyer who has argued 
sexual censorship cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Adult theaters "required people to watch very intimate communications in a 
quasi-public setting," Weston said. Now movies that are "more appropriate in 
one's bedroom or another room of one's home" are available for viewing in those 
rooms. "Also," he said, "(at-home) video is much cheaper, and you don't have to 
drive, and you don't have to pay parking, and you can get better, fresher 
popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, said Weston, adult theaters are "as much an endangered species as 
the California condor -- with less chance of survival." 
</P>
<P>
Weston's experience reflects the change. An organization he represents once was 
known as the Adult Film Assn. of America; now it's called the Adult Video Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Adult Film Assn. of America estimated the number of adult theaters across 
the United States at 800 in 1979. Weston guessed that today no more than 50 are 
left, with even big cities like New York and Chicago down to only a few. 
</P>
<P>
Weston said videotape was the main reason for the closing of porn palaces, but 
there were others as well. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that lost court battles to close the theaters were able to use zoning 
restrictions, ruled constitutional by the courts, that prevented new X-rated 
theaters from opening. Oil shocks raised the price of heating a porn theater in 
the Midwest or East in the winter and of air conditioning it in the summer. 
Redevelopment razed blighted neighborhoods, the traditional home for adult 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
But video remains the chief cause. 
</P>
<P>
The annual buyers guide of Adult Video News, a publication on the industry, 
says that in 1983, 8% of the releases were shot on video, with the rest shot on 
film. Last year, 97% of the releases were shot on video. 
</P>
<P>
But "for every pound of porno that was in the market 10 years ago, there's 10 
pounds now," said Jim Mitchell. He and his brother, Artie, make up the Mitchell 
Brothers, who ran the Santa Ana theater until it closed and who still operate 
adult theaters in Northern California, some of which feature live entertainment 
as well as X-rated movies. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitchell Brothers took over the Santa Ana theater in 1975. What had been a 
neighborhood place showing movies like "Swiss Family Robinson" and "The Apple 
Dumpling Gang" suddenly began showing "Sodom and Gomorrah," a Mitchell 
Brothers-produced extravaganza that one writer labeled, because of its cost, 
"the 'Gone With the Wind' of American pornography." 
</P>
<P>
The pastor of a church across the street helped spearhead opposition to the new 
films, and the city of Santa Ana filed its first lawsuit against the theater 
the next year. For more than a decade, the city shelled out hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in attorney fees in losing battles to shut the theater 
down. 
</P>
<P>
For 11 years, a former Los Angeles Police Department vice officer attended 
every movie shown by the theater, getting paid $30 an hour to film the films, 
audiotape the dialogue and take notes so that a judge could review the movies 
and decide if they were obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Several movies were indeed judged obscene, but no judge ruled the theater a 
"public nuisance," which would have let the city close it. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, the Mitchell Brothers attorney wasn't even required to show up 
in court; he phoned in his objections to the city's lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, after filing 47 lawsuits, the city threw in the towel, letting the 
theater continue to show X-rated movies and paying the Mitchell Brothers 
$120,000 in exchange for removal of the theater marquee that advertised the 
films. The city also paid $80,000 in fees for the Mitchell Brothers attorneys. 
After the suits were settled, the owners of the theater building said they 
would not renew the lease with the Mitchell Brothers when it expired. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's action, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., then headed by 
millionaire anti-pornography crusader Charles H. Keating, filed a lawsuit of 
its own. The bank, which has a branch diagonally across the street from the 
Honer Plaza shopping center that contains the theater, lost its suit as well. 
(The federal government later took over the bank after it failed. Keating has 
been charged with fraudulently diverting depositors' money, although those 
allegations are not connected to the bank's suit against the theater.) 
</P>
<P>
The most vociferous critic of the theater on the City Council was John Acosta. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that Acosta is a prude. After all, he once judged a beauty 
contest and wound up pictured in Oui magazine as part of an article titled 
"Oui's Orange County Girlie Search . . . the biggest flesh hunt in Southern 
California history." 
</P>
<P>
But Acosta didn't want an X-rated theater in his district, which is exactly 
where the Mitchell Brothers movie house was. So over the years he consistently 
held out against settling the lawsuits, until he was outvoted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But after the lawsuits were settled, even Acosta lost track of the theater's 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"When are they closing it?" Acosta asked two weeks ago, nearly a month after 
the theater was already shut. "Didn't they have another year or two to go (on 
the lease)?" 
</P>
<P>
"I would just have to say good riddance to an ugly cancer in our community," 
Acosta added. "Frankly, I don't think Santa Ana has any use for those kind of 
theaters." 
</P>
<P>
One man who did have a use for the theater walked up to the ticket window at 
noon one day last week and was clearly taken aback to see the banner reading 
"Permanently Closed." 
</P>
<P>
"Did they move it?" he asked someone standing nearby. "It just says 'Closed,' 
nothing else." He shook his head, got in his car and drove away.

JOSEPH N. BELL: A FORMER INSIDER'S VIEW OF CHANGING UCI CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago this week, I packed my belongings and moved out of the office 
in the UC Irvine English department that had been my retreat for 21 years. One 
of the first columns I wrote for this space described my feelings that day. My 
UCI colleagues decided to frame that column and hang it on the wall of my 
one-time office "in perpetuity" -- a gesture that warmed me deeply. And still 
does. 
</P>
<P>
I went out to check the other day, and it's still there. The present occupant 
of the office is a friend who is familiar with the history of that framed 
talisman. But I couldn't help wondering how an occupant of this space 20 or 30 
years down the line might regard this unabashedly sentimental relic of a period 
with which he or she will feel little connection. I find some solace in knowing 
that I probably won't be around to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the framed column on the wall, my old office has properly taken on 
the shape and character of the present occupant. The rug on the floor (the 
placing of which never occurred to me), the growing things (which I could never 
sustain), the pictures and mementoes and awards all belong to someone else and 
exert no nostalgic pull on me. Nor any regrets. 
</P>
<P>
But these reactions impelled me to wander the campus for the first time in 
three years to see what nostalgia -- if any -- remained. It was rather like 
meeting up with an old and intimate friend after a long separation. What 
changes have taken place? Have they obscured the old attractions? Can bridges 
be built to these new places? 
</P>
<P>
When I left UCI, so much of my life had been spent there for so long that I 
envisioned frequent returns to my old haunts. I bought a year's parking sticker 
and was even allowed to keep the key to my old office so that I might use it 
when the new occupant was absent. 
</P>
<P>
But happily, none of that took place. Happily, because the break needed to be 
clean rather than tenuous. Facing up to the hopes and challenges of a new life 
could only be delayed and adulterated by hanging on to the vestiges of the old. 
So I didn't visit the campus very often, and when I did, it was for a specific 
purpose -- to speak in a classroom or do research in the library or meet a 
friend for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the campus grew up and away from me. I looked, but I didn't see. 
Maybe on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
When I left UCI, the omnipresent construction on campus that reduced walking to 
an obstacle course made it much easier for me not to look back. So many of the 
places that gave me pleasure were unreachable behind high board fences, put up 
to protect us from the wrecking balls and construction equipment. The message 
was clear. This small, rather reclusive campus was about to go big-time -- and 
I really didn't care to stay and watch. 
</P>
<P>
So on this day, I set out to see what came after the wrecking ball. And if any 
of the places I remembered warmly were still intact. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the room in which I taught all those years has changed very 
little. It was called the Writing Center in the beginning and is now the Howard 
Babb Writing Center, a memorial to perhaps the most delightfully fierce, 
intense, dedicated human being I've ever known, who died much too early of a 
heart attack and left an indelible mark on the department he headed. 
</P>
<P>
But once I was outside the comfortable familiarity of the Humanities Building, 
the terrain became strange and wondrous. The funky student center that once 
blended inconspicuously with its surroundings is now an enormous, sprawling, 
glass-and-chrome structure full of lounges and eating places and towers and 
lattice-work. It was wonderfully uncrowded on this day, when planters were 
being filled with green things as the final touch in its construction. 
</P>
<P>
Across the way are a new Student Services Building and a Cross Cultural Center, 
both upgraded from trailers in my day. From the graceful foot bridge that 
crosses to a burgeoning Town Center, I could get a panoramic view of the almost 
completed Irvine Theater, built on sloping grassland that once housed the 
student festivals. And behind the theater, atop a parking lot that used to fill 
up by 7:30 each morning, is a new four-level parking garage, which also 
probably fills up at 7:30 every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Passing the main library took me out of Humanities country and made me realize 
how parochial my UCI life had been. I only visited the other side of the campus 
under duress. I once taught a class in American film in a room in the 
Engineering Building so difficult to find that I had to meet my guest speakers 
-- Jack Nicholson, Charlton Heston, James Earl Jones, Frank Capra, among others 
-- at an off-campus filling station and escort them to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
But here, clearly, is where the major growth is taking place, hardly surprising 
considering the sources of the money. The new Graduate School of Management 
looks rather like an oversized and well-windowed barn. Beyond it, in quick 
succession, are the new bread-and-butter buildings of this high-tech campus. 
</P>
<P>
There's the Rockwell Engineering Center and the McDonnell Douglas Engineering 
Auditorium and the ICS Engineering Research facility (I wondered idly what 
company might donate a comparable facility to the English department). Then the 
massive new Physical Science Building with its research and classroom support 
complex. And still under construction, a greatly expanded home for the 
biological sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The new buildings are a wild mix of architectural styles (and would never 
attract a sequel of "Planet of the Apes" which was made at UCI because of the 
rather surrealistic consistency of the architecture). I was getting a headache 
on this side of the campus, so I cut through Aldrich Park and headed for 
familiar territory. I felt better instantly. I could almost see Chancellor Dan 
picking up stray wisps of paper. And then, in the center of the park, still 
untouched, was the tree-shaded alcove where my youngest daughter was married. 
</P>
<P>
In simpler times -- 15 years ago -- we were allowed to use the campus over the 
July 4th weekend for her wedding and a reception in the adjacent plaza. 
</P>
<P>
I replayed that scene all the way across the park, then wandered through the 
Humanities Building on the way to my car, looking at familiar nameplates of 
friends, still in place on office doors. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere en route, it hit me that I had just passed through a watershed. I was 
no longer involved in production at UCI; rather, I was a consumer of what the 
campus has to offer. I found that a comfortable place. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if the new money pouring into UCI will only procure a few large and 
well-muscled basketball players. . . .

FINE ARTS SCHOOL IN LAGUNA REJECTS GRANT FROM NEA; 
</P>
<P>
OBSCENITY: THE PRESIDENT OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TELLS THE 
FEDERAL AGENCY THAT ACCEPTANCE OF $15,000 WOULD ENDORSE A FORM OF CENSORSHIP.

<P>
The Art Institute of Southern California, in rejecting a $15,000 grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts, has become the first Orange County 
organization to turn down money from the embattled agency. 
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of their president, Russell E. Lewis, trustees of the 
small fine arts school voted unanimously late last week to turn down the grant 
rather than sign an NEA-mandated anti-obscenity certification required of all 
1990 grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"By accepting the grant, the institution would be taking the first step down 
the very dangerous path of censorship," Lewis wrote in a letter to the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
The obscenity clause is the result of protests from right-wing groups against 
federal support of art exhibits containing controversial work. In its 1990 
funding bill for the NEA, Congress last fall outlawed support for obscene work 
that does not meet unspecified artistic standards. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Lewis voiced support of the NEA as "a major force in the 
fostering of creativity in America," but protested the congressional ruling: 
"Speech and expression should not be restricted or legislated by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen artists and arts groups across the country have rejected NEA 
grants to protest the obscenity oath. They include Los Angeles' Bella Lewitzky 
Dance Co. and the New School for Social Research, a university in New York 
City, both of which have sued the NEA over the new restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County arts groups have written the NEA to protest the 
anti-obscenity certification, but until now none had turned down grants. 
Indeed, the Pacific Symphony, Pacific Chorale, Laguna Art Museum, Orange County 
Philharmonic Society and Opera Pacific all have accepted grants. The Newport 
Harbor Art Museum has not decided whether to accept three pending grants 
totaling $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 students attend the Art Institute, the only art institute in Orange 
County that awards a bachelor of fine arts degree. Plans call for enrollment to 
triple over the next several years. In his letter, Lewis wrote of the impact of 
the grant rejection decision on students. 
</P>
<P>
"As a practicing attorney and president of an institution dedicated to 
fostering creativity in the intellects of college students, I would find it 
impossible to in any way sanction actions which erode the rights guaranteed by 
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA grant would have been the school's first and would have subsidized 
planning of an on-campus, outdoor public sculpture park, a spokeswoman said.

'FORUM' OFFERS VISION OF A 'NEW VAUDEVILLE' OF '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Des McAnuff gets a laugh out of his own assertion that the revival of "A Funny 
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," which begins Friday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center for 13 performances, represents the "new 
vaudeville" of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
A case could be made for the idea, he said, relaxing one morning last week in 
faded jeans and an orange T-shirt at the La Jolla Playhouse office behind the 
Mandell Weiss Theatre, where the acclaimed revival has just ended a six-week 
run. 
</P>
<P>
But McAnuff -- who staged the production and who is the artistic director of 
the Playhouse -- would rather not take the idea too far, considering how 
pretentious it might sound. 
</P>
<P>
After all, how could he describe the new vaudeville? As post-modern shtick? The 
mere phrase seems ridiculous -- not unlike the term "comedic kinetics," which 
the show's slapstick and clown coach, Jeff Gordon, has applied in jest to the 
circus-style antics that he developed for this "Forum." 
</P>
<P>
"We borrowed shtick freely," said McAnuff, "from Gleason, from Berle, from 
Belushi. There are a lot of influences. The new vaudevillians plug into all the 
old burlesque. Some of the shtick goes back to the Borscht Belt and some of it 
goes all the way back to Plautus, including jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Still, this production has an unabashed physical exuberance emblematic of the 
new vaudeville that never appeared in any of "Forum's" previous revivals on or 
off Broadway. Pratfalls, for instance, are turned into pitfalls. In fact, the 
acrobatic use of the orchestra pit has become a signature of sorts, 
demonstrating the length to which McAnuff and his cohorts will go for a gag. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does their showmanship end there. In his ambition to resurrect and 
re-examine what he calls "an American musical classic," McAnuff has revamped 
everything from the orchestrations to the choreography, while also revising 
entire song-and-dance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
That takes chutzpah -- even for someone with McAnuff's record, which includes 
developing "Big River" at La Jolla and winning a Tony Award for directing it on 
Broadway in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The original "Forum" did just fine in George Abbott's 1962 staging. It ran for 
967 performances and won six Tony Awards, including best musical. Why fix what 
wasn't broken? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, "Forum" isn't simply any old hit farce written by Burt Shevelove and 
Larry Gelbart. It happens to be the first show for which Steven Sondheim, the 
reigning genius of today's musical stage, wrote both the score and lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"I planned to have it reorchestrated right from the beginning," McAnuff said, 
"because if you don't you are more or less forced to ape the original. I wanted 
to start fresh. I didn't want to be stuck with choices that were already made 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was call Steven and tell him I was going to do this. I 
asked if he had any objections to my having new orchestrations done. And he 
said no. Actually, he seemed to be delighted." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Coughlin's new orchestrations -- not to be confused with new arrangements 
-- entailed the creation of "three to four times more incidental music" than 
originally used, McAnuff explained. It not only meant feeding in thematic 
elements from the songs to cover changes in the action, it also meant melding 
differences between the music for the original production and the major 
Broadway revival of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, the new orchestration restored a full song-and-dance variation 
of "The House of Marcus Lycus," which had been used by Abbott simply as a dance 
break. In another instance, "The Echo Song" -- intended for Abbott's original 
production but never staged -- was put back in and its replacement ("That'll 
Show 'Em") taken out. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such meticulous efforts, and capital costs of nearly $600,000 by 
McAnuff's rough estimate, neither the La Jolla Playhouse nor the Center -- 
which is co-financing the revival as an equal partner -- expects this "Forum" 
to tour beyond their two venues. 
</P>
<P>
"We said from the beginning we were going to take it to (the Center in) Costa 
Mesa and that was all," McAnuff noted. "There has been interest in the show, 
but I really have no idea whether anything will happen. The producers who are 
most likely to do something with it haven't come to see it yet. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything does happen, it would have to be a remount. And I doubt that any 
tour would go out immediately after Orange County. Frankly, my biggest ambition 
with this piece would be to put it on tape or film at the Center. But I don't 
think that will be done." 
</P>
<P>
The urge to document the revival goes back to the 1966 "Forum" movie starring 
Zero Mostel, who also starred in the Broadway original. That dull Hollywood 
version essentially ruined the show for a whole generation of theatergoers, 
McAnuff contended. So he hopes this "Forum" will serve at least as a local 
corrective. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, McAnuff has no doubt that the combination of Sondheim's most accessible 
score and the Plautus-based story -- involving several farcical Roman 
characters but chiefly a slave trying to obtain his freedom -- places "Forum" 
among "the 10 best book musicals of the American theater." His other picks 
include "My Fair Lady" and "Guys and Dolls," ("the two greatest"), "Sweeny 
Todd" and "West Side Story" ("even with its flawed book"), "A Chorus Line" 
("the only dance musical to survive as dramatic literature") and "Oklahoma" 
("not a personal favorite"). 
</P>
<P>
As for the so-called spectacle shows of the '80s -- such as "Cats," "The 
Phantom of the Opera" and all the British musicals -- McAnuff is less 
impressed. "I think the jury is still out on them," he said. "I don't think 
'Les Miz' has a terribly strong score, for instance, though I do think Trevor 
Nunn's staging is brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he maintains that the basic problem with the current musical theater 
is not a lack of material but "not enough places to develop it." And not enough 
people with the know-how. 
</P>
<P>
"There are maybe a few people around," he said. "It's just not like the old 
days in New York when you had all these guys working within eight blocks of 
each other near 42nd Street. Everybody was there -- orchestrators, copyists, a 
whole industry." 
</P>
<P>
Like everyone else, McAnuff points to the exorbitant costs of mounting musicals 
as a major reason for the decline. But he also notes that a change in popular 
musical taste -- specifically the arrival of rock 'n' roll during the '50s -- 
was crucial as well. "Until that time Broadway and pop music were the same 
thing," he said. "Then the split took place, and it has never been bridged." 
</P>
<P>
Some small steps toward closing the gap have been taken with the Eurorock 
musical, he believes, but "theater people are snobbish about welcoming rockers 
in, as if there's some mystique about writing theater music." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, top-draw rock musicians are not beating on the doors for entry, 
although McAnuff does get occasional calls from their agents. Between records 
and concerts, rockers have more lucrative outlets for their work than the 
theater.

WHEN IS A NISSAN NOT REALLY A NISSAN?;

It says "Nissan" on the grille. It looks like a Nissan, feels like a Nissan and 
drives like a Nissan. But could it be -- a British car? 
</P>
<P>
The riddle has been dogging European trade officials since Japan's No. 2 auto 
maker, Nissan Motor Corp., started producing its standard Bluebird model in a 
new factory here four years ago. The issue is heating up as Western Europe 
nears its goal of economic unification by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody disputes the fact that the 77,000 passenger vehicles that rolled off the 
Sunderland assembly line last year were made by British workers, or that about 
two-thirds of the components came from sources in Europe. But a bitter quarrel 
has raged over whether to classify the product as friend or foe. 
</P>
<P>
The French and Italians are leading the fight. They say that Japanese car 
makers aim to exploit their new British production facilities, that it is a 
Trojan horse scheme for attacking the European auto industry from within. 
</P>
<P>
They advocate keeping protective quotas on Japanese car imports, which, in 
principle, are to be abolished after members of the European Community 
integrate their economies in 1992. They also want to label the British-made 
Nissans products of Japan. The same would go for locally made Honda and Toyota 
models that soon will start streaming into the European market. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans and the British, however, have been waving the flag of free 
trade -- more or less. They counter that Japanese competition is good, because 
it will strengthen European industry, and that investment in local production 
should be encouraged because it would bring technology and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But now, even Japan's free-trade patrons have softened their stance. 
</P>
<P>
On June 19, the 12 trade ministers of the European Community countries met in 
Luxembourg and reached what one spokesman described as an "apparent consensus" 
that transplant production within Europe should be treated the same as imports 
from Japan. For a "transitional period" after 1992, the more cars Japan 
produces in Europe, the fewer it should be allowed to import to Europe from 
Japan, the ministers announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto industry, understandably, balked at that announcement. After 
some apparent backtracking, the EC's official position is far from clear, but 
indications are that, to the Europeans, a Japanese car is a Japanese car, no 
matter where -- or how -- it is made. 
</P>
<P>
No such restrictions are being contemplated for Ford or General Motors, both of 
which make about 1.5 million vehicles annually in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand how they can distinguish between a brand name called Nissan 
and a brand name called Ford," said Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan 
Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd. "It's not a matter of targeting origins any more. 
I don't see how this could be possible." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, a former Ford man, joined Nissan in 1984 and replaced a Japanese top 
executive at the Sunderland plant a year ago. He said that Nissan is carrying 
out an intensive program to localize itself as a "European company," much as 
Ford did over the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first Bluebirds were about 40% local parts when Nissan began 
assembling them here in 1986, Gibson said that when Nissan UK's new mid-sized 
Primera goes into production later this year, perhaps 80% of it will be from 
European suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that the vehicle is going to be so localized that, in the end, 
we'll have no trouble with the Europeans," Gibson said. "By the late 1990s, 
we'll be designing our own models." 
</P>
<P>
Nissan has established a research and development facility, and British 
engineers already have adapted some of the design elements of the Primera to 
the European market. They are working on a four-wheel-drive vehicle that would 
be the first "Japanese" automobile fully designed in Europe. Only its engine 
and transmission are to be designed -- and made -- in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The plant employs about 2,500 people in Sunderland, a depressed shipbuilding 
town in northeast England. About 30% of the assembly workers were unemployed 
when Nissan hired them, and the plant is rapidly expanding. Plans are to hire 
1,000 more workers by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's goal is to build 100,000 Primeras in 1991 and add another model in 
1992, to double production to 200,000 units a year. By 1993, half of these cars 
will be going to other EC countries. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker and the third largest worldwide, is in hot 
pursuit. Last spring, it announced plans to build a $1.2-billion plant in 
Derbyshire to produce 200,000 cars by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Honda has teamed up with Britain's Rover Group to build a $540-million plant in 
Swindon with 100,000-unit capacity. Mitsubishi Motors has said it will forge a 
"cooperative relationship" with West Germany's Daimler-Benz, and Mazda has 
announced plans to build cars in Europe with Ford. 
</P>
<P>
With sales unlikely to grow in the saturated car markets both home and in North 
America, the Japanese are counting on selling more autos in post-1992 Europe, 
where they currently hold a combined market share of about 10%. Having learned 
some hard lessons about trade friction with the United States, they see local 
production as the only certain means of expanding volume. 
</P>
<P>
This strategy has been regarded with no small amount of hostility, especially 
in France, home to two of Europe's four largest auto manufacturers, Peugeot and 
Renault. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese car makers' "final aim" is to "conquer market share and then kill," 
Edith Cresson, French minister for European affairs, told reporters after an EC 
ministerial meeting in Brussels earlier this year. She cited the U.S. market, 
of which the Japanese have a 25% share, as an example of the clear and present 
danger for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Japanese want to invest, that's fine," Cresson said, "but they won't 
invest, once they have destroyed the market." 
</P>
<P>
The split within the EC over Japanese cars reflects deeper divisions over 
economic philosophy and on European unity. Last month, Nicholas Ridley, then 
British minister of trade and industry, caused a furor by comparing the EC 
Commission to Hitler and calling market integration a "German racket designed 
to take over the whole of Europe." Ridley was quickly forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The awkwardness over Japanese automobiles, however, shows no sign of fading 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The EC's external affairs commissioner, Frans Andriessen, was expected to begin 
preliminary negotiations with the Japanese this summer to iron out a voluntary 
restraint agreement that would temporarily protect the European auto industry 
from Japanese imports after 1992. Five EC countries -- including Britain -- 
have quotas on cars shipped from Japan, and these would eventually be phased 
out, perhaps over five years. 
</P>
<P>
But the signals the EC put out earlier in June, suggesting that offshore car 
production would be included in any voluntary-restraint quotas, drew howls of 
protest in Tokyo. The discord appears to have delayed negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese industry is obviously confused," said John Lawson, an auto 
analyst for the Nomura Research Institute in London. "It thought it had a 
strategy for 1992, but now it can no longer rely on localization as a means of 
satisfying Europe's requirements. This is a classic case of moving the goal 
posts." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lake, spokesman for the EC, said he is not sure exactly what the EC's 
position will be when formal talks begin. Other than the "apparent consensus" 
announced in June, nothing official has been decided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's messy," Lake said. "I wish things were more clear-cut." 
</P>
<P>
Confounding the issue is the double standard that spares U.S. auto makers from 
the fear and loathing being focused on the Japanese. To be sure, car imports to 
Europe from the United States are few, but only because the Americans are well 
established within Europe after decades of localization. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody takes Ford as being a non-British company. It's been here so long, it's 
a standard brand name to us," said David Morris, an analyst with the 
Anglo-Japanese Economic Institute, which is supported by the Tokyo government. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's still a residual sense of suspicion about why the Japanese are 
investing here," Morris said. "There's almost an unspoken assumption that there 
must be something underhanded behind it." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate test of what constitutes a "Japanese car" may come later this 
year. Honda has said it plans to start shipping Accord station wagons -- made 
at its factory in Ohio -- to the European market. Perhaps Honda figures that 
its American-made cars will not run into the same obstacles as those from 
Britain.

IN CZARIST TIMES, COMMODITY EXCHANGES WERE THE CENTERPIECE OF THE RUSSIAN

COLLAPSE OF THE STATE-CONTROLLED ECONOMY.

How many pounds of fresh meat does a new computer cost? How can Moscow's 
collective farmers get videotape recorders, instead of almost worthless rubles, 
for their vegetables? And where can a builder get plumbing fixtures when the 
state supply agency has stopped selling them? 
</P>
<P>
As the Soviet Union's economic breakdown accelerates, its state-managed, 
centrally planned system is less and less able to meet the needs of either 
producers or consumers, and the country is facing increasing economic paralysis 
as products of all sorts no longer reach their intended users and the Soviet 
ruble loses its value as a currency. 
</P>
<P>
"The centralized system we have had for decades for planned production, 
allocation and distribution has collapsed, simply collapsed," said Gennady M. 
Poleshuk, a Soviet economist-turned-businessman. "The present situation is 
extraordinary -- goods are still being produced, demand for them is still 
present, but retail and wholesale outlets are virtually empty and consumer 
frustration has long ago boiled up into anger." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, simply put, is that the Soviet Union's transition from a planned 
to a market economy is stalled. The old system, which had long ceased to 
function effectively, is disintegrating much faster than its replacement is 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
"Markets must grow -- they cannot be planned or pre-structured," Poleshuk said. 
"But they do not grow overnight, and they do need some nurturing. . . . We say 
we want to develop a market economy, but where will the market come from? How 
does it grow?" 
</P>
<P>
Poleshuk's answer to that question is one of the boldest of the reforms now 
under way here -- the establishment of a series of commodities exchanges, 
trading marts where all sorts of goods, ranging from agricultural produce to 
construction materials, from computers to consumer goods, can be bought and 
sold at freely negotiated prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We can cut through most of the theoretical debate and get to the core of the 
problem by responding to the market," Poleshuk said in an interview. "The 
market already exists, but it is hidden and rather savage and primitive. 
</P>
<P>
"To cope with the collapse of the state-managed system, enterprises are already 
exchanging products directly, sometimes by barter, sometimes at absolutely wild 
commercial prices, sometimes for hard currency. We should move, as a step that 
we can accomplish virtually today, to get this trade into the open as a basis 
for a market economy." 
</P>
<P>
Poleshuk, co-chairman of a planned Moscow Commodities Exchange and the director 
of a Soviet-Yugoslav-Italian construction venture, said that perhaps as much as 
15% of overall Soviet sales already take place outside state channels and that 
this volume could quickly double and even treble as the government withdraws 
from day-to-day management of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to use trade in three or four types of commodities to establish a 
market where buyers and sellers know what the supply-and-demand situation is, 
what the prices are and where they can deal," Poleshuk said. "In economic 
terms, this is a very, very basic market, but we have to go back to where we 
left off 70 years ago and reestablish what we had." 
</P>
<P>
Commodities exchanges were at the center of the Russian economy as it began to 
industrialize at the turn of the century; businessmen not only traded in 
commodities there but raised investment funds through the sale of bonds and 
shares in their enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the exchanges continued to operate under V. I. Lenin, the 
founder of the Soviet state, after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. But they were 
closed by Josef Stalin with the establishment of centralized state planning and 
management of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Although no one remains who remembers exactly how they worked, we still have a 
feeling of affinity for this type of economic organization," said Poleshuk, 36, 
a research economist who came to Moscow three years ago with many other 
reform-minded academics from Siberia. "A commodities exchange seems more 
Russian, less foreign, and thus more acceptable. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We also expect that in its second phase it will have a department, which is 
being organized by Moscow's new commercial banks, for trading in stocks, bonds 
and other equities. This again is a Russian tradition -- keeping the capital 
market within the commodities exchange and linking them directly." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Commodities Exchange plans to open in borrowed quarters next month, 
with sales of goods in four high-demand areas -- construction materials, metal 
products, agricultural produce and high-tech goods, including computers and 
audio-visual equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Poleshuk projects that the turnover in the first year could be as high as 3 
billion rubles, which would be the equivalent of $4.8 billion at official 
exchange rates -- but about $200 million at the prevailing black market rate 
for the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we will be a place for buyers and sellers to meet and do business," 
Poleshuk said. "A person with, say, a shipment of wallpaper to sell will know 
that on a certain day at a specified time there will be trading in building 
materials, and he has a pretty good chance to find a customer and probably more 
than just one customer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our wallpaper manufacturer can then take other goods in exchange or sell for 
rubles or for dollars. It all will depend on the buyer and the seller, what the 
demand is like and what the supply is like. Such deals already take place in 
scores of different ways and through an informal but active network, but we 
want to assemble them in one place to create a critical mass that will gather 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
As volume grows, the exchange will probably develop some kind of currency, a 
"commodity ruble," or accounting unit, to make it easier for meatpackers to buy 
computers and for collective farmers to buy video recorders, which are now 
among the most-prized possessions of a Soviet family. 
</P>
<P>
"Three carloads of lumber might be exchanged initially for one computer or one 
carload of meat," Poleshuk said, "so there is already a price exchange. We 
might say 1,000 commodity rubles equals three carloads of lumber or one 
computer or one carload of meat. 
</P>
<P>
"As the deals multiply, realistic 'exchange rates' and prices will appear. We 
need to go through the natural period of developing a market. This is an 
economic reality, but I admit it's not Marxist." 
</P>
<P>
Poleshuk said he expects that Soviet factories, under increasing pressure to 
become profitable, will begin to sell off their large stockpiles of goods and 
raw materials, often equivalent to a full year's production, in order to boost 
their revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprises will also have an active, new market for additional production. 
Although officially encouraged to produce more, few factories have, because 
they often had no way to sell the goods outside state channels. 
</P>
<P>
Poleshuk anticipates that cooperatively owned Soviet enterprises, which now 
number in the thousands, will quickly turn to the exchange to buy materials 
they cannot obtain from state agencies and to sell much more of their goods on 
a wholesale basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises are supposed to have been freed from the state bureaucracy, but in 
fact they are still enmeshed in it because they have no real market where they 
can buy and sell," Poleshuk said. 
</P>
<P>
And he believes that the exchange will quickly establish market prices for many 
products that currently sell for much more or much less than their real worth. 
</P>
<P>
With the use of foreign currencies in some deals and direct foreign 
participation possible, the exchange will also quickly establish the true value 
of the Soviet ruble, which is pegged officially at $1.60 but is sold to 
tourists at 16 cents each and can be bought on the black market for 5 or 6 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
"Freeing the prices of 10%, then 30% and then perhaps 45% of the total turnover 
in the country will bring us into price reform," he said. "And price reform, 
based on true costs and real demand, will be the great economic rationalizer." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Commodity Exchange, a project of half a dozen diverse groups, 
including the Moscow city government, the Soviet Assn. of Young Managers and 
the Soviet Union of Construction and Industrial Cooperatives, is likely to be a 
key participant in efforts by radical reformers to push development of a market 
economy faster than the central government up to now has wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Gavriil Popov, a leading advocate of the establishment of a market economy here 
and the new mayor of Moscow, is providing the exchange with the political 
patronage that will be necessary when it challenges the entrenched state 
agencies that have long exercised total power over the manufacture, 
distribution and sale of everything from shoelaces to steel. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem the Moscow Commodities Exchange faces is a shortage of 
experienced and talented personnel. Poleshuk said he hopes to recruit 35 to 40 
people and to send most of them to exchanges in the West for training. He also 
hopes to develop a brokerage system, opening his own brokerage in time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have book knowledge of how this is all going to work, but we don't yet have 
the habits and skills, the hands-on experience, that are needed to ensure its 
success," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange will be financed by the 3 million rubles ($4.8 million at the 
official exchange rate) invested by the founding groups, the sales of bonds to 
investors and of memberships to enterprises wishing to participate, sales of 
places to regular sellers and buyers, and from fees charged on the turnover and 
collected from occasional participants. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect this will be a highly profitable business," he said, "but we are 
going to need a fair amount of capital to expand our activities and underwrite 
the start of the stocks and bonds department." 
</P>
<P>
Other exchanges are being organized in Leningrad, where trading will start in 
the autumn in as many as 13 commodities, in the Ukrainian city of Lvov, where 
the products will range from textiles and televisions to buses and loading 
equipment, and in about 10 other Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
Early next year, the central government plans to organize a Western-style 
commodities exchange for grain sales and purchases. It will initially trade in 
contracts for deliveries of wheat and barley, of which the Soviet Union is the 
world's largest producer, and later of other grains. 
</P>
<P>
"Development of commodity exchanges happened all over the world several 
thousand years ago," Poleshuk said, "but we have to do it all over again in the 
Soviet Union."

<P>
The CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency offered a bleak assessment of the 
Soviet economy in an April, 1990, report to a Joint Economic Committee of 
Congress. Some conclusions from the report: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Widespread breakdowns in the transportation and distribution networks 
interfered with the delivery7 of all kinds of goods from producers to 
consumers, causing goods to pile up in freignt cars and warehouses instead of 
reaching store shelves." 
</P>
<P>
"State enterprises . . . often found themselves scrambling to obtain whatever 
supplies they could from a fledgling wholesale trade system that was not ready 
for the burden." 
</P>
<P>
"Last August a Soviet survey of state stores found that only 200 of 1,200 
standard consumer goods were readily available; by the end of the year, the 
number of readily available items fell to 50." 
</P>
<P>
"Special distribution systems, notably food sales at workplaces, also helped 
individuals with access to obtain scarce consumer goods. The rapid expansion of 
these special channels, however, reduced the flow of goods to the general 
public." 
</P>
<P>
"Freign shipments by all carriers fell by 116 million tons last year, a 2% drop 
from the previous year and one of the transport sector's worst annual 
performances in decades . . . Nearly half of all the nation's railroads failed 
to meet freight shipment targets."

AN AFRICAN FORCE HEADS FOR LIBERIA

The News: 
</P>
<P>
Five West African nations are sending a military task force to Liberia in a 
regional effort to end that country's seven-month civil war, which has cost 
more than 5,000 lives and turned 400,000 persons into refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Togo -- all, ironically, headed by 
military governments and operating under the banner of the Economic Community 
of West African States -- are commiting troops to a task force totaling some 
2,500 men. It is expected to land in Liberia sometime this week to a reception 
that is at best uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The besieged, 10-year-old government of Samuel Kanyon Doe has said it welcomes 
the intervention. So has Prince Johnson, the leader of one of two principal 
rebel groups now threatening the capital. But Charles Taylor, the rebel leader 
who originally challenged Doe, has threatened to oppose the mission by force 
and has mounted a new offensive in a drive to take power before the outside 
troops arrive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background: 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a former Cabinet minister in Doe's government, invaded Liberia on 
Christmas Eve, 1989, from neighboring Ivory Coast with a rump force of about 
200 ex-army men, most of them lightly armed. The rebel leader and some of his 
men had received training in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion was given little chance of unseating Doe until the president 
reacted by sending troops into rural areas to attack civilians of the Gio and 
Mano tribes, supporters of Taylor. By the time the force reached the Liberia 
coast and approached the capital of Monrovia, it was thousands strong, and the 
panicky, ill-trained government army was melting away. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's splinter group of rebels was the first to make headway into Monrovia, 
but it has since become bogged down by opposition from the government and by a 
sideshow battle with Taylor's forces. 
</P>
<P>
What was billed as Doe's last stand has now lasted more than two months, as his 
army -- probably fearful of reprisals if either Taylor or Johnson wins -- has 
fought with unexpected resolve in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Players: 
</P>
<P>
Samuel K. Doe was a lowly master sergeant when he seized power in April, 1980, 
from elected President William R. 
</P>
<P>
Tolbert, who was part of a Liberian elite descended from the freed American 
slaves who founded the country in 1847. Tolbert died in the coup, and in the 
next few days Doe executed 13 former ministers. Since then he has presided over 
the collapse of the Liberian economy and over a farcically incompetent and 
violent government. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor was head of the General Services Agency, the government 
purchasing arm, and a deputy minister for commerce under Doe when he fled the 
country to the U.S. after a falling out. He was arrested in Boston at the 
request of Doe, who charged him with embezzling nearly $1 million from the GSA. 
(Associates believe he did steal heavily.) He told friends he escaped from U.S. 
custody by bribing prison guards with $30,000. "Everybody hates Doe so much -- 
that's why Charles Taylor, who doesn't have a popular following, can succeed," 
says one acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Johnson was a lieutenant in Doe's army but defected when Doe stole the 
1985 presidential 
</P>
<P>
election, joining a coup attempt by former army officer Thomas Qwiwonkpa. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the relative troop strengths of the three antagonists vary widely, 
but certainly number no more than a few thousand fighters each. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Task Force: 
</P>
<P>
The five-nation task force is charged with imposing and monitoring a cease-fire 
in Monrovia and setting the stage for free elections within a year. Doe, Taylor 
and Johnson will all be asked to lay down their arms and wouldn't be permitted 
to join an interim government. 
</P>
<P>
Of the task force participants, Guinea and Sierra Leone are Liberian neighbors, 
Ghana and Togo have many nationals working within Liberia's borders, and 
Nigeria is the region's military powerhouse. Nigeria's president Ibrahim 
Babangida, however, has also been a close friend of the Doe regime. 
Accordingly, Nigeria's share of the task force was scaled back lest it inspire 
suspicion among Liberians. 
</P>
<P>
The entire mission is under the command of a Ghanaian. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some prominent Liberian exiles have expressed concerns about the resolve 
of five military governments to reestablish civilian rule in Liberia. "It's 
bound to be tricky," says one. 
</P>
<P>
The task force may be a budget-buster for its destitute African members. Early 
estimates place the price at $50 million or more, jeopardizing internationally 
imposed austerity measures in Sierra Leone and other countries. Nigeria has 
already requested financial and logistics aid from the U.S. and European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The U.S. View: 
</P>
<P>
America's special relationship with Liberia dates back to the West African 
country's independence in 1847 as the creation of a group of freed U.S. slaves. 
The United States has operated Voice of America transmitter stations in the 
country, financed many major projects and generally propped up its regimes. 
Huge concessions to grow rubber and mine iron ore were granted to American 
corporations, although now the iron mines are depleted and the giant Firestone 
rubber plantation, the world's largest, changed hands when Firestone was 
purchased by Japan-based Bridgestone some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Outlook: 
</P>
<P>
Given the savagery of this year's inter-tribal conflict, few Liberians believe 
peace can come to their country without the help of an outside force. The 
2,500-man task force may not be strong enough to do its job, however, 
particularly if Taylor makes good on his threat to oppose the mission. 
</P>
<P>
To many Liberians, the top priority is simply to somehow get rid of Doe. "With 
him out, there's a good chance for a cessation of hostilities," says Amos 
Sawyer, a former politician and University of Liberia dean now in exile in the 
United States.

MADNESS IN THE MARSHES: HUSSEIN'S LAST WAR; 
</P>
<P>
THE IRAQI LEADER'S TACTICS WERE SURGICALLY PRECISE IN THE SPRING OF 1984. 
THOUSANDS OF IRANIAN TROOPS PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

"Majnoon" is what they call the marshes on the border that divides Iran and 
Iraq just below the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. It's the 
Arabic word for "madness." And in the spring of 1984, when the Majnoon marshes 
became the latest battlefield in the prolonged Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein redefined the word. 
</P>
<P>
As one of only a handful of European and American journalists who managed to 
reach the actual fighting at the time, I watched Hussein's army slaughter 
thousands of Iranian soldiers in a rare and little-known military operation 
that combined high technology, hatred and the horrors of war into a blend of 
brutality almost beyond comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
What we saw was vintage Saddam Hussein, the efficient and surgical military 
muscle that made the Persian Gulf War one of the bloodiest in the history of 
man and made Hussein himself the most awesome leader in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
And it left behind haunting images that now help define America's newest enemy 
in the Middle East and graphically underscore the ruthless dedication of his 
million-strong war machine. 
</P>
<P>
The Battle of Majnoon wasn't nearly as widely documented as Hussein's use of 
vast chemical weapons arsenals on Iraq's rebellious Kurds, whose poisoned 
bodies littering the roadsides have been shown time and again on Western 
television during the past 10 days. Nor was it as well publicized as the Iraqi 
leader's devastating "War of the Cities" missile attacks on schools, homes and 
mosques throughout Iran during the eight-year war. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there were very few shots fired, and only a handful of artillery 
barrages. They were hardly needed, given the creative killing methods devised 
by the Iraqi army for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"You wait until nighttime, and you will see how we are killing these Iranian 
dogs," an Iraqi officer said with a broad grin. "We are frying them like 
eggplants." 
</P>
<P>
He then took us on a tour of dozens of thick electrical cables his troops had 
lain through the marshy battlefield, a spaghetti network that snaked in and out 
of the patchwork of lagoons. He showed us the mammoth electric generators that 
fed the exposed power lines from positions just behind the Iraqi front lines. 
And, when the Iranian Revolutionary Guards made their regular evening advance, 
the officer and his men demonstrated the macabre genius of their invention. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi gun batteries fired just enough artillery to force the Revolutionary 
Guards from their marsh boats, and, when hundreds of them had been forced to 
continue their advance through the lagoons on foot, the men manning the Iraqi 
generators flipped a few switches and sent thousands of volts of electricity 
surging through the marshland. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, hundreds of Iranians were electrocuted. 
</P>
<P>
But the horror show did not end there. The following morning, Iraqi troops 
began another grisly routine that the officer called "the morning road detail." 
</P>
<P>
They made their way through the marshes, gathering up the dead Iranian soldiers 
like dynamite fishermen harvesting a day's catch. Working methodically, the 
Iraqis piled the corpses on top of one another in the water in head-to-toe 
stacks, five bodies high and five across. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the human piles formed long rows, the width of a troop truck, the top 
layers above the water's surface. Each row extended in a straight line through 
the marshes from the Iraqis' positions toward the Iranian border. Finally, the 
rows were sprinkled with lime and covered over with a foot-thick tier of desert 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Iraqi method of road building, using the bodies of their enemies to 
construct assault routes for tanks and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
There are other grisly anecdotes from the Iran-Iraq War that help define Saddam 
Hussein -- glimpses of an enigmatic leader who in the last 12 days has sealed 
his nation to all outside journalists and crafted his image through Iraqi 
government television clips. 
</P>
<P>
For Saddam Hussein, a teen-aged assassin who led his splinter faction of the 
Arab Baath Party to power in a ruthless July 30, 1968, coup, the pursuit of 
physical power and military might has been as much a characteristic as his 
penchant for security. 
</P>
<P>
During three meetings with Hussein in small press conferences or interviews in 
1984, I was led through three metal detectors each time and thoroughly 
body-searched twice by his personal guards. Throughout the rambling sessions, 
Hussein turned answers into political diatribes and always referred to himself 
in the third person. 
</P>
<P>
Every trip he made outside his presidential palace was an unscheduled, surprise 
visit. Foreign journalists were never permitted to accompany him. And he would 
travel in a convoy in which several limousines were used as decoys. 
</P>
<P>
It was during another rural journey through the Iraqi countryside that it 
became clear Hussein's troops were capable of using on their own people the 
very same ruthlessness they show their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
There were three of us that day, journalists from the United States, Britain 
and Canada, traveling by civilian bus on an unauthorized trip from the capital 
of Baghdad to the southernmost war-front city of Basra. Every 20 or 30 miles, 
our bus was stopped at military checkpoints. At first, we were afraid for 
ourselves. We were traveling out of Baghdad without permission. But, each time, 
the soldiers who boarded the bus approached us only with genuine smiles and 
awkward greetings in broken English. And each time, they left the bus with 
several young men in civilian clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at a checkpoint near Basra, we learned all too clearly the purpose of 
the searches. 
</P>
<P>
A young man who had been pulled off the bus by the troops turned suddenly from 
the checkpoint and started running from the soldiers. As we watched through the 
bus window, three of the soldiers calmly knelt, took aim and shot him several 
times in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the horror in our eyes, an elderly passenger sitting nearby turned to 
us, brushed the air with her hand, as if swatting away a fly, and said, 
"Deserter."

San Diego State launched its new marketing campaign Monday in an attempt to 
increase attendance at Aztec home football games. 
</P>
<P>
The theme is "Welcome to the School of Hard Knocks," and the campaign includes 
promotions for each of the Aztecs' six home games as well as schedule posters 
and cards with the "Clash Schedule" and a special mailing to SDSU alumni 
encouraging them to purchase season football tickets by enrolling in the 
"Aztecs' Refresher Course -- Six Saturdays, No Final Exam." 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to add to the fun of an Aztec football evening with promotions 
and activities around each home game," said Jayne Hancock, associate director 
of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, here is the SDSU home schedule, along with corresponding 
promotions: 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 15, Cal State Long Beach -- Fans will receive a free slice of pizza if 
the 49ers and Aztecs combine to score higher than Cal State Long Beach Coach 
George Allen's age (72). There will be George Allen trivia contests throughout 
the game on the DiamondVision scoreboard, fireworks after the game, and mascot 
Monty Montezuma's new pregame entrance will debut on this night. 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 29, Air Force -- There will be a paper airplane toss before the game. 
Hit a target, win a prize. There will also be a postgame concert. 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 3, Utah -- Homecoming and free pompons. 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 10, Hawaii -- It's beach party night. Fans will be asked to wear beach 
clothes, which will make them look like the band. The scoreboard will feature 
beach music and beach movie clips. 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 24, Texas-El Paso -- A country carnival will begin at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium at 3 p.m. The scoreboard will feature country and western music 
and Western movie clips. 
</P>
<P>
* Dec. 1, Miami -- This is "Salute to College Football Night," and a fireworks 
and laser show will take place after the game against defending national 
champion Miami.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: SOUTHLAND PARKING HEYDAY MAY BE ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
They now charge an average of $140 a month to park a car in a downtown Los 
Angeles office building. For short visits, the average hourly rate is $4.70 and 
rising -- provided you can find a place. Who can afford these prices for 
something that used to be so cheap and plentiful? 
</P>
<P>
Calm down a little. In San Francisco, the average monthly downtown parking cost 
is $257, and in New York it's . . . well, don't even ask. 
</P>
<P>
In parking, as in other things, Los Angeles is catching up with other 
"world-class cities." Another element of our dusty pueblo's bill of rights -- 
the right to park inexpensively -- is biting the dust. The most dramatic prices 
for commercial parking are posted downtown, but the pinch is being felt all 
over Southern California -- from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley, and from 
Irvine to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Why? The same old broken record: We're in the big time now. Congested, heavily 
populated and very busy. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown Los Angeles used to have a huge number of surface parking lots that 
provided cheap and available parking," said William Francis, whose Western 
Parking Services surveys the state of parking here. "With all the new 
development, we are losing those lots. We've actually added more parking in the 
process, but it's the much more expensive kind in underground garages and 
multistory structures." 
</P>
<P>
Parking and its cost have a little-understood but important influence on the 
economy. As long as parking is cheap and easy, people in this area will drive 
their cars everywhere. Smog regulators try to cut back parking for just that 
reason. Meantime, politicians and planners try to add off-street parking to 
reduce congestion. The result: mixed signals from the policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is clear: Cheap parking helps business and contributes to Southern 
California's reputation as a retail paradise. It makes possible four stops 
instead of one on a Saturday shopping excursion. No schlepping of packages on 
crowded subways here; we put them in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
And it's also clear that parking is another of our growth industries. In Los 
Angeles, business taxes paid by parking operators, which are assessed as a 
percentage of revenue, soared nearly 400% in the past 10 years. And the city 
expects to collect $22.5 million a year from its 10% retail tax on commercial 
parking, which went into effect just this month. 
</P>
<P>
If parking becomes too expensive, people here may still drive -- but to fewer 
places. And that undoubtedly will influence the pace of economic activity, at 
least the way it's been practiced in Southern California since the arrival of 
the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, more than half the employers in Los Angeles are forced to 
subsidize parking costs to keep their employees and customers happy, and that 
has become part of the higher cost of doing business here that everybody 
complains about. If they don't subsidize parking, a lot of companies can't find 
employees who are able to pay the full amount or are willing to shift to the 
region's inadequate and inconvenient public transit. 
</P>
<P>
But let's back up. It took more than the automobile to turn the Southland into 
the motoring capital; it also took lots of free parking. Southern Californians 
have always hated to pay for parking. They barked and whined when parking 
meters arrived in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
And 35 years ago, if you charged 5 cents an hour to park in most lots, "people 
wouldn't stand for it," said parking veteran Stanley Long, president of the 
Parking Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
So the region grew up with a tradition of cheap and plentiful parking, and that 
tradition has evolved into an expectation for those who come here now. But as 
population and development increase, the economics of parking is changing 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire-Thomas Partners, one of the region's biggest managers of office 
buildings, figures that it costs $12,000 to $20,000 to put one parking stall in 
a downtown office building these days, according to senior partner Ned Fox. A 
recent study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments estimated that the 
cost of land, construction, operation and maintenance adds up to $270 a month 
for each parking space in a new Los Angeles skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shielding people from the real costs," said Donald C. Shoup, a UCLA 
urban planning professor who co-authored the SCAG study. "Most people don't 
realize how expensive it has become to provide new parking spaces." 
</P>
<P>
This "shielding" is a direct result of our tradition of cheap parking. That 
tradition also created the widespread subsidization of employee parking costs 
in Southern California. The SCAG study discovered that the amount that downtown 
employers pay to lower the cost of parking ranges from $59 to $121 per month 
per employee. What that means is few people are actually paying that whopping 
$140 a month for downtown monthly parking. The employers share much of the 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies also come as "free" validation by retailers and some professionals 
for customers who use commercial parking lots. Nobody has estimated how much 
that costs business. 
</P>
<P>
In other big cities, parking is not a right. In San Francisco and New York, 
there have been few minimum requirements for off-street parking in new office 
buildings. Most of the cars that park in the relatively few spots available are 
those of short-term visitors, not all-day employees. By contrast, about 
three-quarters of the cars that park in downtown Los Angeles belong to 
employees who work there, not visitors or customers. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, we require at least one parking space per 1,000 square 
feet of space in a new office building. In some parts of the region, the 
requirements are much tougher. Beverly Hills, for instance, requires three 
spaces per 1,000 square feet. And politicians, responding to outcries from 
residents seeking to reduce street parking congestion, have raised the 
requirements for new buildings in a number of other areas. The idea, one 
planner says, is to prevent the Melrose Avenue or Ventura Boulevard syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
We have subsidies and minimum parking standards because people here demanded 
them. We like our traditions. But the changed economics of parking is already 
fencing us in. The high cost of land and construction is making parking too 
expensive to permit employees to park all day for next to nothing -- or 
shoppers and visitors to gallivant. 
</P>
<P>
And that may finally do something that exhortations from smog abaters, high 
gasoline prices and billions of dollars spent on buses and Blue Lines haven't: 
make us drive less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GROWTH INDUSTRY 
</P>
<P>
Business taxes paid by Los Angeles parking operators, which are assessed as a 
percentage of revenue, soared nearly 400% in the past 10 years.

World map -- In a map in Monday's editions, accompanying text boxes, listing 
countries under various regions, located a number of places in the wrong 
geographical areas. Colombia should have been listed as being in South America, 
Oman in the Middle East, Belize in Central America, Mexico in North America and 
Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. Turkey, most of which is considered part of 
Asia, was included under Western Europe because it is listed there in the 
Pentagon's figures on worldwide personnel strength.

A fast-moving forest fire threatened up to 1,600 homes in Northern California 
today, and a state of emergency was declared for the county where fires have 
blackened parts of Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in some of these areas may get worse before it gets better," 
Gov. George Deukmejian said when he declared the state of emergency for 
Mariposa County late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 major fires in the state, the biggest was the Campbell Complex that 
had burned about 114,000 acres in Tehama County. 
</P>
<P>
But the top priority for firefighters was a smaller Tehama County fire, the 
Finley Lake fire east of Red Bluff, that at one point threatened as many as 400 
homes in Manton, 200 in Mineral, and an additional 1,000 in the general area. 
It had burned 17,500 acres, officials said.

Syrian troops arrived in Saudi Arabia today and a second Iraqi ship was kept 
out of a Persian Gulf port as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's adversaries 
tightened their economic and military vise. 
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, officials said ships bound to or from Iraq will be allowed to use the 
Suez Canal. They said the 1888 Constantinople Convention permits denial of 
transit only to ships of a nation at war with Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
A mine alert was posted for a central gulf channel where an Iraqi ship was seen 
Monday, but it was canceled later, shipping sources reported. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were watching a ship suspected of carrying Polish-made small 
arms destined for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, said the first Syrian units landed 
in the early morning to join American, British, Egyptian and other forces 
protecting the Arabian Peninsula and its vast oil reserves. The sources had no 
details of numbers or areas where the soldiers would be deployed. 
</P>
<P>
President Hafez Assad of Syria is an old enemy of Hussein, his main foe in Arab 
ranks, and supported Iran in its eight-year war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Damascus, the Syrian capital, have been reluctant to discuss 
participation in the multinational force and would not confirm the Riyadh 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
American GIs in Saudi Arabia today told Pentagon pool reporters that they are 
prepared for chemical arms attack from Iraq, which has used the weapons before 
and reportedly tried to buy nerve gas protection kits for its own troops just 
days before storming Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The 82nd Airborne paratroopers said they were ready for anything Iraq could 
launch, including a gas warfare attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trained for it," a paratrooper from Ann Arbor, Mich., said. "If it 
happens, we're ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
The United States put missile-firing helicopters, tanks and anti-tank missiles 
into place in the desert today. 
</P>
<P>
The Army's new Apache helicopters, equipped with Hellfire anti-armor missiles, 
have been sent to Saudi Arabia primarily to fight tanks if necessary, the 
Apache battalion's commander said.

The Army went on a shopping spree at the Hinesville K mart last week and got a 
blue-light special on more than 24,000 items. 
</P>
<P>
K mart Manager Wesley Bennefield said officials at Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, which began sending troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia over the 
weekend, telephoned him Friday to order items essential for the desert: 2,400 
cans of bug spray, 5,550 bottles of skin lotion, 5,550 tubes of lip balm, 5,550 
containers of foot powder and 5,550 bottles of suntan lotion. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a real treat. I've spent three days on the telephone," said 
Bennefield, who had most of the items shipped to the base Sunday night from K 
mart's Atlanta warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Army also ordered an item the local K mart doesn't carry: 174,000 gallons 
of bottled water. Bennefield said he had rounded up 84,000 gallons from 
bottled-water companies as of this morning and was trying to find the rest.

RABBI SETTLER JAILED IN ARAB'S KILLING FREED

<P>
Jewish settler leader Rabbi Moshe Levinger left jail today after serving 13 
weeks of a five-month sentence for killing an Arab man and said he would shoot 
again if he thought it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of supporters and two legislators from the right-wing Likud Party 
greeted Levinger on his release from the minimum-security Nir prison. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators lifted Levinger on their shoulders and began dancing in 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Levinger was convicted by a Jerusalem District Court in April of causing the 
shooting death of Kayed Sallah, 42, through negligence. He plea-bargained to 
reduce the charge of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sept. 30, 1988, incident in the West Bank town of Hebron, Levinger fired 
his pistol indiscriminately after Palestinians stoned his car. Sallah, who was 
standing in front of the shoe store he owned, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The ultra-nationalist rabbi said he fired in self-defense because Arab 
protesters stoned his car. But witnesses said he rampaged through Hebron's Arab 
market -- overturning stalls and shooting wildly -- well after the stoning. 
</P>
<P>
Levinger vowed today to open fire again if he believed he was in a 
life-threatening situation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm in a situation of danger again, I'll again open fire," Levinger said on 
Israel radio. "I hope that next time, I will be more careful and I won't miss 
the target." 
</P>
<P>
Levinger served 92 days of his term and was released early for "good behavior," 
Prison Authority spokeswoman Shuli Meiri said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the left-wing Mapam Party demonstrated outside the prison to protest 
Levinger's early release, scuffling with Levinger's supporters.

IRAQ LOOTING OF KUWAITI GOODS, TREASURY TOLD;

IRAQ SEIZURE OF $4 BILLION FROM KUWAIT ALLEGED

<P>
Iraq has appropriated $3 billion to $4 billion in gold bullion, cash and 
military and civilian goods from Kuwaiti financial and commercial institutions 
since taking over the country, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, quoting Arab bankers in the Persian Gulf and London, said 
the transfer of the goods to Baghdad appreciably increased Iraq's financial 
reserves, estimated by Arab and British bankers at $6.5 billion before Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis also confiscated huge amounts of civilian and military airplanes, 
automobiles, machinery, food and other goods, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about gold, cash, cars, airplanes, tankers and a lot of military 
hardware that fell intact into the hands of the Iraqis on the first days of the 
invasion," the newspaper quoted an unidentified Middle Eastern banker as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, London, Abu Dhabi and Dubai reported the 
invasion has sent shock waves through the regional economy in the form of 
capital flight, rising insurance rates, inflation and a cash shortage among 
people trapped by the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Many Arab investors and foreigners are trying to transfer their money abroad, 
particularly to Switzerland and other Western nations, the report said. Arab 
central banks have imposed measures to insure that the flight of hundreds of 
millions of dollars remains orderly and does not become a panic. 
</P>
<P>
Shipping insurance rates are soaring, kiting the price of all imported goods 
and raising the price of Saudi Arabian oil shipped out of the region. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a shipping executive in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, as saying war 
insurance rates have risen up to 2.5% of the value of a cargo, from a 
pre-invasion rate of zero, in some regions of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers in the area said the Kuwaiti central bank held about 2.5 million ounces 
of gold, worth about $1 billion, before the Iraqis seized it Aug. 2.

<P>
Baghdad at first installed a "provisional government of free Kuwait," which in 
turn declared a "republic" just 24 hours before Iraq's Aug. 2 annexation.

People ate more apples last year than ever despite bad publicity about 
chemicals used by growers and a slight decline in overall consumption of fresh 
fruit, Agriculture Department figures showed today. 
</P>
<P>
The department's Economic Research Service said that a large apple crop and low 
prices combined to push per capita consumption to 21.6 pounds in 1989 from 
19.87 pounds in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Bananas and apples continued to be the two most popular fresh fruits in the 
United States," the service said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, fresh fruit consumption dropped 2% last year to an average of 96.6 
pounds per person. 
</P>
<P>
Apple growers feared the worst in March, 1989, when the Natural Resources 
Defense Council said that apples treated with Alar increased the risk of cancer 
in children.

RETAIL SALES RISE A WEAK 0.1% IN JULY

<P>
Retail sales rose a weak 0.1% during July, the Commerce Department said today, 
in a sign of fading consumer buying power well before the coming oil-price 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
The slight July rise followed a revised 1.1% June increase in total sales. 
</P>
<P>
The two months of gains came after three straight months of sales declines 
between March and May and flat sales in February. 
</P>
<P>
But the July increase was even weaker than anticipated by economists, who had 
forecast a 0.4% sales rise. 
</P>
<P>
The slight pickup during July brought total sales to a seasonally adjusted 
$149.5 billion and was led by a 3.9% increase in sales of building materials 
after a 3.2% June rise. 
</P>
<P>
Auto dealer sales fell 0.6% in July after rising by 0.6% in June. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile category of auto sales, retail sales were up by 0.3% 
last month after increasing 1.2% in June, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
June retail sales originally were reported rising 0.5%, but that was revised up 
to a 1.1% gain. Aside from June, the last substantial rise in sales was in 
January, when they gained 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
But even the moderate two-month sales pickup may be short-lived because other 
indicators of economic activity show consumers trimming spending and using less 
credit as their confidence about the economy's direction wanes. 
</P>
<P>
With the impact of higher oil prices still to show up, the government said 
growth in the nation's total output of goods and services, or gross national 
product, already had slowed to an anemic 1.2% annual rate between April and 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices have risen by as much as 20 cents a gallon since the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait, and higher oil prices are expected to ripple through the 
economy, affecting many other products. 
</P>
<P>
The higher prices could lead to further reductions in spending by consumers.

Trading slowly returned to normal today after a power outage in lower Manhattan 
knocked out electricity to much of the financial district Monday. 
</P>
<P>
All the major exchanges opened, some with delays. 
</P>
<P>
But all suffered a drop-off in trading volume as Wall Street firms operated 
without some of their back-shop and computer operations due to the power 
outage. 
</P>
<P>
A large area of lower Manhattan still did not have electrical power this 
morning after the fire that cut power in much of the Wall Street area just 
after noon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,100 customers, many of them financial firms near the New York Stock 
Exchange, were still affected. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Edison said the blackout area was around the South Street Seaport, 
a market and restaurant complex surrounded by a number of Wall Street firms on 
the East Side of Manhattan's tip. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't predict when everyone will be back in service but we expect full 
restoration to take several days," the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
But on the West Side of lower Manhattan, the World Trade Center was back in 
business, as were a number of big firms surrounding the city's tallest and most 
spacious building. 
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange, which had been forced to close early on Monday, 
opened on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Exchange Inc., which houses precious metals and copper, had 
expected to open on time but later reversed course and announced delayed 
openings. 
</P>
<P>
The Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange said openings in coffee and cocoa 
futures would be delayed, while sugar contracts would open on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ over-the-counter stock market opened on time but made special 
provisions for member firms without power so they could initiate trades through 
NASDAQ computers.

Oil-producing countries could establish new pricing and production levels by 
the end of the week if agreements are reached at an emergency OPEC meeting, 
President Carlos Andres Perez said today. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela plan to propose that production be 
increased if necessary to avoid a world oil shortage, Perez said at a press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are planning an 
emergency session, but the date and location have yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in a phone conversation with Perez on Monday, repeated a plea 
for Venezuela to increase production by 500,000 barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
But Venezuela, while eager to provide the extra oil, has been holding out for 
an OPEC accord on how to replace the 4 million barrels of oil production 
blocked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

Amateur footage of CBS anchorman Dan Rather talking to sailors in the boiler 
room of the carrier Independence was offered to other networks, but there were 
no takers. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was shabby," NBC foreign editor David Miller said of the tape's 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
Rather was among network correspondents on the aircraft carrier Monday as it 
steamed in the Gulf of Oman. 
</P>
<P>
The rules of the press pool required CBS to share the footage that a sailor 
took of Rather as he explored the ship and interviewed crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the footage was fuzzy and taken in poor light. 
</P>
<P>
As Rather held the microphone, one grinning young sailor blurted out, "Hi, Mom 
and Dad."

About 50,000 East and West Germans showed up for Monday night's concert,

Lead singer Mick Jagger paced the fabled British rock group through a 2

The 28-year-old group's appearance was made possible by the 1989 demise of East

ASIAN AMERICAN ACTORS BODY HITS CASTING OF GERE AS A JAPANESE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The casting of Richard Gere as a Japanese-American in Akira Kurosawa's 
"Rhapsody in August" has been described as "far-fetched" by an Asian American 
actors group that has been sharply critical of the similar casting of a 
Caucasian in a Eurasian role in the Broadway musical "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of Asian Pacific American Artists, in a statement today acknowledged 
that in the context of Japanese cinema, the casting of Gere constitutes 
'non-traditional casting' " -- a Caucasian actor playing a Japanese role." 
</P>
<P>
But, added spokeswoman Beulah Ku, "unfortunately, it (that type of casting) is 
not being reciprocated in America." 
</P>
<P>
Ku said that AAPAA believes that Kurosawa, widely heralded as one of the 
world's leading film directors, "is giving a white actor an opportunity in 
Japan and he's doing something different. . . . Obviously (Gere got the part) 
because he is a star. He's a box-office hit." 
</P>
<P>
Reached at Kirosawa Prods. in Yokohama today, the director's son, Hisao 
Kurasawa, explained the choice of Gere matter-of-factly: "We don't need someone 
who looks Japanese. The situation of the story calls for an American . . . so 
we chose Mr. Richard Gere." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the film's co-producer, Shochiku Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, said he 
believes that such choices "are all up to the director." He said Kirosawa 
tailored the script for Gere.

IT'S BEEN all quiet on the Elizabeth Taylor front recently, but not to worry -- 
the actress has almost completely recovered from the ravages of that near-fatal 
bout with pneumonia. She and her rough-hewn construction worker love, Larry 
Fortensky, have rented a house in Malibu for the summer, in the exclusive 
Paradise Cove area, near such other biggies as Barry Diller and Jerry 
Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
The star has been throwing little barbecues and get-togethers for old and new 
friends, playing the gracious hostess and astounding everybody with her renewed 
health, high spirits and raucous, bawdy good humor. Those who have seen the 
actress recently say she looks absolutely marvelous, plump and radiant. (Some 
longtime Taylor watchers mournfully doubt she will ever again sport the size 
six figure she miraculously maintained for 4 1/2 years. I say, so what!? -- 
just so long as she doesn't run her weight up to the unhealthy level it was 
prior to her illness. Elizabeth has battled poundage her entire adult life -- 
let's give her a rest on this one.) 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is expected to make no "official" public appearances until the fall when 
she emerges for a round of AIDS fund-raisers. There are also plans for a 
dazzling new perfume launch, late this year or early in 1991. It is to be 
entirely different from her spectacularly successful Passion, the most 
profitable celebrity fragrance ever. Although Taylor's formidable press rep 
Chen Sam says nothing "definite" has happened in this area, I have it on good 
authority that Miz Liz's new scent is to be called "White Diamonds."

TYNE DALY, fresh (if that is the word) from her long, Tony-winning stage run 
with "Gypsy," returns to the small screen medium that made her a household name 
in "Cagney and Lacey." Tyne will go before the cameras Sept. 5 for an ABC-TV 
movie "The Last To Go," about a couple who are divorcing after 25 years of 
marriage. This is probably not the most pleasant acting chore Tyne has ever 
faced, as her own 20-year-plus marriage to actor Georg Stanford Brown just 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, with the subject so close to the bone, it may provide Tyne 
with a lot of fine scenery chewing and even a catharsis of sorts.

CAROL KANE can claim the distinction of appearing in the first Miramax movie to 
be released this summer that hasn't received an "X" rating. It's "The Lemon 
Sisters," also starring Diane Keaton, which opens at the end of the month. The 
big guys at Miramax are so impressed with Kane, they plan to build her up and 
develop scripts and projects for her a la Disney's top lady, Bette Midler.

Milwaukee Bucks guard Alvin Robertson was jailed on an assault charge in 
connection with a reported beating of his wife, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, 28, who played for the San Antonio Spurs for five years until 1989, 
was charged with misdemeanor assault with bodily injury, according to sheriff's 
records. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared before a magistrate Monday afternoon and was freed on an $800 
personal recognizance bond. The charge is a Class A misdemeanor carrying a 
maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's wife, Jacquelin, 29, told Bexar County sheriff's investigators that 
her husband returned home Monday morning from a trip with another woman and 
that she refused to let him into their house. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson reportedly went to the back of the house and smashed a window to get 
in. He then followed his wife to an upstairs room and later to the garage, 
where he grabbed her hand "and struck it against the concrete floor," injuring 
her, the report said.

Linebacker Junior Seau, the San Diego Chargers' top draft pick, says he's ready 
to lower his contract demands again and take a new approach to try to end his 
23-day holdout. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm still at $1.35 million a year, but there have been changes. 
</P>
<P>
It's negotiable," Seau said Monday. "We're ready to go in and approach it in 
different ways. We'll lower it, but not in the sense that we're going to give 
all our guns away." 
</P>
<P>
Seau will undoubtedly miss at least a second preseason game no matter when he 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, the fifth player chosen in the draft, has been seeking a contract worth 
more than the five-year, $6-million pact signed by Tampa Bay's Keith McCants, 
the fourth player chosen overall. 
</P>
<P>
Chargers General Manager Bobby Beathard said he's anxious to resume 
negotiations with Seau's agent, Steve Feldman, but reiterated that it would be 
pointless unless Seau dropped his asking price below the $1.2 million a year 
paid to McCants.

A state appellate court has reversed the public indecency conviction of a high 
school coach who held a meeting with some of his students wearing only a towel 
that later fell off. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Emsuer, a physical education teacher at Preble-Shawnee High School in 
Preble County, met with the students in his office next to the boys' locker 
room and which was accessible only to male students and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th Ohio District Court of Appeals held that the ordinary observer 
probably would not be offended by nudity in a men's locker room and concluded 
that the state improperly applied the public indecency statute to Emsuer's 
conduct.

</P>
<P>
Emsuer was convicted in Preble County Common Pleas Court on two counts of 
public indecency.

<P>
He was sentenced to 10 days' in jail and fined $100 on each count, with both 
penalties suspended if he performed 40 hours of community service.

Federal Arsenal and Cody won trotting championships, and Styling and Lake Hills 
Texas were crowned pacing champions Monday on the first day of the Illinois 
State Fair's five-day harness-racing meet. 
</P>
<P>
The start of Monday's 15-race card was delayed two hours by overnight rains. 
</P>
<P>
The track officially was listed as good, yet 11 of the 15 heats went in under 
2:00. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Arsenal arrived in Springfield with just one victory in seven starts 
but cruised to victory in the $53,700 event for 2-year-old trotters. 
</P>
<P>
Cody's success came as no surprise in the $42,700 race for 3-year-old trotting 
colts. Cody won two straight heats and pushed the horse's record to seven 
victories in 12 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Styling, likewise, was no surprise winner -- except that he almost didn't 
qualify for the race. After going off stride in his elimination heat and 
lagging far behind, Styling caught the leaders past the half-mile mark only to 
finish sixth -- the farthest back he could finish and still qualify for the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Styling won in 1:55.4. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Gary Williams and Michael Salter of Davenport and Bettendrorf, Iowa, 
Styling owns nine victories in 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The day's biggest upset came in the $48,000 event for 3-year-old pacers. Lake 
Hills Texas won in 1:56 and returned $58.40, 9.20 and 6.40.

IS COMMUNISM DEAD? NOT FOR JOE SLOVO; 
</P>
<P>
THE LEADER OF SOUTH AFRICA'S COMMUNIST PARTY IS NOT ABOVE RETHINKING PARTY 
DOGMA, HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks now, Joe Slovo has traveled white South Africa wrapped in his rumpled 
sports coat and fading ideology. He's been both heckled and cheered, sometimes 
in the same room. And, always, he's been pummeled with tough questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Does my mother need to worry about her Georgian furniture being nationalized?" 
a caller to a local radio talk show asked him the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Slovo replied, chuckling. "I don't particularly like Georgian 
furniture, by the way." 
</P>
<P>
Those assurances notwithstanding, whites in South Africa these days are plainly 
worried about Communist Party General Secretary Joe Slovo. They yearn to know 
whether he plans to take away their big houses, their luxury cars, their 
swimming pools and their bank accounts -- as well as their antique furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in their questions is the knowledge that this grandfatherly white 
lawyer might one day be able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Across the world, communism and socialism are losing adherents. But in South 
Africa, where the red flag has been an integral part of the black liberation 
struggle, the Communist Party has recently emerged from 40 years in hiding as a 
powerful political force. 
</P>
<P>
The party is personified by Slovo, a stocky, bespectacled 64-year-old who, 
during most of his 27 years in exile, led the African National Congress' 
revolutionary war against white minority rule. Lionized in the black townships, 
he was regarded as the most treacherous of Pretoria's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
His return to South Africa, where his words and photograph were banned for 
years, has generated deep anxiety among many of the country's 5 million whites. 
The highest-ranking white in the ANC, he's already occupying one of the 
organization's seats in peace talks with the government. And he stands to 
become one of the more influential players in the future of this country. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Slovo is putting himself and his doctrine on display in an 
extraordinary grass-roots campaign to undo the hatred and fear built up among 
whites here by four decades of red baiting, censorship, and personal attacks by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
What the citizens are seeing is not the evil revolutionary genius they had been 
told to expect but a white-haired, jowly salesman who is patient, intellectual, 
witty, self-effacing and even a little bit shy. Sure, his products are a bit 
wacky, many of them say, but his ideas aren't life threatening. And some are 
beginning to think that, on a personal level at least, Joe is not such a bad 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
His party appears to have significant support among blacks, especially the 
powerful trade unions, and Communist leaders wield considerable influence in 
the ANC, where they make up a third of the national executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
But with the fall of Communist governments in Eastern Europe, the dismal 
failure of Marxist economies in Africa and the vilification of Stalin in the 
Soviet Union, Slovo starts out at a disadvantage when talking economics with 
the staunchly pro-capitalist white business leaders who control South Africa's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of Business Day newspaper, Ken Owen, welcomed the Communist Party 
home by saying that Slovo had launched "The World's Last Communist Party on the 
path of the dinosaur." 
</P>
<P>
Others were less kind. The ruling National Party's spokesman, Renier Schoeman, 
says Slovo's party is "nothing more than an unmourned relic of the past, which 
has no place, role or influence in the new South Africa of the future." 
</P>
<P>
As Slovo conceded recently: "To be a Communist in this country takes more than 
a sense of humor. It takes a sense of survival." 
</P>
<P>
But humor helps. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo and communism were grilled in typical fashion for two hours one day last 
week by patrons at O'Hagan's wine bar, a restaurant in a white Johannesburg 
suburb. Halfway through the question-and-answer session, one diner asked Slovo 
how he could ever hope to turn white opinion to his cause. 
</P>
<P>
"You turn it around by shattering the myth that is being spread that we favor a 
post-apartheid economy which is going to result in the nationalization of 
O'Hagan's wine bar," Slovo said, generating laughs in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, after eating the kingclip (fish) here, I can assure you I'll leave it to 
O'Hagan," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Slovo's own political philosophy has undergone significant changes 
recently. Once a strong advocate of the ANC's guerrilla war and the author of a 
book entitled "No Middle Road," he has embraced Nelson Mandela's moves toward a 
negotiated solution to South Africa's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Once regarded as a hard-line Stalinist, he has begun to rethink his party's 
dogma. He still believes communism is the ultimate answer for South Africa, but 
he now says "there is a place for private domestic and foreign capital" in his 
vision of a socialist state, and he speaks of multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo now concedes that capitalism is superior to socialism as a means of 
generating wealth, but he says it fails when it comes to distributing that 
wealth. Any new government in South Africa, a country where the overwhelming 
majority of productive land and businesses is controlled by whites, will have 
to find a way to redistribute wealth equitably, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in Eastern Europe, he said, was that the governments had practiced 
a distorted form of socialism, which they imposed by force. Like Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Slovo now believes socialism can only work if 
it is twinned with democracy and free trade unions. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't point to any country as a fine ideal of the kind of socialist society 
that should be built," Slovo says. "But I still believe it can work. If a tool 
is used badly, it is the fault of the workman, and not the tool." 
</P>
<P>
Slovo first embraced communism early in life. His family emigrated from 
Lithuania in 1936 when Slovo was 9, joining the thousands moving to 
Johannesburg in search of work in the gold mines. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in a religious Jewish household and although now an atheist, he 
remembers learning the ethics of Jewish culture as a young boy. To this day, he 
says, "I think I represent the positive aspects of Jewish culture." 
</P>
<P>
He joined the youth league of the Communist Party in 1942 at the age of 16, and 
two years later, at the height of World War II, served with the South African 
army in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party in South Africa had been launched in 1921, and its earliest 
crusades were on behalf of white workers whose jobs were threatened by cheap 
black labor. But before Slovo joined it, the party had already begun to violate 
the unwritten rules of white politics by accepting black members, thus 
beginning a long association with the black liberation struggle that now gives 
the party its strongest base of support. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo earned a law degree at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University and began 
to make a name for himself by defending anti-apartheid activists in some of the 
same South African courtrooms where another lawyer, Nelson Mandela, was 
working. 
</P>
<P>
He married Ruth First, the daughter of the party's treasurer and the author of 
some of the first journalistic exposes of apartheid. The couple were among the 
first 600 people named in 1950 under the Suppression of Communism Act, which 
outlawed the party and curtailed the political activities of suspected 
Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo helped plan the 1955 Congress of the People, which wrote the ANC's 
manifesto known as the Freedom Charter, but, because of official restrictions, 
had to watch the proceedings through binoculars from a nearby rooftop. At one 
point he was charged with treason, though the accusation was later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, he joined Mandela and other key ANC leaders in secretly forming 
Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the ANC's military wing, and launching 
a campaign of sabotage against Pretoria that would escalate over the years into 
a bloody guerrilla war, with bombs exploding everywhere from government offices 
to shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo left the country in 1963 to get arms and financial help from foreign 
governments. While he was away, his colleagues in the military high command 
were arrested, convicted and sentenced to life prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo remained abroad to re-establish the ANC's army, becoming its chief of 
staff, and he became the first white member of the organization's executive 
committee. Those were especially dangerous times. During the 1980s, with the 
guerrilla war gaining support among blacks inside South Africa, Slovo moved 
from country to country, house to house, rarely spending two nights under the 
same roof for fear of being tracked down by South African agents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, South African commandos attacked Slovo's operational headquarters on 
the outskirts of Maputo, the capital of South Africa's neighbor, Mozambique. He 
escaped, but 13 of his colleagues were killed. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Slovo's wife, Ruth, was killed by a parcel bomb sent to her 
office in Maputo. South African agents were suspected. 
</P>
<P>
The government blamed Slovo for directing an ANC troop buildup and escalating 
the military campaign in 1984, triggering widespread unrest and police 
confrontations that claimed more than 2,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
A government publication at the time called Slovo "an evil genius (and) 
dedicated Communist . . . without morality of any kind, for whom only victory 
counts, whatever the human cost." 
</P>
<P>
But in South Africa's black townships, Slovo's name had become a rallying cry 
along with the name of Mandela, and the Communist Party-ANC partnership was 
hailed with shouts of "Long Live the Alliance!" 
</P>
<P>
Those embattled days seemed far away last week when Mandela, Slovo and three of 
their colleagues met with the South African government and then announced they 
were suspending the armed liberation struggle. 
</P>
<P>
But Slovo still defends his role in that armed effort and vows that the 
military struggle will be resumed if negotiations fail. 
</P>
<P>
A right-wing heckler at O'Hagan's last week demanded to know "how it feels to 
kill innocent women and children." As other patrons booed the questioner and 
the worried emcee tried to move to another question, Slovo insisted on 
answering. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel any joy out of death or suffering or pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I say, my friend, if you were living in a country where you with your 
white skin were denied a vote, if your wives and children were being shot down 
merely because they went in for political protest, you would not have my 
respect if you were not prepared to pick up a gun to rectify that situation."

DITKA NOT AT LOSS AFTER 6-10; 
</P>
<P>
CHICAGO BEAR COACH TURNS 50, WON'T TURN OVER A NEW LEAF

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back east, they remember Mike Ditka as a compulsive, all-out football player 
who, at the University of Pittsburgh, sought to refine his blocking skills with 
hits on a padded steel blocking sled. 
</P>
<P>
As an ambitious freshman, Ditka charged the sled ferociously, and knocked 
himself out. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
So they restricted him to practicing against teammates -- but that didn't work. 
He knocked out two or three of them. 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, his coach, Ernie Hefferle, confined Ditka to the bench until 
game day. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about it later, Hefferle said: "When Mike walked on the field, . . . 
everybody was his enemy." 
</P>
<P>
That still appears to be true. As Ditka enters his ninth year as coach of the 
Chicago Bears, he can look back on more disagreements with players, officials, 
owners, fans, coaches and blocking sleds than perhaps anyone else in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
But he hasn't seen anything yet. This, in Chicago, is a different kind of year. 
For the first time since turning the Bears around in the early 1980s, Ditka is 
coming off a losing season. 
</P>
<P>
His 1989 club finished 6-10, descending from a league-best of 52-11 (.825) 
during 1985-88. And if the depression continues, anything could happen -- to 
the emotionally driven leader or his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the 1990 question is whether Ditka makes friends or foes of his 
numerous new players, who are among the youngest in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Although the kids let him down last year, he seems sold on them as athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm picking us to win the division because I think we have the talent," Ditka 
said the other day. "But kids are so different now. They're paid so . . . much. 
They've had so much -- they've had everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I tried hard to reach them -- I tried to hit a chord. I've never 
tried harder in my life, but they didn't hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Will they hear him this year? 
</P>
<P>
Critics doubt it. In 1990 predictions, many are placing Chicago behind one or 
more of the three NFC Central rivals the Bears used to consistently dominate: 
Minnesota, Detroit and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
One reporter identified the Bears as a fourth-place team and then, expressing a 
prevalent thought, asked: "Can the (Chicago) players get along with Mike Ditka? 
There's a groundswell of dislike for (Ditka) in the locker room right now." 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, the Bears' locker room could be the only such place in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Ditka remains the toast of the city -- one of Chicago's most popular 
sports figures and one of its best-known celebrities in any field. 
</P>
<P>
Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet, mentioning Ditka's restaurant and the many 
television commercials starring the Bear coach, said: "Mike is Mr. Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
The coach's midtown restaurant, one of the nation's few successful sports 
restaurants, was the first in Illinois to make the national top 25 in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Author Pete Gent, after dinner there one night, observed: "(Ditka) is the 
perfect celebrity for Chicago, and Chicago is his kind of town. He combines, 
with an exceptional flair and ease, the panache of the Lake Forest swells and 
the pulsing drive of the (working class)." 
</P>
<P>
But . . . disliked in his own locker room? 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty strong. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, perhaps nobody in the NFL this season faces a challenge like 
Ditka's: At 50, is he too set in his irascible ways to win the respect of 
new-generation players, and, in so doing, hold the respect of the city he 
loves? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HE'S BEEN THERE 
</P>
<P>
That Ditka could be on the outs with football players remains inconceivable to 
many fans. For he's a man who has been there. In his playing days, he was an 
NFL star, a flinty tight end who played his way into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrated for selfless blocking, for toughness, for continuously hard-edged 
performances, Ditka was simultaneously a great, soft-handed receiver. 
</P>
<P>
As a Bear rookie in 1961, he caught 56 passes, then improved every year through 
1964, when he caught 75. That set an NFL tight-end record that lasted into the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka could play. 
</P>
<P>
He could also infuriate those he played with. At Pitt, they talk about the day 
that a teammate, Chuck Reinhold, missed a tackle on Herb Adderley as Michigan 
State scored to take a one-touchdown lead. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the locker room, Reinhold said: "We're only down 7-0. It's only 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, boiling, said: "That's bull. You had a chance to make the play, and you 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, Reinhold said later, Ditka bounced him off a locker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably wrong," Ditka admitted after he thought it over. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't apologize to Reinhold for a week. 
</P>
<P>
After Ditka moved his act to the NFL, fans were no safer than teammates or 
opponents. In a game against the Rams in Los Angeles one Saturday night in 
1966, Ditka, as the Bears' tight end, was enraged when a misguided fan jumped 
onto the Coliseum field and ran around crazily, as if, perhaps, he was 
motivated by one too many beers. 
</P>
<P>
The officials called time and then called for the police, but Ditka prefers 
direct action. Stepping suddenly out of the Bears' huddle, he floored the 
intruder with a punch to the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had been laughing. Now it booed Ditka -- not that it bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a fan has any right on a football field," he said then, and 
still contends, still thoroughly satisfied with his role as policeman, judge 
and jury. 
</P>
<P>
As a coach, Ditka throws tantrums or clipboards more often than punches, most 
notably on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
One time after his team punted to Detroit, Ditka, in a typical act of 
exasperation, ran up to Bear tight end Tim Wrightman and screamed: "You took a 
wrong split." 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, Wrightman, one of his brightest players, replied: "I have no idea what 
you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, as Ditka ranted on, Wrightman walked away. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, it turned out that Wrightman was right and Ditka wrong. After 
inspecting the films, Ditka apologized. 
</P>
<P>
As he often is, he was full of remorse -- the morning after. 
</P>
<P>
That's Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
In any competitive situation, Chicago Tribune writer Don Pierson said, "Mike 
fights fire with gasoline, and says he's sorry later." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TOP SERGEANT 
</P>
<P>
Extreme competitiveness makes Ditka what he is, and after years of battling and 
berating and erupting, he looks the part. 
</P>
<P>
In a war movie, he would be the tough old top sergeant that even colonels defer 
to. 
</P>
<P>
With a face like a clenched fist, Ditka is one the most recognizable coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the NFL's most domineering coach since Vince Lombardi, he comes 
across as the authority figure some football fans want. That accounts for much 
of his national popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other old player, Ditka limps from a collection of old injuries but 
ignores the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Even a 1988 heart attack failed to change him. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, on his first day back, Ditka promised: "You will never hear me 
yelling or screaming again." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after another tirade, he said: "I lie a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ditka is more candid than most. He is also sharper and more 
considerate than many, taking a personal interest, for one thing, in the Bears' 
organization employees. 
</P>
<P>
Walking down the hall one morning early in his coaching career, he turned a 
corner and bumped into one of the dozens of employees, a club secretary, 
Barbara Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Coach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Barb," Ditka said. "How's things in Kenosha?" 
</P>
<P>
Later, she told a friend: "Amazingly, he already knows us all. He even knows 
I'm from Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
After years of observation, Allen defines Ditka in terms of two traits. 
</P>
<P>
"He believes in himself," she said. "And he believes that everyone else should 
believe in him, too." 
</P>
<P>
If the younger Chicago players can't quite go along with that, the explanation, 
possibly, is that they don't relate to Ditka the player. They're too young to 
have seen him illustrate, personally, the all-out, reckless-abandon style he 
recommends. 
</P>
<P>
Anther explanation is that he apparently wields player pain and discomfort 
deliberately, as a motivational weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Ditka keeps the (Bear team) on edge," Sun-Times football columnist Kevin Lamb 
said. "He makes the players turn to each other for emotional support, just as 
they must do to win on the field." 
</P>
<P>
If they don't like it, they aren't supposed to like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TROUBLE-SHOOTER 
</P>
<P>
Almost perversely, Chicago's losing season a year ago has heightened the public 
interest in Ditka. As a winner, he was a big man in the Midwest, particularly 
after his 1985 team won the Super Bowl. As a loser, he seems to attract even 
more attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know what he's going to do next," Bear spokesman Bryan 
Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
If his first 50 years provide a guide, Ditka isn't about to recede into the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
As early as his Little League days -- the year he turned 11 -- adversity only 
spurred him to more action. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for instance, the time that the Ditka brothers' battery was losing 
its grip on a Little League game. On the mound, Mike's brother, Ashton, the 
team's ace pitcher, walked a couple of batters as catcher Mike stewed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mike called time, put Ashton behind the plate, and took the mound 
himself, pitching out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
An inning later when the team's shortstop made an error, Mike called time 
again, and switched positions with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have many friends in Little League," he said, recalling his behavior 
in those formative years. "But I loved the (competition)." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Carnegie, Pa., Ditka grew up in nearby Aliquippa with a younger 
sister and two younger brothers in the family of a steel-mill welder for the 
railroad. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandparents came over from the Ukraine, and my grandfather went into the 
mill," he said. "So did my dad. 
</P>
<P>
"And the mill was waiting for me, too -- although I'd never be there now. By 
now, I'd be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys I played sports with as a kid have been laid off." 
</P>
<P>
He said his earliest memory was the sight of his father coming home from the 
mill. There were burns on the senior Ditka's arms, and burn holes in all his 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
When in later years there were more rather than fewer burns, Mike was driven to 
consider a different vocation. 
</P>
<P>
"I got interested in dentistry, and went to school to be a dentist," he said. 
"However, the opportunity to play pro ball came up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RICH MAN 
</P>
<P>
Today, he lives the life of a rich man in a big new house in suburban 
Bannockburn, 15 minutes west of the Bears' practice field in upscale Lake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is the former Diana Tratham, and their friends say that she is as 
outgoing in social settings and as straightforward as Mike is. They were 
married 14 years ago. There are four grown children from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
On a clear day, after getting up at 5:15 for a vigorous exercise program, Ditka 
heads for the office in a 1936 Auburn roadster, or perhaps a 1948 Packard 
convertible. He collects old cars. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a taste for spirits. Once during the Bears' Super Bowl season -- 
after celebrating, on an airplane, a victory over San Francisco -- he was 
arrested on the way home for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
They calculate in Chicago that Ditka's income is about $3 million annually -- 
counting revenue from television commercials, speeches, restaurants and the 
Bears, who pay him $700,000 on a contract that ends after this season. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the '80s, club president Michael B. McCaskey waited until near the end 
of Ditka's final contract year before making it definite that the coach would 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our coach, and we want him," the employer said again this week. 
</P>
<P>
Said the employee: "I'll coach some more, but not forever. It's a young man's 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka knows he can always make a living on the lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm night last month, he delivered his last speech of 1990 -- except for 
the quiet little talks he is reserving for his football team -- at a small city 
in Indiana, where they said with their applause that he earned his $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
His message was carefully aimed at those who wished to sell more insurance or 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka ended the speech, as he almost always does, with a few words from a 
former citizen of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, who never suspected that he would 
someday be stirring an NFL coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the best I could, and I did the best I know how," said the 10th coach of 
the Bears, quoting the 16th president of the United States. "And I'll keep 
right on doing it up to the end. If the end brings me out all right, then what 
is said against me will not matter. If the end brings me out all wrong, then 10 
angels swearing I was right will make no difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PARADOXES 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka's future is what concerns him. If there is a 6-10 season in his 
past, there is also a Super Bowl, but that's all water over the dam. 
</P>
<P>
What can he do for Chicago this season? 
</P>
<P>
If no one can say, one reason is that Ditka's career is a study in 
contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, he was brought into coaching by one of the NFL's most successful 
leaders of the last 30 years, Tom Landry. The Dallas Cowboys were a winner in 
their Ditka days, and Landry, apparently, saw the makings of a coach in the 
tight end he imported from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Landry's view, Ditka was not endorsed by the rest of the Dallas staff. 
</P>
<P>
In a staff poll one night at the Cowboys' Thousand Oaks camp, when there were 
nine or 10 names on the ballot, Ditka was voted the least likely Landry 
assistant to succeed as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few he impressed favorably was Dan Reeves, now of the Denver 
Broncos, who admires Ditka's intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves recalls playing cards with Ditka and several others one time at Thousand 
Oaks when Ditka, between deals, got so mad at himself or the cards or somebody 
that he stood up and threw his chair across the room. 
</P>
<P>
"All four legs stuck in the wall," Reeves said, marveling at Ditka's power. "I 
told myself, 'Man, this guy hates to lose.' " 
</P>
<P>
At about the time that Dallas assistants were voting against Ditka, the late 
George Halas was voting for him. 
</P>
<P>
That was at the outset of the '80s, when Halas was going over all the people he 
knew and had worked with and against -- in a career that spanned 60 NFL years. 
Of all these, he selected his old tight end to run the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Ditka, the prince of contradictions, is a link through Halas to the 
league's beginnings -- almost the only remaining link. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka is at his most paradoxical in player relations. His sideline outbursts -- 
and, perhaps more damaging, his falling-out with his younger players late last 
season -- are the stuff of legends. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago writer Lamb, who keeps track of the coach's outbursts, calls him Mt. 
Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Ditka has been one of the most successful motivators of his era. When Bill 
Walsh was winning in San Francisco with a superior understanding of modern 
football, Ditka was winning with a superior knowledge of how to make athletes 
play to their potential. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only NFL coach who has his players ready for every game," said 
Chicago reporter Pierson, president of the Pro Football Writers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, Pierson predicted, the Bear coach will have a four-word epitaph that 
sums it all up: "His teams played hard." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that Ditka would break an arm, if necessary, to inspire his 
players. Indeed, he once did. Lecturing the Bears on a performance that 
displeased him, he banged a table so hard that he broke a bone in his fist. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, with his right arm in a cast, he stood up at a team meeting and 
implored: "Win this one for Lefty." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka also concedes that in the NFL, playing smart football helps. Talking the 
other day about his 1990 plans, he said the Bears will use some no-huddle plays 
on offense, and adjust from run-oriented to pass-oriented defense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when asked to put his football philosophy into a sentence, he said: "Hit 
'em again harder." 
</P>
<P>
He confessed that he's sorry if his temper tantrums have offended the Bears, or 
anyone else, in his nine years as Chicago's coach. 
</P>
<P>
How sorry? 
</P>
<P>
"Along with Frank Sinatra, I have some regrets about a few things," Ditka said. 
"But they're too few to remember."

<P>
Hedley Donovan, Henry Luce's hand-chosen successor as editor-in-chief of the 
Time Inc. publishing empire, died Monday in New York Hospital after what a 
company spokesman described only as a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan, dubbed "Pope Moses II" by Time staffers after succeeding Luce, was 76, 
and had lived in Manhattan and Sands Point, Long Island. More recently, he had 
served from 1979-80 as personal adviser to President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
As the company's top editor from 1964 to 1979, Donovan continued the evolution 
of Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Time magazines while presiding over the 
demise of Life magazine as a weekly publication. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Time Inc. also introduced two magazines, People and Money. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan commanded an editorial staff of 1,400 people. In his 1989 
autobiography, "Right Places, Right Times: 40 Years In Journalism, Not Counting 
My Paper Route," Donovan wrote: "I managed them -- to the extent . . . that 
such people can be managed at all -- by appointing their bosses, and managing 
them. To the extent they can be managed." 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "political independent with conservative leanings," Donovan 
oversaw an editorial policy shift in Time Inc.'s magazines from the orthodox 
Republican views of Luce to a more independent stance. 
</P>
<P>
Initially a staunch advocate of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam policy, 
Donovan eventually came to agree with his correspondents and senior editors who 
had grown increasingly pessimistic that the war could be won. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime supporter of Richard M. Nixon, Time -- in a post-Watergate editorial 
in 1973 -- demanded the President's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan graduated magna cum laude from the University of Minnesota in 1934 and 
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He won a Rhodes scholarship and took a second 
bachelor's degree in history at Oxford's Hertford College in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan began his career in 1937, as a reporter for the Washington Post, and 
covered the State Department, Capitol Hill and the White House. Entering the 
Navy in 1942, he served as an intelligence officer and rose to the rank of 
lieutenant commander. 
</P>
<P>
When the war ended, Donovan joined Fortune as a writer, rose to managing editor 
in 1953, and then was handpicked by Luce to become editorial director of Time 
Inc., now Time Warner Inc., and Luce's heir apparent.
