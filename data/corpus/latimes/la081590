PROBE FAULTS ASBESTOS CLEANUP OF S.D. SHIP

A San Diego-based ship repair company faces federal charges after employees 
complained to naval investigators that they and hundreds of sailors had been 
exposed to asbestos when workers removed the cancer-causing substance from the 
aircraft carrier Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
After an eight-month investigation by the Naval Investigative Service, charges 
were filed Monday against California Marine Commercial Insulation Inc. and 
company president Frank Chavez, alleging that the company knowingly failed to 
ensure that workers took proper precautions as they removed more than 260 feet 
of pipes covered with dry, crumbling asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"For Frank Chavez and CMCI, this was a crime of greed," said Clifford D. Link, 
an NIS assistant special agent in charge of the regional fraud unit. "They were 
in it to make a buck and it was not a consideration if they exposed people to 
unhealthy levels of asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
CMCI workers, often with no protective clothing or respirators, ripped out 
friable asbestos in bathrooms, berthing areas, stairways, and the brig of the 
ship while sailors used those areas, employees told NIS investigators. Workers 
toted dust-laden pipes through bunk and kitchen areas. They also piled up the 
insulating material on pallets in the hangar deck, leaving it loose until the 
pallet filled, then dumping it into a pier-side dumpster -- all violations of 
procedures since the actions could have allowed the release of fibers into the 
air, the employees said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was issued an arbitrary death sentence in the name of someone else's 
pocketbook," Mike Calahan, one former pipe fitter, told The Times. "It was 'do 
the job or we get someone else to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
As he worked in the berthing area for sailors in the engineering department, 
Calahan said there were no signs posted -- as required by law -- indicating 
that asbestos was being removed. Calahan said he told some sailors that the 
material on the pipes was probably asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees complained to the NIS, prompting the investigation, which culminated 
in criminal charges filed this week by the U.S. Attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But Chavez denied any wrongdoing and said that all the work conducted aboard 
the aircraft carrier followed regulations. And workers, he said, were given 
protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say that as far as any removals were done, they were done 
according to rules and regulations," said Chavez, who is also the owner of 
CMCI. "All the work I did here was properly done. I don't want to answer any 
more questions." 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, banned in 1979 for most construction uses, can cause lung cancer and 
asbestosis, a fatal lung ailment. Asbestos, experts say, is dangerous if it is 
inhaled into the lungs, though onset of disease may take anywhere from 10 to 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the Ranger, asbestos dust from all the renovation work was widespread, 
some employees complained to the NIS. The carrier, which would carry about 
5,000 sailors while at sea, would have had about 2,800 aboard while docked. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about dust laying throughout sections of the ship -- the brig, 
berthing areas, third deck, second deck. It was everywhere, hideously," said a 
former CMCI worker who requested anonymity. "Every sailor, every civilian who 
walked through would have been exposed to asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
CMCI and Chavez were hired by Pacific Ship Repair &amp; Fabrication to remove 
and replace 1,100 feet of asbestos-covered pipes aboard the Ranger. Chavez is 
the father-in-law of Pacific Ship's owner David Bain and he is also an employee 
of Pacific Ship. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Ship and David Bain, a former campaign treasurer to Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, have been under investigation by NIS, the federal grand jury and the 
FBI for allegedly submitting fraudulent billings to the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing more than a dozen current and former CMCI workers, NIS 
officials were able to piece together how CMCI employees were removing the 
insulating material that contained between 30 to 50 percent amoscite asbestos, 
according to tests. Work on the ship took place intermittently last winter when 
the Ranger docked at North Island Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent asbestos fibers from being released into the air, officials require 
a slew of measures to contain the hazardous fibers and protect workers. 
Asbestos must be wetted when exposed and sealed in containers bearing warnings. 
When bagged, it should be doubled-bagged. The material must be taken to a 
specially designated landfill. Companies are also required to provide the EPA 
with a written notice describing the asbestos removal. Aboard the Ranger, 
however, these procedures were allegedly flouted. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, CMCI and Chavez "did knowingly renovate the USS 
Ranger in violation of the asbestos work practice standards and thereby caused 
asbestos to be emitted in violation of asbestos standards." 
</P>
<P>
Alerted to the investigations launched by NIS and the U.S. Attorney's office, 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent inspectors aboard the 
Ranger last March, after the asbestos abatement was completed, and cited 
Pacific Ship for three serious violations, which each carry a $1,000 fine. 
These violations did not relate to asbestos removal work but other workplace 
hazards. Pacific Ship, however, is contesting the violations. 
</P>
<P>
"All violations that were classified as serious by OSHA means either death or 
physical injury could result from the cited item," said Jack Rhodes, an OSHA 
area director. 
</P>
<P>
And because of recent inquiries by The Times, OSHA inspectors returned to the 
carrier this week, to continue inspections, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has a monitoring arm -- the Supervisor of Ships Building, Conversion 
and Repair -- that is responsible for preparing contracts and overseeing work 
conducted on vessels. The supervisor sends inspectors out to ships to ensure 
that all work is done correctly. In the Ranger's case, however, officials said 
they were unaware of any mishap. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea about there being any problem anywhere," said Capt. Vern 
Edwards, supervisor of the overseeing arm -- who added that he knew of the 
investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney and NIS. "I guess my 
responsibility as a supervisor is to ensure to the best of our ability that 
what we asked for in the contract is being executed in accordance with the 
contract. As far as any irregularities or the possibility of irregularities, I 
can tell you the U.S. Attorney is investigating." 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks and months ahead, what Edwards and his inspectors knew and what 
they should have known could become important issues, especially if the Navy 
and CMCI employees choose to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
CMCI, charged with violating the Clean Air Act and Asbestos Work Practice 
standards, could be fined $25,000, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Melanie K. 
Pierson. Chavez, who is being charged as an accessory, could face a $12,500 
fine and six months in jail, she said. The case will be one of the first to 
utilize the federal sentencing guidelines, she said. Pierson declined to 
elaborate on the case, saying a press conference was scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said they would be working closely with the U.S. Attorney's 
office, as well as the Navy's own legal system, the Judge Advocate General. 
Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard said he was not yet certain what course 
the Navy would take. 
</P>
<P>
"The health and welfare of our people is of primary importance," Pritchard 
said. "But I don't want to start a panic. This could have affected no one other 
than the workers involved."

KILLEA'S DIAPER LABELING BILL FAILS TO ATTRACT NEEDED VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A proposal by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) to require environmental warning 
labels on packages of disposable diapers died -- again -- when it failed to 
garner enough votes Tuesday in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. However, 
it could be brought up for reconsideration today. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted 8-7 to scuttle Killea's measure requiring a label on 
disposable diaper packages warning that "single-use disposable diapers create 
significant environmental problems and costs to the community when disposed." 
The bill would have required manufacturers to label diaper packages by Jan. 1, 
1992, or face a $50 fine per package. 
</P>
<P>
Killea's measure has received strong opposition from Proctor &amp; Gamble, the 
makers of Pampers disposables, and Kimberly-Clark, makers of Huggies, who claim 
the bill unfairly singles out disposable diapers as an environmental hazard. 
The companies have argued that the alternative being touted by Killea -- 
old-fashioned cloth diapers -- is even more environmentally offensive because 
they dirty six times more water during cleaning than disposable diapers, which 
are designed to be rinsed once before being thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole objective is to put a user of the product on a guilt trip," Gene 
Hill, Kimberly-Clark's regional director of state government relations, said 
about Killea's measure. 
</P>
<P>
Killea, however, says the water claims are exaggerated, and underscored to 
legislative colleagues Tuesday that her measure is not a tax or a ban. She said 
it is a way to educate consumers about the environmental consequences of 
disposable diapers, which account for 2% of the solid wastes generated each 
year by Californians. She says the 2.5 million single-use diapers thrown away 
annually by Californians would be enough to pave Interstate 5 from the Mexican 
border to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting claims prompted Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) to 
observe that the disposable diaper debate represented "two environmental 
problems coming to a loggerhead -- the disposal issue versus water use." 
O'Connell, considered sympathetic to recycling issues, represents 
drought-stricken Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the measure was Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who 
claimed the Killea bill would also have required labels on incontinent supplies 
for the elderly. Diapers for the elderly are exactly the same product, only 
bigger, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The label proposal was killed in the Senate. But it was restored last month by 
another Assembly committee before being sent along in the legislative process. 
California is one of 25 states considering measures to label or ban disposable 
diapers.

U.S. ROLE IN BUILDING IRAQI WAR MACHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Robin Wright's excellent piece on "How U.S. Helped Build Iraqi War 
Machine" (Aug. 7), the current crisis in the Middle East is the direct result 
of U.S. interventionism. Four years ago America advisers taught the Iraqis how 
to win a blitzkrieg-style war against Iran and now Saddam Hussein is using our 
expertise and weapons purchased from the West to threaten the rest of the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Can we blame the Iraqis without also blaming ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
How long will it before the United States government realizes that the billions 
of dollars it spend on arms exports both weaken our economy (by diverting U.S. 
industry to non-productive uses) and destabilize the rest of the world (by 
strengthening military dictators like Noriega and Hussein). 
</P>
<P>
The answer in the Middle East (and in the rest of the world) is not to pour 
fuel on the flames of religious and nationalist hatreds by importing arms and 
encouraging militarism, but to withdraw military aid and focus on nonviolent, 
political solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Flexing our military might may provide apparent short-term solutions but 
doesn't address the underlying problems or create the conditions necessary for 
a stable and durable peace. Let's use economic sanctions and the peacekeeping 
forces of the United Nations to help resolve the conflicts in the Middle East. 
We cannot afford to keep fanning the flames of war in this highly volatile 
region.

You have made an error. You said the murder rate has risen by several percent 
(Part B, Aug.2). 
</P>
<P>
This cannot be true. We voted California Chief Justice Rose Bird and the 
liberals out. We have the death penalty now. Therefore, there must actually be 
a decrease in the murder rate.

Your editorial ("The Oil Shortage That Need Not Be," Aug. 9) makes excellent 
sense in its separation of source and supply. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is time for "the United States to get serious about renewed energy 
conservation and finding alternative sources to oil." 
</P>
<P>
What about solar energy and other ways to make machinery run (non-nuclear, that 
is)? Consider what might have been accomplished with the time, energy, brains, 
and money spent on research for atom and hydrogen bombs, "Star Wars," and all 
of the other huge and polluting weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the process could be speeded, if only certain favored interests and 
states could be granted sole distribution and guaranteed profits from the sun's 
rays.

A telling item in the Aug. 8 Times: The U.S. may agree to sell Saudi Arabia 40 
F-15 fighters in a deal heretofore blocked through the efforts of lobbyists of 
the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee. Isn't it interesting how our 
policy toward a country suddenly changes when we need it? 
</P>
<P>
As America hurriedly seeks to forge a world consensus on Iraq's aggression in 
the Middle East, it wonders why Jordan is reluctant to join in the chorus of 
condemnation, and why Saudi Arabia is reluctant to accept our forces. Of 
course, now that our oil interests in the region are threatened, we need those 
countries. But what have they or any of the other moderate Arab countries 
gotten from us in 45 years of hurry-up-and-wait Middle Eastern policy? Nothing. 
History doesn't begin with yesterday.

THE PASSION FOR MUSIC BRINGS DOWN ANOTHER WALL; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURAL EXCHANGE: THE AMERICAN SOVIET YOUTH ORCHESTRA SURMOUNTS MORE THAN THE 
USUAL ODDS TO GIVE A HARMONIOUS PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. FREDERICK STARR, S. Frederick Starr is president of Oberlin College in 
Ohio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight and Sunday night one of the most unusual and best orchestras to be 
heard anywhere will fill the Hollywood Bowl with sound. It is an orchestra of 
soloists, an all-star team. Unlike most all-star sports teams, however, this 
one is international in its composition. Moreover, the nations from which it 
draws -- the United States and the Soviet Union -- literally do not speak the 
same language and, until recently, viewed each other as bitter rivals on the 
world stage. 
</P>
<P>
How can such an orchestra succeed? Mainly because its musicians passionately 
want it to. These 100 young Americans and Russians, ranging in ages from 17 to 
23, know they were selected as the very best instrumentalists from their 
nations' combined population of more than half a billion. Organized by Oberlin 
College in Ohio and the Moscow Conservatory, the American Soviet Youth 
Orchestra exists to prove that Russians and Americans can cooperate in one of 
the most complex human organizations of all: a symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
So far they've succeeded brilliantly. Last month they brought down the house in 
Moscow, opened the closed Baltic city of Kaliningrad (formerly Konigsberg) 
after 45 years of isolation, and brought crowds to their feet in Weimar, Milan, 
Hamburg and Amsterdam. With tonight's concert they start an American tour that 
culminates in performances at Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the west 
lawn of the U.S. Capitol. A special act of Congress was necessary to enable the 
orchestra to appear at that restricted locale. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of perestroika, is it really still so important to prove that 
Russians and Americans can cooperate productively? Definitely. American 
businesses have signed well over 1,000 joint-venture agreements with the 
Soviets, yet fewer than 100 of these have moved from paper to reality. The 
experience of the American-Soviet orchestra suggests why most are stymied. 
Simple telephone, fax and mail communications between here and Moscow often 
pose daunting challenges. Organizational and management styles in the two 
countries differ tremendously. While financing on the Soviet side is still 
totally from the state, the American costs are borne privately by 
public-spirited corporations, foundations and individuals. This, too, renders 
the task of meshing the two systems more difficult. And of course, Russian and 
English are different languages. 
</P>
<P>
A symphony orchestra, however, presents special complexities of its own. 
American French horn player Nathan Pawelek and his Russian counterpart, 
Aleksandr Semyonov, have been taught different styles. Russian oboists even cut 
their reeds differently from American oboists to produce a distinctive national 
sound. And while American bassists are taught to observe strict precision, 
Russians tend more to emphasize the grand sweep and emotional impact of their 
playing. Neither approach is incorrect, but that is not the point. Which is 
best for the orchestra, and how is the overall sound to be shaped? 
</P>
<P>
The task of mixing these sounds into a single orchestra falls to a 
Soviet-American team of conductors led by Pavel Kogan of the Soviet State 
Orchestra and Leonard Slatkin of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, tonight's 
conductor. Their talented associates, Catherine Comet of the American Symphony 
Orchestra and Leonid Nikolayev of the Moscow Conservatory, are among the 
fastest-rising stars in the international musical firmament. Working through 
interpreters in what must set an international record for intensive rehearsals, 
these four conductors have forged 100 soloists into a single artistic organism. 
</P>
<P>
For all its special challenges, this musical joint venture has proven a 
resounding success. Zubin Mehta, after conducting the orchestra at the Kennedy 
Center in 1988, stated that "while it exists, this is one of the world's finest 
orchestras." 
</P>
<P>
Tchaikovsky once said that every great orchestra is a republic of its own. The 
"republic" that will step out on the stage at the Hollywood Bowl tonight is 
neither Russian nor American but something better than either country could 
produce alone. It combines the Russians' special strengths in the strings with 
the Americans' virtuosity in winds and brass. 
</P>
<P>
And this, too, is part of the message. Cooperating across 7,000 miles, two 
languages and two cultures is far more demanding than working with people in 
one's own city or region. But it is possible, and the results can even be 
dazzling. The American Soviet Youth Orchestra proves it.

By THURMON GREEN, a Southern California Rapid Transit District bus driver for 
18 years, is now a rail operator for the Blue Line. He gave his appraisal of 
life on the new transit systemso far: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've been 18 years with the district, and I've never had a boring moment. There 
have been times when I wish there had been. 
</P>
<P>
On certain (bus) lines, it's a little too alive, if you know what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
On the Blue Line, it's a little too active at the grade crossings. You fear 
making contact with another human being coming through there. You're moving 
through there at 55 (m.p.h.) or 45 -- most times 55 -- points where other 
vehicles are crossing. That's a little hectic, mentally, but you learn to cope 
with it, try to take every precaution. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is ironing out pretty good, though. I think the Blue Line will be 
something that will be around for a while. Everything is falling into place. 
We're getting the bugs out of the system. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't look forward to driving a bus (again). Some of the guys look like 
they've died and gone to heaven! That's the way we relate to it. It's a 
different atmosphere. We look back over the crowd, and we have a nice class of 
people -- nice clientele of people -- going to work. They're reading the 
papers, and we try to give them as smooth a ride as possible. We have a system 
called ATP -- automatic train protection system. And if a train up ahead breaks 
down or whatever, and we don't know it, this is something that will shut us 
down right away. 
</P>
<P>
I went through extensive training (for this job)) and I didn't know it was 
going to be that extensive. I went home on many days and told the wife I might 
just go back to the buses. I didn't have this many exams when I was in college! 
I'm glad I did now. I'm glad I stuck with it.

The problem now is the notorious difficulty of sitting on bayonets. President 
Bush says that the objective of the United States in the gulf is "restoration 
of Kuwait's legitimate government." That also is what the United Nations 
Security Council demands. 
</P>
<P>
The President says that U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia are not there "to drive the 
Iraqis out of Kuwait." Why, then, should the Iraqis leave? 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council intends them to be forced out by economic and political 
pressures. Hence the U.N.-mandated embargo on commerce with Iraq.

However, the list of successful embargoes is short. This one has near-universal 
support from the United Nations' member governments, but it is opposed by 
millions of individuals in the Middle East who believe that Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein is the man to lead them out of poverty and end the humiliations Arabs 
have experienced throughout modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has land borders with Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Turkey 
and Saudi Arabia are committed to the embargo, the latter with little 
enthusiasm but no choice, as the victim of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is trapped, and King Hussein would surely be grateful if Saudi Arabia 
and Israel, his other neighbors, and the Western powers at sea, would enforce 
the U.N. embargo for him, which they are in a position to do. 
</P>
<P>
Syria's is a complex and brutal game of regional rivalry. Its president, Hafez 
Assad, has joined the embargo and is sending a contingent to the Arab forces in 
Saudi Arabia to advance Syrian interests and check his enemy, Saddam Hussein. 
Syria, though, is heavily engaged in Lebanon, where enthusiasm for the Iraqi 
leader is incandescent; and Lebanon is not a place today where one can be 
optimistic about enforcing embargoes. In Lebanon nothing is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's is a complex game, too, as it has every reason to wish its old enemy 
Saddam Hussein destroyed, yet every reason to wish him success in provoking a 
high international price for oil -- which is what he was doing when the United 
States stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president now is waging a successful political struggle by merging 
Islamic militance with pan-Arab nationalism. In modern times there have been 
two movements for pan-Arab renewal and "liberation," both utopian in 
intellectual and emotional appeal, the two in conflict with one another. One 
wanted theocracy, re-creation of the society that existed when the caliphs 
ruled an Islamic empire reaching from southern India to Spain. It includes 
Iranians and Islamic fundamentalists everywhere. The other movement is pan-Arab 
nationalism, which originated among Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals between 
the two world wars. One version has become the ideology of the dictatorships in 
both Syria and Iraq. Another was that of the most important modern Arab 
nationalist leader, Egypt's Nasser. His is the mantle Saddam Hussein wants to 
assume -- or usurp. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein went to war against Iran a decade ago to fight Islamic fundamentalism. 
Today he proclaims that he is defending Islam's holy places against American 
and Western infidels -- and he is taken seriously. (It is a politically 
incendiary fact that the American build-up takes place not far from Mecca and 
Medina, while Jerusalem, Islam's third holy place, is in Israel's hands.) 
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. embargo and Anglo-American blockade do not make Saddam Hussein 
disgorge Kuwait -- and they are not likely to do so -- the United States 
confronts a prospect either of military action in increasingly difficult 
political circumstances, or eventual withdrawal of its expeditionary force with 
whatever grace as can be managed. 
</P>
<P>
If the oil market stabilizes, as a result of increased Saudi and gulf 
production and of resumed measures of fuel substitution and conservation in the 
West, military action to free Kuwait will run against U.S. domestic political 
opposition to anything that risks U.S. casualties. And there is no way to take 
Kuwait away from Iraq by force that will not produce substantial American 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
This being so, the American military buildup seems increasingly 
disproportionate both to the current threat to Saudi Arabia and to the policy 
options before the United States. Forces now reported on the move or on alert 
include the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the 7th Light Infantry, the 24th 
Mechanized Division, two Marine Expeditionary Brigades, a battleship, four 
aircraft carriers, plus 50 or so other major fleet units, B-52s, Stealth 
bombers and fighters, F-111s, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Are they all eventually to be redeployed home with nothing accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
If the United States is not prepared to take Kuwait away from Iraq, the Arab 
League's decision to put troops into Saudi Arabia should have been accepted as 
evidence that the problem now was in Arab hands. The U.S. fleet could continue 
to monitor the embargo and the threat to Saudi Arabia, but American ground 
forces come out as Egyptians, Syrians and Moroccans go in. 
</P>
<P>
A considerable test has arrived of the seriousness, steadiness and policy 
competence of the Bush Administration. President Bush has made his point about 
America being a reliable ally. Saudi oil is secure for the present, and the 
international community is mobilized against Saddam Hussein. What now is the 
American aim? If it is the liberation of Kuwait, is this really within the Bush 
Administration's -- or the country's -- political means? Or will this huge and 
continuing deployment end on a dying fall, an exhibition without effect?

By SANDRA MACKEY, Sandra Mackey is the author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert 
Kingdom (Houghton-Mifflin, 1987). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with the daunting problems of logistics and desert heat, the American 
military command now on the ground in Saudi Arabia must also face the grim 
realities of its new partner -- the Saudi army. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars building a defense 
Establishment, while knowing that it could never fight a war. The backbone of 
the kingdom's defense strategy lay in reliance on the American commitment to 
the survival of an independent Saudi Arabia. With a relatively small population 
of men eligible for military service, the kingdom must defend 872,722 square 
miles, three coastlines and a northern border void of any natural defenses that 
stretches the width of the Arabian peninsula. But Saudi Arabia's defense 
problems go even deeper, into the very nature of its society and political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
More than a nation, Saudi Arabia is a fragile collection of fiercely 
independent individuals who resist incorporation into institutions. Culturally, 
Saudis are deeply marked by the Bedouin ethos, which holds that a man bows to 
no master, not even his government. The Saudis have lived within a state only 
since 1924, when the Bedouin army of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud finally subdued Mecca 
and the Western coastal plain and declared the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. With no 
fiscal resources with which to build a nation, Abdul Aziz brought the Bedouins 
of the desert and the merchants of the towns together through a series of loose 
alliances built on religious orthodoxy and the monarch's own 300 marriages into 
the kingdom's major families. Relationships with the ruler were personal, not 
institutional. Loyalty of the highly independent Saudis resided within their 
individual families. And identity remained with a specific region of this vast 
and vacant county. 
</P>
<P>
For the House of Saud, the system worked. The king ruled by drawing the people 
into the political system through their tribal chieftains and religious 
leaders. With the 1973 oil embargo, Saudi Arabia transformed economically but 
not politically. Rather than modernizing the political system through power 
sharing, the House of Saud simply turned its network of alliances into a golden 
pipeline through which the largess of the oil bonanza flowed to the citizenry. 
Dispensing electricity, water wells, housing, education, health care, grants 
and loans, the House of Saud held power unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
In order to insure its survival, the House of Saud fine-tuned its unique 
military structure. The military is constituted of two distinct parts: the 
regular forces -- army, navy and air -- whose mission is to defend the country 
against foreign threats, and the national guard, armed with sophisticated 
weapons and trained largely by former U.S. military men, which is charged with 
protecting the House of Saud against coups originating within the regular armed 
forces. The 25,000-man guard is drawn from the descendants of those who fought 
in Abdul Aziz's Bedouin army. Their loyalty lays within the old tribal 
alliances through which the first Saud ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The regular military, perhaps 50,000 men, is drawn out of the urban classes and 
from those with ambition but no family ties to the House of Saud. With 
attractive salaries and special privileges, the military forms one of Saudi 
Arabia's new elite. But beneath the uniforms and outside the plush officers' 
clubs, the defense Establishment lives under the cloud of the ruling family's 
paranoia.The top positions are held by members of the royal family. Non-royal 
brigade commanders and wing commanders are constantly shuffled to prevent the 
development of personal attachments between officers and men. For non-royals, 
initiative or efficiency elicits attention and arouses suspicion of clandestine 
motives, blocking the way to further promotion. Thus an armed force equipped 
with the best from the world's arms manufacturers atrophies as an organization. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between the guard and the regular force can be crippling in a 
crisis. When they were called into action in 1979 to dislodge religious 
fanatics who had seized the Grand Mosque at Mecca, competition among units 
paralyzed operations against the rebels. Order was restored only after the 
royal minister of defense arrived on the scene to personally take command. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Saud always understood the Saudis' fundamental resistance to the 
organization and discipline required by a national army. It also understood the 
weakness of its military structure, but was unwilling to sacrifice its own 
security to build as effective a defense force as its limited population could 
create. Instead, Saudi Arabia's rulers adopted in 1974 what remains its basic 
plan of defense: Rush all available manpower to a handful of fortified 
locations and hold on until the Americans arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans have now arrived. In this joint operation with incalculable 
risks, they will have to work with the Saudi defense force as it is.

Harold J. (Bud) Brennan, who gained fame as the fan who came out of the stands 
and tried to tackle football great Tom Harmon, has died of a heart attack. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan gained minor fame on Sept. 28, 1940 as a spectator at Memorial Stadium 
in Berkeley when Harmon's Michigan team came to play Cal and Harmon ran wild in 
a 41-0 rout. 
</P>
<P>
He ran the opening kickoff back 94 yards for a touchdown. He ran a punt back 72 
yards for another touchdown. On the next Michigan play, Harmon broke loose, and 
as he neared the goal line, Brennan raced out of the stands and attempted a 
tackle at the three-yard line. Harmon evaded Brennan, a former player at 
Oakland's Fremont High, and completed an 86-yard touchdown run.

SMITH PITCHES PIRATES INTO FIRST PLACE IN EAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates, after losing five games in a row, have moved into first 
place in the National League East by winning a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
With the New York Mets splitting their doubleheader against the Dodgers, 
recently acquired Zane Smith put the Pirates half a game ahead of the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Pirate ace Doug Drabek (15-5) pitched a six-hitter for a 3-1 victory over the 
Atlanta Braves in the first game at Pittsburgh. Although he was shaky in his 
first start since last Wednesday, when he came to the Pirates from Montreal, 
Smith lasted 7 1/3 innings as the Pirates won the nightcap, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates took a 6-1 lead for Smith (7-7). But Smith, formerly a Brave, had 
an earned-run average of 5.40 in three games against his former mates. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up four hits and four runs, three of them earned. Bob Paterson stopped 
a budding rally in the eighth inning, then struck out two in the ninth to get 
his third save. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla had three hits, including a homer, in the opener for the Pirates. 
Jeff King homered and drove in four runs in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Dave Justice hit his eighth home run in nine games to spoil Drabek's 
bid for a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 9, St. Louis 4 -- Jack Armstrong won for the first time since July 5 
as the Reds increased their lead in the West to 7 1/2 games by winning in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong (12-8) gave up two runs and five hits in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Benzinger had a two-run double in the first inning and a run-scoring 
single in the fourth as the Reds built an 8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, San Francisco 3 -- The Phillies tied the score at Philadelphia 
with a run in the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After that, they loaded the bases with one out and didn't score. In the 10th 
they loaded the bases with two out. In the 11th they loaded them with nobody 
out. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th, against Steve Bedrosian, they won it when he made a wild pitch 
with two out and Rod Booker on third base. Booker singled off Bedrosian (5-7) 
stole second and went to third on an infield out, the second out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies left 20 runners on base, 11 in the last five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Houston 2 -- Ryne Sandberg hit his league-leading 28th home run at 
Chicago and Greg Maddux won for the sixth time in his last seven starts. Maddux 
(10-10) struggled through 7 2/3 innings, working out of several jams. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg hit 14 home runs in June and 24 in his first 74 games. But he had only 
one in the next 34 games and has two in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 8, San Diego 3 -- Otis Nixon went four for four, including his first 
home run in almost five years, and drove in four runs at San Diego. It was the 
sixth victory in a row for the Expos, trying to stay in the running in the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez pitched his second consecutive complete game to end the Padres' 
four-game winning streak. DAN HAFNER

Classic Expands: Coca-Cola is shifting its focus to Europe and the Pacific, 
where profit margins are five times higher than in the United States. For the 
concentrate that makes a case of eight-ounce servings, the company earns 11% in 
the United States, 58% in West Germany and 44% in Japan. Consumption overseas, 
however, is relatively low. Americans drink 283 servings per capita per year, 
Japanese 53 and Indonesians just four. Atlanta Constitution

Office Discounter: Staples, an office supply discounter with 48 stores in the 
Northeast, is considering a move into Southern California. Los Angeles seems 
the logical choice because the company specializes in markets characterized by 
high costs for rent, labor and advertising. It keeps labor costs down with 
sophisticated use of a warehouse to supply branch outlets and shuns traditional 
advertising in favor of direct marketing to office managers. Nation's Business

Growth Industry: According to an annual market study by Richard K. Miller &amp;

growth of segments within that industry varies widely. The air pollution 
control market, valued last year at $36 billion, is expected to grow 5% next

PEOPLE: 2 EXECUTIVES WILL HEAD GOLDMAN SACHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., a giant investment bank and brokerage, will install a 
pair of executives to replace John L. Weinberg when he steps down later this 
year as senior partner and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg, 65, plans to retire after 14 years as senior partner and chairman of 
the management committee at the end of the firm's fiscal year Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said its co-vice chairmen for the past three years, Robert E. Rubin 
and Stephen Friedman, will share Weinberg's titles after he retires. 
</P>
<P>
Naming a pair of executives to head a firm is becoming more common as the 
complexity of running businesses has escalated. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, for instance, named co-chief executives, 
William A. Grant and Robert J. Kelly, after the merger of the firms Arthur 
Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney last year. 
</P>
<P>
The media and entertainment giant Time Warner Inc. also is run by co-chief 
executives, Steven J. Ross and Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. The firm was created in 
a merger earlier this year of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg shared the job of chairman of the management committee when he was 
appointed to it in 1976 with John C. Whitehead. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg has been the sole chairman since November, 1984, after Whitehead 
retired and later became deputy secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs is one of the last major privately held investment firms on Wall 
Street and has about 6,400 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
It ranked third among investment firms behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and 
Shearson Lehman Bros. in terms of capital at the start of the year, according 
to the Securities Industry Assn. The firm has a solid reputation in mergers and 
acquisitions, equity underwriting, corporate advisory services, trading and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg cited both the pressures of the job and his desire to pursue private 
interests as reasons for his decision to step down from a post he called "the 
greatest job in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The senior partner's position "is a seven days a week, 52 weeks a year 
responsibility and it requires a total commitment. The pressures are often very 
intense," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg said the firm is in excellent condition with a strong capital position 
and earnings running somewhat ahead of last year's. He said its prospects for 
growth were bright. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure at the top of the firm, Weinberg said its annual profits rose 
about tenfold and its equity capital grew to $2.3 billion from about $80 
million at the end of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg will continue as senior chairman of the firm, responsible for client 
relationships and other unspecified activities. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Rubin and Friedman said they "look forward to continuing 
on the course that we have set and followed together." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1950 and became a partner in 1956. He was 
named senior partner and co-chairman of the management committee in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 51, joined Goldman Sachs in 1966, became a partner in 1971 and a member 
of the management committee in 1980. He formerly headed the trading and 
arbitrage division and previously oversaw the firm's commodity and foreign

COUNTY ART MUSEUM MOUNTS A SUPERB SHOW FROM THE WALTER ANNENBERG COLLECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a rough century. Now, here at the end of it, we are enchanted with 
art made in France in the twilight of the last century. Impressionism and 
Post-Impressionism appeared when European life was marked by private anxiety 
and public self-satisfaction, much as the West is today. Their discontinuities 
were more civilized, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The French scorned the art. Supporters had to wage a battle to get the Louvre 
to accept a gift of it. We have come to embrace it with the enthusiasm of a 
mother clasping her first grandchild. Starting Thursday, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art hosts a traveling exhibition of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg 
Collection" consists of 54 paintings regularly characterized by insiders as the 
very finest compendium of its kind still in private hands. There are six works 
each by Renoir and Monet, eight Cezannes, four Gauguins, five Van Goghs and 
signature masterpieces you thought must surely belong to great museums -- 
Gauguin's "La Siesta" and Van Gogh's "La Berceuse," among others. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to imagine a show with such popular appeal and professional pedigree 
opening with strikes against it, but there are a few. First, there's the danger 
the super-hip will feel obliged to disdain such beloved art on principle. Then, 
there is the problem of current art prices so obscenely escalated that visitors 
might look at, say, Picasso's "Au Lapin Agile" and see nothing but the $40.7 
million that Annenberg paid at auction. Finally, there is the unseemly and 
slightly ghoulish speculation that has dogged the tour, wondering which museum 
is finally going to receive all this loot if Walter Annenberg decides to donate 
this art to a public collection. People used to have better manners. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone anxious that all that will somehow cloud minds and taint enjoyment can 
happily forget it. One look and all secondary considerations just drop away. 
It's a superb show chocked with pleasure, passion and revelation. Undoubtedly 
it will pack in the public until it closes on Nov. 11. The wise are forewarned 
-- one needs a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Conisbee, LACMA curator of European painting and sculpture, has spaced 
the work out leisurely in six capacious galleries. He caused walls to be 
painted in subdued tones that key off the assembled works and make them look 
sumptuous without getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged in rough chronological order, the tour begins with such Impressionist 
precursors as Camille Corot, whose "The Curious Little Girl" turns to us from 
peering over a fence. She reveals a face at once innocent and smoldering, like 
that of the child in the graveyard in Thomas Mann's "Tonio Kruger." Corot's 
concentration on depicting weight and roundness keeps his pictures in the past. 
Henri Fantin-Latour's flower still lifes stay there, too, despite wistful 
delicacy. Eugene Boudin influenced Monet, but the loosening brushwork in his 
beach scenes looks more like a formula for simplification than a quest for a 
new way to paint. His pictures remain as quaint as his formally dressed 
subjects, who sit on the beach on stiff wooden chairs. 
</P>
<P>
When we encounter the first Monets and Degases something new happens. Their 
work is on our side of the historical Rubicon. They have followed Baudelaire's 
advice and depicted the modern world in a modern way, making the first art that 
holds up a mirror in which we can still see ourselves today, albeit barely. The 
modernity of Monet's and Degas' work is subtle, as befits the French, but 
unmistakable. So subtle, in fact, that one wonders at the fuss and ostracism 
that greeted this work. What was that all about? Simple enough. The French of 
the fin de siecle were as worried about the arrival of the modern world as we 
are about its departure. They were afraid of progress. Down with the Tour 
Eiffel. We are afraid of grinding o a halt. Up with the Trump Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Folks out for a nice time in the galleries love the Impressionists for their 
worship of the good, simple life -- perfect sparkling Sunday afternoons in the 
country, cafes full of saucy girls and dashing dandies, draped living rooms 
with pianos and pretty children like Renoir's "The Daughters of Catulle 
Mendes." The scene is so seductive you barely notice the tension between 
Renoir's desire to combine the surface of the present with the structure of the 
past, but it shows in the doll-like stiffness of the figures. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionism is pleasant and reassuring of a middle-class beatific vision. 
People don't usually notice the ennui and melancholy that lurk in even the most 
beautiful of these pictures, forecasting urban alienation. Berthe Morisot's 
pearly "The Pink Dress" has deep poignancy that carries right over to Edouard 
Vuillard's "The Album." The seven female figures in the Vuillard nearly 
disappear into the wallpaper until one head firms up like a Vermeer. It's like 
Proust's Swann discovering his love, Odette. 
</P>
<P>
Careful viewers value the Impressionists for the serious way they explored the 
use of paint and visual possibilities behind their dappled facades. Monet and 
later Seurat broke up the color spectrum in a way that was a metaphor for our 
century's scientific vision -- probing until the whole universe is caught being 
made of the same particulate matter. Musical types can scan the six-foot-plus 
swath of Monet's grand water lilies and hear Debussy. Artniks know Jackson 
Pollock would have been impossible without Monet. The Impressionist sensibility 
could be mistaken for ours in the 1950s. The Impressionists were classier, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Every gallery has at least one drop-dead masterpiece and the first is Edgar 
Degas' "At the Milliner's." How could even an egghead resist its drowsy 
three-o'clock afternoon charm and the intimacy of the woman helping her friend 
try on a new straw bonnet? If the scene is nostalgic, the vision is still new. 
With its tipped floor and cropped edges, this is a scene we'll only see for 
seconds out of the corner of an eye. Slow action, fast take. Very timely. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Impressionism offers satisfaction to such a broad audience 
defines it as one of those breathless moments of harmonic artistic balance that 
genuinely offers something of value to the most and least demanding members of 
the audience. Such instants are rare and never last. Post-Impressionism 
sustained the moment even as it headed to a crossroad that would fraction off 
the popular audience and make art into an insider's game for most of modern 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The Impressionist vision was middle-class and stay-at-home. It flirted with 
japonisme about the same way Gilbert and Sullivan did in "The Mikado." It was 
up to the Post-Impressionists to dig deeper into the exotic, the primitive and 
-- with seeming contradiction -- the purely formal. They set the prototype for 
the modern Bohemian and invented the counterculture. They were the ancestors of 
hippies. Better artists, of course. 
</P>
<P>
If the county museum owned only the pictures in the rooms devoted to Cezanne, 
Gauguin and Van Gogh, it would be transformed into a great repository at a 
stroke. The Cezannes manage to define the artist in just eight pictures. A 
still life and a Mont Sainte-Victoire encapsulate the monumental effort of 
pictorial logic that would lead to Cubism. A picture of a monk captures his 
ascetic dedication and an abandoned house speaks of his isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh has become so universally revered it's almost impossible to talk about 
him. Luckily we can still look at him, and the Annenberg pictures find him at 
his gentlest. His "Vase of Roses" was done at the asylum at Saint-Remy in a 
period of calm. White blossoms standing against a pale green background make a 
haiku-like simile of petals that will fall like snow. "La Berceuse" is a 
portrait of the wife of his friend, postman Joseph Roulin. The chunky, 
cloisonne image lives somewhere between the Middle Ages and rural Japan. 
</P>
<P>
These artists combined human and pictorial basics in ways that would lead to 
bottom-line abstraction, gutsy Expressionism and -- in Gauguin -- primitivism. 
Annenberg, however, likes them relaxed. The deep blue gallery devoted to 
Gauguin is dominated by his wonderful, easy Tahitian masterpiece, "La Siesta." 
No artist since Watteau had painted a back so eloquent as that of the central 
figure. We learn all about her from her earthy foot, faux-native sarong, gauzy 
blouse and the perky straw hat that speaks of youthful humor and zing. 
</P>
<P>
The curator says his final gallery is "something of a grab-bag." It bounces 
around from Lautrec's brooding, big-bottomed hooker to Braque's crystalline 
"The Studio" and Matisse's eccentric odalisque, but a kind of theme emerges. 
We're back in sleazy, sophisticated, bewitching Paris. Picasso's 1905 "Au Lapin 
Agile" finds the artist youthfully cynical about the fleshpots after the death 
of his best friend, Carlos Casagemas. Structurally, the painting shows him 
trying out the use of multiple modes of perception. He combines poster flatness 
with carved-out drawing, shifting gears for the 20th Century with its clashing 
angles of view. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe what we really like about this art is an encouragement hidden within it. 
If they could leave such a legacy from the tumultuous end of their century, 
maybe we can survive the end of ours, Saddam Hussein notwithstanding.

Linda's Sings the Blues: Linda's, the Melrose Avenue restaurant and nightclub 
where many of Los Angeles' top pianists and singers held forth, closed Monday. 
Owner Linda Keegan blamed the closure on diminished patronage -- caused in 
turn, she said, by the 1988 Writers Guild strike, negative publicity resulting 
from a three-day Internal Revenue Service seizure for non-payment of taxes in 
April, and a lack of on-street parking. Keegan is looking for both a place to 
live -- she resided at Linda's -- and a place to work. BETH KLEID

Where Oh Where Is the O'Keeffe Painting?: A Georgia O'Keeffe painting has been 
formally declared "lost" by the Art Institute of Chicago, 20 years after a 
search for the misplaced painting began. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the museum had continued to hope over two decades that "East River 
from the Shelton" would turn up, institute director James Woods said Tuesday. 
But after a recent inventory of 1,500 pieces in the museum's department of 
20th-Century paintings and sculpture, Wood said officials acknowledged that the 
painting was nowhere to be found. The 1926 work, valued between $250,000 and 
$500,000, depicts the view from a Manhattan hotel in which O'Keeffe and her 
husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz, lived. BETH KLEID

Heston Resigns From Actors Equity Over 'Saigon': Charlton Heston announced 
Tuesday that he is resigning his membership in Actors Equity, saying he was 
angered by the controversy the union sparked when it barred British star 
Jonathan Pryce from the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon." "Actors Equity 
was the first union I joined," Heston said in a letter to the union. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, I've always been proud of my membership. I'm now deeply ashamed. 
The council's obscenely racist rejection of Jonathan Pryce's right to play the 
part he created in 'Miss Saigon' revolts me." The play's producer Cameron 
Mackintosh canceled the production following the union's vote last week to 
oppose the casting. The union is expected to consider the issue on Thursday.

'QUIXOTE DE LA JOLLA': MANY JOKES, LITTLE PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for the talent show at La Jolla Playhouse Summer Camp. 
</P>
<P>
That's what "Don Quixote de La Jolla" amounts to -- happy campers showing off 
for a friendly audience. Lots of self-referential humor. Allusions to other 
plays, movies, obscure Actors' Equity policies, the National Endowment for the 
Arts, the lambada and, yes, "Don Quixote." Pirandellian pratfalls. Props that 
look homemade or bought from a practical-jokes store. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, these particular campers are unusually talented. Onstage are the 
clown, Geoff Hoyle ("The Fool Show," La Jolla, 1988), funny sidekicks Robert 
Dorfman and Ellen McElduff and one-woman band Gina Leishman. Behind the scenes 
are playwright Eric Overmyer ("On the Verge, or the Geography of Yearning") and 
director Stan Wojewodski Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The conceit -- and apparently the reality -- is that these people came to La 
Jolla a few weeks ago to stitch together something called "Don Quixote de La 
Jolla." Hoyle is cast as the Man of La Mancha, Dorfman plays a New York actor 
who is assigned the role of Sancho Panza and McElduff plays the blond bombshell 
who is charged with the role of Dulcinea. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, to quote Overmyer's script, "the play doesn't seem very set, 
does it?" 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem all that funny, either. Which is a big problem, because there 
is nothing here except the jokes. 
</P>
<P>
The show's creators talked of more ambitious aims in preopening interviews. 
Reading those quotes, one would expect to be moved as well as amused. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. While this show does require a broader cultural literacy than might 
be needed at the Comedy Store, it's no less punch-line oriented. The tone 
hardly ever transcends aren't-we-clever and its corollary: 
aren't-you-clever-for-understanding-our-jokes. Any attempt to show us our own 
plight, or even that of these actors, as parallel to Don Quixote's or anyone 
else's, takes a faraway back seat to all the hip yuk-yuks. 
</P>
<P>
Those yuks are of varying quality -- depending on your personal sense of humor. 
Hoyle does an uncanny impersonation of a man vomiting, which will surely 
disgust as many people as it entertains (count me among the latter). The 
quartet dons Zapata-style mustaches for a brief mariachi number. Silly, yes, 
but good for a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight is the stream of cross-references to "Waiting for Godot," 
culminating in a scene in which fog covers the stage and the Boy from "Godot" 
(Hoyle's son Jonah) encounters Don Quixote and Sancho -- a couple of guys who 
are not accustomed to waiting. This scene very briefly sets off the sort of 
larger speculation that might have made the show more challenging, more 
rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyle is the only one onstage who takes "Don Quixote" seriously. And because 
the script doesn't take the book seriously at all, Hoyle's act comes off -- 
intentionally, no doubt -- as a bit pompous and -- unintentionally, no doubt -- 
as one-dimensional. Dorfman and McElduff are allowed to move in and out of 
character, creating a few comic sparks as they go. 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman gets many of his laughs from debunking the book, in his guise of 
smooth-talking American actor. He points out how "the windmill thing comes 
down" too early in the book for maximum dramatic impact; why can't they 
rearrange the story to save the best for last? He notes how the 
buddy/road/male-bonding genre is getting stale. 
</P>
<P>
McElduff comes on as Marilyn Monroe, complete with the famous white dress that 
rises in an updraft. She also gets the show's best costume change (designer: 
Christine Dougherty) when she finally consents to put on the fat-housekeeper 
outfit she has been resisting. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the freewheeling nature of this enterprise, the actors were very 
precise and knowing on opening night. Leishman adds valuable musical support. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing is as funny as it's supposed to be. The in-joking (a half-dozen 
references to La Jolla artistic director Des McAnuff) is tiresome. The show 
looks very post-modern, but is it all that different from the old days of La 
Jolla Playhouse, when Hollywood stars would come down the coast for a summer 
workout, more or less as a lark? 
</P>
<P>
While these aren't Hollywood stars, it still feels as if this 
Playhouse-commissioned show is hardly a major priority in the careers of its 
creators (with the possible exception of Hoyle, who thought it up). Otherwise, 
they would surely have something more pressing to say, something more 
passionate to express.

Eastern Gets Break: A federal bankruptcy judge in New York granted Eastern 
Airlines temporary relief from major provisions in its labor contract with 
pilots. "It is clear that prompt cost reductions, including pilot labor cost 
reductions, are essential if an imminent liquidation of the estate is to be 
avoided," Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland said in his ruling. The pilots' union 
issued a statement saying it was disappointed but not surprised by the court 
action.

AGENCY TRIES TO MAKE 2 TESTIFY ON NEIL BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: REGULATORS WANT THE EX-THRIFT OFFICIALS TO RELATE THEIR DISCUSSIONS 
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S SON ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

Federal regulators are seeking subpoenas to compel testimony about Neil Bush by 
two former top executives of the failed Denver thrift where the President's son 
served as a director, according to documents issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been charged in an administrative proceeding with violating 
conflict-of-interest rules for failing to disclose his business ties with two 
Denver developers, Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good, who were major 
customers at Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. The two men defaulted 
on $130 million in loans from Silverado, contributing to the eventual 
insolvency of the S&amp;L and its takeover by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators want Michael Wise, former Silverado chairman and chief 
executive, and Russell M. Murray, former executive vice president, to testify 
under oath about their discussions with Bush concerning possible 
conflict-of-interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
Wise said he will invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against 
self-incrimination and refuse to answer any questions about the President's 
son, according to documents issued Tuesday by the federal Office of Thrift 
Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
There is a contradiction between a letter that Wise signed and testimony from 
Bush. Wise prepared a letter in 1985 to preferred shareholders and directors, 
saying that Bush "has agreed to abstain from any board consideration regarding 
Silverado's relationship with Mr. Walters or Mr. Good . . ." The letter was 
written just before Bush joined the Silverado board. 
</P>
<P>
Bush insists that he never made such a promise. "I did not agree with Wise to 
abstain from any board considerations regarding Silverado's relations with 
Walters or Good . . . ," he said in written testimony released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wise told Congress that he could not recall sending the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Also made public was testimony from two men who served on Silverado's board 
with Bush. They stated that they did not know the extent of Bush's dealings 
with Walters, links that the OTS charges amounted to conflicts of interest 
because Bush voted on transactions involving Walters. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not recall knowing that Mr. Walters was a partner in Mr. Bush's oil and 
gas exploration company," said Richard J. Bunchman, a Breckenridge, Colo., real 
estate operator. He said he also did not know that Cherry Creek National Bank, 
whose majority shareholder was Walters, had extended more than $1 million in 
credit to Bush's firm or that Bush's company owed Walter's company -- and later 
Walters personally -- $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Richard F. Vitkus, a West Hartford, Conn., lawyer, also said that he did not 
recall Bush disclosing to the Silverado board those ties to Walters. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, submitted Monday, Bush said he had not disclosed to Silverado 
directors Walters Petroleum's 6.25% interest in his oil exploration firm. He 
also did not disclose his firm's subsequent indebtedness to Walters Petroleum 
or to Cherry Creek National Bank, or his personal guarantee of part of the 
firm's debt to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"I never considered these facts material to the board's consideration," Bush 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The government wants Murray, the former Silverado executive, subpoenaed to 
relate his discussions with Bush about a proposed $900,000 line of credit at 
Silverado. Bush sought the money on behalf of Good International, a firm 
controlled by Kenneth Good. Bush's oil exploration firm, JNB, was affiliated 
with Good International in a plan to do business in Argentina.

 Sparkler Dumping Charges to be Probed: The U.S. government has agreed to 
investigate charges that imported Chinese sparklers are being sold in the 
United States at less that fair value. 
</P>
<P>
The International Trade Commission ruled 4-0 that there is reason to believe 
the Chinese imports threaten material damage to the domestic sparkler industry. 
That means the Commerce Department will open an anti-dumping investigation, 
with preliminary findings due by Dec. 10. Government figures show that starting 
in 1988, Chinese sparklers captured more than half of the U.S. market.

Toyota, Distributor Reach Accord: A privately owned distributor of Toyotas has 
dropped its fight to block the Japanese car maker from taking over the company. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors Inc. said a tentative 
agreement was reached over the weekend between Mid-Atlantic and Toyota Motor 
Sales U.S.A. The terms of the settlement were not immediately disclosed. 
Mid-Atlantic, which distributes Toyotas in a five-state region, went to court 
in June to block the takeover. The company, owned by Los Angeles millionaire 
Frederick R. Weisman, was supported by more than 30 members of Congress in its 
brief fight.

RETAIL SALES IN JULY RISE 0.1%; ANALYSTS FEAR SLUMP AHEAD

Retail sales rose a slight 0.1% during July, the Commerce Department said 
Tuesday, a second straight monthly gain that analysts warn may be nipped in the 
bud by rising energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
The July gain, following a revised 1.1% June increase in total sales, normally 
would be seen as an indication that consumers are spending enough to keep the 
economy moving sluggishly higher. 
</P>
<P>
But against the backdrop of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the picture was 
viewed as more threatening. The June and July sales gains followed three 
straight months of declines between March and May and flat sales in February. 
Before June, the last significant monthly sales rise was a 2.8% increase in 
January. The slight pickup during July brought total sales to a seasonally 
adjusted $149.5 billion and was led by a 3.9% increase in sales of building 
materials after a 3.2% June rise.

TECATE: BEER IMPORT THAT'S NOT FLAT; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: SALES OF THE MEXICAN BREW ARE UP 12%. DEMAND FOR FOREIGN BEVERAGES 
OVERALL HAS LEVELED. 
</P>

<P>
These are tough times for beer importers, but one Mexican beer is bucking the 
trend. And no, it doesn't come in that familiar clear glass bottle. 
</P>
<P>
After years of growth, sales of imported beer slowed for the first time in 
1989, and industry analysts are predicting a continued decline in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to the declining popularity of imports is Tecate, a Mexican lager 
beer that saw its sales jump 12% last year to $32 million. Tecate's growth came 
at the expense of its once-trendy rival, Mexico's Corona beer, which saw its 
sales plunge 23% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Tecate has benefited from its popularity with Latinos consumers, according to 
executives of Wisdom Import Sales Co., an Irvine firm that distributes Tecate 
and several other brands of Mexican beer -- not including Corona -- in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wisdom executives said Tecate is particularly popular among new immigrants from 
Mexico, and the company targets promotions to the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic community in Southern California drinks Tecate because it is a 
national brand in Mexico -- a brand many Mexican immigrants are familiar with," 
said John Lennon, Wisdom's marketing manager. "When they move to the United 
States, it is something they can identify with life at home." 
</P>
<P>
Another important factor in Tecate's success has been the growing buying power 
of Latinos in the United States. "The more they earn, the more they tend to 
consume products from Mexico," said Manuel Rubiralta, the Mexican-born 
president of Wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Tecate's growth has made it one of the 10 best-selling imported beers in the 
nation. Of the top 10 imported beers, however, only Tecate, Labatt's Blue of 
Canada and Amstel Light of the Netherlands managed to post sales increases in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of 1990, beer imports were down 2.7% from the same 
period last year, according to the National Beer Wholesalers Assn. in Falls 
Church, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say a weak dollar has raised the price of imported beers for 
U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, importers and distributors have responded to 
shrinking sales by trimming their advertising budgets. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Mazzoni, vice president of Chicago-based Barton Beer Ltd., 
which is one of two Corona importers in the nation, sales of Corona beer 
nationwide are expected to drop between 6% and 10% by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Tecate's sales, in contrast, were up 18% during the first six months of 1990, 
the company says. 
</P>
<P>
While Corona gained wide popularity among beer drinkers in the 1980s, analysts 
say the brand failed to catch on with Latino consumers. Mazzoni blamed the 
sales decline on more aggressive marketing efforts by U.S. beer makers and a 
nine-week strike by Corona employees in Mexico City. But Peter Reid, editor of 
the trade publication Modern Brewery Age, faults Corona for failing to step up 
its marketing when its customers were defecting in droves to domestic labels. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for Tecate's sales growth, analysts say, is price and packaging. 
A six-pack of Tecate currently sells at wholesale for about $4.50, compared to 
$5 or more for a six-pack of Corona. Analysts also note that canned beer has 
been growing in popularity, while sales of bottled beer have declined. Tecate 
is sold in both cans and bottles, while Corona is available only in its 
distinctive bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also praise Wisdom management for making a far-sighted decision in the 
mid-1980s to expand distribution beyond 13 Western states to all 50 states. The 
move was intended to capture the Latino market as well as convert others at a 
time when Mexican food was gaining popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more acceptability of Mexican brands in the American market and, with 
that in mind, we decided to distribute nationwide," Rubiralta said. "We found 
that when people eat Mexican food, they inevitably drink Mexican beer." 
</P>
<P>
Rubiralta, 46, is seen as another reason for Tecate's success. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to become one of the nation's top beer importers, Rubiralta engineered 
the merger in 1987 of his company with Cibco Importer Inc. of Houston, which 
owns the distribution rights of Tecate beer in the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the move made Wisdom the third-largest beer importer in the 
nation. Following the merger, Frank Wisdom, the company's chairman, promoted 
Rubiralta to president of the firm, the first non-family member to run the 
company. Wisdom, which was sold three years ago to Grupo Visa S.A. of 
Monterrey, Mexico, is currently the country's fifth-largest beer importer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Tecate, Wisdom's list of Mexican imports include Carta Blanca, Bohemia 
and Chihuahua beers. Last year, the importer sold 6 million cases of beer in 
the United States, worth about $60 million. This year, the company expects 
sales to reach about $72 million. 
</P>
<P>
But while sales are up, Rubiralta is troubled by some recent developments. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a trend among beer wholesalers to merge, which makes it difficult for 
us to distribute our beers," Rubiralta noted. With 410 foreign brands competing 
and a shrinking number of distributors, wholesalers are swamped, sometimes 
delaying deliveries of the beers to retailers, he added.

Manville Asbestos Trust Overhaul Advances: An appeals court has cleared the way 
for a federal judge in Brooklyn to continue his efforts to overhaul the 
cash-strapped Manville personal injury trust. In the ruling, the U.S. 2nd 
Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion by lawyers for more than 1,000 
asbestos victims to stop the efforts by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who 
has indicated that he wants the Manville trust to be converted into a national 
fund to pay claims against the less financially secure defendants.

GAO SAYS MEXICO GOT A SUBSIDY FROM BOND SALE; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE WATCHDOG AGENCY SAYS THE LATIN NATION GOT A $192-MILLION BREAK IN 
ITS DEBT. THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT DISPUTES THE CHARGE.

<P>
Congressional investigators Tuesday charged the Treasury Department with giving 
Mexico a $192-million subsidy by selling it underpriced bonds to help it reduce 
its foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury disputed the General Accounting Office allegation, saying that not 
only did Mexico not receive a subsidized price but that the bonds actually went 
for a premium. 
</P>
<P>
David Mulford, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said the 
zero-coupon 30-year bonds were sold at an interest rate of 8.05%, higher than 
the 7.92% the Treasury was paying at the time to raise funds for the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds were used to partially guarantee debt that Mexico restructured under 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's 1989 initiative to help ease developing 
nations' debt burden. Mexico restructured about $50 billion in debt to foreign 
banks, which had the option of reducing principal, reducing interest or 
providing new loans. The country still has a $95-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Zeros" -- as they are commonly called -- pay interest and principal in one 
transaction at maturity and thus are sold at deep discount from face value. The 
higher the interest rate, the lower the initial cash cost. 
</P>
<P>
According to the GAO, the Treasury had two interest rate options for pricing 
the zeros: the market for "strips" and the market for 30-year Treasury coupon 
bonds. The strip market was created by dealers who separate a Treasury bond's 
interest payment from its principal payment and sell rights to those payments 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Brady chose to base the zeros' price on the interest rate of the 30-year bond 
market. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Treasury on March 28 sold Mexico $30.2 billion in zero-coupon 
bonds for $2.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 5 decision provided Mexico with a $192-million "effective subsidy" -- 
in the form of a lower price for the bonds, the GAO said. The interest rate, 
based on the market for three days ending Jan. 5, was 7.925%, plus a fee of 
0.125%. 
</P>
<P>
If the zeros' price had been based on the 7.708% yield of the strips market, 
Treasury would have received $192 million more for the bonds, the GAO charged. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO's charges may influence negotiations between Venezuela and its bank 
creditors since the South American country is expected to request Treasury 
support for a debt-reduction package similar to that obtained by Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Mendelowitz, a GAO director, told the House Banking Committee that while 
Brady had the legal authority to provide Mexico with a subsidy, his decision 
was "neither appropriate nor good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
"There was no subsidy," Mendelowitz said.

Scam artists are already trying to cash in on escalating oil and gold prices 
resulting from the Middle East crisis, officials at the state Department of 
Corporations said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Player, an investigator for the Department of Corporations, said he has 
already received complaints from out-of-state investors contacted by California 
con artists trying to capitalize on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and recent 
rise of gold prices to above $400 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
"One outfit I heard about in the last week claimed to have bought up mineral 
rights to a bunch of property in Colombia," said Player. "They were raising 
money to buy dredging equipment to mine gold out of streams and rivers." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Corporations on Tuesday joined with the North American 
Securities Administrators Assn., a group of state securities regulators, in 
issuing a bulletin to warn investors about the latest scams. 
</P>
<P>
"Con artists follow the headlines," said Christine W. Bender, California 
commissioner of corporations. "After the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, the 1979 
revolution in Iran and the 'tanker war' during the Iran-Iraq conflict, 
telemarketers were burning up the phone lines offering investors get-rich-quick 
opportunities to cash in on the conflict by investing in oil and gas deals or 
precious metals." 
</P>
<P>
Questionable oil and gold investments are usually sold over the telephone by 
unregistered sales people working in "boiler rooms." Boiler rooms, named for 
the basements they traditionally were housed in, are companies that employ 
high-pressure telephone sales people to push a variety of illegal investment 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, especially Orange County, is home to an estimated 300 
boiler rooms, Bender said. State law requires anyone selling investments over 
the phone to be registered, but scores of companies continue to operate in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical oil well scam, Bender said potential investors are offered an 
opportunity to invest $5,000 to $10,000 in an oil or gas limited partnership. 
Unfortunately, the wells are usually dry, non-existent or belong to someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Player urges consumers to question anyone who offers an investment opportunity 
over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let these people con you," said Player. "You can call the Department of 
Corporations to see if the investment is registered and qualified to be sold in 
California." The number of the department's investigation division is (213) 
736-2520.

1-DAY BOYCOTT OF GASOLINE PURCHASES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Southland radio station has begun urging radio broadcasters in other parts of 
the country to ask listeners to boycott gas stations on Thursday to protest 
price rises. 
</P>
<P>
KGGI-FM in Riverside is asking consumers to purchase gas any day this week 
except Thursday and to show support for the protest by driving with their 
headlights on. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott is designed to signal opposition to the increases in gasoline 
prices following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The local campaign was launched by Jeff Dean and Jim Daniels on "Breakfast 
Club," a KGGI morning program featuring Top 40 pop hits. However, the protest 
was expanded when the station's general manager relayed news of the campaign to 
La Jolla-based New World Communications, KGGI's programming consultant. Cliff 
Berkowitz, vice president of marketing and promotions at New World, then 
contacted radio station clients in various parts of the country in an effort to 
rally support for the boycott campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Dean and Daniels "have said that the oil companies will use any excuse to raise 
prices," Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz said 14 stations agreed to promote the boycott. Those stations, in 
turn, began to contact other radio broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
"Stations in San Francisco, Atlanta, Orlando, Charlotte, Houston and San 
Antonio are picking up on this," Berkowitz said. "Probably 50 stations are 
participating by now. . . . Locally, people are really getting behind this." 
</P>
<P>
However, some radio program hosts are critical of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a stupid idea," said Tom Leykis, a talk show host on KFI-AM in 
Los Angeles. "I think it's opportunistic, and I think it will accomplish 
absolutely nothing."

YAROSLAVSKY SAYS L.A. FACES FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Already financially strapped, Los Angeles is heading for a severe economic 
crisis because of problems in the Middle East and an unanticipated downturn in 
the local economy, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Only six weeks into the new fiscal year, the city's reserve fund already is 
down to $10 million, substantially lower than the $45 million available at the 
same time last year, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the council's Budget and Finance Committee, Yaroslavsky has 
asked city administrators to come up with a contingency plan to address the 
shortfalls. A continued city hiring freeze is certain, he said, and layoffs are 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to cut back now," Yaroslavsky said. "We're still spending more than 
we're taking in." 
</P>
<P>
At Yaroslavsky's insistence, the City Council already has forced city 
department heads to drastically cut back their requests for money for the 
1990-91 fiscal year, which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's financial position has deteriorated further in the three months 
since that budget was approved, Yaroslavsky said, and further cuts will be 
necessary to head off a budget deficit that could reach $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
As an initial measure, Yaroslavsky said, he will ask the City Council to delay 
indefinitely the proposed purchase of $27 million in equipment that is to be 
considered at today's council meeting. The money had been earmarked for the 
Fire and Police departments as well as the Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley agrees with Yaroslavsky's proposal to delay the equipment 
purchases, but issued no statement Tuesday about the city's overall budget 
outlook, said Vallee Bunting, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradley first proposed the current $3.6-billion budget last April, he said 
the city was on a financial tightrope that made necessary an array of new and 
increased taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, in a letter to City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie, said this 
week that that budget was adopted "with the expectation that our national and 
regional economies would continue to grow at a modest rate." The budget now 
appears optimistic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City tax revenues have been declining because of continuing layoffs and plant 
closures in the aerospace industry, lagging retail sales and decreased tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Middle East has driven up gasoline prices and greatly 
increased costs to the city, which is a major purchaser of fuel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, officials have been slow to begin collecting a new 10% city parking 
tax, which was to have brought in $22.5 million this year, he said. The actual 
revenue from the tax will be far lower, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are faced with a situation where our revenue prospects are shrinking, our 
expenses are growing and our reserve fund is inadequate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement of just three or four substantial lawsuits against the city 
could wipe out the fund entirely, he added.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. GETS ANOTHER SISTER CITY -- LENINGRAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayors of Los Angeles and Leningrad signed an agreement Monday to encourage 
business ventures and cultural exchanges between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad joins Los Angeles' 16 other sister cities, and is the first Soviet 
city in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Before signing the "sister city" agreement at a City Hall ceremony, Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak spoke about the possibilities of 
creating "strong bonds of friendship" and cultural exchanges between the two 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Sobchak, who recently resigned from the Communist Party, also said that a new 
free economic zone in his city would make it easier for Los Angeles 
entrepreneurs to invest in his country.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLITICAL COMMITTEE PAYS $300 FINE UNDER 
PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small Torrance political action committee has paid a $300 city fine for 
failing to file campaign finance reports, but leaders of the group say they 
believe the city clerk should have notified them of the filing rules. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rizzardi, treasurer of the Protect Our Property Committee, said he paid 
the fine last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid the $300 because we have not been notified of an appeal process, and, 
second, we don't have the money to hire an attorney," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bill Applegate complained this spring that he could not find 
any city records on Protect Our Property, which had excluded his name from an 
endorsement letter issued during the city March election campaign. The city 
clerk's office, after a review, concluded the group had last filed a report in 
1986.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESTAURANT MANAGER KILLS HIS WIFE, HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica restaurant manager shot his wife to death during a marital 
dispute late Monday night, then turned the gun on himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers found Damaso Acosta, 42, the manager of Biff's 
restaurant, and his wife, Maria, 36, in the bedroom of their home in the 1100 
block of El Paso Drive in Mount Washington at 11:50 p.m. Monday, said Detective 
Loren Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said the couple had filed for a divorce about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's children, ages 11 and 20, were in the next room when they heard 
the shots, Zimmerman said, and the 20-year-old called police. The children are 
staying with a relative. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the weapon Acosta used in the shootings, a .357 magnum, but it was 
not registered to him, Zimmerman said. Police are trying to find the registered 
owner of the gun to determine why Acosta had it, he said.

FIRM ACCUSED IN HAZARDOUS WASTE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A South Gate chemical firm was charged Tuesday with unlawfully bringing 
hazardous waste into California in what the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office called the first such criminal prosecution in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Stauffer Chemical Co. allegedly transported 10,000 gallons of phosphorus 
waste from Tennessee to the firm's South Gate facility, where it has been 
stored in a railroad tanker car for two years. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all 19 counts of unlawfully transporting, storing and trying to 
dispose of the waste, Stauffer could be fined up to $20 million and ordered to 
pay cleanup costs of $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Phosphorus waste is extremely dangerous because it can ignite if it comes into 
contact with oxygen and will generate heat of up to 6,000 degrees, said William 
Carter, the deputy district attorney handling the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Such a fire would generate toxic smoke and fumes, and would be almost 
impossible to extinguish, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most notorious phosphorus waste fires occurred five years ago in 
Sparks, Nev., when a rail tanker caught fire. The only way to put out the blaze 
was to bury the car, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
At Stauffer's plant in South Gate, employees first tried to eliminate the 
phosphorus waste by burning it. They failed because they could get only a small 
amount out of the tanker and some workers refused to help because of the danger 
involved, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Stauffer manufactured phosphorus at its South Gate facility but has 
since ceased, Carter said. The manufacturing portion of the plant was razed in 
the early 1980s and all that is left on the site now is a distribution and 
sales office. 
</P>
<P>
Stauffer is owned by a French company, Rhone-Poulenc, whose American 
headquarters is in Connecticut. Company officials could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment on the charges is set for Sept. 5 in Los Angeles Municipal Court.

17-YEAR-OLD CHARGED IN DEATHS OF 2 YOUNGSTERS; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: JUVENILE ACCUSED IN SHOTGUN KILLINGS COULD BE SENT TO PRISON FOR LIFE 
UNDER THE RECENTLY APPROVED PROPOSITION 115.

Charges of murder with special circumstances and attempted murder were filed 
Tuesday against a 17-year-old youth accused of firing a shotgun into a weekend 
birthday party in South-Central Los Angeles, killing a 6-year-old girl and 
fatally wounding a 14-year-old boy who died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to seek special circumstances of multiple murder is the first time 
since Proposition 115 was approved in June that a juvenile defendant has been 
charged in Los Angeles County under a provision that calls for life without 
parole upon conviction, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office declined to identify the suspected gunman 
because of his age. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Markus, head of the Compton Hard 
Core anti-gang unit, said authorities will seek to try the youth as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager is scheduled to be arraigned today in Compton Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Before Proposition 115 was approved, a juvenile could not be sentenced to 
prison for life, without possibility of parole, even if convicted in a case 
involving special circumstances, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to the filing of Tuesday's charges unfolded Saturday night 
when a gunman fired two shotgun blasts at party-goers in an apartment at 10500 
S. Vermont Ave., killing Natalie Faine, fatally wounding Tyren Blow and grazing 
the arm of an 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Tyren died Tuesday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center where he had 
been hospitalized with a head wound and placed on a respirator. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the gunman fired two shots toward a second-story balcony 
outside the apartment where Norvelle and Ann Aldridge were celebrating the 
birthdays of several relatives and hit the three children. Natalie had come 
from her home in Pomona to attend the party. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes before the shooting, witnesses said, the gunman had kicked 
Natalie, traded punches with her uncle, Norvelle Aldridge, and had been ordered 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The youth allegedly returned to the home and fired the fatal shots. Police 
arrested him at his nearby home after the shooting.

U.S. OFFICIALS ACCUSE VETERINARIAN OF KILLING SEA LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal wildlife officials have accused a Santa Clarita Valley veterinarian of 
killing a sea lion under his care and are trying to prohibit him from keeping 
or trading in marine mammals in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In a 22-count complaint, authorities also accused Dr. Martin Dinnes of keeping 
at least three sea lions at an unlicensed and substandard facility in a remote 
canyon near Agua Dulce between 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, recently obtained by The Times, alleged that Dinnes violated 
federal law on Aug. 4, 1987, "by killing a California sea lion . . . known as 
Jazzbo or Jaws." It did not explain the circumstances of the death and 
officials refused to elaborate. Nor was it immediately clear why a complaint is 
just now being filed in a case that dates back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a June 1 letter to Dinnes, federal authorities also said they plan to revoke 
his permits and intend to "remove from (his) care and custody" sea lions and 
dolphins listed under those permits and agreements with the government. Dinnes' 
compound, located along Soledad Canyon Road, was not licensed by the National 
Marine Fisheries Service to hold marine mammals and did not meet federal 
standards for such facilities, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dinnes did have permits that allowed him to maintain marine mammals in 
amusement parks and aquatic exhibits across the country, federal officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Tuesday how many animals could be recovered by federal officials 
or where the animals are being kept. Federal authorities said they believe 
Dinnes has animals in various facilities around the country but they have not 
compiled a complete list. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dinnes' employees said he was not available for comment Tuesday because 
he had been called away for a family emergency. His attorney also could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dinnes has been a veterinarian for more than 20 years and has developed a good 
reputation among zoos and in the entertainment industry for treating exotic 
animals, according to those who have worked with him. He has been called the 
"jet-set vet" because of his travels. 
</P>
<P>
Although the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has prosecuted 
violations of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the past, it has rarely 
sought to revoke operating permits, said Patricia Kraniotis, who heads the 
agency's enforcement and litigation section in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed very unusual," Kraniotis said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the agency tries to find civil remedies for problems at marine 
mammal facilities, sometimes because the revocation of a permit creates more 
problems, Kraniotis said. 
</P>
<P>
"You take away a guy's permit, what do you do with the dolphins?" she said. 
"This is a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed June 1 by staff attorneys at the agency's office on 
Terminal Island. Dinnes has until Sept. 5 to request a hearing before an 
administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint provides a bare-bones description of each violation concerning 
six sea lions and five dolphins. Theodore M. Beuttler, a National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration staff attorney at Terminal Island, declined to 
elaborate on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said Dinnes violated federal law by failing to file autopsy 
reports with the National Marine Fisheries Service within 30 days of the deaths 
of four sea lions. Jaws died in 1987. The other animals died between 1986 and 
1989. Another sea lion was transferred by Dinnes to someone who did not have a 
permit to display a marine mammal, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
Dinnes also failed to file reports on five dolphins that died between 1986 and 
1987, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
According to so-called "inventory" reports filed with the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration by Dinnes, the dolphins died from a variety of 
ailments, including viral pneumonia and intestinal obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
The reports did not list a cause of death for Jaws. The other sea lions died of 
such ailments as heat stroke and emphysema.

ABDUCTION LEAVES WOMAN IN A COMA; POLICE HUNT 2 MEN;

CRIME: VICTIM WAS DRAGGED INTO A TRUCK BY SUSPECTS. SHE SUFFERED HEAD INJURIES 
WHEN SHE EITHER FELL OR WAS THROWN FROM THE MOVING VEHICLE.

A young woman who went out for a night of dancing with friends was in a coma 
Tuesday as police sought two men who abducted her outside a disco and may have 
thrown her from a moving truck. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Eickholdt, 19, of Compton, suffered major head injuries when she struck 
the pavement about one block from Mr. J's disco at 10478 Valley Boulevard in El 
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Several disco patrons witnessed the attack early Monday morning, El Monte 
Police Detective Butch Reyburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and sheriff's homicide investigators asked for the public's help in 
locating two Latino men, each about 20, who abducted Eickholdt on Esto Street 
near the disco. 
</P>
<P>
Eickholdt, who lives with her mother, stepfather and several siblings, had come 
to the disco with friends, police said. After the club closed at 2 a.m., she 
became separated from her companions. She was walking on nearby Esto Street, 
searching for her friends, when she was accosted by two men, witnesses told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men, Reyburn said, dragged the young woman "half in and half out" of 
the passenger door of the truck while the other drove the vehicle away at high 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
After traveling about a block, the man holding Eickholdt "either threw her to 
the ground, or she struggled and broke loose from his grip," Reyburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics took Eickholdt to Greater El Monte Community Hospital, where she was 
in critical condition. She has been in a coma since her arrival, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the two men being sought may have been among the 300 patrons 
at the disco that night. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the truck as a 1964-1966 Chevrolet stepside pickup painted 
in a gray primer with a black left front fender. It bore an older California 
license plate with yellow letters and numbers on a black background. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators asked that anyone who has information about the incident or the 
truck contact El Monte police at (818) 580-2100 or the sheriff's homicide 
investigators at (213) 974-4341.

BASE HELPS THOSE LEFT IN WAKE OF MIDEAST CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the sudden mobilization for the Middle East crisis, Camp Pendleton is 
working swiftly to help military families left behind to cope with their 
emotional and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
A network of support groups has been set up for wives of Marines, making sure 
no families go without enough food, and striving to help children understand 
why their father has abruptly left. 
</P>
<P>
A special workbook for children, "Daddy's Days Away," featuring a 
camouflage-colored cover, is being circulated. The book explains that the 
father is away defending the country and urges children to talk about their 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with emotions is one of the main purposes of support groups being 
created by the base's Family Service Center. The Armed Services YMCA has 
already set up a family center on base for wives anxious to hear of their 
husbands' whereabouts and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Since Marines usually know six months in advance about a normal deployment, the 
quick departure of Marines late last week -- the exact number of troops sent to 
the Middle East hasn't been disclosed -- stunned many families. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some high emotions there," said Dianne Riddick, deployment 
coordinator for the Family Service Center. Still, she's impressed with how 
strong Marine wives are in dealing with their husbands' potentially dangerous 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I really encourage them to try not to worry too much, they can't change the 
situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But besides helping wives cope with anxiety and the pressure of running a 
household alone, the Family Service Center, the Red Cross and the Navy Relief 
Society are also offering assistance for a variety of practical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some families, especially those of lower enlisted men, are suffering financial 
hardships. Often, the monthly food allowance for Marines is suspended when they 
go on campaign, and although the money is intended for the Marine, the funds 
are typically used to help feed dependents. 
</P>
<P>
Roxann Bronson of the Navy Relief Society, said, "We definitely will not allow 
anybody to go hungry." The society offers bags of food plus grants and 
no-interest loans to struggling families. 
</P>
<P>
A 73-page survival booklet given out by the Center offers wives advice on 
everything from where to find activities, how to place an overseas telephone 
call and how to keep a household budget. 
</P>
<P>
It also outlines the four basic emotional stages of separation -- protest 
against the deployment, despair, detachment, and the return adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton's deployment program is five years old. Riddick wishes something 
like it existed back during the Vietnam War, when her husband served in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
"When Walt went to Vietnam, there was nothing," she said.

RADKE GUILTY IN SLAYING OF MIRA MESA TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court jury convicted Mark Alan Radke on Tuesday of 
first-degree murder in the brutal 1988 killing of a Mira Mesa teen-ager but 
could not fully resolve the case by deciding whether Radke -- or a mystery 
accomplice -- wielded the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Radke guilty of murder in the death of 16-year-old Jeffrey 
Rudiger, whose beaten body was found in a Scripps Ranch alley in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the verdict, Judge J. Richard Haden sent Radke to San Diego 
County Jail, revoking $200,000 bail. Radke could draw 25 years to life in 
prison when he is sentenced Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The jury could not, however, reach a decision on a second count that alleged 
that Radke used a deadly weapon in the killing. That meant at least some jurors 
believed a second person may have hit Rudiger repeatedly with the weapon, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel G. Lamborn said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the beginning of the case was delayed for months with legal 
maneuvering over whether most of the evidence was legally obtained, prosecutors 
first mentioned the possibility of an accomplice when the trial began late last 
month. No other person has been implicated in the killing and the chances of 
finding that second person are remote, Lamborn said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudiger's family, however, expressed a measure of relief at the verdict. 
Jeffrey Rudiger's sister, Kelly, who has served as the family's spokeswoman, 
exclaimed, "Yes!" as the murder verdict was read, then sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
Hurriedly walking out of the courtroom, however, Kelly Rudiger said she was not 
yet satisfied. "Not until sentencing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Radke appeared impassive as the jury's verdict was read and as he was led away 
by marshals. His father said he believes his son is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"I never will change my mind," Elmer Radke said. "That's all I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Douglas C. Brown promised an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury apparently found that Mr. Radke did not wield the weapon in this 
particular case, so I question how they could find him guilty of the murder, 
especially a brutal murder like this, without a finding that he used the 
weapon," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also said that though Radke appeared dispassionate, he was upset at the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"He was aware he could have been convicted," Brown said. "Both of us are aware 
there are a lot of battles left to be fought on this one. He hasn't given up 
hope, is a better way to put it." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were escorted out the back door of the courtroom and were not available 
for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Rudiger, a junior at Mira Mesa High School, disappeared after work on 
the night of Jan. 21, 1988. His body was found the next day near a Scripps 
Ranch commercial center, dressed only in underwear and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Rudiger was wearing handcuffs, had been bludgeoned on the head with a blunt 
object and had cuts on his body. Brown said at the trial that it appeared 
Rudiger was hit 26 times with a tire iron or similar object. 
</P>
<P>
Radke, now 24, was arrested after Rudiger's friends told police that he and 
Radke were working together on a secret project. Radke and Rudiger both worked 
at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Scripps Ranch, near where Rudiger's body was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Before the case made it to trial, it generated three separate appeals over 
whether police had acted properly in detaining Radke for questioning after a 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a state appellate court ruled that police were overzealous and 
violated Radke's constitutional rights by placing him in handcuffs and by 
drawing a revolver. That decision appeared to make virtually all evidence in 
the case off limits to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
But last September, San Diego Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes said officers 
had probable cause -- or a "strong suspicion" -- to arrest Radke before they 
ever saw him. A state appellate court upheld that decision in January, meaning 
all the evidence that officers later found was obtained legally. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial, Brown contended that police took footprints at the scene and, 
when they compared the prints to Radke's sneakers, found they were not his 
size. 
</P>
<P>
Two bloody knives found at the scene have not been linked to Radke or anyone 
else, and no fingerprints could be taken off them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lamborn said blood spots that matched Rudiger's blood type were found in 
Radke's car trunk, in the wheel wells of his recently cleaned car and on his 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Rudiger's body had been dragged twice -- once a distance of 
70 to 80 feet, and again about 13 feet. He also said it had been dragged by two 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Lamborn said blood spattering indicated one person held Rudiger's legs while 
another held his head. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony, Rudiger told friends he had received wine coolers for 
taking part in the first phase of the purported project. But in an interview 
with police that was taped and played at the trial, Radke said he knew nothing 
about a "project" or "mission." 
</P>
<P>
Lamborn said after the verdict that a motive -- like so many other aspects of 
the case -- remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Radke "had a secret. I don't know what the secret is," Lamborn said. "He wanted 
to keep it fatally secret and he did it by killing Jeffrey Rudiger."

DOCTORS' GROUP HOPES TO CURE ILLS OF AILING HOSPITAL IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors at Burbank Community Hospital may oversee the board room as well as the 
examining room as a result of a lease agreement reached this week with the 
nonprofit foundation that owns the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to reverse three years of financial losses at the hospital, a 
partnership of 19 doctors agreed Monday to lease the facility and operate it by 
installing its own board of directors if the physicians can raise enough money. 
</P>
<P>
The lease agreement -- approved Monday by hospital staff members and trustees 
of the Burbank Community Hospital Foundation by a 35-9 vote, with three 
abstentions -- is part of a new financial strategy that will include an 
increased emphasis on outpatient care, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a transition," hospital Administrator William Daniel said. "We want 
to take advantage of our small size and our location in the community" by 
increasing the proportion of hospital business devoted to outpatients, who 
provide the hospital with higher profits, from 25% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be more of a medical mall," said William Swanson, a family practitioner 
and treasurer of the physicians' partnership, called Doctors Hospital of 
Burbank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to change the identity of the hospital," Swanson said, adding that 
the doctors might add new facilities, such as a medical supplies shop. "The 
inpatient population will be less important in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The lease will not take effect until the physicians' group raises between 
$600,000 and $700,000, half the amount the hospital foundation believes will 
ultimately be needed, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
The group needs about two months to increase its size to about 50 partners, 
each of whom will contribute between $10,000 and $20,000 to the lease fund, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians' partnership will allow any of the approximately 150 doctors 
entitled to practice at Burbank to invest in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership will try to attract a balance of physicians from various 
medical specialties, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors are discussing whether to change the name of the hospital and 
whether the physicians' group will operate on a nonprofit basis, Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some members of the hospital staff grew frustrated with the length of 
the negotiations, there is "an upbeat mood now," Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Community Hospital is licensed to operate 105 beds, but because of low 
demand has only 65 prepared for use, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, only about half are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's falling revenues over the past three years are due partly to 
general medical trends, such as shorter periods of patient hospitalization and 
increased cost-consciousness by insurance companies, Daniels said.

Also, nearby St. Joseph Medical Center provides continuing competition, and a 
1987 investigation by the county health department into the deaths of five 
indigent patients gave Burbank Community Hospital a poor reputation. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges were filed, but "the publicity severely damaged the 
hospital and further decreased its utilization, which has hastened the day we 
need to take it over," Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation dealt with doctors who no longer work at the hospital, 
Swanson stressed. 
</P>
<P>
But the physicians who will lease it hope that by assuming control of hospital 
policy themselves, they will expedite decision-making and further improve 
patient care, he said.

OFFICIALS ARGUE OVER TRAFFIC JAM'S CAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: CALTRANS AND THE CITY BLAME EACH OTHER FOR A DEBACLE THAT 
OCCURRED SATURDAY WHEN THEY DID ROADWORK AT THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME AREA.

City and state traffic officials acted decidedly non-collegial Tuesday as they 
traded barbs over the cause of a giant traffic jam that tied up the Ventura 
Freeway as well as surface streets in Sherman Oaks and Encino for several hours 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed that the tie-up was caused by motorists detoured off the 
Ventura Freeway by lane and ramp closures that are part of a widening project. 
But city officials said they were not adequately notified of the closures, 
which were scheduled for the same time as repair work at Sepulveda and Ventura 
boulevards that added to motorists' woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't adequately notified" by Caltrans of the freeway closures, said Guy 
Quinn, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles city Department of 
Transportation. "They told us about the closures but not the extent of it." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans also failed to notify the city that motorists would be directed to use 
Ventura Boulevard as an alternative route, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city was adequately notified," said Pat Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman. She 
said a Caltrans engineer gave the city a detailed explanation of the agency's 
road closure and detour plans. "This was a routine contact with DOT. It was 
done just like it's been done before, for weeks," Reid said. "We have no 
further comment." 
</P>
<P>
The traffic jam clogged streets for miles at midday. Traffic snarled major 
east-west streets between Reseda and Van Nuys boulevards and north-south 
streets between Victory and Ventura boulevards, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Diverting traffic off the Ventura Freeway were lane and ramp closures that are 
part of a $76-million project to widen the roadway between Agoura Hills and 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
The worst congestion occurred at Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards, where a 
private contractor was digging a trench for the city's Automated Traffic 
Surveillance and Control system. The contractor, Steiny &amp; Co., was allowed 
to close one lane of the boulevard in each direction, Quinn said. Ventura 
Boulevard has six through-traffic lanes and two left-turn lanes at that 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said the contractor closed only the number of lanes allowed. "There's no 
way that little work caused that tie-up," Quinn said. "It wasn't us." 
</P>
<P>
City traffic crews, which use the computerized control system in City Hall to 
detect traffic jams and alter signal operations in response, watched the jam-up 
develop Saturday, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"They dealt with it as best they could," he said. But no amount of signal 
manipulation could ease the movement of two lanes of freeway traffic being 
diverted onto city streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Saturday's problem, Quinn vowed that a similar mix-up "won't happen 
again. We're going to be a lot more cautious in the future."

A 36-year-old man was shot and killed by robbers at a house reputedly used as a 
headquarters to buy and sell drugs, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lazaro Medina of National City died at San Diego General Hospital shortly after 
10:30 p.m. Monday, said Deputy Coroner Chuck Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
Three friends brought Medina to the hospital, and each man reportedly offered a 
different explanation of what had happened to Medina, who died from a single 
gunshot wound to the stomach, San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing witnesses, detectives determined that Medina had been at a 
house frequented by drug dealers in the 2600 block of C Street, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Medina was reportedly shot during an attempt to rob him of drugs and money, 
Robinson said.

One man was killed and another was injured during two separate but possibly 
related attacks near a city park Monday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The slain man, identified by the coroner's office as Andres de la Cruz 
Casillas, 28, died of stab wounds at the UC San Diego Medical Center shortly 
after 7:30 p.m., police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Casillas was attacked at Memorial Park, a recreation area at 30th Street and 
Ocean View Boulevard, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"A second stabbing victim was admitted to San Diego General Hospital at about 
the same time," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
That victim, whose identity was not released, had also been attacked in the 
vicinity of the park, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the stabbings are connected, and an investigation into both 
cases is continuing, Robinson said.

NEW CENTER FOR ABUSED CHILDREN RECEIVES $1-MILLION STATE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County and a private child abuse agency received $1 million from the 
state for construction of a new center for abused children, officials announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The grant was awarded after county officials and the Child Abuse Prevention 
Foundation submitted a joint proposal for funding through Proposition 86, the 
County Correctional Facility Capital Expenditure &amp; Youth Facility Bond Act, 
passed by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to R. Barry McComic, who heads the foundation's fund-raising efforts, 
the planned Children's Center will cost about $15 million and will open in two 
years. McComic and foundation director Jennifer Vanica said their next goal is 
to find a donor willing to contribute $5 million for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The center will replace the 26-year-old Hillcrest Receiving Home, the county 
shelter for abused and neglected children. Supervisors Susan Golding and Brian 
Bilbray, who worked closely with the foundation to obtain the state grant, said 
the aging shelter can no longer meet the needs of abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Hillcrest only has 22 beds and admits more than 500 children every month, 
county officials said. The new center will have 130 beds. 
</P>
<P>
"The 130-bed emergency shelter will be a comprehensive child abuse prevention 
and treatment center. . . . It is urgently needed," Vanica said. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said the new facility will fill a sad, but much needed function in 
today's society. She added that the number of child abuse cases is growing in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some place to house children who need to be taken from their parents. 
. . . An abused child usually grows up to be a child abuser," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray praised the joint effort as a shining example of how the private and 
public sectors can work together without being prompted by political necessity 
or expediency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a traditional social issue," Bilbray said. "It shows that we don't 
have to be driven by political necessity." 
</P>
<P>
He called the grant proposal put together by the county and foundation a 
"package that shined in Sacramento." It was an "aggressive proposal that 
overwhelmed the review process," he added. 
</P>
<P>
However, Golding noted that more money is needed to complete the center. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope there's a donor somewhere . . . who would like to contribute a $5 
million grant," Golding said. "It's a critical facility, a place to show how 
abused children can be taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides said they hope private contributions will help with 
construction costs, McComic said some of the financing will probably have to 
come from bonds issued by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The county has selected a 10-acre site, on Ruffin Road near the County 
Operations Center, for the home.

A 31-year-old woman was killed Tuesday when the car in which she was riding 
stalled on California 94, then burst into flames when it was rear-ended by two 
other cars, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalina Vargas Cegueda of San Diego, an employee of a National City dress 
store, was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after 7 a.m., Deputy Coroner 
Chuck Bolton said . 
</P>
<P>
Cegueda was riding in rush-hour traffic with Antonio Maganda, 28, also of San 
Diego, when Maganda's car stalled in the eastbound lanes of the freeway east of 
25th Street, a California Highway Patrol dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Maganda was able to get out of the car, while Cegueda remained seated in the 
front passenger seat, the dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
An approaching car struck the disabled vehicle, sending it spinning into the 
freeway median, where a second car smashed into it, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the first car that hit the disabled car was unhurt; the driver of 
the other car suffered minor injuries.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REMNANTS OF PCP LAB FOUND NEAR DIRT ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County health officials Tuesday cleaned up equipment from an 
illegal drug lab found in a remote canyon in Val Verde, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the size of the containers found near a dirt road off Hasley Canyon 
Road, deputies estimated that 35 gallons of the drug PCP, with a street value 
of up to $5 million, could have been manufactured with the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous trash cans and empty ether cans were found about 7:30 p.m. Monday by 
two deputies looking for abandoned cars. They smelled ether and traced it to a 
small clearing. 
</P>
<P>
A narcotics investigator said it was unclear whether the PCP was manufactured 
there or whether the materials had been dumped. 
</P>
<P>
No PCP was found, but a highly flammable chemical residue left after 
manufacture of the drug was still in the containers. The deputies called a Fire 
Department hazardous materials unit and health officials to remove the 
materials.

WAREHOUSE WORKERS CARRY PROTEST TO DISNEY'S HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

About 25 warehouse workers demonstrated in front of the North Hollywood 
residence of Roy Disney Tuesday, demanding that he order one of his subsidiary 
companies to negotiate with employees over wages and union representation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being ripped off," said Susana Menendez, a Show Industries/Music Plus 
worker who marched in front of the house on Arcola Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"They think because we're Latino that they can do anything to us." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered the bell at the Disney residence and representatives of Show 
Industries could not be reached for for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Warehouse workers at Show Industries/Music plus voted overwhelmingly in 
November to have Teamsters Union Local 598 represent them in negotiating a 
labor contract, said Carrie Biggs-Adams, a labor union consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But the company appealed the vote to the National Labor Relations Board, an 
effort to stall talks over wages and health benefits, demonstrators contended. 
Many of the protesters work for the federal minimum wage and the majority of 
the 200 warehouse workers are Latino, Biggs-Adams said. Union officials said 
Disney is the chairman of the board of Shamrock Holdings, which owns Show 
Industries/Music Plus. "We want him to instruct his subsidiary to sit down and 
start bargaining," Biggs-Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
As protesters cheered and whistled, Menendez used a baseball bat to burst a 
brightly colored Mickey Mouse pinata that dangled from a tree in front of the 
Disney residence. Pennies and Mickey Mouse Band-Aids spilled onto the concrete, 
"symbolic of the bad medical care and the low pay," Carrie said.

EARLY ANNEXATION OK MAY BE ILLEGAL; 
</P>
<P>
JORDAN RANCH: SIMI VALLEY MIGHT HAVE TO FINISH AN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY BEFORE 
PLANNING AGENCY CAN ACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Ventura County planning agency might break the law if it gives preliminary 
approval to Simi Valley to annex Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch without reviewing an 
extensive environmental study first, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several state court cases dictate that cities must complete an environmental 
impact report before area commissions can act on annexation requests, Bradbury 
said. He is investigating whether a tentative ruling would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Agency Formation Commission is scheduled to discuss the annexation at 
its Sept. 12 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Trower, an assistant Ventura County counsel and legal adviser to LAFCO, 
said he also questions the legality of a tentative ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a good possibility they are not going to be able to vote on the 
request without an environmental impact report," Trower said. 
</P>
<P>
Hope has offered 5,700 acres of parkland in exchange for an access road to a 
planned subdivision. He asked Simi Valley officials to annex his ranch because 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors has indicated that it would not approve 
the project, which is now under its jurisdiction. Simi Valley Mayor Greg 
Stratton said the city is prepared to conduct the necessary environmental 
studies before annexing the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that they would require some kind of study," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, a member of LAFCO, said if the 
city is forced to study the issue first, it would defeat the purpose of 
requesting the preliminary ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials voted July 30 to ask LAFCO to make an early determination 
on whether the area could be annexed so the city would not waste money on a 
study if there is no chance of LAFCO approval. 
</P>
<P>
Even if LAFCO were to grant preliminary approval, the agency would still be 
required to take a final vote on the request after lengthy city review. 
</P>
<P>
Hope has proposed building a 750-house subdivision. Spokesmen for Hope have 
said his offer to turn over 5,700 acres of parkland to the National Park 
Service, in exchange for an access road to Jordan Ranch and $10 million, hinges 
on government approval of the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Hope has asked Simi Valley to annex not only Jordan Ranch south of the city but 
3,945 acres of Runkle Ranch to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials declined to disclose whether they will eventually 
support or oppose annexation of the land, they have agreed to consider the 
proposal. Some officials are concerned that if they are unable to annex the 
Hope properties, Blind Canyon, part of Runkle Ranch, will be sold to the Los 
Angeles County Sanitation Districts and be turned into a landfill.

DAVE DISTEL: FOR SURGING PADRES, SHOW'S TIME IS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Larry Mendte can write about sports, I suppose it's only fair that I write 
about the weather. 
</P>
<P>
You see, I know what brought those dark clouds and drizzling weather to town. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show. 
</P>
<P>
The man seems to have spent most of his baseball career with his own personal 
dark cloud over his head. In this dreariest of years, his cloud has grown large 
and dark enough to cover an entire county. 
</P>
<P>
That, Larry, was what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show came home. 
</P>
<P>
I make this point because of his unbelievable outburst the other day in 
Houston. In short, he made it rather clear that he no longer cares to be 
employed by the Padres. He demanded to be traded or released and did everything 
but threaten to jump off the Coronado Bridge if he is not accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
You want excerpts? Buckle up . . . 
</P>
<P>
On respect: "There's been a lot of back-stabbing, talking behind my back, and 
I'm really tired of it all . . . I can't demand preferential treatment, but 
basically the message that's been sent to me is that they don't believe in me. 
I'm being systematically ignored." 
</P>
<P>
On his contract: "The Padres essentially lied about the contract. They never 
followed up on their option like they said they would." 
</P>
<P>
On baseball in general: "The thing that really bothers me the most is that you 
appear to be the recipient of what appears to be that the entire internal 
baseball management hierarchy is dominated and perpetuated by fear." 
</P>
<P>
Come again? 
</P>
<P>
On Pat Dobson, the pitching coach: "He has the ability to turn very quickly. 
This is a watch-out-for-yourself syndrome. He's not one you can trust very 
much." 
</P>
<P>
On his relationship with Dobson: "Manic depressive." 
</P>
<P>
All of this (and much more) came in the aftermath of not being asked to start 
Sunday's game against the Astros. He took this as being a slight of substantial 
proportion. Indeed, he called it the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
The man who did start, Derek Lilliquist, went out and threw a four-hitter to 
win, 9-0. This would not seem to be a sensible occasion on which to be 
second-guessing the manager's selection of pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Show chose the occasion of the last day of the most successful trip in 
the history of the franchise to vent his discontent. He chose a time when 
things finally seem to be falling in place for this heretofore struggling club, 
a time when there is at least a glimmer of hope that maybe this club can get 
back into the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, this was a rather selfish time to verbalize personal frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
What he said and when he said it made it perfectly clear he no longer feels a 
part of the team and thus no longer feels compelled to concern himself with 
team chemistry. Eric Show would concern himself with Eric Show, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the solution is to get rid of him . . . ASAP. 
</P>
<P>
However, that is much more easily said than done. 
</P>
<P>
Who wants him? 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, the vice-president/baseball operations, has been trying to find a 
taker. 
</P>
<P>
Any luck, Jack? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "Not at all." 
</P>
<P>
Show, you see, has four wins and eight losses and an earned-run average of 
6.25. All of this has come in a year following back surgery, which in itself 
would be a bit of a deterrent. It is also a possibility that other clubs might 
perceive him as being a malcontent as well. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Show is about as valuable as an airplane ticket to Baghdad. You 
might have to trade him for a player to be born later. 
</P>
<P>
So what do you do? 
</P>
<P>
"You just gotta stick with him," McKeon said. "Maybe somebody will get antsy 
about needing a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Patience, then, is McKeon's choice of options. 
</P>
<P>
My choice would be to release him. Say goodby. Adios. 
</P>
<P>
This option might be dangerous and maybe even a little stupid, but Eric Show 
could turn around and win the Cy Young Award, and the Padres would never be 
second-guessed for turning him loose. Ask the fans to give him a thumbs up or a 
thumbs down, and you know how that vote would go. 
</P>
<P>
Simply stated, Eric Show's days as a Padre are over. 
</P>
<P>
Turn him loose. I'm ready for sunshine already.

CHARGERS TELL SEAU 'NO' AGAIN

The agent for Junior Seau, the Chargers' first-round draft choice, said he 
thought the Chargers had drawn a line in the sand they would not cross. 
</P>
<P>
That line was the reported five-year, $6-million contract the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers had awarded linebacker Keith McCants, the player taken one spot 
ahead of Seau in the NFL draft. Get below that, he thought, and the Chargers 
would get serious. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Feldman of Newport Beach said he thought he had crossed onto the 
Chargers' side Tuesday, only to find they had moved the line. And he said he 
doesn't know where it is. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard rejected his offer of $1 
less than the deal signed by McCants, saying he had to come "considerably" 
below the average $1.2 million per year McCants will receive. 
</P>
<P>
"It turns out when they said we have to come in under Keith McCants, they left 
out a word," Feldman said. "That was 'considerably,' and at this point, we just 
can't accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said he was surprised and upset that Beathard did not make a counter 
offer during the 40-minute meeting "because we agreed to do what they said." 
</P>
<P>
But Beathard said he was sorry if recent statements misled Feldman and Seau to 
think that if they made an offer just under McCants' contract, a deal could be 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't mean a penny or a dollar," Beathard said. "But I didn't say 
the word 'considerably.' So if there is a misunderstanding, I take the blame 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
The late afternoon meeting at the team's UC San Diego training camp, also 
attended by Seau, was the first discussion between the parties since a week 
ago, when Feldman proposed a four-year deal averaging $1.35 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
But Beathard said Tuesday was not the right time for the Chargers to make a 
counter offer or reveal the figure at which they might settle. The Chargers 
have not made an offer since proposing a five-year deal averaging about 
$850,000 per year 2 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When we feel it is appropriate to make our offer, we think it is a very fair 
figure," Beathard said. "But right now, we don't think it would have helped our 
position or made any difference doing it." 
</P>
<P>
But Seau said he thinks it would help talks if the team would reveal its best 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their set figure, and they're not letting it out," Seau said. "I 
want to know. We can't even judge on anything until they give us their figure. 
</P>
<P>
"If they would come out and say, 'This is all we're going to give you,' then we 
have something to work with. Now we don't we don't have anything to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Seau said the meeting gave him further reason to believe that his contract 
holdout, which today enters its 27th day, could go on considerably longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally can grasp that it is going to be longer than I expected," Seau said. 
"I'm upset because I miss football. It is pretty sad the business is the way it 
is. I didn't make the market. I know I'm not going to break the market with the 
contract I get. I just want a fair contract and let me be Junior Seau." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Seau said he would continue to work out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is train and dream about the day I get in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard also said a meeting with holdout linebacker Leslie O'Neal was canceled 
Tuesday and rescheduled for this morning and that he plans to meet later today 
with O'Neal's agent, Marvin Demoff of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal is the only Charger veteran still unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers concluded two days of practices with the Dallas Cowboys Tuesday. 
The Cowboys will continue to train at UC San Diego in preparation for an 
exhibition game Saturday against the Raiders, but the teams will not practice 
against each other again. . . . Coach Dan Henning said he probably will start 
Billy Joe Tolliver at quarterback in Saturday night's exhibition against the 
Rams at Anaheim Stadium. He said the plan would be for Tolliver to play about a 
half, with Mark Vlasic and Friesz splitting the rest. . . . Henning said he has 
not heard the results of his team's drug tests from the NFL but that he does 
not expect there to be any positive tests. The NFL announced Monday that it had 
suspended two players after they tested positive for steroids. . . . J.J. 
Flannigan, the eighth-round draft choice from Colorado, was released Tuesday 
morning, leaving the Chargers one under the NFL limit of 80 active signed 
players.

HOME FANS DON'T GET PADRES' RECENT SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THEY CAN'T SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT AS TEAM RETURNS HOME FROM 
9-2 TRIP AND LOSES TO MONTREAL, 8-3. 
</P>

<P>
Returning from the most successful road trip in their 22-year history, the 
Padres stumbled to a disappointing, 8-3 loss to the Montreal Expos Tuesday at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Coming after the 9-2 trip, the loss in front of 15,855 fans snapped the Padres' 
four-game winning streak. It also evened Manager Greg Riddoch's record at 17-17 
since he took over July 11. 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of what kind of year it has been and night it was it was, the 
Padres used three-fifths of their season-opening starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen started and was ripped for five hits and five runs in 3 2/3 
innings. He fell to 8-11 with a 4.64 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show, the Padres' all-time victory leader who said Sunday that he wanted 
to be traded, was next. Show, just 4-8 this year and relegated to the bullpen 
probably for the rest of the season, pitched decently but was not overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes, who missed a start Sunday to attend to family matters, came on in 
the eighth in his first career appearance as a reliever. He started well, 
retiring the side in the inning, but then gave up three runs on two hits and 
two walks in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal, meanwhile, was winning its sixth in a row, and Dennis Martinez was 
cruising to his 9th victory in 17 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez allowed just five hits, four in the first two innings. After that, he 
retired 17 in a row and 22 of the last 23. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the scoring occurred in the first 3 1/2 innings, and the source of most 
of the damage was an improbable one. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Nixon, Montreal's No. 2 hitter, greeted Rasmussen in the first inning with 
a line drive home run over the auxiliary fence in left field. 
</P>
<P>
What's so unusual about a home run, especially off Rasmussen, who has now 
yielded 16, the second highest on the team? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Nixon had not hit a home run in nearly five years. His last came Sept. 
4, 1985, in Toronto, when he played for Cleveland. This one, on a 2-2 pitch, 
was his first National League homer and just the fourth of his six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
It was so rare that the Expo pre-game press notes stated: "Otis Nixon is vying 
to become the first-ever member of the exclusive 30-0 club (30 stolen bases 
combined with no home runs) three years in a row." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't make it. But it turned out to be a memorable night anyway as Nixon, a 
switch-hitting center fielder, finished four for four with a walk, four runs 
batted in and a stolen base to give him a team-leading 36. 
</P>
<P>
It was Nixon's first four-hit, four-RBI game. Entering the game, he was hitting 
just .239 with 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 1-0, the Padres rebounded for three runs in the bottom of the second. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago singled to center to get the rally going. It came on the first 
pitch Santiago has seen in the stadium in exactly two months. On June 14, 
Santiago suffered a broken left forearm here on a pitch by San Francisco's Jeff 
Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning Friday at Houston, Santiago has gone four for 14 with three 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
After Phil Stephenson grounded out to third, Mike Pagliarulo appeared to have 
done the same to shortstop, but normally reliable Spike Owen threw low to 
first, and Andres Galarraga was unable to scoop it. 
</P>
<P>
For Owen, who led all National League shortstops in 1989 with a .979 fielding 
percentage and set a National League record by going 63 games without an error 
earlier this year, it was only his fourth error and just the fifth by an Expo 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Now with first and third occupied, Garry Templeton lined a single to right, 
driving in Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
After Rasmussen struck out attempting a sacrifice, Bip Roberts hit his second 
double of the game -- he doubled to lead off the Padres' first -- to drive in 
Pagliarulo and Templeton. Montreal made another throwing error -- this time it 
was second baseman Delino DeShields on Roberto Alomar's grounder -- to keep 
alive the inning, but Tony Gwynn grounded out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
DeShields made up for his miscue immediately by leading off the top of the 
third with a triple down the right-field line. Nixon drove him in with a single 
to center to cut the Padres' lead to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, the Expos got three runs on three hits and drove Rasmussen from 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Galarraga walked. Marquis Grissom singled. Mike Fitzgerald singled, driving in 
Galarraga with the tying run. Owen's grounder to second drove in Grissom, 
giving the Expos a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Denny Martinez grounded out to first and DeShields walked, Riddoch had 
seen enough of Rasmussen. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Show, who was wildly booed upon being introduced, then booed again when 
he allowed a single up the middle to Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Show allowed just one more hit and was the most effective Padre 
pitcher on the night. 
</P>
<P>
The reception Show received, of course, had something to do with the way he 
lambasted the Padres' organization Sunday, especially pitching coach Pat 
Dobson. 
</P>
<P>
"There's two points I want to make," he said afterward. "First, it was an off 
day, and I should have realized it was an off day, and there would be nothing 
to write about. Second, the way (Dobson) appeared to be manipulated by some 
questions or made the mistake of thinking I blamed something on Dobson, there's 
no way I'm going to blame my problems on anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I said was true. To say I didn't mean it would be a lie, but I 
wasn't looking to go to battle with anyone. . . . People have said it before. 
Maybe the best thing for me is to pitch somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark, who missed all three games in Houston over the weekend because of a 
sore right hamstring, was scratched from Tuesday's starting lineup after 
reporting a slight twinge to Manager Greg Riddoch. Riddoch said Clark's status 
is day-to-day, but he could be used as a pinch-hitter. "He's doing more each 
day," Riddoch said. "He took ground balls as well as batting practice today. I 
would rather be safe than sorry. I would rather make sure we have him for the 
last five or six weeks (of the season) than use him early and risk anything 
happening." . . . Benito Santiago said he's feeling fine since returning Friday 
against Houston after 56 days out because of a broken left forearm. "He's 
great," Riddoch said. "In fact, I talked to him during infield and said, 'Hey, 
you look strong.' He said, 'I am.' He said, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't I 
let you know if I'm starting to feel tired.' He's the most durable catcher I 
think I've ever seen in professional baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes, who flew back to San Diego and missed his scheduled start Sunday at 
Houston because of family matters, re-joined the club Tuesday. Benes is 
scheduled to pitch Saturday against Philadelphia. Riddoch and Pat Dobson, the 
pitching coach, said they would like to give Benes a couple innings of relief 
work either today or Thursday. . . . A number of Padres have hit Montreal's 
pitchers well this season. After five games entering Tuesday's, Mike Pagliarulo 
was hitting .375, Tony Gwynn .368, Bip Roberts and Shawn Abner .333 and Roberto 
Alomar .316. Strangely, Garry Templeton, who was one for 17, had the Padres 
only home run, and no Padre had more than two runs batted in. . . . The Expos, 
who led the National League in stolen bases last year with 160, already have a 
league-leading 170 this year. They are also the only major league team with 
three players with 30 or more steals. Otis Nixon and Tim Raines had 35 entering 
Tuesday's game, Delino DeShields 32.

TIME TO SEE IF AZTECS TOOK OFF-SEASON OFF; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: COACH AL LUGINBILL SAYS SDSU'S SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON THE CONDITION 
OF HIS VETERAN PLAYERS. HE FINDS OUT WHAT SHAPE THEY'RE IN TODAY, WHEN 
RETURNEES CHECK IN TO TRAINING CAMP FOR PHYSICAL EXAMS. TWO-A-DAY PRACTICES 
START THURSDAY.

<P>
There will be no cheerleaders yelling, no band marching, no television cameras 
whirring, and yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
Al Luginbill, San Diego State football coach, is calling today the most 
important day of the Aztec football season. And practice hasn't even started 
yet, let alone games. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Luginbill is serious. Today is reporting day, a day on which the 
Aztecs check into their dormitory rooms, take physicals and get set to open 
two-a-day practices Thursday morning. Luginbill will be there to greet them, 
giving them the once-over to see how hard they worked during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole progress will depend on how well our veterans report in shape," 
Luginbill said. "That's the key to us. Wednesday will be the biggest day we'll 
have in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to spend so much time on conditioning, that's going to take away 
from the football part, and that will hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen and newcomers have been working out since Friday. But Thursday will be 
the first day the entire team practices together, and Sunday is the first in 
pads. A total of 31 lettermen return from last year's 6-5-1 team, including six 
offensive starters and eight defensive. 
</P>
<P>
Not much has changed since spring practice. Aside from the freshmen and 
transfers who join the team this fall, there have been no significant additions 
or subtractions, and Luginbill will continue to focus on strengthening the 
Aztec defense and improving an already potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We take the first two weeks of fall practice, and we're preparing for a whole 
season -- 11 games," Luginbill said. "We have the same goals we talked about 
during the spring. On defense, we've got to keep the football in front of us 
and make plays in space. On offense, we've got to become a consistent football 
team that consistently moves the chains. 
</P>
<P>
"Those goals will remain the same for the entire season. Then, in the last 
week-and-a-half, we'll zero in on Oregon and be ready to play on Sept. 8." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs open in Eugene that day and then return for their home opener Sept. 
15 against Cal State Long Beach. The following week, they begin Western 
Athletic Conference play at Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Luginbill hopes the Aztec defense will be tighter than it was last 
season, when it gave up 65 plays on which the opponent gained 20 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what made us the defensive football team we were," Luginbill said. "We 
didn't keep the football in front of us. And yet, there were times when we were 
extremely successful. We know we can do it. We just have to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Two areas that will get Luginbill's attention during the next three weeks are 
linebacker and cornerback. He said that "99%" of the freshmen class will likely 
redshirt. One who may not is Jamal Duff, a 6-foot-7 linebacker from Tustin who 
has stood out during freshman drills this week. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a place for a freshman, we would not redshirt him," Luginbill said. 
"But he would have to make a contribution. We don't want to waste a year with a 
freshman who is playing three or four plays in a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Community college transfers Lou Foster (5-11, 230 pounds, DeAnza Community 
College) and Andy Coviello (6-0, 215, Sacramento City College) should make an 
impact during the next three weeks, Foster at inside linebacker and Coviello at 
outside linebacker. Both had earned starting jobs by the time spring practice 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
As for the secondary, the Aztecs will work on making up for the loss of All-WAC 
nickelback John Wesselman. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Luginbill would like SDSU to be more consistent, starting with 
quarterback Dan McGwire, who, despite impressive numbers, was sometimes more a 
thrower than a passer last season according to Luginbill. Still, he threw for 
3,651 yards, the second-most in a single season in SDSU history. 
</P>
<P>
Things are also more stable off the field as Luginbill begins his second season 
at SDSU. Most of the players are familiar with the coaching staff's demands, 
making for a smoother and more productive environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you have continuity . . . " Luginbill said, smiling. "The same staff, 
you know each other, you've been around the kids day in and day out, you know 
strengths and weaknesses . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He left unspoken the two most obvious words: It helps. "This football team 
going into the season is a better football team than in 1989," he said. 
"Physically we're better, and we're better in the intangibles -- discipline and 
doing things right consistently. All of those things are better than a year ago 
-- comparing at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"How much better will be proven in each game as we go along. That's the 
measuring stick. We've got 11 of them, and we're looking very forward to every 
one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore defensive end Mark Hyatt quit Tuesday, notifying Coach Al Luginbill 
that he no longer wishes to play football. Hyatt, from Fountain Valley, 
redshirted last year. He apparently still intends to enroll in school. . . . 
Aside from linebacker Jamal Duff, SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said three other 
newcomers have stood out during drills the past week: freshman tight end Mark 
Ziegler (Mira Mesa High School), freshman safety Steve Rudisill (Thousand Oaks) 
and sophomore cornerback Damon Pieri (Phoenix Community College). . . . 
Luginbill has moved freshman Michael Wynn (San Fernando) from quarterback to 
safety and freshman Chad Provensal (Bakersfield) from inside linebacker to 
outside linebacker.

GORDON DECIDES TO WAIT BEFORE GIVING COLLEGE BASEBALL A TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Simi Valley High second baseman Joe Gordon, who hit 15 home runs last 
spring to equal the second-highest season total in Southern Section history, 
will attend Moorpark College this fall but will not play baseball for the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who expressed interest in attending USC and UCLA, said he will use the 
next year to improve his strength with a weight-training program and 
concentrate on academics. Gordon contracted mononucleosis this summer and his 
weight has dropped from 160 to 145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been really sick," Buddy Gordon, Joe's father, said. "But it turns out 
that it's kind of nice that he's not getting right back into baseball." 
</P>
<P>
According to Buddy Gordon, his son received only an offer of a partial 
scholarship from USC. Joe Gordon said that if he does play junior college 
baseball after next season, he would play at Pierce for Coach Bob Lofrano. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to work out on my own for now," he said. "I'm only 17, so I'm 
still pretty young. I could use the time to mature, and still be an 18-year-old 
freshman when I enter college (competition)." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon hit .377 last spring and his 15 homers tied former Simi Valley player 
Scott Sharts for second on the Southern Section list. Channel Islands' Arnold 
Garcia set the single-season record with 16 homers in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran and UC Riverside also expressed interest in Gordon, but he 
rejected both because of their NCAA Division II status. 
</P>
<P>
"We just weren't interested in the Division II level," Buddy Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
This one's for you, coach: Simi Valley baseball Coach Mike Scyphers returned 
from a vacation Sunday with the game ball from the first major league win of 
Chicago White Sox pitcher Scott Radinsky, who pitched for Scyphers at Simi 
Valley. Radinsky, the Southern Section 5-A Division Player of the Year in 1986, 
earned the win in relief on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he should be hanging on to it, but he gave it to me anyway," 
Scyphers said, "I told him I'd give it back to him in 10 years, when it will 
probably mean a lot more to him." 
</P>
<P>
Scyphers and his wife, Sally, attended four White Sox games last weekend, 
including one in which Radinsky earned his fourth save. "There were a couple of 
rain delays, so it was about 1:30 in the morning when he got it," Scyphers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling better: Canyon running back David McDivitt, hospitalized in intensive 
care less than a month ago, is almost fully recovered and is practicing with 
the Cowboys, according to Coach Harry Welch. 
</P>
<P>
McDivitt, who sustained a concussion during a passing-league game July 18, is 
expected to start at tailback for Canyon on Aug. 30 in Honolulu's Aloha 
Stadium. The Cowboys open their season with a nonleague game against Hawaii's 
St. Louis High, winner of 54 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's looking real good," Welch said. "He may not be 100% yet, but his recovery 
has been great." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, McDivitt gained 459 yards in 84 carries and scored four touchdowns. He 
lost consciousness after landing on his head last month and was taken to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Caught short: North Hollywood football Coach Fred Grimes thought he had 
resolved the problem of a weak preconference schedule when he added games with 
Notre Dame and St. Genevieve the past two seasons. The games with the tough 
Southern Section schools prepared the Huskies for the Valley Pac-8 Conference 
season and also helped North Hollywood at the gate because the schools are 
located in neighboring communities, Grimes said.

<P>
But the Huskies enter the 1990 season with the shortest schedule in the area. 
North Hollywood will play only eight games, none with Notre Dame or St. 
Genevieve. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes attributes the loss of the two games to the protracted battle over 
releaguing that tied up schedules for Catholic schools until late winter. When 
the Southern Section finally approved the Catholic school releaguing proposal, 
neither Notre Dame nor St. Genevieve had room for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad we're not playing because it was a good situation for all three 
schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood then scrambled to find two new teams to join Palisades on its 
preconference schedule. A series of miscommunications with a number of other 
City Section schools left the Huskies on the short end, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare because of the releaguing thing and then the problems with 
the City schools," he said.

DIGEST: VENDITTO RESIGNS AS CAL LUTHERAN SOFTBALL COACH AFTER RECORD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After leading the Cal Lutheran softball team to the best single-season record 
in school history, Tony Venditto resigned Tuesday as coach, according to the 
school's sports information department. 
</P>
<P>
In his only season at Cal Lutheran, Venditto coached the Regals to their third 
consecutive NAIA District 3 championship and a 32-12-2 record. Cal Lutheran 
advanced to the Bi-District tournament before being eliminated by Adams State 
(Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
Venditto coached at Bel-Air Prep before he took the Cal Lutheran post. He 
reportedly is moving to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hector Nieves, who resigned July 25 from his positions as women's 
track and cross-country coach at Cal Lutheran, has been rehired for both jobs, 
according to a university release. 
</P>
<P>
Nieves had coached the teams for four years before resigning for personal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Don Goetzinger, a biology teacher for 22 years at Thousand Oaks High, has been 
named boys' cross-country coach at the Marmonte League school. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dunlap, who coached the Lancer boys' team to the Southern Section 4-A 
Division preliminaries last fall, will head the girls' program. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Farrell headed the boys' program for 14 years, guiding the Lancers to 4-A 
championships in 1980, '84 and '86. Farrell resigned after the '88 season but 
Goetzinger, whose son Shawn competed for Camarillo -- the 1989 state champion 
and a league rival of Thousand Oaks -- opted to forgo the position for another 
year rather than risk a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Brats, a softball team for girls aged 18 and under, finished in a 
four-way tie for ninth in the 60-team national tournament that concluded Sunday 
in Lodi, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The Brats won their first three games -- beating the Utah Stars, the Oklahoma 
Sting and the California Grapettes -- to reach the final-12 bracket of the 
tournament. The Brats then dropped two in a row and came home. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Thatcher, a senior-to-be at Agoura High who pitched the Chargers to 
Southern Section 1-A Division titles in 1989 and '90, led the Brats with eight 
hits in 17 at-bats. She also scored four runs from the lead-off position. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Pedroza of Ventura defeated New Zealand's Josh Grant, 6-2, 6-1, Tuesday in 
the U.S. National Amateur tennis championships at Kiamesha Lake, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Emilee Klein of Studio City shot an 82 Tuesday and is 10 strokes behind the 
leader after two rounds of the U.S. Girls' Junior Championship at Manasquan 
River Golf Club Course in Brielle, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Klein opened with a 75 on the par-73 course Monday and has a two-day total of 
157. Vicki Goetze of Hull, Ga., is the leader.

BUSH ASSAILS DEMOCRATS OVER STALLED BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Bush blamed the federal budget impasse on Democrats in Congress 
Tuesday, lashing out at lawmakers for trying to gain political advantage from 
the issue rather than negotiating in good faith to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I kept my share of the bargain," Bush told a nationally televised news 
conference. "Now it is up to the Democrats who control Congress." 
</P>
<P>
But congressional Democrats quickly responded with a well-orchestrated attack 
of their own on White House budget policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I am saddened to see the President resort to partisan complaining on the 
budget," House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said in a statement. 
"For months the budget summit has been meeting in good faith to address a 
deficit that is the direct result of 10 years of Reagan-Bush economic and 
fiscal policies." 
</P>
<P>
Bush warned lawmakers that they would "bear heavy responsibility" if a failure 
to reach a budget agreement next month forces him to impose potentially 
crippling automatic spending cuts on Oct. 1, affecting an array of defense and 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"As painful as such deep cuts would be, I must uphold the law," Bush said. "I'm 
determined to manage them as best I can, knowing that I've done all in my power 
to avoid them." 
</P>
<P>
Bush faces serious problems, however, in trying to carry out such a threat. 
Many lawmakers are convinced that the White House has little choice but to find 
a way to avoid the roughly $100 billion in spending cuts called for under the 
Gramm-Rudman budget law because the Pentagon could not live with the 
consequences during the current crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman law would be revised if a deficit accord is reached, easing 
the targets and extending the timetable for achieving a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Persian Gulf has complicated the budget problem even further 
by boosting military outlays and by increasing the risk of recession because of 
higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed to veto any spending legislation that would make the deficit deeper 
and renewed his pledge to support a capital gains tax reduction as a means to 
spur economic growth. The White House believes that lowering the tax on gains 
from the sale of investment assets, such as stocks and bonds, would boost 
business investment and help revive the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is fearful that a large deficit will keep interest 
rates high and plunge the economy into a recession, perhaps endangering Bush's 
reelection prospects in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Our current budget, or lack thereof, constitutes a real threat to the economic 
well-being of this country," the President said in an unusually long opening 
statement at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the risks to the economy, Bush said he wants budget negotiators to 
stick to their ambitious original goal of slashing next year's federal deficit 
by $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, several lawmakers, worried that recent oil price hikes might cause 
a recession, have suggested scaling back the size of next year's 
deficit-reduction budget package to lessen any immediate negative impact on the 
already sluggish U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush took advantage of his afternoon news conference, carried live on all 
television networks, to turn up the heat on Congress at a time when his 
personal popularity is riding high over the White House's handling of the 
situation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The President met with reporters shortly after returning to Washington from his 
Maine vacation home for two days of talks and briefings. Before his news 
conference, Bush gathered with advisers to discuss the budget, but Budget 
Director Richard G. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady were out of 
town and did not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bush argued that the budget negotiations have dragged on for more than three 
months without any substantive accomplishment so far, largely because 
congressional Democrats have been trying to gain extra leverage over the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some saying: 'Hey, we think we got the President over a barrel 
here. We've made him back away and give and give and give and get nothing,' " 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were stalemated when Congress left for its summer recess 
earlier this month, are scheduled to resume after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently displaying strong emotion over the budget issue, Bush accused 
Democrats of "laughing all the way to what they think is the electoral bank." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic lawmakers, however, insisted that they are not to blame for the 
impasse over how to reduce a deficit expected to exceed $220 billion next year 
unless the White House and Congress can agree on spending cuts and tax 
increases to narrow the budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's statement on the budget was not accurate and not helpful," 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said. "If there has been an 
'abdication of responsibilities' on the budget, it has been on the part of the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
Bush defended his Administration's conduct of the budget negotiations with 
Congress, contending that he had gone the extra mile in trying to jump-start 
the deadlocked budget talks in late June by backing down on his "no new tax" 
campaign pledge. 
</P>
<P>
But, although Republicans have suffered politically from Bush's decision to 
change course and present a new proposal that includes higher taxes, Bush said 
Democrats have failed to respond with a budget plan of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"After three full months, the Democrats have yet to offer one single proposal 
at the budget summit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Congress left town, Republican lawmakers disclosed a White House 
plan to sharply raise taxes on alcoholic beverages and to limit deductions for 
state and local taxes. But the proposal was never formally presented to 
Democrats, who decided not to present a counterproposal of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Budget negotiators are expected to try to go into hiding when they resume 
bargaining next month. Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said he was told that talks 
will resume on or about Sept. 5 at Andrews Air Force Base, home to the White 
House's Air Force One about 15 miles east of Washington. He said he plans to 
sleep at Andrews.

BUSH THREATENS JORDAN PORT, WILL MEET KING IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT PRESSURES HUSSEIN TO JOIN THE GLOBAL EMBARGO AGAINST 
IRAQ. THE MONARCH MAY BE CARRYING A NEW PEACE PROPOSAL.

<P>
President Bush indicated Tuesday that he will blockade Jordan's only port 
unless Jordan joins the embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Bush said he will meet Jordan's King Hussein in 
Maine on Thursday to discuss the crisis, and he held out the possibility of 
financial aid should Jordan accept the American-led embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Aqaba should be closed," Bush said, if the Jordanian port becomes "a hole 
through which commerce flows in an otherwise tight net." 
</P>
<P>
The statement marked the first direct threat during the current crisis of 
hostile American action against an Arab country other than Iraq, and it 
demonstrated the tremendous pressure being exerted on Middle Eastern nations to 
choose sides in the 12-day-old confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has been desperately seeking to avoid having to pick a side, 
trying to placate both his traditional Western patrons and his powerful Iraqi 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The king may be carrying a new peace proposal to Bush, Jordanian officials 
indicated. On Monday, King Hussein met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein -- 
the two are not related -- then called Bush to ask to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
But the President, at a White House news conference, seemed uninterested in 
anything short of an unconditional withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait and the 
return of the exiled Kuwaiti royal family. Such a humiliating defeat for Iraq 
almost certainly would topple Saddam Hussein's government, Middle East experts 
say. Overthrowing the Iraqi regime is a key, but unstated, aim of U.S. policy 
during the current crisis, Administration officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental problem" in the crisis is that Iraq "took over Kuwait and that 
they've got to get out of Kuwait and they've got to let the rightful rulers 
return," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the President added, chances of a diplomatic solution to the 
confrontation seem remote. "I don't see it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Once the economic sanctions against Iraq have had a chance to work, the Iraqis 
may be more accommodating, Bush said. But "the economic sanctions are just 
beginning to bite," he added. "It will take a while." 
</P>
<P>
In his telephone call to Bush on Monday, the Jordanian king said only that he 
"would like to come over and talk about the whole situation," the President 
said. "There was no agenda" nor any indication that he was coming "as a 
specific emissary of one kind or another." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's port at Aqaba is key to any attempt to shut off Iraqi commerce. Most 
of Iraq's crucial grain imports are unloaded from ships at Aqaba, then trucked 
across the desert to Baghdad. So far, the Jordanians have kept the port open, 
going so far as to arrest the Norwegian skipper of one merchant ship in Aqaba 
to force him to unload grain headed for Iraq after the captain tried to leave 
port to observe the international embargo, Norwegian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein left Jordan on Tuesday and is expected to arrive in Washington 
early today. He then plans to fly to Kennebunkport, Me., on Thursday for the 
meeting. Bush, meanwhile, left Kennebunkport on Tuesday for White House 
meetings and will return to his vacation home today after briefings at the 
Pentagon. Although both the President and the king will be in Washington at the 
same time today, they will wait until Thursday to meet because Hussein wants 
time to rest, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Having displayed the stick that could be wielded against Jordan, Bush also 
dangled a carrot, saying, "We've always been a friend of Jordan. We've helped 
them in the past. We'd help them in the future if they fulfill their 
obligations." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Bush said, he had spoken with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu about stepping up Japanese aid to Middle Eastern countries that are 
cooperating in the American-led effort. Japan currently supplies aid to Jordan, 
Egypt and Turkey, all three key countries in the current confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are more than ready to entertain proposals along those lines," 
Bush said, indicating that Japan may also help defray some of the costs that 
the United States has incurred in the massive military buildup in Saudi Arabia 
and neighboring waters. 
</P>
<P>
The operation is "not a freebie," Bush said, although he said that he still 
does not have specific cost figures. Nor, he said, could he say how long U.S. 
troops are likely to stay. "Long enough to get the job done," Bush said. "I'd 
like to give you a time frame, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also shied away from answering questions about American citizens being 
detained in Iraq and Kuwait, calling their plight "a troubling situation" but 
adding that "the more we talk about it, and the more we speculate about it, the 
less helpful it is." 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts on the Voice of America beamed to the Middle East urged Americans in 
Kuwait not to attempt to flee "due to the danger involved." The Americans, who 
now number about 2,500, according to U.S. officials, should be prepared to 
leave as soon as "the orderly evacuation of Americans wishing to leave Kuwait 
becomes possible," the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Although hundreds of foreigners stranded in Kuwait by the Iraqi invasion have 
been able to slip out of the country, at least one -- a British businessman -- 
was shot by Iraqi troops as he tried to cross the Saudi Arabian border. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's visit is only one of a series of continuing diplomatic maneuvers 
surrounding the Persian Gulf confrontation. On Tuesday, for example, Assistant 
Secretary of State John Kelly met in Damascus with Syrian officials, including 
President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has agreed to join Egypt in sending troops to Saudi Arabia, a key step in 
trying to defuse Iraq's claim to be defending Arab nationalism against Western 
power. In addition, U.S. officials hope that Syria, which shares a long and 
tense border with Iraq, can distract Iraqi troops and aid in destabilizing 
Saddam Hussein's government. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Undersecretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt met with officials from 
the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China to discuss the possibility of a 
United Nations military command to coordinate any blockade against Iraq. Such a 
step would help eliminate criticism that the United States is acting 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
And other U.S. officials continued discussions with oil-producing nations about 
increasing output. The talks, Bush said, make him "confident" that other 
producers will make up for the shortfall caused by taking Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil 
off the world market. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. military forces in the Middle East continue to build, and 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, speaking to troops in Georgia before they head 
to Saudi Arabia, warned Iraq against using chemical weapons to attack U.S. 
soldiers. Although the United States would probably not use chemical weapons in 
response, Cheney said, the military has a "wide range of measures" available. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Pentagon confirmed reports that the aircraft carrier John F. 
Kennedy will head today for the Mediterranean, carrying about 80 warplanes and 
accompanied by seven other ships. When it arrives in about three weeks, the 
Navy will have four carriers -- nearly a third of its carrier fleet -- plus a 
battleship and dozens of supporting vessels in the waters surrounding the 
Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier Eisenhower is in the Red Sea, the Independence is in the Gulf of 
Oman just outside the Persian Gulf, and the Saratoga is in the Atlantic about 
ready to enter the Mediterranean, where it will join the battleship Wisconsin, 
Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also announced that advance elements of two California-based 
units, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton and the 7th 
Marine Expeditionary Brigade from Twentynine Palms, had arrived in Saudi 
Arabia. Officials declined to say exactly how many troops are now in place to 
support what the military has dubbed Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
So far, although U.S. officials have said that the Navy would block ships 
trying to carry cargo to or from Iraq, the Administration has avoided declaring 
an official "blockade," and Iraq has not tried to test the quarantine. Navy 
officials believe that they probably have at least another couple of days 
before a test comes, officials said.

AQABA, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The half-dozen employees of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Co., a private 
freight forwarder, sat Tuesday beneath a poster depicting the crossed flags of 
Iraq and Jordan as they emphatically fingered their worry beads. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a week, they said, no ship with cargo for Iraq has docked at the 
Red Sea port, and the workers wondered when, or if, any would. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not usual," said Isa Habaiba, a wiry worker. "We do not know what to 
think." 
</P>
<P>
The hot, sleepy port of Aqaba, Jordan's only window on the sea, is suddenly a 
center of international tension. The government of Jordan has refused to 
implement a U.N. ban on trade with Jordan's next-door neighbor, Iraq, which the 
Security Council imposed after Iraq's invasion of the tiny oil state of Kuwait 
on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal to close off Aqaba to Iraqi trade puts Jordan in conflict with the 
United States. Jordan's leader, King Hussein, is visiting Washington today in 
hopes of playing an arbiter's role in the conflict between the United States 
and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials have expressed disappointment that Jordan has not 
applied the U.N. sanctions. By putting warships in the Red Sea, the 
Administration has indicated that it may take the issue out of King Hussein's 
hands and blockade Aqaba, located on a gulf that is an arm of the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has announced that American ships will enforce the embargo in both 
the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, even though the United Nations stopped short 
of ordering a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
This makes for a nervous Jordanian port. "I think our business will shrink," 
said Habaiba, who told visitors that his company deals only in general cargo 
and not arms. 
</P>
<P>
Awad Tell, the port director at Aqaba, told reporters that he has received no 
orders from Amman, Jordan's capital, to stop Iraqi use of the port. Freight 
shippers said that earlier in the week the Norwegian freighter Tanga unloaded a 
cargo of wheat bound for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything here is normal," said Tell. "We have received no special 
instructions." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Iraqi cargo had arrived or is expected, he answered with a 
brusque, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Jordan has emerged as one of Iraq's most vocal allies. King 
Hussein attacked the sending of American troops to defend Saudi Arabia as a 
step toward colonizing the Arab world. Government officials have evaded the 
question of whether Jordan will help implement U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the monarch's brother, Prince Hassan, said that if Jordan is forced 
to limit shipping at Aqaba, the country would expect to receive money in 
return. "When the position of the navies moves from imposing sanctions to a 
blockade and that threatens everyone in the region . . . I think those affected 
are due compensation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite King Hussein's reluctance to act, cargo arriving at Aqaba for overland 
shipment to Iraq seems to have slowed. Abdul Khader Amro, a freight forwarder, 
said that at least five ships with Iraq-bound cargoes, seeking to sail from the 
Mediterranean into the Red Sea, are being delayed at the Suez Canal by Egypt, 
which backs the embargo against Iraq. The cargoes, Amro said, include oil 
equipment and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
"My silos are empty," he said. "Egypt is taking orders from America." 
</P>
<P>
Aqaba sits at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba and shares a crescent-moon bay with 
the Israeli city of Eilat to the west. The towns, which are in sight of each 
other, are not on speaking terms: Jordan does not recognize Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The closeness to Israel is another cause for worry among workers at the port. 
David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, has accused Jordan of permitting Aqaba 
to help Iraq evade the embargo. Jordanians took this as a warning that Israel 
itself might block the port. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the last time that Aqaba was in the world's headlines was when T. E. 
Lawrence, the fabled Lawrence of Arabia, organized an attack by Arab rebels on 
a Turkish garrison at the port during World War I. The charge by a camel 
brigade from the desert galvanized the Arab revolt that Britain subsequently 
encouraged to tie down troops of the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Aqaba baked in 95-degree heat, but port workers said they 
considered it a cool day. Seven ships sat on the mirror-flat waters of the 
port. Three had arrived during the day. One was from Sudan and carried cotton, 
another from France carried sugar, and a third from Yugoslavia was filled with 
general cargo. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were not permitted to visit the port, and police inspected the notes 
of several journalists who held interviews at businesses just outside the main 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanians were not the only ones on the Red Sea shore to express tension 
Tuesday. Not far away, the Israelis were feeling some of it too. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope nothing happens here," said Hila Meroz, gazing from Eilat across the 
Jordanian frontier at the ships in Aqaba harbor Tuesday afternoon. "I hope 
there won't be any war." 
</P>
<P>
The blonde, swimsuit-clad schoolteacher had just emerged from the salty waters 
of the gulf. A few hundred yards out in the water, an Israeli gunboat swung at 
its mooring buoy, almost bow-to-bow with a smaller Jordanian patrol boat on the 
seaward side. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first time we've seen that Jordanian boat pull away from its dock," 
said an Israeli soldier, sitting in a jeep assigned to guard the border. 
</P>
<P>
The land border between these twin cities is marked by an Israeli bunker flying 
the Star of David and mounting an array of electronic monitoring devices. 
</P>
<P>
The seaside frontier is designated by several red and white buoys, with signs 
in Hebrew warning sailors that they are about to enter Jordanian waters. 
</P>
<P>
Behind both cities rise harsh, rust-colored mountains, without a shred of 
foliage, baking in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a favorite resort of Israelis in the summer and northern 
Europeans in the winter, Eilat is also an important Israeli port. On Tuesday, a 
ship was unloading cars from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But attention here is focused on the ships in Aqaba, at anchor and docked. 
Israeli intelligence agents have been keeping a sharp eye on seaborne traffic 
into Aqaba, which is King Hussein's favorite Jordanian resort, a place where he 
often water skis with guests. 
</P>

JORDAN'S KING COULD MAKE, OR BREAK, U.S. GULF EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unexpected emergency mission to Washington by Jordan's King Hussein, 
America's oldest ally in the Arab world, marks the emergence of a new player in 
the Persian Gulf crisis -- a player with the singular power to make or break 
the U.S. effort to force an Iraqi retreat from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe, and fear, that the king will present President Bush 
with proposals for diplomatic compromise that could seriously complicate the 
task of maintaining international unity against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- 
especially in the Arab world. The king's sudden trip follows an equally 
dramatic mission, by helicopter and then car, to Baghdad, where the Jordanian 
leader talked at length with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The king's expected effort to stimulate compromise stirs concern among U.S. 
officials on two counts. The Bush Administration believes, first, that the 
likely proposals offer no serious basis for negotiation. Far more important, 
U.S. officials fear that any diplomatic back-and-forth now could sow disunity 
at a time when Bush is seeking to impose a controversial naval quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
The king's proposals for Bush are believed to contain a compromise formula 
based on the plan offered Sunday by President Hussein (no relation to the 
Jordanian leader). That plan has already been rejected by the Administration. 
Saddam Hussein's proposal, among other things, made Iraqi withdrawal from 
Kuwait conditional on Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands -- an 
issue that the United States considers unrelated to the seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Arab envoys in Washington portrayed the plan as important not for its contents 
but for the signal it sends. "It is an opening," Iraqi Ambassador to the U.S. 
Mohammed Mashat asserted in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been an opening," agreed Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League envoy to 
the United Nations. "It may be small, but it's an opening. 
</P>
<P>
"King Hussein wants to widen that opening and therefore defuse the level of 
tension and restore a negotiating mechanism. He is, after all, the only man who 
can talk to all sides -- the Iraqis, the Americans, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis," 
Maksoud added. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Administration officials, by contrast, believe that no variation on 
Iraq's initiative will be acceptable because it falls short of a total Iraqi 
retreat and restoration of the previous government of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no room for a deal that allows Iraq any control over Kuwait, however 
distant," said one ranking U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials also are skeptical about reports Tuesday that the 
cornered Baghdad regime is offering an olive branch because of fear that the 
United States and other members of the multinational military force being 
assembled in Saudi Arabia eventually intend to invade Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq knows exactly what our intentions are," the ranking official said 
dismissively. 
</P>
<P>
If the talks between the king and President Bush, scheduled for Thursday at the 
President's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., fall short of laying the 
groundwork for a diplomatic resolution, Arab and U.S. officials fear that the 
king may tell the Administration bluntly that his country cannot afford to cut 
off Iraq totally. Jordan could then effectively provide the single lifeline, 
through land routes and Jordan's Red Sea port at Aqaba, that Baghdad needs to 
survive otherwise-crippling economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush used a news conference Tuesday afternoon to warn the king 
even before his arrival here that any such attempt to supply Iraq through Aqaba 
could lead to a blockade of the Jordanian port. 
</P>
<P>
The "plucky little king," as the diminutive Jordanian monarch is widely known 
in the Middle East for his political daring, has few options. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has assisted virtually every U.S. initiative in the Middle East 
since he came to power in 1952 after his grandfather's assassination, King 
Hussein's largest trading partner is Iraq. About 95% of Jordan's oil comes from 
Iraq. Kuwait supplied the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
Also, income from Baghdad's use of Jordanian roads and ports to transship goods 
accounts for the largest share of the foreign exchange earnings Jordan needs to 
do trade with the rest of the world. About 500 trucks traverse Jordan's searing 
desert each day en route to Iraq. And about 25% of Jordan's exports are bought 
by Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Without outside help, Jordan's deeply indebted economy could not afford to cut 
off Iraq. Annual U.S. aid to Amman provides only $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly in terms of implementation, we just don't turn off a switch in our 
dealing with Iraq," Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, the king's younger brother 
and foreign affairs adviser, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan respects the U.N. mandate . . . but (sanctions) would bring our economy 
to a standstill. Any country affected by these sanctions is clearly eligible 
for compensation." 
</P>
<P>
Yet while Bush in his news conference held out some hope of further aid to 
Jordan, Administration officials conceded that neither the United States nor 
even the oil-rich gulf states may be in a position to offset Jordan's total 
earnings from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis and Kuwaitis are already begining to stretch themselves a little 
thin in compensation to other nations and in paying for some aspects of the 
military deployment," said one senior U.S. analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Two other factors exert pressure on the king: a restive Jordanian population 
and a strategic border with Iraq that could become vulnerable to attack if 
Jordan blocks transshipments. The king's last trip to Washington in 1989 was 
cut short because of riots over food prices at home. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Saddam Hussein demonstrations in Jordan, especially among Palestinians who 
account for more than half of Jordan's population, have underscored the 
polarization in the Arab world since the crisis began two weeks ago. Even 
Palestinian members of the Israeli Knesset have voiced support for Iraq and 
criticized the United States for its military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodesia, another landlocked nation sanctioned by both East and West in 1967, 
survived 13 years because of South Africa's trade and ports. Not until South 
Africa decided to squeeze Rhodesia in 1980 did the white minority government 
finally agree to majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan's compliance is absolutely necessary to pull this off," one State 
Department analyst said. "Without the king, we could be looking at years of 
stalemate."

POLITICS: LOBBYISTS DESCRIBE MEETINGS WITH FORMER STATE SENATOR. ONE SAYS THERE 
WAS 'NO QUESTION' OF A SHAKEDOWN ATTEMPT.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Capitol lobbyists and a Southern California businessman testified Tuesday 
that former state Sen. Paul Carpenter pressured them to give money to his 
campaign when they went to see him privately on legislative matters. 
</P>
<P>
"We were shaken down for money in that meeting, no question about it," said 
Jeff Thompson, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., 
an organization of prison guards. "It was real clear if we did not play the 
game we were not going to get support from him." 
</P>
<P>
In the second day of Carpenter's trial on political corruption charges, 
representatives of a Los Angeles medical school, a hospital company, farmers, a 
smog testing firm and the prison guards told jurors that the former Democratic 
senator balked at discussing legislative issues and questioned why he had not 
received their financial support. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, however, defense attorney Gerard Hinckley succeeded 
in shaking the testimony of several of the prosecution witnesses, including one 
former lobbyist who admitted that his memory of his meeting with Carpenter was 
"somewhat blurred." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, now a member of the State Board of Equalization, is on trial on four 
counts of racketeering, attempted extortion and conspiracy stemming from his 
meetings with the lobbyists and his acceptance of $20,000 from an undercover 
FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, witness after witness told of meeting with Carpenter in his office 
to discuss issues of importance to them. But when their meetings began, 
witnesses said, Carpenter used his computer to call up a record of their 
legislative campaign contributions or referred to a printout of their 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Carpenter date back to the mid-1980s and, in one case, to 
1980. But the prosecution witnesses said they recalled their meetings with 
Carpenter because they were surprised by his unusual pitch for a contribution 
at the same meeting in which legislation was discussed. Only one witness, 
businessman Bill Canup, said he could recall a similar solicitation from a 
legislator -- the late Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-Inglewood). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the strongest testimony against Carpenter came from Thompson, the 
prison guards' lobbyist, who said he went to see the senator in 1985 to get his 
support for a bill designed to help state prison guards get a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Carpenter had blocked passage of the measure when it was considered by 
the Senate Public Employees and Retirement Committee, the lobbyist testified. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he met with Carpenter in his office and began to discuss the 
bill, but the senator immediately switched subjects. He said that Carpenter, 
holding a record of the group's contributions, questioned why the prison guards 
had never given him money but had donated to the campaign of his Republican 
rival, then-Sen. H. L. Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation ended after Thompson agreed to accept a fund-raising 
invitation from the senator. Thompson told the jury that he clearly remembered 
the meeting because "it was the most pressure I'd ever had." 
</P>
<P>
The prison guards' association later gave Carpenter a $1,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
But under Hinckley's cross-examination, Thompson acknowledged that Carpenter 
subsequently voted for the bill on two occasions before he ever received the 
group's contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also acknowledged that in the four months before the payment to 
Carpenter, the prison guards' association had given legislators and Gov. George 
Deukmejian about $100,000 in contributions to "begin establishing relationships 
with members of both parties." 
</P>
<P>
Gavin McHugh, another lobbyist for the prison guards, followed Thompson to the 
witness stand and gave a similar account of the meeting with Carpenter. But he 
differed with Thompson on one critical point, saying he did not recall any 
mention of the legislation before Carpenter began talking about campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Haley, a former lobbyist for the Western Growers Assn., testified that 
Carpenter raised the subject of contributions at a similar 1984 meeting where 
Haley hoped to discuss legislative matters. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly got the message that we had not contributed to him or his 
compadres and he was not inclined to hear the views we wanted to express," said 
Haley, now a top official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
But under questioning by the defense, Haley admitted that he did not recall 
what issue he wanted to discuss with the senator, saying that his recollection 
of the events was "somewhat blurred." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Palisades businessman Canup also had difficulty remembering details of 
his meeting with Carpenter, which took place in the fall of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Canup testified that as a representative of Hamilton Test Systems, an Orange 
County company that conducted auto smog testing, he visited Carpenter in his 
district office to promote the firm's interest in pending legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of discussing the issue, Canup told the jury, Carpenter turned to 
his computer and began talking about the company's campaign contributions. As 
he left, Canup said, the senator handed him an invitation to a fund-raising 
event. 
</P>
<P>
But during cross-examination, defense lawyer Hinckley said he would introduce 
evidence to show that Carpenter did not have a computer in his district office 
at that time. In addition, Hinckley pointed out, the company could not have had 
an interest in any bills pending in the fall of 1980 because by then the 
Legislature had already adjourned its session. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also heard testimony from lobbyists for American Medical 
International, a hospital firm, and the Charles Drew Postgraduate Medical 
School in Los Angeles, who said Carpenter declined to discuss legislation and 
raised the question of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Carpenter asked me if my company would support him in his reelection 
bid," testified former American Medical International lobbyist Ronald Fox. "I 
was kind of taken aback."

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crews began clearing fire-weakened trees from alongside Yosemite roads Tuesday 
as a first step toward reopening the park to visitors next week, while 
elsewhere the rash of California wild-land blazes claimed a first life. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Kenneth Earl Anslow, 20, died at a Chico hospital of injuries 
suffered when he was hit by a falling tree limb on a fire line in Mendocino 
National Forest. Anslow was from Fontana and worked for the Corona office of 
the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a state spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Northern California, helicopter pilot Van Honeycutt suffered a broken 
leg and other injuries when his aircraft crashed near Burney State Park while 
helping fight fires in Shasta County. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army troops from Ft. Carson, Colo., arrived to help fight the 
state's wildfires, which have burned 210,000 acres since being touched off by 
lightning earlier this month. About 1,200 soldiers may be used to support fire 
efforts in California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest of the fires, in Tehama County, had burned across 115,000 acres in 
the Sierra Nevada foothills, but was 80% contained within fire lines on 
Tuesday, the state fire command center announced. A second, smaller fire in 
Tehama County was 60% contained. 
</P>
<P>
Fears that new dry-lightning storms would sweep along the length of the Sierra 
Nevada on Tuesday and spark additional fires went unrealized, offering welcome 
relief. More than 31,000 lightning bolts have struck the ground in California's 
forests and brush lands since Aug. 3, according to electronic sensors that 
report strikes to fire officers. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials say firefighting resources across the West have been severely 
taxed by the flurry of blazes, which have been fed by timber and brush dried 
out by four years of drought. Across the West, more than 22,000 firefighters 
were on the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Yosemite National Park, 28 separate fires continue to smolder in the 
back country, where conditions are severely dry despite unusual snow flurries 
early this summer. But most of the Yosemite fires were being dismissed as 
insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Only the largest -- which have burned through 22,000 acres of mostly pine 
forest -- are receiving the focused attention of firefighters. The fire near 
the Arch Rock entrance that destroyed 66 buildings in the mountain village of 
Foresta had burned 17,000 acres, about half inside the park and half in 
Stanislaus National Forest. It was 70% contained Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Backfires set by firefighters to control the movement of the blaze were 
responsible for most of the approximately 3,000 additional acres scorched in 
the last day. 
</P>
<P>
Two other fires in the park, in the Steamboat and Aspen Canyon areas, were 
expected to be fully contained Thursday, rangers said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the disastrous fires may linger for years to come in the form of 
tumbling rocks, landslides and falling trees along Yosemite's major entrance 
roads, park Supt. Michael Finley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Potential danger to visitors is figuring heavily in considerations about when 
to reopen Yosemite Valley, the park's most visited feature. More than 10,000 
people a day in summer visit the valley, which has been all but empty since the 
evacuation of campers and tourists Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began clearing trees and fallen snags from along the park's three 
western entrance roads Tuesday. The fires left a trail of burned-out trees and 
a covering of ash along state California 41, and the cleanup effort will 
further alter the landscape in a way that will not be "aesthetic," Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot leave dead trees along the roads and we will be felling those," 
Finley said. "It's unfortunate but absolutely necessary for public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Safety of visitors also is threatened by loosened rocks on the cliffs above the 
entrance roads. The cliffs are normally bonded together by the roots of trees 
that burned. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect rock falls to be a real concern for years to come," Finley said. 
"It's like you've had something held together with a rope and the rope has been 
severed." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said the Tioga Pass Road, a popular route across the Sierra Nevada, is 
expected to reopen by the end of this week. Detailed plans for allowing 
visitors back into Yosemite Valley next week will be announced today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite Park and Curry Co., the private concessionaire that runs lodging for 
4,600 people in the valley, said it has offered those who held reservations 
this week a chance to reschedule. They also can receive refunds, but will not 
get special treatment for room reservations, which are in great demand in 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to compound problems by bumping someone else who has a 
reservation," said John Poimoroo, vice president of communications. "That would 
not be fair." 
</P>
<P>
Poimoroo and some National Park Service officials fear that hordes of the 
curious may clog major highways leading into the park after it reopens. He 
pointed to the case of Yellowstone National Park, which endured a crush of 
people wanting to see the effects of disastrous fires there two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Yosemite is only different in that it has a lot more day traffic," Poimoroo 
said. "We hope they hold off on day visits for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the public's return, park officials also made plans Tuesday to 
return rangers, campground hosts, maintenance workers and even secretaries who 
were pressed into fire duty back to their regular jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger Cherry Payne, who was temporarily assigned to the fire information 
center in the valley, had to abandon preparations for Yosemite's centennial 
celebration scheduled for Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even paid attention to the celebration for a week," said Payne, in 
charge of organizing the event. "My No. 1 priority was to get out invitations." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a hazardous-materials team continued to examine the remains of 
structures in Foresta, where firefighters found exposed asbestos and evidence 
of ruptured power transformers that may have contained toxic polychlorinated 
biphenyls, or PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick reported from Los Angeles and Sahagun from Yosemite. Times staff 
writer Harold Maass also contributed to this story from Yosemite.

Ventura Community College District Trustee James (Tom) Ely and his wife, 
Ingrid, were arrested here Tuesday on charges that they bilked the district of 
thousands of dollars in improper trip expenses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Elys were taken into custody by district attorney's investigators about 
7:15 p.m., just after they pulled into the driveway of their two-story home in 
their 1989 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
The shaken-looking couple said little during their arrest, in contrast to the 
confidence they displayed during a 4 1/2-month investigation of them by the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors filed a criminal indictment Tuesday. The couple were charged on two 
counts each of conspiracy to commit grand theft, and Tom Ely was also charged 
on eight counts of embezzlement and 19 counts of making a false or fraudulent 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
"This is stupid," Tom Ely said as the investigators handcuffed him and a dozen 
reporters and photographers looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was guilty, Ely said, "No. I'm not going to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Elys were booked at the main Ventura County Jail in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-page complaint alleges that the Elys conspired to misappropriate 
district funds on a series of trips they took between July 22, 1988, and Sept. 
17, 1989, to such destinations as Sacramento, Louisville, Ky., and Vancouver, 
Canada. The complaint also lists more than $12,000 in questionable expenses for 
which the district reimbursed the Elys after those trips. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that the couple sometimes double-billed the district for 
expenses -- Tom Ely submitting expense vouchers to the district and his wife 
claiming expenses to the Moorpark College Alumni Assn. Ingrid Ely founded the 
association in 1979. But she only served as an officer of the group in January, 
1989, and has never worked as a Moorpark College employee or trustee. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, on one trip to Canada, Ingrid Ely got a travel 
advance of $975 from Moorpark College President Stanley Bowers to help cover 
air fare, meals and room expenses that her husband later charged on the 
district's American Express card. 
</P>
<P>
The couple then checked into the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver on Sept. 16 -- 
four days before the convention they were attending was to begin -- and checked 
out on Sept. 23, after charging $1,605.89 to the district credit card. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 17, they also checked into the Empress Hotel on an apparent side trip 
to Victoria, British Columbia, and checked out the next day after charging 
$168.16 on the district credit card, the complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tom Ely charged $294.35 worth of goods at the Edinburgh Tartan 
Gift Shop in Victoria to the card, which he later submitted on an expense 
report without explanation, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, Tom Ely faces up to six years and Ingrid Ely up to 
three years and eight months in state prison prison.

BECHTEL GETS NOD FOR RAIL LINE TO VEGAS; 
</P>

TRANSPORTATION: TRAIN WOULD USE MAGNETIC LEVITATION SYSTEM AND AVERAGE 212 
M.P.H. IF ALL APPROVALS ARE GRANTED, ITS FIRST RUN COULD BE IN 1997.

<P>
A business consortium led by the Bechtel Corp. was designated Tuesday as the 
franchisee to build a privately funded 265-mile high-speed magnetic levitation 
rail line that would carry passengers between Anaheim and Las Vegas at an 
average speed of 212 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote by the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission is 
subject to at least a two-month negotiation of a formal franchise agreement. 
That would be followed by an extensive Bechtel financial feasibility study, a 
lengthy environmental impact review and formal votes by both the California and 
Nevada legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
Even if everything goes according to plan, the line would not be ready until 
1997. It would apparently still be the first long-distance "maglev" line in 
service in the world and perhaps the precursor to a new system of surface 
transportation with worldwide applications. 
</P>
<P>
In a magnetic levitation system, trains riding on a slight cushion of air are 
propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces. The technology to be used 
in this system has been developed by Transrapid of West Germany and is being 
tested on a 20-mile looping German track. 
</P>
<P>
According to specifications released Tuesday by commission Executive Director 
Paul Taylor, the eight-car, 800-passenger trains envisioned for the Anaheim-Las 
Vegas service would have a design speed of 310 m.p.h. and a maximum service 
speed of 265 m.p.h. Through urban portions of the route, mainly in Orange 
County, the train would go about 180 m.p.h., and through the Cajon Pass perhaps 
125 m.p.h., bringing the average nonstop speed to 212 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
This works out to a 75-minute nonstop one-way trip, or a 91-minute trip should 
the train make three stops. Proposed alternative routes would pass through 
Corona, Ontario, Victor Valley and Barstow, or Riverside and Colton in place of 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
It is not expected that the train would make all possible stops in any single 
run. According to Taylor, this would not be a major problem because of the high 
number of trains. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that on peak days, 52 trains would be scheduled, and during some 
hours one train every 15 minutes. Minimum service would be 25 trains a day. 
</P>
<P>
Fares would be $115 for full fare and an $80.48 discounted fare, but would be 
adjusted for inflation. Bechtel has been saying the system would cost $5 
billion, but Taylor's report indicated that as much as $7.8 billion in private 
financing would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Possible future spurs are envisioned by Bechtel to Palm Springs, Santa Ana and 
Palmdale. A separate business group recently proposed a slower, 80-m.p.h. 
maglev service, using Japanese technology, connecting in Palmdale on to Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
This consortium, led by the Perini Corp., has indicated that it would need a 
public cash subsidy of up to $100 million a year. The only government 
contribution the Bechtel group is asking for is a donation of rights-of-way, 
generally along the Riverside Freeway and Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale-Los Angeles Airport line -- unlike the Anaheim-Las Vegas line -- 
requires initial approval next month by the California Department of 
Transportation, as part of a separate state program to encourage privately 
funded road and rail projects. Caltrans can approve only four of the eight 
proposals submitted to it. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor sounded a note of caution on the Las Vegas line, saying that several 
consultants retained by the commission viewed the Bechtel proposal as vague in 
certain areas. He expressed hope that it would be made much more specific by 
the time the franchise agreement is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor expressed concern that Bechtel had not described the exact state of 
present maglev technology and noted that West Germany had not yet certified it 
for passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Arnie Adamsen of Las Vegas responded that he and two other 
commissioners had traveled to Germany last week and rode the train on an 
endurance run of 1 1/2 hours at speeds of 220 m.p.h. He said they had observed 
a run of 250 m.p.h.

Two Moorpark City Council members and a former parks and recreation 
commissioner have entered the race to become the city's first elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Clint Harper and Paul Lawrason filed papers last week for the 
two-year post, City Clerk Lilly Kellerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men served stints as mayor when the post was filled by a vote of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, 43, was elected to the council in 1986. He is a physics instructor at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrason, 61, was elected to the council in 1988 and has two years left in his 
term. He has been a contracts and pricing director for Teleflex Control Systems 
in Oxnard for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wheeler, 45, an assistant vice president of a Simi Valley survey and 
auditing services firm, served as chairman and vice chairman of the Moorpark 
Parks and Recreation Commission during his two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates are expected to run high-profile campaigns that will focus 
on whether the city of about 27,000 should continue to experience a high rate 
of growth -- 4.2% last year. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN NEAR CIVIC CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council has rejected a plan for a commercial and 
residential development on 38 acres across the street from the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
After a public hearing, during which several residents spoke against the 
project, the council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to uphold the Planning 
Commission's recommendation to deny the draft plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based Lusk Co. wants to build 51 single-family houses, 41 
townhouses, and 226,000 square feet of commercial and office space at the 
southwest corner of Tapo Canyon Road and Alamo Street. 
</P>
<P>
However, council members said they were not satisfied with the design of the 
commercial portion of the planned development, which they said should have a 
unique quality because of its proximity to the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the current proposal resembles a strip mall and is inconsistent 
with the city's General Plan, which calls for a "courtyard theme." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see a little more imagination put into it," Councilman Glen McAdoo 
said of the design. "It just doesn't satisfy what I was looking for in an area 
that's very different, very unique." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Lauener, project manager for Lusk Co., said he was disappointed with the 
council's decision because his company has worked closely with neighborhood 
groups and a city committee to come up with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company has been working on the project for three years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials sided with residents who objected to traffic from the commercial 
portion emptying onto a residential street. They said the commercial and 
residential areas should be separate. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Jay Corey said the Lusk Co. will have to redesign the 
Civic Center Plaza and make a new presentation to the Planning Commission 
before going back to the council. CARLOS V. LOZANO

RECYCLING FIRM GETS 1-MONTH CONTRACT

<P>
In an effort to reduce waste by 25%, Oxnard has joined in a short-term 
agreement to send an average of 50 tons of solid waste a day to a Ventura 
recycling company. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a 30-day contract with 
Gold Coast Recycling Co. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works analyst Stan Hakes said the 30-day contract will give the city a 
chance to evaluate the processing center and consider a long-term contract with 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
A state law requires all cities to reduce residential and commercial waste by 
25% by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard collects about 400 tons of commercial and industrial waste a day. A 
recent study indicates that much of the waste is made up of 80% to 99% 
recyclable material. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling center charges $39.50 a ton -- the same amount it costs to 
dispose of waste at a regional landfill. Hakes said that if the city joins Gold 
Coast in a revenue-sharing program, the sale of the recyclable material could 
reduce the cost to about $20 a ton. HUGO MARTIN

<P>
The operator of an Oxnard day-care home has lost her state license after 
investigators accused her husband of molesting a child in her care. 
</P>
<P>
According to records released by the state Department of Social Services 
earlier this month, Owen Jones was accused of sexually abusing an 8-year-old 
girl in January. 
</P>
<P>
He also told a 2-year-old witness that he would cut off her finger if she told 
anyone about the crime, Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Tricia Koenig said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the girls were in the care of Susan Jones, who ran a day-care home 
at 339 Maple St. in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
A warrant was issued for Jones' arrest, but the couple and their two daughters 
disappeared in late January, Koenig said. Officials suspect that they are in 
Canada. MAJA RADEVICH

D. A. TO KEEP STAFF OFF CRIMINAL JURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors no longer would be allowed to serve on criminal 
juries under a policy tentatively approved Tuesday by Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was drafted less than two weeks after a prosecutor served as foreman 
on a Municipal Court jury that convicted an Oxnard man of being under the 
influence of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Steven Hintz, who allowed Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride to sit 
on that jury, granted a new trial Friday to William Lopez, 28. Hintz made his 
ruling not because of Kilbride's jury service, but because he said the trial 
prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent Baker, violated Lopez's constitutional 
rights by asking whether he had refused to waive his rights to an attorney when 
he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said the new policy is "based on our conclusion that there is a 
conflict of interest in that case and in all future cases." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, any prosecutor called to jury duty must tell the judge 
about the policy and ask to be excused. If the judge refuses, the trial 
prosecutor should ask the defense attorney to excuse the prosecutor-juror. And 
if the defense refuses, the trial prosecutor should move to excuse the 
prosecutor-juror from the panel, the policy says. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County public defender's office already has a policy forbidding 
deputy public defenders from serving on juries in cases that it represents, 
Assistant Public Defender Jean L. Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
About six months ago, Farley said Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson was 
excused from the trial of a man who was being represented by a colleague, 
Stewart Spivak, now a private attorney. MACK REED

<P>
The filing of charges Tuesday against James (Tom) Ely and his wife, Ingrid, 
culminate five months of controversy surrounding the 54-year-old trustee of the 
Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, an elected trustee since 1979, was charged with eight counts of 
embezzlement, 19 counts of making a false or fraudulent claim and two counts of 
conspiracy to commit grand theft. Ingrid Ely was charged with two counts of 
conspiracy to commit grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
All along, Ely and his wife have maintained that they did nothing wrong. Ely 
has attacked The Times and other publications for printing "slanted" articles. 
</P>
<P>
The trustee's troubles came to light in March, when The Times quoted Nevada law 
enforcement officials who said that Ely owed $3,000 to the Edgewater Hotel and 
Casino in Laughlin, Nev., and that he had been sued the previous month by the 
Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. The suit claimed that Ely owed the Las Vegas casino 
more than $8,000 in gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, a retired insurance salesman who earns $400 a month as a trustee, at first 
denied having gambling debts or a gambling problem, saying he had paid the debt 
to the Laughlin casino in June, 1989. But Nevada police said that Ely did not 
pay the debt until after it was publicized in March, and that he paid only 
after being threatened with arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ely later acknowledged that he owed the Golden Nugget money for outstanding 
gambling debts. He said he was involved in a legal dispute over the amount he 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the gambling allegations, and Ely's admitted use of his district 
telephone to call Nevada casinos, the Board of Trustees voted March 17 to 
commission an audit of Ely's travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found that in the previous three years, Ely had charged the district 
$8,400 in expenses that the auditors considered questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the expenses were for trips to community college conventions in 
Sacramento, Florida, Kentucky and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the expenses were for a car rented at district expense for Ely 
to use after his own vehicle was damaged in a collision in January, 1989. Ely 
said that the accident occurred while he was conducting district business and 
that officials of Moorpark College -- one of the district's three schools -- 
offered to supply him with a car during the six months his car was being 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
The audit listed another $6,978 in claims submitted without proper 
documentation during the same three-year period. After receiving a copy of the 
audit, the district attorney's office began its criminal investigation of Ely. 
</P>
<P>
Ely denied owing the district any money, saying that the audit was flawed and 
that he had not violated district travel policy. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ely said the district owed him $600 for business-related calls that 
he had made from his home and car phone in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has denied having a gambling problem, but a Nevada law enforcement official 
told The Times that Ely had incurred a total of $40,000 in gambling debts at a 
number of Nevada casinos, including the obligations to the Golden Nugget and 
the Edgewater. 
</P>
<P>
Ely denied having the debts, saying that he owed less than $20,000 in gambling 
obligations and that he was more than able to repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their Simi Valley house, Ely said, he and his wife, Ingrid, 
owned a half interest in a condominium in Hawaii and in late 1989 purchased a 
new Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
But Ely's assurances about his economic well-being contrasted sharply with 
statements he made in legal documents and in letters addressed to Milton Frank, 
casino manager at the Golden Nugget. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Nov. 1, 1989, Ely wrote that he and his wife had both 
suffered back injuries in the January, 1989, car accident. He said he had paid 
more than $40,000 in medical expenses and damages because his insurance company 
refused to pay. As a result, "we have fallen behind in our obligations, in 
spite of doing all possible to simply meet living expenses," Ely wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He stated that he planned to pay the Golden Nugget with money he expected to 
receive from the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated July 31, 1989, Ely apologized to Frank for not being able to 
meet with him to discuss his gambling debts because of his wife's back surgery. 
The letter also indicated that Ely was a frequent visitor to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I had planned on a trip to your casino, as is my monthly custom, on the last 
weekend," Ely wrote. "My wife was rushed into emergency back surgery . . . and 
the trip was obviously impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Ely again referred to his financial troubles in the formal answer he filed 
April 3 to the Golden Nugget's court complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant prays that the court take judicial notice of the fact the 
defendant is indigent . . ." Ely wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In the same document, Ely asserted that he went to the Golden Nugget to settle 
his debts but instead the casino lured him into more gambling. He said he was 
under heavy medication for injuries he suffered in the car accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The plaintiffs," Ely's statement said, "induced the defendant to stay at their 
establishment by providing complimentary room, meals and large volumes of 
alcoholic beverages . . . causing, due to the medical condition, the defendant 
to be confronted with gaming at a time when the plaintiffs knew, or should have 
known, of the defendant's mental state of mind and inability . . . to 
reasonably exercise good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Ely said later that the letters he wrote to Frank accurately reflected his 
financial condition at the time they were written, but that he was no longer in 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, it was disclosed that the Elys were being sued by Simi Valley 
Bank for $17,500 in outstanding debts, which included unpaid credit card bills 
and personal loans. A judge later ordered Ely to repay the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Ely admitted that he owed the bank money and had been unable to repay it 
because of the accident. "There is not anything that anybody can look at and 
say we're morally corrupt because we're suffering from economic hardship," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Ely was drawn into the controversy on April 26, when the district 
attorney's office announced that it was investigating whether she had charged 
the Moorpark College Alumni Assn. for trips that her husband also had charged 
to the district. 
</P>
<P>
According to college district records, Ingrid Ely, president of the alumni 
association, charged about $2,100 to the organization's account for trips that 
she took with her husband to community college conventions in 1988 and 1989. In 
February, she charged the alumni association $975 for a trip she took to a 
convention in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Ely said her travel expenses were legitimate and had been approved by 
Moorpark College officials. She said most of the alumni association's money 
came from membership dues, not public funds. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Ely finished last in a field of five candidates vying for a county 
supervisor seat. He also became the subject of a recall campaign by a Simi 
Valley citizens group that wanted to remove him from his trustee post. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Citizens to Recall James (Tom) Ely accused him of "fiscal 
irresponsibility and unprofessional conduct." Trustee Greg Cole joined in the 
call for Ely's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Vivienne Lewis, treasurer of the citizens group, said in a recent interview 
that it had collected about half of the 9,901 signatures of registered voters 
in the 4th District needed to force a recall election. The district includes 
Simi Valley, Moorpark and Somis. 
</P>
<P>
The group has until Oct. 25 to gather the necessary signatures, county election 
officials said. If the group is successful, the Board of Trustees will be 
required to call a special election in the spring.

Geraldo Rivera made the ambush interview famous. 
</P>
<P>
He'd run after some poor sap, cameras rolling, badgering him with accusatory 
questions. The suspect, er, subject would take on the glazed expression of a 
deer caught in a car's headlights. If the pursued was silly enough to stop 
running, Rivera would gleefully confront the man, going for the jugular with 
every question. 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) reporter Marti Emerald is no Geraldo. However, judging by the 
"10News Troubleshooter Special," airing at 10 p.m. today, her new career 
ambition is to be the Geraldo of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The special is a collection of Emerald's "Troubleshooter" segments (previously 
aired on Channel 10's newscasts) interspersed with a "consumer quiz," shopping 
tips and tests of products. It was taped in front of a live audience, making it 
a direct descendant of "Fight Back!" (David Horowitz's popular syndicated 
consumer show), not to mention the "I'm mad as hell" studio atmosphere of the 
old and scary "Morton Downey Show." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the studio audience seems superfluous. Though representatives of 
various law enforcement agencies are on hand to impart useful information about 
how to avoid scams, the studio audience adds little to the show, beyond 
answering quiz questions and giving the program a populist touch, seemingly 
obligatory for this type of show. 
</P>
<P>
The real star of the program is the ambush interview. Emerald uses it with 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening segment, a rerun of a feature about a Long Beach church that 
appears to exist for no other reason than to raise money, she confronts a man 
while he is drinking his morning coffee at home. Later, she chases a church 
representative down an alley. 
</P>
<P>
Even Geraldo occasionally attempted to control his excitement at cornering his 
prey. Emerald can't resist sarcasm. She stops just short of winking at the 
camera. When a subject says he can't talk to her, she says, "Ah, gee, that's 
too bad." 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion, the producers show Emerald attempting to coax 
subjects into talking in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise I don't bite," she tells a doctor, who didn't want to come out from 
behind a curtain. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to understand why someone would try to hide from Emerald. This 
type of reporting can easily turn into trial by camera. Anyone would be 
startled to find a television reporter and camera on their doorstep in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
An innocent person can look extremely guilty running away from a TV news crew. 
The theory that someone with nothing to hide would gladly speak to a reporter 
is grossly unfair. A person has a right not to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
The titillating and sensational aspects of ambush journalism are hard to deny. 
</P>
<P>
From an audience's perspective, it is fascinating to watch a subject cringe at 
the sight of a camera. With the videotape rolling, they squirm and fidget, and 
the audience feels as if they are part of the kill, reacting with the same 
"Yeah, get the bum" attitude that makes shows like "Cops" a voyeuristic thrill. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there is something unsettling about television news acting as judge and 
jury. It decides when to show somebody in an embarrassing situation, who to 
ambush and who to treat in a mannerly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Emerald's version is equally disconcerting. Her expression and vocal tone often 
seems to say, "Hey, we all know what's really going on here." 
</P>
<P>
There's an awkward feeling that the ironic twist, the slam is more important 
than getting to the truth. In one segment, a VCR, undamaged except for a 
shorted $1.50 fuse, is taken to several repair shops. The knife is slid in when 
the shops give a wide range of estimates, some close to $100, to repair the 
VCR. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheers. But since when is an estimate proof that the shops would have 
actually charged that much? A repairman may have estimated the repair at $75, 
but he might have found the real problem and solved it inexpensively. 
</P>
<P>
That may not have made for great television, but it certainly was a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The special does demonstrate some examples of consumer reporting at its best, 
and it does shows that there is a place for aggressive consumer reports in 
television news. Channel 10 is the only station in town really doing it with 
any consistency and authority. 
</P>
<P>
In the special, which moves at a rapid-fire pace, the station effectively 
demonstrates how some recyclers in town are shortchanging customers by 
misweighing bags of aluminum cans. When the Channel 10 crew accompanies an 
undercover sting operation on home-improvement contractors, it dramatically 
illustrates a problem and tells people what they should beware of when dealing 
with unlicensed contractors. The segment lacks the sensationalism of the ambush 
technique, but it effectively makes its point. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, though, the special comes across like an advertisement for 
Channel 10 news. Several times during the show, Emerald plugs the news. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end, she introduces a taped segment on the "Troubleshooter" team, 
presenting them like heroes of the Western world. The only thing missing is the 
theme music to "The Bridge on the River Kwai." Producer J. W. August was 
introduced as "San Diego's pit bull of news," and Emerald made it clear that 
the team "solves thousands of problems a year" because Channel 10 is "committed 
to consumers in this county." 
</P>
<P>
It might be fun one day to burst into General Manager Ed Quinn's office, point 
a camera in his face (chasing him down the hall would be a nice touch), and ask 
whether the sensational and titillating aspects of consumer reporting might be 
a large part of the station's reason for that commitment.

Four blacks were killed as a power struggle raged in the Johannesburg area 
between Nelson Mandela's supporters and conservative Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
Running battles have claimed 13 lives in 12 hours. Squatter leader Prince 
Mhlabi told reporters that Zulus sniped at squatters from behind the walls of 
their compound. Mhlabi linked the fighting to opposition by supporters of Zulu 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha movement to the prominence of 
African National Congress leader Mandela, who is Xhosa. More than 100 people 
have died in 10 days of nationwide fighting.

BELGIANS DOUBT STORY THAT FOUR HOSTAGES WILL GO FREE

<P>
A Beirut newspaper said Tuesday that the radical Palestinian faction of 
terrorist Abu Nidal would release four Belgian hostages today. 
</P>
<P>
A Belgian government source dismissed the report by the newspaper al Lima, 
however, saying that "it is not the first time this paper has had a story like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, meanwhile, Swiss relief worker Elio Erriquez arrived home after what 
he described as 10 months of "living death" as a hostage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"Detention is like -- and I think I'm not exaggerating -- living death . . . . 
A dog was better than we were," he told reporters at the airport in Geneva as 
he struggled to hold back tears. 
</P>
<P>
Erriquez was handed over to Syrian security men in Muslim West Beirut late 
Monday by a group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Faction. He was 
turned over to the Swiss ambassador in Damascus early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The front-page report on the Belgians, attributed to unidentified Western 
diplomatic sources, said the four would be released today in a deal that 
includes the release of convicted Palestinian terrorist Sa'eed Nasser "by a 
special pardon signed by the king of Belgium." 
</P>
<P>
It said the deal was worked out between Belgian officials and the Revolutionary 
Council of Fatah and that a Belgian press team is to arrive in Lebanon "in the 
next few hours to cover the release of the four hostages." It did not disclose 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
The four, reported captured in 1987 aboard their boat off the Israeli-occupied 
Gaza Strip, are Emmanuel Houtekins; his wife, Godelieve Kets; their son, 
Laurent, and their daughter, Valerie.

COLD WAR: THE FAILURE OF A FREE-TRAVEL PLAN IS A REMINDER THAT ANIMOSITY

<P>
South Korea's scheme to throw open its heavily fortified border with Communist 
North Korea this week -- in a "grand inter-Korean exchange" of travelers -- 
collapsed Tuesday, with each side accusing the other of deceit. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of dialogue between the quarreling Koreas was a reminder that 
Cold War animosities remain deeply entrenched on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo had proposed that North Koreans and South 
Koreans be allowed to cross the border freely at the truce village of Panmunjom 
for five days, centering on today, the anniversary of Korea's liberation from 
Japanese rule in 1945. More than 60,000 South Koreans applied for and received 
government permission to go north, many of them to search for relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government went so far as to install a foreign exchange booth just 
south of the border, ostensibly so that visiting northerners could obtain local 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even a scaled-down version of the exchange failed to materialize. North 
Korea refused to discuss the South's demand that travelers' safety be 
guaranteed in writing. South Korea, in turn, blocked a delegation of Catholic 
priests and students from reaching Panmunjom on Tuesday to make a "working 
level" contact with northern officials. 
</P>
<P>
Today, South Korean riot police fired barrages of tear gas to block thousands 
of pro-unification demonstrators trying to march to the border. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 riot police, supported by eight armored vans equipped with tear gas 
launchers, blocked all entrances to Seoul's Yonsei University as a crowd of 
nearly 10,000 student radicals tried to march out. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of students hurling rocks and firebombs fought police at the 
university's main gate. Protesters fled for shelter as tear gas shells exploded 
over the campus. 
</P>
<P>
In central Seoul on Tuesday, police arrested about 80 participants in a 
demonstration against the American military presence. The crowd shouted "Drive 
out Yankees!" outside the U.S. 8th Army base, and a carload of the protesters 
managed to crash the main gate. South Korean riot police stationed near the 
facility quickly stopped the car and arrested the five occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul's National Unification Board charged in a statement Tuesday that the 
North's unwillingness to meet with Seoul authorities "verifies that the North 
was never interested in inter-Korean travel and exchanges, and that it still 
adheres to its long-standing strategy of unification through violent means." 
</P>
<P>
North Korea invaded the south in 1950. Although open hostilities ended in 1953, 
the two sides have remained in a tense, technical state of belligerence ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the situation between the two Germanys, political dialogue and 
humanitarian exchanges between the two Koreas have been practically nil. 
Negotiators made a breakthrough last month, when it was agreed that delegations 
led by the two prime ministers would meet for talks in Seoul starting Sept. 4, 
and again in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, starting Oct. 16. Now, 
negative fallout from this week's border-opening impasse threatens to poison 
the atmosphere for those talks, perhaps even to derail them. 
</P>
<P>
Roh, in a Liberation Day speech this morning, blamed North Korea for "putting 
forth preposterous arguments and conditions to block inter-Korean travel." He 
said that he would renew efforts to open the border later this year, and 
expressed optimism that relations could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
"Through dialogue based on mutual trust, it should also be possible to convert 
South-North military confrontation into a system of peace," Roh said. "We are 
fully prepared to discuss with the North, without limitation, all issues 
including political and military questions." 
</P>
<P>
Roh reiterated his call for a negotiated nonaggression pact, a peace treaty and 
arms control agreement. He said he hoped the meeting of prime ministers next 
month would lead to a meeting with North Korean President Kim Il Sung. He made 
no mention of the 44,000 U.S. troops still in South Korea, long a major 
stumbling block to talks with the North. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's Korea Herald, however, Roh said that U.S. 
forces have "contributed greatly to preventing the recurrence of war in this 
region," and that the military threat from the North continues to justify their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
"They can be withdrawn any time when military threats disappear," Roh said.

About 85 Tamil villagers were hacked to death Tuesday in Sri Lanka in an 
apparent retaliation for the killings of hundreds of Muslims, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 more Tamils were injured when a gang of people with knives and axes 
attacked the villages of Chenkalady and Kudurippu in the eastern Batticaloa 
district, they added. 
</P>
<P>
The residents in Batticaloa said by telephone some houses were also set ablaze. 
No further details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they thought that the killings were carried out by Muslims to 
avenge the massacres of people of their community by suspected Tamil guerrillas 
in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources and Muslim leaders said at least 387 Muslims had been hacked 
and shot to death in attacks on villages and mosques in the eastern Batticaloa 
and Amparai districts since the beginning of this month.

REBEL REPORTEDLY KILLED BY RIVALS MEETS WITH PRESS;

LIBERIA: PRINCE JOHNSON LAUGHS AT CLAIMS THAT HE WAS SLAIN BUT OPPONENTS STILL

Rivals said Tuesday that they had killed Prince Johnson, who leads one of two 
rebel factions fighting the government, but Johnson met with journalists hours 
later and laughed at the claims. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, Johnson's rival in the yearlong battle to oust President Samuel 
K. Doe, claimed Tuesday morning that his fighters had killed Johnson in an 
ambush. 
</P>
<P>
Before Johnson turned up, a man identifying himself as the rebel leader called 
the British Broadcasting Corp. in London and shouted: "Taylor's a liar! I am 
alive!" 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's spokesman and defense minister, Tom Woewiyu, announced Johnson's death 
and said the body would be exhibited. It was not. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department's daily briefing in Washington, spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler said: "We have a reliable source this morning that told us they have 
seen him today . . . alive." 
</P>
<P>
Woewiyu, asked about the call to the BBC during an interview, said that anyone 
who spoke with Johnson was "talking with a corpse." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel officers at Taylor headquarters on the Firestone rubber plantation 37 
miles southeast of Monrovia said a commander named Oliver Varney had led the 
alleged ambush. 
</P>
<P>
Woewiyu, who speaks for Taylor's National Patriotic Front, told reporters in 
Abidjan, capital of the neighboring Ivory Coast, by telephone that Johnson had 
been killed on Bushrod Island when trying to leave Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Johnson fell out three months ago in their campaign against Doe. 
Since then, each has threatened to kill the other. 
</P>
<P>
An African peacekeeping force appeared Tuesday to be facing further delays. 
</P>
<P>
Troops from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia have gathered in 
neighboring Sierra Leone, but there was no sign of an early departure. 
</P>
<P>
Woewiyu said Taylor would fly to Banjul, Gambia, this week to talk with 
President Dawda Jawara, head of an African mediation committee trying to end 
the civil war, which began Dec. 24. That seemed likely to delay arrival of the 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 100 foreigners evacuated Sunday from Liberia by the U.S. 
military began arriving in Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 27 was shuttled into Freetown by helicopter Tuesday morning 
from the carrier Saipan. U.S. officials said the rest would arrive at two-hour 
intervals.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Eastern Europe began opening its doors to foreign investors 18 months ago, 
Jan Dvorak knew there were boom days ahead here in Washington. American 
businessmen would rush to explore opportunities in places like Prague and 
Budapest; they would need visas, airline tickets, hotel reservations, 
translation services, office space. Dvorak laid on extra employees at his 
Washington-based Travisa Inc. 
</P>
<P>
That put him in the vanguard of a new American cottage industry: visa agencies, 
economic consultants, public relations firms and other service companies that 
supply logistic support and practical advice to U.S. businessmen on how to 
navigate in the unfamiliar -- often unpredictable -- waters of what used to be 
the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Firms such as Dvorak's "supply the client with information to make sure we can 
cut through the red tape," he explains. "Business went crazy at the beginning 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
To anyone who has traveled in Eastern Europe, the need for help is apparent. 
Procedures and operations that seem routine here -- from obtaining hotel rooms 
to writing a contract -- can be frustrating and time-consuming in Poland, 
Hungary or Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
And despite sweeping changes in Poland (and now, East Germany), most East 
European laws and business practices still are far different from those of most 
Western governments. 
</P>
<P>
"American business has been a lot less able and a lot less ready to go into 
business over there" than expected, says Paul Armstrong, founder of RHA 
Associates, an Irvine, Calif., company that in addition to running its own 
Soviet-based export-import business, has started hiring out its trade expertise 
to others. "But the new services should take care of that." 
</P>
<P>
Although figures are hard to come by, a new directory by Global Trade Books now 
lists more than 250 accounting, consulting, insurance, law, travel, translation 
and shipping firms with specialties in the Soviet Union alone. 
</P>
<P>
The company is planning to compile a similar directory this winter listing 
firms with East European expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms have been in the business for years. Wallace Johnson founded Summit 
Ltd., an Omaha management and consulting firm, in 1975, the heyday of detente. 
The company's clients are largely agricultural firms in both the Soviet Union 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I have personally negotiated over 30 contracts ranging from commodities, 
licensing and equipment sales to projects," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Many other companies, like Global Trade Books itself, have only recently opened 
their doors -- often with managers from widely varying backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
William S. Loiry, founder of Global Trade Books, became interested in 
U.S.-Soviet trade several years ago when he served as president of a 
sister-city project between Tallahassee, Fla., and the Soviet city of 
Krasnodar. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor of Krasnodar really emphasized the importance of trade," Loiry 
remembers. "That clicked and I decided it was something I wanted to get 
involved in." 
</P>
<P>
He reorganized his family-owned publishing business to form Global Trade Books 
and its sister consulting firm, Global Trade Enterprises, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Washington has become a magnet for many of these firms, more and more 
of them are sprouting in other areas, including California. RHA Associates 
began a year ago, after its founder, Paul Armstrong, decided to capitalize on 
his experience in negotiating two joint ventures of his own in 1989. He 
predicts that East-West trade will increase as more consulting firms come into 
being. 
</P>
<P>
Other types of firms meet other needs. 
</P>
<P>
The tortuous process of obtaining visas, for instance, has long been a source 
of jokes -- and horror stories. But it has also created a lucrative market for 
visa agencies, such as Travisa, which can shepherd the whole process, often in 
less than two days. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tremendous lines at the (Soviet) Embassy, but we know all the people 
by their first names and go there every day," Dvorak says. "It is a 
relationship we have developed over these months and years and they will do us 
favors from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the consulting businesses are betting that the new markets in the 
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe will entice more and more American companies 
each year. But already there are signs that the market may have its ups and 
downs. 
</P>
<P>
For Dvorak's Travisa, for instance, business has been down somewhat since the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year (American businessmen) went over with a lot more gay abandon," says 
Jill Catling, director of the agency's New York office. "But now they realize 
that you have to invest quite a lot of money and quite a lot of time."

SCIENCE / TRACKING TYPHOONS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHERMEN WANT STORMS TO EYE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Russell Elsberry is hoping for a little stormy weather. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at least half a dozen typhoons would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
Elsberry, a meteorologist with the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, 
Calif., is technical director of the most comprehensive meteorological 
experiment ever carried out in the Western Pacific. For two months, until the 
end of September, ships, aircraft and scientists from 12 nations will spread 
across the Pacific from Malaysia and the Philippines to the Aleutian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Their purpose will be to study every element of every typhoon that forms in 
that stormy region, and Elsberry, who will coordinate the project from Guam, 
hopes they will have plenty of chances. 
</P>
<P>
THE GOAL: Elsberry and his team hope that their data will help scientists 
better predict the exact course and strength of typhoons and hurricanes around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is no more than a 50-mile error at 24 hours," Elsberry said. That 
means that, at any given moment, the typhoon should be within 50 miles of 
wherever the scientists had said it would be 24 hours earlier. He hopes the 
error will be no more than 100 miles at 48 hours and 150 miles at 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
That's not an easy goal, he said, because, when a typhoon reaches 
mid-latitudes, where it could hit major U.S. military bases and population 
centers throughout Japan and the Philippines, "the storm can move 400 miles in 
24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
And "a hundred-mile error means millions of dollars (in damages) per mile" if 
the storm hits where no one expected it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mainly trying to improve the 48- to 72-hour forecast," Elsberry said, 
"because that's when you've got to move aircraft and ships" to get them out of 
harm's way before the storm strikes. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROBLEMS: Every typhoon that develops in the area is to be tracked by 
aircraft that fly through its eye, by ships that remain a safe distance from 
the storm center and by satellites that will monitor its moisture content and 
its direction. 
</P>
<P>
Satellites alone cannot do the job. Sometimes the top of a storm will sheer off 
and move in one direction while the lower part rips along the surface in a 
different direction. The satellite tracks the upper part, because the clouds at 
higher altitudes are cooler and show up more strongly in infrared data 
collected by the orbiting spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is possible for forecasters to wake up in the morning after following 
satellite data all evening and find their storm 200 or 300 miles away from 
where they thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
The project will use seven ships -- four Soviet vessels, which mainly will 
study water temperatures and other oceanographic features, plus two from Japan 
and one from the United States. Research aircraft will include a National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration DC-8 that is a veteran of many storms and 
has even flown through parts of the ozone hole in the atmosphere, a U.S. Air 
Force C-130 that will fly through the eye of the typhoons and a Soviet research 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
At least 100 people in the United States alone will take part, including 25 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"It has turned into an enormous experiment," Elsberry said. U.S. participation 
is expected to cost around $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTLOOK: "My biggest nightmare is if we gave a typhoon party and no 
typhoons showed up," Elsberry said. But he does not expect to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Western Pacific has the greatest number of typhoons in the world," he 
said. "It's the best place in the world to do this study. Half the typhoons in 
the world form there." 
</P>
<P>
During the 60 days of the study, "we hope to get eight typhoons," he added. 
Data from the research project will be pumped into the National Meteorological 
Center's supercomputer in Washington, and it will be available to all nations.

U.N. COMMAND MAY BE REVIVED TO ENFORCE SANCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: BUSH SEEMS COOL TO THE IDEA, BUT ACTIVATING THE COMMITTEE COULD EASE 
CRITICISM OF THE U.S.

<P>
Bush Administration officials, determined to frame the Persian Gulf crisis as a 
confrontation of Iraq against the rest of the world, met with key members of 
the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to discuss reviving a 
long-dormant U.N. military command to enforce economic sanctions against 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed by the Soviet Union, could launch the first fighting force 
under the U.N. flag since the Korean War and produce joint U.S.-Soviet military 
operations for the first time since the closing days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt met at the State Department for almost 
an hour with ambassadors and other top diplomats from the Soviet Union, 
Britain, France and China -- the other four permanent Security Council members 
-- to discuss activating the U.N. Military Staff Committee. The committee would 
coordinate the activities of a growing international armada in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the discussions are at an 
early stage. She said representatives of the five nations will meet again soon 
in New York to continue the talks. No date was set. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze suggested 
using the U.N. body last week in a telephone conversation with Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III. She said Baker decided to bring in other Security 
Council members after discussing the plan several times with Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the State Department's initiative, President Bush seemed cool to the 
idea during a late-afternoon news conference Tuesday. Talking to reporters 
about a half-hour after the diplomatic meeting, Bush said that he is "somewhat 
open-minded" about the plan, although the United States has ample legal 
authority to enforce the embargo on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was raised to Jim Baker by Shevardnadze and I don't have any 
objection, any problem, with talking to the Soviets about that," Bush said. "I 
think it would be a very good thing to have an active Soviet presence to 
enforce these U.N. resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I don't think it is essential that you have a U.N. flag . . . 
for countries to carry out their responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments suggest that the plan has both attractions and drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest plus is that it could prevent the gulf crisis from degenerating 
into a U.S.-Iraq confrontation and assure much wider international 
participation. Also, the plan could quiet the grumbling of some U.N. members, 
including the Soviet Union and France, that the United States is overstepping 
its authority by taking on enforcement of U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the plan would place U.S. forces -- by far the largest contingent in 
the gulf -- under an international command, something Washington has been 
traditionally reluctant to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pentagon may not be quite ready to hand over 100,000 men they got to the 
area at great effort and expense to the command of some Swedish general," one 
official at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said. "There's also the 
problem of once you turn on this mechanism, how do you stop it?" 
</P>
<P>
When forces under the U.N. flag fought the Korean War, they were under the 
command of American officers. But no one thinks that Washington would be able 
to dominate the process this time. 
</P>
<P>
After the Korean War, the U.N. Military Staff Committee was created. Its 
chairmanship rotates each month. A Soviet general is in charge this month, a 
British officer will take over next month and U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Carl R. 
Smith will be in the chair in October. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the committee has wide powers under the U.N. Charter to "command 
forces placed at the disposal of the (Security) Council." The committee meets 
secretly every two weeks, but it has never been used to command troops because 
the Security Council has never been able to agree on what it should do. 
</P>
<P>
During an unofficial meeting of the Security Council in New York on Monday, 
officials of France, Canada and the Soviet Union raised questions about the 
legality of Washington's unilateral decision to "interdict" ships trading with 
Iraq. Although the three nations, all of which have their own ships in the 
gulf, did not press the issue, they made it clear that they would prefer to act 
under U.N. auspices. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler insisted that U.S. interest in activating the U.N. committee has 
nothing to do with the criticism. Nevertheless, drawing the committee into the 
operation would seem to quiet complaints. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, France said that it is implementing all agreed-upon measures to 
stop trade with Iraq but that it would join U.S. and British warships in 
intercepting oil tankers and other merchant ships only if the Security Council 
authorizes the operation, Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union said earlier that it would participate in a blockade only 
under U.N. auspices. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said last week that some sort of coordinating mechanism would be required 
if the international warships in the gulf hope to work together on something as 
complex as a naval blockade. Baker's plan to use the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization for that purpose was rebuffed by other NATO foreign ministers. 
However, the U.N. committee would seem to fill that requirement equally well. 
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Bush said the most remarkable element of the gulf 
crisis so far has been the close cooperation of the United States and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it this way: Suppose we set the clock back five years . . . and we 
had an event of this nature in the Middle East. The major unknown and the major 
area of concern would have been, how would the Soviets react? . . . What action 
are the Soviets apt to take?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, today, we don't have that concern because they have joined in the United 
Nations in condemning this aggression. And that's a significant difference . . 
. ."

MOBILIZING OF RESERVES A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY, DEFENSE CHIEF HINTS

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday that no decision has been made to 
call up more reservists because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, but he 
hinted that it is a distinct possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that some National Guardsmen already are helping transport troops to 
Saudi Arabia, he added: "With so many people going overseas, somebody is going 
to have to take those places here in this country." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the military relies on reservists for some specialized 
skills that may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically if the reservists are going to be mobilized, Cheney said 
that no decision has been made "in terms of an overall call-up of the reserve 
units." He noted that the President has the authority to call up 200,000 
personnel for 90 days, and that could be extended 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney added: "The fact of the matter is we have over the years built a very 
heavy reliance on reserve units into our forces. The concept that Congress has 
pursued in prior administrations is that certain key functions would be 
performed or assigned primarily to reserve or guard units. 
</P>
<P>
"The result is, for example, when you start to look for medical personnel, 
you'll find an awful lot of those are reservists. The way you fill that kind of 
need, in the event of a major deployment like this, is to call upon those 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that some reservists were used in the invasion of Panama, adding: 
"Lots of times we are able to do it on a volunteer basis. Just send out a 
notice we need so many people of a certain type of skill, and in a relatively 
small operation, that's adequate."

KUWAIT DIARY: SHOCK LINGERS EVEN AFTER THE SMOKE CLEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MALLETT, FINANCIAL TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victor Mallett, a correspondent for the Financial Times in London, was in 
Kuwait city at the time of the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2 and kept a diary. He 
escaped Monday and filed this personal account. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 2 -- Iraq invades Kuwait before dawn, taking the population completely by 
surprise despite the collapse of negotiations between the two countries in 
Jidda the day before. People are still commuting to work in the city center 
hours after Iraq forces had crossed the border and taken the capital. 
</P>
<P>
I am among thousands of civilians caught in the fighting, and I am kept under 
guard out in the open by Iraq soldiers before being released. At first it seems 
that Kuwaiti troops have only fought back in the city center, particularly at 
the royal palaces of the ousted Sabah family, but the burned-out tanks and 
armored cars I saw later in Jahra area to the west show that there were battles 
outside the capital as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis are shocked and can hardly believe that their country has been 
overrun. Some of them assume that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is simply 
making a show of force to extort money from Kuwait. Thousands of foreign 
workers from the Arab world, Asia and the West are also caught unawares and 
trapped in Kuwait. "It's chaos," said one British diplomat during the morning 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day a radio broadcast on an unfamiliar wavelength claims that the 
free provisional government has overthrown Sheik Jabbar, the emir, and invited 
the Iraqis. No one believes it, and those suspicions are later confirmed by 
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti television airwaves are still in the hands of the old 
regime, and the television broadcasts an appeal for resistance by Sheik Saad, 
the crown prince. "They have come to kill the sons of Kuwait and its women," he 
says. "Our patriotic army is repelling the aggression. Kuwaitis should stand 
behind them." In fact, the army has all but fled, and the television is 
apparently broadcasting from a secret location, although isolated pockets of 
resistance will continue to trouble the Iraqis for several days to come. 
</P>
<P>
Senior members of the ruling family have escaped to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 3 -- Iraqi troops consolidate their hold on the country, but resistance 
continues and there is further fighting both at the emir's Dasman Palace and at 
the military barracks near Shuwaikh. Near the conference center for the Gulf 
Cooperation Council, we see three shot-up Iraqi pickups which have evidently 
just been ambushed. Four corpses lie by the roadside. The Iraqis appear to have 
chosen the Sheraton Hotel as their headquarters, and they position tanks along 
the sea front next to Arabian Gulf Street. Residential areas are largely left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad Radio announces that the new government, declaring the Sabahs to be 
corrupt, has confiscated all their wealth, but there is still no indication as 
to who is in the new leadership. They later turn out to be Iraqis.

Some shops, including the Sultan Centre supermarket, are open by the afternoon, 
and only milk and bread are in short supply. Queues form at petrol stations, 
and muezzin call the faithful to Friday prayers from the mosque minarets. 
Kuwaitis are still stunned by the Iraqi attack. "They cannot just do this, even 
if they oppose the Kuwaiti government," says one civil servant. "A country has 
its dignity." 
</P>
<P>
International telecommunications are cut in the evening, although telex lines 
to Saudi Arabia function intermittently until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 4 -- The fiasco of the Iraqi-imposed government becomes more pronounced. 
Kuwaitis scoff at the fact that their supposed new leaders have not shown their 
faces and that the announcers of the new Iraqi-controlled TV station speak in 
Iraqi accents and do not know how to wear the ghutra -- the traditional Kuwaiti 
headdress. Even Kuwaitis with grievances against the royal family are now 
completely alienated by Iraq's crude propaganda. "I think this is nonsense," 
says one Kuwaiti newspaper publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The first reports of looting -- later to be confirmed -- surface in Kuwait. 
Residents say the gold souk (market) has been ransacked, although it is not 
clear who did it. Civilians mount a resistance campaign in the Keifan district 
of the capital. The Iraqis, meanwhile, have opened prison gates, apparently 
taking away a group of Kuwaiti Shiite Muslims convicted of bombing Western 
embassies. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time there is an eyewitness report of Westerners being driven 
away in buses by the Iraqis. Frenzied shoppers continue to empty the shelves of 
the Sultan Centre. Tinned foods -- except for quail's eggs -- are running out, 
but cherries from the U.S. and cabbages from Holland are still available. I am 
astonished when the cashier accepts my credit card and gives me tickets for a 
lucky draw. Such is the unreality of war. The prize for the draw, a car, was 
later stolen. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon a helicopter circles around the Holiday Inn hotel where guests 
with nothing to do and nowhere to go sunbathe by the pool. Even after the 
fighting began, the hotel's telex machine cheerfully and automatically answers 
back to desperate callers: "Welcome to a new age of elegance." 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 5 -- Resistance continues. I and some colleagues have to stop our car and 
dive for cover as gunfire is exchanged across the main road. From where we lie 
in the dust, it seems that resistance forces are attacking a passing Iraqi 
convoy. Such ambushes seem to be common. Just beyond the shooting, an Iraqi 
soldier flags us down and asks, over-optimistically, for whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Iraq graffiti is now widespread. Kuwaiti flags and pictures of Sheiks 
Jabbar and Saad are plastered over road signs and hung from bridges. The 
Holiday Inn, however, decides that discretion is the better part of valor and 
finally takes down the pictures of the two sheiks in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 6 -- Confusion reigns. Embassies -- sometimes without telephones -- are 
struggling to find out how many of their citizens are in the country during the 
summer holidays. Some embassies are having problems with their short-wave 
transmitters, which they use to keep in contact with their capitals. A 7 p.m. 
to 7 a.m. curfew has been declared, but many Kuwaitis ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 7 -- Refugees continue to head for the border with Saudi Arabia, but it is 
closed. We encounter a washing machine which has fallen off a vehicle in the 
middle lane of the highway to Al Salmy in the west. We are turned back by an 
Iraqi roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
More looting is reported in the city center, and there are reports that ration 
cards are being issued in some areas. The days are becoming quieter, but 
resistance fighters continue to snipe at the Iraqis by night. Soldiers at 
roadblocks are friendly. At least one reported rape is confirmed by diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
A resistance leaflet appears calling Saddam Hussein "The Hitler of the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 8 -- During the night, Kuwaitis have assembled on rooftops and shouted 
defiance at the Iraqis together with cries of "God is great!" They are 
encouraged by the belief that their demonstration will be seen by American spy 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
I meet a resistance leader, a younger member of the Sabah family, who says: "We 
have a political and military undercover structure now. We are in contact with 
our leadership outside." He says the Iraqi soldiers have been fed lies about a 
supposed Israeli attack on Kuwait which they have come to beat back. The 
38-year-old man, part of an amateurish but courageous anti-Iraqi network, says: 
"My place is in Kuwait. Saddam Hussein will leave, whether by force or 
voluntarily. It may be today, tomorrow or in a month's time, but he will 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
The resistance is urging people not to report to work and to ignore the 
Iraqi-controlled media. "We are not taking too many prisoners," says the 
resistance leader I meet. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 9 -- The Iraqis force shopkeepers to accept that one Iraqi dinar offered 
by a soldier is equivalent to one Kuwaiti dinar, although before the invasion 
one Kuwaiti dinar was worth 10 Iraqi dinars on the free market. The Iraqis are 
buying everything from cans of Pepsi to tea cups to take home to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi army is beginning to dig in to defensive positions in Kuwait. The 
soldiers are filling sandbags or sitting under beach umbrellas and makeshift 
shelters in the heat of the day at their seaside bivouacs. Most of Kuwait's 
Egyptian population has come down firmly on the side of the West and the former 
Kuwaiti regime, but Palestinians are divided. Many of them resented the 
arrogance of Kuwaitis and their refusal to grant citizenship to Palestinians 
who had lived in the country all their lives. Palestinians also see Saddam 
Hussein as a strong leader who stands up for their rights against Israel and 
the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 10 -- Iraq has ordered embassies to move to Baghdad, further raising fears 
among foreigners about their protection. Travelers see large missiles -- 
possibly Scud-Bs or upgraded Scuds -- on the road to the south. Some residents 
have also seen face-masks and mobile equipment which appears to be for 
decontamination after a chemical attack. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are increasingly afraid of the possibility of chemical war, although 
the immediate horizon is clouded by the possibility that they may be used as 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 11 -- Women demonstrate outside the Rumasiya Mosque. Four resistance 
fighters are said to have been killed in an attack upon Iraqi positions. Iraqi 
soldiers are becoming increasingly nervous and no longer sit relaxed by the 
roadside or in their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 12 -- A Briton is reported to have been shot while trying to escape over 
the Saudi border. There are increasing reports of desertions and mutiny among 
the Iraqi troops. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most Iraqi tanks and heavy equipment have now left the city center and seem to 
be concentrated at Jahra, which gives easy access in all directions. A diplomat 
sees a group of Iraqi civilians being bused in for a pro-Iraqi demonstration 
which will later be shown on Iraqi television. The city is looking increasingly 
shabby, even if the damage from the fighting is not extensive. Damaged vehicles 
and garbage litter the once-immaculate streets. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 13 -- I escape with friends.

Five environmental and community groups went to court Tuesday to block the 
resettlement of Love Canal, one day before a state agency planned to start 
showing homes near the notorious chemical dump to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The groups said they wanted a state judge to enforce his 1985 injunction 
barring resettlement of the neighborhood in Niagara Falls until an 
environmental impact statement was completed. 
</P>
<P>
No hearing was scheduled because the judge was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Resettlement may subject human beings to a serious health risk, such as 
mutagenic diseases and death," said Joanne Hale of the Commission for Racial 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
The Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency said it had asked the same judge, 
state Supreme Court Justice Joseph Mintz, to lift the 1985 injunction. And the 
state attorney general's office, which asked Mintz to impose the injunction 
five years ago, said it would not object to the agency's request. 
</P>
<P>
The revitalization agency planned to start showing 10 houses north and 
northwest of the chemical-filled canal bed to prospective buyers today and to 
start accepting bids for them on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The judge is not due back until early September, said Richard J. Lippes, 
attorney for the environmental groups. Lippes said he would consider asking 
another judge to hear the case if the agency plans to actually start selling 
houses before Mintz returns.

12 GUARDS HURT AS INMATES REBEL OVER STAFF'S BLOCKADE OF N.Y. JAIL

Prisoners angered by a two-day guards' blockade of the city's giant Rikers 
Island jail complex erupted in violence Tuesday night, injuring at least 12 
guards and an undetermined number of inmates, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbance occurred shortly before 6:30 p.m., just before a settlement was 
announced in the blockade by the guards, who were protesting the earlier 
beating of a guard by prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The job action had kept hundreds of prisoners from making court appearances and 
thousands of workers from going home. 
</P>
<P>
As word of the disturbance spread, many of the guards who had taken part in the 
protest got into their cars and headed for the prison dormitory where it was 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
A captain for the Correction Department, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity, said the inmates had clubs and knives. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to gas them," he said. "They came at us with homemade knives. They had 
broken up the bed frames. They were just fed up and they knew there weren't too 
many of us, and that we were tired." 
</P>
<P>
The injuries included tear gas inhalation, stab wounds and bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
When the settlement was announced, a spokesman for the Correction Captains 
Assn., Joseph Dike, said the bridge leading to the island would be cleared as 
soon as the agreement's details were on paper. 
</P>
<P>
City officials met with union leaders to negotiate a peaceful end to the 
blockade.

U.S. SUES FIRM OVER ASBESTOS REMOVAL ON SHIP

<P>
A ship repair company and its president have been charged with improperly 
removing asbestos from an aircraft carrier, potentially endangering hundreds of 
sailors as well as their own employees. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office, which filed the charges Monday against California 
Marine Commercial Insulation Inc. and its president and owner, Frank Chavez, 
contends that the firm knowingly failed to ensure that workers took proper 
precautions when they removed more than 260 feet of pipes covered with dry, 
crumbling asbestos from the carrier Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators and some employees allege that workers wore no protective 
clothing, tore out asbestos while sailors were present, toted dust-laden pipes 
through bunk and kitchen areas and piled loose asbestos in dumpsters, all in 
violation of federal asbestos removal laws. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez has denied any wrongdoing and said that all the work aboard the aircraft 
carrier was done properly. 
</P>
<P>
The charges sprang from an eight-month investigation by the Naval Investigative 
Service, which had received complaints from CMCI employees. The case will be 
the first of its kind in the nation to be controlled by new federal sentencing 
guidelines, said Melanie Pierson, assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego. A 
guilty verdict could result in a $25,000 fine and a six-month jail term.

MEDICINE AIDS TREATMENT;

ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT THERAPY SHOWING PROMISE IN TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A form of ultraviolet light therapy that has been successful in treating 
patients with a rare skin cancer is showing early promise as an experimental 
AIDS therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Four of five patients with AIDS-related complex treated in a preliminary trial 
had decreased symptoms and improved immune system function, according to an 
article in today's Annals of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In laboratory experiments, the treatments have been shown to kill the AIDS 
virus directly and to stimulate the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some encouraging results. . . . The data definitely needs to be 
corroborated," said Dr. Emil Bisaccia, a dermatologist at Morristown Memorial 
Hospital in northern New Jersey and the principal author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
Bisaccia said that 15 additional patients are now receiving the expensive 
monthly treatments. There have been no serious short-term side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"The first patient treated, a homosexual man who before treatment was able to 
walk up a flight of stairs only with difficulty, is now capable of jogging 3.5 
miles a day and lifting weights," the report said. Two other participants "are 
now attending college and working full time." 
</P>
<P>
The findings are difficult to interpret because so few patients were treated 
and because there was no control group of untreated patients, a standard 
research procedure in tests of the effectiveness of new therapies. The 
researchers may also have been biased in their interpretation of the patients' 
responses to therapy, according to an editorial by Dr. Elias Abrutyn, an 
associate editor of the medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
Abrutyn wrote that the article was published, despite such "substantial 
questions," to stimulate additional independent investigations and because 
"AIDS is a calamitous illness for which we need additional therapies." 
</P>
<P>
The treatments, known as "extracorporeal photopheresis," are approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a skin cancer of T-4 lymphocytes, 
the same white blood cells that are attacked by the AIDS virus. The tumor is 
called "cutaneous T-cell lymphoma." 
</P>
<P>
During the treatments, which are administered on two consecutive days once a 
month, the patient ingests 8-methoxypsoralen, a light-activated anti-cancer 
drug. Then, small amounts of the patient's blood are removed from the body, and 
the white blood cells and plasma, the liquid portion of the blood, are 
separated. The red blood cells are returned to the body. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a pint of white blood cells and plasma is collected, the 
mixture is passed as a thin film through a sterile irradiation chamber, where 
it is exposed to high-dose ultraviolet light. The process takes three hours. 
Then the mixture is transfused back into the patient. 
</P>
<P>
It is not certain how the treatments work against cancer or might work against 
the AIDS virus. When activated by light, the drug can bind to the DNA in 
chromosomes, damaging the cells and interfering with their ability to 
reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
A leading theory is that abnormal T-cells are selectively targeted by 
photopheresis and then recognized and destroyed by the immune system when they 
are returned to the body. 
</P>
<P>
The treatments may be killing AIDS virus particles as well as "jump-starting 
the immune system," said Dr. Albert S. Klainer, another author of the study. 
Four of the first five AIDS-related complex patients to receive the therapy 
have continued with monthly therapies for as long as 19 months, Bisaccia said. 
One patient, who was judged to have improved, dropped out of the study after 
five months.

SARA SEEGAR; HAD REGULAR ROLE IN 'DENNIS THE MENACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Sara Seegar, who portrayed Mrs. Wilson on the television series "Dennis 
the Menace" and characters created by Oscar Wilde and Richard Sheridan on and 
off Broadway, has died in a hospital in Langhorne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
She was 76, lived in nearby Newtown and died Sunday of a cerebral hemorrhage, 
said her husband, actor Ezra Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Seegar appeared as a character actress on Broadway and in London, on radio 
and television and as one of the town ladies in the movie version of "The Music 
Man." 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis the Menace" was broadcast from 1959 to 1963. Miss Seegar played the 
second Mrs. Wilson from 1962 to 1963 after the actor playing the first Mr. 
Wilson, a curmudgeonly neighbor, died and was replaced by Gale Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963 she was seen in Sheridan's "School for Scandal" and in the musical 
"Earnest in Love," based on the characters Oscar Wilde created in "The 
Importance of Being Earnest." She also appeared for many seasons at the Bucks 
County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa., and co-produced with her husband a 1983 
tricentennial salute to Newtown, "Sweet Land." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, she had been active in training young actors through the American 
College Theater Festival, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the 
music and theater department of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, she had been heard often on radio, particularly on her husband's 
popular series "The Aldrich Family."

KIMON BEAZLIE; AIDS PATIENT IN TIMES PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kimon Beazlie, 46, a former Hollywood costume designer who with four other AIDS 
patients was profiled Sunday in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, has died after 
a yearlong battle with the disease, according to friends. 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie, of Los Feliz, appeared on the cover of the magazine and was one of the 
subjects of an article titled "To Live and Die in L.A.," about the crisis in 
AIDS health care in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
He was admitted to the Chris Brownlie Hospice for AIDS patients two weeks ago, 
soon after giving a short, final interview for the story, and died early 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie, an avid amateur rock climber who was born and raised in Hawaii, once 
made $80,000 a year creating costumes for movies and television. 
</P>
<P>
After developing early symptoms in the fall of 1988, Beazlie became ill in July 
of last year with Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare skin cancer associated with AIDS. In 
the magazine article he told of being forced to wait seven weeks, because of 
overcrowded conditions, before being admitted to the AIDS outpatient clinic at 
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Beazlie was treated at the clinic until this summer, when he dropped out of 
therapy because of frustration with the quality of medical care and his own 
worsening condition. For several months, until his health deteriorated, he was 
a part-time volunteer at Being Alive, a nonprofit group run by AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before dying, Beazlie arranged for his own cremation. No services are 
scheduled. A friend said his remains will be flown to Hawaii, where Beazlie is 
survived by his father, Horace, and mother, Natsuko; a brother, David, and two 
sisters, Karla and Nadine.

After reviewing dozens of proposals for providing the city with emergency water 
supplies, the Santa Barbara City Council has decided on desalination to cope 
with the drought. The city will begin negotiating with a Massachusetts company 
that has proposed building the nation's largest seawater desalination plant in 
Santa Barbara, a facility expected to provide about 5,000 acre-feet of water a 
year, about one-third of the city's normal demand. If the contract with Ionics 
Inc. is approved, the city could receive water by February, 1992, said Sandra 
Lizarraga, coordinator of the city drought response programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County couple have dropped a novel lawsuit in which they claimed that 
Nissan Motor Corp. planted an automotive spy in their home to study the habits 
of middle-class Americans, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen and Maritza French of Costa Mesa told their lawyer that they did not 
want to endure the stress of pursuing the litigation. The decision was hailed 
by Nissan, which had denounced the lawsuit as groundless as soon as it was 
filed in Orange County Superior Court last December. Jon Anderson, Nissan's 
lawyer, said Takashi Morimoto had indeed been conducting market research on the 
car-buying habits of the American public, but he rented a room in the French 
family home only to study English.

STEINBRENNER'S SON ON YANKEES: 'WHO NEEDS IT?';

George Steinbrenner said on Tuesday night that his son Hank has rejected his 
request to succeed him as general partner of the New York Yankees, telling his 
father, "Who needs it?" Said Steinbrenner: "I don't blame him at all." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, when asked whom he will recommend as his successor at a meeting 
with his limited partners today, said that he didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you it is not the names being bantered around," said Steinbrenner, 
who is likely to turn to one of his limited partners as his replacement. But he 
specifically ruled out Marvin Goldklang, a limited partner, and Jack Lawn, a 
Yankee executive. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner said Hank had spurned his plea to run the team. Hank, a source in 
Tampa, Fla., said, rejected the position in part because he finds baseball 
tedious. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed up at three (minor league) games and said, 'These games are boring. 
I'm not going to do this,' " the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner hinted that he wants his other son, Harold, to run the team "in a 
few years." He considered having his son-in-law Joseph A. Molloy serve as 
general partner until Harold is ready. Molloy is the Yankees' 
secretary-treasurer. Steinbrenner has praised Molloy for organizing the 
Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa. But the source quoted Molloy as saying, 
"It was supposed to be me, but the Boss changed his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner has envisioned for the past few years that control of the Yankees, 
like a family heirloom, would pass from father to first-born son. And July 31, 
the day after baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent ruled against him, Steinbrenner 
released a statement announcing Hank's appointment as his chosen successor. But 
Hank, a 33-year-old with a love for horses, a newborn daughter and a quiet life 
in Florida, flatly refused his father's wishes to step into the vortex of a 
turbulent franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't want to do it," Steinbrenner said. "Of course, what the 
commissioner said didn't help any." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner claimed that Vincent said Hank faced a difficult task in gaining 
approval from major league owners. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hell of a thing to do," Steinbrenner said. "And then the other guy 
(baseball investigator John Dowd) saying, 'If he doesn't do exactly what the 
commissioner says, God help him.' That kind of talk from John Dowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither of those quotes helped (Hank). He just said, 'Screw it! Who needs it?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, though, hinted that he will seek an arrangement today with his 
limited partners that will ensure that his younger son, Harold, will someday be 
general partner. Harold, a senior at Williams College, is known to have a 
greater interest in baseball and the Yankees than does Hank. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting to the age now where I've had 17 years and I had hoped one son 
wanted to do it," Steinbrenner, 60, said. "But I don't blame him at all. But 
maybe the next son comes along in a few years and does it. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact that it is owned by (our) family will decide what is done and 
what isn't done. We don't have any plans to sell." 
</P>
<P>
The partners could decide to appoint Daniel McCarthy to serve as general 
partner for an interim period, perhaps five years, while Harold serves an 
apprenticeship. McCarthy, a limited partner, is Steinbrenner's longtime tax 
attorney and confidant. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what would happen in the meeting today, Steinbrenner said, "I don't 
really know." 
</P>
<P>
But when he was asked if whatever plan he decides on will be implemented, 
Steinbrenner said, "In the end it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it appears that the Yankee partnership will approve whatever plan 
Steinbrenner presents. That is because he holds a 55% interest in the team, 
which means he holds 55% of the vote. A candidate needs 67% of the vote for 
approval. Because his wife and several longtime friends hold another sizable 
chunk of the vote, Steinbrenner is virtually assured of getting what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
"That's perfectly true," one limited partner said. "There will be no palace 
revolt." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edward Rosenthal, another limited partner, "As far as I'm concerned, I'm 
behind George because his back is against the wall. He has made us all a lot of 
money. This is not the time to be fighting him. This is the time to support 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's appointed successor must clear two other obstacles after winning 
approval from the Yankee partnership. First, Vincent must give his approval to 
the candidate. Then the candidate must be approved by two-thirds of the 
American League owners (10 of the 13 other owners) and a majority of the 
National League owners (seven of 12). They are likely to vote at an owners' 
meeting Sept. 12 in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner agreed to resign his position after Vincent ruled on July 30 that 
he acted against the best interests of baseball by giving $40,000 to Howard 
Spira, a known gambler. Since then, Steinbrenner has had little contact with 
his limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, the limited partners were not certain where the meeting would be 
held. They were instructed to convene at McCarthy's office, but then disperse 
to an undisclosed location to avoid reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said that Steinbrenner may nominate Daniel Crown, a Chicago 
businessman in his 30s, or Robert Nederlander, an attorney. Crown and 
Nederlander are limited partners whose families hold the largest stake in the 
team after Steinbrenner.

NAVRATILOVA HASN'T LOST A STEP ON COURT; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: PLAYING HER FIRST MATCH SINCE WIMBLEDON, SHE NEEDS ONLY 48 MINUTES TO 
DEFEAT GRAHAM IN L.A. TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Here is how it has been going for Martina Navratilova lately: 
</P>
<P>
 -- She wins Wimbledon a record ninth time, but is stunned when Margaret Court, 
one of her idols, unloads on her in the media, criticizing her lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She vacations in Antigua, but catches the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She steps on the tennis court in San Diego, but strains her Achilles' 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She stays with friends in Sherman Oaks, but her cat, Guinevere, runs away. 
A cat-napping? No, Guinevere returns on her own. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it has been like one step forward and two steps back for Navratilova, 
who always seems to bounce back. And why is that? 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Open is around the corner," she said. "It's immediate and very 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova waited five weeks to play her first match since Wimbledon, then 
took 48 minutes to win it on a gray Tuesday afternoon at Manhattan Country Club 
in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that she might have forgotten how to play, Navratilova found that it 
all came back quickly. She defeated 19-year-old Stanford student Debbie Graham 
of Fountain Valley, 6-1, 6-2, then pronounced herself on schedule for the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
But first, there was a little nervousness, Navratilova admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to remember how to pack my bag," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Sabatini and Zina Garrison won their first matches. Sabatini defeated 
Halle Cioffi, 6-2, 6-0, and Zina Garrison defeated Bettina Fulco, 6-0, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison's victory was stalled momentarily when Sam, a 13-week old Labrador 
retriever, ran on the court. Play was stopped with Garrison serving until Sam's 
owner, Nancy Bolger of Virginia Slims, collared him. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, the NCAA singles champion, is majoring in two fields at Stanford, 
political science and economics, both certain to come in handy in professional 
tennis. But there was nothing that prepared her to play Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, Navratilova's quick movements indicated that she was fully 
recovered from the Achilles' tendon she injured before the Great American Bank 
tournament in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova pulled out of that event, thus missing a chance to play No. 
1-ranked Steffi Graf.Navratilova laughed when she was asked if she had ducked 
playing Graf on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"Right, I didn't want to play Steffi, so I just pretended I was hurt," she 
said. "That's just preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Also somewhat hard to believe is how little impact her record Wimbledon title 
has had. The net result: Zero. But Navratilova sort of expected that. 
</P>
<P>
"Things don't happen that fast," she said. "I'm not exactly a new face. I had 
to laugh when the TV announcers said if Agassi wins the French Open, how many 
millions it would be worth to him." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Navratilova is choosy about her endorsements. She won't do chewing gum 
or soft drinks, saying, "Kids have too much sugar as it is." 
</P>
<P>
But she did a great-looking endorsement for the New Yorker magazine, a two-page 
spread in Vanity Fair in which Navratilova reads the magazine while high above 
Aspen on a ski lift. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really want to do is American Express . . . 'Do you know me?' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Wimbledon, everybody does -- again. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Is this the (dollar) sign of success? Monica Seles, cashing in on her French 
Open championship, has signed a three-year racket endorsement deal with Yonex 
worth an estimated $2 million-plus. Seles, who has been using a Prince, will 
play her first match with a Yonex when she faces 18-year-old Audra Keller 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Joe Fernandez did not play at Wimbledon because of a knee injury and is 
warming up for the year's last Grand Slam event, the U.S. Open, by entering 
exactly one tournament -- this one. Fernandez, who turns 19 Sunday, won her 
first match Tuesday, defeating Claudine Toleafoa of New Zealand, 6-2, 6-2. If 
one tournament isn't much hardcourt preparation for the U.S. Open, at least 
Fernandez isn't the only player with the same strategy -- Martina Navratilova 
ended up doing the same when injury forced her out of the San Diego event. But 
Fernandez expects Navratilova to be prepared nonetheless. "She must feel so 
confident now (because) winning a Grand Slam (event) has got to give you all 
the confidence in the world," Fernandez said. "All she needs are a couple of 
matches here and she'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Patty Fendick was forced to retire in her match against Keller, trailing, 6-3, 
1-1. Fendick pulled a muscle in her leg.

Alex English, the eighth-leading scorer in NBA history, will sign a free-agent 
contract with the Dallas Mavericks to fill the hole left by Sam Perkins' 
departure to the Lakers, the team said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to get him," Maverick Coach Richie Adubato said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll take up some of the scoring punch with Perkins gone." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said English would get a one-year contract with an option for a second 
year and that it would be worth more than $1 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
English, 36, played in 80 games for the Denver Nuggets and averaged 17.9 points 
and 3.6 rebounds despite diminished playing time last season. 
</P>
<P>
His 17.9 average marked the first time in 10 years he had averaged under 22 
points.

A planned boycott of this week's LPGA Big Apple tournament in New Rochelle,

Wykagyl Country Club would speed efforts to recruit blacks.

Milwaukee Buck guard Alvin Robertson was charged with misdemeanor assault and 
jailed in the reported beating of his wife in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's wife, Jacquelin, told Bexar County sheriff's investigators that she 
refused to let her husband in their house after he returned home from a trip 
with another woman. Robertson went to the back of the house and smashed a 
window to get in, police said. He then followed his wife upstairs and later to 
the garage, where he grabbed her hand "and struck it against the concrete 
floor," according to police.

<P>
RUSSELLS' SIDEKICK MAPS MAKE THOSE HARD-TO-FIND SPOTS EASIER TO REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In southeast California, there are tank tracks where U.S. Army troops prepared 
for desert combat. 
</P>
<P>
Those soldiers never heard of Saddam Hussein. Their minds were on German Field 
Marshal Erwin Rommel; their commander was George S. Patton. 
</P>
<P>
"General Patton was in that area a lot when he was training his troops to go to 
North Africa," said Marilyn Russell. "There's a Patton Museum off (Interstate) 
10 at Chiriaco Summit. There are remnants of the barracks, the airfield." 
</P>
<P>
A wide dirt trail called Tank Road bisects the area. For nearly half a century, 
it didn't have a name -- until Rick Russell came along. Russell charted it as 
the main feature of one of his Sidekick off-road maps, which start where the 
Automobile Club of Southern California leaves off. 
</P>
<P>
"The road was too wide for normal vehicles," he said. "I talked to a guy who 
saw Patton blow up water holes. He was so strict with the troops that he wanted 
them to get used to going without water." 
</P>
<P>
The desert hasn't changed much, but it's a more enlightened world. Anybody 
venturing into the desert is advised to take as much water as he can carry. 
When the troops now in Saudi Arabia trained in the California desert, they 
slept in air-conditioned tents. 
</P>
<P>
While man can adapt to the desert, the desert is not as flexible. Abuses 
endure. That's why some desert lovers would keep off-highway vehicles (OHV's) 
off the desert and out of the wilderness entirely. They are already banned in 
federally designated Wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
This is in the Russells' minds when they prepare one of their maps. They are 
working on their 14th -- all except one detailing remote Southern California 
sites, most in the desert. Their intent isn't to turn loose an army of 
environmental terrorists but to enlighten users of OHV's on how to pursue their 
hobby responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Russell said: "There are areas with few roads, few trails, which should be 
designated as roadless areas and closed out. There also are areas riddled with 
trails that are pretty remote -- Stoddard Wells, south of Barstow (for 
example). The Bureau of Land Management has designated it as an open area, and 
you don't even need to stay on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there is the in-between land that I like to use personally . . . the 
limited-use areas. You can go in, but you have to stay on existing roads. There 
are plenty of existing roads that provide the kind of recreation we like." 
</P>
<P>
Russell has been an off-road enthusiast since the mid-1970s, when he bought a 
'56 Jeep. Two years ago, he and Marilyn brought their first map to the SCORE 
show at Anaheim, were swamped by the response and a business was born. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn soon abandoned her career in corporate administration to handle the 
marketing, advertising and office chores. This year, Rick, a specialist in bar 
codes, quit his executive job to concentrate on making maps. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn said: "With four kids and the fact that we like to go camping, we just 
decided to downscale our lives and do what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
No other maps offer such detail of areas away from the pavement. Some BLM and 
U.S. Forest Service stations sell the maps alongside their own, which are often 
limited and outdated. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Arrowhead area, we collected six or eight maps, and none was totally 
accurate . . . trails that had moved, roads in the wrong place," Marilyn said. 
"People were getting lost." 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekick maps, printed in color on heavy stock, are created to scale from a 
computer-aided design program. Russell uses a compass, an altimeter and an 
odometer and will soon have a Loran electronic self-locating device. The 
Russells get a lot of input from locals and incorporate history, such as the 
location of the ranch near Death Valley where Charles Manson was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
They tap into local knowledge. Rick Russell once met a denizen of the desert 
known only as Uncle Snuffy, whose Jeep had broken down. Uncle Snuffy said he 
was 84 and a retired surveyor. Russell towed him home. 
</P>
<P>
"And I met his wife, who was five years older than he was," Russell said. "He 
was taking a nitroglycerin pill and chasing it with a beer. He really knew the 
desert. I think people are interested in mines, old buildings or foundations of 
old buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Such sites are noted on the maps, sometimes with written directions on the 
back. In some cases, to find unmarked turnoffs, "you have to count electrical 
poles," Marilyn said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Russell will charter a plane. When he did the map for the Little Rock 
Recreation Area, south of Palmdale, he checked first with a local Forest 
Service ranger, as he usually does. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand there's a fence at the top of Alimony Ridge," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I hear," the ranger said. "I've never been up there." 
</P>
<P>
Russell drives the trails himself, not only to check directions and distances 
but to rate them for difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"I meet a lot of people who really aren't prepared for the kind of terrain 
they're in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, on his maps, a trail marked with an "easiest" symbol means it's negotiable 
by a two-wheel-drive vehicle with a high center clearance. "More difficult" 
means four-wheel-drive is necessary; "most difficult" means only an experienced 
four-wheel-driver should try it. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Russell was re-exploring the Little Rock area to update his map. His 
yellow, custom-rebuilt Jeep, which he once rolled over during a nighttime 
sandstorm at the Imperial Sand Dunes, is a mix of technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The front end is out of a three-quarter-ton Chevy truck," Russell said. "The 
transmission is out of a one-ton Chevy truck, so it has a granny low." 
</P>
<P>
The V-6 engine was turning 2,500 RPMs as Russell crawled through Santiago 
Canyon -- a dry riverbed of boulders as big as beachballs -- at 1 m.p.h. on 
knobby 35x12.50 tires. 
</P>
<P>
The "monster" trucks with the giant, tractor-size tires are impressive but 
impractical for sidehill stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five inches is as tall as I'd want to go," Russell yelled over the roar 
of the engine. "Even 33 inches will clear most rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the ideal off-road vehicle is unsafe for street driving because it 
will roll over too easily. 
</P>
<P>
As the Jeep pitched and rolled down the canyon, Russell said: "In order to be a 
good off-road vehicle, you want to be as narrow as you can and as tall -- and 
as you can see from this trail, the narrower I am, the better. You get these 
big tires on there and you get it tall, it's not going to be as stable (on) the 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
Later, after he leaves the canyon for sand, Russell will deflate the tires from 
35 to 10 or 15 pounds for better traction. 
</P>
<P>
Russell usually tows his Jeep to the sites. Of course, many OHV owners have no 
intention of ever leaving the highway. They just like the image. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look at the paint job and determine (who they are) real quick," 
Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
One thing a new OHV owner must understand, Russell said, is that "you haven't 
been four-wheeling until you've been stuck a few times." 
</P>
<P>
That's why he advises carrying tools, including a shovel, and traveling in 
pairs or trios in particularly rugged terrain. Hauling up a 30-degree hogback 
road to Alimony Ridge, the Jeep overheated, sputtered and clanked, so Russell 
shut it off and set the brakes. Flexing of the engine had caused the fan to 
chop into the radiator, causing a leak and bending one blade. 
</P>
<P>
He got out his tool box, bent the blade back straight, poured some water in the 
radiator and was able to climb to a spot to turn around and head down. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 18 years, there aren't many parts I haven't broken," he said. "The 
U-bolts that hold the axles to the springs, I probably break two a year. So I 
carry extra U-bolts. They cost five bucks. If something breaks on my vehicle, I 
try to make it stronger." 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough world beyond the pavement, with a few tough people. Russell once 
was exploring roads west of Barstow when he met a miner who had been looking 
for a lost gold cache for 25 years. Legend has it that a miner with a load of 
gold buried it under a marker when his burros died, but also planted three 
false markers. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy I met had found the three false markers and was down to looking for 
the real one," Russell said. "He spends his weekends and holidays driving the 
roads looking for that marker." 
</P>
<P>
He might want to buy a Sidekick map. The marker is probably on there.

COURT OKS PARTY ROLE IN NONPARTISAN RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a precedent-setting decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on 
Tuesday struck down a state ban on political party endorsements in elections 
for judgeships and other nonpartisan offices, a ruling that could have a 
significant impact on California politics. 
</P>
<P>
The decision allows the Democratic, Republican and other political parties to 
make endorsements in races to elect county supervisors, city mayors, city 
councils, school boards and superior and municipal court judges, am ong others. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of political parties has been dramatically enhanced," said Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., chairman of the California Democratic Party. "This decision 
constitutes a charter of freedom for political parties within California." 
</P>
<P>
Since the days of reform Gov. Hiram Johnson 80 years ago, California has 
avoided injecting formal party endorsements into these races in the belief that 
this decreases the opportunity for corruption of the judiciary and local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But the 9th Circuit Court rejected that argument. The ban on partisan 
endorsements by political parties "illegally restricts political speech" and 
thereby violates the First and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, said the 
majority opinion written by Judge Alfred T. Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, there have been some party endorsements in nonpartisan races. 
However, a state constitutional amendment approved as Proposition 49 by 
California voters in 1986 barred the practice. A series of suits led to 
Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, U.S. District Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli in San Francisco, 
responding to a 1987 suit filed by 10 individuals and an organization called 
Election Action, issued an injunction prohibiting San Francisco from keeping 
party endorsements off the ballot in some nonpartisan races. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit overruled Zirpoli, 
holding that California's compelling interest in preserving its nonpartisan 
system of government for local and judicial offices justified the ban on party 
endorsements. The plaintiffs asked for a review by a larger panel of 9th 
Circuit judges and secured a hearing from 11 judges. 
</P>
<P>
Those judges voted 8 to 3 to permit party endorsements, despite pleas that it 
would corrupt the political process in California. 
</P>
<P>
To support his majority decision, Goodwin cited language from a recent Supreme 
Court decision: "Advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates . . . is no 
less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of 
political policy generally or advocacy or defeat of legislation." 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit majority rejected the argument that political endorsements in 
nonpartisan races "create the same risks of corruption or appearance of 
corruption" that the Supreme Court has previously determined justify 
governmental regulation of election spending. 
</P>
<P>
"The rationale underlying 'the long history of regulation of corporate 
political activity' . . . simply is not available as a justification for the 
complete suppression of speech by political parties, regardless of whether the 
elections in question are partisan or nonpartisan in nature," Goodwin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Pamela A. Rymer's dissent acknowledged that the ban impinges on First 
Amendment rights, but asserted that it should be upheld because California has 
a compelling interest in maintaining the structure of its nonpartisan 
government for judicial, school and municipal offices. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the case was clearly distinguishable from a 9th Circuit decision 
which gave political parties the right to make endorsements in primaries for 
partisan offices. "The partisan primary election is designed to ensure that 
party nominations are within party lines, thus preserving the integrity of the 
party," Rymer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of an election within the nonpartisan structure has nothing to do 
with settling the internal divisions within a political party," she said. 
"Nonpartisanship envisions 'direct representation of citizens rather than 
indirect representation through parties as intermediaries,' " Rymer added. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly sharp debate over the impact of endorsements in judicial races 
emerged in separate opinions written by Judge Arthur Alarcon, who dissented, 
and Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who voted with the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon quoted philosopher George Santayana, playwright William Shakespeare and 
President Theodore Roosevelt in asserting that the process of electing judges 
in California would be seriously corrupted by partisan endorsements. His 
lengthy opinion referred to railroad and land barons who corrupted municipal 
politics in California in the early 20th Century until reforms were imposed by 
Hiram Johnson in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt said that the reforms had left open the possibility of other means of 
corruption. He stressed that since California already elects judges, the 
process is inherently political. Reinhardt said that allowing partisan 
endorsements would be better and more democratic than simply allowing judges to 
"buy" their way on to slate mailers, one of the common means used to campaign 
in judicial races now. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs' attorney, Arlo Hale Smith, who is the son of the Democratic 
Party candidate for attorney general in November's election, said he was 
delighted by the result. "It's a great victory for the First Amendment," said 
the San Francisco lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought the decision would result in more party endorsements being 
made in local school and judicial races, "but frankly that's happening 
indirectly already because there are loads of people who put out slate mailers. 
It's only been the official parties not taking a stand." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco City Atty. Louise Renne said she was disappointed by the outcome 
and would decide within the near future whether to appeal the decision to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. Like Alarcon, she expressed particular concern about a 
potential negative impact on judges. 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent, it has been the tradition to remove judges from a 
political setting in California," she said. "This is a step back. If you have 
to go and get the endorsement of a political party, that is a setback to a 
judge's independence." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling, top officials of the Republican Party in Orange County said 
they would keep their longstanding practice of not formally endorsing 
candidates in nonpartisan local races. 
</P>
<P>
"We stay out of nonpartisan elections. We don't have a set of standards to 
choose which candidates should receive an endorsement," said Greg Haskin, 
executive director of the Orange County GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Haskin said that the Republican parties in other counties are eager to make 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes, here in Orange County, we may have several good Republicans 
running against each other. Getting involved in nonpartisan elections here begs 
for trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Orange County's Democratic Party will begin endorsing nonpartisan 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be in the more prominent races, such as city councils and 
mayoral races and the Board of Supervisors and others," said Mike Balmages, 
chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the (court) decision because parties shouldn't be restricted by law 
from voicing an opinion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Polsby, a political science professor at UC Berkeley and director of the 
university's Institute of Governmental Studies, hailed the decision, contending 
that it would boost the fortunes of political parties and curb the power of 
other special interests. "Part of having a free democratic society is the right 
of people to back people whom they support," Polsby said. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue comes down to whether political parties are uniquely situated in 
such a fashion as to be barred from this normal right of association and 
endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
Polsby said arguments that party endorsements would lead to corruption of 
judges and municipal officials are unrealistic. In fact, he said special 
interests, such as big business, "have learned to play very effectively under 
Hiram Johnson's rules."

SERRANO PROJECT UP FOR VOTE MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build 1,800 homes in East Orange received further scrutiny this 
week during a final study session before a Planning Commission vote on the 
Serrano Heights project on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodcrest Development Co. plan would convert 727 acres of steep slopes and 
canyons between the cities of Orange and Anaheim into a neighborhood of 
single-family homes and multiple-unit dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
One issue still to be resolved is whether Woodcrest will build a four-acre park 
as part of the agreement, said city planner Joan Woolf. Woodcrest may opt to 
pay the city $1,500 per residential unit to build the park, but it is unclear 
whether this amount would cover the actual construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
The four-acre recreation area is not the main concern of Mabury Ranch, Orange 
Park Acres and Anaheim Hills residents who say the project will destroy the 
bucolic beauty that brought them to the area in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for massive grading of a ridge north of Mabury Ranch and south 
of Anaheim Hills and would require moving some 12 million cubic yards of earth. 
Some hills may be cut up to 150 feet and some canyons may be filled up to 170 
feet. Three large knolls will be lowered to provide level building pads. 
</P>
<P>
"As a logical person, you don't tear hills down and start over. You make it 
fit," said Richard Hollinger, president of the Mabury Ranch Homeowners Assn. 
that represents about 2,500 residents. "Would it make any sense to live in 
Yosemite and take down the trees to build houses?" 
</P>
<P>
While most lots in the area range from 7,000 to 12,000 square feet, Serrano 
Heights lots begin at 4,500 square feet. Hollinger said that lot size is 
inconsistent with the neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes 476 acres of open space, 246 acres of which are 
designated as an easement for power lines and 148 acres that will become a part 
of Santiago Oaks Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is approved, construction could begin by the fall of 1992, Woolf 
said. The development agreement requires completion of Serrano Avenue, a 
four-lane arterial road that will connect Anaheim and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission will vote Monday on the Woodcrest Development following 
a public hearing. However, commissioners Don Scott and Carmine Masters alone 
will decide whether the project will move forward. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Randy Bosch is a Mabury Ranch resident and has abstained from all 
discussion on the project. Commissioner Don Greek resigned earlier this month 
to run for City Council, and David Hart resigned in May to help plan Greek's 
campaign. MARY HELEN BERG

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TRUST PLEDGED TO UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Fullerton couple has pledged a trust fund valued at more than $100,000 to 
create a much-needed biological sciences fellowship at UC Irvine, a university 
spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The William D. Redfield Fellowship will provide research funds and expenses for 
a promising graduate student in the department of molecular biology and 
biochemistry beginning this fall, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first fellowship of its kind at UCI's School of Biological Sciences, 
and Dean L. Dennis Smith said he hoped it would encourage the creation of 
others to support graduate students who otherwise could not afford to get their 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a fellowship when I went to school. Had I not had one, I'm not sure how 
far I would have progressed," said Smith, a developmental biologist who on 
Sept. 1 takes UCI's No. 2 position as executive vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
The fellowship fund was offered July 26 on Redfield's 75th birthday by his 
wife, Elaine, a longtime UCI supporter and member of the university 
foundation's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of contribution is an investment without peer," said Redfield, a 
retired scientist for the Chevron Oil Field Research Corp. who, himself, made 
it through UCLA's microbiology doctoral program in 1945 with the aid of a 
privately funded fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only way to attract really good people into research," he said. 
"Even a public university cannot depend solely on government support." 
</P>
<P>
A recipient for this year's Redfield fellowship will be chosen by a faculty 
committee this fall, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund is expected to generate about $5,000 annually to support a 
graduate student. Because it does not revert to the university until the death 
of the Redfields, they have pledged annual donations of $2,500. That amount 
will be matched by Redfield's former employer through its employee matching 
gifts program, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said graduate students in the University of California system are paid 
about $14,000 annually, which must cover tuition, fees and living expenses. But 
because only 50% of the graduate students are covered, the others, typically 
those who work in the sciences, must be funded through various research grants 
and fellowships.

"It is ironic, when you think about it, that there is developing a major 
national need for Ph.D.s in the sciences at the same time research support to 
train students is decreasing," Smith said, referring to the increasing 
difficulty professors nationally are having in winning federal funds for 
research grants. 
</P>
<P>
UCI, which took in a record $78 million in the 1989-90 academic year in 
research grants, is "doing quite well," Smith said. But for the biological 
sciences school to be at the forefront in this major research field, more 
fellowships are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I earnestly hope that the Redfield fellowship will be an example for other 
people to set up similar kinds of fellowships," Smith said. KRISTINA LINDGREN

STOREFRONT SCHOOL WILL OPEN IN MALL

<P>
Community leaders -- ranging from school social workers to chamber of commerce 
merchants to educators from nearby counties -- converged on Anaheim Plaza 
shopping mall Tuesday, not to shop but to take a look at a new school. 
</P>
<P>
Next to a shoe store and across the corridor from a fancy delicatessen sits an 
Anaheim Union High School District facility called the Learning Center, or TLC. 
It's the first storefront school in the county and something of a model that 
educators up and down the state are watching closely. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the former mall shop are rows of computer terminals, tables and chairs, 
along with a counseling room in the back, equipped with tiny chairs for younger 
children who come to the center while older siblings, or teen parents, study. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all kids fit the mold that you get through junior high in two years and 
high school in four," district Supt. Cynthia Grennan said. "I think this 
facility gives those students the opportunity to build their confidence and 
know that we're willing to invest in them." 
</P>
<P>
TLC will formally begin classes this fall, primarily targeting junior high 
school pupils in the district who have lagged behind in regular school and who 
need extra attention to catch up with peers. 
</P>
<P>
Students will study basic courses, such as math, language and reading, three 
hours daily on the computers. They also can talk with counselors about work 
preparation and career planning, and can take part-time jobs for work 
experience and school credit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the center is open evenings for parents to meet with social 
workers to discuss their children's needs, and to learn about services. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are coming to us with all sorts of problems, and we felt the real need 
for something like this at the junior high level. Many of them didn't have a 
place to go," said David Steinle, the district's assistant superintendent for 
educational services. 
</P>
<P>
TLC is something of a public-private partnership, funded with $200,000 in state 
grant funding, with the remainder financed through donations of equipment, 
space and volunteer hours. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, TLC will be a temporary stop for students who have gone off track in 
their school careers and need to catch up to move on, school officials said. 
Officials estimate that students will attend the center for about three to six 
months, and that the 22,000-student district can reach about 300 students 
annually through the center. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can shore up what they don't know, they don't have to stay here 
indefinitely, and they can go back to their neighborhood schools," Grennan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The center has housed summer school classes for the past few months, and is 
open on weekdays, but officially begins operating when school begins in 
September. LISA MASCARO

40 BARRELS OF GREASE SPILL AT RUSH HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tractor-trailer rig overturned on the Santa Ana Freeway during rush hour 
Tuesday evening, spilling its load of 40 barrels of cooking grease into a 
ditch, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the accident, which occurred at 4:30 p.m. south of 
Magnolia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Transportation workers mopped up the mess from the 
leaking 55-gallon drums, which pooled into a ditch on the side of the freeway, 
CHP officials said.

EDUCATORS APPLAUD COMPUTERS AS AIDES

<P>
Teachers at the Saddleback Unified School District no longer need to rely on 
cardboard pictures of Spot the Dog. Instead, with the push of a button, a 
nearly perfect image of a Renoir Pekingese appears on a television screen. 
</P>
<P>
In chemistry classes, dreary charts are accompanied by video images of 
chemicals bubbling in test tubes. And in English-as-a-second-language classes, 
foreign-born students are using a computer reproduction of their own faces and 
voices to learn the English word for each facial feature. 
</P>
<P>
The technological advancements are part of the district's yearlong experiment 
with "hypercard," a computer-linked media system. Teachers enter text and 
graphics into the computer, while at the same time programming slides and video 
images to pop on and off from an adjacent screen. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, using a National Museum of Art videodisc, teachers can retrieve 
Vincent van Gogh's "Farmhouse in Provence" in three seconds, and with the punch 
of another button, reveal a videotape lecture on the same painting. Meanwhile, 
the computer grinds out questions and information on Van Gogh's life. 
</P>
<P>
Hypercard "opens the ability to broaden lesson plans. Teachers are using the 
computer to renew themselves and avoid burnout," said Linda Smith, the 
district's educational-technology specialist who heads the hypercard program. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 program was started last year at 32 of the district's schools. 
This year, at least one hypercard module will be installed at every school in 
the district and more computers will be added with a $125,000 grant from IBM. 
Nine additional computers also will be added for student programming classes. 
</P>
<P>
According to teachers who used hypercard last year, the computer system 
revolutionized their teaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take four to five hours to prepare the same lesson without the 
hypercard," said Debbie Derloshom, a fourth-grade teacher at La Madera 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
In her program on California missions, Derloshom used computer-drawn Indians 
and music from "The Twilight Zone" to appeal to her Nintendo-generation 
students. She also wrote her own text for the program, one that she thought was 
more challenging than that contained in the students' textbook. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to include both the pros and cons of Father Junipero Serra, from both 
the Indians' and the Spanish point of view . . . things that are not in the 
fourth-grade textbook." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other programs invented by teachers last year included one 
containing the text of the original "Cinderella" story spliced with the 
animated Disney tale running on the videodisc player, and a program on rocks 
and minerals that analyzed specimens that students brought from their back 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The hypercard programs were a big success with her students, Derloshom said, 
because each child took a turn operating the computer. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw problem kids become leaders. Those kids tend to take risks and with the 
computer, if you take risks, you succeed," Derloshom said. 
</P>
<P>
The district also plans to use hypercard public relations programs for 
prospective residents at the district headquarters and at the Rancho Santa 
Margarita home-buyers center. 
</P>
<P>
But the emphasis will continue to be on using hypercard as a classroom tool, 
Smith said. While only 32 teachers -- one at each of the equipped schools -- 
took advantage of the program last year, about 36 are expected to participate 
this year and many schools are investing in additional computers so that the 
technology will be available to more than one class. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes hundreds of hours to learn how to use (hypercard) and implement it, 
but once you have it, it opens up a whole new world," Smith said. CHERYLANNE

BLAZE DAMAGES SILK-SCREEN FIRM 
</P>

<P>
More than 55 firefighters worked for about 40 minutes to contain a structure 
fire that caused $80,000 damage to an Anaheim silk-screening and graphic art 
company, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the fire that burned through the Joy Art Co. at 
312 N. Anaheim Blvd. at 11 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators Tuesday had not yet determined the cause of blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Set-Free Christian Fellowship church and warehouse, located next to the 
building that burned, received minor exterior damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's hazardous materials crew responded to the scene to dike and mop up 
the water runoff used to battle the fire because it contained ink, paint 
thinner, paint and other chemicals used in the silk screening process.

PLAN TO MERGE COUNTY AGENCIES ENDORSED; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: SUPPORTERS SAY CONSOLIDATION WOULD SAVE MONEY AND STREAMLINE 
OPERATIONS.

The on-again, off-again efforts to consolidate Orange County's major 
transportation agencies received a boost Tuesday, as the county's 
Transportation Commission voted to endorse a proposal that would merge the 
agencies by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The action came less than a week after county supervisors voted to reject the 
consolidation proposal supported by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the consolidation of the transportation commission and the 
Orange County Transit District would save money and streamline the county's 
transportation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, the board's leading proponent of consolidation, 
said Tuesday's reversal was the result of changes made to the proposal that 
help ensure "genuine consolidation." 
</P>
<P>
"What we're getting now is real consolidation and not just the illusion of it," 
Stanton said. "I'm satisfied with this." 
</P>
<P>
Under the amended proposal, the transportation commission and the transit 
district will have until December, 1991, to develop a consolidation plan. Once 
that plan is submitted, the two agencies will merge their boards. 
</P>
<P>
The previous proposal would have merged the boards first, and supervisors -- 
who will be in the minority on the new organization -- worried that it would 
not be followed by consolidation of the agencies. The result, board members 
feared, would be that they would give up their political parity and still not 
see any cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton communicated those objections to Bergeson in a four-page letter sent 
Monday, and the senator joined Tuesday's transportation commission hearing by 
speaker phone. Once the amended version was agreed upon, Stanton and Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, both of whom are commission members, withdrew their opposition 
and voted for the consolidation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested a woman in connection with the shooting death of a longtime 
male acquaintance whose body was found Tuesday morning in an upstairs bedroom 
of her Newport Beach condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Helen S. Parser, 49, also known as Susan Parson, was booked on suspicion of 
murder after police received a call about 6:30 a.m. saying that a man had been 
killed in Parser's Escapade Court townhouse, located on a high bluff above 
Coast Highway, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Parser was being held in Newport Beach Jail with her bail set at $250,000, the 
officer added. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim, who was shot an unknown number of times, was 
withheld pending notification of his relatives. An autopsy was scheduled for 
today, a coroner's official said. 
</P>
<P>
Parser, who reportedly had an "on-again, off-again" relationship with the 
victim for the last nine years, is suspected of shooting him sometime during 
the night after an altercation, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was not living with Parser, Gonis added, and it was not known if the 
couple were still romantically involved. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said that someone who knew the couple tipped off police to the shooting 
by calling 911. He would not identify the caller, calling the person a 
potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they surrounded the Newport Crest condominium complex and 
ordered Parser out of her two-story, tan-colored townhouse, Gonis said. She 
surrendered without incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim was found lying on the floor fully clothed, and there were some 
areas that were in disarray," Gonis said. Investigators, he added, had not 
determined if there had been a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives obtained a warrant to search the townhouse and seized a pistol and 
other personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives have not established a motive in the slaying, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had some type of relationship that goes back approximately nine years," 
Gonis said of the couple. "It has been termed as on-again and off-again." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fluet, who lives next door to Parser, said he heard what sounded like a 
gunshot in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it sounded like a gunshot and then thought, 'No, I could be hearing 
things,' " he said. About two hours later, he added, he heard the sound of 
glass shattering. 
</P>
<P>
"This is strange for this community," he said. "It's a pretty private 
community." 
</P>
<P>
As detectives gathered evidence, Parser's garage door was left open, revealing 
stacks of half-packed boxes. Her 1986 silver Pontiac Fiero was parked in the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Parser generally kept to herself. Neither police nor neighbors 
could say what she did for a living. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, Parser bought the townhouse last year for $270,000, 
moving from Pasadena. She was trying to sell it for $299,500, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning was not the first time that police had been called to Parser's 
home. Gonis said that on May 28, police arrested her on suspicion of public 
drunkenness after being called by a neighbor. He said he did not know if the 
victim in the shooting was at Parser's residence at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Keeler, 30, the neighbor who called the police that day, said he was 
sitting in his townhouse drinking coffee when he heard loud noises coming from 
a front porch that he and Parser shared. 
</P>
<P>
"She came charging in my house, screaming, 'Help me, help me, call the police,' 
" Keeler related. "She really looked intoxicated." 
</P>
<P>
Keeler said that a man whom Parser had been living with came into his house and 
dragged her out. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler said that on Tuesday, as he was preparing to take his wife to the 
airport about 6:30 a.m., he saw a police officer standing behind the mailboxes 
out front, pointing a shotgun toward Parser's townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hit close to home," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T SHOOT AT THE MARINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine officials have been so concerned about Marine Corps helicopter flights 
over their city that last month they asked the Defense Department to stop all 
flights out of the Tustin air base. So it is hard to believe that the city 
would seriously consider making the situation worse by allowing nearly 4,000 
new homes to be built under the helicopter flight path -- in the Irvine Co.'s 
proposed Westpark II residential village -- without requiring adequate sound 
protection for all the residents. 
</P>
<P>
That is what would happen if the city makes the mistake of not following the 
reasonable recommendation of its own planning staff, and of the Marines, to 
require soundproofing of all the homes. The Irvine Co. has asked to exempt a 
substantial number from the requirement, and the Planning Commission now has 
the development before it. 
</P>
<P>
The city, out of concern for its residents and the Marines' vital military 
mission, should turn a deaf ear to the developer's demands. 
</P>
<P>
The area, on the doorstep of the air base, probably is not the best place in 
Orange County for a new housing project. But nobody, including the Marines, is 
saying that housing shouldn't be built. The reality is that residents will see 
and hear the helicopters regularly; and the Marines' firm policy is not to 
compromise flight safety for noise-abatement measures. Therefore, it is in 
everyone's best interest to minimize helicopter noise. 
</P>
<P>
Although prospective homeowners now must be advised of the closeness of the air 
station and their homes' location beneath flight patterns, history shows that 
such homes are bought, and later residents raise complaints about the noise, 
demanding that flights be rerouted or halted altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps is understandably concerned that this will happen again, 
resulting in increased pressure on the air station's operations, which require 
intensive training to maintain combat readiness. The crises in Liberia and 
Kuwait offer ample evidence of the need to preserve the Marines' military 
mission. Adequate sound attenuation for all the new homes could help make life 
considerably more comfortable for everybody concerned. 
</P>
<P>
In the unlikely event that the Irvine Co. could demonstrate that any part of 
the area would not be subject to helicopter noise, the city might have grounds 
to exempt some homes, giving buyers the choice of purchasing noise-reduction as 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, all homes should be built with it. Anything less would not be a 
sound policy.

Augie Garrido, the baseball coach who wasn't the happiest of campers when he 
left Cal State Fullerton for Illinois in 1987, will pitch his tent with the 
Titans once again. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, who guided Fullerton to national championships in 1979 and 1984, was 
named the Titans' new coach Tuesday, replacing Larry Cochell, who resigned July 
3 to accept the Oklahoma job. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, 51, signed a three-year contract that, according to Fullerton 
assistant athletic director Steve DiTolla, will pay a base salary of $66,984 a 
year. He will also receive an annual $10,000 salary supplement, which will come 
from the athletic department's fund-raising pool. 
</P>
<P>
Football Coach Gene Murphy is the only other Titan coach who receives such a 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Garrido will receive revenue from summer baseball camps, an amount 
the coach predicted to be in the $10,000 to $15,000 range, bringing the total 
compensation package to about $90,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido will also assume the newly created position of assistant athletic 
director for community relations, a role that will involve public relations and 
fund-raising for the entire athletic department and the Titan Sports Complex, 
Fullerton's on-campus stadium that is scheduled for construction beginning this 
fall. 
</P>

"I'm a very happy man," said Garrido, who flew from Edmonton, Canada, where he 
was serving as a coach with Team USA, to Orange County Tuesday to hammer out 
the final details of the contract. "This is my home, and I'm happy to be 
relocating to the area where my family is. I have deep feelings about the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, who had a 667-292-6 record in 15 seasons as Titan coach (1973-87), had 
some bitter feelings when he left three years ago. He complained of the 
school's lack of commitment to the baseball program. Little progress was being 
made on plans for a new stadium, and Garrido was tired of focusing so much 
attention and energy on fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
He rarely had the resources to act on new ideas and said he felt like he was 
"treading water" at Fullerton. Illinois lured him with a six-figure contract 
that included revenue from baseball camps, a shoe contract and radio show. The 
school had also just built a 1,500-seat baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But Garrido, sounding like a born-again Titan, is convinced he won't be 
plunging into the same old job and the same old problems at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The sports complex is on the verge of construction and much of the fund-raising 
burden has been eased. In the past, coaches have been directly responsible for 
raising 40%, or about $100,000, of the baseball budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Their commitment to roll up their sleeves and get in there and help with the 
fund-raising makes a big difference," Garrido said. "Doing it all by yourself 
gets old." 
</P>
<P>
There will be plenty to do in the next few years. The base plans for the 
1,500-seat baseball portion of the sports complex don't include a baseball 
pavilion, which is supposed to have a press box, concession stands and 
restrooms. The school will have to raise an additional $800,000 to build the 
pavilion, but Garrido doesn't see this as a burden. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about the challenges and opportunities at Fullerton," he said. "A 
lot of problems need to be solved, and if they are, we can make significant 
contributions to North Orange County through the stadium. That's a real buzz 
for me, thinking we can put up a stadium that people will use for the next 50 
years." 
</P>
<P>
While the sports complex, scheduled for completion in the fall of 1992, is 
being constructed, Fullerton will play its next two seasons at Amerige Park in 
downtown Fullerton. Garrido hopes to turn this potential drawback into an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's handled right, it could be interesting," he said. "That park has a lot 
of history. Walter Johnson played there, the Wrigley family built it, and the 
Chicago Cubs trained there. We could rejuvenate it. I've always looked at 
things a little weird, but it could be dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the thrust of Garrido's new role as assistant athletic director 
will be fund raising. But his efforts will be on behalf of the entire athletic 
department, and he says he won't feel pressured to raise money for bats and 
balls and uniforms and scholarships -- the things he focused on before. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration will take care of the nuts and the bolts of the baseball 
program," Garrido said. "I don't see it as a burden when it's part of a team 
effort to make things better. I want to have input into the direction of the 
baseball program, and I want to make a contribution to more than just 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido's contribution to the baseball program should be significant, according 
to local coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He brings instant recognition and a reputation for success," said Rancho 
Santiago Coach Don Sneddon, who played for Garrido in the 1970s. "His name 
alone will generate a lot of interest in the program. That's a good selling 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Sneddon said that despite Fullerton's success under Cochell, who guided the 
Titans to two College World Series appearances in three seasons, many of Orange 
County's top players weren't sold on the program and decided to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But with Garrido returning, Sneddon believes Fullerton will return to 
prominence in the minds of top recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"Augie has established himself as a premier coach, and he has always been able 
to attract premier players in Orange County," Sneddon said. "I think that will 
happen again, whereas I don't think it happened in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he did some fine things, Cochell wasn't here long enough to 
establish himself in Orange County. Maybe after this year, he might have 
established himself, but he chose to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Before Garrido chose to leave Fullerton, he had built the program almost from 
scratch into a national power. A Visalia native who came to Fullerton from Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo in 1973, Garrido's first project was to build Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton won the Division II California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship 
in 1974 and, after moving to Division I in 1975, the Titans won the Pacific 
Coast Athletic Assn. title and the NCAA Western Regional championship. 
</P>
<P>
In 13 years at the Division I level, Garrido guided the Titans to 11 NCAA 
regional appearances and four College World Series appearances. 
</P>
<P>
He has sent numerous players into professional baseball, including Montreal 
Expos third baseman Tim Wallach, Chicago Cubs pitcher Mike Harkey, St. Louis 
Cardinals pitcher Greg Mathews and Seattle Mariners reliever Mike Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best guy they could possibly get," said Titan third baseman Phil 
Nevin, who is entering his sophomore year and spent six weeks with Garrido on 
Team USA this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I like his style of coaching. He's aggressive, hard-nosed, and he'll do 
anything to win. He has that hatred for losing that I have." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, who had a 111-57 record and won two Big Ten championships at Illinois, 
has not decided who his assistants will be, but former major league shortstop 
Rick Burleson has been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
So has Tom Thomas, a former Titan outfielder who worked under Garrido at 
Illinois. Garrido said Thomas is considering an offer to join Loyola Marymount 
Coach Chris Smith's staff. Garrido's top Illinois assistant, former Titan 
player Jody Robinson, will apply for the head job at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido beat out three other finalists for the Fullerton job: UC Santa Barbara 
Coach Al Ferrer, Riverside City Coach Dennis Rogers and Cerritos Coach George 
Horton. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention was to hire the best baseball coach available, and I think we 
did that," DiTolla said. "We look forward to great things from Augie Garrido. 
His record speaks for itself. He's just what we needed to vault the program 
into the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>

CARDINALS ELIMINATED FROM CONNIE MACK SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Cardinals lost a pair of games Tuesday and were eliminated 
from the Connie Mack World Series at Farmington, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Host Farmington defeated the Cardinals, 9-8, in eight innings to begin the day. 
The Cardinals took an 8-5 lead in the top of the sixth inning when Bo Haley hit 
a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Haley graduated from El Toro High School in June and will play for USC next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A two-out, three-run throwing error in the seventh allowed Farmington to tie 
the score, and an eighth-inning home run by Derek Martin won it for Farmington. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth round of the double-elimination series, the Cardinals were beaten 
by Brooklyn, N.Y., 3-1. Walter Dawkins, a senior at La Quinta, hit a home run 
in the seventh for the Cardinals.

NEWSWIRE: MAVERICKS WILL SIGN FREE-AGENT ALEX ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alex English, the eighth-leading scorer in NBA history, will sign a free-agent 
contract with the Dallas Mavericks to fill the hole left by Sam Perkins' 
departure to the Lakers, the team said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to get him," Maverick Coach Richie Adubato said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll take up some of the scoring punch with Perkins gone." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said English would get a one-year contract with an option for a second 
year and that it would be worth more than $1 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
English, 36, played in 80 games for the Denver Nuggets and averaged 17.9 points 
and 3.6 rebounds despite diminished playing time last season. 
</P>
<P>
His 17.9 average marked the first time in 10 years he had averaged under 22 
points.

FUNDAMERICA TO SEEK PROTECTION UNDER CHAPTER 11

<P>
FundAmerica filed papers Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco giving 
a required 24-hour notice that it intends to seek protection from creditors in 
a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, attorneys in a $150-million, class-action lawsuit against the 
beleaguered Irvine marketing company asked a judge in San Francisco to instead 
put FundAmerica into receivership. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel has scheduled an emergency hearing in 
San Francisco for this afternoon to decide on a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
The company and its former president, Robert T. Edwards, were charged last week 
in Florida on counts of fraud, securities fraud and running an illegal lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in four states claim that FundAmerica is a pyramid scheme, though 
the company maintains it is a legitimate consumer buying club. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Girard, an attorney in the San Francisco class-action lawsuit, said he 
is asking the court to appoint a receiver so that FundAmerica members can 
determine what has happened to company money. 
</P>
<P>
The California, Washington and Florida attorneys general filed papers in 
support of a court-ordered receivership. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to fully protect the public and prevent the dissipation of 
FundAmerica's assets, it appears that the appointment of a receiver for 
FundAmerica . . . would be appropriate," California Deputy Atty. Gen. Susan E. 
Henrichsen wrote in an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, FundAmerica disclosed that Edwards had wired $11.3 million to 
two mysterious entities overseas. Girard contends, however, that the figure is 
nearly $17 million because several million dollars were sent to another entity 
in British Columbia between November, 1989, and July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit claims that FundAmerica is still under Edwards' control 
despite vigorous denials by the company's new executives -- some of whom are 
Edwards' friends. 
</P>
<P>
"(The receiver) would have the power to collect FundAmerica's assets and 
attempt to recover the overseas transfers and to account for the funds that 
FundAmerica has raised and apparently dissipated during the course of its 
existence," Girard said. "The only real injury to FundAmerica under 
receivership would be its inability to commit future securities-laws 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis on Tuesday permanently banned 
FundAmerica from doing business in that state and ordered the controversial 
marketing company to pay an $8-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
"By imposing the largest fine ever levied in a Florida investor-protection 
case, we are sending a message to con artists contemplating operations in this 
state that fraud will not be tolerated," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Florida authorities estimate that Florida citizens who invested in FundAmerica 
have lost approximately $8 million since March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the charges against him in Florida, Edwards could be sentenced 
to more than 65 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Both Edwards and FundAmerica have denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The company issued a terse statement Tuesday, accusing Florida officials of 
malicious prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"The events in Florida are disgraceful," FundAmerica said in its statement. 
"These are underhanded tactics by the government. . . . Thousands of people 
from all walks of life are in support of the program and the benefits they have 
derived." 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old company is fighting to stay in business amid a flood of 
controversy, investigations in several states and other legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Patel has frozen the company's assets as part of the class-action suit, 
preventing FundAmerica from paying its salespeople and other employees. Florida 
officials have said that FundAmerica had revenues of $33 million in the first 
four months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica officials have maintained that the company is a consumer buying 
club that offers cash rebates to members because it purchases services in bulk. 
But nearly all of the company's service providers -- including MCI 
Communications and Carlson Cos. Inc. -- have canceled their contracts with 
FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica had 100,000 members in eight states earlier this summer.

CZECH CAR MAKER LOOKS WEST FOR PARTNER IN OVERHAUL; 
</P>
<P>
MODERNIZATION: STATE-RUN SKODA FACILITIES ARE PLAGUED BY DECADES OF NEGLECT, 
BUT DEMOCRATIC REFORMS HAVE SPURRED EFFORTS TO LURE WESTERN AUTO COMPANIES TO 
INVEST.

<P>
MLADA BOLESLAV, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over eight decades of car building in this dreary industrial town northeast of 
Prague could soon undergo dramatic change as Skoda seeks a Western partner to 
boost modernization efforts and transform the state-run concern into a publicly 
owned company. 
</P>
<P>
Such an alliance has been under discussion with numerous Japanese and European 
car makers, as well as General Motors Europe, since democratic reforms last 
November began the process of liberating Czechoslovakia from 42 years of 
Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Skoda's sprawling but aging complex about 35 miles from Prague is considered by 
many Western car makers to be a jewel in the rough, despite the lack of any 
substantial economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, we have world-class design and assembly here," said Jiri 
Danhelka, press secretary for the auto maker, adding that just last year Skoda 
scrapped its decades-old rear engine design and began producing its first 
front-drive sedan, the Favorit. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Skoda also plans to introduce a larger, front-drive sedan and wagon 
called the Forman. It also is under pressure to develop a new engine to meet 
stricter emission standards in 1992 if it is to continue exports to about 30 
countries, one of the largest outside markets being Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"But the government has not provided enough money for needed improvements," 
Denhelka said, noting that this is the main reason for a joint venture, which 
could eventually double Skoda's output and help satisfy pent-up demand for cars 
in both Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Some auto makers see us as the best auto plant in Eastern Europe, so we can 
choose our partner," Danhelka said, adding that Skoda will most probably 
announce an alliance later this year. "We are not at the mercy of anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Suitors include BMW and Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault and PSA, Subaru and 
Mitsubishi. GM of Europe is also talking with Skoda, although it is unlikely 
that the two will reach any agreement, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
There are conditions attached to any such alliance, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain final production in Mlada Boleslav and preserve the Skoda 
name," Danhelka said. "Another condition is the creation of social conditions 
as they exist in major Western countries," although he said the Czech 
government is likely to retain an interest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Skoda also "wants to preserve jobs for Czechs," Denhelka said. But the company 
appears unconcerned about the fate of 2,000 Vietnamese and Cuban workers 
employed at Skoda as partial loan repayments from those countries. 
</P>
<P>
Suitors also may be interested in Skoda's skilled work force, taking advantage 
of lower labor rates here when compared with other Western countries, he 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Danhelka insists that Skoda "is a modern plant and not a museum," as evidenced 
by more than 100 West German robotic welders and a modern, final-assembly area 
that puts to rest notions that Czechoslovakia, once a forerunner in industrial 
excellence, is firmly in the Stone Age when it comes to making cars. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent tour of the Skoda works revealed years of economic neglect, as 
well as the last vestiges of Communist rule. Any Western auto maker is likely 
to start anew instead of modernizing Skoda's hodgepodge of facilities, many of 
which were last renovated during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Many facilities are in dire need of structural repairs. Some still have meshed 
fences that once enclosed prisoner auto workers. The paint shop is over 30 
years old, and there are virtually no safety or environmental controls in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Workers may be justified in fearing that added automation under such a 
partnership could jeopardize their livelihoods, even if production is doubled. 
Industry analysts say Skoda's current work force of 16,500 at Mlada Boleslav is 
about three times the level needed to produce the current rate of 190,000 cars 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The parting of the Iron Curtain, as well as the elimination of European trade 
barriers in 1992, will undoubtedly mean changes for Skoda. It has enjoyed an 
85% share of the Czech market, in which there is a four-month wait for its 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It will certainly create new competition," Denhelka said. "Skoda had a virtual 
monopoly on the home market and that should not have been. . . . We must 
realize that quality and growth comes only from competition."

DISCOVERY: BADLANDS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON Address: north end of Isle Vista, Laguna Niguel Miscellaneous 
information: only street parking available 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking more like a mini-version of South Dakota than the traditional picnic 
table and tree-lined park site, Badlands Park in Laguna Niguel is a raw piece 
of land beckoning to the hearty, hiking-boot-clad naturalist. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-acre natural vegetation park sits atop bluffs above Three Arch Bay, 
overlooking Wood Canyon. Badlands, so called because of the terrain's sandstone 
bluffs that resemble South Dakota's Badlands, is on the outskirts of a new 
housing development on Isle Vista Street. 
</P>
<P>
The park features unusual sandstone formations produced by the effects of wind 
and water and affords a sweeping view of the coast and the canyon below. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Smith, who enjoys hiking from Badlands Park into Woods Canyon, 
it is a perfect area to enjoy the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to hike in the canyon," he said. "These cliffs have been forming for 
hundreds of years. Badlands probably looks just the way it did when the Indians 
were the ones standing right here, where I'm standing right now." 
</P>
<P>
Signs posted at the park entrance warn visitors to stay away from the edges of 
the bluffs and to treat the land with respect and care. There are no picnic 
tables. No cement paths lead the way through a self-guided tour. This is raw, 
undeveloped coastal chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody that comes out here should be aware of the delicate nature of this 
land," Smith said. "Irresponsible trashing and destruction will ruin what is 
here for everyone to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Sandstone formations are the result of rapid erosion, which loosens dry soil 
and cuts soft rocks into strange shapes. 
</P>
<P>
The area below the park, known as the Aliso Greenbelt, features 
chaparral-covered hills, dotted with coastal sage scrub and pampas grass. 
Within the greenbelt is Woods Canyon, which in turn opens into Aliso Creek. The 
greenbelt supports several types of trees that normally grow inland, including 
the California sycamore and the interior live oak. 
</P>
<P>
Below the bluffs, a coastal plateau offers naturalists an opportunity to 
closely explore the area's diverse vegetation. Favorable soil conditions and 
the cooling influence of coastal fog allow plants normally found in the inland 
mountains and northern coastal California to grow alongside plants prevalent in 
San Diego County and Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
A concern for the protection of the bluff made Smith reluctant to share 
Badlands Park with the rest of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real find," he said. "I haven't found any other local hillside where 
I look this far out into the Pacific and not be standing in somebody's living 
room." APRIL JACKSONAddress: north end of Isle Vista, Laguna Niguel

KINGSTON TRIO HELPS DISCOVERY MUSEUM NET $25,000;

The Discovery Museum of Orange County was the site of a picnic fund-raiser 
Saturday night, highlighted by an alfresco after-dinner concert by the Kingston 
Trio. "Who's that?" asked Bob Howard's twentysomething children as he and his 
wife, Cleva, headed for the 11-acre museum compound in Santa Ana. Before your 
time, said Howard, a Newport Beach developer and museum board president. "Gosh, 
that made me feel old." The Howards were among 300 guests who paid $75 each for 
a chance to bid on silent and live auction items, eat a barbecued chicken and 
warm berry cobbler dinner and sit back while the folk trio sang its vintage 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Memories 
</P>
<P>
The casually dressed guests -- many of whom became museum supporters through 
their children's participation in educational programs and tours -- got that 
distant, misty-eyed look when asked about the Kingston "Hang Down Your Head Tom 
Dooley" Trio. Steve Gilbert, who poured free beer and wine under a trellis on 
the lawn, started snappin' his fingers and tappin' his toes during the Trio's 
sound check. "Ain't it hard, ain't it hard, ain't it hard -- great God!" 
Gilbert sang along. "That's worth the price of admission, just hearing the 
warm-up song," he enthused. Dick Hoyal said he had been a Trio fan since high 
school. Ditto for event chairwoman Jo Corbett, whose husband, Bruce, outfitted 
himself for the party in knickers, argyle socks, seersucker jacket and a 
polka-dot bow tie. Pete Tyson, cruising the silent auction tables with his 
wife, Karen, had a Trio memory circa 1959. "I was studying business management 
at Arizona State," he said, "and my fraternity brought them out for a concert. 
We sold 9,000 tickets, and paid them $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
Memories, Part II 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests was Jan Kellogg, wife of the late Hiram Clay Kellogg III, 
whose grandfather designed and built the house that's now home to the museum. 
The Kellogg House was moved from another location in Santa Ana several years 
ago and restored by a small army of museum volunteers. Gazing wistfully at the 
1898 Victorian classical revival, Kellogg shook her head in amazement. "We used 
to visit (her husband's) grandmother (in the house) when it was at 122 Orange 
St.," she remembered. By the time the historic building was given to the museum 
in 1981, "it had been empty for years, and it was boarded up and vandalized. It 
was a mess," said Kellogg, who now lives in Palos Verdes. "All the care and 
love put into it by the volunteers is just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Money 
</P>
<P>
With the help of underwriters C.J. Segerstrom and Sons, the Fieldstone Co., 
Fluor Daniel Inc. and Janet and Walkie Ray, the museum netted about $25,000 
from its seventh annual "Picnic in the Park." The money will be used to pay for 
hands-on historical tours conducted by museum staff and volunteers, Executive 
Director Karen Johnson said. Last year, Johnson said, more than 20,000 
schoolchildren toured the museum and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Plans 
</P>
<P>
While Johnson was thrilled with the cash infusion for ongoing programs, the big 
news around the museum these days is a proposed $35-million "major science 
center" to be built at the museum's current address or a site with higher 
visibility and better freeway access. The project is the result of "a fair 
amount of research" that indicates "a declining number of kids interested in 
science and careers in science," Johnson said. "We want to reverse that trend."

MAKING IT WORK;

TALK IT OUT BEFORE AND DURING

If you've been reduced to bickering while traveling with your mate, don't be 
ashamed to admit it. With a little eavesdropping, you'll discover you're not 
the only one feeling tense when you're supposed to be having fun. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Wayne, a Newport Beach psychologist and frequent traveler, offers these 
suggestions to help make you and your mate less testy when traveling: 
</P>
<P>
* Before you leave, sit down and talk about what each of you wants from the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't make decisions on the first day of a trip when you are tired and 
haven't had time to adjust to your new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
* Be aware of your partner's desires and tolerances. If your partner is 
miserable on a trip, you will be too, so do what you can to make the trip good 
for your mate. That doesn't mean you have to give up everything you want to do, 
however. Compromise. 
</P>
<P>
* If you don't share the same interests, spend some time apart. When you return 
to each other, you'll have adventures to share. And neither of you will feel 
cheated. 
</P>
<P>
* If you and your mate are very different, don't go on the kind of trip that's 
going to cause tension. Go where it's comfortable so your differences will be 
minimized rather than aggravated. SHERRY ANGEL

Ellen and David are in Rome on a long-anticipated vacation. They are living out 
a high-priced fantasy, walking hand in hand in one of the most romantic cities 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Then it starts to rain. David tries to hold the umbrella over both their heads, 
but Ellen complains she's getting wet and pulls it toward her. Now David is 
getting wet. And both are annoyed. Romance is fast turning to hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen spots a store that carries umbrellas and ceremoniously buys an expensive 
one for herself. They continue walking -- on opposite sides of the street -- 
until their anger finally dissolves into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the Rome fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene and Bob are in Paris on their second honeymoon. They have set out on 
foot in search of an obscure museum. They stop frequently to consult a map, 
which, they soon discover, isn't detailed enough for this excursion. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's find the nearest subway station," Marlene suggests. "I know which stop 
will put us out near the museum." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob is already asking a couple passing by for directions. Turns out they 
don't speak English. He's approaching another couple when Marlene stops him and 
says testily: "Do you know the odds of finding someone on a street in Paris who 
speaks English and knows how to get to this museum? This could take all day, 
and if you keep it up, I'm going back to the hotel!" 
</P>
<P>
Bob is irritated but decides not to argue. When they stumble on a subway 
station and find the museum, he's still irritated. After a quick look at 
paintings they no longer care about seeing, they take a cab back to the hotel 
-- in silence. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the second honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
People like Ellen and David and Marlene and Bob (whose real names have not been 
used because, much to their embarrassment, their stories are authentic) spend a 
lot of money traveling a long way from home seeking fun, excitement and 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
They don't expect to find themselves ruining precious moments in incredibly 
beautiful places by arguing over such mundane matters as how to read a map, how 
to arrange clothes in a suitcase, how fast to walk, how much to tip the waiter 
or how early to get to the airport. Or any of the many other small decisions 
that have to be made daily when traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in some of the most scenic spots in the world, exasperated couples can be 
overheard saying to each other, in hushed tones between clenched teeth, such 
telltale phrases as, "Now let's get one thing straight . . . " or "You handle 
it!" or "I know what I'm doing!" 
</P>
<P>
Only with a sense of humor can couples expect to survive the stresses of 
travel, especially in a foreign country, says Costa Mesa travel agent Maxine 
Schulman, who has seen a number of precarious marriages break up after a big 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
She once arranged a luxury cruise of the Greek islands for four long-married 
couples, and three of them filed for divorce within six months of their return. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much togetherness," she muses. "You either have it or you don't. There are 
unhappy people who travel together and they shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Maxine, who takes a six-week trip to Europe every year with her husband, 
Marshall, says she has seen many unhappy families as well as couples during her 
travels. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents go to see what they want to see and rationalize that the children will 
be fascinated too. They walk into Westminster Abbey and the kids are interested 
for about one minute. It creates a lot of tension." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent stay in Paris, Maxine became acquainted with an elderly couple 
who had brought their son, daughter-in-law and 18-year-old granddaughter along 
to share their first trip to Europe. The granddaughter managed to ruin the trip 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"She was bored, very bored. She was so bored and made them all so miserable 
they went home on the fifth day," Maxine says. "The grandparents were 
absolutely crushed." 
</P>
<P>
The Schulmans avoided such disasters by waiting until their two children were 
grown and ready to appreciate Europe before taking them along. And Maxine says 
she and her husband, who have been married for 33 years, travel well together 
when they're on their own. 
</P>
<P>
However, they have had to adjust to different ways of coping with travel 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, who is an attorney, likes to get to airports and train stations early 
and worries until connections are made. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a nervous traveler," Maxine says. "I'm much more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
His worrying doesn't upset her, however. She is able to remain calm and 
reassure him, because she never forgets he'd rather be playing golf in Hawaii 
than hopping around Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's doing this for me, so I'm careful and I try to make it as nice and 
easy as possible," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis and Viviane Wayne of Newport Beach, who have been married nearly 40 
years, also take an extended trip to Europe every year. They've learned to 
avoid conflicts by compromising and giving each other breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoy doing the same things, but sightsee at different paces. Viviane, a 
free-lance travel writer, doesn't mind walking when her feet ache. Ellis does. 
When he reaches his limit, they often set a meeting time and split up. He'll 
sit in a cafe and read or go back to the hotel while she continues to sightsee 
or shop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where compromise comes in," Viviane says, "because my greed is such 
that I can keep going and going and going, but that wouldn't be fair to Ellis. 
I may want to spend four hours on my own, but I'll take two." 
</P>
<P>
They also split up in museums, because Ellis breezes through and stops to savor 
pieces he particularly likes, while Viviane meanders slowly through each room. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing when one or the other is exhausted never works, they agree. But they 
learned that the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who is a psychologist, once let Viviane talk him into taking a monthlong 
trip to France at a time when he was under enormous work stress. When they 
arrived in Paris, it was hot and crowded, and they found their hotel barely 
habitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the mood to go looking for another place," Ellis recalls. "I just

Hal and Kay Pastorius, Laguna Beach residents who have been married for 23 
years, also know how risky it is to take along the extra baggage of stress from 
home on a pleasure trip. Last year, they set off in their 32-foot power boat 
for a six-month trip down the coast of Baja and up into the Sea of Cortez, and 
they just returned from a similar trip that lasted nearly eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the first trip, they had what Hal, a sculptor, describes as "a good 
yelling match" and almost turned back. 
</P>
<P>
When they put aside the aggravations that go with life at sea -- such as 
mechanical difficulties with the boat and inclement weather -- they realized 
their real problem was a neglected marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd drifted apart," Hal says. "We'd gone separate ways and had not worked on 
being married. The trip was a real test of our marriage and a redevelopment of 
our affection for each other." 
</P>
<P>
They not only rediscovered each other on that first trip, but also learned some 
things about traveling together that helped make the second trip go smoothly. 
For example, both have a tendency to take charge ("We're both the dominant 
partner," Kay says), so they allow each other separate "spheres of influence." 
Kay, who runs a cooking school at home, prepares the meals, and Hal takes care 
of the boat. And whoever suggests an outing handles the arrangements, Hal 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
They also learned the importance of communicating. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time something went wrong it was because we hadn't shared our thoughts 
or expectations or plans," Hal says. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, they realized they needed to take these lessons home and make 
their marriage a higher priority in their day-to-day lives. 
</P>
<P>
Kay stresses: "If people have problems in their relationship, they're not going 
to get any better by traveling together, and sometimes they'll get worse. 
Running away on a trip isn't going to solve anything."

GERE CASTING RATES SOFTER PROTEST BY ASIA AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Asian actors who have protested the casting of a noted Welsh actor 
as a Eurasian in "Miss Saigon" is taking a much softer line on the casting of 
an American movie star as a Eurasian in renowned Japanese director Akira 
Kurosawa's next film. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosawa's selection of Richard Gere for the role of a Japanese American in 
"Rhapsody in August" was described as "far-fetched" by members of the Assn. of 
Asian Pacific American Artists, in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based group, which has been active in the dispute over the 
casting of Jonathan Pryce in the now canceled Broadway production of "Miss 
Saigon," acknowledged that "the casting of Gere constitutes 'non-traditional 
casting' -- a Caucasian actor playing a Japanese role" within the relatively 
narrow context of Japanese cinema. 
</P>
<P>
But, added spokeswoman Beulah Ku, "Unfortunately, it (that type of casting) is 
not being reciprocated in America." 
</P>
<P>
Ku said that the actors' association believes that Kurosawa, widely heralded as 
one of the world's leading film directors, "is giving a white actor an 
opportunity in Japan and he's doing something different . . . Obviously (Gere 
got the part) because he is a star. He's a box-office hit." 
</P>
<P>
Reached at Kurosawa Productions in Yokohama on Tuesday, the director's son, 
Hisao, explained the choice of Gere matter of factly: "We don't need someone 
who looks Japanese. The situation of the story calls for an American . . . so 
we chose Mr. Richard Gere." 
</P>
<P>
Ku said Kurosawa's casting is in sharp contrast to what "Miss Saigon" producer 
Cameron Mackintosh is trying to do in his casting Pryce in the starring role in 
the $10-million production. Pryce, who originated the role in the London 
production, has been widely praised for his performance as a sleazy pimp 
catering to the desires of American GIs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably Asian American actors who could play the part," said the 
group's statement. "But they (the producer) are not giving them even a chance 
to fail." 
</P>
<P>
The actors' association determined its position at a meeting on Monday night in 
Hollywood during which the members also reaffirmed their support of the Actors 
Equity union for insisting that the starring role in "Miss Saigon" be played by 
an Asian. In response to Equity's action Mackintosh has canceled the production 
which was set to open next year on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Ku said the association is continuing its efforts to support Equity's position 
with a letter and telephone call campaign directed at the union's leaders. The 
Equity board is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon to reconsider its position 
regarding Pryce, after more than 100 of its members signed a petition calling 
for the change. The petition cited the loss of more than 50 jobs for actors. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosawa's film, which will be distributed in the U.S. by Orion Classics in 
fall of 1991, is about one family's emotional reconciliation with relatives who 
moved to America long before World War II. Bloom said that the topic provides 
Kurosawa, "with the opportunity to recall the traumatic aftermath of World War 
II in his native country." 
</P>
<P>
Gere, who plays the son of an Asian man and a white woman, has made a success 
of himself in Hawaii and, upon learning he is seriously ill, sends a letter his 
aunt and other relatives in Japan. He will speak Japanese in the film, which 
also bills stellar Japanese actors Sachiko Murase, Hisashi Igawa and Hidetaka 
Yoshioka.

YOUTH ORCHESTRA BRINGS GLASNOST TO THE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE AMERICAN SOVIET YOUTH ORCHESTRA FORGES COMMUNITY FROM A UNIVERSAL 
LANGUAGE. ITS U.S. TOUR BEGINS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A firsthand look at life on the international concert circuit for two USC music 
students is teaching them a lot about music -- as well as culture and politics. 
As members of the American Soviet Youth Orchestra, the touring players have had 
to cope with everything from the Lithuanian quest for independence to varying 
conducting styles and last-minute program changes. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's Hollywood Bowl program, for instance, has undergone a change in 
conductors, with attendant repertory substitution. "We just try to make the 
best of it," said 24-year-old Sarah Coade of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
She and Owen Lee, 21, of Santa Monica, both double bass players, are among 50 
Americans who have teamed up with 50 students of the Moscow State Conservatory 
for the two-month program, which was created in 1988. This year's itinerary 
includes a 29-concert tour through the Soviet Union, Europe and this country. 
The European leg has been completed, and the U.S. tour kicks off with Hollywood 
Bowl concerts tonight and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
When the orchestra toured the Soviet Union just about a week after Lithuania 
launched its bid for independence, it proved an eye-opener, Coade said. 
Visiting the Lithuanian city of Kaliningrad, closed to foreigners because of 
its importance as a Soviet naval base, the orchestra was led by a Soviet 
conductor in Soviet repertory. The concertgoers literally sat on their hands to 
keep from applauding. "The next night, though, with Catherine Comet (one of the 
orchestra's two resident conductors, who heads the Grand Rapids Symphony and 
the American Symphony) and no Soviet pieces, the applause was deafening." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans got a taste of Soviet living standards immediately upon their 
arrival in Moscow in July. The Soviets were segregated from their colleagues 
because citizens are banned from staying in tourist hotels. "We were all 
feeling frustrated," Coade said last week by phone from Hamburg, W. Germany. 
"We only began to feel like one orchestra when we got to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, Coade said, friendships were forged. When they learned that the 
Soviets do not have access to high-quality materials to make and repair 
instruments, the Americans gave them various pieces of equipment. And Coade is 
planning to enlist a Glendale shop in a mass re-hairing of Soviet string 
players' bows during their L.A. stay. 
</P>
<P>
Each American is paired with a Soviet roommate, resulting in some amusing 
attempts to communicate in French, German and even Spanish. But, Lee said, 
"it's a pretty open, natural environment. Last time there were some offhand 
anti-Semitic comments, and remarks against homosexuals. That hasn't happened 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans' ensemble experience has come in handy in dealing with the 
orchestra's changes in conductors. Principal conductor is Leonard Slatkin, 
music director of the St. Louis Symphony. Resident conductors are Comet and 
Leonid Nikolayev, director of the Moscow Conservatory Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah McKeon, the youth orchestra's general manager, speaking from Amsterdam, 
said that original co-principal conductor Alexander Lazarev of the Bolshoi 
Theatre Orchestra did not perform with the youth orchestra because he was 
touring with the Bolshoi Opera. "So Leonard Slatkin is doing the (Bowl) 
concerts," McKeon said. Commenting on the repertory changes, Slatkin said, "I 
switched the program to things the orchestra knows. The players arrive tonight 
(Tuesday) in L.A. from Amsterdam and will have only one day to recover from jet 
lag." 
</P>
<P>
Despite conductor and program vicissitudes, the rigors of traveling and the 
interpersonal conflicts inevitable in any large group, Lee said that this 
year's playing level is superior to the 1988 ensemble. And, said Coade, "the 
best thing about being in this orchestra is the relationship between the 
Americans and the Soviets. Everyone is really working as hard as they can to 
communicate, and to make this work. We don't speak the same native tongue, but 
we do speak music together."

U.S. GRANTS VISAS TO CAMBODIAN DANCERS;

CULTURE: TROUPE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE L.A. FESTIVAL.

The U.S. State Department approved visitor visas Tuesday for 36 members of the 
Cambodian Classical Dance Troupe, opening the door for the Phnom Penh-based 
company to perform Sept. 13-16 as part of Los Angeles Festival. It will be the 
first time since 1971 that Cambodian performers have appeared in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The visas -- which have been under consideration since early June -- were 
approved even though the United States does not recognize Cambodia or its 
Vietnamese-backed leader, Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, U.S. policies underwent an abrupt change when the Bush 
Administration announced plans to open a dialogue with Vietnam to bring peace 
to Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"We've waited so long for this moment," said Judith Luther, the festival's 
executive director. "It's wonderful that, for today, at least, the arts rose to 
the top of the State Department's priority list." 
</P>
<P>
Known in Cambodia as the Dance Troupe of the University of Fine Arts, the 
company was re-established by Hun Sen's minister of culture, Chheng Phon after 
the Khmer Rouge's takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the company's ties to the government, some members of the local 
Cambodian community have been divided over whether the dancers should be 
granted visas to perform, claiming that to do so would legitimize the Communist 
Hun Sen regime. 
</P>
<P>
The company's artistic director, granted a visa to visit festival officials in 
May, was only the third Cambodian under the current Phnom Penh regime to be 
granted U.S. entry.SHAUNA SNOW

UNITED NATIONS OF ARTISTS WILL CALL UCLA HOME; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: ARTISTS VILLAGE WILL BE A GLOBAL VILLAGE. SOME GROUPS ARE FROM 
COUNTRIES WITH CONFLICTING IDEOLOGIES, BUT THERE'LL BE NO ADDED SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
No extra security precautions are planned at the UCLA campus' Artists Village 
when more than 450 participants from U.S., Asian, Latin-American and Pacific 
locales converge there Sept. 1-16 for the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the scheduled stays of performers from politically sensitive countries 
including Cambodia and El Salvador, everything will be "business as usual," 
according to campus officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll use only the same security system that is in place on a year-round 
basis," said Michael Foraker, UCLA's director of housing, who noted that the 
festival is paying UCLA's standard conference fee for its visiting artists: $45 
per person, per day. "It will be business as usual, with no special 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Foraker said the village, scheduled to house 466 artists in two-bedroom suites 
on the northwest corner of the Westwood campus, will be subject only to the 
campus' "standard residential security," the main element of which is provided 
by patrol cars circling the area after dark. 
</P>
<P>
While the festival's artists housing staff said it will discourage the public 
from entering the Artists Village, Foraker said no measures will be taken to 
keep visitors out. 
</P>
<P>
Last week local representatives of Los Angeles' Salvadoran community met with 
festival officials to express anger and object to the appearance of poet David 
Escobar Galindo who allegedly has ties to that nation's government. He is 
confirmed to stay at the village, in addition to the Cambodian Classical Dance 
Troupe which received U.S. State Department approval for visas Tuesday. (See 
related story.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any need for any extraordinary security measures," said Judy 
Mitoma, co-curator of the festival and chair of UCLA's World Arts and Cultures 
Program. "We will have normal security; I'm sure there won't be any necessity 
for more than that. We're not going to sequester people." 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the Athletes Village for 4,400 athletes and officials during the 
1984 Olympics, UCLA's complex is expected to be a center of activity during the 
festival since more than 200 events between Aug. 31-Sept. 7 are spread out at 
70 venues throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The artists village is an idea that Judy (Mitoma) and (festival director) 
Peter (Sellars) have had all along to create an atmosphere of exchange," said 
Ken Wada, the festival's artist housing coordinator. "It's different from the 
shows and other official festival events because there's going to be 
interaction among the artists. This is going to be the fun place for the 
artists. There's no performing pressure, no production needs. This is just a 
place to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
Artists will be able to become part of the campus community during their stay, 
said Wada, a 1990 UCLA graduate who spent two years as student commissioner of 
cultural affairs. He assumed his post with the festival last month through a 
fellowship grant sponsored by the nonprofit group, Arts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Village residents will have full access to all campus facilities including 
libraries, museums and galleries and recreational facilities such as the gym, 
pool, tennis court and track field. Interaction with students is expected since 
UCLA students will make up most of the estimated 50 volunteers needed to act as 
translators, campus guides, message runners and helpers in the village's 
hospitality room. 
</P>
<P>
Logistics for the village are being handled by Sue West, the festival's company 
manager, who said not all visiting artists will stay there. 
</P>
<P>
The "very Western" Wooster Group from New York, for instance, has elected to 
stay in a hotel closer to the Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary 
Contemporary where it will be performing, because the housing at UCLA has no 
phones. Two film directors have also cited a need for phones and have declined 
to stay at the village, West said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rooms for artists and their staff, a suite will be kept 
available for festival officials such as director Sellars, who has said he 
plans to stay at the village. Ten paid artist coordinators will also reside on 
site to help schedule tours and excursions, work as translators, ensure that 
artists' religious and dietary needs are met and serve as liaisons between the 
artists and festival staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The Artists Village is really the best place to be; it's really where you'll 
see so much happen," said West, who also organized artists housing for the 1984 
Olympic Arts Festival, the precursor of the 1987 and 1990 L.A. festivals. 
</P>
<P>
In previous festivals, housing was set up in hotels. Mitoma said UCLA was 
chosen this year to make artists feel more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting them (up) in hotels would be more difficult because they would have to 
deal with things like people who were used to being tipped," Mitoma said. "The 
Artists Village will be a place they can relax and feel they have a home base." 
</P>
<P>
Among the activities planned at the village, Mitoma said, are jam sessions with 
UCLA music students and musicians from the Court Performers from the Jogjakarta 
Palace of Java, round-table discussions among artists and volleyball games. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have American musicians come in and play for our guests," Mitoma said. 
"We want them to experience lots of things, and what we hope is that they will 
mix cross culturally." 
</P>
<P>
While Wada said most artists will be able to select their own sightseeing and 
recreational itineraries, West said every group has already requested a trip to 
Disneyland.

Gasoline station owner David Rice said he did not want to be a gas-gouger and 
rejected a price increase set by his distributor. Now he can't sell any gas at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
The distributor who supplies Rice's convenience store, Crossroads Trading Post, 
padlocked his gas pumps Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did not want to be labeled as a gas-gouger and I wanted to do my part 
to keep gas prices down," Rice, 24, was quoted as saying in today's 
Winston-Salem Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who sells Exxon gasoline, said he agreed last week to increase his price 
for regular unleaded gasoline by 6 cents to $1.159 a gallon instead of by 8 
cents as the distributor, William Shell, wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he owns the pumps and the gasoline Rice sells and he locked the

"They're cutting back September liftings by 15% to 20% in order to reallocate 
their barrels," said one source, who commented on condition he remain 
unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
The source said he had been told that some of the reallocation would be sent to 
European refineries owned by Kuwait, which has been unable to export crude oil 
since the Aug. 2 occupation of its country by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and other industrialized nations had been looking to Saudi 
Arabia, the world's largest exporter, to help make up for the 4 million barrels 
a day lost as a result of the U.N. embargo of oil from Iraq and Kuwait, ordered 
by the international body in the wake of the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The sources could not give any reason for the Saudi action other than to 
perhaps help its beleaguered neighbor Kuwait by replacing the oil that would 
have normally gone to Kuwaiti refineries in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. companies that would apparently be immediately affected would be the 
members of the Saudi Aramco consortium -- Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. 
and Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
One source said daily Saudi production had declined about 400,000 barrels in 
late July to about 5 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Production has since rebounded to the 5.4-million-barrel level, but exports 
have remained steady, the source said.

Because of the car she wouldn't take, Pamela Richards has just picked up one 
free set of wheels and is about to get another. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old auto-parts worker and member of the United Auto Workers became 
a hero of the union movement earlier this month for turning down a $17,600 
Honda Accord on a game show because it was made at a non-union factory. 
</P>
<P>
The remark was deleted when the taped Ohio Lottery program aired a night later, 
but word got around. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone just keeps on ringing. I've had hundreds of people call me, telling 
me that they didn't have the right to delete the reason why I didn't accept the 
Honda," she said from her home about 30 miles from Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year employee of Toledo Precision Machining, a Chrysler Corp. 
subsidiary, also got a letter from Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca commending 
her. 
</P>
<P>
And a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership flew Richards and a daughter to Huntington, 
W. Va. -- where they stayed at the home of a company vice president -- to pick 
up a 1990 Chrysler Imperial to use for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"She stood her ground and refused to accept that Honda. That takes a lot of 
character," said Frank Horney, president of Huntington Chrysler-Plymouth Inc. 
He said he first offered her a Plymouth Acclaim, valued at up to $14,000, but 
then thought about what she did and decided she "deserves the best." 
</P>
<P>
Later this week, she will get another vehicle, from the AFL-CIO.

Fearing that the Persian Gulf crisis will create new oil shortages in their 
Himalayan kingdom, Nepalese formed long lines today to buy fuel for their cars 
and homes. 
</P>
<P>
With memories of the cutoff in oil supplies by neighboring India fresh in their 
minds, people started lining up for kerosene, the only source of cooking and 
heating fuel, as soon as dawn broke over the mountaintops. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of rationing in India reached the Nepalese capital, and motorists today 
backed up in long lines at Nepal Oil Corp. facilities, the sole distributors of 
petroleum products in the Himalayan nation. 
</P>
<P>
Housewives and children carrying plastic cans waited in the long lines even 
though an official of the state-owned NOC said the stock of kerosene is 
adequate to meet the country's needs for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
NOC buys crude oil from the gulf countries for hard currency but its 
counterpart in India, the Indian Oil Co., handles the delivery.

Two British airline flight attendants have denied a Tunisian colleague's claim 
that they were raped by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us they were not raped or assaulted and they said they were safe and 
well," the spokesman said.

<P>
Nawal Bel Hadj, 24, said in Amman on Monday that she had seen Iraqi troops rape 
five Kuwaiti Airlines flight attendants -- two Britons, two Egyptians and a 
Filipina -- in a hostel in Kuwait city Aug. 7, five days after the Iraqi 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi soldiers were like crazy, rabid dogs. These people had never seen 
women in their lives. They are savages," Bel Hadj said. "I will never forget 
these atrocities." 
</P>

Government sources in London said the two British flight attendants were 
interviewed by a British Embassy official in Kuwait after Bel Hadj spoke to

Malaysia currently produces 595,000 barrels of crude a day and exports about

Stock prices rose today in light trading, boosted by moderating oil prices amid 
signs that the Mideast crisis may be easing. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose a slight 0.50 point to 2,748.27. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by nearly 3 to 2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 885 up, 628 down and 476 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 135.21 million shares, against 130.32 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.44 to 186.54. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.70 to 340.64. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market was reacting favorably to the visit by Jordan's King 
Hussein to the United States. Hussein was carrying a letter from Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks received an additional boost as oil prices declined. Government bond 
prices rose, also helping the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been playing tag all day with bond prices and oil prices," said Walter 
Murphy, a senior market specialist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said the market's initial price spurt, in which the Dow Jones industrial 
average rose as much as 21 points in the first half hour, was based on 
expectations that some breakthrough was imminent in the Mideast. When that did 
not materialize, prices moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 
in face amount, at midday. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, slipped to 
8.76% from 8.77% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities rose by about 3/32 point and 
long-term issues were up as much as 3/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Brothers daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was up 0.79 at 1,154.36. 
</P>
<P>
The yield on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 7.68% as the discount 
held at 7.44%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.72% as the discount rose 2 
basis points to 7.34%. Yields on one-year bills held at 7.68% as the discount 
was unchanged at 7.18%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 1/8%, up from 8 1/16% late Tuesday.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has started what it calls an 
"informal investigation" of trading practices at the antiquated Spokane Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered Tuesday to exchange members, the SEC's Enforcement 
Division asked the exchange to provide documents covering surveillance 
procedures, complaints and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Exchange compliance officer John Campbell said the inquiry could determine 
whether the nearly 100-year-old exchange can continue operating as the nation's 
only exchange without an electronic quotation system. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange was established in the 1890s to provide capital for the mining 
industry in eastern Washington, northern Idaho and British Columbia. Despite 
efforts to diversify, it is still dominated by highly speculative mining 
stocks.

DOLLAR HITS NEW LOWS BEFORE STAGING RALLY; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY MARKET: IT FALLS AGAINST THE GERMAN MARK BUT RECOVERS ON MIDEAST AND OIL 
PRICE DEVELOPMENTS.

<P>
The dollar touched an all-time low today against the German mark but then 
recovered to stand little changed, propped up by a continuation of Mideast 
tensions and a rebound in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
An apparent failure by Saudi Arabia to garner a majority for an emergency 
meeting of OPEC led to a recovery in oil prices, which had tumbled earlier. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, led to a rise in credit market interest rates by fanning 
inflation worries. Higher interest rates would favor a rebound in the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar initially fell to the all-time low of 1.5533 marks compared to 
1.5640 marks at Tuesday's close. But it recovered to stand at 1.5620. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a slight easing of worries over the gulf situation had led to a steep 
drop in oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in oil, coupled with continued worries over the U.S. economy, led 
to an early drop in the dollar, which remained lower against most currencies. 
The market remains convinced that the currency will weaken even further. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar has in fact taken it on the chin" because of the sluggish U.S. 
economy, said Mark Cohen of Fuji Bank in New York. Cohen said the dollar could 
drop another 1% or 2%, although not much farther. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency dropped to 147.15 Japanese yen from 148.80. The yen was 
supported by a continued rebound in the Japanese stock market, where prices 
rose sharply for a second consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
John McCarthy of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank said the dollar is suffering from the 
"short-term perception that the U.S. economy is weak in its own right and 
relative to European economies." 
</P>
<P>
He said interest rate differentials favor foreign currencies, especially 
against the belief that U.S. rates will fall farther at some point. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted the dollar could fall another 3% to 5%, which would take it to 
about 1.4775 marks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was at 1.3030 Swiss francs, down from 1.3035. The British pound 
climbed to $1.9022 from $1.8970. Against Canada's currency, the dollar eased to 
$1.1430 (Canadian) from $1.1440. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said investors, particularly those with a long-term view, would find 
it difficult to justify buying currency such as the British pound at current 
lofty levels. 
</P>
<P>
He said given depressed real estate prices in much of the United States, "there 
has to be some long-term money coming out of Europe willing to buy assets 
here." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, given the need for capital in the United States, 
including such problems as the savings and loan bailout and budget deficits at 
the state level, U.S. interest rates may not fall as much as some people 
apparently think.

A District Court judge plans to cut $1.1 million from the $4.2 million awarded

A jury returned a verdict Saturday awarding Berosini damages for defamation and

individuals accused of releasing videotapes showing Berosini striking 
orangutans used in his act at the Stardust Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Myron Leavitt said today that though the jury could return damages on 
counts of defamation and holding a person in a "false light," Berosini can 
collect on only one of those counts under Nevada law.

The Philippines plans to sell part of the art collection of the late dictator 
Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, in auctions in New York early next 
year, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mateo Caparas, chairman of a presidential commission tracking down the 
allegedly ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses, said the collection included 
Italian paintings and 18th- and 19th-Century English silverware. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's International had been appointed as auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Commission on Good Government said in March that Manila hoped 
to raise $20 million by selling paintings, jewels and antique furniture 
collected by the Marcoses during their 20 years in power. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Lash, executive vice president of Christie's, said they are planning 
two major auctions in New York, probably in January, for the artwork, which is 
valued at $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that one painting in the collection, attributed to Raphael, 
could fetch up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Manila claims that the art collection was paid for with money plundered from 
the Philippine treasury.

"We are going to communicate personally the declaration and make a further 
appeal to the governments to do their best to resolve their affairs amicably," 
Islam said Tuesday.

The buoyant, supremely confident Donald Trump of his first book, "The Art of

the near-insolvency of his real estate and casino empire. 
</P>
<P>
In his new book, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," the financier thinks money is 
uninteresting, publicity is dehumanizing and life affords no protection from 
its tragedies and the passage of time.

Trump admits that even he got caught up in the '80s buying frenzy, and explains

A spokesman for Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader voted out as president of 
Nicaragua, says some 16 U.S. publishers are interested in Ortega's biography. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega is in New York discussing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be personal, not polemical," Paul S. Reichler, a longtime adviser to 
the Sandinistas, told The New York Times, "although it will of course talk 
about the triumph of the Sandinista revolution, its confrontations with the 
United States and the recent elections." Reichler said the plan is for Ortega 
to have a manuscript ready by September, 1991, for publication in 1992.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: SOME POSSIBLE REMEDIES FOR 'RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, AND DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our readers are great. When we wrote recently that there is no sure-fire cure 
for "restless leg syndrome," the letters poured in with suggestions to help 
combat this common problem. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from our mailbag, millions of people toss and turn because of muscle 
cramps and pains in their legs at night when they go to bed. Others simply feel 
compelled to get up and move their feet around because of an uncomfort-able 
restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
One woman recalls that her grandmother called this problem "nervous leg." She 
also suffers from it and has discovered that "running cold water over my legs 
or using a cold pack from the freezer would allow me to go back to sleep 
without tossing and turning." 
</P>
<P>
Another reader finds just the opposite works for her. She takes a warm bath, 
though getting up at 1 a.m. is slightly inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
Many letter-writers praise dietary remedies. One man has had far more trouble 
with nighttime leg cramps since starting the asthma medicine Bricanyl. He 
admits to not being an athlete, but his son, a college football player, 
suggested Gatorade. This electrolyte replacement drink has done the trick. He 
has not had a single cramp since he started taking it. 
</P>
<P>
Another couple also swears by Gatorade. In addition, they claim that getting 
extra potassium from bananas works wonders to relieve them from painful leg and 
foot cramps. 
</P>
<P>
A 50-year-old man has had restless legs since childhood. "It was four years ago 
that I found a way to deal with the problem. It was then that I began taking a 
twice-daily dietary supplement of magnesium and calcium. The symptoms have 
practically disappeared. My doctor suggested that this might be a placebo 
effect, but the simultaneous and unexpected disappearance of my migraine 
headaches argues against that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A vitamin and mineral enthusiast believes that calcium and vitamin C are both 
necessary. "When I was pregnant I started taking this combination. Voila -- no 
more leg cramps, and I had been plagued for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin E has also been praised. "One capsule two nights in a row takes care of 
my restless legs for a month or more."

PRONOUNCE MALIVAI FIT FOR TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's pronounced Mal-uh-VEE-uh, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
MaliVai Washington, victor over Ivan Lendl in the second round of the Volvo 
International tennis tournament, wanted to get that straight. "And that's with 
a capital V," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the pronunciation and spelling straightened out, Washington sat back and 
regaled his questioners moments after he stunned Lendl, the second-ranked 
tennis player in the world, 6-2, 6-3 Tuesday night. Washington, ranked 103rd, 
won in only 1 hour, 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Washington admitted, it felt pretty good. "When you beat one of the 
best guys in the world, it's got to be a highlight." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 11,000 was behind Washington at the start. With his artful 
footwork, big serve and quick hands, Washington manhandled Lendl amid growing 
cheers in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, the crowd swung toward top-seeded Lendl, a Greenwich, Conn., 
resident. Lendl is semi-local, after all. He's also the top seed and the top 
draw here. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore. That's because Washington's confidence never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the match they announce that he's won over 80 tournaments, and 
then there's me, who's won some college tournament. . . . Well, you've just got 
to put that out of your mind," Washington said. "I'm sure that sometimes he can 
use that as an intimidator. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have to say to myself, 'Hey, I'm just playing another guy on the other 
side of the net.' " 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 21, won the 1988 Volvo Collegiate Championship in Athens, Ga. After 
two years at the University of Michigan, Washington turned pro last year. 
</P>
<P>
In his last appearance in New Haven, Washington lost to somebody named Buff 
Farrow in the first round of the 1989 Pilot Pen Open, a pro satellite 
tournament also played at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's previous best victory was over Christo Van Rensburg, ranked 30th 
in the world. Yet, when Washington beat the No.2, he was about as frayed as a 
broken racket string. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gottfried said that's about normal for Washington, a native of Swartz 
Creek, Mich. Gottfried, a former top-10 player, is an Assn. of Tennis 
Professionals tour director and a U.S. Tennis Assn. coach who has had 
Washington under his wing for a time. 
</P>
<P>
"Mal's father worked with him when he was young, and set the important 
foundation," Gottfried said. "Mal feels things are pretty simple: You work 
hard, and you do well." 
</P>
<P>
But who expected this? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't," Gottfried said. "I never thought he had a chance." Then Gottfried 
paused. "Just teasing."

Boris Becker relied on trademark serves and powerful groundstrokes to claim a 
second-round victory in the U.S. Men's Hardcourt tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded West German, rated No. 3 in the world, defeated Brian Garrow, 
6-2, 6-4, in just over an hour Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi, seeded No. 2, also had little trouble advancing. 
</P>

Agassi needed 57 minutes to dispatch fellow American Robert Seguso, 6-2, 6-3. 
He broke Seguso twice in the opening set and got an early service break in the 
second set to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Guy Forget of France was eliminated by Australia's Jason 
Stoltenberg, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Eleventh-seeded Carl-Uwe Steeb of West Germany lost 
to Australia's Broderick Dyke, 6-7, 6-4, 6-0.

NEDERLANDER TO HEAD YANKEES

Robert Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization of theatrical 
producers, was named today to succeed George Steinbrenner as general partner of 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The limited partners met this morning with Steinbrenner, who must resign by 
Monday under his agreement with Commissioner Fay Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great confidence in Robert," Steinbrenner said. "As far as I'm 
concerned, I couldn't have got a better man." 
</P>
<P>
The Nederlander organization's Los Angeles-area holdings include the Pacific 
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, the Pantages in Hollywood, the Wilshire Theatre in 
Beverly Hills and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood. The Nederlander 
Organization also manages Los Angeles' Greek Theatre in Griffith Park. He is 
also chief executive officer of Milwaukee-based Allis-Chalmers, a manufacturing 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander, one of the limited partners, was Steinbrenner's third choice as 
successor. Steinbrenner's first pick, his 33-year-old son, Hank, turned down 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's his own man," Steinbrenner said. "He didn't feel he even was interested 
in it. My son was the first choice." 
</P>
<P>
The second choice, Yankees Executive Vice President Leonard L. Kleinman, was 
blocked by Commissioner Fay Vincent. Kleinman has been asked to appear at a 
hearing before Vincent on Sept. 6 because of his possible involvement with 
gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander must be approved by three-quarters of the American League's 14 
owners and a majority of the National League's 12 owners. Deputy Commissioner 
Steve Greenberg said he expected the approval process to take about 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nederlander family and the Steinbrenner family have been friends for many 
years," Nederlander said. "We continue and will value that kind of friendship. 
The New York Yankees are the greatest franchise in all of sports. We want to 
continue that kind of tradition." 
</P>
<P>
As the partners emerged from their meeting, Vincent was watching the Cincinnati 
Reds play the Cardinals in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll wait and have to learn more before I have a comment," Vincent said. "I 
don't know anything about the gentleman. I assume everything will be fine, but 
I don't know anything about him." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 18 limited partners attended the two-hour, 15-minute meeting. 
Lester Crown and his sons, Daniel and James, were not there because of a death 
in the family. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner said Nederlander would be in charge of the team on an interim 
basis pending formal approval by the major league clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great confidence in Robert. He was my selection," Steinbrenner said. 
"He comes from a family that's been associated with mine for 25 years in the 
show business end. I have been a partner in very many of his productions. As 
far as I'm concerned, I couldn't have had a better man." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, who headed the group that bought the club from CBS Inc. on Jan. 
3, 1973, was forced to quit because of his relationship with Spira, a gambler 
who gave him information on former Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield. 
Steinbrenner also made a $40,000 payment to Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner owns 55% of the Yankees. Vincent has ordered him to reduce that to 
less than 50% by Aug. 20, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kleinman threatened a lawsuit because he was blocked from becoming 
general partner.

It is the second time in recent weeks that Jackson, 28, has been sidelined with 
shoulder ailments. He is 4-2 with a 2.95 earned run average in 14 games this

NO WEAK LINK IN S.E. CONFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SEC WAS ONLY LEAGUE TO PLACE THREE TEAMS IN LAST YEAR'S FINAL TOP 10.

<P>
Miami was college football's team of the 1980s. But what about the conference 
of the decade? 
</P>
<P>
The strongest claim belongs to the Southeastern. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the SEC had the best winning percentage against outside 
opponents (.690) plus the most bowl appearances (56), bowl victories (29) and 
Heisman Trophy winners (Herschel Walker of Georgia and Bo Jackson of Auburn). 
</P>
<P>
Although the SEC produced only one national champion (Georgia, 1980) during the 
decade, that was as many as any other conference. The SEC also led all leagues 
in Top 20 appearances, and was the only conference with three teams in last 
year's final Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Most conferences have got two really strong programs, but top to bottom there 
isn't one close to the SEC," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State is an independent, but the Seminoles are considering joining the 
SEC. The league just lured Arkansas from the Southwest Conference and further 
expansion is expected. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Coach Jack Crowe said the Razorbacks will have a much harder time 
winning in the SEC than they did in the SWC. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going from first place in the Southwest Conference to fifth in the SEC," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, Auburn and Alabama tied for the SEC title last season and this 
year's race should be just as close. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn has to replace quarterback Reggie Slack, but the Tigers return their two 
top rushers, highly touted offensive lineman Ed King and a hard-hitting 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a finished product by any means," Coach Pat Dye said. "But we have 
the makings to be a good football team." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, coming off a surprising 11-1 season, will feature running back Chuck 
Webb, the league's second leading rusher last season. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama, under new Coach Gene Stallings, should have an explosive offense with 
quarterback Gary Hollingsworth and 1,000-yard runner Siran Stacy. But the Tide 
has to fill some huge holes on defense created by the departure of linebacker 
Keith McCants, nose guard Willie Wyatt and cornerback John Mangum. 
</P>
<P>
In the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia and Clemson are expected to battle 
for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, which tied Duke for the league title last season, wants Moore of the 
same this season -- specifically the pass-catch combination of quarterback 
Shawn Moore and receiver Herman Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn was the nation's fourth-leading passer last year, while Herman set a 
school record with 10 TD catches. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson starts the season with a new coach and an old style. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Hatfield left Arkansas to replace Danny Ford, who resigned after an NCAA 
investigation of the Clemson program. But Hatfield will stick with the same 
ball-control offense and attacking defense that made Clemson a national power 
under Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strength of the SEC, the two best teams in the South may once again 
be independents. 
</P>
<P>
Miami won the national championship last season, while Florida State finished 
third. Both figure to contend for the national title again this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes' offense will be led by Craig Erickson, who passed for 2,007 
yards and 16 touchdowns last season despite missing three games with a broken 
finger. The team's biggest problem will be replacing Cortez Kennedy and Greg 
Mark, the anchors of last year's dominating defense. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State must replace quarterback Peter Tom Willis and tailback Dexter 
Carter, but the Seminoles have plenty of talent returning on offense. The 
defensive leader is linebacker Kirk Carruthers, who led the team with 145 
tackles last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Florida State handed Miami its only defeat. The rematch takes place 
Oct. 6 at Miami.

It was as mystifying as it was distressing. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman catcher four years ago at El Camino Real High, Jason Cohen was 
the victim of a numbers conspiracy. The 60-foot 6-inch span from home plate to 
the pitcher's mound might as well have been the Grand Canyon, yet Cohen admits 
that the problem stemmed from a much smaller region -- the six inches between 
his ears. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a one-in-a-million thing," Cohen said. "I can't explain it, but I got 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the odds, it was odd, and it remains something that Cohen does not 
fully understand. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who started catching as a 13-year-old, was afflicted by what might be 
termed the Sax Syndrome or the Murphy Malaise. Former Dodger second baseman 
Steve Sax had trouble throwing to first. Dale Murphy, who came to the Atlanta 
Braves as a catcher, couldn't accurately throw the ball back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
As did Murphy, Cohen found an antidote -- a healthy dose of left field. It 
eventually led to a move this summer to first base, which rekindled Cohen's 
zeal for the game and helped him earn an invitation to play college baseball at 
the Division I level next season. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, there are the benefits that come with playing for defending 
American Legion World Series champion Woodland Hills West, which will open play 
against Utah today at 4:35 p.m. in the Legion Southwest regional in Union City, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Painful as it is to try to explain, Cohen (6-foot-1, 185 pounds) said he was 
unable to perform the simplest of catching chores: lobbing the ball back to the 
pitcher. He vividly recalls the first flare-up, during a junior varsity game in 
his freshman season, when the ball seemed like a yo-yo on a very short string. 
</P>
<P>
It was in a game against Poly that this quirk first drove him crackers. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wouldn't go," Cohen said, shrugging. "I'd catch it, go to throw, and 
it just wouldn't go. It was the most unique thing you'll ever see." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen double- and triple-pumped, then started over again. He had more pumps 
than Imelda Marcos. The patience of his pitcher, Donny Chelius, understandably 
wore thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I double-clutched about six times and Donny finally called me out there and 
said, 'What's the matter?' " Cohen said. "I said, 'Whoa, I don't know, what is 
the matter?' 
</P>
<P>
"It built up to the point that I completely lost it as a catcher," he said. 
"The outfield was an escape, it was a confidence builder -- a three-year 
confidence builder." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Cohen's offensive productivity was bulldozed. As an outfielder, Cohen 
posted superlative numbers in high school. He finished his junior season ranked 
fourth among area City Section batters with a .406 average. Two of the players 
ahead of him were Cleveland High's Pat Bryant (now with a Cleveland Indians 
rookie-league affiliate) and Chatsworth's Rich Aude (playing for Augusta, Ga., 
the Pittsburgh Pirates' affiliate in the Class-A South Atlantic League). 
</P>
<P>
Cohen batted .367 and drove in 23 runs last season at El Camino Real but drew 
interest from only local junior colleges. It was the switch to first, Cohen 
believes, that helped attract the attention of USC Coach Mike Gillespie, who 
invited Cohen to try out with the Trojans next season as a non-scholarship 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, puzzled that he had not been contacted by a single Division I recruiter 
before Gillespie's call two weeks ago, jumped at the chance and applied at USC 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Learning a new position took some application, too. Cohen had played but a 
handful of innings at the position when he took over for teammate Chris Teich, 
who injured an ankle a few games into the Legion regular season. 
</P>
<P>
His education continued in the state tournament last week. Cohen, attempting to 
backhand a one-hop throw from third baseman Del Marine, literally used his head 
while futilely trying to make the play. The ball took a wicked hop and hit 
Cohen between the eyes with such velocity that it caromed well into right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Having turned a double play or two, dug out dozens of low throws and knocked 
down his share of line shots in the hole, Cohen -- bloodied and bleary-eyed -- 
realized his transition was complete. 
</P>
<P>
"When that ball got me I thought, 'All right, now I don't have to worry about 
it jumping up and hitting me anymore. My nose is already broken.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the early stages of the Legion season, West's spirit seemed broken as well. 
Many of the starters had played for El Camino Real, which fell to Chatsworth, 
3-2, in the City Section 4-A Division final at Dodger Stadium in May. The loss 
threw West (35-6) into a funk and, defending Legion champion or not, the 
numbness didn't soon wear off. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't like to hear about it," Cohen said. "I haven't been to a Dodger 
game since, I don't think any of our guys have." 
</P>
<P>
Legion play began the following weekend, and while many of West's players were 
less than enthusiastic -- the team lost three of its first four games -- Cohen 
came out smoking. He drove in six runs while batting in the cleanup position in 
the first game. Later in the season he helped engineer a West streak that saw 
the team win 29 of 30 games en route to the state title last week in 
Yountville. 
</P>
<P>
"That first game definitely put me on the right track," said Cohen, who tied 
for third among District 20 players with 30 regular-season runs batted in. In 
14 postseason games he has an additional 17 RBIs and is batting .376 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's productivity is perhaps more attributable to his consistency than his 
power. Although he has hit just two home runs in 117 at-bats this summer, he 
has struck out a mere four times (3.4%). 
</P>
<P>
"He just doesn't strike out," West Coach Don Hornback said. "He almost always 
hits it hard, somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, had it been left to Cohen, the RBI totals might have been halved. First 
and foremost, Cohen wanted to bat first and foremost, and he informed Hornback 
of his previous success hitting from the leadoff position. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered it about as long as I considered myself as the leadoff guy," 
Hornback said with a laugh. "There was no way -- he's an RBI man." 
</P>
<P>
And after the West opener, Cohen had to admit he was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game, I had six RBIs with, like, two triples," Cohen said. "I'm 
standing on third base and Don says, 'And you wanted to lead off?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Uh, sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
Apology accepted. So what if batting first didn't work out. First base turned 
out just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"First base is a lot of fun," Cohen said. "I love it. It's like catching all 
over again." 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, whatever he had three years ago isn't.
