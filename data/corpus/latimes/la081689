NORMAN FREEMAN; BROUGHT TARZAN TO FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norman Freeman, the former general manager of Sol Lesser Productions who 
negotiated use of Edgar Rice Burroughs' "Tarzan" stories for films in the 
1940s, has died at the age of 81. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Barton, a Paramount Studios attorney and Freeman's cousin, said the 
investor and motion picture executive died Aug. 5 in a Santa Monica nursing 
home after suffering from Parkinson's disease for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Nazareth, Pa., and graduated from Pennsylvania State University at the 
age of 19, Freeman began his long career working on Wall Street while earning a 
law degree at night from Fordham University. 
</P>
<P>
He soon joined RKO in New York as assistant to its president. After serving 
with the Navy in World War II, Freeman returned to the studio and moved to 
Hollywood, later joining the Lesser company. 
</P>
<P>
He subsequently formed Principal Management with Sol Lesser, developing homes, 
shopping centers and what is now the Ironwood Country Club in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman leaves his wife of 48 years, Dorothy, of Westwood; a sister, Sara, and 
a brother, Charles, both of New York. At Freeman's request, there were no 
services.

R. B. ANDERSON; EISENHOWER'S TREASURY CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert B. Anderson, who was secretary of the Treasury under President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower but saw his later career clouded by an income tax conviction, has 
died at the age of 79. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a native Texan who had lived in Manhattan in recent years, died 
Monday at New York Hospital. He had entered the hospital July 25 suffering from 
cancer of the esophagus and died of complications after surgery, said his son, 
Gerald L. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
As Treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961, Anderson was known for being 
conservative and putting a high priority on preserving the value of the dollar 
rather than cutting taxes or paying for additional outlays. It was on his 
recommendation that Eisenhower decided that the projected surplus for fiscal 
1961 should be used to pay off some of the national debt rather than cutting 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving government, Anderson was a limited partner in the New York-based 
investment banking firm of Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co. from 1961 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He held other directorships and posts in business and finance and served as an 
economic adviser to the sultan of Oman and as a lobbyist and consultant for the 
Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to income tax 
evasion in 1983 and 1984 and to operating an illegal offshore bank. In 1987, he 
was sentenced to a month in prison and five months' house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He served his prison term in August, 1987, and completed his house arrest in 
January, 1988, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court disbarred 
Anderson, saying the illegal banking had been unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
In sending Anderson to prison, Judge Edmund L. Palmieri also sentenced him to 
five years' probation and directed him to make restitution to victims of the 
bank operation who lost money on his advice. The judge said he was aware that 
Anderson had been hospitalized for alcoholism 10 times since 1981 and ordered 
him to enter a treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Originally a Democrat, Anderson switched parties by 1956 and remained a 
Republican. As secretary of the Navy in 1953-54, and deputy secretary of 
defense in 1954-55, he was known as a quiet and efficient administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Anderson had held several posts in Texas government. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son Gerald, Anderson is survived by another son, three 
grandchildren and two sisters. His wife, the former Ollie Mae Rawlings, died in 
1987.

EVEN PHILLIES TOO MUCH FOR DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Searage knew the pitch was trouble as soon as he threw it. A man can spot 
trouble after 14 years' worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I let the ball go, it didn't do anything, I thought, 'Geez,' " Searage said. 
"I knew it was going to be bad." 
</P>
<P>
It was worse than that. Philadelphia's Ricky Jordan opened the eighth inning 
Tuesday night by driving that pitch over the right-field fence for a home run 
that gave the Phillies a 7-6 victory in front of 25,169 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Searage said he was going to try to relax and watch TV. He figures 
that would help him forget. A man who has played only four major league seasons 
in 14 years of pro baseball learns how to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always got to be positive, I've got to think positive thoughts," Searage 
said. "If I don't, I become a nut case." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's blast, his second home run of the night, was one that the Dodgers, and 
especially Searage, could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
It capped a game in which the Dodgers blew 3-0 and 6-4 leads and fell 12 games 
behind the National League West-leading San Francisco Giants, who defeated 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
It also capped an ineffective stretch of appearances since Searage returned 
from a back injury July 9, putting Searage's back against the wall of 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
He's 34. He has a contract that has always expired after one season. He is 
uncertain enough about his career that he will pitch in the Dominican Republic 
this winter, probably as the oldest American there, just so that scouts will 
know he's still around. To Searage, the home run meant more than merely a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you always have things you would really like . . . a two-year deal, a 
chance to stay with the Dodgers," Searage said. "But you have to be realistic. 
For guys like me, you live game by game. You pitch one year in hopes you'll get 
a chance to pitch next year. That's what makes nights like tonight harder." 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, when the Dodgers are deciding upon their left-handed bullpen 
help this winter, they are not going to review this game and blame starter 
Ramon Martinez, even though he blew their 3-0 lead by giving up homers to 
Jordan and Von Hayes. They aren't going to blame reliever Mike Morgan, who blew 
their 6-4 lead in the sixth inning by giving up a bad-hop single off his shin 
and a two-run double barely inside first base by pinch-hitter Dwayne Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
They are going to look at Searage, who has allowed eight runs in 14 innings 
(5.14 ERA) since coming off the disabled list July 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what they are thinking . . . but I don't want to guess," Searage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was disabled May 31 with back spasms, he had a 1.13 ERA and had allowed 
runs in only two of 19 appearances. He was their top middle reliever, a role 
that Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda tried to recreate Tuesday. He left in Searage 
to start the eighth inning even though Jordan is a right-handed hitter and 
right-handers Alejandro Pena, Tim Crews and even John Wetteland were in the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
But Searage has apparently never fully recovered from the back problems. He 
says he can't afford to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to have the job security where you could say, 'I can't pitch 
today, I'm not feeling too good,' " he said. "But I can't. (My back) has good 
days and bad days. But as long as I'm here, I've got take every chance they 
give me." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers need to take advantage of more chances such as Tuesday's, against 
the National League's worst pitching staff. Against starter Dennis Cook, Mike 
Huff hit his first major league homer in the second inning. Two innings later, 
after one of three singles by Eddie Murray, Mike Marshall hit his ninth homer. 
</P>
<P>
But then Martinez gave it away. He walked the first batter in the fourth, John 
Kruk, on four pitches. Then Jordan, who has nine homers, hit his first of the 
night. An inning later, after a single by Tommy Herr, Hayes hit his 18th homer. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws good, but he makes mistakes," Lasorda said of Martinez, who since 
being recalled from triple-A Albuquerque July 16, has allowed 18 runs and 18 
walks in 36 innings for a 4.50 ERA. "You have to learn by trial and error, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who followed Martinez, has seen enough trials this season. The bad luck 
that has plagued the former National League ERA leader happened again in the 
sixth, particularly on the one-out grounder by Charlie Hayes that hit a seam 
and popped over Dodger second baseman Willie Randolph's head to start the 
Phillies' game-tying, two-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitcher John Wetteland was in the bullpen only because, with two recent 
off days, he has not started since Aug. 9, and will not start until this 
weekend in New York. . . . Philadelphia's John Kruk had a first-inning single 
to extend his hitting streak to 19 games. He was batting .194 when he was 
traded here from San Diego June 2. Since then he has gone 54 for 149 (.362) to 
improve his average to .302. The difference? "I'm happy here," Kruk said. "They 
like me here." . . . Eddie Murray broke out of a one-for-11 slump with three 
hits. . . . Philadelphia starter Dennis Cook has allowed homers in 10 
consecutive starts, 17 homers in 85 1/3 innings, 1.79 homers per nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor left the team with permission, flying to Boston to be examined by 
Red Sox physician Arthur Pappas. Tudor will rejoin the club in a few days. . . 
. On Tuesday Mickey Hatcher swung a bat for the first time since going on the 
disabled list Aug. 6 with a strained left hamstring. He said he felt good, and 
will probably be ready to return when he is eligible to leave the disabled list 
next week in Montreal.

JACK SMITH: HE'S GETTING A HANDLE ON ODD NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names parents give their offspring is a bottomless source of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
One reader has reviled me for what he calls cruelty in making fun of people's 
names. On the contrary, I find that most people with unusual, inventive or even 
silly names don't mind them. And of course they always have the legal right to 
change them. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Delores Trepagnier writes that she concedes that right to her daughter, 
whom she named Khaleilah (Ka-lee-la) Trepagnier. Mrs. Trepagnier explains that 
she considered her own name, Debra, to be "the most unoriginal name I have ever 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was doing her a favor. . . . Wouldn't you just know it -- she 
would have much preferred to be a Valerie or a Stephanie. I assured her she can 
legally change it at 18. I think she will like it by then. Don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Ka-lee-la? I like it already. 
</P>
<P>
I am gratified that several readers have written to confirm that some of the 
oddly named people I have mentioned indeed exist. Harry Cimring questioned the 
authenticity of Bathsheba Finkelstein, saying it was too reminiscent of Dawn 
Ginsbergh, one of S. J. Perelman's fictional characters. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Haun of Pacific Palisades writes that when she was 10 years old the 
Finkelsteins lived across the street from her best friend, Sheva Honigman. Moss 
Henken of Bakersfield says "Bathsheba is the name her proud parents gave her." 
He says Bathsheba is a Ph.D. "She teaches at an Eastern college where her 
husband is president." 
</P>
<P>
Marian S. Spencer of Santa Monica writes that the Colin B. Goodykoontz 
mentioned by Bill Noble of Palm Desert was her uncle -- Colin Brummit 
Goodykoontz, and she documents it with a page from her family's history. 
</P>
<P>
The name Carbon Petroleum Dubbs, reported by Maury Green, is abundantly 
verified. Maddie De Mott of Montecito says Dubbs came from Chicago in the 1930s 
and built a home near the Santa Barbara Biltmore. His name, she says, was 
derived from the industry that made his family rich. Warren Sherlock, a Loyola 
Marymount University professor, says that Dubbs' estate gave his beach home to 
the university. Harry Monahan sends an article from a 1975 SEA magazine 
describing Dubbs' adventures in his 60-foot yacht Bowditch, which he sailed 
from Scammon's Lagoon to the Alaskan ice fields. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Levitan vouches for Wooloomooloo Cleaves, whom Henry Cimring described as 
"a lady from Australia." Levitan says, "I sat next to her in one of my classes 
at Los Angeles Junior College (now City College)." 
</P>
<P>
I am pleased to report that at least two readers have authenticated the 
existence of Cheerful Hyacinth Apple, recalled by Vada Robeson as a girl her 
mother went to school with. Ida M. Hukill of Pico Rivera. "When we were kids," 
she writes, "Cheerful and I lived a block apart in Riverside. That was in the 
early 1900s." (Mrs. Hukill will be 93 in September.) 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John C. McMillan of Pomona writes: "My mother and father went to school 
with Cheerful Hyacinth Apple. My mother never forgot the name." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Violin, mentioned by Bill Wilson of Santa Barbara, writes that she 
indeed exists. "Personally, I really can't take full credit for this most 
interesting, unusual and musical name. For I received it as a gift from my 
husband, Efrem, nearly 37 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Just to keep the pot boiling, Douglas Mueller of Santa Barbara recalls an Ohio 
state welfare director named Xenophon G. Hassenpflug; Sue S. Loup recalls the 
daughter of an Italian bartender named Virgin Mary; a schoolteacher named 
Fairly Dull, and a schoolteacher in Baton Rouge, La., named Prince O. Wales. 
</P>
<P>
John T. Pigott recalls a partner in his former law firm named Cantwell Faulkner 
Muckenfuss III. He encloses an eight-page legal-size list of remarkable names 
compiled by a friend and his wife over several decades. Alas, I have room for 
only a few: Intha Gotch, Rosetta Stone, C. Sharp Minor, Ecstasy Goldfarb, Candy 
Barr (remember her?); and Tootsie Utz. 
</P>
<P>
David Kolpacoff of El Cajon also offers a long list, from which I have culled 
Dodie Bump, Comfort Igabon, Tina Pancake, Holly Lightfoot, Lorelei Loonie and 
Neil Gesundheit. 
</P>
<P>
A. F. Gonzales Jr. of San Diego says his all-time favorite is the name of a 
hotel public relations man in Miami: Bermuda Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth W. Whitaker nominates Jesse Basley Bentley Worth Pocahantas Gibson. 
"The Pocahantas alludes to a slight Indian ancestry."

ALICE KAHN: BARELY MANAGING ... WITHOUT THE YACHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A woman I know is going through her 13th mid-life crisis. "I'm sick of riding 
on other people's yachts," she told me. "I want one of my own." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is one of the tragic passage points in adult life. Realizing 
that you'll never be quite as filthy rich as you would like. So, my friend is 
making do with the Cadillac and the Acapulco cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Golda (let's call her) is one of those people who has lost perspective. It's 
easy to do at a time when every citizen seems to feel that the Constitution 
guarantees us the inalienable right to life, liberty and More Stuff Than We 
Know What to Do With. 
</P>
<P>
While a lot of attention has been focused on homelessness and poverty in 
America, I have been stunned by the flip side of the coin. How did so many 
people come to live like lords and ladies? 
</P>
<P>
You can walk around dozens of neighborhoods (if the cops don't stop you and ask 
why you're on foot) and see house after stately house with two gleaming cars in 
the driveway. Even if you don't own a house, you probably have at least one 
gleaming car. Even if you don't have one gleaming car, you probably have at 
least one amazing machine -- a computer or a VCR or a compact disc player or a 
phone-answering machine. Many of my friends have all of the above. They're just 
keeping up with the norm. 
</P>
<P>
I can easily recall when any one of these gizmos would have qualified you as a 
rich person. But rather than making us feel like rich people, our things seem 
to remind us only of the other things we don't have. We brood about not being 
King of the Hill like a nation of spoiled brats ("Boo hoo, I'm just the Duke of 
Earl"). 
</P>
<P>
You'd think we'd wake up from our misery and say, "Ya know, the materialism 
thing just isn't working." Instead we wake up and say, "I need cable." 
</P>
<P>
Oh. Me too. As soon as I got a new lamp for the solarium (get that -- the 
solarium!) I realized I needed new furniture to go with it. Otherwise, the new 
lamp stood out among all the old ugly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
A big problem with all these strange feelings of deprivation is the lack of 
sympathy from any but richer friends. That's why God invented therapists. 
</P>
<P>
When my poor yachtless friend told me she was seeing a therapist, I reminded 
her of some of her qualities. "You're a good parent," I told her, and in all 
honesty it's what I admire most about this person. "You were able to be one 
despite the fact that your own parents weren't the greatest role models." 
</P>
<P>
"They were the worst," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now wait a minute," I reminded her. "Think of parents on a continuum, with 
'Father Knows Best' at one end and keeping the kid locked in a cage on the 
other. You were somewhere in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Then she said, "I was an abused child." 
</P>
<P>
We talked about this at length. My friend was never hit or physically molested 
in any way. She was never neglected. Her parents loved her and hugged her a 
lot. They weren't the brightest, most sophisticated people, and they didn't 
give her everything she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
We're abusing the concept of abuse. It's part of the lost sense of proportion 
in the goofy world of haves and have-mores. 
</P>
<P>
I'm thinking of organizing walking tours on the poor side of town. (The cops 
won't stop us there.) Maybe we need to become poverty voyeurs to see through 
the warped norm.

NEW AND USEFUL: A DECOY TO THWART CAR-STEREO BURGLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's the latest wrinkle in the car stereo security department: RadioGard, 
developed by a Manhattan Beach inventor who came up with the device after his 
Porsche's stereo was stolen three times. Staring at the tangle of wires hanging 
from the dash where his radio had been, Gerald Levinson decided that if it 
looked that way all the time, the stereo never again would be ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
So he designed the decoy Radio-Gard, which attaches with Velcro-type adhesive 
over a car stereo. A mass of wires protruding from the black cover creates the 
illusion that the unit already has been stolen. No two of the devices are 
alike, because he varies the colors and thicknesses of the wires and terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 different colors of wire used in radio installation, so when we 
put in the wires at random, each unit produced is different," he explained. 
"There are so many cars on the street that already look like this that the 
thieves -- most are what I call the 'Three D's,' derelicts, drug addicts and 
delinquents -- can't tell whether the radio has really been stolen or not. 
Professionals can't either. I've tested prototypes for the past year on the 
streets of New York and Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
RadioGard costs $9.95, plus $2.05 for postage and handling, and comes with a 
money-back guarantee. It can be ordered from Radio-Gard Systems, 3408 Manhattan 
Ave., Manhattan Beach 90266.

Portable Air Cooler 
</P>
<P>
Summer heat getting to your family? Consider a new air conditioner that is 
portable and that cools a room using two condenser systems, one run on water, 
the other on air. 
</P>
<P>
The Pinguino, introduced by DeLonghi America Inc., Europe's leading 
manufacturer of household appliances, automatically switches condensers for 
maximum efficiency, a DeLonghi spokesman said. It has a 3.7-gallon water tank 
that can keep the main condenser cool for about eight hours, "easily cooling a 
12x15-foot room." When the water runs out, it shifts to an air-cooled 
condenser, similar to those in regular air-conditioning units; it uses 
fan-forced air to cool the system and dehumidifies as it works. 
</P>
<P>
The unit is mounted on four wheels. It weighs 97 pounds and is 28 3/8 inches 
high, 22 inches wide and 14 1/2 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
It comes with an extendable plastic hose that is connected to an included 
window bracket, which is secured when the window is closed on it. It also can 
be installed permanently with the 3 1/2-inch vent fixture provided. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for the unit is $1,250. In Southern California, it is 
available at Chung's Appliances in Los Angeles. If you can't find a store in 
your area that carries the unit, write DeLonghi America Inc., 625 Washington

What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?: Growing Up German by Sabine Reichel (Hill 
&amp; Wang/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: $17.95; 214 pages) 
</P>
<P>
About halfway through "What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?" by Sabine Reichel, a 
short but earnest book about growing up in postwar Germany, we come across 
something truly and profoundly horrifying -- an arithmetic exercise from a 
textbook that was used in German schools during the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
"If a mental patient costs 4 Reichsmarks a day in maintenance, a cripple 5.50, 
and a criminal 3.50, and about 50,000 of these people are in our institutions, 
how much does it cost our state at a daily rate of 4 Reichsmarks -- and how 
many marriage loans of 1,000 Reichsmarks per couple could have been given out 
instead?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nazification in the '30s 
</P>
<P>
This ominous "word problem," suffused as it is with vile and wholly evil 
assumptions, is recounted to Reichel by a schoolteacher who witnessed the 
"Nazification" of the German schools in the '30s. I was reminded that the Nazis 
first experimented with poison gas to murder the mentally and physically 
handicapped patients in their own hospitals before using the same technique on 
a much grander scale to kill 6 million Jews. And, suddenly, I began to 
understand how a whole nation could be led so readily into genocide. 
</P>
<P>
That, I suppose, is the author's real purpose in "What Did You Do in the War, 
Daddy?" Sabine Reichel, born in Hamburg in 1946, is an articulate and 
thoughtful woman with a restless moral curiosity about her nation and, 
especially, her parents. Although Reichel has lived in the United States since 
1976, where she has worked as a clothing designer and a journalist, she 
returned to Germany to seek out the answers to her insistent and uncompromising 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the historian in me that needed to come to terms with the past, but 
anger and outrage against people who had betrayed me by their silence, 
crippling me by their refusal to speak," Reichel writes. "Back to Germany, back 
to the source of the pain. Psychoanalysis on a nation's couch. My mission: soul 
espionage. I felt like an archeologist excavating a rare find, a detective in 
search of a lost time and the missing conscience of a country." 
</P>
<P>
Reichel is preoccupied, naturally enough, with her own parents. Although 
Reichel has interviewed and written about other Germans who were somewhat 
closer to worst crimes of the Third Reich, she devotes much of her short book 
to her own urbane father, an actor who entertained Nazi troops in occupied 
countries and later served as a radio announcer, and her vivacious mother, a 
Lithuanian hausfrau who saw herself as a "displaced person" because she ended 
up in Berlin during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are German fathers such a problem? It is their fate to be linked to a 
reprehensible crime that was carried out in their name, and they will never 
rise above suspicion as long as they live," Reichel writes. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, however, Sabine's father was not a war criminal -- indeed, he 
claims to have played a rather distant and speculative role in the failed 
effort to assassinate Hitler. (The story is a bit obscure and, in any event, 
impossible to verify: "I'll never know for sure what he did or didn't do in the 
war," Reichel writes.) And Reichel's problems with her father seem more 
generational than moral: "He saw himself as one of the world's most original 
gifts to mankind. My father was not so much a Nazi as he was a narcissist." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even Reichel's father gives voice to the moral complacency that, 
according to the author, characterized a whole generation of Germans: 
"Everything that was good in the Third Reich wasn't new, and everything that 
was new wasn't good," he quips. "Actually, economically the war had advantages. 
It wasn't bad that we had to start anew. Germany looks much nicer now -- except 
for Dresden maybe." 
</P>
<P>
Reichel's mother is depicted as a victim of a peculiarly nasty strain of sexism 
("The war stole the best years of my life") and the seductive materialism of 
the "economic miracle" of the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confronting Nation's Amnesia 
</P>
<P>
When she is not musing over the fate of her own parents, however, Reichel is 
willing to grapple with the ugliest realities of the Nazi era and its lingering 
shadows in contemporary Germany. Reichel tries very hard to be honest, blunt 
and uncompromising, and she mostly succeeds. She always comes back to the 
central theme of her book -- the moral and historical amnesia of the German 
nation -- and she never flinches from her self-assigned role as the voice of 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
"The terrible truth is that Hitler's murderous task, euphemistically called 
'the final solution of the Jewish question,' was completed successfully," she 
writes. "When I was born, Germany was indeed Judenrein (free of Jews), not just 
numerically but also in the conscience of the Germans. They killed the Jews 
twice -- first their bodies, then their souls." 
</P>
<P>
I must confess that, as an American Jew only one generation removed from the 
Holocaust, I was distressed by Reichel's book. Can we explain away her good 
conscience as a strictly postwar phenomenon or, what's even worse, as an 
aberration? Still, we must welcome Reichel and salute her efforts at 
truth-telling, even if we wish that there had been more Germans like her when 
it really counted.

JAZZ NOTES : COMPTON CLUB'S OPENING IS DELAYED AGAIN; FREE BILL HOLMAN CONCERT 
AT LACMA

<P>
Today's scheduled opening of the Indigo Jazz Club, situated in the soon-to-open 
Compton Lazben Hotel, has been postponed for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a partial solution to our financial situation and thought things were 
OK, so we announced the opening date," said Jona Liebrecht, president of the 
Lazben Corp., which will manage the club and the hotel. "But we were a little 
premature." 
</P>
<P>
The complex is now expected to open in about a month. It had originally been 
scheduled to open early this year. 
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between the city and a private corporation, Tucon Development, 
the complex was characterized as a "somewhat difficult venture" by Liebrecht. 
"There have been some some difficulties and some misunderstandings, but they 
are being reconciled," he said. "There are no conflicting interests now, 
everybody wants us to open soon, so I'm very optimistic. We should open by 
mid-September but I won't announce another opening date until all finances are 
in place." 
</P>
<P>
Liebrecht declined to offer further details. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a construction delay, mostly painting, installation of rugs and 
wallpaper, basically decorations," said Ozzie Cadena, who is in charge of 
entertainment for the 160-seat Indigo club, as well as the 700-seat Count Basie 
Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Of the musicians scheduled for this week -- who included saxophonist Clifford 
Jordan, trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison and the Woody Herman Orchestra, led by 
Frank Tiberi -- Cadena said: "I canceled them, without remuneration. I'll try 
to get them dates here later on. Sweets, since he lives nearby, knows he'll get 
plenty of work when we open." 
</P>
<P>
Cadena was able to set up an engagement for the Herman band, which was to play 
the Basie ballroom Monday and Tuesday. The ensemble will appear at 7 and 10 
p.m. Monday at the Hermosa Beach Civic Center, in an event sponsored by local 
merchants. Information: (213) 379-3312. 
</P>
<P>
HOLMAN'S MUSEUM GIG: Bill Holman, a Grammy winner in the instrumental 
arrangement category in 1987 (for "Take the 'A' Train," as recorded by Doc 
Severinsen's Tonight Show Orchestra), is a busy guy. Between playing and 
writing arrangements here and in Europe, it's a wonder he has time for his free 
concert Sunday, 2 p.m. at the Times Mirror Court of the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Holman, who gained renown writing arrangements for Stan Kenton, Woody Herman 
and Buddy Rich, is happy Severinsen continues to commission work from him. "I 
can write pretty much as I want to," said the 62-year-old 
composer-arranger-saxophonist, whose latest release is "The Bill Holman Band" 
(JVC). "His is the one of the few bands left that are buying arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Holman said he has recently completed a version of "Royal Garden Blues" for 
Severinsen, and is about to tackle "Be My Love." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the late '50s, when Herman was one of his clients, Holman chided the 
bandleader for playing one of his arrangements too fast. " 'We usually tell 
arrangers who don't like the tempos to start their own band,' Woody told me," 
said Holman, and eventually, he did. 
</P>
<P>
That band has been extant since 1975 and though it performs irregularly, Holman 
leads his players through rehearsals once a week at the Musicians' Union on 
Vine Street in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get away from feeling you're a musician in this town unless you're 
active, so since that's the only live activity I partake in (except for 
occasional appearances with fellow tenorman Bill Perkins), I enjoy these 
rehearsals," he said. "Plus it helps us sound good, and be ready for a gig at 
instant notice." 
</P>
<P>
Holman's musical menu has for several years included trips to Europe, most 
often to Cologne, where he appeared in April with the West German Radio Network 
Orchestra. Phil Woods was an added guest star. "I wrote some charts featuring 
Phil, including one long original called 'Springfield Nights,' " said Holman. 
"We recorded these for the radio's library and also did a concert." Holman said 
he may go to Britain in October but will definitely travel to Denmark in 
December, where a local big band has asked him to bring some charts -- and his 
horn. "While I'm there, I may do a few clinics, maybe even a couple of club 
dates," Holman said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 5905 Wilshire Blvd. Information: (213) 857-6000.

The records continue to be broken as "Batman" wings its way overseas. The 
blockbuster hit has now become the first movie in British history to gross more 
than 2 million (about $3.4 million) on its opening weekend. That's nearly 20% 
more than the gross of any previous picture, Warner Bros. said. "Batman," 
produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, directed by Tim Burton and starring 
Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, crushed all previous box-office records with 
a gross of 2.9 million pounds at 400 theaters. The film also broke all standing 
single-day records. Claudia Puig

LENNON: TIME TO ACCEPT IDENTITY WITH HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conversation overheard in the men's room at the Wiltern Theatre on Monday, near 
the end of Julian Lennon's concert: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. A: "That's it. I'm outta here!" 
</P>
<P>
Mr. B: "Is he just playing the same song over and over?" 
</P>
<P>
Mr. A: "And where're the Beatles songs? He's supposed to play some Beatles. 
That's what I came for." 
</P>
<P>
Poor Jude! The harder he tries to escape the ghost of his father John, the more 
tenaciously some people hold on to the mythic connection. 
</P>
<P>
Julian did his part: The only overt references to his father came in the form 
of a couple of Beatlesque songs, a forced aside (introducing his new song 
"Mother Mary," Lennon cautioned, "This is not part B of 'Let It Be' "), and his 
version of John Lennon's version of "Stand By Me." Mr. A might have been 
displeased, but a crowd of squealing teeny-boppers and loyal adult fans was 
quite satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately, as Mr. B's more justified criticism pointed out, young 
Lennon is not establishing his own identity very well. It's not for lack of 
trying: With his goatee and faded black tank-top and jeans he looked more like 
Roy Scheider in "All That Jazz" than you-know-who, and he's often singing in a 
lower register that resembles David Bowie more than whatsizname, while his 
young band provides an overbearing, Power Station-ish sound. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Wiltern it all added up to a case of trying too hard. Lennon has 
considerable (and unquestionably hereditary) vocal skills and a noteworthy way 
with a tune. But both aspects would benefit from a less bombastic and more 
personal and intimate approach. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, the most appealing and distinctive things about Julian Lennon do 
resemble John Lennon. And the best way for him to get on with his own artistic 
life would be to accept that and work with it, rather than fight against it. 
Who knows, he might even be able to please both Mr. A and Mr. B. STEVE HOCHMAN

THE DETOURS WITH POTHOLES 'DOWN THE ROAD'

<TEXT>
<P>
What makes serial killers tick? Why are their numbers growing? What kind of a 
society is it that spawns them? 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Lee Blessing has set himself the impossible task of answering these 
questions. But his new play, "Down the Road," which opened Sunday at the La 
Jolla Playhouse under the direction of Des McAnuff, is as stumped as the 
sociologists. 
</P>
<P>
Blessing, who wrote two other plays staged by McAnuff at La Jolla ("A Walk in 
the Woods," about the private talks of an American and a Soviet arms 
negotiator, and "Two Rooms," about the effects on his family of the taking of a 
political hostage), has made a mini-science of the small-cast, big-issue play. 
</P>
<P>
The approach worked best in "Walk." In "Down the Road," a three-way exploration 
of serial killing, Blessing's formula has reached a dead end. He raises the 
hard questions and, when he can't answer them, aborts the play. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Iris and Dan Henniman (Susan Berman and Jonathan Hogan) have landed a 
terrific assignment. They're going to do the book on the life of serial killer 
Bill Reach (James Morrison). Reach, in some forsaken federal prison, is eager 
to cooperate. Dollar signs fairly dance off the project. Think paperbacks, 
think film and television. 
</P>
<P>
Iris and Dan jauntily take up residence in a motel room 10 miles from the 
penitentiary. Ambiance is set up: The view from the window is a rusting water 
heater on someone's front porch. The best restaurant around is McDonald's. And 
it's only going to get tougher, they fairly cluck, as it goes along. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the joys of the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Iris is the experienced interviewer, Dan the novice. For that reason, she tells 
Dan, he must interview Reach first -- set him up while she goes in for the 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
If this hints at sexual politics, Blessing soon drops the ball. Dan's first 
interview proves Iris right. His technique is lousy: He talks too much, asks 
too many leading questions, apologizes a lot. No wonder Reach quickly gains the 
upper hand. This is a guy who knows how to apply a stranglehold. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, he also strangles the play. Blessing made a serious tactical error 
when he decided to allow Reach to talk only about his crimes, never his 
motivations. He's darn proud to have killed 19 women, maybe more. But every 
time he's asked one of those $64 questions about why he killed (as opposed to 
how), Reach clams up. 
</P>
<P>
No talkee, no play. 
</P>
<P>
So we're faced with a double negative: the interview overused as a means of 
disseminating fundamentally dull if needed exposition -- and a protagonist who 
won't speak when it comes to examining what the play's about. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to focus on the large issues, Blessing belabors the small ones: Iris and 
Dan's marital chatter, their separate fantasies, the rusting water heater, a 
forced outrage at this murderer's evil (what did they expect?), topped by an 
ending not organically connected to the play. 
</P>
<P>
Iris, who has become pregnant in the course of the investigation, suddenly 
decides she doesn't want to go on with a project that has become distasteful. 
(Why is not made especially clear, though a thin thread of reason is 
established between her impending motherhood and Reach's killing of a 
10-year-old girl.) 
</P>
<P>
More inexplicably, the marriage threatens to fall apart when Dan suggests that 
he has the right to go on with the project alone. There is lots of indignation 
and even a curious tape-burning scene that can only charitably be described as 
borrowed from "Hedda Gabler." 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff moves everybody around nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member cast is able, though the play makes no heavy-duty demands on 
anyone. Blessing is skillful at engaging banter. His husband-and-wife scenes 
are lively. But there's no real play around them -- just a collection of catch 
phrases and non-answers such as "He's on the news because he is the news" or 
"Men like him should be studied, not publicized." 
</P>
<P>
"Men like him" are not studied here. Neither -- and more importantly -- is the 
money-grubbing central issue of why there are always writers like Dan and Iris 
ready to publicize them. Why do serial killers kill? Someone has yet to provide 
the answer.

RETIRED GEN. MINORU GENDA, 84; PLANNED RAID ON PEARL HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Gen. Minoru Genda, architect of the fateful Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, which brought the United States into World War II, died 
Tuesday, ironically on the 44th anniversary of V-J Day. The pilot and 
politician was 84. 
</P>
<P>
He died of heart failure in Minami Takai Hospital where he had been a patient 
since Aug. 4, hospital spokesmen said. The facility is in Matsuyama on Shikoku, 
Japan's smallest main island. 
</P>
<P>
A 1937 graduate of Japan's Naval Academy, the Hiroshima native was a staff 
officer with the Japanese Imperial Air Fleet at the time of Pearl Harbor. Genda 
later said he flew a torpedo bomber in the raid but did not hit anything. 
</P>
<P>
Genda had made a name for himself by introducing sharpshooting and aerobatic 
teams to the Imperial Navy Air Corps, earning his unit the nickname Genda's 
Circus. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Genda was taught to fly jets by American pilots whom he 
described as "a wonderful, congenial bunch of men." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Genda became the first pilot named chief of staff of Japan's Air 
Self-Defense Force. After his retirement in 1962, he ran successfully for the 
upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, and was returned to the chamber 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
Genda's comments in Europe and the United States about the war sometimes caused 
him trouble with his Liberal Democratic Party. In 1969, he was forced to resign 
from the party's Defense Police Board because of statements that Japan probably 
would have used the atomic bomb if it had had one during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he spoke only "as a soldier," Genda said repeatedly that Japan 
should have crushed Pearl Harbor that fateful morning in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not have attacked just once," he said in several speeches. "We 
should have attacked again and again." 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the appraisal during a 1968 visit to Los Angeles, while touring a 
20th Century Fox Film Corp. studio where props were being constructed for the 
film "Tora! Tora! Tora!" The film depicted Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Genda aroused controversy on this side of the Pacific when he received the U.S. 
Legion of Merit degree of commander, the highest U.S. award given to 
foreigners. The medal was presented in 1962 upon Genda's military retirement by 
Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, then chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff. 
Lemnitzer praised Genda for his leadership of the postwar air force and his 
cooperation with the U.S. forces in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Disabled American Veterans officially protested the award. 
</P>
<P>
Genda, the father of three, retired from politics in 1986.

HOPES OF A NEW LETTER CARRIER WERE CRUSHED ON A RURAL ROAD

<P>
Mark Feest knew it was a step in the right direction when he took a temporary 
job last spring as a rural postal carrier in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it wasn't a real job just yet -- he wouldn't receive any benefits until 
he was hired on full time. But it was a way out of the bartending business, the 
long hours on his feet with little or no job security. 
</P>
<P>
And, since his wife, Cecilia, was pregnant with their first child, Feest knew 
he needed to make some bold stroke as family provider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Road Was So Narrow His Wife Was Worried 
</P>
<P>
So he was excited that Sunday morning as he took his wife on a tour of his 
first official assignment: the route he would work as a vacation replacement, 
part of which stretched along a busy section of Rancho Santa Fe Road in 
Olivenhain. 
</P>
<P>
The scene, however, made Cecilia Feest uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous," she recalled. "I was very pregnant, and I didn't like 
the way people were driving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in our own car, but the road was so narrow I could imagine how Mark 
would have to hug the curb in that postal Jeep to avoid getting hit." 
</P>
<P>
On April 11 -- his second day on the route and only six weeks after he started 
as a mailman -- Feest was rammed from behind by a pickup as he sat in his 
vehicle in the 900 block of North Rancho Santa Fe Road. 
</P>
<P>
Feest, 35, never knew what hit him. He remained unconscious for days before 
waking up in a hospital intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first morning of his new life. The impact, Feest learned, had 
shattered the vertebrae in his back, paralyzing him from the chest down. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday -- four months after the accident -- Feest left Sharp Memorial 
Hospital's rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
Now he and his family face an abyss of uncertainty, along with the problems 
posed to a man in a wheelchair looking to provide for his 7-week-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The family is living in a hotel until they find a suitable apartment, one 
without steps or severe turns so Feest can negotiate his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
After looking at more than 100 places, Cecilia finally found one in Encinitas 
last weekend. But, when the owner learned of Feest's wheelchair, he became 
concerned about the couple's earning power and insisted on a month-to-month 
lease. So, the day after moving in, Cecilia moved the baby, Jenna, and their 
belongings back out. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my worst nightmare come true," Feest said. "I knew delivering mail was 
no walk in the park. But I never thought I would break a leg, much less all of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Feest, a soft-spoken man with an easy smile, has hired an attorney and filed a 
claim against the city of Encinitas, contending that the road that robbed him 
of his legs is a dangerous place. The couple is also considering a suit against 
the driver of the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars just move too quickly on that road," Feest said. "And there's not 
much shoulder room where I have to pull over, especially in that stretch of 
town." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Decades Ago 
</P>
<P>
The incident highlights a persistent problem in many North County communities: 
Older two-lane roads, some built decades ago with only rural vehicles in mind, 
cannot support today's suburban traffic -- the cars, buses, pickups, campers 
and postal vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In cities such as Encinitas, residents claim, the reluctance to widen existing 
roads stems from a fear that increased traffic from suburban shortcutters and 
Sunday drivers would mar the city's small-town feel and pose a hazard to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a few pockets of people who, for one reason or another, want to keep 
the area rural. And, to them, rural means winding country roads," said Gerald 
Bode, an Olivenhain resident who has written letters to community boards about 
the problem. "There are a few roads out here, let me tell you, that are 
disasters waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Bode says Rancho Santa Fe Road is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too narrow in many areas, and there's no left-turn lanes," he said. "It's 
basically the same road as when I moved here 16 years ago. And I'm willing to 
bet it carries 10 to 20 times as much traffic as it did then. But, other than 
put up a couple of stop signs, little has been done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Question of the Day 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dominguez, an executive assistant to former county Supervisor Lee Taylor, 
said Encinitas has had opportunities to improve its older roads. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the big questions of the day when I left in 1979," he said. "But 
there's been such an accelerated evolution there with incorporation and such. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who opposed the roads then are now the elected representatives of 
the area. So you can imagine why not much has been done." 
</P>
<P>
The city's new general plan, adopted this year, precludes the building of 
Highway 680, which would connect Interstates 5 and 15. Encinitas has since been 
sued by residents in Rancho Santa Fe for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Although plans have been made to extend Leucadia Boulevard between I-5 and El 
Camino Real, providing another east-west artery, other streets have been 
declared private drives and closed off by gates, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Will Get Worse 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a woman sued the city after one such gate temporarily failed to open 
for paramedics trying to reach her injured husband, who subsequently died. 
</P>
<P>
The problem will get worse. A study by the city's general-plan consultants 
concludes that traffic will increase 81% by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Warren Shafer said the issue is that of keeping through traffic 
from residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are roads in the community that are seeing a lot more traffic 
than they have in the past," he said. "That raises people's concerns that 
widening those roads would only bring more traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"And you have to answer the question, 'What volume of traffic do you want on 
them?' " 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of Rancho Santa Fe Road through Olivenhain, where Feest's accident 
occurred, doesn't seem to be a problem, Shafer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traveling Too Fast? 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic there isn't beyond the service capabilities of the road, and 
that's what traffic engineers look for," he said. "It sounds to me like there 
were other factors involved in the accident." 
</P>
<P>
Police say the pickup was traveling too fast for road conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Feest says that, since the accident, at least two mailboxes near the scene have 
been moved back from the road. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service in San Diego, said the agency 
has embarked on a nationwide program to relocate dangerous mailboxes in rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Between October, 1987, and October, 1988, 11 postal carriers died nationwide 
out of a total of 18,315 accidents involving postal vehicles. During that time, 
mailmen drove more than 548 million miles, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, what can you do?" he said. "We have driver training courses and 
supervisors on the street who surreptitiously observe workers to see if they're 
following the rules. But what can you do about the other guy?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accident Hit Home 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, friends and co-workers of Mark and Cecilia Feest have 
raised thousands of dollars through collections at work and benefits at local 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of Feest's $250,000 hospital bill has been covered by worker's 
compensation, the Feests have no long-term insurance policy through the Postal 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
"The accident really hit everyone here, and we've tried to show our support," 
said Kristy Kremer, acting postmaster in Encinitas. "Everyone in the post 
office has been a carrier and has been exposed to the dangers. So they can 
relate to what happened to Mark. Because it could have been them." 
</P>
<P>
Feest has given up asking himself why it happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a futile question; it can never be answered," he said. "I can't come 
to accept it. I just have to deal with it. But I still tell myself that, if I'd 
just left a little bit sooner that day -- or even later -- I wouldn't have been 
there when that truck went by." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lucky to Be Alive 
</P>
<P>
Doctors tell him he's lucky to be alive. For a while, though, he didn't think 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Since he has little control of his trunk muscles -- which would allow him to 
lean forward without falling -- he wonders whether he'll ever be able to return 
to even an office job. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of people in the hospital worse off than I am," he said. "It's 
a sad consequence, but it keeps me going. I still have my arms and I can hold 
Jenna and hug Ceci. And that means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Other wheelchair patients have offered Feest inspiration. And, since his 
daughter was born at Sharp, Feest was able to be in the delivery room during 
her birth, holding his wife's hand. 
</P>
<P>
"After Jenna was born, Mark and his friends from the rehab center would wheel 
down every day to see her and hold her," Cecilia said. "I know it meant a lot 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest thing for me is Jenna," Feest said, tears in his eyes as he held 
his daughter. "How can I help out? . . . What kind of father am I going to be?" 
</P>

LYLES TO WAGE WRITE-IN DRIVE FOR ASSEMBLY BERTH IN 76TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring himself "ready to climb a political mountain," Republican businessman 
Dick Lyles, undeterred by his narrow loss in last week's special 76th Assembly 
District primary, announced Tuesday that he plans to launch a write-in campaign 
in this fall's runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that he faces some "very sobering" obstacles -- not least of which is 
opposition from local and state party officials -- Lyles said that the more 
than 1,000 calls and letters of support he received over the past week 
convinced him that a successful write-in campaign "not only is possible, but 
very possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chances Admittedly Slim 
</P>
<P>
"The odds are tough, no doubt about it," said Lyles, who finished about 200 
votes behind fellow Republican Tricia Hunter in the eight-candidate primary. 
"This is a very big mountain to climb. But we've got a bunch of climbers ready 
to help us reach the top." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' refusal to abide by the primary result, combined with the formidable 
difficulties that face any write-in candidacy, causes his write-in bid in the 
Oct. 3 runoff against Hunter and Democrat Jeannine Correia to be alternately 
viewed as quixotic, vindictive and inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about the prospects of a badly divided Republican vote, some GOP 
leaders expressed concern Tuesday that Lyles' write-in candidacy will give at 
least a glint of hope to Correia, whose chances in the heavily Republican San 
Diego-Riverside County district normally would be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter and her supporters, meanwhile, predictably decried, in Hunter's words, 
Lyles' "refusal to accept voters' decision and his own party's candidate" in 
the special race to elect a successor to the late Bill Bradley (R-Escondido). 
</P>
<P>
"This just shows that he's obsessed with getting elected," said Irene Agnos, 
director of government relations for the California Nurses Assn., a group that 
spent nearly $100,000 in the primary for Hunter, a Bonita nurse. 
</P>
<P>
But others, in particular anti-abortion activists ideologically aligned with 
Lyles on the volatile issue, applauded his decision to offer an alternative in 
the runoff to the pro-choice position shared by Hunter and Correia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Welcome News' 
</P>
<P>
"This is very welcome news," said the Rev. Billy Falling, head of the 
Escondido-based Christian Voters League, a fundamentalist religious and 
political group. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a successful write-in candidacy by Dick Lyles, a pro-abortion 
assemblyman . . . not representative of this district would have been 
guaranteed election. This gives voters a choice." 
</P>
<P>
Though the primary was widely viewed as a referendum on the U. S. Supreme 
Court's recent abortion ruling, Lyles insisted that his write-in decision 
</P>
<P>
is not merely an effort to perpetuate the issue's importance in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest factor in deciding to continue on was all the support I've gotten 
in the last week," Lyles said. "Many people told me they felt shut out, that 
there was no one on the ballot who they could cast a sincere vote for. They 
also said they were offended that outside interest groups might determine the 
district's representation." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to pattern his admittedly uphill effort after the successful 1982 
write-in race of Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), Lyles explained that his focus 
over the next six weeks will be "a person-to-person education campaign" aimed 
at simply informing voters how to cast a write-in ballot. On Election Day, 
Lyles hopes to have 1,000 volunteers at the polls to remind voters. 
</P>
<P>
However, Packard's stunning write-in victory -- only the fourth in 
congressional history -- is clearly the exception. Officials in the San Diego 
County voter registrar's office said Tuesday that there has not been a 
successful state legislative write-in campaign in memory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Different Kind of Election' 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most daunting question facing Lyles -- as it does all write-ins -- 
is also the simplest: How can a candidate who could not win when his name was 
on the ballot hope to succeed when his name does not appear there? 
</P>
<P>
Lyles answers that question by pointing out that the runoff will be "a very 
different kind of election" than the primary, in which the Republican vote was 
split among six GOP candidates, plus two others whose names remained on the 
ballot despite their withdrawal. Also, his preferred interpretation of Hunter's 
31% first-place finish emphasizes that "nearly 70% of the voters voted for 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't think the support (was) there, I wouldn't waste my time," Lyles 
said. "But my feeling is that, since the primary, my base has solidified and 
Tricia's has deteriorated." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, however, attributes Lyles' write-in candidacy to electoral sour grapes 
and his refusal to accept that he lost a race that he began as the clear 
front-runner after having spent nearly four years preparing for it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's putting himself above the voters," Hunter said. "I still expect to win, 
but this could cause a lot of pain and division within the party." 
</P>
<P>
That potential is what most concerns Republican leaders, who are displeased 
that there is any doubt whatsoever that the party will hold onto a seat in 
which the GOP has an intimidating 54%-33% registration edge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrat Takes Heart 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by the Hunter-Lyles split, Correia optimistically argues that 
Democrats now have reason to regard her campaign as more than just the "usual 
lost cause." Predicting that Lyles' write-in bid will be a boon to her own 
campaign, Correia added: "If nothing else, this will sure make the next six 
weeks a lot more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders, however, view that assessment as wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the district's so strongly Republican that we don't have to worry," 
said San Diego County Republican Chairman Bettie Kujawa. "But this is a 
divisive thing," she said of the write-in campaign. "It creates a problem that 
normally wouldn't be there." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to minimize any political damage, Kujawa has sent a letter to Republican 
Central Committee members reminding them that Hunter is the party's official 
nominee and that, as such, "we will be assisting in her campaign when 
requested." Any party official who works against Hunter could face expulsion 
from the committee, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, state Republican Chairman Frank Visco said Tuesday that he intends 
to "do whatever I can to discourage" support for Lyles' write-in effort. Though 
he asked party leaders to investigate the Lyles' campaign allegations of 
Democratic involvement in Hunter's campaign, Visco stressed that he "canceled 
that directive, since nothing but rumor and innuendo has come forward." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backing Might Falter 
</P>
<P>
A cautionary note was also sounded by a spokesman for Assembly Minority Leader 
Ross Johnson, who in the primary sent out a fund-raising letter on Lyles' 
behalf to GOP contributors. In that letter, Johnson, without naming Hunter, 
implied that she was linked to "liberal special-interest groups and labor 
unions with close ties" to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and San Francisco 
Mayor Art Agnos. 
</P>
<P>
Raising doubts about whether Lyles can expect such backing from the Assembly 
Republican Caucus in the runoff, Johnson spokesman Anne Richards said Tuesday 
that "no decision has been made or even discussed" on that point. Within the 
next week, in fact, Johnson plans to meet with Hunter, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles acknowledges he is not counting on "official support" from party 
officials, but he said he expects the strong support he drew from Republican 
regulars in the primary to be repeated in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look upon this in terms of splitting the party or hurting voters," 
Lyles said.

FORUMS WILL ADDRESS MALAISE AMONG POSTAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a shooting rampage that left two postal workers slain and 
another dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, San Diego County postal 
authorities announced Tuesday a series of "quality circles" in which workers' 
complaints will be addressed in an open forum. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Reed, director of field operations, said she and county Postmaster Margaret 
Sellers met for two hours on Monday with unhappy workers at a postal station in 
El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said "quality circles," in which workers openly discuss problems and air 
complaints, will occur periodically at post offices across the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had four suicides and two murders among county postal workers in just 
the last few years," Reed said. "Needless to say, something like that would 
disturb anybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Exploding' Postal Problems 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said he had met with Reed and two other officials 
Monday in an effort to pinpoint why postal problems seem to be "exploding" in 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Four suicides and two murders. . . . Just the fact that these things happened, 
whether they're related to poor working conditions or not, is enough to shake 
you up," Bates said by telephone from his home in Washington. "We have to do 
what we can to get to the bottom of such unhappiness." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the U.S. Postal Service is facing "major change" nationwide, but the 
problems in San Diego County are exacerbated by what he termed "unbelievable" 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the areas in my district, Otay Mesa, now serves something like 20,000 
people, but, because of budget restrictions, they don't have a post office," 
Bates said. "They have only a small contract station that's terribly 
overburdened. In West Encanto, at the corner of 69th and Imperial, they have 
only this tiny post office serving a massive number of addresses. Just imagine 
the stresses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Minor Grumbling' 
</P>
<P>
Reed said she and other officials had heard "only minor grumbling" from the El 
Cajon post office for "two to three years," but that recently discontent had 
reached a crescendo. It stirred again last week, when Escondido postal worker 
John Merlin Taylor walked into the Orange Glen substation where he was employed 
and killed two co-workers, then fatally wounded himself. 
</P>
<P>
On July 21, William Camp, a recently retired El Cajon letter carrier, committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I specifically am going to meet with 
</P>
<P>
the workers in El Cajon once a week every week for as long as I need to," Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said El Cajon employees had complained about dramatic increases in the 
volume of mail and routes not being changed to reflect the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Several workers were complaining that the lag time of restoring their routes 
to the customary eight-hour day was too long," Reed said. "They complained of 
not understanding our promotion procedures. They said, 'How do you guys decide 
promotions?' Some want to start earlier in the morning, to get a quicker handle 
on the volume of mail. Just recently, the starting time at El Cajon was 
switched from 6:30 to 7:30 in the morning, and a lot of people were very upset 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Times a Result of Curfew 
</P>
<P>
Reed said that starting times at county post offices are often the result of 
San Diego's location and of Lindbergh Field having a flight curfew. Mail from 
other parts of the country simply does not arrive until later than it should, 
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"And even I feel we should have more autonomy at the local level," she said. "I 
think everyone along the line feels that way. I want a lot of changes that we 
don't seem able to make. . . . The Postal Service is a big organization, and 
change in a big organization is like pushing an elephant. It happens very 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said many in the Postal Service see its problems as a microcosm of a 
troubled society. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 800,000 people," she said. "We're the largest civilian employer in the 
world. We have more change going on right now than we've had in our history. 
We're struggling with automation and with competition -- from the parcel 
business, the overnight mail business and even with advertising concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of change all at once, not to mention what's happening outside our 
doors . . . in the world at large."

TRIALS FOR ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS ARE POSTPONED FOR SECOND TIME IN MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trials scheduled to begin today for 134 anti-abortion activists were postponed 
Tuesday for a week, the second such delay this month. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge John M. Thompson ordered the trials to begin a week 
from today. The trials were first set to begin Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, acting at a pretrial conference, had to rearrange the schedule 
because a single protester -- William R. Lehman, 29, alleged to be a leader of 
the activists -- had not waived his right to a speedy trial, said James M. 
Bishop, head deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, who listed a Vista address, cannot be located, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flexibility Lacking 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the scheduling flexibility that a waiver would give, Thompson ordered 
that Lehman's case, and those of seven other protesters facing misdemeanor 
conspiracy charges, go first, beginning next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Trial of the others, who have agreed to waive their speedy trial right, will 
follow consecutively, he ordered. Thompson estimated last week that the series 
of trials could take as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters face misdemeanor charges in connection with arrests April 8 and 
29 and June 10 at San Diego-area clinics. Those charges include trespass, 
failure to disperse, resisting arrest and the eight conspiracy charges, Bishop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, prosecutors had been prepared to try the protesters in four sets, 
one of 66, the others of 41, 19 and 8. Those trials were due to begin Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, however, 68 of the protesters appeared before Thompson and 
agreed to waive their speedy trial right. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to 
try them in groups of five beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's hearing, Gregory Anthony, the activists' lead defense attorney, 
told Thompson he would ask the others facing charges to appear at this week's 
pretrial conference and seek a speedy trial waiver or grant him the authority 
to waive it for them. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Lehman, prosecutors believe the others either did appear Tuesday and 
waived their speedy trial right or gave Anthony waiver authority, Bishop said. 
Anthony did not return phone calls Tuesday to his Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Be Found 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the eight facing conspiracy charges "assumed active 
leadership roles" in the protests, according to a court order from the original 
consolidation of cases. 
</P>
<P>
In related action, 42 of the 107 activists facing less-serious infraction 
charges from the three protests have agreed to a plea bargain negotiated last 
Wednesday, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Those 42 pleaded no contest last Friday in exchange for the sentence 
prosecutors recommended, one day's community service, Bishop said. Court 
Commissioner James L. Duchnick ordered that the service be performed through 
the United Way, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that, as things move along, the others will take us up on the 
offer," Bishop said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN-AGER GUILTY IN MURDER OF BOY, 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Harbor City teen-ager has been found guilty of murder in the fatal drive-by 
shooting of a 16-year-old boy who was walking home from church in Wilmington 
last year. It was Hector Garcia's third murder conviction in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who turned 18 in May, will return to Long Beach Superior Court Sept. 1 
and could receive 27 years to life in prison for the murder of Rafael Pereda. 
He was shot to death March 22, 1988, moments after he left a youth meeting at 
Holy Family Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also faces 37 years to life in prison for a double murder in a drive-by 
shooting in August, 1988, in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully the judge will string the sentences together and he will get at 
least 64 years to life," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Carbaugh as the verdict 
was read last Friday. Carbaugh said he would have sought the death penalty if 
Garcia had been an adult when he committed the crimes.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer put his cruiser in the path of a runaway car Tuesday 
after its driver jumped out of the moving vehicle in an effort to evade police, 
officials said. The wayward car was headed toward a crowded schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Boyd Long let the driverless car ram his cruiser shortly after noon at 
24th and J streets, said San Diego Police Capt. Dick Toneck. The runaway car 
was headed toward the Sherman Elementary School playground half a block away, 
which was filled with children, Toneck said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old driver was arrested after a brief foot chase. The teen-ager, a 
student at Memorial Junior High School, was booked on suspicion of auto theft, 
Toneck said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 12:09 p.m. at 21st and K streets when the juvenile failed 
to yield to another police cruiser, according to Toneck. When the pursuit 
reached 24th and J, the boy jumped from the stolen car, Toneck said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA YSABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former tribal secretary and administrator of the Barona band of Mission 
Indians was arraigned Tuesday in federal court on a felony charge of embezzling 
about $10,000 in tribal funds over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Osuna, 43, of Santa Ysabel, was charged in U. S. District Court in San 
Diego as a result of a Department of Interior investigation into allegations 
that Osuna embezzled funds from tribal checking accounts during 1987 and 1988, 
said U. S. Atty. William Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna was tribal secretary of the Barona Indian band from July, 1985, to July, 
1988. The Barona reservation is about 7 miles northeast of Lakeside. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Barry Ted Moskowitz released Osuna on her own recognizance and 
ordered her to appear for further proceedings in District Court on Aug. 28.

L.A.'S SLUMS AND SLUMLORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've read with interest the recent series on slumlords in Los Angeles. Of 
particular interest was the July 31 article regarding Highland Federal Savings 
and Loan. The president of Highland Federal, Ben Karmelich, is quoted as 
saying, "We are an uncommon lender." Based on our limited experience with 
Highland Federal we can attest to this statement in a positive fashion. 
</P>
<P>
We have owned a single-family rental house for a number of years. The house is 
approaching 50 years in age and needed major renovations, including plumbing, 
new windows, re-stuccoing, etc. Despite the fact that there was sufficient 
equity and a sound credit rating none of the savings and loans we contacted, 
with the exception of Highland Federal, were willing to re-finance rental 
property to provide funds for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Federal did make the loan. The house was renovated extensively, we can 
now point to it with pride, and Highland Federal holds a loan with a very 
favorable equity ratio. In this instance by making an "uncommon loan" they have 
helped to prevent the development of slum-like conditions.

EL SALVADOR: THE WAR GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been much talk of peace in Central America following the summit 
meeting where the region's presidents agreed on a plan to end the Contra war in 
Nicaragua. While such talk is welcome, it must not obscure the fact that an 
even longer war, one perhaps more intractable, continues in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
October will mark the 10th anniversary of the military coup that sparked El 
Salvador's civil war, a conflict that has already claimed more than 50,000 
lives and displaced a quarter of the country's 5 million people. And the recent 
election of a hard-line rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, has exacerbated 
the political alienation that tore the country into warring factions. Since 
Cristiani's election, there has been an upsurge in assassinations, bombings and 
other acts of terrorism aimed at government officials and leaders of his Arena 
Party. Recently, Times correspondent Marjorie Miller reported that many 
conservative Salvadoran businessmen are reluctant to accept jobs in Cristiani's 
government, despite their ideological affinity for him and their financial 
support for Arena, because they fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more worrying aspects of Miller's report is the fact that 
investigations into the most widely publicized assassination -- the murder of 
Cristiani's presidential secretary, Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth -- have come 
up with very different factions that had reasons to kill him. They include 
urban commandos aligned with the leftist guerrillas fighting the Salvadoran 
government, right-wing death squads who distrusted the president's secretary 
for being a political pragmatist and supporters of an ambitious military 
officer who blamed Rodriguez for blocking their man's appointment to a top 
government job. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador has been a violent, dangerous place for the last decade, but the 
wide spectrum of possible suspects in the Rodriguez killing points up just how 
complex the political struggle there has become. And it explains why some 
analysts wonder aloud if El Salvador is not slipping towards a more chaotic, 
almost tribal, warfare. In their darkest scenarios, these analysts warn that El 
Salvador could become Central America's Lebanon if the crisis there is not 
resolved soon. For now such a parallel seems a bit strained -- but for how much 
longer?

AS OWLS GO, SO GOES THE FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compared with the foreign debt or tax reform, environmental issues generally 
seem simple. Wastes foul the ocean. Industrial emissions pollute the air. 
Chemicals deplete the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
But even environmental matters often are reduced to overly simplistic battle 
lines as one side or the other attempts to gain the emotional advantage of 
public support. A prime example is the fight over the cutting of old-growth 
national forests in the Pacific Northwest. From the timber industry's 
standpoint, the environmentalists want to bring a giant industry to its knees 
and throw innocent loggers out of work just to save a few reclusive owls. 
</P>
<P>
True, the fate of the northern spotted owl is the legal flash-point of the 
controversy over cutting the old-growth forests in Washington, Oregon and 
Northern California. Environmental groups have won court injunctions against 
further cutting on certain federal forest lands until experts can determine the 
nature of the threat to the owl, which is protected under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue is far broader and deeper than owls versus jobs or owls against 
people. The viability of the owl is a symptom of the health of the whole 
forest. If the owl is disappearing, then something basic is wrong with the 
forest. If the forest is so severely threatened, then the public must decide 
whether something should be done to save it. 
</P>
<P>
The law is supposed to do that now. That is the process established in a 
variety of federal statutes passed in the past two decades. But legislators in 
the Northwest are seeking to circumvent this process by voiding the court 
injunctions and precluding any further legal action on the proposed cutting of 
10 million board feet of old-growth forests through the coming fiscal year. 
Such a provision was inserted by the Senate into the Interior appropriations 
bill that now awaits negotiations in a Senate-House conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental law was written to provide long-term protection of the nation's 
natural resources, not to expedite their economic exploitation for short-term 
profits. That law should not be voided or short-circuited now.

SALES TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her letter (July 27) (regarding mail-order loophole), Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore states, "Local retailers and national firms with stores in California 
already make a substantial contribution to the state's revenues." Maybe someone 
should explain to Ms. Moore how the state sales tax works. The "local retailers 
and national firms" are not making "the substantial contribution"; the 
taxpayers are making that contribution. 
</P>
<P>
It is heartwarming to know, however, she feels that by having us pay this 
additional tax she has "acted to secure our taxpayers' interests." As the 
saying goes, with friends like this, who needs enemies?

DRUG REGULATION BALANCES OVER FLIMSIER SAFETY NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KINSLEY, Michael Kinsley is the editor of the New Republic and 
writes its TRB column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1960s, popular magazines were full of complaints about the 
regulation of prescription drugs. Saturday Review demanded that "a 
disinterested agency" take charge of judging "the 'cures' that flood the 
market." Harper's warned of inadequate clinical testing, attacked lax standards 
and corruption at the Food and Drug Administration and expressed the hope that 
tighter regulation "may lead to a substantial reduction in the number of new 
preparations marketed every year." 
</P>
<P>
This month's Reader's Digest also has an article complaining about the 
regulation of prescription drugs. It's headlined "Why Can't We Get the Medicine 
We Need?" Excessive bureaucracy and caution -- even corruption -- at the FDA 
are keeping vital drugs off the market, the author charges. She demands that 
Congress "repeal the agency's authority to review drug efficacy" because "the 
relative merits of drugs . . . are . . . personal decisions." 
</P>
<P>
There's just no pleasing some people. Widespread sentiments like the ones 
quoted above, plus the Thalidomide scandal, led in 1962 to a law requiring the 
FDA to certify that new drugs are effective as well as merely safe. Now, led by 
AIDS activists, popular sentiment is swinging back the other way. And the FDA 
has responded by drastically short-circuiting its approval process for some 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
America's elephantine drug-approval policy is an example of our society's 
immature attitude toward risk. Life is inherently risky; reducing one risk 
often increases others, yet at any given time we tend to focus on only one side 
of the equation. In order to reduce to absolute zero the risk of a Thalidomide 
catastrophe, we have created a system that denies sick people helpful 
medicines. 
</P>
<P>
This happens in three ways. First, people suffer and die needlessly while 
medicines go through the FDA process (which until recently took an average of 
eight years). Second, medicines that could meet FDA standards never get the 
chance because the process is too costly (typically $100 million). Third, the 
government's standards are simply too high. Once a drug is established as safe, 
why should it also have to be proven effective before people can get it? In the 
case of fatal diseases, why must a drug even be proven perfectly safe? 
</P>
<P>
Washington VIPs, when struck with some serious disease, often seem to surface 
in experimental programs at the National Institutes of Health. Sometimes they 
undergo miraculous recoveries. More often, probably, they die anyway. But that 
doesn't stop others from trying to get in. And why not? Under the 
circumstances, clutching at straws makes perfect sense. Still, if the rules 
that keep these experimental drugs off the market are for our own good, why is 
it that political big shots are getting them at the NIH rather than, say, 
prisoners or real estate agents? 
</P>
<P>
And yet these days the above complaints are old hat. At least in the case of 
AIDS drugs, virtually anybody can get into an experimental treatment program. 
There is something called "treatment IND," which means a vastly expanded 
official testing program. And both the FDA and the NIH have endorsed the 
concept of a "parallel track" of "community-based" testing, which is little 
more than letting doctors give the drug to their patients in the ordinary 
course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the FDA is managing to get risky drugs to desperate patients without 
having to admit that it is lowering its standards. Obviously, however, an 
elaborate testing program becomes largely superfluous if every potential 
customer gets to participate in the test. 
</P>
<P>
By evading its own excessive standards instead of simply lowering them (or 
asking Congress to lower them), the FDA is helping us all to keep avoiding a 
sensible decision about the risk-benefit trade-off. It is still too hard to get 
a new medicine with a normal prescription, but it may be getting too easy to 
get one as part of an "experiment." Some day there will be another Thalidomide, 
and the public, which is now clamoring for increased access to new drugs, will 
clamor with equal passion for increased protection from them. I would not want 
to be the FDA commissioner forced to explain that the thousands of victims were 
simply voluntary participants in a testing program. 
</P>
<P>
By all means, let's amend the law to get rid of the efficacy requirement. But 
understand that this means billions of dollars will be wasted on useless 
remedies, and that some people will be enticed to forgo better alternatives. 
Let's even relax our standards of safety a bit, so drugs can get to market 
quicker and cheaper. But understand that a flimsier safety net means that more 
dangerous drugs will fall through it. Above all, let's stop going from one 
extreme to the other.

ALL MEXICO NEEDS NOW IS GOOD-FAITH INVESTORS; 
</P>
<P>
DEBT DEAL ALREADY SHOWS A RIPPLE EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WAYNE CORNELIUS and WILSON PERES, Wayne Cornelius is director of the Center 
for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. Wilson Peres is visiting professor of 
economics in the Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies 
at UC San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico's recently concluded agreement with its commercial bank creditors is no 
panacea for the country's economic problems, and President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari may have oversold it for domestic political gain. But in focusing on 
the large discrepancy between the Mexicans' initial negotiating position and 
the final outcome, critics have underestimated the deal's significant economic 
payoffs for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The most important short-term consequence of the agreement has been a sharp 
drop in the interest rate paid by the Mexican government on its internal debt, 
from 56% in June to 34% at present. With the resulting savings, equivalent to 
4% of total gross domestic product, Salinas should be able to hold the 
public-sector deficit to 8% of GDP in 1989, and to reduce it to 4% next year, 
without another round of socially painful and politically debilitating 
austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
Public-deficit reduction on that scale will diminish the danger of a new 
inflationary spiral as Mexico's economy begins to grow again. We can expect 
inflation -- now running at 17% per year -- to continue dropping as the 
government deficit is pared. Moreover, to the extent that high real interest 
rates have deterred productive investment by Mexico's private sector in recent 
years, this impediment to economic recovery should also be removed. 
</P>
<P>
There is still considerable uncertainty about how much interest-payment relief 
and new money will ultimately result from the deal. However, under plausible 
assumptions about which of the three options offered under the agreement will 
be chosen by each of Mexico's 500 creditor banks, Mexico's net transfer of 
resources abroad will be reduced by $1.5 billion per year. This amount is equal 
to an oil-price increase of more than $3 per barrel, or more than half of 
Mexico's net annual earnings from tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Should Mexico have held out for a better deal from its commercial bank 
creditors, and what could have been done to achieve it? It is now known that in 
the last stage of the negotiations the Salinas government went to the brink 
with the banks, setting a two-day limit for concluding an agreement and 
threatening to take "other courses of action" if that deadline were not met. 
Salinas' well-known propensity to take large risks in pursuit of his key 
objectives undoubtedly lent credibility to the threat of a suspension or 
unilateral reduction of external debt service. 
</P>
<P>
It is by no means clear that, in the absence of much stronger pressure on the 
banks than the Bush Administration apparently was willing to apply, Mexico 
could have achieved much more from this extremely difficult and protracted 
negotiation. By contrast, it is certain that Mexico's incipient economic 
reactivation of 1989 and the stronger hoped-for recovery of 1990 would have 
been jeopardized by failure to reach an agreement with the banks in the second 
half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The internal political clock was also running strongly against further delay. 
The July, 1991, mid-term elections will be another watershed in Mexico's 
transition to a more competitive political system. The ruling party's control 
of the federal legislature will be at stake, as will Salinas' project to reform 
and modernize the party. The government is also finding it increasingly 
difficult to maintain labor peace after more than eight years of declining real 
wages. A necessary -- though by no means sufficient -- condition of success on 
all of these fronts is a growing economy with price stability, and the 
foundation for such an economic recovery must be laid this year. 
</P>
<P>
Much now depends on the behavior of Mexico's private sector. Those businessmen 
who have long complained about the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the 
economy due to the lack of a debt deal no longer have that pretext for 
withholding new investments. Salinas' debt deal, combined with new tax 
regulations that encourage the return of flight capital, has put the ball back 
into their court. 
</P>
<P>
The Salinas administration is counting heavily on the psychological multiplier 
effect of getting an agreement to compensate for the lack of more substantial 
debt relief. There had been widespread skepticism that Salinas would be able to 
wrest significant concessions from the foreign bankers. Many Mexicans holding 
flight capital in U.S. accounts and big corporate investors in Mexico and 
abroad will remain skeptical, until they are convinced by the final numbers and 
by a clear and consistent turnaround in macroeconomic indicators. Already, 
however, some confidence seems to have been restored. More than $800 million in 
flight capital has returned to Mexico, either since the debt agreement was 
struck or in the days immediately preceding it, and new investments by 
transnational corporations totaling more than $1.8 billion have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign bankers' none-too-generous treatment of their "model debtor" 
country has done little to inspire confidence in the applicability elsewhere of 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan for defusing the Latin American 
debt crisis. But within Mexico, the modest relief that the banks reluctantly 
granted can serve as the catalyst for repairing the immense damage that seven 
years of debt-induced recession and government austerity have wrought.

RETHINKING THE SCHOOL CHOICE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA P. HUGHES, Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles) is the chairwoman of the 
state Assembly Education Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The demand for accountability and quality schools has become linked to the 
issue of school choice. The idea that parents have the right to send their 
children to any public school has undeniable appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Certain types of school-choice plans are in place in many states. California 
already has a large number of open-enrollment plans available, such as 
interdistrict transfer agreements, magnet schools, educational clinics, 
specialized secondary school programs and alternative school programs. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the debate over choice has assumed highly ideological and 
polarized viewpoints: Proponents see it as the salvation of the public schools; 
opponents view it as not only a Pandora's Box for schools but a clever way 
around state and federal desegregation laws. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the value of open enrollment is somewhere in the middle: Choice 
alone will not improve our schools. But it can be a significant complement to 
other educational reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
East Harlem has what is considered one of the best public school choice 
programs in the nation; that school system made dramatic improvements by 
allowing teachers to create distinctive schools. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing success of East Harlem, however, can't be attributed solely to open 
enrollment. The system also includes school-based management that provides each 
school with autonomy. This independence creates a learning environment that 
limits class size to 18 pupils and promotes staff development, supplemental 
funding and alternative schools. 
</P>
<P>
Parental choice in schools does have some advantages: Schools compete for 
students and thus have an added incentive to improve. Open enrollment allows 
parents to match a school's educational programs to the specific needs of their 
child. A choice plan also may allow a parent to move his or her child from a 
school with a poor scholastic record to one with a good academic program 
without the usual time-consuming bureaucratic paperwork. And the option of 
choosing a school often enhances parental involvement in the education process. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some serious questions regarding choice that are either 
overlooked or brushed aside by proponents. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argue that a free society is based upon the ability to make choices 
and that choice should be extended to the public schools. Yet a true 
free-market system has control over its resources and can modify 
inefficiencies. Schools do not have complete control over resources, funding 
and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while open enrollment will make some schools more competitive, it 
will make improvement more difficult for schools with low-achieving students. 
How many schools will be able to improve if the number of students and the 
amount of funding declines? Will parents or the state assume responsibility for 
providing low-income children adequate transportation to and from school? And 
will state funds for instruction be taken away to provide transportation? 
</P>
<P>
If transportation is not adequately worked out, there is an increased risk of 
re-segregating our public schools. The Los Angeles Unified School District 
spends more than $1,000 per student each year for transportation within the 
district. Yet if transportation were not provided, the benefits of open 
enrollment would fall mainly to those parents who are able to drive their 
children to school. The hard-fought educational desegregation battles of the 
1950s and 1960s could slowly be eroded under the guise of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood schools, long the bastion of the American educational network, 
could lose their focus if they ceased to be a community concern. Parents would 
not necessarily vote for the school board members representing areas where 
their children are enrolled, and this could decrease accountability. 
</P>
<P>
Another serious question concerning open enrollment is about the selection 
process of students. If there are more applicants than space in a school, what 
process would the school use to make a selection? Would the decision to admit a 
student be based on who is the most vocal or influential parent or who is the 
most gifted child? 
</P>
<P>
The success of any open enrollment plan depends on providing parents with 
complete and accurate information that explains the options available to them. 
Therefore, parental information programs and in-service training are necessary. 
Given the many languages spoken in California, this will prove costly. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a free-market system depends on the ability to advertise its products. 
In today's strained fiscal environment, is it wise to dip into the limited pool 
of education dollars for promotional purposes? Who would control the 
advertising to ensure accurate program representation? 
</P>
<P>
Open-enrollment options have merit, but they need to be further studied and 
clarified before they are implemented on a grand scale. If the objective is to 
improve public school offerings for both parents and students, then elements of 
choice may be a logical and positive extension of educational reforms. But if 
the effect is to destroy the chance of a good education for all students in all 
types of neighborhoods, then open enrollment will become the divisive education 
issue of the next decade.

AS A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD, MICKEY LELAND'S MISSION WAS HUMANITY, NOT IDEOLOGY 
</P>

President.

Mickey Leland always flew into the storm. 
</P>
<P>
I remember being in Houston with Mickey in October, 1986, where he had invited 
me to come to work with him on a crusade for moral and educational excellence 
in the Houston schools. We were meeting late, when the phone rang at 2 in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was a woman in Mississippi who told us that an old and distinguished African 
American college, Mississippi Valley State College, was about to be turned into 
a state prison. Could I come to Mississippi in the morning to help reverse this 
decision? 
</P>
<P>
There were terrible storms in the South and the airport had put commercial 
flights on hold indefinitely. So I called the woman back and said "We can't get 
there. No plane will leave." 
</P>
<P>
But Mickey stayed up that night and kept looking, and not only did he find a 
private pilot who would fly us there, he went with me to Mississippi before 
dawn. When we arrived, the plane was battered and damaged from the storm. 
</P>
<P>
That was the way Mickey was: flying from Texas to Mississippi in the middle of 
the night in stormy weather to help save from the ultimate insult a 
African-American college that some people loved. 
</P>
<P>
In his dazzling career as a political leader, Mickey Leland was always flying 
into the eye of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
After he was elected to the Texas Legislature in 1972 at the young age of 28, 
Mickey made a trip to Africa. He was planning on spending three weeks in 
Tanzania but became so compelled by his anti-hunger and anti-poverty work there 
that he stayed three months. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey never lost his passion for the people of Africa. When he was able to 
establish, over the opposition of those in Congress who said it was a waste of 
money, the House Select Committee on World Hunger, he became its chairman. And 
many, many people in Africa lived because of his leadership. In 1985, the year 
after the creation of his committee, the United States sent $800 million in aid 
to famine-stricken Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned from a trip to the Sudan in April, Mickey responded eloquently 
to criticism that he should be spending all of his time on problems in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I am as much a citizen of this world as I am of my country. To hell with those 
people who are critical of what I am able to do to help save peoples' lives. I 
don't mean to sound hokey but I grew up on a Christian ethic, which says we are 
supposed to help our brothers." 
</P>
<P>
For Mickey, hunger was not just another political issue. For him, who eats and 
who dies was the central moral question of our time. Mickey said he lived every 
day with the image of a young girl who died of the effects of starvation before 
his eyes in Sudan in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey was not your average politician. His only ideological commitment was to 
humanity itself. He often took courageous stands that were not politically 
expedient. 
</P>
<P>
As a Texas congressman, he opposed all aid to the Contras, who he saw as 
murderers, rapists and bandits. 
</P>
<P>
He often visited Cuban President Fidel Castro, and had negotiated the release 
of three Cuban political prisoners and their families. Mickey saw that it was 
hypocritical for the United States to have full diplomatic relations with the 
vicious apartheid state of South Africa but to refuse relations with Cuba, a 
tiny island 90 miles away from us. 
</P>
<P>
A passionate lover of humanity, Mickey built bridges between communities of 
long-lost friends. Fluent in Spanish, Mickey understood the importance of 
bilingual education for Mexican Americans struggling to make their place in 
America. He brought African Americans and Latinos together. 
</P>
<P>
He founded a program to send poor African American teen-agers to Israel during 
the summer to learn about Jewish heritage, and he once bicycled through Israel. 
One of the people who died with Mickey was Ivan Tillem, a distinguished 
anti-hunger and human-rights activist in his own right, and editor and 
publisher of the Jewish Directory and Almanac. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey often quoted the Talmud, saying, "If you save one life, you save the 
whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey died, as he lived, flying into the eye of a storm to fight hunger and 
despair, to save one life and life of the whole world, with African Americans 
and whites, Christians and Jews at his side as his traveling companions and 
comrades. 
</P>
<P>
During this painful time, I take comfort in a passage from Corinthians: "We are 
troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in 
dispair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
This Earth is a far richer place because of Mickey Leland and a far poorer 
place without him. We can do his memory no greater honor than to recommit 
ourselves to taking care of the hungry and homeless part of humanity that 
Mickey loved with all his heart and was serving at the time of his shocking and 
tragic death.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THE DOORMAN ADVISED PASSING FOURSOMES THAT THE MAIN HALLWAY 
BROKE LEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A charity golf tournament was held inside the Woodland Hills Marriott the other 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Some celebrities and some plain folks got together for a bellman's version of 
miniature golf. Everyone was handed a putter and a ball, and they set off to 
putt-putt through 18 very short holes in the hotel's lobby, hallways and larger 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
Sand was sprinkled on the floor to form "traps" and potted plants acted as 
"trees." The doorman advised passing foursomes that the main hallway broke 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Cute idea. And money was raised for a good cause. But it seems these people 
missed a rare opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
See, the Marriott is a reasonably nice hotel. Expensively decorated with 
ornamental vases and potted plants. Extensive use of glass. 
</P>
<P>
Tremendous potential for damage. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing quickens the pulse like an outburst of senseless demolition, so why not 
give everyone a full bag of clubs and let'em tee off? Imagine all the crashing 
and bashing about -- that kind of action is a no-miss for network news. ESPN 
could supply color commentary. A historic event. 
</P>
<P>
It could have started slowly, tension building. The first few holes 
crisscrossed a restaurant, so you could have ruined a few place settings and 
maybe somebody's appetite. Merely a warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
Holes six and seven ran through the hotel's nightclub. Row upon row of 
expensive liquor bottles. Floor-to-ceiling mirrors. The possibilities would 
have been endless. 
</P>
<P>
Hole 11, a nifty par three, was situated in the concierge's VIP lounge. Here, 
experienced golfers could have faced a difficult chip shot to take out the 
chandelier. Ah, the spirit of challenge. Beginners could have opted for a 
simpler, straight drive through the picture window that lay just beyond the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
Onward to the 12th tee -- the presidential suite generously furnished with 
Oriental artwork, glass table-tops and wonderfully delicate-looking lamps. Talk 
about a target-rich environment. Be sure to wear safety goggles. 
</P>
<P>
Given half an hour and a decent selection of irons, my grandmother could have 
made a shambles of this room . . . and she has a pitiful short game. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, several fairways cut across heavily populated areas. One tee in 
the lobby afforded a clear lie to the front desk, where unwitting tourists 
waited to check in. Another hole, bordering the pool, could have offered 
novices an easier shot at slow-moving targets. 
</P>
<P>
Envision innocent bystanders scrambling for cover. Not since the golden era of 
Gerald Ford has golf enjoyed such excitement. The game needs a shot in the arm. 
A little adrenaline, a threat of physical injury to compete with spectator 
sports like, say, Australian rules football. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, none of this came to pass: A putter simply can't generate the power, lift 
and distance required for widespread breakage. 
</P>
<P>
So contestants putted peacefully. Well, relatively peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"They're arguing and shouting," said David Smith, a former professional golfer 
brought in to supervise. "They seem to be having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Players were divided into teams, suited businessmen paired with television 
actors. The new Gidget was there and one of the old CHIPS guys and some soap 
opera actors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stars were so well-known that they had to introduce themselves at 
length. "I'm an unknown, quasi-pseudo-semi-celebrity," said Stephen Mendel, who 
said he acts in a show called "Night Heat" that he said airs each Tuesday at 1 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Several Hollywood agents were on hand too. They scurried about the periphery, 
trying to get their clients noticed. One woman, who represented a teen-age 
actor on a Fox Network sitcom, asked a television news crew from the same 
network to film her young star at play. She was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a hockey player turned out to be one of the best golfers. But every 
once in a while, he'd glance uneasily at the other players, as if antsy to lay 
a hip check on someone, anyone. 
</P>
<P>
In a perfect world, a vicious maneuver like this would have fit perfectly with 
the Destruct-O-Golf theme. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Steve Duchesne, who plays defense for the Los Angeles Kings. "In the 
summer I'm kind of quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Another wasted opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't even find a violently bad dresser in the crowd. Several people 
wore plaid, but there wasn't a single pair of Sansabelt slacks to be seen. One 
woman had the audacity to show up wearing Batman earrings. Think she'd get two 
steps inside a stuffy club like Augusta? 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the crowd and the setting, this tournament did have some 
similarity to real golf. 
</P>
<P>
People cheated. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of cheating," said one tournament organizer. "Terrible cheating." 
</P>
<P>
People drank a lot too. Every third hole passed by a bar. Now this feature 
should be incorporated into regulation golf. Want to see a pro like Greg Norman 
really lose it in sudden death? Feed him a half-dozen margaritas on the back 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the 70 or so businessmen and actors seemed to have fun, and they raised 
$5,000 for the Celebrity Outreach Foundation, which gives money to groups like 
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Planned Parenthood and the Greater Los Angeles 
Partnership for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no pottery was shattered. No wood splintered or mirrors cracked. No 
broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
Just think, this could have been something special.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRASH OF PRIVATE PLANE NORTH OF CASTAIC KILLS 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private plane crashed into a steep mountainside about 6 miles north of 
Castaic on Tuesday, killing a passenger and critically injuring the 22-year-old 
pilot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a two-seat Cessna that had been missing since 9 a.m., was owned by 
Southland Aviation, based at Whiteman Airport in Pacoima, said Los Angeles 
County Fire Department Inspector Joe Silva. The victims were a student pilot 
and an instructor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the dead instructor was not released until relatives could be 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Andrew Conejo of Los Angeles, suffered head injuries, facial cuts 
and a broken left arm, said Rose Morelli, nursing supervisor at Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo was later transferred to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, 
where he was in stable condition and able to speak, said Holly Lyons, a 
hospital nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not known. Investigators from the National 
Transportation Safety Board briefly surveyed the crash site from a helicopter 
Tuesday and were scheduled to return for further inspection this morning, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed in rugged territory just north of Templin Highway, about four 
miles east of the Golden State Freeway in the Angeles National Forest. 
Firefighters had to be flown in by helicopter and cut through 10-foot-high 
brush to reach the plane, said Bob Dunbar, who piloted the helicopter for the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The exact time of the crash was not known, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Axelrod, an electrical power plant engineer at a Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power pumping storage facility just east of the crash site, said 
another plant employee noticed the downed plane as the men were riding home in 
a company van at about 3:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at the hills, saw a plane sitting there and said, 'That wasn't there 
yesterday,' " Axelrod said. The man called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The plane appeared to have crashed into the mountainside from the east, Dunbar 
said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI ASKS FOR COST STUDY ON DISPOSAL COSTS AT 
DUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the people of Los Angeles have been misled into believing that Lopez 
Canyon Landfill offers the only solution to the city's trash crisis, Los 
Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi called Tuesday for an in-depth study of 
disposal costs at past, current and future dumps. 
</P>
<P>
"Lopez Canyon Landfill is not the only option available to the city in its 
development of an adequate solid waste disposal program, and should be 
considered only as one of many dominoes," Bernardi said in a motion calling for 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
The motion was referred by the Council to the newly formed Environmental 
Quality and Waste Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said the study should compare costs of closing Lopez Canyon Landfill 
-- which now accepts three-fourths of the city's residential trash -- to costs 
associated with not using other canyons purchased for landfills, such as 
Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. He said 
costs of opening a proposed new dump in Elsmere Canyon also should be 
evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
The city Bureau of Sanitation has estimated that it would have to spend at 
least $26 million a year in dumping fees to divert trash from Lopez Canyon to 
other public and private landfills. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, Bernardi agreed to postpone for a week a motion he and 
Councilman Joel Wachs had initiated that would extend by 60 days the review 
period for expansion of Lopez Canyon Landfill. City Atty. James Hahn said his 
staff needs more time to investigate the legality of altering the standard 
environmental review process, which is scheduled to end with a council hearing 
later this month.

COMPROMISES BRING SYLMAR PROJECT CLOSER TO REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A giant industrial park proposed for a Sylmar hillside moved a step closer to 
reality Tuesday when a city committee and the developer agreed on several 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee deferred action on the most serious debate -- whether 
developer and landowner John Symonds should be allowed to sandwich offices and 
manufacturing buildings on land between two earthquake faults. 
</P>
<P>
The 262-acre project would be on rural land north of Foothill Boulevard and 
east of the Golden State Freeway. It would include 33 houses, a park and a 
child-care center in addition to up to 2 million square feet of industrial 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Friedman, a city planner, told members of the Planning and Land Use 
Management Committee that it is unwise to allow building between fault zones 
"if it can be reasonably avoided." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission decided in September, 1988, to bar development on that 
land, which encompasses about one-third of the project and lies along the 
northern edge, near the Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seismic Experts 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the committee, said 
seismic experts should be asked to testify before the City Council rules on 
development in the fault zone. Rather than hold the entire appeal in committee, 
Bernson said it would be sent to the City Council with no recommendation on 
that issue. 
</P>
<P>
The committee sided with the developer in his appeal of the Planning 
Commission's limit on building height to 45 feet -- three stories. Mark 
Armbruster, speaking for Symonds, said that in some parts of the project, 
industrial buildings could reach as high as six stories, about 75 feet, without 
intruding on neighbors' views. 
</P>
<P>
"Those areas would be the areas farthest away from homes and least visible," 
Armbruster said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who, with Bernson, represents people living nearest 
to the proposed development, agreed to the higher heights "as long as there's 
open space around them, not wall to wall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Representatives 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of various Sylmar homeowner and civic groups attended the 
meeting and supported the compromises. Most had opposed the development when it 
was first proposed more than three years ago, but in the interim they have 
worked with the developer and city officials to make the project more 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
During those negotiations and through the city review process, Symonds has 
agreed to preserve large expanses of open land, include access for horse 
riders, use wrought-iron fences instead of chain-link and finance several road 
improvements to reduce the effect of truck and commuter traffic caused by the 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi applauded Symonds' approach, saying, "The cooperation with the 
developer has been excellent."

GOLF / BRIAN MURPHY;

<P>
LOCALS TO PUT TALENTS ON STAGE IN AMATEUR HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan and Craig Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Craig Steinberg? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't sound right, does it? Try this, then: Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan and Bob 
Burns. 
</P>
<P>
No. Still doesn't sound right. Let's face it. The names Steinberg, Burns, Rich 
Greenwood, Phil Hurlbut, Charlie Wi and Mitch Voges will never be mistaken for 
the golfing legends mentioned above. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, starting next Tuesday, these six Valley-area golfers (Simi Valley's 
Voges and Thousand Oaks' Wi are alternates) will tread the hallowed fairways of 
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pa., as they compete in the prestigious U. S. 
Amateur Open -- the same fairways that have played host to some of American 
golf's great moments. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: Jones won his first U. S. Amateur at Merion in 1922 and Hogan made his 
dramatic comeback from a near-fatal car accident to win the 1950 U. S. Open at 
Merion. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, one would think, for a 23-year-old UCLA graduate such as Encino's 
Greenwood, who will be playing in his first U. S. Amateur, the thought of 
playing historic Merion must surely leave him quaking in his golf spikes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not really. 
</P>
<P>
"A course is just a course, really," Greenwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to those words would surely make the golfing greats of yore spin like 
lathes in their graves. But before we dismiss Greenwood as a disrespectful 
youth, keep listening. 
</P>
<P>
"But it'll be great to play on a course with such a history," said Greenwood, 
who plans to turn pro immediately after the Amateur. "Every time I'm driving in 
my car I think about winning it there. I'm kind of on a semi-high about the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Many a golf legend can count a U. S. Amateur titles in his resume. 
Jack Nicklaus won the thing twice, in 1959 and 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Being even mentioned in the same breath along with such legendary names is one 
reason why playing in the Amateur is still a bit of fantasy for a young golfer 
such as Granada Hills' Burns, a 21-year-old Mission College student who, like 
Greenwood, will be playing in his first Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hasn't hit me yet," said Burns, the 1987 junior college state 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Burns qualified last Monday at Palos Verdes Golf Club by firing a 143 over 36 
holes to tie for second with Greenwood. Hurlbut, from Sherman Oaks, shot a 145 
to just make the cut. Of 114 golfers at Palos Verdes, only the top seven could 
qualify, which places the trio in fairly lofty standing among California 
amateurs. But Burns hasn't lost his perspective of youthful exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'll make a little vacation out of the whole thing," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side of these fuzzy-cheeked newcomers is Steinberg, the 31-year-old 
Van Nuys resident who qualified last Monday with a 137 over 36 holes at San 
Luis Obispo Country Club to place first in a field of 45. Unlike Burns or 
Greenwood, the feeling of qualifying for the Amateur is an old one for 
Steinberg: He will be making his sixth trip to the Amateur in the past eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think that makes him a callous veteran. In fact, Steinberg is almost 
as pumped as Greenwood or Burns. 
</P>
<P>
"The excitement never gets old," said Steinberg, who played on USC's 1980 NCAA 
championship team. "It's the best tournament an amateur can play. The most 
important, certainly." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, an optometrist with a practice in Westlake Village, reached the 
round of 32 in 1982 for his best finish. This year, however, he says that he 
would like to finish in the top eight or four. The U. S. Amateur is a 
match-play event. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his finish, however, Steinberg isn't looking to make a career out 
the event. When the Amateur is over, Steinberg will shove his putter back in 
the bag and head back to the land of retinas and corneas. At least until the 
next major amateur event rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a 21-year old college senior who's about to turn pro," Steinberg said. 
"So if I win, great. If not, I'll try again. For a 21-year old, it means a lot 
more. I probably have more fun." 
</P>
<P>
On the storied greens of Merion, though, one can be sure that a lot of amateurs 
will be having fun next week. 
</P>
<P>
Straight down the middle: Birdies, schmirdies. Sometimes it pays to play a 
little boring golf. Just ask Matt Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, 18, a Simi Valley High graduate, won the Desert Golf Assn.'s Junior 
Invitational one-day tournament at Palm Valley Country Club in Palm Springs 
last week with exactly zero birdies. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. Williamson shot a three-over 75 with some consistent play and, 
yawn, a lot of pars. But it's not as if that was the way he liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't find a birdie," Williamson said. "But I'd seen some scores from the 
other golfers and I figured if they shot that poorly I'd beat them if 75 was 
all it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson's round edged Clark Heavner's 76 and Robert Castro's 77 in the 
seniors group for 18-year-old players. He won a "nice, big trophy" for his 
efforts. But, as Williamson says, the efforts he put forth were not on the 
spectacular side as far as mashing the ball off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hit a lot of irons off the tees," said Williamson, who was Simi Valley 
High's No. 1 player as a senior. "I used my driver on two holes and just left 
it in the bag the rest of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Surely, though, Williamson must have had a big finish on 18 for a dramatic win, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said, "I just reached the green and two-putted it." So much for drama. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson is currently pondering an opportunity to play golf for Cal Lutheran 
in the fall. In the meantime, though, he can serve as inspiration for all those 
golfers out there for whom the elusive birdie consistently lies a frustrating 
shot away. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared: Philanthropic golfers, take note. The 10th Boy Scout Golf 
tournament is set for Monday, Sept. 11 at Pasadena's Brookside Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is open to men and women with a registration fee of $150. In 
addition to a bevy of door prizes, a 1989 Thunderbird will be presented to 
anyone who records a hole-in-one on the 191-yard eighth hole. 
</P>
<P>
Cash prizes also will be handed out in three categories: low net, low gross and 
calloway. The event is co-sponsored by the West Glendale and Burbank Kiwanis 
clubs to benefit the Verdugo Hills Council, Boy Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Mark Rapko of Oxnard last week narrowly missed lowering the 
course record at Simi Hills Public Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Rapko, 23, fired a 63, but Simi Hills starter Ted Schumacher believes that 
Rapko's red-hot score only tied him with two other, Paul Hoppe and Bobby Garza. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here six years and I'm sure they're the only three who have shot 
that low," Schumacher said.

The Chargers had what may have been the worst practice of training camp Tuesday 
morning. And they heard about it immediately afterward from Coach Dan Henning, 
who raised his voice for one of the first times this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sloppy practice," he told reporters afterward. "I don't think they 
were into it. I didn't think their minds were in it. We had some mental 
lapses." 
</P>
<P>
Henning was mainly upset with the offense, which managed just three points in 
the exhibition opener Sunday, a 20-3 loss to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense played well (in practice)," Henning said. "I hope they're that 
good. But offensively we've got to catch up to them." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't figure to get any easier Saturday night in Chicago, where the 
Chargers play the Bears, the best defense in the NFL over the past five years. 
Four days later, they face the defending NFL champion 49ers in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense always has to set the tone," Henning said. "But they lost it a 
little bit out here. You can't allow that to happen. They can't allow that to 
happen. They've got to push through the tough stuff so that they'll have it 
when you need it." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he knows how he will distribute the playing time to his 
quarterbacks against the Bears, but he wouldn't announce it Tuesday. And he 
wouldn't say when he would announce it, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you when I'm ready to tell you," he said. "And it will be after I 
tell them (the quarterbacks). That hasn't taken place at all." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end/linebacker Leslie O'Neal "got a little tired" in Sunday's loss to 
the Cowboys, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal missed all of the 1987 season and much of last year because of the knee 
injury he sustained late in 1986. He still practices part-time and may never be 
the player he was before the injury. But his new designation as the "LIZ" man 
this year enables him to rush the passer from a three-point stance or a 
stand-up position. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie is in the position that, I think, is the most difficult in professional 
football, endurance-wise," Henning said. "And that's a pass rusher -- a guy 
that has to be in there down after down. And they've got to condition 
themselves every down -- first to think about rushing the passer and then to 
play the run. And that takes a great deal of stamina and endurance, a great 
deal. Even a wide receiver doesn't have to have that kind of stamina." 
</P>
<P>
With many of the Chargers nursing injuries, and the team headed for two road 
games in four days, Henning already has begun tapering down practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Keoki would choke me if I didn't," Henning said, referring to trainer Keoki 
Kamau. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also will give the Chargers days off following the Bears and 49ers 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"That only makes logical sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday and Tuesday after the game against the Bears, the Chargers will only 
practice once each day. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will practice at UC San Diego Friday morning before boarding a 
plane that is scheduled to land in Chicago at 10 p.m. They play the Bears 
Saturday at 4 p.m. PDT. Ch. 10 will broadcast the game live. The announcers 
will be former Charger quarterback Dan Fouts and his father, Bob Fouts. . . . 
Starting free safety Vencie Glenn has a bruised calf. Backup cornerback Elvis 
Patterson re-pulled a muscle in his leg during the morning practice. Rookie 
center Courtney Hall, who has been nursing an ankle injury most of the month, 
re-injured it.

DAVE DISTEL: LUGINBILL HOPES THESE AZTECS GO DOWN IN THE TRADITION BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Luginbill is a professorial man with a sense of history, some of which he 
would like to see repeated and some of which he would like to see go away. 
</P>
<P>
If you understand that the man is the head football coach at San Diego State 
University, then you also understand where he is coming from. We are not 
talking the kind of history that stirs academicians to doctoral treatises, but 
rather the history can either stir a community or put it to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Of late, SDSU football has been a cure for insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill knows it has not always been this way and does not have to stay the 
way it has been. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill is the man who steps into a position packed with a most unique type 
of pressure. It comes more from within the athletic department than from the 
community at-large, which does not seem to have the frenzied level of interest 
it takes to hang an unsuccessful coach in effigy. His task is to heighten that 
interest level and, thus, bail out an athletic department that must have an 
artistically and financially successful football program to survive at a major 
college level. 
</P>
<P>
No easy chore, Al. 
</P>
<P>
That's where history comes into play. History is one word, but Luginbill 
prefers another. He prefers tradition. 
</P>
<P>
You see, history is all-encompassing. History covers the good and the bad. 
Tradition is a fond memory of the good. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk a lot about tradition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition, selective that it is, runs its course through the 1960s and 1970s at 
SDSU, those wonderful days when Don Coryell and Claude Gilbert, Coryell's 
protege, captured the community's heart and soul. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at universities who've gone two decades with very, very little change, 
and you'll see universities with very good programs," Luginbill said. "San 
Diego State's athletic administration and football program have undergone more 
changes in the last decade than in the previous two decades combined. Look at 
the programs that have been most successful here -- women's volleyball, tennis, 
men's soccer and baseball, for example -- and you'll see programs with 
long-time coaches. We need a long-time football coach and athletic director to 
breed the consistency we need, and consistency breeds winning." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill is right about turnover. Since Coryell and Gilbert coached from 1961 
through 1980, SDSU has had three football coaches. Fred Miller took over in 
1985 as the fifth athletic director since SDSU joined the Western Athletic 
Conference in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
There is not room here to detail the bizarre succession of events that led to 
such a turnover in athletic directors, but the football coaches lost their jobs 
because of losing seasons. Coryell could never be fired for such a crime, 
because he never committed one. Gilbert had five consecutive winning seasons 
before two losing seasons out of three sent him packing. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Stolz took the Aztecs to their best season of the 1980s when they won the 
WAC championship and went to the Holiday Bowl in 1986. This being a 
less-than-patient program, Stolz was out as football coach by the end of a 
second consecutive losing season in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It should be clear by now that a "long-time" football coach at SDSU will be a 
football coach who wins for a long time. The margin for error seems to be about 
the size of a trigger finger. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem logical that Luginbill is aware of this pressure to win, 
especially since it seems to be historical in nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been asked about pressure a lot over the last nine months," he said, "but 
I guess I've been oblivious. We've just been working so doggone hard to make 
sure we dot the i's and cross the t's. I do believe the community is 
frustrated, but no one can convince me it's apathetic. Just look at this 
building." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill was sitting in his splendid office in the splendid Aztec Athletic 
Center, a facility built essentially for the football program by the San Diego 
Chapter of the Associated General Contractors and the San Diego Building and 
Trades Council. The only thing they forgot to do was make the entrance to the 
head coach's office a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for us to prove to the community that we deserve to be 
supported," he continued. "I put the onus on us. For whatever reasons, this 
program has been inconsistent. We've teased the community, and then we've 
fallen back. I don't want to be a tease." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill has a three-part formula for success that calls for a) playing with 
intensity on every down, b) leading the WAC in turnover margin and c) being the 
least-penalized team in the WAC. It may seem almost naively basic, but any team 
that accomplishes all three of those goals will win the WAC championship. 
</P>
<P>
It all begins for this latest SDSU coaching era with the season and WAC opener 
at Air Force on Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard," Luginbill said. "If anyone wants to judge us on Sept. 2, 
so be it. I asked Fred (Miller) if he could get that game back to San Diego on 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
And so Miller made arrangements for Al Luginbill's coaching debut to be shown 
live on Channel 51. 
</P>
<P>
Brave man, this Luginbill. He must think that Sept. 2 will have more to do with 
tradition than history.

DISTRAUGHT ALTERNATE NAMED TO STALKER JURY; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE WILL RULE ON REQUEST TO POLL PANEL ON ABILITY TO GO ON AFTER MURDER OF 
ONE MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid extraordinary courtroom drama Tuesday, a weeping and emotionally 
distraught woman alternate was randomly picked to replace a murdered juror in 
the Night Stalker case. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman's selection to fill the seat vacated by the weekend slaying of 
Phyllis Y. Singletary did not dispel the possibility of a mistrial in the 
serial murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan said he would rule this 
morning on a defense request to ask each of the remaining 12 jurors and seven 
alternates whether they can overcome the "terrible tragedy" and continue 
deliberating the fate of defendant Richard Ramirez, who could be sentenced to 
death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I will determine at that time if you can resume deliberations," Tynan told the 
jurors and alternates as many of them wept openly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can," the judge added. "I don't mean to be callous, but we have 
business to do." 
</P>
<P>
Singletary, 30, an employee in the billing department of Pacific Bell, was 
found Monday afternoon lying face down in her Carson apartment. She had been 
shot twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
The suspected murderer, James C. Melton, 51, Singletary's live-in boyfriend, 
killed himself with a bullet to the head Tuesday morning as authorities closed 
in on him at a Carson motel. A note he left behind said the murder-suicide 
stemmed from a domestic dispute, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court Tuesday, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Halpin said 
he opposed any questioning of jurors, saying that Tynan should direct the jury 
to resume deliberations anew today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that's necessary, or a good idea," Halpin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor also warned that any questioning of jurors and alternates may 
have the unintended effect of eliciting undue desires on their part to be 
excused. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances of (Singletary's) death, while apparently a homicide, have 
nothing to do with our task here," he said. "It appeared to be a domestic 
problem. Hopefully the jury will be able to distinguish between those issues." 
</P>
<P>
Still, if fewer than 12 of the 19 jurors and alternates say they are able to 
continue, then a mistrial might be inevitable, lawyers on both sides conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an issue we're going to have to deal with," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
In court Tuesday, the new juror -- obviously distraught over Singletary's death 
-- seemed immobilized and racked by convulsion as court clerk Josephine 
Williams called her name, after drawing it randomly from a gray metal box. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was unable to rise and take her new place in the jury box and Tynan 
urged her to remain seated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of Shooting Deaths 
</P>
<P>
During the six-month jury selection process that preceded the actual trial, the 
new panelist told the court that two of her brothers-in-law had been shot to 
death in Los Angeles, although she gave few details. One was killed during a 
robbery. The other's body was found near Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The new juror also said she had been burglarized twice, in 1987 and 1988. 
"Everything" was taken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys objected to her serving 
on the jury. Also still on the panel of alternates is a rape victim. 
</P>
<P>
News of Singletary's murder clearly shattered numerous jurors and alternates, 
many of whom arrived at the courthouse with grim expressions. 
</P>
<P>
And just before court convened, an alternate screamed and wept hysterically in 
the hallway outside the courtroom upon learning of the juror's death, 
apparently from a fellow alternate. She was escorted by jury colleagues into a 
nearby restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Assembled moments later in court, several other jurors and alternates also 
sobbed as a subdued Tynan officially broke the news, his voice cracking at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"Your friend and fellow juror has been shot," Tynan said, haltingly, his own 
eyes misting. "I think there is a tear in the eyes of a lot of us. 
</P>
<P>
"But that has nothing to do with this case," the judge continued. "It is simply 
irrelevant to this case . . . and does not add or diminish to the evidence of 
whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty or innocent." 
</P>
<P>
After the brief morning session, Tynan sent jurors home out of "decency," and 
ordered them back this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I know your grief is profound," the judge said. "Your grief must remain 
private." 
</P>
<P>
Tynan said he would also grant the panelists a day off to attend funeral 
services for Singletary. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sorry for all of you, and especially sorry for Ms. Singletary," 
Tynan said. "God bless all of you." 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, Daniel V. Hernandez, the chief lawyer for Ramirez, said he may 
ask for a mistrial today, a move that Halpin said he would oppose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls for a Steady Hand 
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now, above all, is a steady hand," Halpin said. "The murder of 
this lady has nothing to do with the task of this jury. The case must not go 
down the drain. I'm here to see that it does not. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many things that can cause a mistrial," the prosecutor said in a 
message that seemed intended for Tynan. "This should not be one of them. The 
parties involved must think about it. They must not take bad advice and we must 
do it not only within the law but with some reasonable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure this does not help the jurors psychologically," he continued. "But 
the death and the circumstances of her death have to be separated. I don't 
doubt that the other jurors and she became friendly over this period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Should the attorneys be allowed to question the panelists today, said Ray G. 
Clark, Ramirez's second lawyer, "I would ask them individually about their 
relationship (to Singletary), what bonding has taken place and whether or not 
they feel they are able to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer added: "It's an emotional thing that's gotten to all of us, not just 
the jury. And I'd like to hear from them. . . . This is unprecedented so far as 
I know, where one of the jurors fell victim to the same sort of acts that many 
of the victims in the main case did." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Ramirez did not comment to him about Singletary's murder, adding: 
"He's like the rest of us. Nobody is happy about this. This is a very sad 
thing. He's a human being, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition of Juror Noted 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez pointed out the inability of the newly chosen juror to take her new 
seat after being called. 
</P>
<P>
"That should have been a signal to the judge and to everyone there that this 
person is very affected emotionally, that there are certainly some potential 
problems with the jury at this point that require further inquiries, more 
investigations by the judge and the lawyers to determine exactly what is going 
on in their minds and in their hearts so we can determine whether they can 
continue to deliberate and to guarantee Mr. Ramirez a fair trial," the defense 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants a mistrial," Hernandez told reporters. "It's a very good jury. We 
love this jury. But if there are grounds that have to be researched and looked 
at that merit a mistrial -- because their objectivity has been destroyed -- we 
have an obligation and a responsibility to bring forth that motion." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the jurors, Hernandez added: 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a situation where they have all experienced something very similar 
to the crimes that Mr. Ramirez has been charged with -- the murder of a friend 
. . . gunshots . . . beating. Very similar to some of the crimes that were 
described by testimony. I think there are some very serious reservations here 
as to whether they can remain objective." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, is a charged with 13 murders and 
30 other felonies in a terrifying spree of residential burglaries throughout 
Los Angeles County, mostly in the spring and summer of 1985.

IRAN, SYRIA VOW TO CRUSH BEIRUT'S CHRISTIAN FORCES

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran, Syria and a phalanx of militias joined forces Tuesday in an open 
coalition to crush Christian power in war-torn Lebanon, as the Syrians 
unleashed increasingly fierce firepower on the besieged Christian enclave north 
of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
A communique drafted by Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh of Syria and his Iranian 
counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, along with representatives of more than 15 
Lebanese and Palestinian guerrilla commands, vowed a combined effort to 
"confront the dictatorial regime of Michel Aoun," the major general who leads 
the Christian-dominated Lebanese army. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Will Finish Aoun' 
</P>
<P>
One participant, George Hawi of the Lebanese Communist Party militia, put it 
more bluntly. Speaking to reporters and pistol-toting bodyguards outside a 
restaurant where the pact was reached, Hawi declared: "We will finish Aoun." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist warlord vowed that an offensive would start soon and that "Syria 
and Iran will support it materially and in every other way." The Damascus 
government reportedly nailed down a pledge by Tehran on Tuesday to help fund 
the militias for an escalated battle. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar called an emergency 
Security Council meeting, probably for today, in an effort to arrange a 
cease-fire in the 14-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. charter allows the secretary general to call such meetings in 
situations deemed threatening to international security. The last session of 
this sort was held in 1979 after Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pope John Paul II, in Castelgondolfo, Italy, added a forceful 
plea to the growing appeals for an end to the bloodshed. His voice shaking with 
emotion, the pontiff denounced the "genocide" taking place in Lebanon and 
accused Syria of wanting to destroy the country. 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of God, I turn to the Syrian authorities, asking them to stop the 
bombardment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, Christian-led forces, greatly outnumbered by Syrian soldiers, 
fought Syrian troops with tanks and artillery along the southern, eastern and 
northern edges of the 310-square-mile enclave north of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mountain Ridge 
</P>
<P>
At the southeastern edge of the enclave, Aoun's troops and Druze Muslim gunners 
traded artillery fire across the mountain ridge of Souq el Gharb, a strategic 
town overlooking Beirut where the Christian forces fought off a ground 
offensive Sunday. Syrian gunners also hit the 28-mile-long coastline in the 
enclave, the Christians' only escape route. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, 19 people were killed and 99 were wounded in the fighting. 
Since the renewed battles began last March, when Aoun launched a "war of 
liberation" to expel Syria's troops from Lebanon, 760 people have been killed 
and 2,045 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The pact announced in Damascus labeled Aoun a tool of "imperialistic, Zionist 
and reactionary regimes" and pledged combined support as well for Palestinian 
resistance to Israeli rule in the occupied territories of the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Militia leaders taking part included Walid Jumblatt, the Druze chieftain of the 
Progressive Socialist Party; Nabih Berri of the Shiite Muslim Amal forces, and 
Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command, a Syrian-based Palestinian group that has been implicated in terrorist 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to Hawi, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement "will 
take part in the war." Hezbollah has so far taken no direct role in the 
murderous artillery war in Beirut, but it has figured prominently in the 
concurrent hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference said the hostage issue was never raised, 
although Hezbollah representatives were present. Velayati, the black-bearded 
Iranian foreign minister, had arrived in Damascus on Monday, insisting that his 
trip had no relation to the hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here expressed uncertainty about the Tehran line. However, asked if 
Velayati and his Syrian counterpart had discussed the issue, one Western 
diplomatic observer responded: "They darn well better have." 
</P>
<P>
The vow to press the war against Aoun came 24 hours after a State Department 
spokesman in Washington accused Syria and its Lebanese allies of "an 
irresponsible escalation" of violence in Sunday's ground assault on Souq el 
Gharb. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, what the anti-Aoun coalition does show, the Western diplomatic 
observer said, is that "militias now are monetized again. Everybody needs their 
militias." 
</P>
<P>
Funding has been a persistent problem for the Lebanese militias, who reportedly 
pay their fighters about $200 a month in a competitive market. Some money 
formerly came from the Libyan government of Col. Moammar Kadafi, but Western 
intelligence sources have reported that Kadafi suspended payments last year. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has apparently agreed to take up the slack, in part because its longtime 
enemy, Iraq, has moved into the bloody game in Lebanon, supplying arms to the 
Christian-led forces. Nothing in the communique indicated Iranian armed forces 
would take a direct role. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq also is an ideological foe of Syria, whose Soviet-armed troops were sent 
into Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt touched on another sore point as he left the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get out of this destructive war," he told reporters, "but how can I 
when all the Arabs excepting Syria are supporting Michel Aoun?" 
</P>
<P>
The reference was clearly directed at the 22-member Arab League, whose latest 
peacemaking efforts collapsed three weeks ago. A committee from Saudi Arabia, 
Algeria and Morocco charged with finding a solution to the current battle of 
Beirut laid the blame on Syrian intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to defend ourselves," Jumblatt insisted, pointing to the attack at 
Souq el Gharb as a precursor to a new level of war in Lebanon. Although the 
assault was repulsed, Jumblatt -- whose Druze militia took part -- said it sent 
a message that "we can do anything, any time, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no red lines anymore," he concluded, suggesting that the informal 
boundary between Syrian and Israeli forces in southern Lebanon had no 
application between Christian and Muslim forces in the center of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France, which regards itself as protector of the Lebanese Christian 
population, said it was sending a frigate to the region "to be able to give 
whatever assistance is needed and to be capable of giving aid to the French 
community" in Lebanon.

'MY LIFE IS OVER,' VICTIM OF ATTACK BY GRIZZLY THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Coverston distinctly remembers the grizzly bear trying to pull his head 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"Both paws were on my shoulders and the teeth were biting into my head," he 
said. "I remember these grinding sounds, like rocks rubbing together. I 
remember thinking: 'Oh hell, this is really it. My life is over.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was only the beginning. During the next few hours, after surviving two 
attacks by the bear, Coverston dragged himself through thick woods, falling 
down at almost every step and terrified that the animal would attack again. He 
waded a swift, icy, waist-deep river and finally reached the only highway 
within miles. 
</P>
<P>
Bleeding from dozens of wounds, unable to see out of one eye and on the verge 
of shock, he fell to his knees and flagged down a car. His first question to 
the stunned motorists was: "Are my ears still on?" 
</P>
<P>
Coverston, 32, was eventually rushed by helicopter to the nearest hospital, 
more than 150 miles away, where he underwent 9 1/2 hours of surgery that 
required between 1,500 and 2,000 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Now, recuperating in his hospital room in Fairbanks, Coverston talks in 
painful, halting bursts. He said he feels like a human jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska has between 30,000 and 40,000 grizzly bears, according to recent 
government estimates. That is at least 30 times as many as the rest of the 
states combined, and encounters with them are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Grizzlies have been spotted on jogging trails in Anchorage, the state's largest 
city, and they are frequently seen at a distance by visitors to national parks. 
</P>
<P>
But attacks are rare -- usually only two or three statewide each summer. 
Coverston's was one of the worst in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
It happened on Aug. 5. Coverston, an aircraft electrician with the National 
Guard and a part-time college business student, had driven from his parents' 
home near Anchorage to 14 remote acres he has leased from the state near Denali 
National Park, halfway between Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
The land is a couple of miles off the Parks Highway, a two-lane ribbon that 
slices through dense boreal forest, mountains and treeless alpine tundra. The 
closest settlement, Cantwell, is 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Up on Kodiak Island 
</P>
<P>
Coverston, who grew up hunting and fishing in the wilderness of Kodiak Island, 
hopes to build a little cabin on the land some day. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that Saturday, he had seen bear tracks. Usually, when he is in the 
woods, Coverston carries a .357-caliber handgun for protection. But, this time, 
he took only a small camp ax to clear the thick alder brush that grows on the 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew better than to go into the woods alone, and I knew better than to go in 
unarmed," Coverston said, especially after seeing the tracks. "I'm not sure 
what I was thinking." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw Bear Charging 
</P>
<P>
About an hour into the woods, he heard crackling in the brush behind him, he 
said. He turned. A bear was perhaps 20 feet away and charging. 
</P>
<P>
"I yelled at it. I yelled, 'Get the hell out of here! What the hell do you 
think you're doing?' I figured my only defense was to scare it off." 
</P>
<P>
Like many Alaska grizzlies, the animal had a sun-bleached, almost blond coat, 
he said, and was not especially big by grizzly standards. On all fours, 
Coverston said, it came to about waist height. Coverston stands 5 feet, 10 
inches and weighs 160 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a few steps the other way and it kept coming. I took this little hand 
ax and tried to kill it," he said, laughing. He threw the ax and it hit the 
bear's head, but just bounced off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remembers Screaming 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I remember, I'm down on the ground," he said, speaking quickly. 
"I remember my skin being torn and I remember being bit and screaming at the 
top of my lungs. I was trying to get away . . . I got on my hands and knees and 
the bear picked me up by the neck and shook me." 
</P>
<P>
Abruptly, he said, the bear dropped him and retreated into the brush. A moment 
later, it came charging back. He said that the animal went "right for my head," 
pushing his shoulders with claws and pulling on his scalp with its teeth. Blood 
filled Coverston's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he decided to stop fighting and play dead. It worked. The animal 
dropped him, he said, disappeared into the woods and did not come back. 
</P>
<P>
"I lay there and decided I was alive," he said. With dusk approaching, he 
stumbled to his feet and began slowly making his way back to the road. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, I almost didn't want to make it 'cause I knew my head and neck were 
pretty bad." he said. At one point, he said, he tried to reposition his scalp 
with his hands and hold it in place with his baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors later found that the bear had sliced his neck from ear to ear and only 
narrowly missed his spinal cord and jugular vein. Although it did not damage 
his eyeball, a claw or tooth poked a hole two inches deep in the corner of his 
right eye, and he suffered bite and scratch wounds on his scalp, back, legs, 
hands and torso. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Wennen, the plastic surgeon at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital who 
worked on Coverston, said, "I've had other (bear attacks) that were 
significantly worse, (but) he's probably one of the luckiest ones I've ever 
seen. Any one of his injuries could have killed him if they'd been a little 
lower, or higher, or a little to the left or a little to the right." 
</P>
<P>
Coverston was amazed to find that his skull wasn't fractured and no other bones 
were broken. "I was so lucky," he said. Still, he said, the pain is sometimes 
severe, and he sleeps sitting in a chair because of his neck injuries. He 
passes the time visiting with his parents and friends. He will remain in the 
hospital at least several more days. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Van Dale, a wildlife biologist for the state Department of Fish and Game 
who has studied Alaska bears for years, said the attack, although rare, 
followed the pattern of most others. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost never see someone killed by a grizzly bear up here," Van Dale said. 
"The reason a bear attacks is because it sees a threat. When someone's moving 
or yelling, it sees a threat. When the person stops, it's not a threat any 
more, and it'll leave. We always say: 'When it happens, play dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to a state study, since the turn of the century 105 people have been 
reported injured by grizzly and black bears in Alaska, 20 of them fatally. 
</P>
<P>
Coverston said friends have talked about returning to the site "and bringing me 
back a bear skin rug." But he has no desire for revenge. He says he still wants 
to build a cabin on that property some day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a joke. People find out I grew up in Kodiak (known for its 
huge bears) and they say, 'Have you ever shot a bear?' Why would you shoot a 
bear? It's never interested me. I tell 'em me and the bears have an agreement 
-- I don't mess with them and they don't mess with me. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, this one broke the contract. Next time, it's: 'Hey buddy, I'm getting 
you before you get me.' " 
</P>
<P>

Times.

ENVIRONMENT BLOSSOMS AS JAPAN ISSUE

<P>
KUMOGAHATA, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deep in the range of small mountains north of Kyoto is a small Buddhist temple 
where for the past 11 centuries monks have been praying to assuage the 
capricious spirit of the Kamo River, protecting the ancient capital in the 
basin below from floods. 
</P>
<P>
The modern successor to that tradition has taken on a new duty: fighting a 
flood control project he believes will devastate these wooded hills and fill 
the river with silt. 
</P>
<P>
Shincho Tanaka, chief priest of Shimyoin Temple, accuses local officials of 
meeting in secret to plan an ill-advised and unnecessary pork-barrel dam that 
could be forced on residents before they have an opportunity to object. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Money at Root 
</P>
<P>
"They say they want to build a dam to prevent water damage and floods," Tanaka 
said, "but the momentum is coming from money, and in the long run it is only 
going to make the flooding worse." 
</P>
<P>
Local opposition to public works development is nothing new in Japan, but until 
now environmentalists have often waged losing battles because they came into 
the picture only after decisions were made and funds allocated. Tanaka's 
strategy is to intervene during the planning stages, before the project is set 
in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
His cause may seem parochial, but on a symbolic level the Kumogahata dispute 
has an international dimension. The very mentality of the officialdom that 
Tanaka is fighting is starting to attract notice abroad, where Japan's recent 
emergence as the world's largest aid donor is accompanied by tough scrutiny of 
its environmental track record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Aid Affected 
</P>
<P>
Critics are charging that Japanese development aid is sometimes distributed 
under the same rules of patronage and pork barrel that have made an ecological 
nightmare out of much of the natural habitat in the home islands. 
</P>
<P>
Most conspicuously, fragile rain forests in Southeast Asia are being seriously 
depleted by Japan's hardwood-hungry trading companies and by aid projects that 
build roads and infrastructure to foster irresponsible logging, the critics 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, conservationists denounce Japan for killing whales in a "scientific 
research" program, despite its agreement to abide by a worldwide ban on 
commercial whaling. The country also draws criticism for sheltering a lucrative 
import market for elephant ivory, hawksbill turtle shell and products from 
other endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
A rare unspoiled coral reef off Ishigaki Island in the Ryukyu chain is all but 
doomed by a landfill airport that officials seem determined to build over the 
adamant protests of international environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, Japan has confided that it wants to put its environmental 
house in order -- at least where foreign countries are concerned. Next month 
Tokyo will host its first international conference on the environment, having 
invited a cast of experts to advise it on matters such as how to administer 
foreign aid in a way that minimizes adverse environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
This comes after a Japanese pledge, made in July at the economic summit of the 
seven industrial nations in Paris, to spend about $2.2 billion on the 
environment over the next three years as part of a massive official development 
assistance program. The figure actually conceals a slight decrease on an annual 
basis from the amount already spent last year, but to the Japanese government 
it represents a commitment to something new. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Question of Vision 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is that the people of the world are going to be asking us what we plan 
to do with our money and technology, whether we have a philosophy or a vision," 
said Kazuo Matsushita, the Environmental Agency official organizing the Sept. 
11-13 World Conference on the Global Environment. "This forum is to discuss how 
to use the funds wisely." 
</P>
<P>
Some veteran observers are skeptical, however, about the government's motives 
in jumping on the environmental bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is still deeply involved in destroying the environment around the world, 
but they want to pose," said Katsuichi Honda, a senior reporter for the Asahi 
newspaper who is a noted naturalist and mountaineer. "It's not getting any 
better in Japan -- things are getting worse. There's no proof at all that (the 
conference) is the result of a serious effort to re-evaluate how we relate to 
the environment." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the flood control project in Kyoto cuts to the heart of 
the issue because its planners appear to be plodding ahead in the traditional 
Japanese approach, deliberating the alternatives in engineering without first 
pondering the environmental consequences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Protest Premature 
</P>
<P>
Toshiaki Honjo, the official in Kyoto prefecture's civil engineering department 
in charge of river projects, said the local protest movement is premature 
because an advisory council has not yet decided it is necessary to build a dam, 
as Tanaka and his fellow protesters allege. 
</P>
<P>
But Honjo said an environmental assessment study will not be commissioned until 
after it has been decided whether or not to build the dam, which would choke 
the river a few miles down the valley from its source near Tanaka's temple. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as an objective environmental assessment in this country 
-- they always come up with the results the government wants," said Tanaka, 49. 
"This isn't just a problem for Kumogahata or Kyoto, it's the world's problem. 
The Kamo is a river of the world." 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, Japan has an enviable record for controlling industrial air 
pollution and has set exhaust emission standards that are among the world's 
most rigorous. On that score, it can be expected to take a lead role in 
fighting the global warming trend and finding alternatives to 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemical coolants and solvents believed to deplete 
the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
But the Environmental Agency's Matsushita concedes that when it comes to public 
works, Japan simply looks bad. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a good record on impact assessment," he said, "especially in the 
planning stage." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the agency has tried repeatedly to get a law through Parliament that 
would require environmental impact assessments for major works such as flood 
control projects. But hampered by a brief 18-year history, limited manpower and 
a budget about one-tenth that of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the 
agency lacks sufficient clout to take on the more powerful Japanese ministries 
with vested interests in unencumbered development. 
</P>
<P>
What results is a pattern of guerrilla warfare, with residents and grass-roots 
environmental groups on one side and bureaucrats, local political bosses and 
agents of the construction industry on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The situation on Ishigaki Island is typical. During a decade of controversy 
over the $240-million airport project, the Okinawa prefectural government 
reluctantly undertook several environmental impact studies, the scientific 
integrity of which remains under a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offered Conciliatory Move 
</P>
<P>
In a posture of conciliation, the prefectural government announced in April 
that it would move the site of the airport by a few miles to limit damage to 
protect a rare colony of blue coral, but critics say construction will still 
destroy the surrounding reef. 
</P>
<P>
At the Nagara River estuary, near Nagoya in central Japan, environmental groups 
are fighting to halt the ongoing construction of another dam of disputed 
purpose -- designed to fit heavy industrial water needs in the 1960s. On 
Shikoku, the smallest of the four main islands, locals who say they were 
hoodwinked by the government into supporting an unneeded dam on the Shimanto 
River have begun a campaign to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
Amid these signs that the public is awakening to ecological concerns, however, 
the government has been pressing ahead in the spirit of the pork barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who originally proposed hosting next 
month's global environmental conference, introduced a sweeping "hometown 
development" program that foisted $740,000 "bonus" grants on about 3,200 rural 
municipalities during this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Aid to Buy Gold 
</P>
<P>
While most recipients hatched a bridge or road project to soak up the largess, 
the fishing village of Tsuna on Awaji Island rebelled by using the cash to buy 
a 127.6-pound gold ingot. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideas like environmental assessment and land use policy go against the grain 
of what this country has been based on," said Tom Milliken, director of Traffic 
(Japan), a Tokyo conservation group affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund. 
"Traditional care for nature has been lost in postwar Japan. They've been bent 
on economic construction." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese descend from a tribe that once worshiped rocks, rivers and trees, 
but one must stretch the imagination to see evidence of this today. 
</P>
<P>
A furor erupted earlier this year when a staff photographer for the Asahi 
newspaper took a shocking underwater photo of a coral reef that had been 
defaced with the initials "KY." It later was revealed that the photographer 
himself was the vandal. He was dismissed, and the newspaper's president 
resigned to take responsibility for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In the Kumogahata area, the virgin forests were cut down centuries ago and in 
their place now stand perfect patterns of pencil-shaped cedar, cultivated like 
rows of lettuce. These are the forests that Tanaka fears will perish to the 
debilitating effects of soggy soil and erosion if a dam is built. 
</P>
<P>
An almost perverse instinct to mold nature, rather than let it be, is 
demonstrated by the way that local timber men cultivate these trees, which are 
used for exposed pillars in the tokonoma -- ceremonial alcoves of traditional 
houses. Small worm-like pieces of plastic are wrapped tightly onto their bark, 
giving them a mottled look that purportedly has an aesthetic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Japan is the largest importer of tropical hardwood products, 
taking in about half such timber imported by industrialized countries, the 
Japan Tropical Forest Action Network said in a recent report. Much of the 
tropical wood is turned into plywood to mold concrete in the construction 
trade, and is thrown away when the cement dries. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese aid has helped fuel the destruction of the tropical forests by 
funding, for example, logging roads in the Sarawak region of Malaysia, where 
the indigenous Penan people are opposing the timber trade, according to the 
forest network. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advocacy Groups Snubbed 
</P>
<P>
Matters such as these might not emerge at all during next month's 
government-sponsored conference, however. Japan's advocacy environmental 
groups, or "non-government organizations (NGOs)," have been snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
"The bureaucrats don't want to have inconvenient discussions at the 
conference," said Fubomichi Kudo, an official with the Nature Conservation 
Society of Japan. "Talk of foreign aid, in particular, would hurt their ears." 
</P>
<P>
Having failed in attempts to pry open the government conference in Tokyo, the 
NGOs now plan to hold their own conferences in Kyoto and Osaka a few days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Japanese government's interest in the environment is a fad or a 
publicity stunt, aimed at currying favor in the international arena, remains to 
be seen, Kudo said. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment is a low risk cause to adopt -- nobody is going to be against 
it in any country," Kudo said. "But the real test will come when the conference 
is over, when we'll see to what extent the government takes responsibility and 
carries out its obligations."

THE NIGHT STALKER TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
FAIR TRIAL POSSIBILITY QUESTIONED AFTER DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Legal Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legal experts and psychologists said Tuesday that the slaying of a juror in the 
Night Stalker murder trial poses an extreme test of the American judicial 
system: How much stress can a jury handle and still render a fair verdict in a 
capital case? 
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that jurors' anger over the slaying could spill over into 
their deliberations, skewing them in favor of the prosecution, even though it 
appears that the defendant, Richard Ramirez, had nothing to do with the juror's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
These experts said jurors might try to be fair to Ramirez, but take their 
frustrations out on him unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that it could tend to make them conviction-prone," said Edith 
Greene, a nationally known social psychologist at the University of Colorado 
who studies jury behavior. "I've done some research on pretrial publicity that 
shows that even just exposing people to news stories on a series of heinous 
murders tends to make them more conviction-prone." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, predicted that jurors will be able to rise above the stress 
and strain and separate feelings of depression and anger over the sudden loss 
of a colleague from their consideration of the evidence in the six-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if there was any meaningful or significant influence on 
the ultimate trial verdict," said Donald E. Vinson, a sociologist and founder 
of Litigation Sciences Inc., a Los Angeles-based firm that has interviewed 
40,000 jurors for its own jury studies. 
</P>
<P>
"If these jurors are interviewed after their ultimate verdict," Vinson added, 
"I think it will be natural to say that the process of arriving at a verdict in 
a capital case is an extremely stressful and intense time in their lives. The 
death of a close associate is going to intensify that experience." 
</P>
<P>
But Vinson said he expected jurors will be able to treat the death as a 
"non-issue" if they were told by the judge that it was not connected to the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"In almost every case, jurors have great respect and admiration and deference 
to the judge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan has wide discretion on whether to declare 
the case a mistrial -- but precious little precedent. The only similar case may 
have occurred in the same courthouse earlier this year when a juror in another 
murder case was slain. 
</P>
<P>
The juror was a man sitting in the ongoing case of a Valencia obstetrician, Dr. 
Milos Klvana, who is charged with second-degree murder in the deaths of infants 
he delivered at his home. 
</P>
<P>
The juror's death, which authorities believed was the result of a domestic 
dispute unrelated to the trial, came near the start of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial Continued 
</P>
<P>
District attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said Superior Court Judge Judith 
Chirlin did not tell the other jurors that their colleague had died. She said 
she believes that Chirlin merely replaced the dead juror with an alternate 
without explaining why that juror was missing, and the trial continued. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of 10 of the legal and behavioral experts interviewed by telephone 
across the country Tuesday said he had heard of a case in which a juror had 
been slain. 
</P>
<P>
That expert, Robert Hanley, a Denver attorney who is former chairman of the 
American Bar Assn.'s litigation section, said he recalled hearing about a juror 
being slain at a defendant's request, but only vaguely. He said he could not 
remember the name of the case. 
</P>
<P>
In the Night Stalker case, Tynan elected to inform jurors of the death of their 
colleague in the wake of wide news coverage of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge, who asked for anonymity because he did not want to be accused 
of trying to influence Tynan's decision on whether to grant an expected defense 
request for a mistrial, said he thought that "it would be very difficult not to 
grant one." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that it would be hard to argue that the shooting death of 
the juror would not produce bad feelings toward a defendant accused of shooting 
others to death. But he said Tynan's decision could ultimately rest on his 
evaluation of the strength of the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
"If the evidence (of guilt) is overwhelming, he might be inclined not to grant 
a mistrial," this judge said, on the theory that animosity toward the defendant 
because of the juror's death would have only incidental impact. "But if it's a 
close case, he might be more inclined to grant a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts, including the American Bar Assn.'s Hanley, said: "If I were 
defense counsel in that case, I'd be scared to death that somebody was going to 
attribute that death to my client or to one of his friends." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Sufficient Grounds 
</P>
<P>
But Hanley said defense counsel's fear is not sufficient grounds to declare a 
mistrial. Unless jurors were questioned and declared that they blamed the death 
on the defendant, Hanley said, a mistrial would not be warranted, nor would the 
lack of one be grounds for reversal of a conviction on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Penrod, a psychologist and lawyer who studies jury behavior, said there 
is a "reasonable chance" that the slaying will turn jurors in the Night Stalker 
against the defendant, but there is almost no chance that they would 
acknowledge this prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
Penrod, co-author of the book "Inside the Jury" and a professor of law at the 
University of Minnesota, said they may not even be aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
He said jurors understand that their deliberations are not supposed to be 
influenced by events outside the courtroom and try hard to remain fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the jurors, like virtually all the rest of us, are motivated to 
present ourselves . . . in a manner that will make it look like we are doing 
the appropriate things. Jurors will say not only to the judge, but to 
themselves, that they have done the appropriate thing," Penrod predicted, 
making it extremely difficult for the defense to come up with hard evidence 
that jurors were prejudiced.

WATER RIGHTS PACT WITH L.A. WINS APPROVAL IN INYO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angering a roomful of opponents, the Inyo County Board of Supervisors voted 
Tuesday for an unprecedented pact with Los Angeles that would let the city take 
more water from distant Owens Valley while forbidding future damage there to 
vegetation and wells. 
</P>
<P>
If also approved in Los Angeles, the agreement would cool 70 years of rivalry 
between the city and officials of the mountain and high desert county where Los 
Angeles has obtained most of its water since engineer William Mulholland 
christened his 240-mile aqueduct with the words, "There it is. Take it." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the agreement will soothe the citizenry of Owens Valley, however, was 
left unclear by the unanimous vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, nearly 200 local ranchers and other residents had turned out at a 
community meeting where the agreement was widely derided. On Tuesday, an 
overflow crowd showed at the County Courthouse in Independence for the vote, 
and all but one speaker opposed the pact. Immediately after the vote, Beverly 
Brons of Bishop unveiled what she said were recall petitions against the five 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which has been in negotiations between Inyo officials and the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power since 1985, was the second version to 
meet with strong public disapproval in Owens Valley this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Inyo supervisors and Los Angeles officials held a ceremony to 
introduce the agreement to local residents. The leaders hailed it as a historic 
step, but heavy opposition among residents forced the supervisors to 
reconsider. They persuaded Los Angeles to reopen negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The second version approved Tuesday includes some stronger language on 
protections for private wells and vegetation in Owens Valley. Before the vote, 
Inyo supervisors said the revised agreement was the best they could obtain. In 
exchange, Los Angeles could sink new wells and increase the amount of water 
pumped into the aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vocal Supporter 
</P>
<P>
Mary Dedecker, the most vocal Owens Valley supporter of the agreement, said the 
supervisors were right to approve the pact. "It is an improvement over the 
original concept," Dedecker said. "Our valley is adequately protected." 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents said they are skeptical about promises that the pact will 
require Los Angeles to shut down any ground water pump found to be hurting the 
environment or lowering nearby wells. Many Owens Valley residents blame Los 
Angeles pumps for a widespread die-off of trees. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also said the people should be allowed to vote on the agreement. "So 
many people are against it," said Joy Wilson of Lone Pine. "It's like my 
daughter marrying the man who has been robbing her. What kind of democracy is 
this? Why can't we vote on it?" 
</P>
<P>
Charles Hunter of Aberdeen added that "you should not railroad this agreement 
through. Put it on the ballot in November." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition also came from local officials in Mono County to the north, where 
Los Angeles also obtains water for the aqueduct from streams that supply Mono 
Lake. Two Town Council members from Mammoth Lakes, Barbara Campbell and Kirk 
Stapp, urged the Inyo supervisors to hold off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Rush This' 
</P>
<P>
"It affects all of us (in the eastern Sierra), not just Inyo County," said 
Campbell. "Please don't rush this." 
</P>
<P>
However, Supervisor H. B. (Lefty) Irwin, who made the motion to approve the 
pact, said that the supervisors, their staff and the staff of the county water 
commission were all unanimously agreed that the pact was a good deal for Inyo 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The pact would avoid a courtroom clash between Inyo and Los Angeles and 
peacefully settle lawsuits that each has filed against the other, Inyo 
officials said. If Inyo had pressed its case that ground water pumping by Los 
Angeles should be restricted, the county might have lost any power to regulate 
the pumping, Inyo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Los Angeles and Inyo County are to cooperate on an 
environmental impact report on the ground water pumping. Two earlier reports by 
Los Angeles have been rejected by courts as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Before the agreement becomes final, the Los Angeles City Council and Mayor Tom 
Bradley must approve the terms.

SENATOR'S DEPUTY AIDED FIRM THAT GAVE HIM LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After receiving a $20,000 loan from a City of Industry company, the top aide to 
state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) intervened last year on behalf 
of the firm as it sought a million-dollar state contract, records and 
interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome M. Haleva placed a telephone call to John S. Babich, deputy director of 
the state's office of procurement, last June to inquire why United Packaging 
Corp. faced disqualification even though it was the low bidder on a contract to 
supply garbage bags to state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The call came 16 months after the company and its president, Frank E. Raper, 
gave Haleva a $20,000 mortgage loan at 8% interest -- a rate that industry 
experts say was 2% to 3% lower than those available through conventional 
lendings institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Babich said last week that the timing of Haleva's call was "unusual" because it 
came after the bids were open and the firm was facing disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of stuck in my mind because of the dollar value and the sensitivity of 
the contract," Babich said. "I'm sensitive about plastic bags because we spend 
so much money on them." 
</P>
<P>
The procurement official said Haleva's inquiry had no effect on the way his 
office handled the garbage bag contract. But he acknowledged that he 
subsequently directed his staff to amend the bid specifications, which allowed 
United Packaging to eventually win the $1.6-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva, a veteran political figure who receives $80,000 a year as Campbell's 
chief assistant, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Raper did not return repeated calls to his United Packaging office. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, when reached at his Hacienda Heights home and asked about 
Haleva's actions, Campbell hung up on a Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disclosure Process 
</P>
<P>
While Haleva disclosed the loan on state economic interest forms as required by 
law, he did not report receiving any benefit from the below-market interest 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the state's Fair Political Practices Commission said this 
week that such a discount on a loan of that size would generally have to be 
disclosed by a legislator or aide as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
"If the person is receiving a loan on terms that are not available to the 
public," FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku explained, "the difference in value 
is considered a gift and would have to be reported if the total value is $50 or 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Haleva's call on behalf of United Packaging was at least the second time in 
1988 that he contacted state contract officials on behalf of a company with 
financial ties to himself or his boss. 
</P>
<P>
The first instance involved calls placed by Haleva to the state architect's 
office on behalf of Asbestos Environmental Controls, a Louisiana company that 
contributed $27,000 to Campbell's election committee during 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva's discussions with the state architect occurred as the Louisiana company 
was in danger of losing its asbestos-removal consulting contracts because it 
had failed to receive state certification for the work. After Haleva's calls, 
the architect's office withdrew its threat to cancel the contracts and waited 
for the firm to properly register. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the political donations, the president of Asbestos Environmental 
Controls provided Campbell and Haleva with the use of a car and driver during 
the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans. Neither the senator nor 
Haleva reported the gifts, valued at $600, until after it was revealed in 
newspaper reports in June. 
</P>
<P>
State records show that United Packaging's Raper has also been an active 
political contributor, giving nearly $15,000 last year to Republican 
legislators and committees. He also gave $1,000 to Campbell's campaign 
committee on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm's dealings with Haleva date back to at least Feb. 19, 1987. 
Sacramento County records show that the company lent Haleva $20,000 at 8% 
annual interest, securing it on that date with a second trust deed on his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deed Rescinded 
</P>
<P>
At the time, conventional lenders were offering home equity loans at an average 
of 12% interest nationally and 11.37% in Southern California, according to 
statistics compiled by the Meyers Report of Chicago, a national financial 
newsletter. In addition, three large California banks separately told The Times 
that they were offering such loans at 10% to 10.5% interest at about that time. 
</P>
<P>
Property records do not disclose the term and conditions of the loan or how 
Haleva planned to use the money. But they show that Raper rescinded the second 
trust deed on June 2, 1987, indicating that the debt had been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
United Packaging has sold twine and garbage bags in bulk to the state since at 
least 1983, purchasing records show. The garbage bags are acquired by the 
state's Department of General Services, which in turn supplies them to all 
state agencies from warehouses in Sacramento and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that procurement officials have sent numerous written complaints 
to United Packaging about late shipments and claims that many of the deliveries 
have fallen short of the number of bags ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those concerns, United Packaging was in the thick of the competition 
for the fiscal 1988-89 contract to supply garbage bags when bids were opened in 
May, 1988. United Packaging's $1.47-million proposal was the lowest of 10 
companies submitting bids. 
</P>
<P>
But United Packaging's offer contained at least one variation: Company 
officials wrote that they needed 12 weeks to make deliveries, rather than the 
six weeks specified in the contract requirements. 
</P>
<P>
While the other companies said they could meet the six-week requirement, United 
Packaging said its shipments would be delayed because an explosion at a 
Louisiana resin plant had created a shortage of material used to make the 
polyethylene trash liners. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stated inability to meet the six-week specification prompted 
state officials to consider disqualifying the firm from the competition -- a 
decision that brought a protest from Raper. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter on June 21, 1988, Raper wrote to a procurement official that he was 
"surprised to hear that you consider this to be more than a minor deviation 
from the request of the contract. . . . The most surprising thing to me is the 
fine lines being drawn when evaluating bids of this kind, using the Standard 
Policies and Procedures you made reference to, which we haven't been confronted 
with in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy procurement director Babich said that at about the same time, Haleva 
called on behalf of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Haleva called by telephone and said that one of his constituents had a 
problem involving a bid with plastic bags and he (Haleva) wanted to know what 
the circumstances were," Babich recalled. "And I listened to him and explained 
the facts of the bid, that the low bidder took material exception" to the 
six-week deadline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Response 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was seeking information for the constituent," said Babich. "In 
other words, 'Why isn't the constituent's bid acceptable?' " 
</P>
<P>
Babich said when he explained the problem with United Packaging's bid, Haleva 
answered: " 'Fine. Thanks for the information'." 
</P>
<P>
Babich stressed that he did not feel any "undue influence" on the part of 
Haleva, but added that it is unusual for anyone from a legislative office to 
call the procurement office after bids have been opened for a contract. Most of 
the time, legislative aides call before bids are even taken to see what 
companies must do to qualify for state contracts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the next lowest bidder on the garbage bags was about $300,000 higher than 
United Packaging, Babich asked his staff to conduct a telephone survey to 
investigate whether the City of Industry company's complaint was valid. The 
survey concluded that a six-week delivery deadline was "not realistic," Babich 
said, so state officials canceled the first bids and ask for new quotes on the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the contract specifications allowed for a 12-week delivery. Of the 
12 companies that competed, United Packaging, at $1.6 million, was again the 
lowest bidder, but this time at $1.62 million -- $150,000 more than its initial 
bid. The company was awarded the contract to supply trash liners through 
October of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the extended deadline time, United Packaging has been cited by the 
state five times since March for late shipments.

DENG'S 'RE-EDUCATION DRIVE' AIMED AT BOLSTERING HIS VISION OF CHINA

<P>
Despite the sweltering August heat, thousands of Chinese poured into the 
People's Revolutionary Military Museum for the daily dose of official culture 
and history. 
</P>
<P>
They filed past glass cases containing blood-soaked army T-shirts, charred 
rifles, Molotov cocktails, broken bits of bricks, smashed loudspeakers, cracked 
helmets and crumpled shields. They were led into a makeshift theater where they 
were shown the government version of the pro-democracy student protests that 
were broken up June 3-4 with much bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
They were led past wallboard exhibits that describe the "heroics" of the 
People's Liberation Army in the crackdown, an action that Western analysts and 
independent observers describe as a massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the visitors remained silent. Only a few were bold enough to 
remark that visiting the museum was not their idea. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's hospitality guide told two visiting Americans on Monday that more 
than 1 million people have now seen the two-week-old "Turmoil Exhibit," or, as 
it is called officially, the "Exhibit of the Quelling of the 
Counterrevolutionary Rebellion." Attendance is mandatory for all Beijing 
workers as part of the new leadership's national re-education process, which 
the government calls "cultural rectification." 
</P>
<P>
Although different in ideology and scope from Mao Tse-tung's Cultural 
Revolution of the 1960s and '70s, the campaign under the leadership of Deng 
Xiaoping is aimed chiefly at reinforcing Deng's vision of Chinese society and 
the Communist Party of China. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's campaign has targeted everything from literature and journalism to 
pornography and pop music, from political ideology to video games, from movie 
houses to tea rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Under Deng's direction, the orthodox party hierarchy has used a dual strategy 
of censorship and substitution to carry out its campaign. The casualties have 
been human as well as material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Writers, Historians Targeted 
</P>
<P>
In June, when the party leadership started its crackdown on the liberal and 
progressive forces of Zhao Ziyang, the ousted party chief, many of Zhao's 
supporters in the political hierarchy were purged. But in the last month 
several key writers, historians and ideologues in the government's Ministry of 
Culture and the Press and Publications Administration -- the powerful 
censorship bureau -- have also been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said Monday that the leadership has decided to replace the 
minister of culture as well as two vice ministers, including Ying Ruocheng, who 
gained world fame as the gentle prison warden in the Academy Award-winning film 
"The Last Emperor." 
</P>
<P>
Ying, whose movie character was purged in the Cultural Revolution, was 
personally criticized by the party's aging conservatives when the film was 
being made because he helped arrange for it to be filmed inside Beijing's 
Forbidden City. Nonetheless, he kept his government post as vice minister of 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Ying's pending, real-life purge is seen by several Chinese artists as an 
especially bitter example of life imitating art. 
</P>
<P>
Culture Minister Wang Meng, who was removed last week from his post as 
secretary of the party's cultural committee because of his liberal ideas, is 
soon to be replaced as minister by a hard-liner with a background in 
propaganda, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
On the material side, the campaign has been even more sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
It has been extended to virtually every province, and millions of copies of 
books, magazines and video and audio tape cassettes have reportedly been 
confiscated or destroyed. Booksellers have been fined or jailed. New museum 
exhibits are carefully screened, as are all new films and publications. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing developments in the campaign, the state-run New China News Agency 
has said repeatedly that the materials confiscated or destroyed were found to 
be "vulgar" or "anti-communist" or to be based on "pornography, feudal 
superstition or bourgeois liberalization." 
</P>
<P>
In one province, hundreds of videocassettes deemed pornographic were publicly 
crushed by a steamroller. In another, thousands of copies of outlawed magazines 
were burned. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency reported that in the city of Xian, "pornographic 
publications . . . suffered a disastrous fate" when 4,000 government agents 
raided 900 bookstalls and confiscated tens of thousands of books, magazines and 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
The government has taken to calling such material "cultural opium." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Indoctrination 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners have not stopped at confiscation and prosecution. They have 
devised a vast array of neo-conservative cultural programming for "misguided" 
party members and government workers. This program of substitution has been as 
intensive as the purge. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists, editors and educators have been subjected to frequent political 
indoctrination seminars. Party instructors have lectured dancers, singers and 
actors in ballrooms and tea houses. Government censors have inspected 
video-game parlors for games with sexual or political overtones and have 
replaced many with games considered ideologically respectable. 
</P>
<P>
The most intensive substitution programs have been concentrated in Beijing, the 
center of the student unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Tian An Men Square, which was the focal point of the student activity, is 
closed to the public, but it was filled this week with hundreds of movie actors 
and extras for the filming of a government television special to be aired over 
several days leading up to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's 
Republic on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The film, one of several recent government productions, reportedly will 
emphasize the need for strict adherence to the pure ideology that was the 
backbone of the Chinese Communist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Another recent government film, "The 100 Colors Uprising," glorifies the 
84-year-old Deng Xiaoping as a young revolutionary who led a key battle against 
the nationalist forces in the late 1920s. Now in its third week in theaters 
throughout the country, the film has been required viewing for government 
workers, who are given free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the campaign is having any effect on a population that has been exposed 
to years of reform under Zhao and other progressives is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver who had a copy of a banned book, a paperback detective story 
entitled "The Case of China's Biggest Con Man," laughed when he was asked how 
he had managed to buy a book that was banned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy," he said. "All the booksellers still have them. You just ask for a 
'yellow' book, show your identity card to prove you don't work for the police, 
and you buy it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book on Crafty Embezzler 
</P>
<P>
Such "yellow" books are not really pornographic, the cabbie said. His book, he 
said, tells of a crafty Chinese citizen who embezzled nearly $20 million 
without getting caught. It is plots like this, he said, that account for the 
popularity of such books. 
</P>
<P>
"When people read the book, they think this guy is really cool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another reason for what he and several other Beijing residents 
called a resurgence in the popularity of such books, and it bodes ill for the 
success of the government's cultural rectification campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason," the driver said, "is that as soon as the government bans a 
book or a magazine, for whatever reason, the first thing people want to do is 
run out and buy it. People think there must be some great, mysterious reason 
why it has been banned, and they want to get it before it's sold out."

A Chinese passenger plane faltered during takeoff Tuesday and plunged into a 
river near the Shanghai airport, killing 34 people, the official New China news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Television news said the Antonov-24, a twin turboprop of Soviet design, carried 
32 passengers and eight crew members. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said rescuers were trying to extricate survivors from the 
wreckage near Hongqiao airport, 12 miles north of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted witnesses as saying the plane seemed to go out of 
control as it became airborne, then plunged into the river about 100 yards from 
the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 5510 of China Eastern Airlines, a subsidiary of the national Civil 
Aviation Administration of China, was bound for Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi 
province in southern China, about 400 miles southwest of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Chinese air accident since August, 1988, when a flight from 
Canton crashed while landing at Hong Kong, killing seven people. 
</P>
<P>
Five major crashes, which killed 172 people, were reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hu Yizhou, head of the national airline, said early this year there were 
"serious problems" with safety and called for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The worst death toll last year was in a crash near Chongqing in the southwest 
that killed all 108 people on the aircraft.

PHILIPPINE PRISON STANDOFF ENDS; 5 HOSTAGES DIE

Troops rushed a Philippine prison Tuesday and shot to death 16 convicts who had 
been holding members of a religious group hostage for three days. Five 
hostages, including a 9-year-old boy, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials decided to storm the prison after some of the 15 hostages escaped and 
told them the would-be escapees had killed other captives. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not . . . dealing with reasonable people," said Justice Undersecretary 
Silvestre Bello, who was involved in negotiations with the captors. "We had to 
authorize a military operation, especially since there was an urgent need to 
save the five living hostages." 
</P>
<P>
The attack began about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firing automatic weapons 
and secured the downtown jail in Davao, 610 miles southeast of Manila, after 
about 40 minutes, witnesses and officials said. Officials said no hostages were 
killed in the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostages as Shields 
</P>
<P>
A few hours earlier, the convicts had tried to escape by using hostages as 
shields. During the confusion, a captive was killed, and five others fled. They 
told police four other hostages had been slain. The dead, besides the 
9-year-old boy, included a 16-year-old female hostage and Australian missionary 
Jacqueline Hamill, 36, who had been in Davao a month. 
</P>
<P>
All of the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a Protestant 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff began Sunday at the Metropolitan District Command Center in Davao. 
Bello said inmates overpowered a guard during a Bible session at the prison and 
then looted weapons from an armory. 
</P>
<P>
Police said most of the inmates had escaped in April from the Davao Penal 
Colony and seized several hostages to protest conditions at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the convicts was identified as Mohammed Naser Samparani, a former 
air force soldier convicted of murder.

Leaders of the anti-Israeli uprising on Tuesday ordered Palestinians in the 
occupied West Bank to boycott their jobs in Israel for a week to protest 
restrictive new measures imposed on Arabs in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The order for a seven-day strike, which would be the longest in the 
20-month-old uprising, came along with a call for "more stones and knives" in 
fighting Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian man died Tuesday of a gunshot wound suffered a day earlier in a 
clash with soldiers, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen other Palestinans were reported shot and wounded Tuesday in 
confrontations with soldiers in the occupied lands, according to Arab reports. 
One of the victims, a 14-year-old girl from the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, 
was reported in critical condition with a bullet in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising said in a communique that 
the strike should begin Friday, the day the army begins enforcing a new rule 
that requires Gaza Strip Palestinians to show computerized ID cards to enter 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Cards are denied anyone considered a security risk. 
</P>

More than 50,000 Gazans work in Israel, as do about 60,000 Palestinians from

PUBLIC STILL OPPOSES QUAYLE AS PRESIDENT, POLL INDICATES 
</P>

A year after his selection as George Bush's running mate, Vice President Dan 
Quayle has failed to convince most Americans that he is qualified to take over 
the presidency and seems to be making little progress in improving his 
standing, a new Washington Post-ABC Poll indicates. 
</P>
<P>
In the Aug. 4 to 8 survey of 1,022 respondents, 52% said that Quayle was not 
qualified to take over the Oval Office if something happened to the President, 
and 38% said he was qualified. 
</P>
<P>
As a candidate, Bush listed ability to take over the White House as his No. 1 
requirement for a running mate. 
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of those questioned do not yet have an opinion about Quayle's job 
performance. Quayle's approval rating dropped over the last two months, but so 
did the number of those who disapprove of him, while the undecided segment 
grew. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, in an interview, said he now feels "confident in the job . . . . I 
think we are off to a good, steady start." He attributed the gap between his 
popularity and Bush's to his rough campaign and to the fact that he is new on 
the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
About 43% of those questioned approve of the way Quayle is handling his job, 
compared to 22% who disapprove, and 34% had no opinion. That puts the vice 
president's approval rate about 25 points below Bush's. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking down the numbers by race, the poll found that 46% of whites approved 
of Quayle's performance but only 27% of blacks did. 
</P>
<P>
Those questioned are closely divided on whether Bush made a mistake in choosing 
Quayle. Forty-three percent said he did, but 47% said he did not. When asked if 
Bush should pick someone else as a running mate if he seeks a second term, 43% 
said he should, but 38% said he should not. Nineteen percent had no opinion.

$2-BILLION PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS BACKED BY BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
BUT PRESIDENT REFUSES TO SAY WHERE FINANCING OF STRATEGY DEVISED BY BENNETT 
WILL BE FOUND

<P>
President Bush Tuesday endorsed the anti-drug strategy developed by his drug 
policy director, William J. Bennett, but refused to say where he will find the 
money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
With Administration aides estimating that the program could cost $2 billion a 
year above existing anti-drug expenditures, Bush conceded at a press conference 
that "we will have to do some reallocation of resources." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a period of hard times," he said. He ruled out raising taxes and said 
that he has not decided what programs to cut to make room for the new anti-drug 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said that Bush has endorsed one of the most expensive and potentially 
far-reaching items in the plan -- a proposal to more than triple military and 
economic aid to help Bolivia, Colombia and Peru fight their drug producers and 
to offer those countries U.S. military advisers to train their own forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limits on DEA 
</P>
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration "isn't big enough or strong enough to solve 
the problems in these various South American countries," Bush said at the press 
conference -- a statement designed to indicate acceptance of Bennett's plan, a 
White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
While many law enforcement officials and members of Congress have been harshly 
critical of the shortcomings in Latin American nations' anti-drug programs, 
Bush defended them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there has to be some measuring of intention," Bush said. Many Latin 
American nations would like to help but simply cannot because they have been 
"ripped asunder by the drug cartels," he added, citing Colombia in particular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Issues 
</P>
<P>
In a typically wide-ranging discussion of issues, Bush also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repeated his hints that Panama's armed forces should consider moving 
against their chief, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who has been indicted by U.S. 
prosecutors on drug charges. "Our argument is not with the Panamanian Defense 
Forces, it is with Mr. Noriega himself," Bush said. "If he were to go out. . , 
we would instantly have better relations with Panama." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supported the criticism of Federal Reserve Board policies that his budget 
director, Richard G. Darman, voiced in a televised interview Sunday. Darman 
suggested that Fed policies are keeping interest rates too high and running the 
risk of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any President, now or in the past, who doesn't favor lower 
interest rates," Bush quipped. "That's the American way. . . . I thought what 
Dick Darman said was very balanced. I can feel very comfortable with his 
sallying forth and saying that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expressed sympathy for the families of two congressmen killed in airplane 
crashes in the last week. The deaths of Reps. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and Larkin 
Smith (R-Miss.) "remind us that there are outstanding men and women in public 
life who are working at every level of government to better the lot of 
mankind," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Drug Problem 
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, the drug problem, which Bush called "an issue that 
tears at the heart and feeds the fears of every American," has been the main 
domestic policy issue at the White House. Aides have been hurrying to complete 
most work on Bennett's package before Bush departs for his Maine vacation 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading to Maine, Bush will detour to make a campaign stop in Miami on 
behalf of Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is a candidate in the Aug. 29 
election to replace the late Rep. Claude Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
The drug plan, Bush said in a statement at the beginning of his press 
conference, is "balanced, decisive, effective and achievable." Carrying it out 
"will call for commitment and sacrifice and understanding, but it's clear to me 
the American people demand no less." 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans to unveil the drug-fighting strategy formally in a televised speech 
Sept. 5, but most of Bennett's recommendations already have been leaked to the 
press. Bush has approved most of those proposals, although aides are expected 
to continue hashing out details while he is on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
License Revocations 
</P>
<P>
One proposal that probably will not be adopted is to require states to revoke 
the driving licenses of drug offenders or lose federal highway construction 
money. In meetings so far, an Administration official said, senior Bush 
advisers have been negative toward the idea because it smacks of federal 
meddling in state business. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress passed what it hailed as a major anti-drug bill authorizing 
$2.7 billion in new programs. But less than half that money actually has been 
put into the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bush so far has ruled out raising taxes to pay for his new drug program, and 
his aides have insisted that they will find ways to pay for it without doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
See Bush Taking Credit 
</P>
<P>
Many congressional Democrats, however, fear that Bush will seek to gain credit 
for the program while leaving them the onerous task of deciding what other 
popular programs to eliminate to make room for the new spending. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a statement issued 
after Bush's press conference, called for a "massive commitment of resources" 
to the war on drugs. "If that means raising taxes to pay for drug-fighting 
measures, so be it," Biden said.

OBSERVERS EXPECT FEW DRAMATIC CHANGES UNDER DE KLERK; 
</P>
<P>
S. AFRICA'S NEW LEADER A LIFELONG CONCILIATOR 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Politics was an abiding presence in the close-knit De Klerk household in the 
old days, and the oldest son, Willem, a renegade liberal, was frequently 
embroiled in heated arguments with the father, Jan, a government Cabinet 
minister and steadfast defender of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
As often as not, the confrontations were smoothed over by Willem's younger 
brother, Frederik. 
</P>
<P>
"He always tried to explain both sides to me and to our father, bargaining for 
a conciliation between us," Willem de Klerk, now 60, remembered Tuesday. "Even 
as a small boy, his role always was to find solutions to problems, to suggest 
reconciliation over confrontation. He had a lot of success, too." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Frederik W. de Klerk, the 53-year-old man whom friends and 
even rivals describe as a gifted negotiator and pragmatist, was sworn in as 
acting president of South Africa in a six-minute ceremony at Pretoria's hilltop 
Union Buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Courage and Vision' 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, expected to guide South Africa into the next decade as head of its 
white minority-led government, expressed the hope that South Africans will 
"show the courage and vision required to break the cycle of conflict, tension 
and isolation which has gripped us for so long -- and to work for a new, strong 
and just South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
The acting president also paid tribute to his 73-year-old predecessor, Pieter 
W. Botha, who resigned Monday night after months of bitter feuding with his 
Cabinet and his party over being unceremoniously forced earlier this year to 
plan his retirement after parliamentary elections next month. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, education minister under Botha, will take over as president in his 
own right on Sept. 14 if, as is widely expected, the powerful ruling National 
Party maintains its majority in the white chamber of Parliament after elections 
Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know De Klerk best say his presidency will differ significantly in 
style, if not necessarily in substance, from Botha's. 
</P>
<P>
Although De Klerk has called for a new constitution to give the disfranchised 
black majority a voice in national affairs, he still supports the National 
Party's longstanding policy of racially segregated residential areas, schools 
and hospitals, as well as its opposition to the idea of one person, one vote. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many political analysts here and abroad have pinned their hopes 
for a peaceful resolution of South Africa's troubles on De Klerk's personality. 
Where Botha was a dictatorial and ruthless ruler who created a one-man 
executive government, De Klerk is a team player, highly intelligent, affable 
and reasonable, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lawyer's lawyer, a Mr. Fix-it and a master of parliamentary procedure 
and rational thinking," said Robert Shrire, a professor of political studies at 
the University of Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since his selection as Botha's heir-apparent, De Klerk has 
consulted with world leaders, who have expressed high hopes for his presidency. 
But many who have followed De Klerk's career warn against expecting too much 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, he's a tremendous improvement over what we've had," said Johann 
van der Vyfer, a professor of law and a college classmate who was best man at 
De Klerk's wedding. "But I don't see dramatic changes in government policy. He 
will encourage an exchange of ideas, but he's always been an Establishment man. 
And he still sits closer to the right side of Afrikanerdom than the left." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's brother, Willem, whose liberal leanings caused him to break with the 
National Party several years ago, says the new president's strength is his 
ability to bring people together, which could be useful after Botha's repeated 
failure to bring recognized black leaders to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
But "he's still very much linked to the National Party tradition," including 
the notion that racial groups should be the building blocks of a new 
constitution, said Willem, who is a professor of communications at Rand 
Afrikaans University in Johannesburg. "I really hope that he will be 
open-minded enough to realize that (maintaining) race groups is part of the 
problem, not part of the solution," he went on. 
</P>
<P>
The De Klerk brothers are scions of an old Afrikaner family with deep roots in 
the country and in the National Party. Their grandfather was imprisoned by the 
British during the Anglo-Boer War and later played a leading role in developing 
the National Party, which instituted sweeping apartheid legislation after it 
came to power 41 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father a Cabinet Minister 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom was an uncle, and their father was a 
Cabinet minister for 14 years in the 1950s and '60s, serving under two prime 
ministers and helping write more apartheid legislation into the law books. 
</P>
<P>
Frederik studied law at Pochefstroom University, where Willem, eight years 
older, had acquired a reputation as a liberal Afrikaner. Friends say Frederik 
embraced more conservative ideals in an unconscious attempt to move out of the 
shadow of his respected older brother. 
</P>
<P>
Frederik graduated with honors and briefly practiced law before entering 
politics, where he quickly became known as one of the more conservative members 
of the ruling National Party hierarchy. But political observers find him 
difficult to label, owing at least partly to his ability to avoid mudslinging 
debates, preferring instead to resolve disputes behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has a Spartan, conventional life style and is an avid hunter and 
golfer. He and his wife, Marike, have three adopted children, two sons and a 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Conservative Church 
</P>
<P>
He is a member of the Gereformeerde Kerk, the smallest of three Afrikaner 
churches, which is known for its rigidly conservative ideology and relatively 
liberal politics, and he is the first Gereformeerde politician to ascend to the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their political differences, the De Klerk brothers remain close friends 
-- and they still manage to discuss politics frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we have loud arguments," Willem said. "But at the end there's always 
a smile."

N.Y. PHONE STRIKER DIES IN PARKING LOT ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A picketer injured in a confrontation with a non-striking worker who was trying 
to drive into a New York Telephone Co. parking lot died Tuesday, a day on which 
the Communications Workers of America and NYNEX announced that informal talks 
would resume today. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Horgan, 34, died of head and neck injuries at Westchester County Medical 
Center on the 10th day of the strike by 189,000 union employees against four 
"Baby Bell" companies in 20 states and the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Horgan was walking the picket line outside the company office in 
Valhalla, north of New York City, when a car trying to enter the facility 
bumped him, Mt. Pleasant Police Chief Paul Oliva said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Climbs on Hood 
</P>
<P>
Horgan then climbed onto the hood of the car, pounding it with his fists, and 
as the car kept moving the striker slipped from the vehicle and hit the 
pavement, Oliva said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, identified by company spokesman Tony Pappas as Trisha McNamara, 18, 
a non-union summer employee who was not on strike, had not been charged in the 
incident, Oliva said. 
</P>
<P>
The Communication Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers struck Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Telesis telephone 
companies Aug. 6 in a dispute focusing mainly on wages and health benefits. 
About 35,000 employees of Ameritech struck in five Midwestern states Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Atlantic officials said they were waiting for CWA negotiators to review a 
revised company proposal on health benefits offered Monday before scheduling 
further talks this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks Exclude IBEW 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between NYNEX and CWA broke down Aug. 5, the day the contract 
expired. The new talks will not include the IBEW, which represents 20,000 
additional strikers. 
</P>
<P>
CWA officials in Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin said they will 
confer Thursday in Detroit with the union's bargaining committee on their 
strike against Ameritech, union spokesman L. Keith Hooley said. He said no 
negotiating sessions were likely until after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
No new talks between union and management were scheduled at Pacific Telesis, 
serving California and Nevada, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, about 10,000 striking workers marched with civil rights activist 
Jesse Jackson and urged customers to delay paying phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, more than 1,000 striking employees and supporters marched 
outside New Jersey Bell's Newark headquarters Tuesday, blocking traffic and 
chanting slogans. The CWA and the IBEW were joined by small contingents of 
Eastern Airline pilots and members of other unions. 
</P>
<P>
Because of automation, the strike's effect on telephone service has been 
limited, although operator-assisted calls and repair and installation work have 
been affected. 
</P>
<P>
A Bell Atlantic subsidiary is investigating vandalism of long-distance phone 
lines in West Virginia. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. offered a 
$10,000 reward for information regarding vandalism that has knocked out phone 
service, including 911 emergency lines, to thousands of West Virginians. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night vandals cut 11 fiber optic cables between St. Albans and 
Hurricane, shutting off phone service to more than 8,000 customers, said 
C&amp;P spokeswoman Roberta Fowlkes. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Bell has recorded more than 170 acts of vandalism or sabotage since 
July 31, about a week before the strike began, officials said. A cable was 
reported sliced in Gloucester County Monday, cutting off service to about 400 
customers.

N.M. AGENCY GETS STATIC AFTER BEAR SUFFERS 7,200-VOLT JOLT

<P>
A state agency was criticized Tuesday for tranquilizing a black bear atop a 
25-foot utility pole without shutting the power off or using a net to break its 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
To the horror of spectators, the woozy 150-pound bear fell off the pole Monday, 
bounced off a transformer and tumbled to the ground amid a cascade of sparks. 
The bear became tangled in electrical wire as it fell and received a 7,200-volt 
jolt when it hit the transformer, a utility spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The female bear, believed to have wandered into town from the nearby Sandia 
Mountains, was taken to the Rio Grande Zoological Park, where she was doing 
well, officials said. The bear suffered an electrical burn on her right hind 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received quite a bit of calls -- primarily criticism," said Mark 
Birkhauser, a conservation officer with the New Mexico Department of Game and 
Fish. "Public opinion in general seems to think it wasn't handled as well as it 
could have been." 
</P>
<P>
A department officer shot a tranquilizer dart into the bear after it had been 
chased through a residential neighborhood. The bear was believed to have been 
searching for a lost cub. A 6-month-old cub was captured Sunday in a mulberry 
tree in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
The cub, which was being kept separate from the adult bear at the zoo, is fine, 
Birkhauser said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main concerns of callers was that the bear was tranquilized while too high 
on the utility pole and no attempt was made to cushion its fall, and that 
electrical power wasn't shut off before the animal was shot down," Merrilyn 
Segrest, deputy supervisor at the Animal Humane Assn. in Albuquerque, said.

2 HOUSES BURNED, 300 EVACUATED AS MOTHER LODE AREA FIRE CHARS 400 ACRES

<P>
A wildfire that burned two homes near this Mother Lode town grew quickly to 400 
acres Tuesday, causing evacuation of 200 to 300 homes in an area of four square 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Afternoon temperatures were near 100 degrees, and the fire spread fast and 
jumped forward -- or spotted -- with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
But about 350 firefighters, eight aerial tankers and a helicopter appeared to 
be making progress against it as the day ended. They worked in a holding 
pattern to try to protect the small acreage ranches, cabins and plush homes in 
the region as the blaze turned the night sky into a bright orange glow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really slowing the fire down," state Department of Forestry fire boss 
Bob Monsen said shortly before dusk. "The problem is islands of vegetation 
burning out near homes." 
</P>
<P>
Three firefighters were treated for minor injuries. Centers to receive the 
evacuees were set up here and in Railroad Flat. 
</P>
<P>
Monsen said, "We're trying to keep the fire out of the Mokelumne River 
drainage. If it gets down there, we really have a mess." 
</P>
<P>
He said that from the canyon, the fire could move down hill toward Mokelumne 
Hill or up hill toward Glencoe. 
</P>
<P>
Monsen said California 26 and 49 were closed because of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Forestry spokeswoman Annette Shimer said the blaze was burning in 
rolling Calaveras County terrain covered by grass, brush and trees.

BOARD SUGGESTS STUDY OF STATE LAW COVERING ROLE OF ALTERNATE JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of delays in the Night Stalker trial caused by the replacement of 
one juror, who fell asleep during deliberations, and a second juror, who was 
shot to death, Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday called for a study of 
revising state law to allow alternate jurors to attend jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"While the alternates may not take part in the deliberations," said Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich, "they would be up to date on the jury's discussions and would 
be able to immediately participate if their seating becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"This would save time and taxpayers money without impairing a defendant's right 
to a fair trial," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors directed the county Criminal Justice Coordination Committee to 
study the issue.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L-1011 LANDS SAFELY ON 2 ENGINES AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of a Delta Air Lines L-1011 shut down one the craft's engines Tuesday 
and safely landed the jumbo jet at Los Angeles International Airport, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The landing was a scheduled stop for Flight 79 from Atlanta to Honolulu, and 
the problem was believed to be minor, said Delta spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett 
Johnson in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet exactly why the engine was shut down," she said. "But it was 
done as a precaution." 
</P>
<P>
The jet was about 100 miles east of Los Angeles when the pilot advised the 
control tower that he was shutting down the engine under the right wing and 
preparing to land on two engines, said Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman Fred O'Donnell.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORT ORDERED ON LONG WELFARE LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday ordered welfare officials 
to report in two weeks on ways to relieve overcrowding in welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
The action was prompted by complaints from welfare recipients, especially at 
the South-Central Los Angeles office, that they have had to stand for as long 
as six hours in line outside because of crowding inside. The problem grew worse 
last week when fire officials enforced occupancy limits inside offices. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the poor have blamed the crowding on the board's conservative 
majority, which has cut staffing in the Department of Public Social Services. 
But conservative Supervisor Deane Dana said he believes the crowding can be 
reduced by better scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who toured the South-Central office on Monday, said he 
is trying to relocate other county departments that share space in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
On a related matter, Hahn said he will call for an investigation into reports 
that Los Angeles County erroneously paid about $121.5 million to welfare 
recipients during a recent 18-month period. Dana said he was not disturbed by 
Los Angeles County's 4.7% error rate, saying it is lower than that in Eastern 
cities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLUM BUILDING PUT INTO ESCROW PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A slum building in the Westlake district of Los Angeles became the first to be 
placed under a punitive city program that takes rent money away from landlords 
and places it in a special bank account controlled by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to put a 36-unit property at 521 S. 
Union Drive, owned by Peter Berrocal of Mano Industries Inc., in the "rent 
escrow account program." The program was authorized by the council last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to send out a very stern warning to all property owners," said 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who co-authored the ordinance with Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, "that we intend to do business." 
</P>
<P>
The owner can retrieve the money, minus city administrative costs, once repairs 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
The council gave a week's reprieve to a second building at 1041 S. Westlake 
Ave., which was also considered for the program, to give owner Luis Guerrero 
time to complete repairs.

<P>
It never quite reached the mythic proportions of such classic duels as David 
vs. Goliath, St. George vs. the Dragon, or Napoleon vs. Wellington. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, it appears that Vampira vs. Elvira may just fade away into a small 
file in the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Vampira, a 1950s television horror-show priestess, have been 
permitted to withdraw from the case after telling U.S. District Judge William 
M. Byrne Jr. that they haven't been able to contact her for several months to 
proceed with her lawsuit against Cassandra (Elvira) Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Vampira, whose real name is Maila Nurmi, claimed that Elvira, who holds down a 
similar job these days, stole her character. 
</P>
<P>
Elvira cackles that it ain't so. In fact, some say that the model for Vampira 
may have been look-alike Carroll Borland, who accompanied Bela Lugosi on his 
haunting forays in "Mark of the Vampira" in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne gave Nurmi, whose last address was in Hollywood, until Sept. 18 to either 
contact the court or have her $10-million suit dismissed. Efforts by The Times 
to reach Vampira also failed. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne previously threw out Nurmi's claim that Elvira violated Vampira's right 
to publicity, but ruled that Vampira may seek damages for possible trademark 
infringements. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the suit contends that Elvira lifted Vampira's character by 
copying such features as "a distinctive, low-cut, tattered black dress, 
emphasizing cleavage and a voluptuous figure." 
</P>
<P>
If the low-cut rivals do go to court, neither side is expected to call Gloria 
Steinem as a character witness. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers fell short, and the Dodgers are struggling. But one Los Angeles team 
captured a championship: The lifeguards representing the county Beaches and 
Harbors Department swam, ran and paddled to victory in the national competition 
in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Big winner was Diane Graner of Santa Monica, who dominated five events, 
including two triathlon-type "Iron Woman" races. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, reassuring news for Southern California swimmers -- at least, those 
brave enough to enter the often polluted local waters. 
</P>
<P>
Add lunar report: It's somehow fitting that pretrial motions in the case of Zsa 
Zsa Gabor vs. Gorgeous Beverly Hills Cop are scheduled today, the same day that 
a total eclipse of the moon is on the agenda. After all, one of Gabor's title 
film roles was the 1958 classic, "Queen of Outer Space." 
</P>
<P>
The Bixby Land Co. is throwing a big bash at ground-breaking ceremonies for the 
Circle Center West shopping center in Long Beach next week, and honored guests 
won't be served any of those chi-chi edibles that no one can pronounce. 
</P>
<P>
Invitations point out that catering is "courtesy of In-N-Out Burger." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the HOLLYWOOD sign has been chipped away, covered with graffiti 
and altered (HOLLYWEED, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the latest indignity: A sushi attack. 
</P>
<P>
And don't blame Caltech. This painting was fashioned by Bonese Collins Turner, 
an art instructor at Pierce College whose works have been featured in more than 
250 exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
At least, "Sushi Hits Hollywood," described as a commentary on urban life, 
appears to include a couple of California Roll (avec avocado) pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Attention ablutophobes and zoophobes: Your stories are among those told in the 
just published "Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears and Anxieties," co-authored by 
writer Ada Kahn and Ronald M. Doctor, a Cal State Northridge psychology 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn-Doctor offer self-help suggestions for overcoming such fears as washing 
and bathing (ablutophobia) or coming in contact with animals (zoophobia). 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, the next edition will include sushiphobia.

Jason Lea, the 9-year-old Upland boy whose body was found at the base of a 
cliff in the San Gabriel Mountains earlier this month, was killed by "severe 
blows to the chest," authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The blunt force trauma to the chest was the result of an assault. It is being 
listed as a homicide," said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob 
Dambacher. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's investigators did not determine what type of object might have caused 
the injuries, but said the trauma was not caused by a fall off the cliff. An 
undetermined amount of alcohol was also found in the boy's body, but no sign of 
drugs was found, Dambacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives, in whose jurisdiction the boy's body 
was found, said the autopsy report also indicates that the victim received 
injuries both before and after death. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators will submit evidence to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office for possible filing of murder charges once they receive the 
written coroner's report, possibly today, said Deputy Chris Wahla. 
</P>
<P>
Two juveniles, 16 and 17, were initially arrested in connection with the 
disappearance. Lea's nude body then was found Aug. 4 at the bottom of a 
200-foot ravine off Glendora Ridge Road in the Mt. Baldy area. 
</P>
<P>
Later, two other suspects, age 18 and 19, surrendered, and sheriff's homicide 
detectives sought murder complaints against them. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors decided against filing charges against any of the four for 
lack of evidence. They noted that the coroner at the time had not yet ruled on 
the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the original four suspects remain in custody of San Bernardino County 
authorities. The 18 year-old is being held on a probation violation, and one of 
the juveniles remains in custody on an unrelated charge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, memorial services were held for Lea on Tuesday at the 11th Street 
Baptist Church in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who lived with his grandfather, disappeared the night of July 29 after 
going for a bicycle ride. His bicycle was found outside an arcade in Upland.

NATIONAL GUARD COPTER JOINS COUNTY DRUG SURVEILLANCE TEAM

The California National Guard was called into service by the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to provide a helicopter and pilot to assist 
local law enforcement authorities in drug surveillance operations. 
</P>
<P>
The OH-58 chopper is being made available to Los Angeles County at the request 
of Sheriff Sherman Block. It will be used only for observing drug suspects from 
the air, according to an agreement approved by the supervisors, although there 
is a provision in the agreement that allows it to land to assist in 
life-threatening emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, based at the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center in Orange 
County, and its volunteer pilot will be unarmed. A sheriff's deputy who will 
ride along to conduct the surveillance will carry a weapon but is prohibited 
from firing it from the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
A guard helicopter has been assisting the Los Angeles Police Department in drug 
surveillance for nearly a year under a federal program designed to increase 
military involvement in the war against drug trafficking. The federal 
government pays for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a guard helicopter engaged in anti-drug efforts crashed in Imperial 
County, killing five deputies from different parts of Southern California and 
three guardsmen aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has called for deploying military police to ride along 
with local law enforcement officers in combating gang violence on the streets. 
A spokeswoman for Block said the sheriff opposes the idea because the guardsmen 
do not have the proper law enforcement training.

PASTOR CELEBRATES CONTROVERSIAL PAST; 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'S OLDEST CHURCH MARKS 175TH YEAR AS A PARISH BY HELPING POOR, REFUGEES 
</P>

Father Luis Olivares was posing for a photograph in front of the historic La 
Placita Church, the oldest in Los Angeles, and the photographer instructed the 
slouching pastor to "straighten up." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what a lot of people would like him to do," one of his acquaintances 
standing nearby joked. " 'Hey buddy, straighten up.' " 
</P>
<P>
The priest chuckled, knowing that he hardly bends over backward to satisfy 
mainstream public opinion. His church isn't likely to, either. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 200 years, the posture of La Iglesia de la Nuestra Senora la 
Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula has been the same. Founded in 1784, it has 
always offered refuge to the poor and downtrodden. Half a century ago, for 
instance, the church protected Mexican citizens when U.S. authorities ordered 
the massive repatriations of thousands of aliens. 
</P>
<P>
And now, to the outrage of immigration authorities and others, La Placita under 
Olivares has declared itself a place of sanctuary for refugees from Central 
America and the homeless. It is one of two Catholic churches in Los Angeles to 
issue such a declaration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial History 
</P>
<P>
It is this sometimes controversial history that the church marked Tuesday with 
a celebratory Mass, presided over by Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, and a 
reception at the historic Pico House to observe the 175th anniversary of its 
establishment as a parish. A fund-raising dinner and a variety show at 
Disneyland are planned in October as part of the observance. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials hope to use some of the proceeds to rehabilitate part of the 
1,200-seat church's interior. But most of the funds will help purchase a 
building so most of the estimated 200 men who sleep at La Placita each night, 
seeking protection from immigration authorities or just a roof over their 
heads, can have more adequate accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares knows such plans may be unpopular, especially when the neighbors of 
the yet-to-be-selected building find out, but he is unwilling to apologize for 
the celebration or the purpose behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask my critics to put themselves in my position and asked themselves what 
would they do if they . . . had to respond to the presence of desperate people 
in their midst," said the priest, whose activism led him to help establish the 
United Neighborhoods Organization on the Eastside. "Would they not respond 
because it was going to make them unpopular? 
</P>
<P>
"This celebration is not fireworks, rah rah or a band playing. It's a statement 
of everything this church stands for. And yes . . . including those things that 
are controversial." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the church's sometimes controversial stances, some of Los Angeles' 
power brokers have signed on to help out. Civic leader and lawyer Richard J. 
Riordan, for example, hosted a a reception after the celebratory Mass. And 
others have worked quietly behind the scenes to line up contributions for the 
October banquet. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not always agree with Father Olivares, but we need men like him," said 
one corporate executive who declined to have his name publicly connected to the 
celebration. "He keeps jabbing at you, reminding you of all that's really going 
on in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexican TV Personality 
</P>
<P>
Olivares has managed to enlist Mexican television personality Raul Velasco -- 
who normally shuns controversy even though he wields considerable influence 
within the powerful Televisa television conglomerate south of the border. 
Velasco, whose weekly show "Siempre en Domingo" ("Always on Sunday") attracts a 
wide audience throughout Latin America and the United States, has agreed to 
stage the show at Disneyland to benefit La Placita. 
</P>
<P>
"He was impressed with the church when he visited recently," a spokesman for 
Velasco said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. "He decided he wanted 
to help those who help poor Mexicanos in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, who has a framed Christmas card from Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega 
hanging in his office, said La Placita has been an advocate for Latinos long 
before he arrived as pastor in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The church was established three years after the pueblo was founded along the 
banks of the then-named Porciuncula River, as a chapel. An extension of the San 
Gabriel Mission, services were limited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Church Built 
</P>
<P>
Named the Church of Our Lady the Queen of Angels, the tiny chapel faced the 
town plaza and was quickly dubbed La Placita (Little Plaza) by the townspeople. 
But it soon became inadequate and construction of a new church, also near the 
river, began on Aug. 15, 1814. 
</P>
<P>
Although that structure was abandoned after a flood and another building was 
completed in 1822 at the church's current site -- just north of Civic Center on 
Main Street -- archdiocese officials regard the 1814 date as the founding of 
the Los Angeles parish. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials took note of La Placita's importance in the growing pueblo and 
transferred the seat of the diocese from Monterey to the church in 1859. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, La Placita became the gathering place for the town's 
Spanish-speaking Catholics. Historians note that the town's growing 
English-speaking population grew uneasy about attending services there because 
of the pervasive Mexican atmosphere and clamored for a new church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cathedral Shunned 
</P>
<P>
In 1878, the Cathedral of St. Vibiana's, near the present-day intersection of 
Main and 2nd streets, was built as the new headquarters for the diocese. But 
the town's Latino Catholics refused to follow the English-speakers to the new 
cathedral, preferring to worship at the old church. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1930s, during the massive repatriations of Mexican illegals, 
authorities raided the church on several occasions, arresting aliens. Outraged 
priests at the time loudly protested, but most of Los Angeles supported the 
deportations. 
</P>
<P>
Today, because of the sanctuary declaration, immigration agents have been 
declared persona non grata on church grounds. 
</P>
<P>
More uneasiness over the church's role in sanctuary, however, has surfaced in 
recent months over complaints that many of the refugees are, in fact, thieves 
who are responsible for increasing violence and crime. The merchants at nearby 
Olvera Street are particularly concerned because they fear that the situation 
will hurt the venerable tourist spot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Will Support This' 
</P>
<P>
"Father (Olivares) means well and I, like most of Olvera Street, will support 
this 175th anniversary in any way we can," said an Olvera Street merchant who 
asked not to be identified. "But we can't have this crime business go on." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, who has met with the merchants to work out a solution, said he 
understands their concerns. But, he said, there is La Placita's historic 
mission to consider: 
</P>
<P>
"La Placita has always been a refuge for the poor. . . . People may be unhappy 
with me but I've got to act in accordance with what I consider to be my 
responsibility." 
</P>

DOCTOR COMPLAINS POLICE USED MACE ON BOUND PATIENT 
</P>

The chief of the emergency department at UCLA Medical Center said he made a 
complaint Tuesday against a Los Angeles police officer who sprayed Mace in the 
face of a defenseless patient under treatment in the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marshall Morgan of UCLA said he was told by his staff that the patient, 
Jason Standley, 29, was being held at the hospital in four-point leather 
restraints when an officer sprayed Mace into the patient's face at a distance 
of "about four or five inches." 
</P>
<P>
The patient had been brought by officers to the emergency room for treatment 
about 4 a.m. on Friday, after drinking and resisting arrest. Morgan, who said 
he was informed of the incident by doctors and nurses on duty at the time, said 
Standley suffered from face and shoulder lacerations as well as broken teeth. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, medical personnel placed the patient in four-point leather 
restraints typically used to subdue belligerent individuals. An emergency room 
nurse then observed a police officer -- whom she did not identify -- approach 
the patient and spray him with Mace in his eyes, face, nose and mouth. As the 
Mace dispersed, Morgan said emergency room personnel began complaining of 
burning eyes and other irritations. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Steve Osti at the West Los Angeles station said that Standley was 
arrested and booked on Aug. 11 on charges of assaulting a police officer with a 
deadly weapon. The weapon, he said, was a loose handcuff. 
</P>
<P>
Osti said the trouble began when Standley, who is employed at a fast-food 
restaurant, got drunk and began harassing two people on a West Los Angeles 
street. He said police officers had to use their batons to subdue and arrest 
Standley. 
</P>
<P>
They then took him for medical care to UCLA, where he became combative when the 
officers removed his handcuffs. Osti confirmed that officers used Mace on 
Standley in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Douglas Pilot, acting commanding officer of the West Los Angeles police 
station, acknowledged that Morgan called Tuesday to complain about the Mace 
incident. Pilot said the Mace was used only after Standley freed one leg from 
his restraints and kicked over a food tray. He said he is satisfied that his 
officers acted properly.

Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong's teeming detention centers are threatened by 
malnutrition and disease, the top U.N. refugee official in the colony said. 
Robert van Leeuwen called for better food and "a massive immunization campaign" 
for "boat people" being housed on an outlying island and on five ferries in 
Hong Kong's harbor. Van Leeuwen based his statements on a preliminary report by 
U.N. officials about camps housing 6,700 of Hong Kong's 51,000 refugees. 
Convinced that their quest for a new life is over, 124 of the refugees have 
volunteered to return to their homeland.

At least 20 people were injured in a clash between supporters of rival 
political parties in the central Mexican city of Morelia, police said. A 
spokesman said three of the 20 were seriously hurt in the clash between 
followers of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the opposition 
center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. The clash took place as an 
electoral college began meeting to ratify the results of local elections held 
July 2 in Michoacan state, of which Morelia is the capital. The opposition 
disputes official results given so far, which indicate the ruling party won 
with 12 of 18 electoral districts.

The state's Fair Political Practices Commission agreed that San Francisco Mayor 
Art Agnos should pay a $7,000 fine for failing to disclose $441,521 in real 
estate income while a state legislator. The fine also covered Agnos' failure to 
disclose the source of a political mailing. The five-member commission voted 
unanimously to accept a settlement negotiated by Agnos and the commission 
staff. Agnos admitted failure to disclose the property transactions while he 
was an assemblyman, as required by law. Last September, he used stationery from 
the mayor's office, rather than from a campaign committee, for letters 
supporting the stationing of the battleship Missouri in San Francisco.

A tax court held that Arizona must reimburse about 72,000 retirees for state 
income taxes they paid on their federal pensions. Judge William Moroney cited a 
U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year, in which Michigan was told it 
could not tax federal retirees unless it also taxed state, county and local 
government pensioners. Craig Corimier, a deputy director in Arizona's 
Department of Revenue, had warned that such a ruling could be "financially 
devastating" because it could cost the state as much as $210 million. He said 
the revenue agency had not yet decided whether to appeal the decision.

At least 77 people were injured in rioting and disturbances on the 42nd 
anniversary of India's independence, and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi warned 
that divisive forces are rising in the country. Bomb blasts and rioting struck 
the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, with at least 50 people injured, while 
police opened fire and lobbed tear-gas shells to quell riots in Calcutta, 
Indian news agencies reported. In Srinagar, summer capital of predominantly 
Muslim Kashmir, there were sporadic outbursts of violence after separatists 
called for a 24-hour general strike.

Shops and offices closed in much of Sri Lanka and transportation ground to a 
virtual halt in a strike called on Indian Independence Day by Sinhalese 
radicals to protest the presence of Indian troops, officials said. There were 
no immediate reports of violence. President Ranasinghe Premadasa said a plan 
proposed by India for a phased pullout of Indian soldiers from the island's 
northeast section needs "further revision," as "no room should be left for the 
slightest undermining of the sovereignty of Sri Lanka." India and Sri Lanka 
have been embroiled in a dispute over the withdrawal of an Indian peacekeeping 
force that was deployed to enforce a 1987 accord to end a war by separatists of 
the island's Tamil minority.

In what authorities called the worst night of subway violence in memory, 
altercations in three New York City stations left three men dead in less than 
four hours. A Brooklyn man on his way home was stabbed several times in a 
station there and died in a hospital within an hour. Police said he apparently 
had been robbed. Later, in another Brooklyn station, two men argued on a 
platform and one shot the other to death. In Manhattan, one of two would-be 
robbers in a Times Square station was stabbed to death, allegedly by the 
intended victim. "This was really a mind-boggling night," Al O'Leary of the 
Transit Authority said.

New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo tried and failed Tuesday to change the federal 
mind and win presidential approval for his plan to dismantle a new nuclear 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything was done to change the governor's mind. I don't think 
anything was done to change the President's mind," Deputy Energy Secretary W. 
Henson Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, Moore, White House chief of staff John H. Sununu and Bush aide 
Andrew Card met with Cuomo for nearly an hour Tuesday after Cuomo said he 
wanted to see the President personally to make his case for dismantling, rather 
than mothballing, the Shoreham plant 50 miles east of New York City on Long 
Island's northern shore. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department argues that Shoreham is needed to ease possible power 
shortages in the Northeast.

A Chinese passenger plane faltered during takeoff Tuesday and plunged into a 
river near the Shanghai airport, killing 18 people, the official New China news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Television news said the Antonov-24, a twin turboprop of Soviet design, carried 
32 passengers and eight crew members. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said rescuers were trying to extricate survivors from the 
wreckage near Hongqiao airport, 12 miles north of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted witnesses as saying the plane seemed to go out of 
control as it became airborne, then plunged into the river about 100 yards from 
the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 5510 of China Eastern Airlines, a subsidiary of the national Civil 
Aviation Administration of China, was bound for Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi 
province in southern China, about 400 miles southwest of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Chinese air accident since August, 1988, when a flight from 
Canton crashed while landing at Hong Kong, killing seven people. 
</P>
<P>
Five major crashes, which killed 172 people, were reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hu Yizhou, head of the national airline, said early this year there were 
"serious problems" with safety and called for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The worst death toll last year was in a crash near Chongqing in the southwest 
that killed all 108 people on the aircraft.

BENNETT NOTES DRUG LEGACY OF WOODSTOCK

Drug policy director William J. Bennett complained Tuesday about the "memory 
distortion" in the nostalgia that has welled up around the 20th anniversary of 
the Woodstock festival. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Bennett, a one-time guitar player and fan of early rock 'n' 
roll, recited what he called a "casualty list from Woodstock" of rock 
performers, including singer Janis Joplin, who died in later years from drug 
overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who as a graduate student at the University of Texas in the late 1960s 
had a blind date with Joplin, said "part of the legacy of Woodstock was 
tolerance of drugs, and let us be glad that is over, rather than wishing it 
were back. We do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come 
too far."

FOR DETROIT TIGERS, THIS ONE HAS BEEN AN ENDLESS SUMMER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sparky Anderson's season is captured in a needlepoint picture that hangs from 
the wall of his office. 
</P>
<P>
A tiger's head droops beneath the folksy phrase: "Leave Me Alone -- I'm Having 
A Crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Tigers are last in the American League East with the worst record 
in baseball. They struggle to make a necessary transition, finding rookies to 
replace the men who helped the team to 11 consecutive winning seasons. The 
strain of this summer shows on the face of the manager. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a man unaccustomed to losing, admits this is the most difficult year 
of his career. He is the 10th-winningest manager in major-league history with 
1,742 victories. His goal is to climb to fifth on the all-time list, ahead of 
Walter Alston's 2,040 wins, but he says, "At this rate, I might be older than 
Moses by the time I get there." 
</P>
<P>
Lighthearted moments are rare. This is a season for brooding. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the same fire," Anderson says. "But you have to face facts when you're 
in last place. I work harder now trying to win a game." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, he sat in his office underneath the third-base box seats at Tiger 
Stadium, preparing for that night's game against the Baltimore Orioles. He 
puffed on his pipe and discussed the changes in his life brought on by this 
season of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Losing caused sleepless nights. Sleepless nights caused exhaustion. And for 2 
1/2 weeks in May and early June, Anderson stayed home, under doctor's orders. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in 20 years that I've been in last place," Anderson 
says. "I can't think of anything worse in our game. But the game is one thing, 
and life is another. The game doesn't mean anything in comparison to real 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson no longer accepts speaking invitations or grants every interview 
request. He is delegating his time, ordering room service and taking daily 
one-hour walks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always put the real things ahead of baseball," Anderson says. "I never 
thought that baseball was the thing. I've been very fortunate. But I never 
thought of myself as some VIP. My God, I've had people come up to me and just 
want to touch me. I can't imagine that." 
</P>
<P>
But he won't walk away from baseball. Asked if he will return next season, 
Anderson quickly states: "God, Yes." 
</P>
<P>
He warms to the subject of the Tigers' future, even while dissecting their 
present predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of making a complete overhaul," he says. "The last 10 
years we've put one player from our farm system on the field every day -- 
that's Kirk Gibson (now with the Los Angeles Dodgers). We've had the stopgap 
and stopgap and stopgap. It finally catches up with you." 
</P>
<P>
This is the season everything went wrong for the Tigers. Fifteen players went 
on the disabled list. Trades backfired. The pitching collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating and disappointing," said shortstop Alan Trammell. "But don't 
make it sound like hell. After 11 successful seasons, we're going through one 
that is not that fun. We hope we can win a few games, play good ball. It's not 
drudgery. It's not life or death. But this kind of season won't happen again. 
The injuries. Sparky leaving. The fact we haven't jelled. That just won't 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Chet Lemon says it will take time for younger players to learn their 
roles on a new Tigers team. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken success for granted," he says. "We used to have guys who knew how 
to play the game. Everyone in the lineup knew how to win and knew their roles. 
For the most part, these new guys have the ability, but they're still learning. 
And eventually, they will learn. But now, we have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
Lemon says Anderson provides stability and continuity as the Tigers undergo a 
makeover. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the game can take such a toll on you," Lemon says. "Sparky is so 
energetic now. We're happy to have him back. He's the same as he always was. 
But next year, you'll see a tremendous change on this team, period. You'll see 
a different Detroit Tigers." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is looking forward to next season. Unfortunately for him, he has to 
finish this one. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part of this is that October 2 doesn't get here quick enough," he 
says. "Once that day comes, it's all over. You go home the same as everyone 
else. I've said all along that once the World Series is over, no one cares. No 
one ever remembers the next spring who was second." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers could help determine the winner of the American League East, but 
Anderson loathes playing the role of spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor to play this game," he says. "On the last day of the season, our 
best team will play. I've never made a joke out of this game. If only one fan 
pays to see a game, they deserve to see the best. Spoiler leaves a bad taste in 
my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson hasn't soured on baseball. He loves the game, and enjoys the 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports are not reality," he says. "Reality is something we do every single 
game. In sports, we have a six-month season and then we're off for six months. 
Reality is if you have heart trouble, cancer, diabetes. You've got that for the 
rest of your life. Baseball only lasts a season."

MCCALLUM IS MAKING HIS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday was to be a big afternoon for Napoleon McCallum. It was Military Day at 
Jack Murphy Stadium. The turnout of uniformed men, in this military town, was 
heavy. And when McCallum, a Navy man, caught a two-yard pass in the fourth 
quarter of the San Diego Chargers' pre-season game against the Cowboys, an 
ovation was the result. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first football game for McCallum since December 1986, the end of his 
rookie year with the Los Angeles Raiders. And for this return to action, 
McCallum was grateful, but not overjoyed. That measly two-yard reception was 
the start of his new career as a Charger, but it also was his only play the 
entire game. 
</P>
<P>
New coach Dan Henning had planned for McCallum to play more, but much of the 
running game was scrapped when the Chargers fell way behind early. "I was 
hoping to play a lot more," McCallum said, "but (Henning) said things didn't go 
as he expected. We were behind, and I'm not in the passing game as much." 
</P>
<P>
Still, McCallum has dealt with much larger disappointments than this and he is 
characteristically upbeat about shaking off the layers of rust formed from two 
years of football inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes he can help the Chargers out of the doldrums as he takes on the 
new job of Navy recruiter that apparently will allow him to play football while 
he is serving the remainder of his five-year commitment to the Navy. "This is a 
Navy town, a lot of the Chargers fans are military people and I feel this is 
going to be just great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To recap a bit, McCallum -- the leading rusher in Naval Academy history -- was 
drafted by the Raiders in the fourth round of 1986. John Lehman, secretary of 
the Navy at the time, allowed McCallum to play for the Raiders while being 
stationed on the USS Peleliu, in Long Beach. Despite rigorous duties, he 
commuted to the Raiders and rushed for 536 yards as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
But the following spring, new secretary James Webb, who had other ideas about 
what uniform a Navy man should be wearing, interrupted McCallum's career by 
sending him to the USS California. Commuting was out, since the California, a 
guided-missile cruiser based near Oakland, would be on duty in the Pacific and 
Indian oceans during the football season. 
</P>
<P>
In fact while the California was somewhere near the Philippines, his wife Karen 
sent a telegram that began, "Hi Honey. You've been traded to the San Diego 
Chargers." 
</P>
<P>
William Ball, the man who succeeded Webb, and the Navy brass approved 
McCallum's request to work as a recruiter in San Diego and play for the 
Chargers in his "off-duty hours," as long as football doesn't conflict with his 
Navy duties. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum -- committed to the Navy until the end of 1990 -- will end his current 
leave at the end of pre-season training camp, begin recruiting work at the San 
Diego Navy Recruiting District, Naval Training Center, Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum has been saying for years, ever since his undergraduate days, that he 
and highly visible officer-athletes such as David Robinson and former running 
back Eddie Myers could demonstrate great value to the Navy by being full-time 
recruiters while playing professionally. "But at the time when the decision was 
made not to do it," he said, "those people (in charge) had different goals and 
objectives. ... I'm just real happy to be able to do this again, and so soon." 
</P>
<P>
There were certainly a lot of times when McCallum wondered about whether he 
would get the chance before the five years was up, and whether he should even 
wait it out. Many days McCallum would run around the ship as part of his 
workout and shipmates would cheer, knowing how much he appreciated the support. 
But other days McCallum said he would ask himself: "Why am I going through all 
this? What's the point?" 
</P>
<P>
Few if any of the crew members on the California doubted McCallum would endure, 
the way he pushed himself to make it work that season with the Raiders. They 
knew he had to be close to exhaustion all the time from working two jobs and 
commuting a minimum of two hours a day. They admired the way he pushed himself 
to stay in NFL shape when he didn't know whether there was an NFL future. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the future is here, it's also complicated. At McCallum's position, 
which the Chargers simply call "running back," seven players are listed on the 
depth chart. That does not include Gary Anderson, last season's rushing leader, 
who is a contract holdout. So McCallum is one of eight players competing for 
playing time, not to mention a limited number of roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing could be working in McCallum's favor, something over which he has 
no control. McCallum came to the Chargers with tackle John Clay in exchange for 
Jim Lachey (now of the Washington Redskins) in a trade for which Chargers 
director of operations Steve Ortmayer has taken criticism. While Lachey has 
been to the Pro Bowl and is a Redskins starter, Clay (who had been previously 
injured) has been waived. McCallum not making the team would make the trade a 
disaster for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, just recovering from a hamstring injury, knows he is a player who 
thrives on a heavy workload. "At the academy," he said, "I got a lot of 
repetition and carries. The more reps I got, the better. In this situation, 
you're under pressure because you don't have the luxury of getting a lot of 
reps. In a pre-season game or a scrimmage, you might get one chance -- as I did 
today -- and that's it.

PEETE IS THE FANS' CHOICE AS LIONS' QUARTERBACK 
</P>

<P>
Rodney Peete clearly is the fans' choice as he battles to become the Detroit 
Lions' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
But until he's Coach Wayne Fontes' choice, Peete isn't taking anything for 
granted despite a strong performance in the preseason opener, a 25-24 loss to 
Cleveland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In his pro debut against the Browns, Peete completed 11 of 23 passes for 155 
yards, one touchdown and one interception as the Lions unveiled their stretch 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
He also drew the loudest cheers during pregame introductions and left the field 
to a standing ovation at halftime after throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass with 
one second left in the half to give Detroit a 17-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
When Peete was replaced at quarterback by Bob Gagliano in the second half, the 
fans repeatedly chanted for his return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you feel good, it really does," Peete said Monday at the Lions' 
Oakland University training camp. "But the thing you have to do is keep it in 
perspective. ... 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm just trying to get experience. As far as looking down the line 
and saying I'm going to be the guy, you'd have to ask Coach Fontes." 
</P>
<P>
Fontes won't come out and say that Peete, who surprisingly lasted until the 
sixth round of the NFL draft, will be his starter, but there are several signs 
that Peete is the leading candidate. Originally, Peete was supposed to sit out 
this week's game with Cincinnati. Now, Fontes says he'll play and may even 
start against the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
And since Fontes said he wants to have a starting quarterback in mind before 
the third preseason game, Peete would seem like the logical choice if he ends 
up starting the first two exhibition outings. 
</P>
<P>
Fontes said he continues to be impressed with Peete, both on the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
"For a rookie, I thought he was brilliant out there," Fontes said. "I hate to 
put that much pressure on the young man but he played very well. It was a heck 
of a performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney is the type of young man that all the hype and publicity won't bother 
him at all. He knows it comes with the position. He can handle it. He won't get 
cocky and think he has all the answers at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Peete started slowly against Cleveland after leading Detroit to first downs on 
their first two plays from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
He fumbled later in the Lions' possession and Cleveland kicked a field goal, 
fumbled into the end zone for a Cleveland safety on the next possession, and 
then had an interception returned 73 yards for a TD in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Peete settled down late in the second quarter, when he passed for 141 yards 
as Detroit scored 17 points. The Lions finished with 438 yards offense, more 
than they had in any regular-season game last year. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start, it seemed like everything was going so fast," Peete said. "I 
just had to get the first few series out of my system. You have to remember 
that this the same game as in college, it's just on a different level. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of players come in and try to put a lot of pressure on themselves. This 
is the NFL and that puts them in awe. I feel this was a step forward for me 
whether I played well or things went totally bad. I just wanted to get a chance 
to play."

Sara Lee Corp.: The Chicago-based food and personal products conglomerate 
reported 1989 profit of $410.5 million, up 26% over the previous year. Sales 
totaled $11.7 billion, up 12%. The results reflected strong performances by the 
hosiery and underwear companies in its personal-products division and a pretax 
gain of approximately $87 million from the sale of its Hollywood Brands, Lyon's 
and Peck Foods subsidiaries. Earnings also were affected by a $55-million 
charge for restructuring of the U.S. food operations.

Magnetek Inc.: The electrical equipment maker reported that operating income 
before interest, taxes and extraordinary expenses increased 7% to $89.3 million 
for fiscal 1989, compared to the previous year. The Los Angeles-based firm's 
net income declined 6% to $18.3 million. The company attributed the decline to 
generally higher interest rates and a $2.5-million extraordinary charge related 
to early retirement of debt.

Responding to performers' concerns heightened by the murder of actress Rebecca 
Schaeffer last month, the California section of the Screen Actors Guild 
National Board of Directors has voted unanimously to support proposed state 
legislation that would make it harder to obtain private home addresses from the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. SAG president Barry Gordon and guild executives 
met with Assembly Speaker Pro-Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). Roos, who proposed 
the legislation, will introduce the bill after the Assembly convenes on 
Monday.The bill would allow any citizen to file a request from home-address 
confidentiality with the DMV, which currently provides addresses to the public 
for a nominal fee. Only law enforcement officials would have access to the 
addresses. Claudia Puig

UCI'S NEW A-PLUS GRADE TO ACCENTUATE POSITIVE PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine biologist Howard Lenhoff rewards his most outstanding students with 
"lollipop-A's" a mark of A, accompanied by a lollipop, the offer of a mentor 
relationship and a letter of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"These are my select students," said Lenhoff, who is chairman of UCI's Academic 
Senate. "I want to reward their performance and give them an honor to work 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this fall, however, Lenhoff and other UCI instructors will have a new 
grade option to distinguish the truly exceptional students from the merely very 
good. An A-plus will top the grade scale, but the question of what sets an A 
student apart from an A-plus performer will be left to each instructor. 
</P>
<P>
The new grade, recently approved by the Senate's Academic Council, is to be 
used infrequently, to note extraordinary performance. Although the superlative 
will carry no additional grade points, it is likely to provide top students 
with a valuable edge in the competition for jobs, graduate school admission and 
fellowships. 
</P>
<P>
"It is something that is recorded on a student's transcript that says, 'This 
student is really superior,' " Lenhoff said. "It allows us to give students a 
pat on the back that lasts." 
</P>
<P>
Lenhoff, who estimated that in a lecture class of 400 he might award a handful 
of A-plus marks, is among many UCI academics who welcome a way to reward 
stand-out ability. Others, though, caution that increasing the level of 
recognition risks grade inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when you get such an extraordinary piece of work that you 
don't feel that any of the grades in the normal range can do it justice," said 
Murray Krieger, a distinguished professor and director of the UC Humanities 
Research Institute at UCI. "Anyone who has been blessed by having such a 
student would feel frustration at not being able to give a special mark of 
excellence beyond excellence." 
</P>
<P>
Krieger, who said he has used A-pluses to reward undergraduate and graduate 
papers so good that they were worthy of professional publication, opposes use 
of the new grade to rate an entire quarter of effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The A-plus really confesses that there are too many A's around, and how are we 
going to tell who is really good?" Krieger asked. "Is there no one on the 
faculty who would abuse this? Of course there are some." 
</P>
<P>
University faculty members, who traditionally enjoy great independence to set 
grades, will be free to choose whether and when to award A-pluses. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never use it," said Harold Moore, dean of the School of Biological 
Sciences. The college, considered one of the toughest at UCI, counts nearly a 
quarter of all undergraduates as majors. 
</P>
<P>
"We grade pretty hard in this school, and that generally means that 10% of a 
class might get an A. In my 24 years of experience, I have not seen someone who 
is so far above the top that they would merit an A-plus. It's basically 
cosmetic. It doesn't carry any value. And I think it would lower the value of 
an A." 
</P>
<P>
Political science professor Mark Petracca, who has from 400 to 600 students, 
said he would be likely to award an A-plus "once or twice a year." Unless an 
instructor includes the A-plus on a strict distribution curve, guaranteeing 
that a certain percentage of students in each class will get the highest mark 
regardless of actual performance, the mark is not likely to proliferate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The A-plus possesses a mystical quality that suggests even if you were grading 
on a curve, you would use it infrequently," he said. "If you use it to give 
students a symbolic reward, without additional grade points, you won't inflate 
the GPA." 
</P>
<P>
The roots of the new grade policy date back more than a decade, when the 
faculty senate sought to make grades more precise. The university's 
curriculum-setting body inserted plus and minus grades into the straightforward 
scale of A, B, C, D and F, but did not provide for an A-plus. The result was a 
new numerical grade point that set the value of an A, at the top of the scale, 
at 4.0 and C, in the middle, at 2.0. The new C-minus was worth 1.8 and was no 
longer considered a passing grade. 
</P>
<P>
"It became punitive," Lenhoff said. "A student who would have gotten a C now 
gets a C-minus and no longer passes the course. If we are going to balance the 
scale, those who do much better than the average A should get a plus. It's 
logical." 
</P>
<P>
Lenhoff advocates making the top reward even sweeter. Eventually, he would like 
to see an A-plus grade worth 4.2 for grade-point purposes. The idea is not 
radical; Johns Hopkins University allows a grade of H -- for honor -- worth 5.0 
on a scale that ordinarily goes only to A, or 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
In the UC system, four other campuses allow A-plus grades, but, like UCI, limit 
grade-point credit to 4.0. Now that A-plus is part of the grading repertoire at 
UCI, the debate will turn next to the issue of weighting that mark, Lenhoff 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that would inflate grades," he said. "It would reward rare 
performance."

CALL-BOX DISPATCHERS FACE TANGLE OF TONGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's year-old system of freeway telephones has a problem -- the 
dispatchers at California Highway Patrol headquarters in Santa Ana can't 
understand many of the callers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,134 call boxes spaced every quarter of a mile along all the county's 
freeways received a record 13,500 calls last month. About 10% of the callers, 
as many as 100 on some days, spoke only foreign languages, mostly Spanish and 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatchers, however, speak only English. 
</P>
<P>
"From the start, the number of people calling in foreign languages has 
surprised us," said Todd Murphy, chairman of California SAFE (Service Authority 
for Freeway Emergencies), which handles wireless call boxes in California. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that when the telephone service was launched last September, 
officials expected to receive some calls in Spanish but never anticipated the 
volume and diversity of foreign language calls. 
</P>
<P>
A translation center was retained to deal with non-English-speaking callers. 
When foreign language calls come into Santa Ana, the caller is patched into the 
translation facility -- Communications and Language Line, based in Monterey, 
Calif. -- and a three-way conversation takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say they receive more demands for translation from Orange 
County than anywhere else freeway phones are used. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very start we found that Orange County runs 30 to 40 different 
languages every month, about the same as in New York City," said Mike McFerrin, 
information manager for Communications and Language Line, which can translate 
in 143 languages. "We get more calls from call boxes in Orange County than we 
do from anywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Although the center has had to deal with Orange County callers who speak only 
such languages as Romanian and Farsi, about half the foreign language calls are 
in Spanish. While they can still hook up by telephone with the translation 
service, Highway Patrol officials say they need Spanish speakers on staff to 
handle the 
</P>
<P>
heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
"The translation service is great, but it's costly and slower than having 
somebody on hand," said Lt. Rick Criner, manager of the Santa Ana 
communications center. "We need somebody on staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much better to have bilingual people on hand rather than to try and sort 
things out over three telephone lines. They are faster and they can save lives 
if they know CHP policies and procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Criner said the telephone center has had difficulty attracting Spanish-speaking 
applicants and that CHP regulations have hampered the hiring of Spanish 
speakers. Under department rules, bilingual dispatchers can be paid more after 
they are hired but can only be given preference in hiring if they are among the 
top three candidates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the CHP allocated extra money to be paid to two Spanish-speaking 
dispatchers in the Santa Ana office, but so far none has been hired. In June, 
the department held its first ever bilingual test for dispatchers. Of 20 
applicants, four qualified and have been listed for hire, said CHP spokesman 
Keith Thornhill. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County began to install the call-box system in 1987 after the area's 26 
municipalities approved a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle registration to pay for 
it. About $5.4 million was spent just to install the telephones that went on 
line in June, 1988, and were completed last September. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other counties in California will be watching to see how Orange 
County deals with the problem. Although only Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles 
counties now have call boxes, more than a dozen other counties, including 
Riverside, expect to start the service in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
By 1991, though, there should be 15,000 call boxes in the state, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"This system is the best we can do for now," said Murphy. "It helps drivers 
help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COUNTY CALL BOXES 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County call box system was the first in the state to begin operation 
under the California SAFE (Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies) program 
last June. Since then, California Highway Patrol authorities in Santa Ana have 
found that about 10% of the 8,000 to 13,000 calls each month are in languages 
operators can't understand without a translator. 
</P>
<P>
Total call boxes in O.C.: 1,124 
</P>
<P>
Calls per week: about 2,000 
</P>
<P>
Cost to build: $5.2 million 
</P>
<P>
Total calls requiring a translator in June: 828 
</P>
<P>
Average number of languages other than English each month: 30-40 
</P>
<P>
Full-time positions for answering call-box calls: 6

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
D.A. DECLINES TO CHARGE MAN WHO SHOT PROWLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office has decided not to charge an Anaheim man who 
fatally shot a teen-age prowler on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Melvin L. Jensen announced Tuesday that he found no evidence 
to justify filing charges against Larry Sampson, who has admitted killing 
17-year-old Sangbonn Bunleuth of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson had been awakened in the middle of the night by sounds on the roof of 
his Marion Way home, Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said. A short time later, 
Sampson heard someone trying to enter the house through a sliding glass door. 
</P>
<P>
"The door was being rattled," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson called police, who responded with a helicopter and at least two squad 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
But 10 minutes after the helicopter and squad cars left, Barry said, Sampson 
heard more noises in the darkened back yard. Rushing out, he spotted someone 
climbing over the fence into the front yard of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson ordered the man to stop, but the man turned toward him, Sampson told 
police. Sampson fired one shot. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said police decided not to arrest Sampson, although no weapon was found 
on Bunleuth, who died on the sidewalk in front. 
</P>
<P>
"In a situation like this, it was apparent that Mr. Sampson was not a danger to 
the community," Barry said.

FENCE ON BEACH MUST GO, SAYS LAGUNA CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to press for the 
removal of a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire that restricts access to 
Totuava Bay beach to residents of a condominium complex on the north side of 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution directs the city manager to work with the Laguna Lido Homeowners 
Assn. to knock down what some nearby residents call a dangerous eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
"We're off in the right direction," Michael McDaniel, president of the Sea 
Cliff Drive Homeowners Assn., which petitioned the city to intervene, said 
after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A standing-room-only crowd packed the council chambers to show support for 
removing the 10-foot-high fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw the fence, I couldn't believe this was Laguna Beach," 
resident Pat Paddock told the City Council. "I think it's elitism." 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the Laguna Lido Condominiums in South Laguna are concerned that if 
they fail to maintain the 40-year-old fence as stipulated in their leases, they 
will lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the fence as much as the next person," said Dolores DeMarco, a 
Laguna Lido resident who spoke during the meeting. "But I don't want to lose my 
home because of this." 
</P>
<P>
The 99-year lease is up for renewal next year, DeMarco said, and action on the 
fence might jeopardize title rights to 48 condominiums ranging in market value 
from $275,000 to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want us to take the fence down, and they have the written permission 
of the owner, then it's OK," DeMarco said after the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, reading from the Laguna Lido association's lease, said the fence must 
be maintained unless it violates the law; he and other area residents allege 
that the fence violates state and local laws prohibiting fencing of any 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The fence, which residents said is dangerous to children playing nearby, was 
built to preserve the beach as a private enclave for condominium residents and 
their guests. In a case that was decided by the California Supreme Court, the 
boundary lines were defined in the 1930s. Later, the owner of the land erected 
the chain-link fence from atop a bluff down to rocks extending into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The council, after listening to testimony Tuesday night, agreed that questions 
of legality need to be researched before more specific action can be taken. For 
instance, the city hasn't been able to find that a permit was ever granted for 
the fence, Councilwoman Martha Collison said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, council members agreed that the fence must go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the ugliest things you'll ever see on a beachfront," said 
Councilman Dan Kenney. "If there's some way we can effect the removal of the 
fence, I'm all for it."

TRAGEDY AND PROTEST BY PARENTS LEAD TO A NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spurred by the outcry of angry parents, a developer has begun installing a 
traffic signal at an El Toro Road intersection where a 6-year-old boy died in a 
collision last month. 
</P>
<P>
Residents had urged county officials for months to force installation of a 
stoplight at the busy intersection. On July 28, Andy Dao was killed when a 
pickup truck hit the car he was riding in broadsideas it was crossing El Toro 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Co., an Irvine developer, citing a delay in the delivery of power 
poles, had earlier estimated that the signal would be in place by early 
November. But county traffic engineers were able to find a company that could 
supply the poles within the next few weeks, according to Ignacio Ochoa, a 
county traffic engineer. Installation should be completed within three weeks, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 parents and children gathered last week at a park near the 
intersection to remember Andy and organize a petition drive to pressure the 
county and the developer into quick action. Neighbors said they were relieved 
to see construction start this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very angry and very mad that it took this long," said Phuong Dao, mother 
of the dead boy. "If they put it in earlier, my boy might be alive. I miss my 
little boy very much." 
</P>
<P>
Other neighbors said they were relieved to see construction start this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors' Pressure 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely happy," said Alan Leingang, who lives on the same street as the 
Dao family. He said the early start was due to pressure on the county and 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people put it down, saying it would get installed eventually," 
Leingang said. "If things could happen without people dying, it would be 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Judge, who lives on the same street, said that although she was pleased 
to see the construction, it still can't make up for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good for all of us, but it doesn't bring Andy back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge said a petition bearing 530 signatures will still be delivered to county 
officials to underscore the seriousness of residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting to see if they will follow through," she said. "We've had a lot 
of empty promises." 
</P>
<P>
The developer had agreed to install the stoplight as part of a contract with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have said that the Baldwin Co. was supposed to have the light 
installed by March 30. But Baldwin officials said they were delayed because the 
county's Environmental Management Agency dragged its feet in approving the 
developer's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Although county engineer Ochoa said he wished that the light had been installed 
earlier, he recognized that delays are sometimes unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an improvement I'm happy about," he said. "A traffic signal can't be 
constructed overnight. Some of the projects just tend to go longer." 
</P>
<P>
The county had urged the Baldwin Co. to "expedite the situation" after Andy was 
killed, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, the incident that happened was a catalyst to get them going," Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stop Signs 
</P>
<P>
Andy was riding in a car driven by a family friend, Phung Nguyen, 16, of Lake 
Forest. Phung had taken Andy and Phung's brother, Hanh, 9, and sister, 
Christina, 11, to the beach. She was returning Andy to his parent's home on 
Vintage Way just off the Normandale Drive intersection. 
</P>
<P>
There are stop signs at the intersection on Normandale but none on El Toro 
Road, a six-lane thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Phung drove east on Normandale, stopped at the sign, then tried to cross El 
Toro. She got across the first three lanes, but was then struck by the pickup 
truck. The truck's driver, who was uninjured, was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
Andy died of multiple injuries. Phung suffered a broken right shoulder and 
cuts, while Christina suffered a spleen injury and Hanh received head injuries.

'WE JUST CRUISED' IN 2-DAY PADDLE; 
</P>
<P>
5 BRAVE CURRENT, SHARK TO CATALINA, THEN BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Four state lifeguards and a surfer battled tough currents and a shark visit 
during their two-day charity paddle to Santa Catalina Island and back but came 
ashore at Newport Beach on Tuesday afternoon looking barely winded. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sore, but we're not wiped out. We didn't rush it, we just cruised," 
Steve Hawkins, 27, of Tustin, said after twice crossing the 26-mile channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, let's go get something to eat and some cold beer," said Kris Emery, 27, 
of Newport Beach, the barrel-chested leader of the group, as he left the water 
near the Balboa Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of the trip was longer than expected, as a navigational error 
took the group off course to the north. Then very strong currents off Avalon 
forced the group to take a boat the last six miles. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day, everything was going against us: the tide, the surf, the 
currents. It was a nightmare," Emery said. "We didn't know where we were. We 
got lost." 
</P>
<P>
"Next year," Hawkins said, "we're going to have an on-board navigation 
computer." 
</P>
<P>
When the group -- which was made up of two lifeguards stationed at Crystal Cove 
and two at Huntington State Beach, plus a surfer from San Clemente -- finally 
got within sight of Avalon, the current became so strong that for two hours 
they could make no headway on their 12-foot paddle boards. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit a current that was just hellacious," Hawkins said. "We'd stop paddling, 
and the island would disappear as the current pushed us back." 
</P>
<P>
To top off a rough day at sea, the boat taking them into Avalon ran out of gas 
500 yards from port, so the group had to paddle in for help. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, paddling on their stomachs and knees, with the winds and the swells in 
their favor, the group was having a much easier time -- until they sighted a 
hammerhead shark. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said: "The shark was 15 to 20 yards away. . . . It was close enough." 
</P>
<P>
The group brought their boards together. Each of them lay flat for 20 minutes, 
then quietly paddled away, Hawkins said. The support boat had left them earlier 
when they sighted Newport Beach's Fashion Island towers from 14 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit of a boost when you see a shark," said Dane DeBoer, 25, of 
Newport Beach, a triathlete who had never before paddled long distances. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure it will be a year before I do this again," DeBoer said. 
</P>
<P>
The group -- which also included Joe Long, 24, the San Clemente surfer, and 
Beau McCraney, 18 -- raised about $1,000 in pledges for the Orange County Youth 
Awareness Program, a group that helps underprivileged and abused children, 
Hawkins said.

BIG TREE TAKES TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A centuries-old, 50-foot California live oak tree with a 65-foot branch span 
was moved Tuesday from its original site to a spot about a quarter of a mile 
away as part of a new housing development in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"We've moved a lot of big trees but this is the largest one we've ever moved," 
said Dan Kaplanek, president of La Cresta Nurseries of East Irvine, which moved 
the Quercus agrifolia, as it is known to botanists. The Kaplanek family has 
been in the tree-moving business for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplanek said he believes that the tree is 400 to 500 years old, which would 
make it one of the oldest live oaks in California. 
</P>
<P>
The oak, with its root system, weighed 291 tons -- far too much for any truck 
to hold, Kaplanek said. So his firm developed a method in which the tree was 
boxed, then raised onto a platform with its own motorized wheels. The platform 
essentially drove itself to the new location at what will become a corner of 
Portola and Alton parkways, the first intersection that will be built in the 
new development. 
</P>
<P>
The move cost about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hon Development, which is building the 3,900-unit tract at Foothill Ranch, 
worked with the landscape architectural firm of Dike-Runa Inc. of Newport Beach 
in moving 600 to 700 live oaks and sycamores to open space areas designated 
within the project. The trees were preserved under an agreement with Orange 
County, which approved the project.

SHEFF HITS IN ANY COUNTRY, AGAINST ANY COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
LATEST ROLE FOR FORMER LAGUNA HILLS STAR: LEADING U.S. IN WORLD JUNIOR GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Sheff was starting to think that he had played one too many baseball 
games in one too many countries. According to his itinerary, the U.S. team was 
in Canada, playing a team from Brazil. The uniforms said Brazil. But the 
players were Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long season for Sheff, a graduate of Laguna Hills High School who 
is playing for the United States in the World Junior Baseball tournament in 
Trois-Rivieres, Canada, this week. 
</P>
<P>
After winning its first two games, the United States defeated Brazil, 8-1, on 
Monday. It was Brazil, all right, even though most of the players were exchange 
students from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We got there and everybody on their team was Japanese," he said. "I was 
stunned. I thought, 'They're from Brazil?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sheff didn't ponder the question too long, though. He led off the game with a 
single and finished with two hits, two runs batted in and two stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
During the past five weeks, Sheff has handled all pitching -- foreign and 
domestic -- fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic Sports Festival in Oklahoma, Sheff was five for 15 with five 
extra-base hits and six stolen bases. His performance helped the West win the 
bronze medal and earned Sheff a spot on the United States team for the World 
Junior Baseball tournament, which includes teams from 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The team played three exhibition games against Mexico in Iowa, where Sheff went 
10 for 17, before coming to Canada for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Going into tonight's game against Mexico, Sheff is five for 15 with four stolen 
bases and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheff has never had too many problems at the plate. During his four years 
at Laguna Hills, he had 129 hits, an Orange County career record. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a four-year starter on the school's basketball team, but he signed 
a letter of intent to play baseball at Pepperdine next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Chris started concentrating solely on baseball, he's improved 
tremendously," said Laguna Hills Coach Jack Hodges, who is an assistant with 
the U.S. team. "He's become a very serious hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention a well-traveled hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff, 18, hasn't been home for five weeks, beginning with the Olympic Sports 
Festival. In fact, he hasn't been home for more than five consecutive days 
since school ended in June. 
</P>
<P>
After getting two hits in the Orange County All-Star game, Sheff played in the 
Orange County vs. Los Angeles County game. 
</P>
<P>
From there, it was off to Fresno for the Southern California-Northern 
California all-star game. Sheff's next stop was Tulsa for a tournament 
featuring teams from California, Oklahoma and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enjoying playing all the time, but I would like to get home for a week or 
two," Sheff said. "Being away this long has had its advantages. I think I've 
finally learned how to do laundry. That will help when I go to college." 
</P>
<P>
When Sheff does get home on Monday, he'll have a whole day to rest before 
leaving for Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being in the minor leagues," he said. "But I got a huge bag of 
souvenirs." 
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth all-star tournament or game that Sheff has competed in this 
summer and by far the most unique and perplexing to him. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the game is pretty much the same. But there have been a few cultural 
differences, namely the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitcher will shout, 'Yabba dabba doo,' or something to his outfielder," 
Sheff said. "It's hard to understand what's going on sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheff, the U.S. players are the only ones having a problem with 
language, which puts them at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to hide and conceal our signs," Sheff said. "They don't. I was at bat 
the other night and the catcher was yelling to the pitcher. I think he was 
telling him what to throw. I wasn't going to be able to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is the tournament's defending champion. The U.S. took the 
title from Cuba last year in Sydney, Australia. Cuba had won the previous five 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"The only think I want to do is to help the United States win the gold medal 
again," Sheff said.

MAKE-BELIEVE WAR IS EASIER ON MILITARY'S BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
LATEST TECHNOLOGY PUTS CLASSROOM-BOUND GIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is little time to think. An enemy attack plane comes roaring across the 
horizon from behind a distant hill. 
</P>
<P>
A soldier in full combat gear raises a portable anti-aircraft missile launcher 
to his shoulder, picks up the attacking jet and fires off a Stinger missile. 
The action is fast -- it all happens in a matter of seconds. The 
infrared-seeking missile locks on its target, and a hit is marked by an 
exploding ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
The screen goes dark, the lights come on and there are cheers of 
congratulations from fellow GIs who witnessed the action, which didn't take 
place in the Fulda Gap region of West Germany, but in a classroom at a military 
base in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of training military personnel and keeping their skills keen -- 
it costs about $60,000 to fire off a real Stinger missile -- is forcing the 
Department of Defense to rely more on simulators -- make-believe war game 
machines -- to keep its real-world budget under control. 
</P>
<P>
The Stinger air defense training simulator, made by AAI Corp. in Cockeysville, 
Md., is just one example of the military's growing use of computer-driven 
training devices. Simulators are used for a wide variety of training, ranging 
from teaching aerial combat maneuvers to instructing new recruits to shoot the 
M-16 rifle. 
</P>
<P>
While Pentagon officials can't seem to put their fingers on the exact amount 
spent on simulators, they say it is a growth industry even at a time the 
defense budget is tightening. An Army officer estimated that the military is 
spending billions of dollars for the electronic equipment each year. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lawrence, a technology research analyst with the Prudential Bache 
Securities office in Toronto, said expenditures for all simulation and training 
programs are growing at a 21% annual rate. The total market, which was 
estimated to be $2.49 billion in 1987, is expected to approach $6.23 billion in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rounds Add Up 
</P>
<P>
"We simulate more each year as the state of the art improves," said Maj. 
Timothy McKeever of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command at Ft. Monroe, Va. 
The driving force, he said, is economics. 
</P>
<P>
Take the training of GIs to fire their rifles: McKeever said each bullet costs 
about 17 cents. "That doesn't sound like much," he said, "but when you are 
talking about a couple of hundred rounds a man and you have 200,000 trainees 
passing through, it adds up." 
</P>
<P>
To get more bull's-eyes for the dollar, the Army takes new recruits to the real 
firing range and has them squeeze off about 10 rounds each. "From this we can 
identify those that have got it -- those who have had some hunting skills when 
they were young -- and those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
"We take this latter group and have them work with the simulator, which is like 
an M-16 built into a box." The simulator imitates the sound of the rifle as 
well as its recoil. It can also pick up the flaws in the soldier's firing 
procedure so they can be corrected by the instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they master the skills on the simulator, we take them back to the range 
to fire live rounds," McKeever said. 
</P>
<P>
The M-16 simulator is on the low side of the technology scale, according to 
McKeever. "At the other end are complex simulators used to train tank crews" -- 
$16-million units made by Perceptronic Inc. and Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman Inc. 
that fill entire buildings at Ft. Knox, Ky., and Ft. Rucker, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 50 tank crews do battle at once, housed in boxes that replicate the 
interior of the M-1 Abrams tank. The simulator reproduces the terrain, and when 
a crew member looks out he sees what he would see on a battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
When a tank goes up a hill, the box tilts accordingly. "Shooting" is 
accomplished with beams of light, and a hit is marked by an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
As if that were not enough, McKeever said, it is also possible to have the 
"tanks" at Ft. Knox battle those at Ft. Rucker, via a satellite link between 
the two simulator buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The machines are expensive, but the Army compares them to the cost of tank 
shells, which can cost several hundred dollars each, and the high price of 
field maneuvers using the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civilians Bothered 
</P>
<P>
Money is a major factor in the increased use of simulators, but it is not the 
only factor, said Maj. Barry Bomier, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
He said the civilian population in the United States and abroad is becoming 
intolerant of artillery fire and having fighter jets buzz over their homes. He 
said the number of places in the United States and in Europe where military 
forces can engage in mock-war exercises are shrinking each year. 
</P>
<P>
These and other factors spur development of quieter -- and cheaper -- 
alternatives. Companies in many areas are working on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In Maryland, after winning a contract to build a shipboard missile-launching 
system for the Navy, the Martin Marietta Corp. plant at Middle River designed 
and built a simulator to train crews in loading missiles into the launchers. 
</P>
<P>
It is a large platform that duplicates the rolling motion of a ship at sea as 
crew members use a crane to try to lower dummy missiles into the canister that 
are used to store and eventually launch the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
AAI is well known for its production of artillery shells, a lightweight tank, 
smoke grenades and a lift trailer used to mount cruise missiles onto the wings 
of B-52 bombers, but about 30% of its total sales of $273 million last year 
came from producing simulation and training equipment, according to Stuart M. 
Macht, AAI's president. 
</P>
<P>
One simulator made at the company's Cockeysville complex is designed to allow 
the crew of a Navy guided-missile frigate to "fight" a sea battle in 
Mediterranean while docked at Baltimore's inner harbor. 
</P>
<P>
In an advertisement to potential buyers, AAI promotes its pier-side trainer as 
the "Great Pretender" and as an economical alternative to at-sea exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The simulator is mounted in a tractor-trailer truck, "and we plug into the 
ship's radar and electronic warfare sensors," said Lawrence J. Rytter, director 
of training. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the crew members are concerned," he added, "it's the real thing. 
There are airplanes, surface ships and submarines coming from all directions. 
They think they are fighting a war" as they take the necessary evasive action 
and go on the offense, including the "firing" of missiles at the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Rytter said the company has built eight units, which sell for about $10 million 
each, for the Navy and one for the Australian government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopters Spared 
</P>
<P>
AAI also makes simulators used in training crews of the B-52 bomber, A-10 
attack plane and F-14 and F-16 fighters in the art of electronic warfare. 
</P>
<P>
UNC Inc. in Annapolis, Md., also has a piece of the simulation business. Under 
a $70-million contract starting the first of the year, UNC uses simulators for 
the primary training of the Army's UH-1H helicopter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Dragics, director of investor relations, noted that the simulator does 
not need the maintenance required of the Army's fleet of helicopters each time 
one spends an hour in flight. 
</P>
<P>
"And if something goes wrong in the training," he added, "you don't lose an 
expensive helicopter."

CANADIAN PARTNERS OFFER TO SWEETEN BID FOR DUNKIN' DONUTS IF LAWSUIT IS WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
A Canadian partnership removed some conditions Tuesday on its $296-million 
hostile bid for Dunkin' Donuts and said it would raise the offer to $308 
million if it wins a lawsuit challenging the doughnut shop chain's 
anti-takeover measures. 
</P>
<P>
DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara 
Operations Ltd., said it would raise its price to $45 a share, from $43, if 
Delaware's Chancery Court orders Dunkin' Donuts to rescind its employee stock 
ownership plan and other defenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based partnership's offer originally was contingent on obtaining 
75% of the doughnut company's shares. That offer, which was set to expire at 
midnight Tuesday, was extended until Sept. 15 and is now contingent on 
obtaining just 50.1%, or a bare majority, of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are saying by dropping the minimum number of shares is that we're 
prepared to buy a voting control position and hang around until we get actual 
control, which could take a couple of years," said Eric W. Evans, a spokesman 
for Kingsbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Dunkin' Donuts, which is based in suburban Randolph, had no immediate response 
to the revised offer. The reaction on Wall Street was lukewarm; Dunkin' Donuts 
shares rose 37 1/2 cents to close at $37.87 1/2 in over-the-counter trading 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsbridge, the merchant banking arm of investor George Mann's Unicorp Canada 
Corp., offered a friendly merger with Dunkin' Donuts at $42 a share in May. 
When it was rebuffed, it joined with Cara, the parent company of two Canadian 
restaurant chains, to launch the $43-a-share hostile offer. 
</P>
<P>
Dunkin' Donuts has set up a series of tough defenses, including the employee 
stock ownership plan, which holds about 16% of its outstanding common shares. 
</P>
<P>
It also has a shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," designed to increase 
the number of shares in the event of a takeover, making a merger prohibitively 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
And it has sold $28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an 11% stake in 
the company, to an avowedly friendly investor, General Electric Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsbridge and Cara have filed suit in Delaware charging that the employee 
stock plan and preferred stock sale were improperly put in place solely to 
prevent a takeover. The Canadian partners also have asked the Chancery Court to 
order Dunkin' Donuts to remove its poison pill. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the court refused to grant the partnership a preliminary injunction 
against the takeover defenses. The case has not yet been scheduled to be heard 
on its merits.

MEDIAN PRICE OF RESALE HOMES IN COUNTY SOARS TO $247,636, 3RD-HIGHEST IN NATION 
</P>

<P>
The price of a house in Orange County -- a median $247,636 in the second 
quarter -- is the third-highest in the nation, lagging behind only San 
Francisco and Honolulu, the National Assn. of Realtors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles ranked fourth and Boston ranked fifth. The West and the Northeast 
are once again the most expensive markets for single-family detached houses, 
the trade association found. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. median was $92,900 in the second quarter, which ended in June. The 
trade association does not count new houses. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found the disparity in home prices around the nation growing 
wider. Peoria, Ill., had the lowest price: $47,700. 
</P>
<P>
Still, home buyers in Orange County can find some consolation in the figures: A 
year ago, the county had the most expensive houses in the nation. As recently 
as the first three months of 1989, Orange County ranked second after San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The county's high prices hurt sales during the first half of 1989, the 
California Assn. of Realtors reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 14.5% from the first half of 1988, the trade association estimated. 
That was the biggest dip among California's metropolitan areas. In fact, sales 
actually increased statewide by 6.5%, although they are now starting to slow 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Prices, however, continue to rise in Orange County and in California. In the 
county, the median price jumped 23.8% and nearly $48,000 from a year ago; from 
$199,999 in the second quarter of 1988 to $247,636 now. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide increase in prices wasn't far behind: Prices rose 22.4% -- to 
$201,833 -- from $164,857 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County housing market, say real estate experts, is cooling compared 
to last year's buying frenzy, which pushed prices through the roof. But the 
market remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a more normal type of market, unlike last year when there was no 
inventory of unsold houses and a house might sell in a matter of minutes," said 
Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of the trade association's research 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"And people aren't able to get the kind of prices they want when they put their 
house up for sale, so instead they're tending to stay put longer." 
</P>
<P>
More recent figures show the Orange County market continued to slow after the 
second quarter. TRW Real Estate Market Information reported Tuesday that sales 
of all homes -- new and used, houses and condominiums -- dropped 36.9% in July 
from a year ago, from 5,482 units to 3,461. 
</P>
<P>
Prices, however, continued to rise, the Colton marketing consultant said. The 
average for houses and condominiums in the county hit $252,987, up 18.1% from 
$214,333 a year ago.

CAROLE KING SEEKS BALANCE ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a good part of the 1980s, Carole King pursued the quiet, private existence 
of a homebody on the range. 
</P>
<P>
While life on her 118-acre ranch in Idaho may have nourished King's soul, it 
did not feed her creative urge as a songwriter. More than five years elapsed 
from 1984, the time of her last album, until the release of "City Streets," the 
new record that has prompted King to go back on the road for a tour that 
reaches the Pacific Amphitheatre tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling too much peace," said King, 47. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while I was writing about the only conflict I was dealing with": a long 
court battle against the federal government, which wanted access to a private 
road through King's property so it could speed development of a neighboring 
mining tract. Songs inspired by the environmental dispute (eventually decided 
in King's favor) "didn't seem to resonate with the mainstream of popular 
music," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of writing a new album, King devoted her artistic energies to acting. 
She took a couple of small film parts and played more substantial roles in 
plays staged in New York and Los Angeles. As a New York City teen-ager, King 
had studied acting at the city's famed High School for the Performing Arts. She 
continued to attend acting classes and workshops as her musical career 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she returned to Manhattan to play the lead in a play called "A Minor 
Incident." 
</P>
<P>
"I really got back in touch with the energy and the emotional turmoil of the 
city," King said. "That is what really inspired the writing of the "City 
Streets" album, and its energy." Feelings of loneliness and romantic yearning, 
set against a chilly urban landscape, form the emotional core of the album. 
</P>
<P>
Now, King said, she parcels out her time among New York, Los Angeles and the 
Idaho ranch where she and her fourth husband raise horses, mules and goats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to me to have that place to go and recharge and have the 
natural beauty," she said. "Just get on my horse and ride, go into the 
mountains and contemplate a stream. I need both. My work is very important to 
me, and that takes place best in the city." 
</P>
<P>
As one of pop's preeminent songwriters, King has written definitive musical 
evocations of both the country and the city. With lyricist Gerry Goffin, the 
former husband with whom she still collaborates, King wrote "Up on the Roof" 
for the Drifters, achieving the height of urban romanticism. "Wasn't Born to 
Follow," recorded by the Byrds, speaks of rural wanderings with rippling 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
If King's muse responds to both the tenement and the forest, her psyche never 
has been geared very well to the demands of the road. She summed up her problem 
with touring in "You're So Far Away," one of the many enduring songs from 
King's 1971 soft-rock album landmark, "Tapestry." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely, 
</P>
<P>
Nothing else to do but close my mind. 
</P>
<P>
I sure hope the road don't come to own me, 
</P>
<P>
There's so many dreams I've yet to find. 
</P>
<P>
King said she had some of those old misgivings as she started out last month on 
her first tour since 1984. But, for the first time, she has found that the road 
can be fun. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first (tour) I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute," King said, 
her grainy speaking voice taking on extra brightness. "I don't mind the hotel 
rooms, the travel, any of it. I love the band, and I love the response I'm 
getting on stage." 
</P>
<P>
She also likes the audience mix she is seeing at her shows: the Baby Boomers 
who all bought "Tapestry" during the '70s, making it one of the best-selling 
albums in pop history, and the younger fans who are also turning up. 
</P>
<P>
Oldtime King fans who go to the shows at the Pacific and at the Universal 
Amphitheatre on Thursday will get to hear eight selections from "Tapestry," 
which King plays without fear of being considered stuck in the past: "I'm aware 
that people want to hear it. Most of the songs from that album are personal 
favorites of mine, so it was easy to say, 'I'll do these eight.' Whichever ones 
are the most fun for me to play -- that is the overriding criterion." 
</P>
<P>
King said she also has fun with a more rocking, contemporary-sounding segment 
of the show in which she steps out from behind her piano (she has her 
son-in-law, veteran New York City session musician Robbie Kondor, to look after 
the keyboards) and either straps on an electric guitar or bops with a hand-held 
microphone. That segment includes a new version of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow?" 
in which King lets fly with a bona fide rap. 
</P>
<P>
"The song (a No. 1 hit for the Shirelles in 1960) has been around so long, I 
looked for a way to have fun with it and make it contemporary," she said. "I 
see the audience's collective jaw drop when I begin the rap. Then they get into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
King said she is not just using rap as a gimmick but has a genuine liking for 
it -- a taste that is a little surprising in a songwriter whose forte, an 
exquisite sense of melody, is foreign to rap. 
</P>
<P>
"I do draw the line," she said. "I do not have any affinity for (rap) lyrics 
that advocate violence. Although I'm aware that as a white woman I did not grow 
up under the same circumstances as a group like NWA. If there is anger, anger 
most definitely should be expressed, but it should focus on how (one) can take 
this anger and make this situation better. 
</P>
<P>
"My 15-year-old son listens to rap. We listen to some of the music together. We 
discuss it. I tell him my opinion of the violence, and he agrees with me. The 
sexual stuff we just laugh at. It opens up a dialogue. The parents who are 
seeking to have that music banned are making a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
(King, who is Jewish, said one rap group she has not heard, and knows nothing 
about, is Public Enemy, the militantly political ensemble that has been 
embroiled in controversy because of flagrantly anti-Semitic interviews given by 
a member of its performing entourage.) 
</P>
<P>
King said her teen-age son and daughter live in Idaho with her former husband, 
musician Charles Larkey. Louise and Sherry Goffin, the two daughters from her 
first marriage, are both pursuing their own musical careers. Louise has been a 
recording artist since her teens. King said Sherry, who is married to her 
mother's touring keyboard player, Kondor, fronts a New York City band called 
Sherry and the Sugar Beats that is working on "an album of children's music 
sort of like the 'Little Chill.' It's music from the 'Big Chill' era, the '60s 
and '70s," geared for contemporary kids and their musically nostalgic parents. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the Goffin-King songs from that era that became pop standards in 
performances by other singers, King says Aretha Franklin's reading of "(You 
Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman" gives her the biggest chill. 
</P>
<P>
"That would stand out in my mind as the all time blow-me-down pinnacle of how a 
song of mine could be sung," she said. 
</P>
<P>
King, who sounds well in touch with the current pop scene, said she also gets a 
kick out of knowing that "The Locomotion" has been a hit in three different 
decades (in the '60s for Little Eva, who was baby-sitter for King and Goffin 
before they made her a star, in the '70s for Grand Funk and in the '80s for 
Kylie Minogue). She is also happy to hear that Martika, a hot pop newcomer whom 
King likes, is planning to release "I Feel the Earth Move" as a single. 
</P>
<P>
With all those famous or imposing versions of her songs that other stars have 
sung, has King ever felt nervous about tackling any of them herself? 
</P>
<P>
"Never," she said. "I always figure I wrote it, I have the validation to sing 
it any way I want." 
</P>
<P>

'THE CAJUN BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THAT BIZARRE ENTREE PROMISE, TOUPS' ZYDECO CAREER HAS HAD ITS DRY WELLS 
AND GUSHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Toups was born 30 years ago in Lafayette, La., "the Capital of Cajun 
Country." As a full-blooded Cajun growing up in the small neighboring town of 
Crowley, he was surrounded virtually from birth by the region's distinctive 
accordion-dominated music. 
</P>
<P>
Signed last year to PolyGram Records as only the second Cajun-zydeco act on a 
major label (the Buckwheat Zydeco band was first), Toups is now one of a 
handful positioned to bring that effusively joyful music beyond its cult 
following to mainstream popularity. 
</P>
<P>
He found his entree into the record business through, in the words of the D.L. 
Menard song considered the Cajun national anthem, "the back door." 
</P>
<P>
Toups, who will be opening for Carole King (see accompanying story) at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre tonight, landed his record deal as a result of bizarre 
coincidences, according to Steve Popovich, the former PolyGram vice president 
who signed Toups before leaving the label earlier this year for a sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
"I had first read about Wayne in an airline magazine article about Cajun 
music," Popovich said from Nashville. "It had called him 'the Cajun Bruce 
Springsteen' because of his marathon live shows. I had underlined his name 
because of that. The next day I was in my office trying to dig up more 
information about him, when a guy I hadn't seen in years walked into my 
reception area with another guy, and said he had a project he just had to play 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
That "other guy" was Toups, and the project that promotion man Steve Topley had 
with him was Toups' previous album, "Johnnie Can't Dance," which had been 
released by a small Louisiana label. 
</P>
<P>
"The raw energy and excitement I heard on that record was so different, I got 
really enthusiastic about it," Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the analogy to Springsteen, Toups was signed to the label's country 
division in Nashville, largely because of Popovich's desire to line up artists 
who broadened the boundaries of country music. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to sign things that would only go up Billboard country charts 
that are built on just 150 (country radio) stations," Popovich said. "I wanted 
something that could happen worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved accordions. . . . I felt Wayne had a shot to take accordions 
to a wider audience. I think Wayne stands above a lot of the other Cajun and 
zydeco musicians because of the energy, he's all over the stage. . . . In fact, 
after I left PolyGram, I think the Nashville office didn't feel comfortable 
handling something like Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Toups was shifted from the country division over to the company's rock 
promotion department. Actually, Toups cites none of the great Cajun 
accordionists as his chief role model: "I've always wanted to play the 
accordion the way that Duane Allman played the slide guitar," he said from 
Boise, Ida., where he was opening for King. 
</P>
<P>
Like most U.S. youths -- even those in rural Louisiana's Cajun country -- Toups 
grew up listening to rock 'n' roll. He was also enamored of such soul greats at 
Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and James Brown, influences that 
are quickly apparent in his dusky vocals. 
</P>
<P>
On "Blast From the Bayou," the major-label debut of Toups and his Zydecajun 
band, several rollicking, upbeat tunes typical of zydeco (the R&amp;B-infused 
cousin of the more countrified Cajun style) are interspersed with a couple of 
rather bold covers: Aaron Neville's 1966 hit "Tell It Like It Is" and Van 
Morrison's "Tupelo Honey." 
</P>
<P>
Why on earth take on rock standards originally recorded by two of pop music's 
finest singers? Toups said it was a case of genuine love for the songs, rather 
than any cocky attempt to improve on the original versions: "The record company 
definitely wanted some cover tunes. 'Tell It Like It Is' is a fabulous tune. 
It's been part of our act for a while, and if I didn't think we could do it 
justice, I never would have done it." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the audiences Toups has been playing to with King, the Cajun 
accordion he wields is a curious contraption. Resembling in bellows only the 
more familiar piano accordion (picture Myron Floren and "The Lawrence Welk 
Show"), the unusual Cajun variety features a single row of 10 buttons for the 
right hand. Like a blues harmonica ("only more expensive," Toups quipped), the 
Cajun accordion plays in just one key, though they can be built in any number 
of keys. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has been playing the accordion since he was 14, he quit in the late 
'70s when got married and had a son. To supply his family with the steady 
income that was not available to him then as a musician, he went to work in the 
oil fields, ran a backhoe and for a while worked as a gravedigger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done enough physical labor," he said, "to say I've worked for a living." 
</P>
<P>
About 1982, he formed a band to play gigs at night and on weekends, and by 
1985, performing three or four dances a week, he was earning enough to quit the 
day jobs. Before the PolyGram album, Toups released two albums for independent 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
For all his desire to create a rock-based Cajun-zydeco hybrid that is more 
commercially potent, Toups still gets some of his greatest rewards from playing 
the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
He turned in one of many highlights at the 1989 New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage 
Festival during an informal performance and lecture that teamed him with fellow 
accordionist Steve Riley. Each demonstrated his approach to the same material 
-- Riley using a seamless, traditional Cajun technique and Toups (dressed in 
his trademark tank top, headband and flowery Bermuda shorts) countering with a 
more muscular, rock-conscious style. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the traditional music," he said last week. "I love to do that when we 
are at home, and I always sing (some songs) in French. But I also think the 
music has to expand. You can't just keep the old -- you also need the new. It's 
like the folklorists say: You can't cut all the branches off, or the roots will 
die."

SHAKY 'AFTERSHOCK' VIEWS FAMILY CHASMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They keep telling us that the "big one" is coming, with a vengeance. It's going 
to lay us out flat, kick some tail. The future includes one mean rumbler, and 
none of us are really prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County playwright Allison Gappa agrees with the Red Cross and everybody 
else who keeps warning us about earthquakes -- indifference is suicidal, and 
education and readiness are the ways to prevent disaster. The Red Cross sends 
out pamphlets; Gappa wrote "Aftershock," now premiered at the small Way Off 
Broadway theater in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
With only the best intentions, Gappa's play tries to do many things, especially 
inform us about the dangers while keeping us following the melodrama that is 
unleashed after a 9-point-something quake forces a feuding family into an 
underground bomb shelter. "Aftershock" is part survival kit, part soap opera 
and part religious sampler. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a pretty rough piece of theater. The dialogue often sounds false, and 
certain scenes are weak and contrived. There are also a few continuity 
problems, the most obvious being the earthquake's carnage -- in the first act, 
the McNamara family and assorted in-laws apparently don't want to leave the 
shelter because it would be a hellish 10-mile walk to town, but the second act 
has them trapped under tons of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well. These may be mistakes Gappa can correct. It'll take some work, though. 
</P>
<P>
Gappa and set designer Robert Wilson have given "Aftershock" a sense of reality 
when it comes to preparedness. The look is right, with bottled water, canned 
foods, vats for waste and all the other necessities required to survive the 
days following a quake. Gappa, who also directs, said she was counseled by the 
Red Cross, and it shows. 
</P>
<P>
However, in trying to make the play a theatrical event, she tends to lose 
proportion. The "big one," by all accounts, will be terrifying and destructive, 
but Gappa likens it to a nuclear attack. Trees are ripped out by their roots, 
the landscape is leveled and characters ask each other what kind of "world" 
remains. They seem to think the earthquake has wasted the entire globe, not 
just Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The physical and mental impact on the McNamaras is graphic. Just about everyone 
gets hurt, and mother Hilda (Laurel Koelsch) ends up bedridden with a bloody 
blow to the head. It's very intense. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures reveal that the three daughters, especially pretty model Melissa 
(Denison Glass) and icy lawyer Lenore (Brenda Fogarty), don't dig each other. 
They squabble non-stop. Melissa's photographer husband (Tony Reverditto) snorts 
cocaine and devilishly snaps flash pictures of everybody. Web (Ron Althouse), a 
family friend, takes off his shirt and puts the moves on Lenore. The local 
pastor (Brendan Beach) tells everybody to have faith in God. He tells them that 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
But the wildest stuff is left for dad (Thomas Reilly), an ex-Navy man who built 
the shelter and has his annoying good sense vindicated by the quake. He screams 
at everybody to get with the program. He starts ordering folks around. He gets 
red in the face and shakes one of his daughters. In short, he turns into a 
subterranean Capt. Queeg. 
</P>
<P>
Way Off Broadway has acquired a reputation for being a little wacky, and this 
first act has its wacky moments, all right. It even has a certain cockeyed 
charm, especially when Reilly does his thing and Reverditto sasses about. 
</P>
<P>
But "Aftershock" is resigned to have a bittersweet but generally happy ending, 
and the second act ties up loose ends in various clumsy ways. All the domestic 
battling stops -- the girls start getting along, the photographer says no to 
drugs and is nice to everyone and Web and Lenore begin courting. Even dad 
mellows out (one character says, "I guess it just took the opening of the earth 
to open his heart."). 
</P>
<P>
The aftershocks finally stop. They dig through. There's light outside. The 
pastor says a long prayer, and the play ends. 
</P>
<P>

Participation in high school sports had a positive effect for many minority and 
female students in certain areas, but did not help them in college or the work 
force, according to a study released by the Women's Sports Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Whites did benefit in their careers from athletic participation, according to 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
The findings showed gains in academic achievement, leadership aspirations and 
social involvement for minority and female students. 
</P>
<P>
The report analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Education's High School 
and Beyond study. It showed that minority athletes fared better academically.

An attorney for cyclist Greg LeMond said that the rider is "90% certain" to 
sign a contract with the U.S. team 7-Eleven within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Terms should be worked out by next week," Nathan Jenkins said from his Reno 
office. "There isn't a signature on anything, but it's close. We should have an 
agreement in principle." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond won the Tour de France in dramatic fashion last month and promptly 
announced his interest in joining a U.S. cycling team. He left ADR, his Belgian 
team, last week.

KEVIN GREENE EXPECTS SACKFUL OF SUCCESS FOR RAMS THIS SEASON

It's mid-August and linebacker Kevin Greene is already putting on his game 
face. It's a frightening face, not unlike those pinned up on post office walls. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's eyes open wide as saucers as he warns visitors not to bring up events 
of the past, as if his were sordid or controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Greene emerged from nowhere last season -- ask about half a dozen 
opposing quarterbacks -- to the brink of stardom in the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
His 16 1/2 sacks were second in the league only to the prime-time minister 
himself, defensive end Reggie White of the Philadelphia Eagles, who had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's is an ultimate success story. He is a former intramural flag football 
player who walked on at the University of Auburn and rose steadily from the 
depths of the depth chart. He was the Rams' fifth-round pick in 1985 and 
flourished last season when the team converted to the attacking Eagle defense, 
a five-linebacker scheme tailor-made for Greene's skills as an outside pass 
rusher. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are your attackers," Coach John Robinson said of his backers. "Those are 
the guys who are screaming at you. And we felt Kevin was a screamer." 
</P>
<P>
Greene had more sacks in 1988 than Lawrence Taylor's 15.5, Bruce Smith's 11, 
Richard Dent's 10 1/2 and Cornelius Bennett's 9 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Greene, who spends part of his off-seasons crawling out of foxholes as a 
captain in the Army Reserve, claims he has already blipped last year from his 
radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it was satisfying," Greene says between bites and gulps of 
training-camp chow. "It was a good time. I had a lot of fun last year. But I 
don't want to talk about last year anymore. So many people are asking me about 
last year. That's over with. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking from here on. Sixteen-and-a-half sacks are under the bridge, 
compared to what's coming up here in the next couple weeks? You know what I 
mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't want to talk about it anymore," he says. "I can't keep talking 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
Greene, was promoted to this higher rank by Robinson after a few years of 
special teams -- football's version of KP. He says he never kept track of other 
players last season. His orders are to attack the opposing quarterback as often 
as possible, not compile statistics like some company clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even think about it," he says. "Nope. I didn't. I feel like I can be 
a dominant player in this league regardless of who else is a dominant player. 
You say Reggie White, whoever. I feel Kevin Greene can be a dominant player. To 
beat out Lawrence Taylor, am I supposed to freak out on that?" 
</P>
<P>
Robinson realized a few years ago he had a live wire in Greene, who listens to 
old war songs before games just to set the mood. 
</P>
<P>
It was that sort of talent and devotion that moved Robinson to experiment with 
the Eagle, which might lead Greene and Mike Wilcher on clearer paths to the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson could almost predict big things for Greene if all went as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I still lit candles and all that stuff," Robinson said. "But it's the design. 
We expect him to have a better year, he and Wilcher both. Maybe it's exceeding 
our expectations, but not our hopes." 
</P>
<P>
Greene is off to another fast start -- "Right on target," as he calls it. He 
sacked Denver's John Elway twice in the first quarter last Saturday night, 
chasing the Broncos' million-dollar investment to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Greene completed another two week, off-season stint of active duty at 
Ft. Knox in Kentucky. He says it's a good way to get ready for a war or a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very patriotic," Greene says. "I like the discipline, the regimen, 
following orders." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some players, who have to be lassoed and dragged to training camp, 
Greene came to California a month early, just to work out the kinks and soak up 
the scenery. Days before veterans were due in, he could be found prowling the 
sidelines as rookies practiced, waiting for the second he could fasten his chin 
strap. 
</P>
<P>
"Football training camp is a pain in the butt," he says. "But we're still 
living the dream." 
</P>
<P>
By all rights, Greene's dream should include a few more decimal points. Like a 
good soldier, though, he's playing out the last year of a $250,000 contract, 
peanuts compared to the millions Taylor and Smith and White are fighting over. 
</P>
<P>
Greene bites his upper lip and lets loose his best maniacal stare. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get my dues when it's time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As if Greene's in this game just for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm living a dream, man," he says. "That's all I can say. Are you kidding? 
Kids growing up would give their left arm to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Fred Strickland out with a knee injury and the team a little thin at 
inside linebacker to begin with, Coach John Robinson has moved second-round 
choice Frank Stams inside in some alignments. "We're anxious to get him in an 
area where he can help us the most this year," Robinson said. "Whether he stays 
there for long term I don't know." Stams, from Notre Dame, was drafted as an 
outside linebacker. . . . Free agent Richard Ashe, who was making great strides 
as a blocking tight end, will be out another week with a sprained ankle. There 
was more bad news at Tuesday's evening practice when Gary Knudson, the team's 
only healthy tight end, was carried off the field with a lower back strain. 
Linebacker Mel Owens also missed practice with a back strain. Free-agent 
receiver Brian Hawkins left the field on a cart after suffering a hamstring 
pull.

ARUM DROPS NUNN AFTER FIGHTER'S LACKLUSTER VICTORY OVER BARKLEY

Michael Nunn, who failed to sell out the 11,000-seat arena Monday night in Reno 
and was lackluster in his defense of the International Boxing Federation 
middleweight championship against Iran Barkley, was dropped Tuesday by promoter 
Bob Arum, one fight short of the expiration of their contract. 
</P>
<P>
Arum said Monday that he had not wanted the fight in the Lawlor Events Center 
at the University of Nevada Reno, where it drew an embarrassingly small crowd 
of 5,900. Even worse, there were more boos than cheers when Nunn was given a 
majority decision, and most outspoken of all was Arum, who derisively called 
Nunn "an ESPN fighter" afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dan Goossen, Nunn's manager: "(Nunn) wasn't sharp . . . but I was a little 
disappointed over Arum's comments. . . . "Bob and I came to an understanding a 
few weeks ago that we'd go our separate ways after this fight. We had one more 
Arum fight left under our contract, but we've both agreed to end our 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Arum was in San Francisco Tuesday, promoting his Dec. 7 Leonard-Duran fight, 
and could not be reached for comment. EARL GUSTKEY

EX-RACER TIM RICHMOND DIES IN FLORIDA AT AGE 34

Tim Richmond, a former Indianapolis 500 rookie of the year whose subsequent 
stock car racing career was cut short by controversy and illness nearly two 
years ago, is dead at age 34. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond died Sunday with his parents at his side in Good Samaritan Hospital in 
West Palm Beach, his physician, David Dodson, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson, citing the wishes of the family and medical confidentiality, declined 
to give the cause of death or talk about Richmond's medical condition. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say where or when a funeral would be held. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond led the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit with seven victories in 1986 before 
contracting what he said was pneumonia a year later. 
</P>
<P>
His career ended when NASCAR suspended him before the 1988 season-opening 
Daytona 500 for failing a drug test showing excessive amounts of two 
non-prescription drugs found in over-the-counter remedies for allergies and 
respiratory conditions. He passed a subsequent test, was reinstated, but failed 
to get a ride. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, who lived in semi-seclusion in south Florida, had been hospitalized 
recently for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, friend and former 
physician Jerry Punch said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond drove Indy cars and was the Indy 500 rookie of the year in 1980 before 
switching to stock cars. He had 13 career victories, including two immediately 
after returning from a layoff due to illness in 1987. After six more starts 
that year he quit again, citing his health. 
</P>
<P>
He sued the stock car sanctioning body in April, 1988, for suspending him after 
a drug test. An out-of-court settlement was reached later that year. 
</P>
<P>
The Ashland, Ohio, native vehemently denied rumors of drug use in his last 
public appearance, at a news conference at Daytona Beach, Fla., in February, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Pseudoephedrine . . . was deemed to render Richmond hazardous in a race car," 
the sanctioning body said in a statement attributed to its drug adviser, Dr. 
Forest S. Tennant. "The measured amount indicated a dosage five to 20 times the 
normal amount." 
</P>
<P>
However, a negative test on Feb. 6 resulted in reinstatement of Richmond's 
NASCAR license. He said he was on medication for a cold and a severe sinus 
problem.

MISSING TRAINING CAMP PUTS A BURDEN ON PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Picture walking, or even sitting, in a four-pound hat. 
</P>
<P>
Then consider that a football player covers himself with nearly 20 pounds of 
equipment, including hip pads, shoulder pads and the four-pound helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy equipment sets football players apart from other athletes. They must 
learn to play a difficult game, one requiring considerable speed and agility, 
while encumbered in perhaps more armor than any warrior has worn since medieval 
times. 
</P>
<P>
And they must relearn it each summer, after spending the off-season in tank 
tops and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, each summer, holdouts and other National Football League players missing 
the training-camp grind usually fall far behind their teammates. Many never 
catch up. Few reach their potential in the year of a holdout. And, reinstated 
holdouts often have more injuries. 
</P>
<P>
This year it is Raider Coach Mike Shanahan's bad luck to have two prominent 
absentees. His team is playing the exhibition schedule without both starting 
running backs, Marcus Allen and Bo Jackson -- one a holdout, one batting 
cleanup for the Kansas City Royals in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
When they come back, how long will it take them to catch the other Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, an hour or two," Shanahan said. "Physically, days or weeks. The big 
thing is, you have to get used to carrying the pads. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcus and Bo will both be in good physical condition when they come in -- 
most football players these days are -- but there's a big difference between 
peak physical condition for a jogger and peak football condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you can play football properly, you have to experience the discomfort 
and drudgery of contact -- over a period of time -- while carrying all those 
pads. It's a different world. And if your (teammates) are ahead of you, it can 
be long and painful." 
</P>
<P>
Allen's reason for holding out is doubtless both pressing and valid -- he does 
nothing lightly -- but it will be costly. 
</P>
<P>
As for Bo Jackson, the marvel is that he can play competitive big league 
football after missing training camp each year plus half the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, of course, has it easier than Allen. Though heavier by 25 or 30 
pounds, Jackson can't block. He lacks both the toughness and aptitude for 
blocking, meaning that in a Jackson-Allen backfield, Allen must move to 
fullback, which in the NFL is a dog's life for 200-pound converted halfbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Is Jackson worth all this? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I've never seen a back with more talent," Shanahan said. "He has speed, 
strength, size and moves, and he can catch it. It's amazing that he averaged 
4.3 yards last year behind an inexperienced line. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bo were with us through the off-season and training camp, he would become 
known as the greatest who ever played the game." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball people have reached a similar kind of conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell you that you've got to hit year-round, more or less, to reach your 
potential as a hitter," Shanahan said. "In the old days, baseball and football 
weren't perceived that way. But today they're both year-round sports -- if your 
goal is excellence. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes Bo unique -- that he can excel in both while losing months 
of practice time in both." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's goal is to be No. 1 in both. That once seemed impossible, but he's 
getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
The two most interesting physical specimens in the NFL are probably Bo Jackson 
and Herschel Walker, who resemble one another in size, speed and strength as 
well as effectiveness in getting the ball up the field. 
</P>
<P>
Each is a sprinter with the build of a fullback -- bigger than other running 
backs, and also, astonishingly, faster. 
</P>
<P>
"I went against both in college," Shanahan said. "And I don't remember that we 
ever controlled either of them." 
</P>
<P>
But if the players are physically similar, they are viewed very differently. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys appreciate that Walker is "a tough, hard-nosed leader who, 
if there's a way to win, will find it." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody says this about Jackson, who is best described, by those who know him, 
as a finely-tuned machine. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson nears perfection, his teammates in both sports say, except for one 
thing: a reluctance to play hurt. If Walker is a team man, Jackson is a Jackson 
man. 
</P>
<P>
As football players, there is one other difference between them. Carrying the 
ball, Walker is a straight-ahead runner, whereas Jackson has the natural moves 
and elusiveness of a clever, small halfback -- making Jackson much more 
valuable in the open field. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of Walker, however, that he has set out this year to become 
more elusive. He is working on his moves with the same diligence that he works 
with the weights, and he has lost a few pounds to further the cause. 
</P>
<P>
There was even one small payoff in San Diego Sunday when, on a short run, he 
seemed to make a Charger tackler miss. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom is that elusiveness comes naturally or not at all. But the 
same was once said of a player's speed. First the dream, then the 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jackson, Walker is a dreamer, though what he wants is a little less. 
Walker merely wants to be trickier. Jackson wants to dominate two sports. 
</P>
<P>
As of today, strangely, Jackson might be closer to his goal than Walker is to 
his. 
</P>
<P>
From New Orleans, David F. Dixon, father of the Superdome and founder of the 
United States Football League, says he will sue the NFL for interrupting his 
plans to get into spring football. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL this year has been developing an international spring league, which it 
calls the World League, with four teams in Europe and six or eight in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's single-entity plan is similar to Dixon's. Both proposed leagues would 
be owned by stockholders who would sell franchises to participating cities. 
</P>
<P>
But Dixon doubts if America is big enough for two such new leagues. And, noting 
that the World League hopes to get off the ground first, he objects to an NFL 
monopoly of both spring and fall football, freezing out the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope you share our belief that the NFL's monopolization of football should 
be a matter of concern everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also calls the proposed World League player draft a violation of antitrust 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL draft is legal only because it was (authorized by the NFL Players 
Assn.)," Dixon said. "Does GE or GM or IBM have the legal right to draft its 
personnel? What gives the (World League) this right?" 
</P>
<P>
He is asking Congress about that. 
</P>
<P>
Both leagues seem to be shooting for a 1991 start-up.

LITTLE LEAGUE SAYS IT WILL NOT PERMIT CASH INCENTIVES

Cash incentives for Little Leaguers violate official rules and will not be 
permitted next season, a league administrator in western Maryland said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Stouffer, administrator of more than 10 leagues in Washington, Garrett and 
Allegany counties, said he planned to meet with the league's board of directors 
during the next few weeks to put an end to cash incentives that two coaches in 
Boonsboro's South Mountain League gave their players this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"These are dedicated guys, but all of us can make a mistake once in a while," 
Stouffer said. "We just can't allow this to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Delbert House, manager of the South Mountain league, said last week that he 
rewarded players with $1 for their first hit in a game and gave $5 to players 
who hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The other coach, Robert Keller, said he gave his players a dime for each hit, a 
quarter for an outstanding fielding play and $1 for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches said Monday that they would be willing to discuss the cash rewards 
with Stouffer, and House promised to stop the rewards if he managed a team next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said he liked giving money to players from poorer families who cannot 
afford to give the youngsters money for the ballpark concession stand. He also 
said he once bought a player a glove. 
</P>
<P>
"His family was too poor to afford it, so I bought the boy a glove," he said. 
"When he asked me how he could repay me, I told him just to get a couple of 
hits. I guess I paid that player, too." 
</P>
<P>
E.J. Lehotsky, a senior official in Little League International, based in 
Williamsport, Pa., said leagues that knowingly violate the regulations can lose 
their charters.

CASKET CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
A CUT-RATE RETAILER IS DISLIKED BY FUNERAL DIRECTORS AND SHUNNED BY SOME 
SUPPLIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is the sort of window display that stops you dead in your tracks: Soft back 
lighting, discreet potted plants -- and shiny, open coffins with names such as 
"Emerald Mist," "Lord's Last Supper" and "Going Home." 
</P>
<P>
The windows in question are on Main and 9th streets in downtown Santa Ana, 
where Hillmark Casket Gallery opened its doors seven weeks ago to a hail of 
outrage from the funeral industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sheralee and Kyle Nyswonger own the Santa Ana store and its sister casket shop 
in Loma Linda in San Bernardino County, which industry watchers say are the 
only strictly retail casket establishments in the nation. To the Nyswongers, 
Hillmark is a way to make a living while helping the grief-stricken save money 
at a time of great sadness and expense. 
</P>
<P>
But to the close-knit funeral industry, the Nyswongers are virtually committing 
blasphemy -- disrupting the tidy supply chain that traditionally links casket 
makers and funeral directors and underselling the competition in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers are so hot that Ron Hast, publisher of Mortuary Management magazine and 
a partner in Abbott &amp; Hast Mortuary in Los Angeles, likens the young 
entrepreneurs to "wholesale butchers," and the nation's largest casket makers 
are refusing to supply Hillmark, citing longtime policies of dealing only with 
licensed funeral directors. 
</P>
<P>
Buying a casket from the Nyswongers "would be like going to a restaurant and 
saying, 'I want your chef's ability to serve fine meals, but I want to bring my 
own steak, because I can get it cheaper at the butcher shop,' " Hast said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when a consumer buys a casket at a retail establishment, most funeral 
homes tack on "handling fees" of up to $1,000. Funeral directors, therefore, 
contend that retail casket companies make dying more -- not less -- expensive. 
But the handling fees are under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which 
investigates unfair and deceptive business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Nyswonger's response to comments such as Hast's is a shrug and a smile. After 
all, she concedes, if the burial industry is in such an uproar, then she must 
be doing something right. The Nyswongers sell their caskets for $489 to $1,530, 
which she says beats funeral homes' prices by 30% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has already received about 100 requests for distributorships from 
throughout the nation. And the 9-month-old Loma Linda store should bring in 
$250,000 in sales its first year of operation. Nyswonger views these as good 
indications that she was right to sell caskets instead of styling hair or 
selling flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"We work within peoples' budgets," she said. "I wouldn't want to have to bury 
my husband and scrimp and save to buy him a casket. Services are expensive 
enough. A full-service funeral costs $5,000." 
</P>
<P>
By buying a casket at Hillmark, she said, a family can save in the neighborhood 
of $1,000. "That's why we're in business." 
</P>
<P>
Until 1988, Sheralee Nyswonger, 26, had spent most of her short career working 
in florist shops arranging flowers and in medical offices processing records. 
Kyle Nyswonger, 30, was the sales manager for an automobile dealership, a post 
he still holds. 
</P>
<P>
When the entrepreneurial spirit hit, Sheralee Nyswonger said they first thought 
of more traditional businesses, but "we decided there's a hair salon or a 
florist on every other corner." Processing medical records gave her some 
knowledge of the costs of death to a family, she said, costs that she realized 
could be lessened. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "people are more shopping- and price-conscious these days," she 
said. "If they know they can get something at Price Club, they'll go there and 
not to a department store." 
</P>
<P>
It took two months for Sheralee Nyswonger to persuade her husband that they 
could make a profit in caskets. On Nov. 11, 1988, the first Hillmark Casket 
Gallery opened in Loma Linda. Its profits, she said, are bankrolling the new 
Santa Ana shop. 
</P>
<P>
But while she thought she was getting into "a nice, quiet business," she has 
found out otherwise. On the Loma Linda store's opening day, she said, the owner 
of a local mortuary stormed into the shop, demanding to know the identity of 
Hillmark's casket suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"When my husband asked him to leave, he said, 'No,' " she recalled. "He left 
when we were dialing the sheriff's office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs Tied to Caskets 
</P>
<P>
Relationships with local vendors have been equally difficult. Casket 
manufacturers traditionally sell their wares wholesale directly to funeral 
homes. George Lemke, executive director of the Casket Manufacturers Assn., said 
wholesale casket sales in the United States range between $830 million and $850 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral homes mark up casket prices to cover a wide variety of operating costs. 
Because the coffin is the major piece of merchandise funeral homes sell, many 
tie all the overhead costs to the price of the casket, Jeanne Gilbert of the 
National Funeral Directors Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
The markups are necessary, Gilbert said, because funeral homes do not recover 
their operating costs through service charges on such items as chapel and 
limousine use alone. Casket manufacturers will not divulge their wholesale 
prices, and markups differ from establishment to establishment, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
"For an adult funeral, where a casket is used and there's a visitation, the 
return is less than 10%," said Lemke of the Casket Manufacturers Assn. "The 
average operating cost for a funeral home may be as high as $2,200 per adult 
funeral. If a funeral director fully recovered operating costs in service 
charges, the casket markups would not be nearly as high." 
</P>
<P>
Because funeral homes are casket companies' major market, funeral directors 
wield a powerful influence over their suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Delivery 
</P>
<P>
Inland Casket Manufacturing Co. in Riverside stopped supplying coffins to 
Hillmark, Sheralee Nyswonger said, when local funeral directors found out about 
the firms' relationship. "Funeral directors were no longer buying from them 
because they were selling to us," she said. Peter Fishering, vice president of 
Inland, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Riverside trucking company made only one casket delivery for 
Hillmark before pulling out. Ron Bredelis, owner of Inland Valley 
Transportation Co., said his firm transports bodies for mortuaries and does not 
usually deliver caskets. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it one time," Bredelis said. "I had heard it was pretty controversial 
with the funeral directors. Our business is not transporting caskets. We 
transport deceased human beings. So I decided it was better for our company not 
to do business with them." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Sheralee Nyswonger removes all labels from the coffins she sells and 
refuses to divulge her list of suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so tired of getting beat up," she said. "The customers like you. 
Everyone else just wants to cut you to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Other casket retailers have come and gone, and the funeral industry contends 
that consumers have turned their backs on such businesses. Casket retailers 
have blamed the funeral industry for their failures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires Price List 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the FTC enacted trade regulations demanding that funeral directors 
furnish their customers with detailed lists that break down services rendered 
and prices charged. The regulations also prohibit the funeral industry from 
misrepresenting to customers the legal requirements for burial. Embalming, for 
example, is not necessary under most circumstances, according to Ra'ouf 
Abdullah, a staff attorney for the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 rules are under review, Abdullah said, and handling fees are at the 
heart of the review. 
</P>
<P>
"Some parties feel that handling fees are not a matter for the commission to 
review, that it's a matter of the business discretion of the industry," 
Abdullah said. "Other parties believe that handling fees are a device to 
inhibit competition in the marketing of caskets." 
</P>
<P>
Hast, the trade magazine publisher and partner in a Los Angeles mortuary, said 
his funeral home charges a handling fee "in the $100 category" if the casket 
used is not purchased through his own firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no quarrel with a family who goes out and buys a casket somewhere 
else," Hast said. "Just don't come and impose your wants on a funeral director 
for his chapel or embalming or other arrangements. Stay home and do it all 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
It is that kind of attitude that has made life difficult for Willis Webb, owner 
of Illinois Casket Co. in Chicago. Webb opened his coffin manufacturing firm 
five years ago and sold his wares to the area's funeral homes. A year later, he 
opened a retail outlet, and his sales to funeral homes dried up. 
</P>
<P>
But he is able to stay in business, he says, in part because he supplies his 
own caskets. In addition, there are so many funeral directors in Chicago, Webb 
said, that "there's too much competition for them to solidify against someone 
who's selling caskets to the public" by raising handling fees as a group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disliked by Directors 
</P>
<P>
"We get repeat business from people who have used us before and come back," he 
said. "But the funeral directors here totally dislike us and think we're the 
most terrible thing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Nyswongers have been aided by the intense competition in the burial 
industry in Southern California. Customers, they say, are the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
One longtime Santa Ana resident visited Hillmark recently, shopping for a 
casket for her ailing mother. When she buried her husband four years ago, she 
said, she felt "raped" by the experience, by pushy sales tactics and high 
prices. Hillmark, she said, "is so much more pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
"My mother says, 'Go out and save what you can,' " the woman recounted. "She 
says, 'You have to spend the money on living, not on goodbys. Get a price list, 
remember the colors and we'll talk about it tomorrow. But no purple. And no 
green.' "

MANISCHEWITZ SETTLES CLAIMS, SAYS IT'S NO LONGER FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
B. Manischewitz Co., a New Jersey maker of matzo and other kosher food 
products, said Tuesday that it has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle claims 
by a Beverly Hills investment firm relating to an aborted, $44.6-million buyout 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz also officially took itself off the sale block, saying it had 
informed Shearson Lehman Hutton, its investment bank, that it was "no longer 
interested in acquisition proposals." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co., a Beverly 
Hills firm that tried for months to buy Manischewitz, apparently compromised in 
accepting the $1.5 million. It had argued that it was entitled to a 
$2.4-million "cancellation fee," while Manischewitz contended that it didn't 
owe the firm anything. 
</P>
<P>
After friendly negotiations during which it seemed that a deal was all but 
certain, Manischewitz and Levine Tessler suddenly soured on each other late 
last month. That was after Levine Tessler sweetened its bid to $841 a share to 
top that of rival kosher foods maker National Foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Looking Into Alleged Violations 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz, based in Jersey City, accused the Beverly Hills firm of dragging 
its feet. Levine Tessler, for its part, countered that Manischewitz was 
unwilling to disclose information about the possible effects of a long-running 
grand jury investigation into alleged antitrust violations in the kosher food 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 4 letter mailed to shareholders, Manischewitz said it informed 
Levine Tessler in mid-July that the investigation "had intensified (and) now 
probably encompassed most, if not all, of the company's products." Several 
company officials have testified before a New Jersey grand jury looking into 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
On July 31, Levine Tessler said it would not proceed with its acquisition. 
Since then, the two companies have been scrambling to reach a settlement to 
avoid going to court. 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz also said it settled two shareholder suits related to the failed 
merger effort. The company said the shareholders agreed to drop those suits in 
exchange for Manischewitz's agreement not to oppose a court award of up to 
$375,000 for the plaintiffs' legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
All terms of the settlement are subject to approval by the Court of Common 
Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio.

Sea Containers Stock Surges: The stock price for Sea Containers Ltd. surged 
after a bidder pursuing the equipment-leasing and shipping concern raised its 
unsolicited takeover offer by about $200 million to more than $1 billion. The 
bidder is Temple Holdings Ltd., a company jointly owned by Stena Holding AG, a 
Swedish shipping concern, and Tiphook PLC, a British concern that provides 
containers to the shipping industry. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 
Hamilton, Bermuda-based Sea Containers rose $4.125 a share to $67.125. Sea 
Containers had said last week that it was considering recapitalizing as an 
alternative to the original takeover offer.

AUTO SALES CLIMB 8.2% IN EARLY AUGUST 
</P>

<P>
Sales of cars and light trucks rose 8.2% in early August, compared to last 
year, partly because of buying by consumers seeking to avoid price increases 
for 1990 cars, the companies reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles assembled by the eight major auto makers in the United States sold at 
an average daily rate of 33,660 during the Aug. 1-10 period this year, compared 
to a rate of 31,118 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales rose 7.4% and truck sales were up 9.4% from the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, the Big Three auto makers have outlined tentative price 
hikes for cars in the model year that generally begins in October. General 
Motors Corp. said its tentative prices will be about 3.4% above 1989 levels; 
Ford Motor Co. said its prices will be about 4.8% higher, and Chrysler Corp.'s 
1990 prices will be up about 5% from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said some of the increases are due to costs stemming from 
government requirements that they install passive restraint systems -- air bags 
or automatic seat belts -- in 1990 model cars. 
</P>
<P>
Some consumers may be pushing their 1990 car buying plans up a few months to 
miss the price boosts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in all probability there are people buying a little earlier than 
usual, but not many," said analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He said the picture would become clearer later in the month as more sales 
reports are issued. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers also were lured by incentives, which auto makers would like to drop 
during the coming model year. 
</P>
<P>
"Car sales are a little stronger than I expected," said analyst David Healy of 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York. "I would say it is the attractive 
rebates on the '89s and the fear of the costs of air bags." 
</P>
<P>
For Jan. 1 through Aug. 10, car and truck sales were 3.6% behind last year's 
pace, falling to an average daily rate of 38,063 this year from a rate of 
39,500 last year. Car sales were off 4.8% and truck sales were down 1.5% during 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
GM car sales during the 10-day August period dropped 2.7% to a daily rate of 
9,368 this year from 9,631 a year earlier. GM's sales for the year to date were 
8.6% behind last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's early August car sales rose to a rate of 6,826 a day, up 17.6% from a 
rate of 5,804 in the year-earlier period. For the year-to-date period, Ford's 
car sales were down 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's early August car sales rose 5.6% to a daily rate of 2,835 this year 
from 2,685 daily a year earlier. Chrysler's car sales for the year to date were 
14.1% behind last year's pace.

GENERAL DYNAMICS PICKED TO LAUNCH SATELLITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a deal that could ultimately be worth up to $550 million, General Dynamics 
has been selected to provide rocket launch services for up to 10 Navy 
communications satellites, the biggest boost yet to its bid to become a force 
in the growing commercial space launch business. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the sale, General Dynamics will provide at least one Atlas 
rocket costing about $55 million to launch a Navy communications satellite into 
orbit in 1992 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. General Dynamics will be a 
subcontractor to Hughes Aircraft of El Segundo, which will build the 
$172-million satellite as well as manage the launch. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Navy has committed to buy just one Ultra High Frequency Follow-On 
satellite, the contract calls for up to nine additional satellite launches 
through 1995, bringing the contract's potential value to General Dynamics to 
$550 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although the expectation is that expendable launch vehicles will be used, 
Hughes Aircraft spokesman Richard Dore cautioned that the Navy has the option 
of using future space shuttle missions to place some of the other UHF 
satellites, if ordered. 
</P>
<P>
To win the contract, General Dynamics beat out Martin Marietta Astronautics of 
Denver and industry leader Arianespace of France. With McDonnell Douglas Space 
Systems of Huntington Beach, the companies are the biggest players in the 
$1-billion-per-year commercial launch industry. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the deal will propel General Dynamics to a level equal to its 
competitors in the U.S. commercial rocket launch business, a market that 
developed in the aftermath of the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. 
The 10 Navy launches would bring the total Atlas launches in the works to 28, 
of which 17 are purely commercial contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, however, will result in minimal additional jobs at General 
Dynamics Space Systems' manufacturing facilities in San Diego, general manager 
Alan Lovelace said Tuesday. That's because the company has been steadily 
gearing up for the private launches over the past two years, investing $300 
million in expanded facilities and increasing payroll to more than 4,700 from 
3,000 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for (General Dynamics), in terms of the size of the 
contract plus that it was sought after by other contractors, including Martin 
Marietta," said George Podrasky, an aerospace analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in 
Chicago. "They had assumed a lot of risk in going ahead with the commercial 
Atlas, and the chance they took proved to be the correct one. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Challenger disaster, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration suspended all placement of commercial satellites by the manned 
space craft. Before the moratorium, NASA bought rockets from aerospace 
manufacturers and managed all launches. But with NASA out of the picture, a new 
market dominated by private manufacturers was created. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gaining Strength 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, which launches its spacecraft from French Guiana in South America, 
had a head start in commercial rocket business, getting started in 1980. 
Arianespace thus far has launched 41 payloads in 24 launches from French Guiana 
and has a backlog to launch 33 payloads. 
</P>
<P>
But McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta and now General Dynamics are gaining 
strength in the market. The first U.S. commercial launch is scheduled for Aug. 
25, when a Hughes telecommunications satellite built for British Space 
Broadcasting will be launched from Cape Canaveral atop a $50-million McDonnell 
Douglas Delta rocket. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems, which employs 8,000 at its Huntington Beach 
manufacturing facility, has eight additional commercial launches scheduled 
through 1991, spokesman Tom Williams said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Astronautics Group, which employs 10,000 at its Denver 
manufacturing base, has contracted to launch six payloads in five launches 
aboard its Titan rockets, the first of which, an Intelsat VI telecommunications 
satellite, is scheduled for lift off this fall, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.

New Court for American Continental Case: U.S. District Judge Charles Hardy 
agreed to oversee portions of American Continental Corp.'s bankruptcy, citing a 
conflict in federal laws were the case to have been left wholly with the 
Bankruptcy Court. The conflict stems from the issue of whether Chapter 11 laws 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code supersede or are subject to Title 12 laws, which 
govern banking institutions, said Phillip Mitchell, an attorney for several 
secured creditors. Hardy's decision moves the bankruptcy cases involving the 
Phoenix-based holding company and 11 subsidiaries of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
in Irvine to federal court from Bankruptcy Court.

PEOPLE: MACY'S CALIFORNIA CHAIRMAN TO HEAD BULLOCK'S DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Kahn, chairman and chief executive of Macy's California in San Francisco 
since 1985, has been named chairman and chief executive of the Atlanta-based 
division of R. H. Macy &amp; Co. that oversees Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces Robert N. Friedman, 48, who was appointed vice chairman for 
merchandising for Macy's Northeast division, based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Finkelstein, the 34-year-old son of Macy's Chairman Edward S. 
Finkelstein, was promoted to chairman and chief executive of Macy's California. 
He has been senior vice president-merchandising for the 25-store chain. He 
joined the chain in September, 1977, as part of the executive training squad 
and worked his way up through the merchandising ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Another son of Finkelstein, Mitchell, runs the retailer's Hong Kong office. 
</P>
<P>
For Kahn, 43, the move to Atlanta will be a homecoming. Before joining Macy's 
California, he spent four years as president of the Davison's division (now 
Macy's South). 
</P>
<P>
Kahn joined Macy's in 1975 as a merchandise administrator in New York and 
worked in various merchandising posts. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-store division that he now heads, called Macy's South/Bullock's, was 
created last year after Macy's bought Bullock's from Federated Department 
Stores and merged it with the Atlanta division. It encompasses 25 Macy's stores 
in the Southeast and Texas plus 22 Bullock's department stores in Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Diego counties, Las Vegas and Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The changes occur as Macy's has been suffering from lackluster sales. MARTHA

WHO'S IN CHARGE AT STAAR? DEPENDS WHOM YOU ASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people just don't know when to quit -- even when they've been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Thomas R. Waggoner, founder and president of Staar Surgical Co., 
dumped all the members on his company's board of directors except himself. But 
the four ousted directors fought back, firing Waggoner and locking him out of 
the company's Monrovia offices. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute came to a head last week when the board opposed Waggoner's plans to 
approve an $11-million licensing and sales agreement with Irvine-based Chiron 
Opthalmics. So Waggoner, who controls Staar through his ownership of the 
company's preferred stock, dissolved the board and replaced it with a new 
version that included himself, his wife, Patricia, and a vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
However, the board refused to go along, terminating Waggoner and changing the 
locks at Staar's offices. The board also tried and failed to take back 
Waggoner's preferred stock that was given to him in return for his personal 
guarantee of $7 million in company debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Conduct Business by Phone 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge backed Waggoner and 
issued a temporary order allowing the executive back into his offices. The 
court had also earlier blocked efforts to rescind the issue of Waggoner's 
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach the ousted directors or their attorneys were not successful. 
</P>
<P>
While the dispute was being heard in court, it was not clear who was running 
Staar, which makes products used primarily in cataract surgery. Waggoner, who 
was not available for comment, was reportedly camped outside Staar's offices 
Monday and Tuesday trying to conduct business on a company phone with a 75-foot 
cord. 
</P>
<P>
At Chiron, executives were also wondering who was in charge. "We're waiting to 
hear like everyone else," said a company spokesman.

Angeles Corp., the Los Angeles investment management company, has announced 
that two of its top executives have withdrawn from day-to-day operations as 
officers, but continue as directors. Lawrence J. Winston of Garden City, N.Y., 
and Richard E. Landau of New York, have resigned as vice chairmen and as 
members of the Angeles executive committee to pursue other business interests. 
Winston and Landau were founders and principals of the privately owned Quinoco 
Cos., a group of Denver-based oil and gas companies that were combined with 
Angeles Corp. in 1984 in a diversification move by both firms. They became 
directors and officers of Angeles at that time.

UNION WARNS UNITED PILOTS OF 'DIFFICULT CHOICES' SOON 
</P>

The Air Line Pilots Assn. told its United Airlines members Tuesday to be ready 
for "difficult choices" ahead after reports that the union and the airline's 
parent company were discussing a plan that could include an employee-owned 
stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to United ALPA members, Chairman Frederick C. Dubinski said UAL 
Corp. -- which has received a $5.4-billion, $240-a-share takeover proposal from 
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis -- undoubtedly will be bought out by 
somebody. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, whether you like it or not, you and all the other employees are going 
to help pay for it," Dubinski said. "The only choice is whether we buy it for 
someone else or ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
He said United pilots may have to "act rapidly, decisively and conclusively to 
assure our survival and prosperity," noting that acquisition by an outsider 
likely would mean a leveraged buyout that could saddle the company with loads 
of new debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Inevitable' Decisions 
</P>
<P>
A leveraged buyout is an acquisition financed mainly by borrowed funds that are 
repaid with the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
"We must watch this situation very closely, ensuring that we have all the 
information we need to make the difficult choices that are inevitable," 
Dubinski said. 
</P>
<P>
The union has only two choices, Dubinski said -- "concessions to an outsider or 
investment in the airline by the employees. There is no good third choice." 
</P>
<P>
UAL stock closed down $4.375 a share to $254.125 on Tuesday in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Several news reports indicated that ALPA and UAL officials met during the 
weekend to discuss plans for either a management-employee buyout or a 
recapitalization that would put a big enough block of UAL stock in an employee 
stock ownership plan to help thwart any hostile takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of UAL and ALPA refused to comment Tuesday on whether meetings 
were held during the weekend or on reports of the purported plans. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls seeking comment Tuesday from two unions representing other 
United employees -- the International Brotherhood of Machinists and the Assn. 
of Flight Attendants -- were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Dubinski said in his letter that the level of contribution to any employee 
stock ownership plan by the pilots would depend on the number of employees and 
employee groups participating. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the declared interest of the other employees, we may need a great 
level of participation or a slight level," his letter read. "It would make good 
sense for you to be financially prepared for the worst." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Interested 
</P>
<P>
United's pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying the company 
and in 1987 proposed a $4.5-billion plan to buy the airline from its 
then-parent, Allegis Corp. Last week, ALPA officials said its advisers were 
being consulted about the Davis bid. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Davis, New York-based Pan Am Corp. has expressed interest in a 
possible merger with UAL, and there has been speculation that a bid for UAL may 
be made by the New York corporate buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Marckesano, an analyst with the Philadelphia investment firm of Janney 
Montgomery Scott Inc., said a deal involving UAL management and its employees 
would eliminate fears in Congress and the Transportation Department that the 
airline would be stripped of valuable assets, as might happen with a leveraged 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"With that kind of plan, you would assure continuation of UAL as a strong 
airline," Marckesano said, referring to a management-labor buyout. "It would 
create labor peace, which would be pretty important in the future."

SBA REVAMPS ITS RULES ON MINORITY BIDDING ON U.S. CONTRACTS

The Small Business Administration on Tuesday overhauled its minority set-aside 
program in response to the Wedtech bribery and influence-peddling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations, effective immediately, put into effect legislation signed nine 
months ago by President Reagan. They are designed to minimize political 
influence on the agency's 21-year-old program under which firms owned by 
blacks, Latinos, Asians, Indians and economically disadvantaged women are given 
preference in the awarding of government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes: 
</P>
<P>
* The program director will be a career employee of the agency, rather than a 
political appointee. SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter named Erline Patrick, a 
former staff aide to the Senate Small Business Committee, to the post. "The 
person in charge will not have to respond as much to the political pressures," 
Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
* Firms that misrepresent their status as minority-owned will be subject to 
stiffer penalties. The maximum fine was increased from $50,000 to $500,000, and 
the top jail term from five years to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
* For the first time, competitive bidding is required among minority-owned 
firms for manufacturing contracts over $5 million and product and service 
contracts over $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The time a firm may get special preference was lengthened from seven years to 
nine years, but companies will be expected to derive a steadily decreasing 
percentage of their revenues from contracts awarded under the program. 
</P>
<P>
* Owners of eligible firms must have a net worth of less than $250,000, 
excluding equity in their homes or businesses, when they enter the program. The 
old standard was $750,000, including home or business equity. 
</P>
<P>
* The agency must rule on applications within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, at a news conference, said about 3,000 firms participate. She said the 
net worth requirement and the initiation of competitive bidding may discourage 
new participants, but she said she hoped that the deadline for decisions would 
boost participation. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress passed the law last year, Sen. Dale Bumpers, (D-Ark.), chairman 
of the Senate Small Business Committee, said it was aimed at preventing the 
recurrence of Wedtech-type scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Wedtech Corp., a military contractor in New York's south Bronx, was awarded 
more than $250 million in no-bid contracts in just four years but became the 
subject of five criminal investigations.

BUILDING IN CHILD SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Calabasas businessman Robert Sacks decided he needed to take a 
hard look at child safety in his home -- and beyond -- after his 2-year-old 
son, Brandon, almost electrocuted himself by sticking a nail into a wall 
socket. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had been pretty careful," Sacks recalled last week. But the 
accident "made me aware we had a problem in the house. I started looking into 
child safety in the home. But I found no information, no booklets, no agency in 
existence dealing" with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Citing figures showing that last year almost 8,000 of the nation's children age 
14 and younger were killed and 50,000 were permanently disabled in accidents, 
Sacks asked: "Why do homes have to be a deathtrap for children? Let's do 
something with foresight rather than after-sight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better and Cheaper 
</P>
<P>
He explained that it is better and cheaper to add safety features while 
building a home rather than adding them later. 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely the point of three new Calabasas houses to be displayed in the 
upcoming California Showcase '89, an exhibit emphasizing "baby safe" 
architecture, interior design and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Among safety designs featured in the homes will be: bull-nosed (rounded) wall 
corners and fireplace mantels; staircases with rounded dual railings -- one for 
adults, a lower one for children; and intermediate landings so children, if 
they do fall, tumble a few steps, not the length of an entire stairway. 
</P>
<P>
The homes also have tempered glass windows that won't shatter if accidentally 
struck; fireplaces with protective glass; oven doors out of a child's reach; 
temperature-controlled water faucets; wall sockets with sliding safety panels; 
and special (GFCI) wiring systems that shut off the current if an object is 
stuck in a socket. 
</P>
<P>
The homes have such exterior safety features as balcony walls 44 inches high, 
too high for a small child to scale. Some models have wrought iron balconies 
with rounded tops and bottoms and rails no farther apart than four inches, so 
children can't get their heads stuck between them. 
</P>
<P>
The models will include safety fences; covers and warning systems to help 
prevent swimming pool accidents; and landscaping with low-toxicity trees and 
plants and non-protruding lawn sprinkler heads. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks hopes the show homes, which will be open for tours from Sept. 17-Oct. 15, 
will "teach and educate American builders" that child safety measures can be 
incorporated into homes "without compromising the integrity of the design." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been an activist, but I felt there was a real need for this," he 
said, explaining that he went to several Los Angeles builders, asking them to 
put up the models for exhibit and later for private sale. They refused because 
of potential legal "liability" problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Saddletree Development in Calabasas agreed to the project and is building 
the three homes: a desert design, a contemporary unit and a Spanish model. 
After the showcase, the homes will go on the market for $1.5 million to $1.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Safety Awareness 
</P>
<P>
California Showcase '89 will benefit the nonprofit group that Sacks has 
founded, the National Institute of Children's Environments (NICE), which puts 
on educational programs for builders and developers to promote child safety 
awareness. The group is a chapter of the National Child Safety Council (NCSC) 
in Jackson, Mich., the 34-year-old children's safety organization that 
initiated the national Missing Children Milk Carton Program. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't proclaim to be an expert on this," Sacks admitted. "We conducted 
interviews with mothers, safety experts, doctors and the architects came up 
with their own designs, based on what we've learned. These homes are designed 
to be baby-safe, not baby-proof. . . . There is no such thing as a baby-proof 
house. And nothing replaces parental supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Programs from other children's safety groups also will be assisted by the 
showcase, and each organization will have outside booths to display educational 
materials and exhibits. Participants will include the Los Angeles Area Child 
Passenger Safety Assn., the Drowning Prevention Foundation, the National Kid 
Safe Project and the Alicia Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Besides NICE and NCSC, the showcase presenters include the Southern California 
and California South Coast chapters of the International Furnishings and Design 
Assn. and Valley Magazine. Tickets ordered before Sept. 1 are $10 per person; 
$15 after that. Call (818) 595-7777. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very unique and something that's been needed for a long, long time," 
Tony Horton, NCSC vice president, said of the showcase. "It is the beginning of 
a two-year pilot program. We're planning to have them in different parts of the 
country. We hope to have one next spring, maybe in Houston and the fall in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Parents Can Do 
</P>
<P>
Although Sacks and Horton conceded that few of the 30,000 anticipated showcase 
tour visitors can afford houses as pricey as the Calabasas models, the 
exhibit's intent is to give them tips to increase child safety in their own 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
At little cost a parent can, for example, install safety wall socket covers or 
change doorstops to one-piece plastic models instead of units with removable 
tops that can be swallowed by kids, Sacks said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to go home to their own homes and do the little things they 
never thought of," Horton said. "They might not be able to afford a lot of the 
more expensive work, but they can learn, for instance, to move the hair dryer 
to a spot where the cord won't reach to the bathtub. We'll have exhibits of all 
sorts of simple things that can be done." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based architects who designed the homes are Lise Matthews, 
Barry Robles and Bahram Nashat. They were selected not only for their 
architectural expertise but also their concern for child safety in the home. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless accidents can be avoided," said Matthews, the mother of two children. 
"Our children are too precious to risk their safety through lack of careful 
design."

Peter Langevin, editor of Magical Blend, a 45,000-circulation San 
Francisco-based New Age magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The dolphin movement was born two decades ago with the writings of neurologist 
John C. Lilly, who believed dolphins are smarter than people. Fueled by TV 
shows and the environmental, animal rights, and new-age spiritual movements 
since, the dolphin movement in the past year has "just exploded -- we can't 
keep up with it," said Toni Frohoff of Playa del Rey, who publishes the Dolphin 
Data Base, a list of 3,000 people and organizations involved in dolphin 
projects. At least 300 of them involve attempts at inter-species communication 
despite the lack of scientific evidence that it is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing their brains are larger and that they see in a 3-D sonar way has led a 
large portion of New Age people to look to them for spiritual inspiration and 
hope," Langevin said. 
</P>
<P>
Several spiritual mediums claim to "channel" messages of peace or self-worship 
from real dolphins or the "dolphin consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Neville Rowe of Arizona, who sometimes makes clicking dolphin sounds during his 
public or private channeling sessions, drew the wrath of other dolphin lovers 
recently when he claimed in an article in Magical Blend that dolphins told him 
they volunteer for amusement parks and dolphin swim centers as a way to 
communicate with humans. 
</P>
<P>
Anecdotes of those who have been "dolphinized" often concern telepathy, stories 
of healing, sudden insight, or a "ginger ale" feeling of familial or erotic 
love when swimming with dolphins -- 350-pound animals with quick reflexes and 
permanent smiles, who mate and play frequently and often approach people to 
stare or click at them. 
</P>
<P>
"When they look you in the eye, you feel you've been seen down to the bottom of 
your soul," said Beth Gawaine of Maui, a retired city planner who has made an 
informal study of individual dolphins in Australia. "They're very good 
Buddhists. They're very here, now." 
</P>
<P>
After being in the ocean with dolphins, Gawaine said, "People come out weeping 
. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Others -- including some psychologists -- have shed tears of rejection after 
encounters with dolphins who weren't interested in them, said Lloyd Borguss of 
Dolphins Plus, the first swim-with-dolphins center, which opened 8 years ago in 
Grassy Key, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"The dolphin is going to do what it wants to do. This can be a big shock to 
your ego. They won't go to a person who is up tight," Borguss said. Mostly, 
they prefer to play with children and women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like other programs, Dolphins Plus turns away a third of its applicants and has 
seen increasing requests from psychologists, doctors and management consultants 
bringing groups of autistic children, emotionally disturbed teens and business 
executives to swim with the captive dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Data Base's Frohoff, however, wild dolphin encounters have 
become "the big trend" within the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people start out with captive dolphins, and get tired of it. They don't 
feel good about it and move on," said Joan Ocean, an Oahu-based counseling 
psychologist who organizes encounters in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
But in the warm waters off Kauai, devoted humans are "getting to be too much 
for the poor creatures," said Dan Moriarty, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
ranger at Kilauea Point, near where large pods of dolphins congregate year 
round. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Behavior 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, he said, any encounter that results in a change in the dolphins' 
natural behavior constitutes a violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
1972, which is punishable with fines of up to $10,000. One Kauai resident who 
pleaded guilty to dolphin harassment after driving his inflatable boat through 
a pod of about 30 dolphins was recently fined $500 and sentenced to spend 200 
hours educating others about the Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, which has been escalating for two years, peaked June 26, when 
enthusiasts surrounded a pod of about 60 mostly spinner and some Pacific 
bottlenose dolphins at Kaupea Beach off the western coast of Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
"Two kayaks came out with a dog and went into the pod," Moriarty said. "Then a 
charter fishing boat discharged 10 snorkelers into the pod. From the shore, 
seven to ten swimmers came out and a research boat was there. So they virtually 
had the pod surrounded." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the intense interest and 10 years of research on dolphins, 
academics have yet to make good on Lilly's prediction that communication with 
the bottle-nose dolphin would be achieved before 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got myths, legends and stories. They're fun, interesting, enjoyable to 
listen to. But when you get down to objective science, where's the proof, 
where's the meat?" asks Dennis Kelly, director of the Coastal Dolphin Survey 
Project and professor of marine biology at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
While dolphins' abilities to follow complex directions from hand signals are 
impressive, researchers have yet to decipher the dolphins' own whistles and 
creaks, according to Lou Herman, a psychologist at the University of Hawaii, 
perhaps the nation's most widely respected dolphin communication researcher. In 
his opinion, the mammals are not much smarter than apes or chimpanzees. 
</P>
<P>
The dolphin's sonar, which some believe is used to stun prey, could account for 
the tingly "ginger-ale" feeling that swimmers report when dolphins are near, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no evidence of telepathy," Herman said. "I don't think there ever will 
be evidence. It's just another fantasy that represents people's hopes rather 
than objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, believers seek and find their own evidence. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. on a recent Thursday, Robert Macknowski, director of Project 
Interlock, an international group documenting dolphin encounters in the wild, 
took the microphone of a pleasure cruise headed up Kauai's Na Pali Coast, a 
well-known dolphin habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Silver hair flapping around his crystal ear ring, he asked a group of 
unsuspecting tourists to help him call dolphins by visualizing them leaping 
into the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spinner Dolphins 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen minutes later by his watch, a dozen spinner dolphins arrived in pairs, 
chasing the bow of the boat. Straight ahead, a lone spinner dolphin shot into 
the air, completed a triple gainer, and slipped neatly back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen swimmers with masks and fins clambered into the water. 
</P>
<P>
But under the surface, the dolphins already had fled, leaving only rays of 
light to sweep the empty ocean floor like klieg lights after the show is done.

BOX OFFICE COLD TO STALLONE'S 'LOCK UP' ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sylvester Stallone's new movie "Lock Up" is sinking like a stone at theaters, 
renewing speculation that the actor -- among Hollywood's highest-paid stars -- 
may be losing some of his appeal with American audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Lock Up," in which Stallone plays a prison inmate trying to outwit a cruel 
warden, opened Aug. 4 to ticket sales of about $6 million. Last weekend, ticket 
sales for the $24-million film dropped an ominous 45%. Industry analysts say 
that the film will top out at about $25 million at its current pace -- a major 
disappointment for a star whose action films have grossed more than $2 billion 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Exit polls taken by CinemaScore, a private industry polling service, show that 
Stallone's audience has skewed dramatically older in recent years and that not 
even his hard-core fans were thrilled with the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"34% of (the "Lock Up" audience) were 35 or older, that's sad," said Ed Mintz, 
president of CinemaScore. "Stallone got old and so did his fans." 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said that only 36% of the people polled after "Lock Up" said "they 
couldn't wait" to see it. For a Stallone film, he said, the "couldn't wait" 
figure should have been closer to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
The weak debut of "Lock Up" comes one year after Stallone's "Rambo: First Blood 
Part III" opened in U.S. theaters to what were -- when weighed against 
expectations -- disappointing ticket sales. Taking in about $54 million 
domestically, the movie grossed roughly one-third the amount of its 
predecessor, "Rambo: First Blood Part II." The second "Rambo" film, released in 
1985, grossed more than $150 million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone has reportedly been paid as much as $15 million for a picture and, 
despite the drop in business for his films here, he has continued to be a major 
attraction for moviegoers overseas. "Rambo III," for example, took in $100 
million in foreign ticket sales. "He's a huge star overseas -- the numbers back 
that up," said one executive connected with his films. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone's publicist, Paul Bloch, contends that the actor is just as big a star 
in this country. Stallone's recent appearances on TV talk shows unleashed a 
flood of fan mail, Bloch noted, adding that the star annually receives almost a 
million pieces of mail from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Carolco, which co-produced the film with Stallone's company, White 
Eagle, declined comment on "Lock Up's" opening. (Because of foreign and video 
pre-sales, Carolco stands to profit from the film despite weak U.S. ticket 
sales.) 
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview before "Lock Up" opened, Carolco co-chairman Andrew 
Vajna said that Stallone's U.S. following remains strong. "There's no question 
about that, Sly is a movie star," Vajna said. "When he walks down a street, a 
crowd forms." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the domestic performance of "Rambo III," analysts note that Stallone's 
biggest obstacle is finding an audience for his other roles, like the prison 
inmate he plays in "Lock Up." 
</P>
<P>
"He's really established himself in two areas -- Rambo-type movies and 
Rocky-type movies," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., a 
box-office service for exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has expressed a desire to move away from those two series, Stallone 
has not had much success whenever he has departed from hard action films. The 
more sensitive "Over the Top," in which Stallone played a man trying to regain 
the respect of his son and win a world arm-wrestling championship at the same 
time, had a weak $5.1 million opening in 1987 and completed its theatrical run 
with less than $16 million in grosses. And who can forget his musical 
performance in the romantic comedy "Rhinestone" opposite Dolly Parton? 
</P>
<P>
His hard action films have all opened much stronger than "Lock Up." "Rambo III" 
opened at $16.7 million, "Rambo II" opened at $25.5 million and "Rocky IV" 
opened at nearly $20 million, according to figures compiled by Entertainment 
Data Inc. "Cobra," an action film in the "Rambo" vein, opened at $15.6 million. 
(Stallone has already committed to doing "Rocky V" and "Rambo IV" 
installments.) 
</P>
<P>
Stallone will get another shot at a non-"Rambo," non-"Rocky" movie in "Tango 
and Cash," a Warner Bros. production that Bloch describes as a buddy film. 
</P>
<P>
Krier also contends, however, that "Lock Up" suffered from a badly timed 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a fall picture," Krier said. By opening in August, "they went up 
against a lot of big action pictures." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Tri-Star, which distributes "Lock Up" in the United States, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Jack Mathews contributed to this story.

A SOVIET BUREAUCRAT MAKES 'CONNECTIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At intermission, "A Man With Connections" seems dead in the water at the Matrix 
Theatre. Yes, Alexander Gelman's play displays the new freedom of the Soviet 
theater to point to problems in the system. But its central situation feels 
canned. A Moscow bureaucrat's wife berates him for being responsible for the 
industrial accident that crippled their son. Where can this play go but down? 
</P>
<P>
Surprise: It's got resources. If Gelman at first seems to be playing back 
Arthur Miller's "All My Sons" at a very slow speed, it eventually becomes clear 
that he has something more like Moliere in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Moliere loves oversized zanies who surrender themselves so totally to some 
ruling appetite (for gold, say, or for strictly fresh virgins) that they become 
a function of it. Galen's bureaucrat (Charles Hallahan) is one of these 
incorrigibles. 
</P>
<P>
His thing is manipulation. By kissing up to his superiors and frowning down on 
his staff, he has leveraged himself into a good job, a nice apartment and a 
satisfactory wife -- when she's not drinking -- played by Carolyn Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the biggest challenge of his career. His son's accident has caused 
his wife to decide that he's a terrible person. How can he get her back on the 
team? 
</P>
<P>
It is not a virtue of Gelman's script that the first half plays like soap opera 
-- all recrimination and heavy silences. But once we see that Gelman's real 
game is wittier than that, we start listening. Was ever woman in this humor 
re-won? 
</P>
<P>
Almost. Our hero is a clever fellow. Charles Hallahan makes him a chunky, 
red-faced guy who would fit in on any building site. A real man, his workers 
would say of Hallahan's bureaucrat -- a man of instinct. And they would be 
right. The instinct to save his own neck. 
</P>
<P>
Like Richard III, there's nothing to which Hallahan's character won't stoop in 
order to conquer. As a Russian, he is particularly skilled at self-abasement. 
You're right, he tearily tells his wife. I'm a fraud, a zero, an empty mask! 
But I'll do anything to change! I'll even quit my job! 
</P>
<P>
By the way, he adds -- I got promoted today. 
</P>
<P>
Oh? This information brings an interesting new look into his wife's eyes 
(actress Seymour shows us the look) and the conversation takes on a practical 
tone that wasn't there before. These two have been married for a long time, and 
old arrangements die hard. 
</P>
<P>
The next half hour or so of the play is about that, and it's delicious. At the 
end, though, the play goes back to being "All My Sons." And one has to admit 
that the curtain scene packs a punch, with our man of connections taking a 
shaming call from a character whom we had almost forgotten about. 
</P>
<P>
Like his hero, Gelman can create an effective moment -- all the more effective, 
here, for being so quiet. Whether the moment is organic is another question. 
Written just at the end of the Brezhnev era, "A Man With Connections" seems to 
have been written for all markets, both for playgoers who like their stories to 
have a moral and for playgoer who holds that morality is what we talk about 
after we pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
The script admits both readings, depending on where you catch it, and 
Kristoffer Siegel-Tabori's staging respects its ambivalence -- or, if you will, 
its shiftiness. The acting, however, is specific. Hallahan doesn't give us some 
imaginary Russian, but this particular bloke, full of himself and also sick of 
himself. Meanwhile Seymour, in the far less grateful role of the wife, 
negotiates that character's sodden silences and her squalls of violent emotion 
like an expert sailor. 
</P>
<P>
Designers Deborah Raymond and Dorian Vernacchio put the play on the same 
plain-pipe-rack set used for the other show in Actors for Themselves' current 
repertory series at the Matrix, Larry Shue's "Wenceslas Square." The pairing is 
not accidental. Shue gives the outsiders' view of a society where the 
bureaucrats tell the people what to do, while Gelman gives an inside guess as 
to the human cost of being a bureaucrat. Too bad he takes so long to get to the 
point.

company to 4.6% of Vons' 38.7 million shares, from about 7.3%. The Greenwich, 
Conn.-based investment firm said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that it has sold more than 1 million shares at prices ranging from 
$18.83 to $21.20 and now holds about 1.8 million shares. Michael F. Henn, chief 
financial officer of Vons, said some investors have been selling shares to 
profit from the recent run-up in Vons' share price. Richard E. Rainwater, a 
former adviser to the Bass brothers of Texas, is a general partner of 
Investment Limited Partnership.

STEALTH CUTS SHORT ITS SECOND FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
LOW OIL PRESSURE READING FORCES IT TO LAND AFTER HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The B-2 Stealth bomber's second flight came to a premature halt today when a 
low oil pressure reading forced pilots to land the $530-million plane an hour 
after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with it and will 
have to check it out," said 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an Air Force spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the Mojave Desert at 7:29 a.m. for a 
three- to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m. because "there were some 
minor concerns with the oil pressure indicators," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was decided to land, which is a normal procedure during any type of 
flight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Col. Richard S. Couch and Northrop Corp. chief test pilot Bruce J. 
Hinds "were never in any danger" but they "obviously would have liked to 
accomplish more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "we did achieve some of the things we set out to do, so we can't 
say it wasn't a successful flight," Sjaardema said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Faster' and 'Higher' 
</P>
<P>
The B-2, a tailless flying wing, flew with its landing gear retracted for the 
first time and flew "a little bit faster and a little bit higher" than on the 
first flight in July, although the Air Force won't specify the speed and 
altitude, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-engine bomber, the world's most expensive plane, is intended to carry 
nuclear bombs and, along with the conventional B-1, to replace the Air Force's 
aging B-52 fleet. It is under fire in Congress because of its cost. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the B-2's four engines "has an accessory drive. One out of the four 
drives indicated low oil pressure," Sjaardema said. 
</P>
<P>
Each accessory drive is like a transmission, connected to each engine by a 
shaft. The drives power air turbine starters and hydraulic systems, Sjaardema 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Air turbine starters are used to restart engines if they halt during flight. 
The B-2's hydraulics apparently control its landing gear, but it isn't known if 
they are used to move flaps and other control surfaces, as is the case on many 
planes. Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius said there was no failure of the hydraulic 
system.

IMPORTED OIL TOPS 50% MARK IN JULY

<P>
Imports for the first time in 12 years supplied more than half the nation's 
demand for petroleum in July as production from Alaska's aging fields slowed, 
the American Petroleum Institute reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry group in its monthly statistical survey reported that total 
imports of crude oil and refined products averaged 8.5 million barrels a day, 
or 50.4% of all U.S. deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
The only other time imports supplied more than half U.S. needs was 1977, when 
foreign oil exceeded the 50% mark three times in the months of March, May and 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska contributed 234,000 barrels to the total 574,000 barrels-a-day total 
year-to-year July decline, the API said, although half of the state's drop was 
a temporary cutback caused by maintenance work.

Iran's Parliament today elected as its Speaker a fiercely anti-Western cleric, 
Mehdi Karrubi, underlining radicals' strength and the uphill task facing 
incoming President Hashemi Rafsanjani in pursuing more pragmatic policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian news agency IRNA said Karrubi, 52, was chosen ahead of his moderate 
challenger, Ali Akbar Nateq Noori, by 147 votes to 92. 
</P>
<P>
Karrubi's election is unlikely to affect Iran's stance on key questions, such 
as the fate of Western hostages believed held by pro-Iranian militants in 
Lebanon, which will be decided by a handful of top leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But hard-liners in Parliament can force policies on the Cabinet, as they did 
with a resolution ordering a break in ties with Britain over the Salman Rushdie 
affair in March.

<P>
A Camarillo man who tried to eliminate a back-yard squirrel problem by pouring 
gasoline into a hole and lighting it accidentally sparked a 35-acre brush fire 
that slightly injured two people and destroyed a neighbor's house, the Ventura 
County Fire Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started behind a home at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in the 800 block of Mission 
Drive when the ignited gasoline spread to nearby trees and brush. Authorities 
declined to identify the man who started the fire but said he will be billed 
for the costs of fighting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The fire spread along the side of a canyon, skirting several homes before 
engulfing a house about half a mile from the starting point of the blaze, 
department spokeswoman Paula Aliano said. Two residents suffered minor 
injuries, including some smoke inhalation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 firefighters extinguished the blaze by 8 p.m. Damage to the home and 
two cars was estimated at $200,000.

An Israeli-Arab doctors association today condemned medical conditions in the 
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, citing inadequate services and Israeli military 
action against patients and staff. 
</P>
<P>
In a 32-page report, the Assn. of Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human 
Rights alleged that medical services in the Gaza Strip "are tied to political, 
not medical (or) professional policy." 
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of the uprising in the occupied territories, a new 
tendency has appeared -- the use of medicine as an additional means of 
repression against the population," the report said. "This means that medicine 
has been removed from the status of a basic human right and recruited as a 
means of punishment."

Civil rights groups and their supporters will mount a mass lobbying campaign to 
overturn a series of Supreme Court decisions limiting affirmative action, NAACP 
President Benjamin Hooks said today. 
</P>
<P>
But Hooks said "it will be very difficult to write legislation that will close 
all the holes" left by rulings earlier this year that undermine affirmative 
action programs and make racial discrimination more difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks, at a news conference kicking off the annual meeting of Blacks in 
Government, criticized the conservative majority on the Supreme Court as "more 
dangerous than Bull Connor, Jim Clark and George Wallace" -- Southern officials 
who opposed, sometimes with violence, the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

QUAYLE FOCUSES ON GOOD NEWS AND IGNORES THE BAD

Vice President Dan Quayle said today a new poll shows "I'm off to a very good 
start," even though it found that more than half the people surveyed thought 
that he isn't qualified to be President. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly a 2-1 approval ratio for the way 
Quayle is handling the vice presidency. However, 52% of those questioned said 
he was not qualified to take over the presidency. And 43% said Bush should 
select another running mate if he runs for reelection. (Poll in Part 1, Page 
17.) 
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted to see that by a ratio of 2-1 Americans think I am doing a 
good job as vice president," Quayle said today at a photo session. "I feel I'm 
off to a very good start." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he explained the 52% figure, Quayle said, "I tend to accentuate the 
positive, and I have a very positive ratio of support with the American people 
of 2-1 on how I am doing the job. They approve of the way I am doing the job. 
That's good news for me." 
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the poll's findings 
today. "We think the public does have confidence in the vice president," he 
told reporters en route to Miami with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush "thinks the vice president is doing an excellent job; he 
has outstanding qualities in many areas." Asked whether he had faith in public 
opinion polls, the spokesman said: "I never believe in the bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle talked about the poll as he posed for pictures with Han Xu, who is 
returning to Beijing after serving as ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle called it a "final courtesy call" and said the two would have "a frank 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly I will be giving him messages that he can take back to his 
government," the vice president said.

The Dubuque, now commanded by Capt. D. L. Wetherwell, was permitted to put the

DOW ADVANCES 5.51 ON BARGAIN-HUNTING DAY

<P>
Wall Street stocks rose today on light bargain hunting in scattered issues, 
edging the Dow index closer to the 2,700 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.51 points to 2,693.29. It had briefly 
touched a high of 2,702 earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The index of 30 leading shares has had trouble returning to its all-time 
closing high of 2,722.42 reached Aug. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange volume was a moderate 150 million shares and advances 
led declines by nearly 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
Traders described the market's rise as timid and for the most part investors 
were sidelined, waiting for Thursday's U.S. trade figures for June and Friday's 
consumer inflation report for July. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were remaining cautious after the market's recent 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's summer caution," said Carter Randall, an equities analyst with the 
Randall Co. "As the market goes up there's selling pressure and it keeps the 
market weak." 
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks, including IBM, lagged during most of the session but 
cyclical stocks such as autos kept that sector firm, said Charles Jensen, chief 
technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is still looking for a base of support following the decline that 
began last week," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 29 points on Friday after bonds 
skidded following new government data that showed the economy was not as weak 
as thought. The report diminished hopes that the Federal Reserve would lower 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Government reports this morning on July U.S. industrial production and capacity 
utilization and housing starts appeared to be in line with expectations and had 
little impact on the market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were little changed in light trading early today, shrugging off the 
government's latest economic data. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 1/16 point, or about 62 
cents for every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which rises 
when prices fall, edged up to 8.16% from 8.15% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, bond prices recovered some ground after consecutive sell-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bonds showed little reaction to reports today that new housing 
starts and industrial production rose and that the factory operating rate 
remained flat in July. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically show a moderating economy but one that's not threatened by a 
recession," said Kevin Flanagan, chief money-market economist at Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the market also was subdued by traders' caution ahead of more 
government reports: Thursday's merchandise trade figures for June and Friday's 
retail price inflation for July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secondary Market 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term issues were 
1/32 point lower to 1/8 point higher, intermediate securities edged up 1/16 
point to 3/32 point and 20-year issues gained 1/32 point, according to the 
Telerate Inc. financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
edged up 0.75 to 1,178.72. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 
0.02 at 327.21. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills slipped to 8.25% as the discount lost 2 
basis points to 7.98%. Yields on six-month bills declined to 8.25% as the 
discount slipped 1 basis point to 7.83%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.25% 
as the discount declined 1 basis point to 7.69%.

Japan has opened contacts with Britain and the United States over a possible

industry sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
They said Japan has approached British Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas about 
the Harrier 2, which is being developed especially for use at sea and which is 
a refinement of the original Harrier vertical-takeoff aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is considering a number of planes, including the U.S. F-15, to protect 
its sea lanes up to 1,000 miles from its shores. The aircraft would go into 
service in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The British-designed Harrier can take off and land vertically, allowing it to 
operate easily from large ships or small land bases.

<P>
Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2% in July, but the factory operating 
rate remained flat, the Federal Reserve Board said today in a report that 
indicated further easing of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Factory use held steady at 83.6% last month after declining 0.3 of a percentage 
point in June, the central bank said. The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3% last 
December. Last month's operating rate was down from 83.7% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater 
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and 
price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85% or above 
as an indication of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Straddling Fine Line 
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been straddling a fine line of keeping interest rates high 
enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the 
economy slides into a recession. It began letting rates drop in June as 
inflation seemed to lessen. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index in July stood at 
141.7% of its 1977 base, up from 141.4% in June. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.2% increase last month came after revised 0.1% drops in both May and 
June. Those were the first downturns since the index fell 0.2% in February, 
which had been the first drop in a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of raw 
materials and continued strength in business equipment excluding autos. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, automobile and truck production fell sharply, and output of 
construction supplies, on balance, remained weak," it said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Factory Operating Rate Dips 
</P>
<P>

The Pillsbury Co. said today it plans to sell its Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. 
subsidiary to an affiliate of Unicord Co. Ltd. of Thailand for $269 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Bumble Bee and its Santa Fe Springs manufacturing facility to the 
newly formed Uni Group Inc., a U.S.-based affiliate of Unicord, is expected to 
be completed in September, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
It follows Pillsbury's announcement last week that it will sell its Van de 
Kamp's frozen seafoods division to the Chicago-based Whitman Corp. for about 
$140 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Bumble Bee, like Van de Kamp's, is an exceptionally strong company. However, 
it does not fit with Pillsbury's long-range strategy for its core businesses," 
said Ian A. Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Pillsbury.

ROSE FACES PROBE FOR SHOVING UMP

National League President Bill White is reviewing a shoving incident involving 
Cincinnati Reds second baseman Ron Oester, manager Pete Rose and umpire Joe 
West, a spokeswoman for White said today. 
</P>
<P>
League spokeswoman Katy Feeney said White is gathering reports from the umpires 
and will review any available videotapes of the incident, which occurred at the 
end of the Reds' 12-inning 5-2 loss Tuesday night to the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision May Take Time 
</P>
<P>
White may not make a decision for a day or two and would only announce 
suspensions, not fines, Feeney said. 
</P>
<P>
She said White will review the incident as a separate matter and will not take 
into account a probe by baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti of allegations that 
Rose may have bet on baseball, including games involving the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
If found guilty of betting on the Reds, Rose could be suspended from baseball 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
That issue is tied up in federal court, where Rose has obtained temporary 
protection against discipline by Giamatti while a court considers the manager's 
lawsuit challenging the commissioner's authority to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
"Each incident is judged on its own merits. Each incident is judged 
individually," Feeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when White will issue his decision, Feeney said, "There's no specific 
timetable. . . . Mr. White is just getting the report from the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
Rose's involvement in the shoving incident came 16 months after his 30-day 
suspension and $10,000 fine for shoving umpire Dave Pallone. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati manager and West shoved each other Tuesday night after Rose went 
to the defense of Oester, who also exchanged bumps with West. (Story in Sports 
section.) 
</P>
<P>
"You saw what they did when I pushed Pallone last year," Rose said, referring 
to his punishment. "Let's see what happens now." 
</P>
<P>
West was involved in a similar incident in 1983. The umpire was suspended for 
three days and fined $300 for pushing Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre.

Transcripts of a Massachusetts police telephone wiretap indicate that Pete Rose 
lied to baseball investigators when he said he did not know that a 
Massachusetts individual was a bookmaker, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
A Nov. 12, 1984, conversation between Joseph S. Cambra and Manuel Fernandez 
indicates that Rose wanted to bet every day, according to a report in today's 
editions of the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the transcript indicates that Cambra told Rose that he 
would not accept bets more than once a week. The transcript was made a day 
before Cambra, Fernandez and 41 others were arrested in gambling raids in 
southeastern Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Rose told baseball investigator John M. Dowd that "he did not know 
Cambra was a bookmaker," according to a Dowd deposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Rose denied ever betting with Cambra," Dowd said in the deposition.

Chris Evert has decided to take part in a record 19th U.S. Open championship, 
the Women's International Tennis Assn. announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, who has not played since she lost to Steffi Graf in the semifinals at 
Wimbledon on July 6, will also take part in the Canadian Open next week to 
prepare for the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 28 in New York, the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Evert's participation will set a record for women in the tournament, which she 
has won six times. She shares the mark with Pam Teeguarden, who also played in 
18 Opens. 
</P>
<P>
Her tennis career has been in doubt after a series of disappointing 
performances this year, with Evert suggesting that she might retire.

BREWERS' GANTNER TO HAVE SURGERY

The Milwaukee Brewers said today that second baseman Jim Gantner will undergo 
surgery to repair severe damage to a ligament in his left knee suffered in a 
play at second Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery on the medial collateral ligament was to be done this afternoon by 
team physician Dr. Paul Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his quick pivots at second base where he was unyielding in the face 
of hard-charging baserunners, Gantner had been producing at the plate as well. 
He batted .330 since the All-Star break to raise his average to .274. 
</P>
<P>
But as he took a low throw from shortstop Billy Spiers on a potential 
double-play grounder in the seventh inning Tuesday night, Gantner was 
roll-blocked by the New York Yankees' Marcus Lawton. Umpire Dave Phillips 
called an automatic double play because of Lawton's interference. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Billy Bates has been called up by the Brewers from their Denver 
farm club.

UPSET BUT OPTIMISTIC, DRAVECKY HEADS FOR S.F. WITH BROKEN ARM

<P>
Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky, with his broken left arm in a sling, appeared 
upset but optimistic as he headed back for San Francisco today, confident that 
"everything is going to be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky's dramatic comeback was stalled, and his career again was placed in in 
jeopardy, when he broke a bone in his pitching arm while on the mound against 
the Montreal Expos on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky was making his second start of the season for San Francisco, a year 
after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his left arm. He fell 
face down on the mound after delivering a pitch to Tim Raines in the sixth 
inning. (Story, Part III, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky was wheeled from Olympic Stadium on a stretcher and taken to Queen 
Elizabeth Hospital, where he learned that the humerus bone in his left arm, the 
bone between the elbow and the shoulder, had snapped when he delivered the 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving his hotel this morning to catch a flight to San Francisco, Dravecky, 
33, appeared upset but said, "Everything is going to be all right" when asked 
if he thought his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord is in control," Dravecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky, his arm in a padded sling, said he is not going to think about a 
comeback for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I'm not concerned about that," he said. "I think the key is 
going through rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that his season is probably over. 
</P>
<P>
But Dravecky, who helped the Giants to a 3-2 victory over the Expos in the 
game, said he is happy he left on a winning note.
