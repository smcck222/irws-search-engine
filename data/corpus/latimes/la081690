ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Harvey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new brochure available at L.A. bus and train stations and other Civic Center 
establishments "welcomes you to downtown" -- with tips that conjure up a sequel 
to Neil Simon's disaster comedy, "The Out-of-Towners." Or perhaps a local 
version of "Escape from New York." 
</P>
<P>
The brochure, offering nary so much as a coupon for a two-for-one deal at the 
Kosher Burrito, warns visitors to watch out for robbers, burglars, purse 
snatchers, shoplifters and beggars. Even purveyors of "the 3-card monte or 
shell game" are mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
A reader who picked up one of the fliers wrote Only in L.A. to say it 
"certainly doesn't instill confidence" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, it was written not by the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau, 
but by the the L.A. Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
A bookkeeper, testifying in a trial involving a business partnership, was 
droning on about projected income, earnings estimates, etc., in Santa Monica 
Superior Court when suddenly the doors to the courtroom swung open. 
</P>
<P>
There were bright flashes of light as cameras in the hallway clicked away. 
Illuminated in the doorway was the massive frame of Marlon Brando, wearing navy 
blue jacket and reddish tie. He surveyed the scene, then strode down to the 
front row and took a seat. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, the bookkeeper lost her train of thought. The attorney 
questioning her became flustered and said, "I can't compete with this." 
</P>
<P>
The judge announced that the trial was suspended so that the matter involving 
bail for Brando's son, Christian, could be heard. "Sorry for the disruption in 
your case," a bailiff told the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nice moment. As marathon runner Joan Benoit neared the victory line at 
the Coliseum in the 1984 Olympics, she passed by a mural of herself winning the 
Boston Marathon. Of course, in L.A., 1984 is ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
The mural -- and the building it decorated on Menlo Avenue -- are being torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men involved in L.A.'s Great Manhole Theft Caper was sentenced to 
County Jail Wednesday. He and a partner confessed to filching more than 300 
covers to sell as scrap metal. Turns out they could have made 30 times as much 
money by recycling the same weight in aluminum soft-drink cans. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, it got us to wondering about the outcome of the earlier search by 
Sacramento's Public Works Department for a non-sexist term for "manhole." 
</P>
<P>
After all, Only in L.A. had joined in the effort. Our winner, suggested by 
readers L. Paul Cook and Donald Lehti, was "access covers," a term used in 
Britain. (It was the only entry to get more than one vote, a clear case of 
manhole apathy). 
</P>
<P>
Christine Olsen, the public works spokeswoman in Sacramento, said she received 
"exit port," "personhole," "person entry," and several that rhymed, including 
"sewer viewer." 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring Only in L.A., Sacramento ultimately chose "maintenance hole covers." 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"They (manholes) are shown on our maps with MH in a circle," said Olsen. "We 
didn't want to have to change the MHs." 
</P>

Carrying an average of 337,000 cars per day, the Santa Monica Freeway is the 
world's most heavily traveled thoroughfare. The busiest stretch is just east of 
the Normandie Avenue exit.

AL MARTINEZ: DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody is happy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
We are all in terrible arguments over barking dogs, loud parties, ugly fences, 
yowling cats, rude waiters, dumb clerks, crazy skateboarders, morally deprived 
auto mechanics and teachers who can't communicate. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the only way one could resolve a dispute was to sue or beat 
hell out of an antagonist. Calling the police did little good. They were too 
busy being cowboys to worry about a dog defecating on someone's lawn. 
</P>
<P>
As society became more complex, computers added another dimension to life's 
miseries. We began to find ourselves victimized by electronic equipment devoid 
of those human traits that once offered warmth in moments of travail. We are in 
a war with computers we cannot win. 
</P>
<P>
They show no mercy and take no prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Then lawyers, may lightning strike them, were granted the right to advertise, 
thrusting society onto a new and even more hellish plane of displeasure. If sex 
sells soap, lawyers were suddenly peddling human conflict. 
</P>
<P>
When in doubt, they told us, sue. 
</P>
<P>
By nature parasitic, members of the legal profession have gone out of their way 
to enhance the kind of enmity that often ends up in civil court, thus elevating 
their own standards of living at the cost of everyone else's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
When the world ends, only one person will survive. That will be a lawyer, and 
he will sue God. 
</P>
<P>
What to do about all this? I have the answer. Low-cost mediation. 
</P>
<P>
An old idea with a relatively new application, mediation has become the thing 
to do in California during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
There are a dozen public mediation agencies in L.A. County, with hundreds of 
workers, all anxious to settle things between you and the neighbor with the 
defecating dog. 
</P>
<P>
Their fees are usually nominal, you don't need a lawyer and you don't have to 
wait five years for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
I know of this through Myra Schegloff, a weaver who sells her wares at the 
Topanga Days community fair. She began telling me about her role in the 
mediation of neighborhood disputes, of which there are many in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
She is a handsome middle-aged woman with flecks of gray in her hair and a 
manner of speaking that makes you feel . . . well . . . at peace. I would 
imagine Mary, the mother of Jesus, had a voice like Myra Schegloff. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, I visited her at the Claremont Dispute Resolution Center, where she 
works when she's not weaving, and discussed mediation with Myra and with the 
center's executive director, Jerry Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
A man with a graying beard and rimless glasses, Pearson also has that kind of 
disarming, soul-soothing quality that can turn mad dogs into hand-lickers. Even 
his seersucker jacket seemed somehow pacifying. 
</P>
<P>
As we spoke, classical music played in the background. I've never felt so calm 
in my life. Twice I almost smiled. 
</P>
<P>
The Claremont center operates under the county's Department of Consumer Affairs 
and charges $10 to mediate a dispute, or nothing if you're poor. 
</P>
<P>
Schegloff and Pearson oversee a staff of about 50 volunteers who are trained in 
the art of bringing people together and having them talk out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Their caseload comes from a disputant himself or from referrals, and they will 
handle anything from a neighborhood fight to contested bills, although they 
will not handle situations that involve major felonies. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, for those easily confused by priorities, is to call the Claremont 
Center before murdering your neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Marital disputes comprise a good portion of the center's work. One woman, for 
instance, wanted to end her 58-year marriage because her husband was playing 
around with other women. He was 80 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A mediator couldn't stop the old fool from messing with the chickies but did 
help in an equitable division of community property. That made her happy, and 
him too, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
In another situation, a man and woman who had been living together ended their 
relationship. The parting was not amicable. 
</P>
<P>
The man was angry because he had paid to beautify the woman's breasts through 
silicone implants and now she was leaving and taking her full breasts with her. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants his money back," Myra said, soothingly. "The question seems to be, 
what percentage of enjoyment did he get out of her breasts? We're trying to 
work out a rate of partial repayment." 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. Solve your problems through a peacemaking third person and 
starve a lawyer. Meanwhile, keep your dog out of my yard and repair your ugly 
fence.

SCIENCE AND POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John A. Moore (Science, Common Sense and Our Public Fears," Commentary, Aug. 
12) presents a reasonable-sounding position on the role of scientists in 
informing social policy decisions. He also appears to be so politically naive 
that he might as well be from another planet. 
</P>
<P>
Moore would rely on the opinions of "mainstream" scientists. What this ignores 
is the relationship most "mainstream" scientists have with the profit-driven 
corporations that employ them. The problem is compounded because our elected 
representatives are so very often beholden to the same corporations. Academic 
institutions are as likely as not dependent on federal funds. In some cases 
their hands are tied outright by legislation prohibiting some kinds of 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as Greenpeace, The Heritage Foundation, and Ralph Nader's 
Public Citizen provide some alternatives -- but they all have their own agendas 
as well. Only when we clean up Congress -- perhaps with public funding of 
campaigns -- will we begin to see real advancement.

CHEMICAL ARMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your informative and humane editorial on chemical weapons ("To the Brink: What 
an Ugly War," Aug. 9) contained a serious omission. During our mistaken 
involvement in Vietnam, we used huge amounts of napalm and Agent Orange, both 
of which figure clearly as chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering this distressing page from our recent past puts a peculiarly ironic 
and significant twist on your entirely appropriate conclusion that "History's 
pigeons have a way of coming home to roost." 
</P>
<P>
We are known to have been manufacturing chemical and biological weapons since 
our withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Clean hands are a condition of our 
credibility if, as most Americans hope, we provide leadership in the world for 
outlawing the use of these cruel and savage instruments of destruction.

THE CRITICS OF AMERICAN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his July 31 article ("Nibble at Freedom, and Risk Losing It All," 
Commentary) we see Judge Irving R. Kaufman supporting the Federal (taxpayer) 
funding of trash "art," because of the First Amendment. Tell me, where in the 
Constititution does it say that any federal funding of art is allowed? 
</P>
<P>
Where does it say no tax dollars may go to show the Christian faith in a good 
way, but may be used to discriminate against it? 
</P>
<P>
May antisemitic or racist "art" also be funded? 
</P>
<P>
Does the good judge, who is so supportive of the Constitution, also support the 
Second Amendment as fully? 
</P>
<P>
Lastly -- as democracy is even coming to the Soviet Union, why not the U.S.A.? 
Would the judge support having the taxpayers vote for how their money is spent 
-- as in what "art" is funded?

YOSEMITE FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am troubled by your coverage of the Yosemite-area fires ("Thousands More 
Acres Blackened," Aug. 13). While I certainly sympathize with those who have 
lost property, I would urge your writers and editors to realize that these 
fires are not ecological disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Fires have been happening for as long as there have been forests. Many species, 
including the Sequoia redwoods, rely on regular fires to burn off other 
competing foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, man's success at putting out fires as soon as they start is 
actually endangering the forests. Today, there ismuch more combustible material 
on the forest floor than there would naturally be. This means that fires today 
burn considerably hotter than they would if natural fires were allowed to run 
their course. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud The Times' coverage of ecological issues, and I urge you to educate 
yourselves and your readers on this issue.

The Plot Thickens: As far as John Frew, 25, is concerned, science-fiction 
writer Ray Bradbury has had his day in the sun. Frew has started a petition 
drive in Waukegan, Ill., to restore his great-great-grandfather's name to a 
park renamed for native son Bradbury. The site for years was called Powell's 
Park, in honor of 19th-Century Mayor John F. Powell. Frew said he doesn't 
object to honoring Bradbury, but thinks a library or other landmark would be 
more appropriate.

Weighing In: The National Assn. for the Defense of Fat Acceptance is coming to 
the aid of Regina Elizabeth Guy, 25, in her battle to stop Maryland from 
suspending her driver's license. The state claims Guy's 367 pounds force her to 
drive from the center of the front seat, operating the accelerator and brake 
with her left foot. Guy says it's discrimination. NADFA plans to demonstrate at 
a Friday hearing in Baltimore.

Who's Laughing Now?: Vice President Dan Quayle may still be No. 1 on the 
Democratic Party joke list, but it's the Republicans who are laughing all the 
way to the bank. So far, Quayle has raised more than $12 million for the party 
since he became vice president. One GOP insider said Quayle's fund-raising 
skills stem partly from the attacks on him. "Some come just to see if he's as 
bad as the press says."

Squashed: If the Guinness Book of World Records had a category for "Offending 
People With a Zucchini," Jodi Wubben, 19, would win. Her sculpture, "The 
Incident," was ordered off the Larimer County Fairgrounds in Loveland, Colo., 
on the grounds it was "tasteless." Wubben entered the piece in a "Zany Zucchini 
Day" contest to draw attention to her claim that her father, Don, was hit by a 
sheriff's deputy July 22. Her display depicted a zucchini with a club standing 
over a fallen vegetable.

ART BUCHWALD: FLYING OFF HANDLE OVER AIR FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I took my friend Pierce to the airport the other day. He was flying coach from 
Boston to Los Angeles. The gentleman behind the counter said, "That will be 
$700." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce exclaimed, "Seven-hundred dollars! I'm not flying by Concorde." 
</P>
<P>
The man replied, "That is our special summer rate fare for tourist class." 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous," Pierce blurted. "How can you charge someone $700 for that 
flight?" 
</P>
<P>
The man said, "You are our only paying flyer. Everyone else is either a free 
mileage passenger or an employee of the airline heading back home." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce asked: "Don't you have people who purchase their tickets anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hardly ever. It's refreshing to meet someone like you who isn't looking for a 
free lunch." 
</P>
<P>
"Since I'm the only paying passenger on the flight, couldn't I be upgraded from 
tourist to first class?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hardly think so. Most of our upgrades are people who have 60,000 miles in 
credit and have slept in a Hilton Hotel for three nights. They naturally get 
priority over someone like yourself who is paying cash for his seat." 
</P>
<P>
"How does an airline earn money when it gives away all its flights?" 
</P>
<P>
"We make our profit on cheap maintenance. What we lose on fares we save in our 
hangars." 
</P>
<P>
I said to Pierce, "It looks as if you don't have any choice." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce spoke up, "Wait a minute. How long will it take before I fly for free?" 
</P>
<P>
The clerk looked in his book. "I would say two more flights should do it, 
providing you eat at a Red Lobster restaurant and see Dick Tracy 16 times. We 
have tie-ins with everyone for our 'Come Fly With Me' August free-fall 
program." 
</P>
<P>
"OK," said Pierce. "Give me a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
As the man wrote it out, he murmured, "We would prefer if you didn't mention to 
the other passengers that you paid for your seat." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce went red. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because they'll think you're a snob. Most of our free flyers are very proud, 
and they won't sit next to people who bought their tickets." 
</P>
<P>
"You just made me pay $700 for a trip to L.A., and now you tell me I can't talk 
about it?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an FAA regulation, but it has been our experience that people who 
have purchased their tickets at full price are considered dumb, and no one has 
respect for them." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said: "I don't see any humor in this. If you really cared about paying 
passengers, you would give them the red carpet so everyone in the airport would 
know who we are." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to start a precedent. If we give paying passengers the royal 
treatment, then our employees will demand the same thing, and we can't offend 
them because they take up a lot of free seats on our planes. You ought to feel 
lucky I sold you a ticket. I have someone who won a trip on 'Wheel of Fortune' 
who is waiting on standby for your seat." 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you take me over him?" Pierce wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the FAA insists we keep a number of seats aside in case some sucker 
wants to pay."

LEGAL VIEW: OTHER APPROACHES TO LOWER COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein, an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the ways to improve access to affordable legal services is to allow 
licensed, independent paralegals to perform routine legal services in such 
fields as landlord-tenant and bankruptcy. That was the subject of last week's 
column. The State Bar Commission on Legal Technicians had recommended just such 
an approach. 
</P>
<P>
The commission made several other recommendations that could help make the law 
more understandable to average folks. Here are some of them, with my comments. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase the jurisdictional limit of small claims courts to $5,000. In 
January of next year, the current ceiling of $2,000 will go to $2,500. There is 
a bill pending before the legislature that would increase it to $5,000. Earlier 
attempts to increase the limit to $5,000 were unsuccessful. Small Claims Court, 
where you represent yourself without a lawyer, is an excellent way for people 
to solve relatively minor disputes (minor, that is, when compared to the kinds 
of cases heard in superior or municipal court). It simply isn't cost effective 
for two sides to each pay a lawyer $500 to $1,500 to help resolve a case that 
is only worth $4,200. 
</P>
<P>
* Implement a courthouse information office (or else authorize court clerks) to 
provide basic information about required forms and court procedures, similar to 
the advisory service in small claims court. Court clerks are generally 
reluctant to explain how to fill out a court document because of the 
possibility that they will be accused of the unauthorized practice of law. In 
San Francisco county last year, 60% of the petitioner's filings in family law 
court were filed without a lawyer, according to the commission. Other counties 
experience similar trends. For those who are unable or unwilling to pay for a 
lawyer, some basic guidance through the courthouse thicket can only help 
improve the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
* Expand Neighborhood Justice Centers and other methods of alternative dispute 
resolution. A great idea. Mediation is a way to help people resolve their 
disputes in a less formal setting than courts, with less effort spent on 
fact-finding and more emphasis on working together to find mutually 
satisfactory solutions. The Neighborhood Justice Center in Santa Monica 
(213-854-0122) was one of the first, and is open to all. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider a requirement that service of an unlawful detainer complaint include 
information on how to obtain responsible legal assistance. What this proposes, 
translated into English, is that when your landlord slaps you with an eviction 
lawsuit, you receive a piece of paper explaining how to find a lawyer to fight 
the suit. That would be especially valuable to someone unfamiliar with the 
legal system and lawyers, which is probably the case with most people who are 
facing eviction proceedings. Maybe that sort of information sheet should 
accompany the complaint in any kind of lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of other ideas kicking around to make the law more accessible, 
but what makes these interesting is that they were all proposed by a commission 
appointed by the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
They reflect the increasing recognition within the legal profession that 
affordable legal services must be a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
And they should be.

MAGAZINES: THE BIG THAW: WILL WE MISS COLD WAR?; 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINES: CONTINUED NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IS THE MOST PROBABLE SCENARIO FOR 
LASTING GEOPOLITICAL PEACE, SAYS ATLANTIC MONTHLY'S PESSIMISTIC COVER STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Mearsheimer did not predict the invasion of Kuwait. But his cover story in 
the August Atlantic Monthly -- "Why We Will Soon Miss the Cold War" -- does 
resonate with the rumbling of tanks. 
</P>
<P>
And although his fairly intricate thesis focuses exclusively on Europe, readers 
who were already beginning to luxuriate in the soothing calm of a relatively 
stress-free Western world will probably give his ideas a more sober reading 
after being so rudely awakened by the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
The years between 1648 and 1945, Mearsheimer points out, were racked by one war 
after another. The Cold War caused the bellicose Europeans to chill out. Now 
it's only a matter of time before tempers once again flare and bullets -- if 
not larger and more dangerous projectiles -- fly, Mearsheimer predicts. 
</P>
<P>
The "bipolar" standoff between the equally matched Soviets and Yanks, along 
with worldwide horror at the thought of using nuclear weapons, is what kept the 
nations of Europe from engaging in the sort of behavior that resulted in the 
killing of about 50 million Europeans between 1900 and 1945, he writes. Now 
those deterrents are evaporating, and "Europe is reverting to a state system 
that created powerful incentives for aggression in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Mearsheimer, chairman of the political science department at the University of 
Chicago, sees three possible scenarios for post-Cold War Europe. 
</P>
<P>
First is the "Europe without nuclear weapons" scenario. But because of the 
potential for nations like Germany to return to "hypernationalism," Mearsheimer 
is relieved that this "most dangerous among the envisionable post-Cold War 
orders . . . does not appear to be in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
Second is "The Current Ownership" scenario, in which the nuclear powers in 
Europe maintain their weaponry but no new nuclear powers emerge. But this isn't 
going to happen either, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
Third, and most probable, is the "Nuclear Proliferation" scenario. This is the 
one in which he sees the most hope for stability, arguing, "Mismanaged 
proliferation could produce disaster (but) well-managed proliferation could 
produce an order nearly as stable as that of the Long Peace" (John Lewis 
Gaddis' term for the Cold War). 
</P>
<P>
Even here, though, he doesn't see much hope that proliferation will be anything 
less than pell-mell. 
</P>
<P>
So, without a trace of irony, he contends that the West has "an interest in 
continuing the Cold War confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, not even that seems likely to Mearsheimer. So, according to his gloomy 
world view, there's little to do but watch the bodies begin piling up in some 
corner of illusorily peaceful Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With luck, a chorus of informed political soothsayers will soon begin to shout 
out logical and well-supported analyses explaining that Mearsheimer's 
pessimistic world view is cockeyed. Meanwhile, it seems likely that Francis 
Fukuyama, author of last year's much-discussed "End of History" (Remember? The 
one that predicts a quick end to international squabbling) is probably reading 
the August Atlantic -- and the headlines -- and scratching his head. 
</P>
<P>

What does the issue of gun control have to do with the black community? Plenty, 
according to a powerful article in the September issue of the African-American 
publication Emerge -- "Our Voice in the World." "Every year more than 85,000 
African-Americans know the terrifying sensation of a bullet entering their 
bodies," write authors Roberto Santiago and Walter Lowe Jr. Nearly 10,000 of 
those victims die. "Yet, in the African-American community, there has never 
been the degree of support for stricter gun control laws that might be 
expected." This passionate but balanced essay argues that it's time for black 
America to confront the gun issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblyman Richard Katz's plan to turn the Los Angeles River into a freeway 
receives yet another setback in the August Los Angeles Magazine. In a piece 
titled "Mark Twain!," author Neil Cohen takes a long look at the river and 
finds that the infamous concrete ditch is -- at least in places -- beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Magazine accents its appreciation of the river with color 
photography, and hard though it may be to believe, some of the pictures portray 
scenes so bucolic and tranquil they would fit in on a Sierra Club nature 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
* ". . . Above all, our society needs to stop thinking of drug abuse as a moral 
and legal question and begin to treat it instead as a public health problem," 
Abdelmonem A. Afifi, dean of UCLA's School of Public Health, writes in the 
summer issue of UCLA Magazine, the school's alumni publication. What follows 
his introduction is a rounded and well-written, if too basic, primer by 
students and faculty members on "Drugs in America." 
</P>
<P>
* The 1939 New York World's Fair was a $155-million fanfare to the future, a 
celebration to announce the coming "Age of Consumerism." General Motor's 
Futurama showed 28,000 people a day what the '60s would hold, including $200 
cars that would move by radio control on seven-lane highways. "In the future," 
the narrator promised, "cars will be air conditioned." Featured in the 
September issue of Joe Franklin's Nostalgia, the World's Fair story offers an 
enlightening look back at the future, complete with dozens of great photos, 
including a heroic sculpture dedicated to "Asbestos -- the magic mineral."

SIERRA MADRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Anderson and Joanna McLaughlin giggled and agreed about the high points of 
their trip to Southern California: sunny weather, a ride in a 
telephone-equipped Mercedes, and pizza -- with lots of pepperoni. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only thing the two 14-year-olds said they really disagree on is 
who gets the shower first in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past six weeks, Jean and Joanna have become fast friends while staying 
with the family of Sierra Madre residents Sharon and Bill Duffy. But back home 
in Belfast, Northern Ireland, their different religious backgrounds might have 
prevented them from ever speaking to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna, who is Catholic, and Jean, who is Protestant, are two of 95 students 
ages 14 to 17 who are staying with American host families in the United States 
this summer as part of a program designed to foster cultural understanding -- 
and build lasting friendships -- among Catholic and Protestant teen-agers from 
strife-ridden Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Jean and Joanna are among six Northern Ireland teen-agers visiting California 
this summer as part of the Children's Friendship Project for Northern Ireland 
Inc. The others are four boys who are staying with host families in Westlake 
Village and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1987, the project has arranged for about 390 boys and 
girls to spend six weeks with host families in the United States as a sort of 
grass-roots approach to an age-old conflict, said Peggy Barrett, 60, the 
nonprofit organization's national president in Manheim, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (participants) change their way of life. Even their parents . . . get 
to know one another and become friends," said Barrett, who was born in Brooklyn 
but grew up in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Host families pay all of the students' expenses in the United States, including 
air fare to and from Northern Ireland. Typically, the host family must raise 
about $2,000. Since the organization is nonprofit, the expenditures are 
tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Duffy said she decided to initiate her own fund-raising campaign after 
learning about the program through a notice in the newspaper on St. Patrick's 
Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Of Irish descent herself, Duffy said the benefits of the program have been well 
worth her time and money. Jean and Joanna have virtually become part of the 
Duffy family, which already includes two boys and a girl, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a responsibility, but for what you're getting in exchange, you can't put 
a money value on that," Duffy said. "Now it's starting to be kind of sad 
because they're going home. I don't know how many years it will be before we 
get to Northern Ireland, but we will, and when we do we'll stay with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that we'll have a lifelong friendship." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tourist attractions, Duffy has taken Jean and Joanna to a Sierra 
Madre City Council meeting and a local courthouse to show the girls "how our 
system of government works." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy also arranged for the girls to go on a ride-along with a Sierra Madre 
police officer, and she has taken them both to her Catholic church for Mass 
each Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jean, a Protestant, said she found Mass very similar to other religious 
services she has attended. "There's only one God," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The program also requires host families to introduce visiting teen-agers to a 
local police and fire department, and encourages other civic-oriented field 
trips as well. The idea is to show the students how authorities operate in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"After a few weeks, they remark about how there's no stop points, no barbed 
wire around police stations," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Over a diet soda on a recent hot afternoon at an ice cream parlor in Sierra 
Madre, Jean said that if more students knew about the program, "there would be 
a long list. Everybody wants to come to America." 
</P>
<P>
Project organizers hope that the teen-agers will forge lasting friendships that 
will one day have a healing effect in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the only way to start is through the children. And they deserve more 
than what they're getting," said Eileen Kane, the organization's Northern 
Ireland coordinator. "If we can touch them and start to change their attitudes, 
hopefully, 10 years down the road, this will have real impact." 
</P>
<P>
Jean, who is a touch gregarious, and Joanna, who is slightly shy, say they will 
write to the Duffys and stay in contact with each other after they return home 
tomorrow. "We're all going to remain friends," Jean said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
And that, Kane said, is what it's all about.

BOLSHOI BALLET OFFERS 'SWAN LAKE' AT SHRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After many a season tires the swan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Bolshoi Ballet has been performing Yuri Grigorovich's streamlined, 
hyperactive distortion of "Swan Lake" since 1969. No wonder everyone on the 
vast stage of Shrine Auditorium looked a trifle bored Tuesday night. Some of 
the crowd out front seemed a tad dispirited, too. 
</P>
<P>
This dubious production last surfaced at the Shrine in 1979. Absence has made 
neither art nor heart grow fonder. 
</P>
<P>
This, you may recall, is the "Swan Lake" that pretends to tell a story but 
keeps forgetting to do so. This is a neo-Soviet "Swan Lake," sans mime, with 
happy ending appended. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother, whose deportment is worthy of a tough-cookie showgirl, 
doesn't give her growing boy a bow and arrow on his birthday, just a necklace. 
He doesn't seem to like it (can't blame him), for he fails to thank her and 
doesn't bother to wear it long. Joining convenient ballerina-playmates, he is 
more interested in usurping the danseur's duties in a pas de trois formerly 
reserved for his serfs or courtiers. 
</P>
<P>
That is just the beginning. Our Muscovite Prince doesn't go a-hunting. Odette 
doesn't seem to be a swan, just another white-tutued ballerina, and she doesn't 
even get to make her usual dramatic entrance. There is no pressure for the 
droopy and distracted Siegfried to choose a bride in the ball scene, and he 
doesn't bother to observe the contenders' divertissements. 
</P>
<P>
Odile, the good ballerina's bad alter ego, comes equipped with a entourage of 
six black ersatz-swans. They turn out to be merely decorative. 
</P>
<P>
Rothbart, who sports neither red hair nor beard, goes in for a lot of fancy 
dancing. Often echoing Siegfried's steps, he functions as the good guy's bad 
alter ego. Don't ask why. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional "Swan Lake" addicts will, of course, recognize most of the exalted 
Petipa and Ivanov choreography. Those familiar with Soviet revisionism will 
recognize Alexander Gorsky's infernal, irrelevant, anti-musical Jester, a 
circus acrobat who clutters the first scene and invariably garners the greatest 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Grigorovich, arch proponent of the more-is-more school, interpolates an odd 
adagio routine for Odile and her not-so-fine-feathered accomplices just before 
the Black Swan pas de deux. That is just one of many instances where he 
overloads the action with meaningless motion. 
</P>
<P>
Abetted by his ubiquitous designer, Simon Virsaladze, he confines the ballet to 
a gauzy unit set that repeatedly sinks into the crack separating realism from 
abstraction. The fluid scenic arrangement does have one major advantage, 
however: It allows the sprawling ballet to proceed with only a single 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The opening cast promised much on paper. Few promises, alas, were fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Ludmila Semenyaka danced Odette-Odile with her wonted clarity, intelligence and 
style. At 38, she remains a ballerina of undoubted authority, and, despite some 
technical inequities, she still dispatches those ornamented fouettes with elan. 
</P>
<P>
She did little, however, to differentiate between the innocent and the evil 
heroines. She sometimes seemed to be performing by rote. Her lyrical phrasing, 
moreover, seems to have lost some of its erstwhile suavity, and her bravura 
flights now tend toward the effortful. Perhaps she needs a loftier inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
For all his noble attitudes, Alexei Fadeyechev didn't appear to be much 
involved in the dilemmas that should confront Siegfried. He struck valiant 
poses, danced neatly if a bit ponderously, partnered the ballerina 
sympathetically, and, bowing to Grigorovich's imbalances, left the high-powered 
leaping and spinning to Rothbart and the Jester. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Peretokin leapt and spun with crisp precision as Rothbart. Mikhail Sharkov 
leapt and spun with flamboyant extroversion as the Jester. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Bilova and Natalia Arkhipova used their opportunities in the pas de trois 
for fleeting star-turns. Elvira Drozdova (the Russian would-be bride) and Nina 
Speranskaya (her Polish counterpart) attracted special attention in the 
national dances. The magnetic Gedeminas Taranda was wasted in the non-duties of 
the Master of Ceremonies, and the muscular Alexei Lazarev -- who had appeared 
in central roles on the last tour -- was buried here among the Prince's 
incidental attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The all-important corps de ballet, subjected to a grueling work schedule, 
didn't seem to set much value on unanimity of gesture. The rival Kirov still 
outclasses the Bolshoi when it comes to the mass production of perfect swans 
and cygnets. 
</P>
<P>
Algis Zhuraitis conducted the competent pit orchestra with little concern for 
nuance, much concern for the dancers' eccentric tempos. 
</P>
<P>
The near-capacity audience in the 6,300-seat hall applauded wildly whenever 
aerial feats loomed. The crowd responded dutifully when, even in the middle of 
a pas de deux, the dancers milked the house for non-spontaneous ovations. 
</P>

Foster Heads to Aspen Hills: Announced Tuesday as the ninth music director in 
the 42-year history of the Aspen Music Festival and School, American conductor 
Lawrence Foster said Wednesday, "This job means more to me than any other in 
this country." Foster has visited the festival almost every year since 1955, 
when he first attended as a 14-year-old piano student. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-born Foster, now 48, just completed his last season as music 
director of the Monte Carlo Philharmonic. In September, he takes over 
directorship of the Jerusalem Symphony, to which he is committed for 10 weeks 
annually. His new Aspen contract runs for three years. A regular visitor to Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera, Foster's next Music Center assignment is Richard 
Strauss' "Elektra" in February. BETH KLEID

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: GUITARIST AL DIMEOLA LONGS FOR RETURN 
TO FOREVER DAYS 
</P>

<P>
Fourteen years after the breakup of Return to Forever, guitarist Al DiMeola 
still misses being a member of the seminal electric jazz band led by Chick 
Corea. DiMeola, in fact, still harbors hopes of a reunion with former band 
mates Corea, the piano and keyboard player, drummer Lenny White and bassist 
Stanley Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most ridiculous thing for Chick to ever break up the group," said 
DiMeola, who plays the Bacchanal at 8:30 Monday. "I have expressed this to 
Chick, and I know Stanley and Lenny feel strongly, too. I've met with Chick, 
and Stanley's met with him. We've tried to talk sense into him, but I think we 
have a Scientology problem to deal with, possibly due to Stanley leaving 
Scientology. That doesn't sit very well with Chick." 
</P>
<P>
Corea is an acknowledged devotee of the self-improvement movement founded by 
the late L. Ron Hubbard. When Clarke gave up Scientology, Corea broke up the 
group after the "Romantic Warrior" album. 
</P>
<P>
"We had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with CBS, but Chick decided to go in 
a different direction," DiMeola said. 
</P>
<P>
His disappointment is understandable. He hasn't recorded on his own since the 
1987 album "Tirami Su." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very strange. I've talked to labels like GRP, and I haven't gotten a 
response at all. Which is bizarre. All I can tell you is that the majority of 
what I've heard coming from that label is extremely boring. I have a demo worth 
of material which is as strong or stronger than anything I've ever done, and 
I've sold close to 5 million records. I'm right up there with some of the 
best-selling jazz artists around -- worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
DiMeola is playing San Diego with his World Sinfonia, a quartet also including 
classical guitarist Chris Carrington and percussionists Arto Tuncboyaci and 
Gumbi Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard Chris 10 years ago at a club in Dallas, and I always had it in mind to 
do something with him. The magic in this particular group is the spontaneity. 
We leave lots of room for improvisation, and we have a real good rapport, 
especially with the percussionists." 
</P>
<P>
The songs are mostly DiMeola's, but the group also tackles DiMeola's 
arrangements of other pieces. 
</P>
<P>
In November, DiMeola plans to hit the road with a new electric band. The group 
will hone material for an album he hopes to record by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of DiMeola is guitarist Larry Carlton, who has a seven-album deal 
with GRP. Carlton's career spans more than 20 years of solo projects and 
prodigious studio work with Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, John Lennon, Jerry 
Garcia, Neil Diamond, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, mostly during the early 
'70s. And of course there was his tenure with The Crusaders, the funky jazz 
band, from 1971 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton's album "Collection," released this year, is a compilation of 20 years 
of his music, including such signature tunes as "Nite Crawler" and "Minute by 
Minute." He said he plans to play many of his light-jazz radio hits in San 
Diego next Wednesday night during shows at 6 and 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
Guitar virtuoso Stanley Jordan, whose patented "tapping" technique wows 
listeners, will share the bill. By tapping the strings with the fingers of both 
hands, an effect which almost makes the guitar a keyboard instrument, Jordan 
gets a symphonic sound which seems impossible from a single human being. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will be a homecoming for San Diego saxophonist Hollis Gentry, who 
left his local band Neon to join Carlton's band last year. 
</P>
<P>
Flutists have seldom made it big as leaders, but Dave Valentin seems a rare 
exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
'If you look back historically at flute players, you'll find Eric Dolphy, James 
Moody, Yusef Lateef, Hubert Laws and Herbie Mann, not necessarily in that 
order. Many, like Moody and Dolphy, doubled on saxophones. But I think Herbie 
Mann was able to make the flute a legitimate lead instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I'm an aggressive player. But I would like to show the public that 
the flute has a whole texture of colors and sounds." 
</P>
<P>
Valentin and his group stop at Elario's Monday and Tuesday nights for shows at 
8:30 and 10:30 as part of a West Coast tour. After all this talk about GRP, 
it's worth noting that Valentin was the first artist signed to the label 11 
years ago.

Nelson Sues: Country singer Willie Nelson filed a $45-million suit in a Dallas 
federal court on Wednesday alleging a violation of the racketeering law by his 
former accounting firm, Price Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jay Goldberg, Nelson's attorney, the suit alleges that the 
prestigious international accounting firm, acting as Nelson's investment and 
tax advisers, had engaged in a persistent pattern of fraud since 1979, 
including making inappropriate investments that lost substantial sums of money. 
"If the allegations are proven, this will be a terrible breach of fiduciary 
duties by one of the most prestigious accounting firms in the country," 
Goldberg said. Efforts to reach a spokesman for the accounting firm were 
unsuccessful. BETH KLEID

LO-TEC TO GIVE ALL-MALE CONCERT, FOR A CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: THREE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO MODERN DANCE WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED BY THREE 
NEW YORK PERFORMERS.

<P>
The title of this weekend's Lo-Tec concert is "Made in New York." But a better 
description of the two performances scheduled for Three's Company's Hillcrest 
studio this weekend might be "Man-Made in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Men have been conspicuously absent from most of Three's Company's Lo-Tecs this 
summer. And even on those rare occasions when men were around, they were 
heavily outnumbered by women. 
</P>
<P>
Not so this weekend. Ron Brown, Albert Reid and Richard Haisma are flying in 
from New York City to perform Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Brown will perform his provocative solo, "Next," and a new one he calls "The 
Gift." 
</P>
<P>
Haisma has a suite of popular solos to showcase. 
</P>
<P>
Reid will make two solo appearances and perform with a trio of Three's Company 
dancers in "Corral." 
</P>
<P>
A two-week workshop at Three's Company brought Brown to San Diego earlier this 
month, and he found himself inspired. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete surprise to me that I would do a new piece while I'm here," 
he said in a break from teaching class, "but the two Terries (Terry Wilson and 
Terri Shipman) are so beautiful I'd like to use them in New York when I do the 
piece, if they could come." 
</P>
<P>
Brown will introduce "Next," the dance that provoked Deborah Jowitt of the 
Village Voice to say, "You watch his body the way you listen to someone saying 
something important and true." The respected dance critic praised Brown's 
choreography as well -- for its "strong yet variegated movements." 
</P>
<P>
The dancer himself described "Next" (a piece that culminates with a nude image 
at the far end of the stage) as "so contemporary, it doesn't pull any punches. 
It's about a character not having control of his death or his destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Brown -- an emotion-charged, Jose Limon-based dancer -- peels off layers of 
clothing during the dance as a metaphor for "stripping away, as we feel there 
is nothing left to lose. The image is very stark," he said, "but I've never 
shocked anyone, because the character is so vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Haisma, who performs one-third of the program, wasn't planning to arrive in San 
Diego until dress rehearsal, but he talked about his role in this 
male-dominated program by telephone from New York last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we're all independent artists," Haisma said. "I've never worked with 
the other two before, and our work stems from different traditions." 
</P>
<P>
Though Haisma's modern dance background springs from the Murray Louis line, his 
own choreography is more theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is much more emotional and much more musical. Some of it is very 
sensual, but I can't separate myself from my ideas." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Haisma's "Six Short Dreams," will incorporate "political elements, 
dark elements and absurd elements -- a whole range of ideas," as Haisma 
described the suite. "I've done the concert several times. I just did it in New 
York Friday night, and the response was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Reid, the third link in this disjointed chain of male choreographers, made a 
detour to Santa Barbara on his way to this week's Lo-Tec concert. But, in a 
telephone interview earlier this week, he confided his misgivings about being 
teamed up with dancers he doesn't even know. "I don't generally (share a 
program)," Reid said. "This could be terrible, but I'm gambling that it will be 
interesting for the audience to see a wide range of modern dance." 
</P>
<P>
Reid is doing his part to ensure variety on this weekend's triple bill. The 
long-time Cunningham dancer-teacher will perform two Cunninghamesque solos -- 
tailored to his own idiosyncratic taste. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is like Cunningham's, but more lyrical. I like to dance with the 
music, and I don't use chance," he assured, distancing himself from two of his 
mentor's trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm using three dancers from Three's Company for another piece," Reid noted. 
"Dancers who studied with me three years ago when I taught a workshop in San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
As Reid noted, this kind of mixed bill has built-in risks. But one way or the 
other -- by putting the accent on men -- the event should fill a void on the 
local concert dance scene.

DE FRANCESCO TURNS BACK CLOCK ON A GENRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the 1950s and '60s, a form of jazz flourished in which the dominant 
figure played Hammond organ, the prevailing mood was the blues, and the sidemen 
were a saxophonist, a guitarist and a drummer. With the arrival of Joey de 
Francesco, who opened Tuesday at Hollywood's Catalina Bar and Grill, the clock 
has turned back and this engaging soul-jazz genre is with us again. 
</P>
<P>
This is a surprising development in two ways: first, the organ has been in a 
decline for years, with the synthesizer more or less taking its place, and 
second, De Francesco is much too young to remember anything about the idiom. He 
was born April 10, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
From the first 12 bars of the opening tune -- a blues, of course -- it was 
evident that De Francesco has studied and mastered this idiom to an improbable 
degree. Here is a throwback to Jimmy Smith and all those others who set the 
pattern two decades before he was born. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the great organists, this precocious teen-ager not only possesses a 
fast mind, limning long, captivating blues lines, but also a busy foot that 
plays the bass parts on the chromatic pedals. Any organist worth his salt in 
this field scorned the use of a bass player. 
</P>
<P>
De Francesco is also a master of dynamic contrast. Some tunes would build up to 
a triple forte, sink back to a barely audible triple-piano, then back again, 
like a sonic roller coaster. At one point he established a laid-back beat 
reminiscent of Errol Garner. 
</P>
<P>
His sidemen (Glenn Guidone on tenor and soprano saxes, Jim Henry on trumpet and 
fluegelhorn, Paul Bollenbak on guitar, Byron Landham on drums) are all older 
men -- that is to say, men probably over 20 -- who have developed styles 
ideally suited to the leader's requirements. Henry was particularly effective 
on "Round Midnight" and a somewhat overbusy but commendably adventurous "My 
Romance." 
</P>
<P>
These Young Turks move back through the decades with grace and conviction -- 
old blues like "Red Top" and old pop songs like "It Had To Be You" seemed to be 
second nature to them. This is an example of youthful maturity, as impressive 
on its own level as Wynton Marsalis' explosion on the jazz scene a decade ago. 
The quintet closes Sunday.

TURKISH CUISINE; 
</P>
<P>
A DATE WITH HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is Turkish food: Peppery radishes in a hummus-like sesame dressing. 
Grilled quail, faintly sweet-sour from marinating in tomatoes, yogurt, olive 
oil and cinnamon. Mastic ice cream, with an exotic flavor something like Juicy 
Fruit gum; on the side, apricots stuffed with toasted almonds and slightly 
soured cream so thick it's almost butter. 
</P>
<P>
It may be little known in this country, but in the last few years, European 
foodies have been discovering Turkish cuisine, and in the process a remarkable 
food writer named Nevin Halici (her name is pronounced something like "Neveen 
Halaja"). "Nevin Halici's Turkish Cookbook," recently printed in England, is 
the first book by a Turkish cookery writer ever translated into English. The 
food heavies see her as a sort of Turkish Paul Prudhomme. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she is not really anybody's image of a cookbook writer. The daughter 
of a Sufi family long associated with the Mevlevi Order (known in the West as 
the Whirling Dervishes), she is very much a traditional Muslim woman who wears 
long-sleeved dresses and covers her hair with a sort of pleated turban. Some 
people have the feeling that if the veil weren't illegal in Turkey, she'd 
prefer to wear it. 
</P>
<P>
But her quiet, pious manner should not lead anyone to underestimate her. 
Halici's English may be halting, but it represents a triumph over centuries of 
family opposition to educating women. And if that doesn't impress you, I have 
seen her get a provincial Turkish Air Lines agent to change a plane reservation 
in under half an hour, simply by an invincible sort of gentle persistence. 
</P>
<P>
She is a diligent researcher and has published book-length studies in Turkish 
of her country's various regional cuisines, which are quite various indeed. Two 
years ago at a symposium on food history in Istanbul, she read a paper on the 
little-known poppy-based cuisine of Turkey's traditional opium-growing area -- 
a cuisine likely to disappear because of the Turkish government's campaign to 
restrict opium-growing. 
</P>
<P>
And she is certainly an excellent cook. At a dinner she prepared for the 
American Institute of Wine and Food in San Francisco some months ago, she made 
a very ancient pasta dating from the days when the Turks were nomads in Central 
Asia. Called manti, it is tiny triangular lamb ravioli cooked in a mixture of 
lamb stock and garlicky yogurt sauce. Her version was dashingly topped with 
reduced tomatoes, sage and mint. 
</P>
<P>
She also made a tomato-sweetened eggplant salad that was subtly enfolded in a 
roasted pepper, and a bulgur wheat pilaf with onions, green peppers, tomato and 
mint, but her repertoire includes far more exotic dishes. One that she didn't 
make for this dinner is Perdeli Pilav, a sort of chicken pilaf baked in a thin 
crust which looks like a cake when it's done but has a rich flavor of chicken 
and rice. Another is Tavuk Gogsu Kazandibi, a traditional Turkish pudding 
flavored with an ingredient no one ever guesses: shredded chicken breast. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular course at the San Francisco dinner was a variation on the 
famous dish imam bayildi ("the imam fainted with delight"), where quinces, 
instead of eggplants, were stuffed with the traditional filling of lamb, 
currants and rice, achieving a dish of stunning richness. Contrasting with it 
was a subtle and exquisite side dish that was simply leeks very slowly stewed 
in olive oil with a bit of tomato. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meal, she apologized for shortcomings in the food, which most 
of the diners were in no position to recognize. The American white beans, for 
instance, were really too small for the white bean salad. California radishes 
are not as sharply flavored as Turkey's, and California rice takes longer to 
cook, so the rice in the quince dish was not properly done by her lights. 
</P>
<P>
Diners also learned that this scholar of Turkish food tradition makes her own 
innovations. The idea of using quinces instead of eggplants in the variation on 
imam bayildi was hers, so she had decided to name it Claudia bayildi, since it 
was the Middle Eastern food expert Claudia Roden -- rather than an imam -- who 
practically fainted with delight on tasting it. Someone asked her why she cut 
her leeks lengthwise, rather than crosswise, as would be instinctive for a 
Western chef, and she explained that in her experience it exposed more surface 
to the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
At this point her English began to give out on her, and the husband of the 
Turkish Honorary Consul encouraged her, saying, "Go ahead, we will listen 
carefully." She smiled gravely and replied, "If you will listen carefully, I 
will answer in Turkish," and lapsed into the introspective harmonies of her own 
tongue. If that quiet, pious face could show impishness, at that moment it did.

 This celebrated Istanbul dessert is for open minds. It uses chicken breast as 
a dessert flavoring, as did the medieval European dessert blanc manger.

<P>
(Chicken Breast Pudding) 
</P>
<P>
1 small chicken breast 
</P>
<P>
Water 
</P>
<P>
1 quart milk 
</P>
<P>
1 cup rice flour or ground rice 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Place chicken breast in small saucepan and add water to cover. Cook over medium 
heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and soak chicken in bowl of cold 
water until cool. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Cut lengthwise into 4 or 
5 strips. 
</P>
<P>
Hold ends of each strip with fingers and rub to separate meat into fibers. 
Continue rubbing towards center of strip so that it is entirely separated into 
fine shreds. Place shreds in cold water and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Heat milk gently to boiling. Quickly stir in rice flour. Simmer 15 minutes, 
stirring continuously. Add granulated sugar and cook 10 minutes longer, still 
stirring. Add drained chicken breast fibers and cook another 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Heat 10-inch heavy skillet over low heat. Add butter to melt. Add chicken 
mixture and pat with hands or rubber spatula until round, then smooth with flat 
of knife. Brown underside carefully over low heat, about 20 minutes, shaking 
pan from time to time. Turn onto serving plate. When cool, sprinkle lightly 
with powdered sugar and cut into rectangles and serve. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If superfine sugar is unavailable, place 7 ounces granulated sugar in 
blender container and blend on high speed until very fine.

TURKISH CUISINE; 
</P>
<P>
MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW AS MIDDLE EASTERN FOOD ORIGINATED IN ISTANBUL

<P>
What do Americans know about Turkish cuisine? Practically nothing. In the film 
"Midnight Express," a character described the local food he'd eaten in Istanbul 
as "crap," and American audiences didn't laugh the movie off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
They would have if they'd ever actually been in Istanbul. The former capital of 
the Ottoman Empire is remarkable for the high standard of its restaurant food. 
Istanbul happens to be a city where you'd actually have to work to find a bad 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been a home of sophisticated dining. For nearly 500 years it was 
the capital of the vast Ottoman Empire, and for more than 1,000 years before 
that the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The finest ingredients of an empire 
always flowed there. Even today, an Istanbul shop owner would never dare insult 
his customers by offering produce out of season or any but the freshest fish, 
and a little hole-in-the-wall delicatessen may stock 15 or 20 varieties of 
Turkish honey, bottled and in the comb, often identified by the villages it 
came from. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of refinement of cooking technique, there are those who rank Turkish 
cuisine with French and Chinese. Before World War I, any self-respecting great 
house in Istanbul employed not one but two specialists to made the pastry we 
call filo. One made it only for the miniature pies called borek; the other made 
only a more delicate variety suitable for baklava. 
</P>
<P>
The Turks are, in fact, a food-obsessed people. Their most famous mystical 
poet, the founder of the Mevlevi Dervishes, mentions scores of dishes in his 
works (including the eggplant dish imam bayildi). A Mevlevi postulant was 
required to spend three days in the kitchen of a tekke (Sufi monastery), 
observing the disciplined workings of the kitchen staff from a cubbyhole, 
before he could be considered for initiation into the order. 
</P>
<P>
Most of what we know as Middle Eastern food originated in Istanbul: the 
elaborate shish kebab repertoire, the stuffed vegetables (dolmas), complicated 
eggplant dishes such as musakka, filo pastries. It is fitting that Turkish 
dishes are held in common by Arabs, Greeks, Yugoslavs and Armenians, because 
these dishes were invented by a cosmopolitan society. 
</P>
<P>
When Sultan Mehmet I conquered Constantinople in 1453, he saw it as the future 
capital of a world empire and decided to repopulate it accordingly. Half the 
population of the metropolis would be Turks; the rest would be people of other 
nationalities. That is, people from nations either already ruled by the Ottoman 
Turks or, as Mehmet saw it, destined to be. 
</P>
<P>
He offered them the chance to rise with the new world capital, he lured them in 
with free land and tax breaks, and when that wasn't enough he simply had people 
kidnaped to fulfill the quota. Within a couple of years, the streets of the 
newly renamed city of Istanbul were thronged with Turks, Arabs, Persians, 
Greeks, Bulgarians, Circassians, Armenians and many more -- even Russians, 
Italians and Frenchmen. Numbers of Spanish Jews, fleeing the Inquisition, made 
their new home in Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
Nations that had scarcely heard of each other were in daily contact now. It was 
probably the greatest experience of culture shock before our century. Within a 
generation, a distinct new Ottoman style had arisen in all the decorative arts. 
At the same time, a new cuisine was invented at the royal palace in Istanbul, 
one that had absorbed literally countless elements from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who visits the Topkapi Palace gets a glimpse of its 10 large kitchens. 
They employed so many hundreds of men that the confectioners had their own 
mosque, separate from the mosque used by the cooks. It was probably in these 
kitchens that some forgotten pastry chef came up with the idea of taking yufka, 
the traditional tortilla of the nomadic Central Asian Turks, and stretching it 
paper-thin, thereby inventing filo. 
</P>
<P>
We still enjoy the blessings of those vast palace kitchens, because 80% of the 
chefs in Istanbul are descended from palace chefs. What you eat in Istanbul 
today is an unbroken tradition from the cookery of the sultans. That's what 
people should have been shouting at the screen during "Midnight Express."

Best bet so far has been red cabbage, which fades only 20%.

Bulgaria produces 3 billion bottles of beer yearly, one third of that being a 
brand called Zagorka. Two months ago, Alex Kraychev, a Bulgarian former Olympic 
weightlifter who defected to this country in 1978, started importing Zagorka 
(hoppy with a bitter finish, like a Mexican beer) along with a companion brand, 
Astika (exotic clove-like aroma). His slogan: The First Two Over the Wall.

The Krups kitchen utensil company recently sponsored a survey of newly married 
or soon-to-be-married men about what sort of kitchen equipment they'd prefer to 
get as wedding presents. They had surprisingly specific tastes: 63% said a 
microwave, 52% a food processor, 42% a set of knives; 20% wanted an espresso 
machine. The present most likely to be returned was a fondue maker. 
</P>

Incidentally, 87% of all men -- 97% of Southern men -- said they planned to 
share kitchen responsibilities with their wives. Time will tell.

In a region that boasts some of the heartiest food and long-lived red wines in 
Italy, you'd be hard pressed to find anybody more enthusiastic about food and 
wine than Barbera producer Giacomo Bologna. He's even named his string of 
racehorses after Sassacaia, Ca' del Bosco, Coltassala and other favorite wines. 
An affable, larger-than-life figure, Bologna is a one-man guide to the cooking 
of Piemonte, Italy, and the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
Bologna manages to work wine and food, and especially the cooking of Piemonte, 
into every conversation. He'll bring up tajerin (the region's hand-cut 
noodles), the agnolotti stuffed with roasted meats and herbs, the special veal 
used for carpaccio and a hand-chopped raw veal salad. But when the talk veers 
to bagna cauda, you can almost see his eyes register cardoons, peppers, celery, 
garlic, artichokes, one after the other until the images stop at peppers and 
white truffle. Jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Piemonte's bagna cauda is a "hot bath" of olive oil, anchovies and 
plenty of garlic in a terra cotta pot warmed over embers (or a chafing-dish 
arrangement) in the center of the table. As diners dip a succession of 
vegetables into the bagna cauda and wash it down with spritzy young Barbera, it 
becomes an impromptu festa. For the Piemontese, bagna cauda is not just a 
recipe; it's an event. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch at his winery in Rochetta Tanaro, Bologna gives this version of the 
dish's origins: "One day a cook who was with Napoleon's army didn't have 
anything to feed his troops, so he improvised with staples he had on hand. He 
cooked some garlic and some anchovies in olive oil and gathered some of the 
vegetables available in that season. The soldiers 'bathed' the fall and winter 
vegetables in the enormous pan of sauce he had warming over the fire. The 
makeshift dish was a great success, and bagna cauda came to be considered a 
piatto di amicizia or dish of friendship, because everyone dips their 
vegetables into a common pot." 
</P>
<P>
Two vegetables are essential: cardoons and sweet red peppers. An edible thistle 
native to the Mediterranean, the cardoon is cultivated under banks of earth 
like celery or Belgian endive. The Piemontese prize a dwarf variety called 
cardi gobbi or "hunchback" because of its contorted shape. Pale ivory, with a 
delicate, sweet taste, it is grown near Nizza Monferrato southeast of Asti. 
</P>
<P>
"And then you need raw or roasted sweet red and yellow peppers," Bologna adds, 
"or the special peppers we put up every fall. When we draw the new wine off the 
grapeskins, we take the skins that are still impregnated with the wine, and add 
them to a demijohn filled with large peppers. The peppers slowly pickle, taking 
on the perfume and a subtle taste of vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
"All sorts of seasonal vegetables are part of the elaborate still life too: 
celery, sweet fennel and bouquets of radishes and violet-tipped artichokes. 
Cabbages, and salad greens, especially bitter greens such as arugula or 
radicchio, can also be included. Beets baked in their jacket, and whole roasted 
onions are part of the assemblage," he says, stirring the olive wood fire 
blazing in the waist-high hearth. 
</P>
<P>
Bologna's wife, Anna, who worked with his mother in the family restaurant for 
years, ladles the bagna cauda sauce into a terra cotta bowl that fits into the 
saunfetta, a chafing-dish arrangement forged by the local blacksmith. The heat 
is provided by embers from the olive wood fire. "This saunfetta is perfect for 
bagna cauda," Bologna says, "because it fills the room with the enticing 
perfume of wood. It's designed with enough space between the embers and the 
terra cotta pot so that the sauce doesn't burn, which is very important." 
</P>
<P>
The golden green sauce gives off a heady aroma of garlic. Anna Bologna's recipe 
uses a whopping pound of garlic for every liter of extra-virgin olive oil. She 
cooks it slowly just until the oil is suffused with the taste of garlic and the 
anchovies have melted into the sauce. "The secret of making a good bagna 
cauda," she says, "is to use the best-quality olive oil and anchovies." She 
prefers a light, fragrant extra-virgin oil from Liguria. The same region 
produces the salted anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
Tucking in a linen napkin so that it covers his ample front, Bologna 
demonstrates the proper technique for eating a bagna cauda. From the platter at 
the center of the table, he spears some cardoons and pickled peppers with his 
fork and dips them into the pungent sauce. The idea is to convey the vegetables 
from the pot to your mouth without dripping sauce all over the table; this you 
do by tracking every bite with a piece of bread. Some people like to dip in and 
out fast; others prefer to leave certain vegetables to warm through or cook 
just a little in the pot. "Use a fork or your fingers to dip the vegetables in 
the sauce, whichever is easiest," Bologna advises. 
</P>
<P>
"Every November," he says, "we taste the new wine with bagna cauda. It goes 
very well with this lusty, full-flavored dish." He also serves the most recent 
vintage of La Monella, a young, slightly spritzy Barbera. Before Nebbiolo 
became fashionable, every father put away some bottles of Barbera when his son 
was born to celebrate his coming of age at 18. "It's a wine that has been and 
still is our milk in this region," said Bologna. "Barbera is the traditional 
wine for bagna cauda, because its lively fruit helps to wash down the pungent 
sauce, which can be a little heavy." 
</P>
<P>
At the end, when only a little sauce is left in the bagna cauda pot, it's usual 
to break an egg into the pot for each person, and let it cook very slowly. "And 
-- if you are lucky enough to have a white truffle," he says dramatically, as 
he unwraps a blue-and-white handkerchief to reveal a handsome example, "you 
shave it over the eggs." He does -- and the room fills with the powerful scent 
of truffle. This is real Piemontese soul food, and the grand finale to a 
blissful feast for garlic lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cups or one liter of olive oil for six people may seem like a lot, but 
somehow a great deal of sauce seems to disappear. If you do have some leftover 
sauce, Bologna suggests having vegetables with Bagna Cauda for a snack for a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The best olive oil for Bagna Cauda is light, fragrant extra-virgin olive oil 
from Liguria. Tuscan oils and oils from the south of Italy are too strongly 
flavored for the sauce, while some California olive oils can taste heavy. 
Catalan olive oil from Spain is also a good choice. Salt-packed anchovies are 
sold in bulk at some Italian groceries or international delicatessens. If you 
use anchovy fillets in oil, rinse well and add small amount at a time, since 
these are generally saltier and stronger tasting than salt-packed anchovies. 
Remember the weight in the recipe refers to whole salt-packed anchovies, so use 
much less if you are weighing out fillets only. 
</P>
<P>
BAGNA CAUDA WITH VEGETABLES 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound whole salt-packed anchovies 
</P>
<P>
2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound (about 4 heads) garlic cloves, peeled 
</P>
<P>
Assorted Vegetables 
</P>
<P>
1 or 2 eggs per person, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
Small white truffle, optional 
</P>
<P>
Under running water, fillet whole anchovies, washing away all salt. Remove 
scales and intestines from anchovies if needed. Pat dry, roughly chop, and set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil and butter in heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic 
until lightly golden. Add anchovies and cook gently, stirring, until anchovies 
dissolve into sauce, about 15 to 20 minutes. (Be careful not to burn garlic.) 
Pass sauce through fine sieve. 
</P>
<P>
Keep sauce warm in chafing pot and serve with Assorted Vegetables. When 
everyone is sated on vegetables, and only small amount sauce remains in pot, 
break 1 or 2 eggs for each person into bubbling sauce. Cover and cook few 
minutes. When eggs begin to set, break yolks with fork and gently stir. (Eggs 
should be soft curds.) Shave white truffle over cooked eggs just before 
serving. Makes 6 servings.

BREAD MAKES THE DIFFERENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
A good loaf of bread is harder to come by than a great sandwich filling. 
Whether you are serving a humble peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a 
sophisticated lobster club, the quality of the bread is important. 
</P>
<P>
So is freshness: The best breads have no preservatives and a low proportion of 
fat, causing them to stale quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you make your own bread or search out the best in bakeries, you can 
count on the freezer to keep your loaf in good shape until you're ready to use 
it. Freezing bread properly is easy to do once you know the specifics. Here's 
how: 
</P>
<P>
* Freeze bread while very fresh but completely cool. 
</P>
<P>
* Place a loaf of bread in the freezer, unwrapped, until just frozen solid 
(waiting to wrap the bread until it's frozen reduces, if not prevents, the 
formation of ice crystals). 
</P>
<P>
* Once frozen, it is necessary to double wrap the loaf of bread in two 
separately tied plastic bags to prevent freezer burn and off-freezer odors. 
Place the loaf of bread in a plastic bag, squeeze out all the air and twist the 
top of the bag into a tight coil. Fold coiled part over itself; seal tightly 
with a twist tie. Repeat the bagging a second time. This package is airtight, 
making it possible to successfully freeze the loaf for as long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
* For the best thawing results, thaw at room temperature, keeping the loaf of 
bread in its wrappings. ABBY MANDEL

SANDWICHES: A SUMMER ALTERNATIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Salads have long been the mainstay of light, summer meals. But now sandwiches 
are starting to nudge salads aside. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of reasons for our renewed interest in sandwiches. We are now 
nutritionally savvy enough to know that bread is indeed the staff of life. Some 
of us are such bread fans, in fact, that the filling has become secondary to 
the quality of the bread that holds it. 
</P>
<P>
And a sandwich makes a much more satisfying meal than a salad -- even when the 
latter is accompanied by bread. A good sandwich is comforting too -- which 
can't be said for salads. And for summer entertaining a few simple, substantial 
sandwiches made with great bread are much easier to put together for a crowd 
than a main dish salad. 
</P>
<P>
Like most culinary preparations, successful sandwiches respond to seasonal 
ingredients. The following sandwiches brim over with fresh, crunchy, refreshing 
fillings; you might even say that they're salads between bread. 
</P>
<P>
 A summer-perfect, fresh-tasting sandwich is an Italian mix of sun-ripened 
tomato, red onion, young fennel and basil stuffed into a soft pita bread. For 
my taste, I prefer pita bread that is softened and warmed through, best 
achieved in the microwave oven on medium power (50%) with the bread wrapped in 
paper towels. The timing depends on how many pita breads are heated at once; 
it's usually 20 seconds per pita.

2 large tomatoes (about 13 ounces) seeded and cut into 1/3-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
1 large red onion (about 7 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 large sweet red pepper (about 8 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
1 young fennel bulb (about 7 ounces), trimmed and cut into 1/3-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
6 young spinach leaves, julienned 
</P>
<P>
20 large fresh basil leaves, julienned 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons grainy Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 softened pita breads, cut in halves crosswise 
</P>
<P>
Combine tomatoes, red onion, red pepper, fennel, spinach and basil in 2-quart 
bowl. Toss well to mix. 
</P>
<P>
Combine balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mustard, sugar and salt in small bowl, mix 
well. Season to taste with pepper. Add to vegetables. Toss gently to combine. 
Refrigerate 2 hours to let flavors develop. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, drain off excess juices. Adjust seasonings to taste. Fill 
each pita half with about 2/3 cup vegetables. Makes 6 pita halves. 
</P>
<P>
 Large lavash crackers make the best sandwich spiral slices; first, the 
crackers are softened with water, then covered with fresh ingredients, rolled 
up jellyroll-fashion and later sliced. They are the perfect answer to light 
dining, making a great presentation on a buffet table. They are also easy 
finger foods. Thinly sliced ingredients and/or spreads are the ideal fillers. 
In this straightforward recipe, cilantro adds zest; substitute fresh basil or 
tarragon, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
SMOKED TURKEY AND HAM LAVASH CLUB WITH CILANTRO 
</P>
<P>
1 large (15-inch round) sesame seed lavash cracker 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons honey mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound very thinly sliced lightly smoked turkey 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound very thinly sliced hickory smoked ham 
</P>
<P>
1 large tomato, very thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 sweet onion (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced and separated into rings 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
8 large leaf lettuce leaves, core removed 
</P>
<P>
To soften lavash cracker, hold cracker under cold running water and thoroughly 
wet both sides. Place between 2 damp clean towels 45 to 60 minutes. Be sure 
lavash is softened enough to roll up without cracking. If still too dry, 
sprinkle with more water, then cover again with damp towels until soft and 
pliable. 
</P>
<P>
Center softened lavash, sesame seed side down, on plastic wrap, 3 inches longer 
than lavash. Spread honey mustard evenly over cracker. Top with layers of 
sliced turkey, ham, tomato (in single layer) and onion rings. Sprinkle with 
cilantro leaves. Cover with lettuce leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Use plastic wrap to help roll cracker up into compact roll, jellyroll-fashion. 
Move roll to center of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly, including ends. Refrigerate 
2 to 4 hours before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Serve cold, unwrap and use serrated knife to slice roll crosswise into 1 
3/4-inch spirals. Makes 4 servings, 8 spiral slices. 
</P>
<P>
Here, shrimp is combined with apples and cucumbers, not only stretching the 
shrimp but giving the sandwich great flavor and crunch. Fresh sourdough bread, 
sliced about 1/3-inch thick, makes this a perfect sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
CURRIED SHRIMP SALAD SANDWICH WITH APPLES AND CUCUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
1 medium pickling cucumber (about 3 1/2 ounces), peeled, seeded, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/2 medium tart apple (about 3 1/2 ounces), chopped 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons dried currants 
</P>
<P>
12 large peeled cooked shrimp (about 6 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
Light mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon honey 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons plain nonfat yogurt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
6 slices fresh sourdough bread 
</P>
<P>
Watercress leaves 
</P>
<P>
Combine cucumber, apple, currants, shrimp, 1/3 cup light mayonnaise, honey, 
yogurt, curry powder, salt and pepper flakes in small bowl. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Refrigerate several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, spread mayonnaise on bread slices. Divide shrimp mixture 
evenly between 3 slices, spreading to edge. Arrange watercress leaves over. 
Close sandwich with remaining bread slices. Use serrated knife to cut each in 
half. Makes 3 sandwiches.

COOK IT LIGHT: VICHYSSOISE: HOW TO CUT CALORIES, BOTHER

Vichyssoise is a rich, creamy potato soup that is always served cold. Like many 
famous French dishes, it actually started out as a way to use up leftovers -- 
in this case, leftover leek-and-potato soup. 
</P>
<P>
The soup was combined with heavy cream and served cold so that it became 
totally unrecognizable as a leftover. 
</P>
<P>
My lighter version of this classic is much easier to make than the original 
French technique. It also has a fraction of the calories and cholesterol per 
serving. 
</P>
<P>
For formal dinner parties I like to serve Vichyssoise in icers garnished with a 
dollop of caviar. For less formal buffet gatherings I sometimes serve the soup 
in mugs before seating my guests for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
VICHYSSOISE WITH CAVIAR 
</P>
<P>
2 medium baking potatoes (1 pound), peeled and diced 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chopped white onions 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups defatted chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup light sour cream 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt (omit if using salted stock) 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup minced onion 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup caviar 
</P>
<P>
Combine potatoes and onions in large saucepan. Add chicken stock and bring to 
boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until potatos are tender, about 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon cooked potato mixture into blender container or food processor. Add 
nonfat milk, sour cream, salt and lemon juice. Cover and chill well. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, pour 1/2 cup cold soup into each of 8 chilled bowls. Top each serving 
with 1 tablespoon minced onion and 1/2 tablespoon caviar. Makes 8 (1/2-cup) 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains approximately 80 calories; 54 mg cholesterol; 4 g fat; 
300 mg sodium.

FAST-FOOD OUTLETS TRY OIL CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: IN A NOD TO CONSUMER HEALTH CONCERNS, THE THREE LARGEST CHAINS 
SWITCH TO 100% VEGETABLE OIL TO REDUCE CHOLESTEROL CONTENT OF FRENCH FRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The French fries at McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's are having an oil 
change. Three of the nation's largest fast-food chains have announced that they 
will stop using beef-tallow and vegetable-oil blends and start using 100% 
vegetable oil to fry their potatoes. The switch reduces the saturated fat and 
gets rid of all the cholesterol in the fries. 
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating the beef fat eliminates one of the Achilles' heels of the 
fast-food industry," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group that has long criticized 
the nutritional content of fast-food menus. "It's a key change." 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of the use of beef fat marks a continuing trend by fast-food 
companies to offer healthier options -- and to compete on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
Practically all the chains now sell pre-packaged salads or offer salad bars; 
several feature grilled-chicken sandwiches, and a few are selling or 
test-marketing frozen yogurt. McDonald's is phasing in 1% low-fat milk and has 
introduced a nonfat apple bran muffin, Cheerios and Wheaties to its breakfast 
menu. It is also test-marketing carrot and celery sticks, reduced-oil 
condiments, pasta dishes and margarine instead of butter for spreading on 
pancakes and biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
While there are still healthy alternatives that fast-food restaurants haven't 
yet explored, Jacobson said, the past five years have been "punctuated with 
improvements." The "basic change is that companies now consider nutrition in 
their decision-making processes," he said. "They never used to." 
</P>
<P>
In its switch to healthier fries, McDonald's will be using a cottonseed and 
corn-oil blend, which will reduce the saturated fat by 45%. The new fries will 
be phased into all of McDonald's 8,300 domestic outlets by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's fries will be made with 100% corn oil; Burger King's version will use 
soybean and cottonseed oils. Both chains will offer the reformulated fries by 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Still, health and nutrition authorities warned that even with the oil changes, 
fast-food French fries are far from a health food. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a step in the right direction to switch from saturated fats to 
less-saturated ones," said Jayne Newmark, director of nutrition services at the 
Arizona Heart Institute. "However, I caution people when they're in a fast-food 
restaurant that just because a food is prepared with a less-saturated fat does 
not mean that it is low in fat and low in calories." 
</P>
<P>
For example, that large order of McDonald's fries still contains 400 calories 
and almost 22 grams of total fat. That's about a third of the total fat 
consumption recommended for an entire day. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Newmark added, "if someone wanted to have French fries 
occasionally, it would be a better choice now. It doesn't mean I would have 
them every single day. It just gives them a less-guilty option." 
</P>
<P>
John LaRosa, chairman of the task force on cholesterol issues for the American 
Heart Assn. and dean for clinical affairs at George Washington University 
Medical School, applauded the fast-food industry for "a very important step 
forward" but added a caveat. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if you sat down and looked at how much people eat out and what it 
(changing to 100% vegetable oil for frying French fries) means to total 
saturated-fat consumption, I don't think it would be that overwhelming." LaRosa 
pointed out that most of the saturated fat in the American diet comes from beef 
and dairy products, not French fries. 
</P>
<P>
The chains maintain that their decision to switch to all-vegetable oils was 
made in response to consumer demand, not after pressure from advocacy groups, 
including CSPI, or from Phil Sokolof, an Omaha businessman and anti-cholesterol 
crusader who in recent months has placed full-page ads in major newspapers 
criticizing the fat content of fast-food meals. 
</P>
<P>
While the three chains use 100% vegetable oil for frying chicken and fish, they 
said the delay in switching from beef fat in French fries was caused by 
difficulties in achieving a comparable taste. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants a golden-brown French fry, and they want it crispy and hot," 
said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International. Lynch said the challenge 
was to get a blend of vegetable oils that could produce the same 
characteristics as beef tallow, which absorbs well and adds flavor to fried 
potatoes. Nevertheless, when Wendy's first opened 21 years ago, it used 100% 
vegetable oil for its fries, Lynch said. In the mid-1970s, the company switched 
to an animal and vegetable fat blend because consumers preferred the taste. 
</P>
<P>
But Hardee's, which changed to a soybean-peanut oil blend for its French fries 
in 1988, said the other chains were just making excuses for the delay. "They 
will tell you it was taste. We will tell you it was cost," said Jerry Singer, 
spokesman for Hardee's. "Vegetable oils cost 30% more than beef-tallow blends. 
It's a multimillion-dollar decision."

MOVABLE FEASTS: TRATTORIA FARFALLA FINALLY REOPENS ITS DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time I went to fetch a meal from Trattoria Farfalla, we ended up 
eating El Pollo Loco. Farfalla was closed for remodeling and I hadn't called 
ahead. My friends, who'd been counting on grilled eggplant and focaccia, were 
great sports about eating coleslaw, tortillas and thighs. 
</P>
<P>
The next time, I called several hours in advance. "Could you call back a little 
later?" the voice on the line said. "You can phone 15 minutes before you want 
to pick up." 
</P>
<P>
"You're really open?" I said. We sounded like Nichols and May. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Trattoria Farfalla in Los Feliz is open again, larger, noisier, about a 
dollar more expensive per dish, and full of all things fluffy, crunchy, fresh 
and ripe. While Farfalla delivers, the pleasure of picking up your order 
consists of opening the door to one great garlic blast. 
</P>
<P>
"So you're coming with El Pollo Loco again, right?" my friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Ha. (Don't get me wrong: I like El Pollo Loco.) I arrived with a kind of 
hall-of-science museum display: bruschetta, focaccia rosmarino, pizza rustica 
and pizza pomodori secchi e pollo, all based on the same thin, crisp, blistered 
discs of dough. Five minutes away from the restaurant and all four dishes were 
cool. (I can tell you they were hot when I carried them into my car because I 
immediately ripped into the completely wonderful rosemary-and garlic-topped 
just-made focaccia.) 
</P>
<P>
 If the sign of a good pizza is that it can be eaten cold, then this place is 
on base. I like Farfalla's pizzas, even cold, a lot -- they get down to the 
bones of the dish. (Prices range from $7.50 for a 9-inch rustica to $13 for a 
15-inch one topped with sausage, rugola salad and Parmesan cheese.) The rustica 
comes elegantly coated with a thin glaze of good olive oil, perky fresh 
tomatoes, fresh basil and garlic, that's all. The sun-dried tomato and chicken 
version is also spare, with the sheerest slip of cheese and scarcely any 
poultry. The bruschetta differs from the Florentine version in which the 
tomatoes are cooked; Farfalla's arrives with the ripest, sweetest, raw tomatoes 
-- as good as the just-picked organic ones I find at my local farmer's market. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in the mood for the kind of great midnight snack you'd whip up 
yourself, try the farfalle alla vodka ($9.50), bow ties with rich, fragrant 
ham, gently smoked salmon and a light cream sauce. But only order this if 
you're in that refrigerator-raid sort of mood because this dish doesn't travel 
well. The Parmesan cheese absolutely congeals: You find yourself eating gluey 
texture along with the lovely taste. 
</P>
<P>
But besides the artichoke alla giudea -- which is not at all the traditional 
flattened, flash-fried version of the dish, but more a soggy stuffed crew cut 
of an artichoke -- and an overly salty pasta e fagioli, I look forward to 
eating nearly everything else again. 
</P>
<P>
An appetizer of wafer-thin eggplant, tasting, well, injected with garlic and 
balsamic vinegar, arrives with sweet silky peppers, delicate creamy goat cheese 
and vibrant green olives. It's $6.50 and would easily serve two. I am very 
cranky when it comes to the subject of seafood salad because it is one of my 
very favorite dishes: Farfalla's version gets an 8 out of 10. The portion is 
generous, the shrimp are as sweet as they get, the lemon-squirted olive oil is 
nice and the whole dish is worth $7.50. I subtract two points because the squid 
and octopus were rubbery. And why use that much celery? 
</P>
<P>
The Farfalla salad -- chopped romaine, radicchio and freshly grated Parmesan -- 
is served over a garlicky wad of the restaurant's hallmark pizza bread dough. 
It would make a good, light meal in itself. The plain mixed greens are fine 
too, but I think the dressings should be put on the side. You know how fast 
lettuce wilts. 
</P>
<P>
Lasagnette, slimmed-down lasagna noodles, is anything but skinny: this dish is 
decked out with ultra-creamy ricotta, fluffy pesto and a big fat handful of 
toasted pine nuts. Tagliolini ($9) is delicate with garlic, loaded with sweet 
butterflied shrimp and burnished with that good olive oil Farfalla consistently 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
There is a tiny selection of secondi. But the restaurant had run out of the 
veal dishes (two of the five entrees) when I called. No hardship: the halved 
roast chicken ($11) with its crusty coat of herbs, strong on the rosemary, is 
moist and delicious and comes with a sheaf of robust, garlicky vegetables. The 
peppery fennel sausage served with creamy polenta and a light pale orange 
tomato sauce ($9.50) is wonderful, too. 
</P>
<P>
The apple tart is densely dark with that full-bodied sweetness of just-made 
applesauce and the tirami su is not too sweet. You can't find them at El Pollo 
Loco. My friends had to rub it in. 
</P>

U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON ILLEGAL WINE IMPORTS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF 14 SMUGGLING AND LABEL FRAUD CASES HAS 
RESULTED IN MORE THAN $200,000 IN PENALTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government said last Thursday that fraud and smuggling of imported 
wine is on the rise and that it has successfully prosecuted 14 cases and has 70 
more cases under active investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our recent investigations have shown a definite increase in illegal activities 
in wine imports and we intend to take all steps possible under the law to stop 
it," said Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Moberly, chief of the special programs branch of the ATF, said ATF 
recently concluded 14 cases that resulted in more than $200,000 in penalties 
and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, ATF has 70 ongoing investigations of label fraud and 23 
more cases targeted for investigation. In those actions, some 17,000 cases of 
alcoholic beverages have been detained at ports of entry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moberly said most of the products discovered to be fraudulently shipped to the 
United States are small shipments "aimed at ethnic communities." 
</P>
<P>
She gave only one example of an "ethnic product" -- a Portuguese brandy that 
was labeled as wine to avoid paying a higher excise tax. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking more particularly at ethnic areas because there are certain 
products that people are accustomed to drinking that they may not be able to 
get domestically in the United States," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common practice is manipulating the label and submitting false 
documents to customs to avoid the proper tax classification." She said ATF, 
which has about 650 field inspectors, has found some products being smuggled 
into the country uncaught by customs inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
She said this is possible because "Customs officers are overwhelmed and they 
tell us they can only check something like 10% of the containers that come in. 
</P>
<P>
"So they'll open the door of a container and what they see is what they check 
against their manifest. If something (illegal) is buried in the middle of the 
container, chances are unlikely it will be caught." 
</P>
<P>
She said in one case, an ATF inspector "picked up a Portuguese product in our 
market basket sampling and saw there was a problem," and then tracked the item 
back to the importer. She said investigators recently have "picked up a steady 
stream of problems, and in some cases it isn't just mislabeling; in some cases 
it's outright fraud." 
</P>
<P>
She said some importers bring in products that ATF, the branch of the Treasury 
Department that regulates alcoholic beverages, has prohibited for various 
reasons. "Or they are simply lazy, and they stick on an old label that does not 
represent the product." 
</P>
<P>
In one case recently settled, she said, a company paid $130,000 in offers in 
compromise and criminal fines, plus tax penalties and interest, after pleading 
guilty to felony smuggling and label fraud. 
</P>

LATINO TO HEAD S.D. COLLEGE DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: IN A SURPRISE MOVE, TRUSTEES NAME AUGUSTINE GALLEGO TO REPLACE J. 
WILLIAM WENRICH, THE OUTGOING CHANCELLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Augustine Gallego, a 14-year veteran counselor and administrator in the San 
Diego Community College system, was named the district's new chancellor 
Wednesday night in a surprise move by trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego, 46, now district director of instructional and student services, will 
officially assume the top post Oct. 1 from J. William Wenrich, the 
well-respected chancellor who is leaving the district for a similar job in 
Dallas County, Tex. During his two-year tenure, Wenrich is credited by trustees 
with turning around faculty morale, refocusing academic programs and 
strengthening community ties after years of faculty-administration tensions. 
</P>
<P>
A surprised but pleased Gallego told reporters after his appointment that he 
hopes to build upon the many initiatives and programs begun by Wenrich. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego will become the first Latino to be chancellor, overseeing more than 
100,000 students and 4,100 faculty members at City, Mesa and Miramar colleges, 
as well as the Educational Cultural Complex in Southeast San Diego and nine 
other continuing education centers. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second-largest among California's 71 community college districts and 
plays an important role in providing vocational and part-time education to 
working students as well as preparing students academically for transfer to the 
UC and Cal State systems who are unable at first to meet four-year-college 
financial requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego listed his varied administrative preparation as a strength in carrying 
forward state-mandated plans for increasing the number of full-time faculty 
members in community colleges, improving ethnic diversity among professors and 
students and integrating vocational, academic and basic skills programs. 
</P>
<P>
"My appointment is also important not only symbolically but substantively as 
well," the Tucson native said. "I have worked well with numerous community 
groups and have an active profile that I hope to continue . . . with outreach 
to the community." 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, board president Dan Grady said that trustees 
decided to move quickly after Wenrich's resignation Aug. 2 so that momentum 
built up during Wenrich's tenure would not be lost during a year-long national 
search and appointment of an interim chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
"The hiatus under the direction of an interim chancellor was unacceptable," 
Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
"The board decided that it was most important to have in the position . . . a 
person who had long experience within the district and could advise the board 
based on personal knowledge and historical background." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five board members -- Grady, Louise Dyer and Charles Reid -- are 
retiring at the end of the year. But, although only two-year members Evonne 
Schulze and Fred Colby will continue as trustees, Grady and others said that 
Gallego will have the ability and personality to work well with any new board. 
</P>
<P>
"He can work with anybody," Colby said. "He's in the mold of Bill (Wenrich) but 
he has certain tools to even add things beyond those that Bill started, 
especially with the community. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no dissension among any of the trustees. Everyone felt he was the 
right person." 
</P>
<P>
Gallego received his bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona and his 
master's in educational psychology at UC Davis, where he also served as 
associate dean of student affairs for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego came to the San Diego district in 1976 to head the counseling program 
at the then-new Educational Cultural Complex. He later served as dean for 
continuing education programs, as provost at the ECC and as director of 
instructional and student services at City College before assuming the 
systemwide post under Wenrich.

4 SAILORS WHO QUESTIONED NIMITZ SAFETY TO BE REASSIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four sailors turned whistle-blowers aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz 
can no longer work aboard a nuclear vessel and face reassignment, as well as a 
salary cut, Navy officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But family members, awaiting the ship's arrival here Friday, countered that the 
Navy was making scapegoats of the men instead of adequately investigating their 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that has created a firestorm, the four sailors told a Seattle 
television station earlier this month that crew members aboard the Nimitz, 
based in Bremerton, Wash., had flouted safety regulations and the four 
threatened to sabotage the vessel's reactors to draw attention to their 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, Navy officials said that several sailors did cheat on 
exams covering their technical knowledge of the carrier's nuclear reactor 
procedures. But they quickly added that the cheating was not widespread and did 
not endanger the ship or its crew. 
</P>
<P>
"A handful of guys admitted they looked on their buddies' test paper during one 
exam," said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman. "But the reactors are 
operating safely, and the crew is well-qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Because the four sailors did not air their concerns and complaints to 
supervising officers, the Navy has lost confidence in the sailors and has 
chosen to revoke their credentials allowing them to work on a nuclear vessel, 
Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys in the nuclear propulsion program are held to a high standard; they 
are continually reminded to report any safety or security concerns to the chain 
of command," Pritchard said. "These guys did not. The commanding officer lost 
confidence in their ability to perform." 
</P>
<P>
With disguised voices and blocked out faces the sailors told television station 
KIRO that crew members were cheating on exams to compensate for their 
inadequate training; that faulty hardware had been installed aboard the vessel 
and that test results for radiation leaks were fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
After being informed by The Times that her son, Machinist Mate second-class 
Steven Puma had his credentials revoked Wednesday, his mother, Rima Puma, said 
she was very angry. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they doing this in order to cover up their own safety inadequacies? Are 
they saying my son is unreliable? Because they did something wrong, they are 
going to try and shove it off on my son," said Rima Puma, a Springfield, Ill., 
resident who traveled to San Diego in hopes of seeing her son. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Puma, who awaits her husband's arrival in San Diego, says her husband has 
received threats while aboard the Nimitz, which set sail for a training 
exercise Aug. 6, shortly after the four sailors' allegations surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy is trying to discourage anybody from coming forward with complaints," 
said Sara Puma, a chef in Port Orchard, Wash., who last spoke to her husband 
Sunday. "I told him that I loved him and . . . " Puma said, who broke into sobs 
and stopped talking. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy investigation, conducted by several naval agencies, has now been 
closed, Pritchard said. The names of the other sailors involved have not been 
released.

INVESTOR IN TROUBLED NATIONAL CITY HOTEL SEEKS CONTROL OF PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer and contractor working on a troubled National City hotel have 
been removed from the project by principal investor William Barkett, who told 
the City Council that disagreements and a large number of liens filed against 
the property are forcing him to take over the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
No work has been done on the Radisson Suites hotel -- save for the steel frame 
and shell -- for four months, as nervous city officials waited for Barkett, 
developer Jack Scull and contractor Christopher Boomis to pay the liens and 
resolve other differences that have arisen among the three. Scull is president 
of Serj Corp., and Boomis is president of Concrete Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
In telephone interviews Wednesday, Boomis and Scull confirmed that they are 
negotiating with Barkett to terminate their business relationship with him, but 
said they will continue on the project until an agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
However, it appears that Barkett, who controls the purse strings for the 
project, has won out. On Tuesday night, he told the City Council that Scull's 
Serj Corp. and Boomis' 
</P>
<P>
Concrete Dynamics are out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we still dealing with Serj Corp.?" asked Councilman Michael Dalla. 
</P>
<P>
His question prompted a terse "no" from Barkett. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having problems with the contractor," said Barkett, who added he is in 
the process of finding a new contractor for the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
However, a National City redevelopment agency official said Wednesday he is 
confused about Barkett's claim that Scull and Boomis are being replaced and 
noted that the city's contract for the project still belongs to Serj. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete Dynamics was hired by Serj to do the construction. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be remembered that Scull and Serj are the redevelopers," said Dave 
Shelton, assistant director of the city's redevelopment agency. "The master 
contract said Serj would do all four (street) corners. Serj is still the actor 
in that." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview Wednesday, Scull insisted that he is still the 
project's developer. 
</P>
<P>
"Serj is still the redeveloper for the four corners and has a contract with the 
city to accomplish the project. Serj is still involved to ensure the project is 
completed," said Scull. 
</P>
<P>
As to Barkett's claim that the city is no longer dealing with Serj, Scull said: 
</P>
<P>
"He's saying things that aren't quite correct." 
</P>
<P>
"It does appear that an agreement is in the works, and, if an agreement is 
signed, what he said is true," said Boomis. "We have agreed verbally to settle 
under certain terms and conditions. We don't want to do anymore business with 
Mr. Barkett." 
</P>
<P>
Barkett assured council members that the 12-story, $18-million Radisson Suites 
hotel, at the corner of 8th Street and National City Boulevard, will be 
completed on schedule next spring. 
</P>
<P>
A hotel across the street, the $12-million Radisson Inn -- 10 stories high with 
180 rooms -- was also built by Serj and Concrete Dynamics with investment money 
raised by Barkett. It opened last year. Both hotels are part of the city's Four 
Corners redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
The three businessmen declined to reveal details of the negotiations, but 
Barkett spokeswoman Susan Gossling told reporters Wednesday night that he is 
"now the owner, financier and builder" of the Radisson Suites. 
</P>
<P>
Gossling also confirmed persistent rumors that Kuwaiti money was used to build 
the Radisson Inn and Suites hotels. She declined to identify the Kuwaiti 
investors but said the crisis in the Middle East will not affect financing for 
the unfinished hotel. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gossling, Barkett's decision to sever his business relationship 
with Scull and Boomis was influenced in part by liens filed by unpaid 
subcontractors on the Radisson Inn and Suites projects. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the liens has been the subject of much controversy. 
</P>
<P>
National City Councilman Jess E. Van De Venter estimated the total at more than 
$4 million in June. Earlier, Scull told The Times that the "legitimate liens" 
that he recognized totaled about $200,000. Other estimates have put the total 
at between $1 million and $3 million. Boomis filed a lien of $1.25 million 
against Barkett. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Barkett said, some liens have been settled and agreements are 
being reached on others. He added that most subcontractors who filed liens 
against the hotels will be rehired. He estimated the current "amount of 
legitimate liens" at $300,000 to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett complained that the lien problem was made to appear worse because some 
contractors filed them twice, once on the Suites and again on the Inn. Gossling 
added that some contractors filed liens for the amount of the contract, which 
is much higher, rather than for the work they performed that went unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
"All this made the problem appear much worse than it was," said Gossling. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett assured council members that his dispute with Scull and Boomis will be 
settled within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Van De Venter informed Barkett of a new problem. He told him that 
the county has filed a delinquent property tax notice on one of the hotels for 
$22,000. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett, who was at a podium addressing the council, sighed and promised to 
take care of it.

VISTA COUNCIL VOTES AGAINST FIREHOUSE SALE; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SPLIT DECISION WILL PROBABLY STOP FAITH AND LOVE MINISTRIES FROM 
BUYING THE STATION FOR A HOMELESS SHELTER. A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE CONTROVERSY 
IS SET FOR TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Vista City Council has ordered its attorney to inform all parties in the 
controversial sale of a surplus fire station that the city, which owns 79% of 
the property, has not consented to the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action probably will kill the sale, according to the fire 
district that plans to sell the firehouse and the agency for the homeless that 
plans to buy it. Neighbors of the firehouse vehemently oppose plans to turn the 
firehouse into a shelter and job center for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Duane Fellows, board president of the Vista Fire Protection 
District, called a special meeting of the joint powers agency -- composed of 
the city and the fire district -- to thrash the matter out. 
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Vista Fire Department 
headquarters, 175 N. Melrose Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if, at that meeting, the city called for the title to 
Fire Station 2," said Fellows. He explained that the title is in the fire 
district's name because the property is outside the Vista city limits. "Vista 
is the lead agency in the joint powers authority and the city has the right to 
take over the title." 
</P>
<P>
The council's 3-1 action late Monday night followed a recommendation from City 
Atty. Ron Null to clarify the city's stand against the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The city opposes the sale because the fire district failed to follow city 
bidding procedures, Mayor Gloria McClellan said Wednesday. The district was in 
the process of selling the firehouse to Faith and Love Ministries, which 
planned to turn the 45-year-old building into a shelter for about 24 homeless 
men and women. 
</P>
<P>
That plan, which nearby neighbors and business owners have complained would 
bring crime to the South Santa Fe area and hurt property values, and the city's 
objections to it have led to threats of lawsuits by the ministries' officials, 
neighbors and those involved in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Jenene Nickerson, a ministries board member and an attorney, said Wednesday 
that the Vista council's stand against the sale probably would end it because 
no title company would close escrow on a sale to which the major property owner 
was opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Nickerson, who had written the city informing it that the charitable group's 
board position was that the fire station sale was a legal one, said that the 
matter "probably is going to end up in the courts with everyone suing 
everyone." The attorney said that she is not a trial lawyer and will not 
represent the ministries in any legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Sucro, founder and operator of Faith and Love Ministries, was not 
available for comment Wednesday, but said after the council's decision that the 
group would seek legal advice about filing suit against the city or the fire 
district if the sale is canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor McClellan said the city did not act to take over the title to the fire 
station, but that "that may be a future possibility." 
</P>
<P>
The fire district board awarded the bid to buy the firehouse to Faith and Love 
Ministries in June after the group's bid was determined to be the highest in 
which all bid requirements, including a 10% down payment, were met. 
</P>
<P>
Fellows said opposition surfaced immediately from residents and business owners 
around the fire station property. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been yelled at so much in my life," Fellows said. "I still say that 
we followed the rules, and we have an open escrow (with Faith and Love) that 
will have to be dealt with."

SUITS TARGET WOMEN-ONLY WEIGHT-LOSS SALONS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRIMINATION: THE MAN WHO MADE DISNEYLAND DROP ITS BAN ON SAME-SEX DANCING IS 
TRYING TO FORCE GLORIA MARSHALL TO OFFER ITS PROGRAMS TO MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Exler, the self-styled anti-discrimination crusader who forced 
Disneyland to drop its ban on same-sex dancing and won the right for men to 
attend Chippendale's male stripper shows, decided he would like to lose about 
40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
So he opened the newspaper to look for weight-loss program advertisements. 
Gloria Marshall Figure Salon's ad caught his eye: "Exclusive Program for Women 
Only," it said. Exler called some of the Orange County salons and a Torrance 
location listed in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you calling for your wife?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he replied. He wanted to become a member of the salon himself. 
</P>
<P>
Amused employees told him that was out of the question. Gloria Marshall's eight 
California salons serve women only. 
</P>
<P>
Now Exler, 29, has filed two lawsuits -- one in Orange County Superior Court 
and the other in Torrance Superior Court -- contending that the salon's policy 
violates the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination by businesses 
on the basis of sex, race or religion. 
</P>
<P>
Exler, a Palm Springs legal assistant, also is upset with the newspapers that 
have been running the advertisements, including The Times. He has filed a 
complaint with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which 
enforces anti-discrimination laws, contending that the ads are "aiding and 
abetting" Gloria Marshall in its discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Their women-only policy is just plain wrong," Exler said. "I have the right as 
a man, as a gay, as a Jew, to utilize every business establishment that's 
available in this state and I intend to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials, however, said their policy is not discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"We've designed a program specifically for the weight-loss needs and health 
needs of women," said Mark Bergendahl, company president and Gloria Marshall's 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"In 25 years, we have not had any experience with men, and I feel it would be 
imprudent of us to contend that we can handle a man's needs. . . . 
Physiologically, men and women have different makeups and we are simply 
specializing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergendahl said that the salons' operations are "a semi-locker-room situation 
in which there is some degree of undressing and things of that nature," and 
that the company does not allow men in the salons to protect the privacy of 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Although Exler's suits seeks $1 million each in damages, Exler said he would 
waive all monetary awards if the company agrees without a court battle to 
change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about money," he said. "This is about changing policies and 
enforcing equal rights." 
</P>
<P>
Exler said he has formally requested that The Times stop running Gloria 
Marshall advertisements stating the women-only policy. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Morgan, a spokeswoman for The Times, said officials are reviewing Exler's 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel at this time that since at this point . . . there has been no court 
order issued or determination made regarding Gloria Marshall's policy, that it 
would be unfair of us to stop running their ad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Exler, who filed the suit himself, is no stranger to such court actions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Exler sued Disneyland over its ban on same-sex dancing after security 
guards ordered him and another man to leave a park dance floor, stating that 
only heterosexual couples were allowed. Disneyland settled that suit in 1984 
and dropped the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Exler sued Chippendale's, which features all-male strip shows, 
when security guards refused to allow him and another man to enter.

CITIES OFFER MORE MILITARY HOUSING IN EFFORT TO KEEP BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the possible relocation of Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, 
at least two South Bay cities are taking steps to encourage the construction of 
affordable military housing in an effort to persuade the Defense Department not 
to move the space research and development facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials, who announced earlier this year that the base is one of 
five in the country that may be shut down or relocated to reduce defense 
spending, have identified the lack of affordable housing and land on which to 
expand as key issues in their pending decision. 
</P>
<P>
City officials across the South Bay are considering a wide range of options to 
address the issue, including using redevelopment funds to build new housing and 
allocating existing low-income housing units for military personnel. Some 
cities may try to bring down the cost of developing a military housing complex 
by adopting new zoning laws to allow more units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
"Any effort by the local communities to address these concerns is welcomed by 
the Air Force and will be taken into consideration when the decision is made as 
to the future of the base," Air Force spokesman Ed Parsons said Wednesday. 
Several studies of the possible closure are pending, but a decision is not 
expected until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The base, which includes housing facilities in San Pedro and the Air Force 
Space Systems Division headquarters in El Segundo, employs 3,200 people. The 
Aerospace Corp., a private, nonprofit research and development group that works 
closely with the adjacent Air Force division, employs 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force and city officials say thousands of other jobs and millions of 
dollars in revenues are directly or indirectly linked to the base and the 
related aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
While several South Bay cities in recent weeks have passed resolutions in 
support of retaining the Air Force base, Hawthorne went a step further this 
week, pledging to use "every available means to cause the construction of 
military family housing units" within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne officials are seriously considering channeling some redevelopment 
funds toward the construction of a multiunit military housing complex. Possible 
sites for the development include surplus school property and a large plant 
nursery that recently went on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth also sent a letter to the mayors of 18 cities 
last week urging them to adopt similar resolutions, saying a commitment by all 
South Bay cities "is the single most important action that needs to be done 
now."

The El Segundo City Council, which does not have a redevelopment agency, is 
expected to make a similar pledge next week and is considering creating an 
agency for the purpose of setting aside money to build affordable housing for 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is . . . we haven't had a chance to think through the viable 
options," El Segundo City Manager Ronald Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials recently surveyed local businesses, met with congressional 
leaders and made plans to send a delegation to Washington. "We're taking a very 
aggressive approach," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay cities were jolted into action last week after a draft of a local 
economic impact study predicted that closing the base could eventually mean the 
loss of 13,000 jobs and a $729-million reduction in regionwide spending by 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
Many local officials, however, say the economic impact on their communities of 
closing the base will probably be worse than the Air Force study indicates. 
Although about 80% of the Air Force employees live within 10 miles of the base, 
the study used figures from a 50-mile radius, thereby diluting the impact on 
South Bay cities, said Dominique Cau, executive vice president of the El 
Segundo Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel their estimates don't truly reflect the impact on El Segundo," Cau 
said. "We see a much more severe impact in loss of revenue and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber is compiling the results of a questionnaire it sent to 1,500 
businesses in the city, seeking predictions of how loss of the base would 
affect sales. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay Cities Assn. and the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce are 
collecting similar information from cities in the area for a report that they 
hope will be included in the final version of the Air Force economic study. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach Chamber of Commerce appears to be the only local business 
group that isn't participating in the survey. Chamber Vice President Russ 
Lesser said the group decided not to take a position on the future of the base 
because "we don't want to be self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
"We scream and yell as business people that government is inefficient and 
government has to clean up its act," Lesser said. "But isn't it hypocritical 
for us to say, 'Go ahead and do that, but don't cut our base?' We want the Air 
Force to make an objective decision and do what's in the best interest of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials are arguing, however, that it could cost the Air Force as much 
as $1 billion to relocate and that it would be much more efficient to allow the 
cities to come up with a solution to the housing problem. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials have been concerned about the lack of affordable housing in 
the South Bay for several years, although some of the pressure was relieved in 
1982 when they built and renovated 540 townhouses at Ft. MacArthur in San 
Pedro, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 170 single-family houses were built in Pacific Crest and Pacific 
Heights in San Pedro in 1988, but the Air Force still has an immediate need for 
250 affordable housing units for officers stationed at the base, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not asking (South Bay cities) to pay everything, but we obviously can't 
afford to build total housing right now at the present cost of housing in 
Southern California," Parsons said. "We're asking for assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said the request may not be 
practical for her city, which has some of the priciest real estate in the South 
Bay and whose redevelopment agency is mandated only to deal with landslide 
issues. But, she said, it is still in the city's interest to lobby the Air 
Force to keep the base in town. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay officials say the city of Hawthorne may be best equipped to deal with 
the problem quickly because it has an active redevelopment agency and several 
possible sites for a housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue said the Lawndale School District's Jonas 
Salk School, which was closed in 1972 because of a drop in enrollment, could be 
an ideal site for a military housing development. The five-acre site -- on 
which district officials would seek a long-term lease -- could accommodate 125 
housing units. By using redevelopment funds to help subsidize building costs, 
the city could help solve half of the Air Force's housing problem at an 
affordable price, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some developers have made inquiries about military housing, but nothing has 
come (about) because the Lawndale School District hasn't fully completed their 
study yet," Jue said. "We'll certainly pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
It could be years before new and affordable housing is available for Air Force 
personnel, but local officials are hoping that their resolve will be enough to 
fend off New Mexico and Colorado, states that are lobbying hard to land the Air 
Force base. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles), who along with 16 other members of 
Congress sent a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier this month 
opposing the relocation of the base, said in an interview Wednesday that the 
length of time it would take to build new housing matters less than the 
commitment to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what is key here is for cities to demonstrate the ability and 
willingness to do it," Levine said, "and if that is demonstrated, then the time 
frame shouldn't make a difference."

ICE RINK EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK: AFTER A CAMPAIGN BY SKATING ENTHUSIASTS, THE OWNERS OF THE PICKWICK 
ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT THEY WILL KEEP IT OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A well-organized campaign by skating enthusiasts has caused the owners of 
Burbank's Pickwick Ice Arena to reverse their decision to close the landmark 
facility that has served as a training ground for several Olympic champions, 
sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Walter and Edward Stavert are expected to announce at a news conference 
this morning that the 29-year-old rink will not close Sept. 30 as planned. The 
Staverts announced in June that they were closing the arena, which is one of 
the few Olympic-size rinks in Los Angeles, because operating costs were 
prohibitive. Pickwick General Manager Frank Silvio has said the arena needs 
about $500,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement, skating enthusiasts have rallied to save the rink, home 
of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club. The club is one of the most competitive 
in the nation and has nurtured such Olympic skating stars as Linda Fratianne, 
Tiffany Chin and Christopher Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a popular practice arena for many local hockey clubs. Olympic figure 
skaters who referred to the facility as their second home joined the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pickwick management has remained silent on the closure, regular 
patrons of the rink said they have seen evidence that it will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
John Halebian, chairman of the hastily organized Save the Ice Committee, said 
signs announcing the rink's closure are no longer posted at the arena. George 
Yates, secretary of the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Assn., said he was told 
privately by rink management that the association should plan its 1990-91 
season "under the assumption that the rink will remain open." And Nick 
Nickerson, a 72-year-old hockey player, said Walter Stavert told him outright 
that Pickwick will not be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Rink Manager Cary Adams would not confirm directly that the rink will remain 
open, but said the owners were strongly influenced by public reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a classic example of people making a difference," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The Staverts began reconsidering their decision in July. Silvio said a 
contractor was brought in to inspect the arena's leaking roof and discussions 
began with Burbank officials about city involvement in keeping the rink open. 
</P>
<P>
Although they voiced their support for the rink, Burbank city officials were 
unwilling to spend money to prevent the closure. Supervisor Mike Antonovich had 
wanted the rink to be included in the county's massive parks bond measure, 
scheduled to appear on the November ballot. He later dropped the idea, but 
retained the option of devoting funds not committed to any other project to the 
arena if the measure is approved by voters.

COUNCIL VOTES TO PERMIT HOUSING ON OLD HOTEL SITE; 
</P>
<P>
HERMOSA BEACH: THE CITY COUNCIL HAS VOTED 3 TO 2 TO ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF AS 
MANY AS 16 CONDOMINIUMS ON A CONTROVERSIAL BEACHFRONT PARCEL. BUT THAT VOTE HAS 
TO BE CONFIRMED, AND THE OPPOSITION PERSISTS. 
</P>

<P>
Efforts to settle Hermosa Beach's long-running debate on the future of the old 
Biltmore Hotel site took a small step forward Tuesday when the City Council 
narrowly voted to permit residential housing on the beachfront lot. 
</P>
<P>
By its 3-2 vote -- which must be confirmed in a final action later this month 
-- the council hopes to end a controversy that has dogged the city ever since 
the old hotel was torn down in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
However, not many people expect the festering issue to disappear so easily. 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Parker Herriott, who has long championed development of a 
park in the now-vacant and weedy lot of almost an acre, promised Tuesday to 
initiate a recall drive against council members supporting the housing 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Herriott said he would work to place the issue on the ballot again, despite 
numerous and inconclusive attempts in the past to have voters decide the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"It now appears that the council wants to act without the opinion of the 
people. . . . This smacks of a dictatorship," Herriott told the council, 
holding a hand-drawn poster colored with his vision of an oceanfront park 
between 14th and 15th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Essertier argued that the city could buy less expensive open 
areas to convert into public parkland with proceeds gained by selling the 
city-owned Biltmore parcel, valued at $8 million for residential development. 
"We would have more green, more park, by selling that lot," Essertier said. 
</P>
<P>
This week's vote was a replay of an initial vote taken last month, with 
Essertier, Mayor Roger Creighton and Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke supporting 
the current proposal. The matter was returned for a public hearing this week 
because Essertier privately discussed alternative proposals with other council 
members, raising concern that the state law on open meetings had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the same plan as last time -- a zoning change that would 
allow construction of as many as 16 condominiums on the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Chuck Sheldon voted against the proposal, saying he supported a 
mixed-use development in which the front part of the site would be made into a 
park and the back lots developed commercially, preferably for a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Albert Wiemans also voted in the minority, saying he wanted to send 
the issue to the people for a vote. Creighton predicted it would end up back on 
the ballot in any case. 
</P>
<P>
But as most council members noted, the public has never spoken with one voice 
about what to do with the property and isn't doing so now. Just last November, 
two competing ballot measures regarding the Biltmore site both failed to garner 
the necessary votes. One would have split the site into park, commercial and 
housing areas. The other, drafted by Herriott, would have converted all of the 
site into a park. 
</P>
<P>
At this week's public hearing, residents suggested everything from hotels to 
senior citizen housing for the little strip that fronts The Strand. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough open space near the beach," said one resident, Jerry Compton, 
who argued against the park idea. "We have the whole beach." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Richard Parker of St. Cross Episcopal Church said a park "would be 
ideal for the older people to enjoy the beach and sunset." Parker said seniors 
such as himself have no place to sit near the beach and often hesitate to cross 
The Strand, where bicyclists, roller-skaters and runners speed along the path. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the residents who turned out to express their opinions supported 
the city's plan to sell the property and use the revenue to buy other land, 
diminish city debt and lower taxes. One resident, citing Santa Monica as an 
example, warned that a park could invite vagrants and homeless people to loiter 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the city decides, though, the plan must also clear the Coastal 
Commission. Some residents said the commission might reject a zone change that 
switches the site's use from one serving the public and beach visitors to one 
benefiting private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the sandy stretch of prime real estate remains as it was 25 
years ago, vacant and dotted with litter, animal waste and tufts of grass.

GREYSTONE'S FUTURE STILL CLOUDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Another study. Another debate. Another date for Greystone. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of struggling over what to do with one of the most lavish 
estates ever built in California, Beverly Hills this week began to review a 
course outlined in a new study that suggests splitting the colossal mansion 
into a multiple-use facility. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than generate new enthusiasm for Greystone's future, the report 
served to conjure up the ghosts that have shadowed its past. Local 
preservationists and nearby residents criticized the study, saying that the 
recommended uses would generate too much traffic, not enough money and few 
cultural benefits. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to a presentation Tuesday night of the initial phase of the 
$40,000 study by consultant Pannell Kerr Forster, which recommends a 
combination corporate conference center and banquet-wedding facility at the 
famed Tudor mansion, Greystone Foundation officials again suggested that the 
city turn it into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
But for each idea, there was at least one countering view. 
</P>
<P>
"In my estimation, the majority of the residents of Trousdale Estates don't 
favor a museum," said Alan E. Berlin, president of the 535-member Trousdale 
Homeowners Assn., the group that represents the neighborhood around Greystone. 
"But I'm not sure that they would favor a corporate center there either." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin suggested selling the property to a private developer, who could either 
renovate the mansion or subdivide the property. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 90 minutes of debate, the council said it would consider moving 
on to the next phase of the study at its Sept. 4 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid a single-purpose use has passed us up," Vice Mayor Vicki Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city bought Greystone in 1965 with the intention of preserving it. But for 
the last 10 years, the sprawling mansion has sat empty while the city has 
struggled to find the best, yet least intrusive, use for it. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1928 at the then-staggering cost of $3 million, Greystone was 
built for Edward Laurence (Ned) Doheny, son of the first man to strike it rich 
in Los Angeles oil. The 55-room, 46,000-square-foot mansion was built of 
3-foot-thick concrete walls, covered in stone and roofed with imported Welsh 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
But while everyone attests to its magnificence, few can agree on what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations to lease it for use as a Westside branch of the County Museum of 
Natural History collapsed last year after the city decided it would have to 
give up too much control over Greystone. Beverly Hills officials say that 
museum curators want at least a 35-year lease for the property and to expand 
its activities, while the city wants to reduce the effect on nearby residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new consultant says the city can meet all of its cultural, 
historical and economic objectives by transforming Greystone into a corporate 
meeting center and special-events hall for private parties. 
</P>
<P>
According to Steven Hudson, an official with Pannell Kerr Forster, the 
multiple-use designation would raise enough money to pay for Greystone's 
renovation costs and not bother residents in the neighboring estates. Hudson 
said several city hotels have expressed interest in using the facility as an 
executive conference center.

SAN DIGEO COUNTY DIGEST: JULIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tap water in Julian is again safe to drink, officials from the county 
Department of Health Services said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene, a cancer-causing component of gasoline, was detected in the mountain 
community's water system Friday, and residents were warned not to drink the 
water, said Harry Seifert, general manager of the Julian Community Services 
District, which distributes the water to 500 residents. 
</P>
<P>
A malfunction in the town's carbon filtration system allowed the benzene to 
contaminate the water, Seifert said. Although the filter was repaired Saturday, 
water in the distribution pipes was still tainted earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted Wednesday found no evidence of the chemical, health officials 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the efforts of more than 50 firefighters, a historic fruit-packing 
plant in Fallbrook was gutted early Wednesday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old, 154,000-square-foot Lemon Twist plant, originally known as the 
Fallbrook Citrus Plant, was destroyed, said North County Fire Protection 
District dispatcher Greg Holdridge. Citrus fruits were still being packed at 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter suffered a broken ankle while fighting the blaze, which 
apparently began about 1:30 a.m. No other injuries were reported, Holdridge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the building, in the 200 block of West College Street, was estimated 
at $1.5 million, Holdridge said.

AFIELD BY JERRY SCHAD: MOUNTAIN HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
PALOMAR STILL A SCENIC WONDER DESPITE FIRES, YEARS OF DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Schad 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no doubt the rolling high country of Palomar Mountain embodies North 
County's most picture-perfect mountain scenery. It's just a shame we can't have 
a little more of it. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a sea of chaparral and sage scrub, Palomar's magnificent groves 
of oak, pine, fir and cedar are a testament to its ability to snag from passing 
storm clouds a fairly respectable 40 inches or so of precipitation annually. 
(This figure, of course, is a long-term average -- lately it has been closer to 
half that.) 
</P>
<P>
Palomar has been under attack on a number of fronts during the past few years. 
A 13,100-acre wildfire burned off much of the south face in 1987, and another 
fire on the north slope just last year charged through 15,600 acres of 
century-old chaparral and timber. Some of the meager rainfall has come in the 
form of gully-washing cloudbursts. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the current drought, four years and counting, has singled out 
some of the weaker trees, leaving them susceptible to fatal parasitism by bark 
beetles and mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the gem of Palomar -- Palomar Mountain State Park -- has 
managed to remain attractive, if a bit singed here and there by fire and 
drought. Your kids can still fish for trout in Doane Pond, rivulets of water 
can be seen in some of the ravines, and the wooded areas -- probably the most 
varied and interesting in the county -- are inspiring to behold. 
</P>
<P>
The state park's mile-high altitude offers some relief from dog-day 
temperatures. If you go hiking here in August or September, you'll want to 
stick to the shady trails, and probably short ones at that. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a couple of the better routes: 
</P>
<P>
For both hikes, park at Doane Pond, 2 miles past the park's entrance station 
(day-use fee is charged). 
</P>
<P>
For the Upper Doane Valley loop, walk to the far side of the lake and continue 
on Thunder Spring Trail. The trail stays on the west side of alder-fringed 
Doane Creek, luminescent in the morning or midday sunshine, deeply shaded by 
late afternoon. You'll thread your way past dark-trunked black oaks, canyon 
live oaks and lofty conifers such as incense cedars and big cone Douglas firs. 
A side path on the right leads to seeping Thunder Spring, framed by the 
drooping fronds of giant chain fern. 
</P>
<P>
After about a mile you'll come upon a wider trail at the head of the valley -- 
Upper Doane Trail. If it's a hot day you'll probably want to return to Doane 
Pond the same way. If not, then turn left and return back down the valley by 
way of the sunny meadow. Near the end you'll pass San Diego city and county's 
Palomar school camp, where students have a chance to experience a week of 
adventure and learning as part of their education. 
</P>
<P>
Lower Doane Valley, in my opinion, shows off the very best of the Palomar 
forest. From the corner of the Doane Pond parking lot, take the Doane Valley 
Nature Trail (self-guiding brochures for this trail are available at the 
trailhead or the park's entrance station.) You descend along lower Doane Creek, 
where box elder, dogwoods, wild strawberry vines, currant bushes, and a host of 
other water-loving plants make a rather uncommon appearance in our arid county. 
The grizzled, redwood look-alike ahead is an incense cedar, a survivor of past 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
When you come to a trail fork after 1/3 miles, you can go right, completing the 
Doane Valley Nature Trail loop, or left toward the point where Doane and French 
creeks join to form the headwaters of Pauma Creek. At the trail's end you find 
an old weir and gauging station, built in the late 1920s to test the 
hydroelectric potential of the stream. The tests proved negative, but it is 
hoped that there will be enough water there for you to soak your feet in. 
</P>
<P>
Other facilities at Palomar Mountain State Park include campsites, picnic areas 
and plenty more hiking trails. Campsites should be reserved well in advance. 
For more information, you can call the state park office at 742-3462.

People keep saying that the world is becoming a smaller place. Maybe it is. 
</P>
<P>
At World of Maps, 607 Mission Ave. in Oceanside, Bill Coates has a globe in 
stock that's less than an inch in diameter. It's attached to a key ring. He 
also carries a 9-by-12-foot wall map of the world. In between, Coates carries 
maps of nearly every country, as well as the moon, the Milky Way and the known 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes your family kind of flinch when you say you're going into the map 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Coates seems to have found a niche. He says he has drawn customers from all 
over Orange and San Diego counties since he opened for business in January, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I get all different people from all walks of life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For many who visit the store, maps are the tools of their trade. Developers, 
hikers, geologists, business planners, travel agents and educators are some of 
his customers. But there are many who don't have a specific need -- they just 
like to come in and browse. 
</P>
<P>
Shelves are filled with folded maps of states, provinces and regions the world 
over. Above those, the walls are lined to the ceiling with unfurled maps. Along 
the back wall is a collection of globes. 
</P>
<P>
There are specialty maps, such as one showing the beers of Europe, a cheese map 
of France and a large map that charts the history of Europe. There are nautical 
and aeronautical maps, topographical maps, maps that show fault lines, raised 
relief maps and maps that show ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
Some are not really maps but photographs, such as the astronaut's view of Earth 
-- a full-color mug shot of the planet. There are also high-resolution pictures 
of San Diego and Los Angeles from space. There are globes with light bulbs 
inside, and a clear plastic celestial globe with constellations on the outside 
and Earth at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the cash register hangs a stick chart, a crude but apparently accurate 
representation of the Marshall Islands that was fashioned out of bamboo sticks 
and pearlized shells by island inhabitants, Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
World of Maps also has travel books, foreign language tapes and travel 
accessories, such as universal power adapters and zippered belts for hiding 
money. But the focus is on maps, Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers often look around a while before they casually confide in him that 
they have always liked maps, he said. For these quiet map lovers, the shop 
opens a door to wanderlust. 
</P>
<P>
It's a place where visitors can feel at home, no matter where they are from. 
They can see where they've been and where they intend to go. If anyone is 
unsure of exactly where Kuala Lumpur is, or has been wondering lately about 
Mozambique, or is simply curious about what time it is in Reykjavik, he or she 
can find out at World of Maps. 
</P>
<P>
The store seems especially exciting to young children. They feel compelled to 
run and holler as soon as they see all the maps. Coates isn't sure why. He 
can't even put a finger on why he likes maps so much. It could be the order 
imposed by the twisting lines and jigsaw of colors, and all the mind-boggling 
places and prospects that can transform a piece of paper into a kind of magic 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"I can look at a map and take a trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coates was 10 when he discovered his natural inclination for latitude and 
longitude. Maybe he also saw in maps the power to lay waste to the fallacy of 
"you can't get there from here." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I was going to be a pilot someday, so I hung around the airport 
and started reading aeronautical maps," he said. He was surprised to learn that 
not everyone could appreciate the ideal world he found in maps. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom never knew how to read a map, and that just amazed me," Coates said. 
"She'd look at a map and not know if it was upside down or right side up." 
</P>
<P>
Coates, now 56, did become a pilot and flew all over the world for the Air 
Force for 13 years. He now has a small plane of his own, and ready access to 
aeronautical maps when he needs them. 
</P>
<P>
He closes the shop for one week each year, when he and his wife, Pam, who keeps 
the books, go on vacation. During the rest of the year, he sees plenty of 
globe-trotters. 
</P>
<P>
"People come in here, and they're getting ready to go on some great trips," 
Coates said. "It makes you want to get your hat and go with them."

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CAUGHT IN COMMON DENOMINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Innocents turned loose in Continental restaurants have been known to blithely 
order steak tartare and then, when served, to exclaim to the waiter "But I 
didn't order it raw!" 
</P>
<P>
There's a Japanese eatery named Katsu in Old California Restaurant Row, the 
sizable restaurant village in San Marcos, that evidently takes a wary view of 
plying its customers with too much raw fish. The separate sushi menu blares the 
fact that 70% of the sushi is garnished with cooked items and makes the 
practice seem both a virtue and an accommodation of timid tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Most Californians are sufficiently versed in the ways of Japanese cuisine to 
know that sushi does not, in any case, specifically denote raw fish; these 
little bundles of sweetened rice can be garnished with any sort of tidbit, 
including, but not limited to, raw or cooked seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Katsu's "you can play it safe" approach takes the challenge out of ordering 
sushi, although the list is amazingly comprehensive and runs from all the 
usuals to things like tuna and octopus marinated in chili sauce; a Philadelphia 
sushi of lox and cream cheese; a tempura roll that combines a variety of 
seafoods with omelet and avocado, and a seaweed cone rolled around a filling of 
halibut, smelt roe, asparagus and white sauce. All cooked varieties can be 
rolled inside a fried crepe for an additional 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the selection is grand, the preparation is heavy-handed; the 
sushi bar seems more interested in impressing diners with size than delicacy. 
Simple tuna rolls were too large to be eaten at a single bite, and sushi filled 
with salted cucumber had been so loosely packed that it fell apart on the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner menu runs to less length but is no less aggressive in its efforts to 
please every taste and create a sort of common denominator variant on 
traditional Japanese cuisine. The entree list even includes fish blackened in 
the so-called Cajun style and sauteed squid steaks in a wine-butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Boat-shaped wooden platters, served for two or more and described with such 
names as Love Boat and Fantasy Boat, are stuffed from prow to stern with vast 
collections of such items as steak and chicken teriyaki, sashimi and tempura. 
They make a good choice for the truly ravenous and seem, because of the sheer 
quantity they contain, bargain priced. 
</P>
<P>
Diners who opt to jump ship and order from the simpler side of the menu have 
the option of any of 12 combination plates, all of which include either 
vegetarian tempura or one that includes a few shrimp in the mix. The tempura 
lacked flavor -- both the batter and the soy-based dipping sauce seemed 
tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
Indelicacy -- the opposite of what one would expect at a Japanese restaurant -- 
seemed the general rule for the entrees. 
</P>
<P>
A serving of salmon teriyaki was both dry and hard. A New York sirloin teriyaki 
came off better, although the kitchen would have done well to trim it of fat, 
an operation most difficult to achieve at table when using chopsticks. The beef 
in a serving of sukiyaki was thickly sliced, tough, dry and similarly edged in 
fat. The best things about the dish were the tender, transparent noodles and 
the sweet broth. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant takes the style of a Japanese country inn and depends for this 
motif upon a heavy, beamed wooden ceiling from which hang immense paper 
lanterns. Despite the cavernous qualities of the dining room, the noise level 
is within the comfort range, as is the informal mood.

IRAQ BIDS FOR PEACE WITH IRAN; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: HUSSEIN'S SURPRISE MOVE WOULD FREE HIS TROOPS TO FULLY CONFRONT 
MULTINATIONAL FORCES. PLAN ACCEPTS ALL OF TEHRAN'S TERMS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bold diplomatic move, President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday offered peace 
to Iran -- on all of Iran's terms -- to free his troops for the confrontation 
with multinational forces along the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The embattled Hussein, foreseeing a "great duel" touched off by his invasion of 
Kuwait, declared that his troops will withdraw from occupied Iranian territory 
beginning Friday and that he will begin releasing Iranian prisoners of war the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Iraq agreed to Iranian terms for control of the vital Shatt al 
Arab, the waterway that defines the two nations' southern frontier. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise maneuver was immediately welcomed by Iran, which had denounced 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and blamed Baghdad for opening the door to Western 
intervention in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"Praise to God," Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati declared on Tehran 
Radio after hearing the news. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Morteza 
Sarmadi, said in a Tehran Radio broadcast that Hussein's offer would lead to a 
"lasting and just peace" after the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, which left hundreds 
of thousands dead on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
But Iran's official news agency said that no official position would be taken 
until the proposal can be carefully studied. Hard-line Iranians were strongly 
opposed to the 1988 truce that ended the war -- Iran and Iraq have yet to sign 
a formal peace treaty -- and sharp debate among Iranian politicians is likely 
on any important proposal from Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said an Iraqi delegation was arriving in Tehran on Wednesday 
night to present the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's offer of peace was set out in a letter to Iranian President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, whom he addressed as "Dear Brother." The letter was quoted as 
saying that "serious interaction" is needed "to confront the evil-doers who 
want harm to befall the Muslims and the Arab nation." 
</P>
<P>
The letter's wording made it plain that Iraq wishes to relieve pressure on its 
eastern flank. Hussein offered peace "in order not to keep any of Iraq's 
potential out of action outside the arena of the great duel." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we could cooperate," he said, "in preserving the gulf as a lake of 
peace and stability free from foreign cliques and powers lurking there." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden move indicated growing pressure on the Iraqi strongman, hemmed in by 
mounting Western military forces and his inability to obtain Arab acquiescence 
to his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
As Hussein made the offer, U.S. forces continued to dig in at undisclosed 
locations in Saudi Arabia after being sent there to help ease the Saudi 
monarchy's fears of an invasion from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, just to the north. 
And the many nations taking part in the U.N.-ordered economic sanctions against 
Iraq continued to tighten the screws. Iraq's oil exports have been virtually 
shut off, and much of its imports have been curbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam has got himself into a situation where fences have closed around him," 
said Don Kerr, an analyst with London's International Institute for Strategic 
Studies. "I'd say he was taken aback by the United Nations sanctions and the 
speed of the American deployments. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sitting in essentially a landlocked country, with no friend in Syria on 
his western border, the Soviets disapproving of the invasion, and Iran, an old 
enemy, in the east. He has to mend fences." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein might be hoping that peace with Iran will give him access to trade 
routes blocked by Western enforcement of the U.N. sanctions. Iran controls one 
side of the gulf and could present difficult political problems for the Western 
powers if it opened its ports to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But peace with Iran, perhaps supplemented by a nonaggression pact, would not 
assure Hussein of Iranian approval of the Kuwaiti invasion. Immediately after 
Hussein's tanks rolled southward, Tehran moved to assure Syria and Arab oil 
states of its opposition to the blitzkrieg invasion, sending Foreign Minister 
Velayati on a whirlwind tour of regional capitals. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater termed the Iraqi 
offer a "diversion" intended to distract attention from Iraq's occupation of 
Kuwait. The overture "doesn't deal with Kuwait," he said. "It doesn't deal with 
the invasion. It doesn't deal with any of the objectives that we have." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler expressed similar skepticism 
about the Iraqi offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's wait and see if this is followed through on," she said. "Our experience 
over the last 13 days has been that their statements, both publicly and 
privately, do not always follow through." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Tutwiler said, "if Saddam means to divert world attention from his 
aggression, it will not work. The world, including Iran, remains united in 
opposition to his invasion and occupation of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Bush Administration officials said the Iraqi strongman's willingness 
to give up so much to his regime's oldest enemy seemed to indicate that the 
U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia and the international sanctions against 
Iraq have begun to bite. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's proposal came on a day when the economic sanctions were being further 
tightened. An official at the southern Turkish port of Mersin said two ships 
carrying meat for Iraq were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the arrival of the first Syrian troops for the multinational force 
assembling in Saudi Arabia was delayed by logistical problems. Additional 
Egyptian forces faced the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem of absorption," an Egyptian military officer said in Cairo, 
explaining the difficulties encountered in rushing troops to Saudi Arabia. He 
said the delay was expected to last 24 to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's eagerness to make peace with Iran has been evident since April, when 
Hussein sent out feelers that led to subsequent talks between the Iraqi and 
Iranian foreign ministers. The Kuwaiti invasion appeared to torpedo that 
initiative, but despite the long war, Arab Iraq and non-Arab Iran have common 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, they are partners in oil strategy in the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Both support high prices that in the first half 
of this year were subverted by overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they are rivals in their ambition to control events in the gulf 
region and have stretched their influence to Saudi Arabia and the oil sheikdoms 
on the Arab shore. As recently as Sunday, Rafsanjani said Iranian forces were 
capable of policing the strategic waters. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry for power has made them enemies. In 1975, the late Shah Mohammed 
Reza Pahlavi, who ruled Iran and policed the gulf with American backing, struck 
a deal at an Algiers conference that gave Tehran sovereignty over the eastern 
half of the Shatt al Arab, which is formed by the confluence of the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers and which links Iraq's main port of Basra to the gulf. Iran 
has an enormous shoreline on the east side of the Persian Gulf, but Iraq, all 
but landlocked, has depended heavily on the Shatt al Arab for access to the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In September of 1980, the year after the Iranian revolution deposed the shah 
and installed a Muslim fundamentalist, clergy-led government, Hussein ordered 
his army across the Shatt and into Iran's Arab-populated southwestern 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion began a grueling eight-year war with an estimated combined 
casualty toll of 1 million. In August, 1988, his army spent, the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, accepted a U.N.-brokered truce, 
although he termed it "worse than poison." 
</P>
<P>
Since then the frontier has been patrolled by U.N. observers and marked by 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers have held on to 1,000 square miles of Iranian territory near the 
border's midpoint. This territory was seized in the final stage of the conflict 
with the support of paramilitary troops of the Moujahedeen, the main Iranian 
exile force. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's peace offer, Hussein said the Iraqi occupying forces would be 
removed beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We will pull back our forces facing you along the border," he told Rafsanjani, 
"keeping a symbolic force together with border guards and police merely to 
undertake daily duties in normal circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's letter said he was accepting an earlier Iranian proposal for an 
exchange of prisoners of war. This is a highly emotional issue in Iran and has 
frustrated U.N.-mediated contacts between the two countries. U.N. officials 
estimate that Iraq holds about 30,000 Iranian POWs and that Iran has about 
60,000 Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of control of the Shatt al Arab, Hussein pledged to adopt the 
1975 Algiers agreement, which would divide the waterway down the middle. The 
division of the waterway was considered a principal cause of Hussein's 1980 
invasion, underlining his demand for total control of the passage. 
</P>
<P>
The waterway was a questionable prize. By late in the war, it had become so 
filled with damaged and sunken ships that it was impassable. Some of the 
heaviest fighting of the war took place in the area, around the Iranian cities 
of Abadan and Khorramshahr and the Iraqi port of Basra. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian demands for a return to the Algiers formula became another sticking 
point in tentative peace suggestions, with Iraq refusing until Wednesday to 
consider the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
With Basra blocked, Iraq developed Umm Qasr to the west as a port to ship its 
oil out of the gulf, but two Kuwaiti islands -- Bubiyan and Warba -- shielded 
the access, and both Iraq and Iran pressured the Kuwaitis during the war for 
military use of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad kept up the pressure after the truce, and since its invasion of Kuwait 
it now controls the islands, as well as the Kuwaiti oil ports.

HUSSEIN'S PEACE OVERTURE 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday accepted virtually all Iranian 
conditions for a comprehensive peace treaty following the two nations' 
1980-1988 war. Here are the four major concessions Hussein made in a letter to 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani: 
</P>
<P>
BORDERS: Hussein agreed to accept the 1975 Algiers Treaty, which divided Iran 
and Iraq down the main channel of the Shatt al Arab waterway. He had previously 
demanded full sovereignty of the waterway, which is Iraq's key outlet to the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
WITHDRAWAL: Iraqi troops will pull out from Iranian territories seized in the 
war. The withdrawal will begin Friday, Hussein promised. 
</P>
<P>
PRISONERS: Iranian prisoners of war will be freed, also beginning Friday, 
Hussein said. The Red Cross has registered about 17,000 Iranian POWs and about 
50,000 Iraqi POWs. But U.N. and other officials have estimated the total number 
at 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
TALKS: Hussein sent an official delegation to Tehran, to work out details of 
the agreements and prepare a peace treaty for signing.

BUSH DEFENDS POLICY, REJECTS IRAQI CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
HOME FRONT: DEFENSE OFFICIALS TELL HIM THE BUILDUP IN ARABIA COULD COST AN 
EXTRA $1.5 BILLION OVER 2 MONTHS.

<P>
President Bush defended his Persian Gulf policy Wednesday, rejecting 
accusations by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the United States has 
created a "struggle between Arabs and Americans" and charges by critics at home 
that he has risked lives solely over the price of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke at the Pentagon after a briefing from top defense officials, who 
told him that the huge U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia and the 
surrounding waters could cost an extra $1.5 billion over the next 60 days, even 
if no shots are fired, or about 3% more than the Defense Department was 
planning to spend before the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the President left Washington to return to Kennebunkport, Me., where 
he plans to meet today with Jordan's King Hussein, who may be carrying a 
message from Iraq's leader. Bush also plans to meet with Saudi Arabia's foreign 
minister, Saud al Faisal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides have sought to lower expectations surrounding King Hussein's 
trip, suggesting that it is merely a chance for the two men to talk, rather 
than the prelude to a possible breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
As the crisis approaches the two-week point, Administration officials seemed 
generally pleased with how the U.S.-led effort against Iraq has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's unexpected proposal to surrender to Iran all the fruits of the 
eight-year war between the two countries, officials said, seemed to be a sign 
that the Iraqi leader is feeling the pinch of the U.S. military buildup and 
international economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The buildup escalated Wednesday as the Pentagon announced that the Air Force's 
high-tech F-117 Stealth fighter would be sent to the Middle East. The 
government did not say how many of the planes would be deployed or where they 
would be based. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall optimism, officials conceded that time and stalemate could 
erode the U.S. position both in the Middle East, where President Hussein has 
tried to position himself as a defender of Arab nationalism against Western 
interlopers, and at home, where American patience for foreign military ventures 
has often been short. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's harshly worded speech, laced with references to "atrocities" and "sordid 
brutality," seemed designed to stave off both of those potential threats and to 
focus blame for the standoff in the Persian Gulf on "that one man, Saddam 
Hussein," rather than on Iraq as a nation. In so doing, Bush tried to advance 
the Administration's publicly unstated goal of using the crisis to push the 
Iraqi leader out of power. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam has claimed that this is a holy war of Arab against infidel," Bush 
said, following the widespread practice of referring to the Iraqi strongman by 
his first name. "This from the man who has used poison gas against the men and 
women and children of his own country" and who started a war against Iran "that 
cost the lives of more than half a million Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
"It is Saddam who lied to his Arab neighbors. It is Saddam who invaded an Arab 
state. It is Saddam who now threatens the Arab nation," Bush said. "We, by 
contrast, seek to assist our Arab friends in their hour of need." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader, Bush noted, has tried to portray the conflict "as a struggle 
between the 'haves' and the 'have nots.' " 
</P>
<P>
"But Iraq is one of the 'haves,' " he noted, a country that has the 
second-largest oil reserves in the world but which is poor today because of 
Hussein's "ruinous policies of war against other Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also vigorously rebutted domestic critics who have charged that only minor 
economic interests, not truly fundamental national interests, are at stake in 
the anti-Iraq campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"What is at stake is truly vital," Bush said. "Energy resources are key -- not 
just to the functioning of this country but to the entire world. Our jobs, our 
way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries all around 
the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell 
into the hands of that one man, Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, said Bush, the U.S. effort is needed "not simply to protect 
resources or real estate, but to protect the freedom of nations." 
</P>
<P>
"Our action in the gulf is about fighting aggression" and "keeping our solemn 
word of honor," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke, King Hussein, who arrived in Washington Wednesday morning 
piloting his private jet, was resting at a downtown luxury hotel. Today, 
Hussein plans to fly to Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H. From there, he 
will travel by helicopter to Bush's Kennebunkport vacation home, arriving about 
noon for a meeting of 1 1/2 or two hours, White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has had no indication that the king is bearing a message 
from Saddam Hussein, Fitzwater added, saying: "We have no expectations one way 
or the other." Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as the President 
returned to Kennebunkport, Fitzwater said that Bush would discuss with the king 
U.S. concerns about Jordan's being used as a conduit for Iraqi trade, in 
defiance of the U.N.-ordered sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll tell him what our problems are," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking briefly to reporters as he played golf after returning to 
Kennebunkport on Wednesday afternoon, avoided questions about the meeting. 
"Just wait and see what happens," he said. "Don't want to answer any 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat said that the Jordanian king is 
carrying a message to Bush from Iraq but that Mashat did not know the content. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military buildup in and around Saudi Arabia now includes about 25,000 
troops on the ground. Another 35,000 sailors, airmen and Marines are on the 
armada of ships in the waters surrounding the region, with tens of thousands 
still on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials presented Bush with a series of estimates of how much the 
military deployment will cost, depending on how many troops eventually are 
sent, how long they stay and, most important, whether they actually have to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Because the bulk of the military's costs come from paying its soldiers, whether 
they are in Saudi Arabia or the United States, the immediate budget impact is 
not huge. But for the Pentagon, already under orders to find ways to cut 
spending, the strain is noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
The cost will balloon if fighting breaks out. Pentagon planners have long 
assumed that a full-scale battle could cost $1 billion a day or more. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials also informed Navy captains Wednesday of the rules that will 
govern the U.S. "interdiction" of ships carrying goods to Iraq. The rules 
authorize Navy vessels to use force to stop blockade runners. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Customs Service officials announced the arrest in Florida of a 
German and a Spaniard indicted on charges of having tried to buy TOW anti-tank 
missiles for Libya. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the two men tried to arrange the export of 10,000 
armor-piercing TOW missiles and 20,000 artillery shells, half of them capable 
of releasing poison gas upon impact. The weapons, according to the indictment, 
were to be shipped to Libya for eventual use by Iraq, Iran or another Middle 
Eastern country. The purchase price was $160 million, Customs Commissioner 
Carol Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is part of a continuing Customs effort to intercept illegal weapons 
shipments.

STATE PANEL SAYS MALATHION NO SERIOUS HEALTH THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
SPRAYING: A FEW OF THE 26 EXPERTS WON'T ENTIRELY RULE OUT A SLIM RISK OF CANCER 
FROM THE INSECTICIDE.

<P>
A state panel of scientists and physicians has concluded that malathion 
spraying poses no serious health threat, after reviewing existing scientific 
studies, although a few of the 26 panelists are quibbling about whether they 
can entirely rule out a slim cancer threat. 
</P>
<P>
The study group was created by the Deukmejian Administration with the hope of 
allaying public fears about aerial spraying of the pesticide, which has been 
used to help fight the spread of Mexican fruit flies in San Diego County and to 
eradicate Mediterranean fruit flies in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
County and state officials said Wednesday that they expect the report, which 
will not be completed until next month but was made available this week in 
draft form, to satisfy most of the public but not all critics. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhaustive review confirms what we had all along believed to be true," 
said Dr. James W. Stratton, a state Department of Health Services 
epidemiologist coordinating the panel's work. "The small amount of malathion 
used in the Medfly program is not a public health risk." 
</P>
<P>
The aerial Medfly program used 2.8 ounces of the pesticide per acre each 
spraying, although most of the 536 square miles that were sprayed received 
repeated applications. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who has emerged as a leading critic 
of malathion spraying, dismissed the report as "nothing more than a study to 
validate an existing position." 
</P>
<P>
"They just rehashed old stuff rather than do any of the new studies that are 
desperately needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the yearlong spaying program is on hold as Medfly eradication 
officials wait to see if the fruit- and vegetable-destroying pests show up in 
sufficient numbers in traps to justify ordering malathion-spraying helicopters 
aloft once again. 
</P>
<P>
Since completion of the latest round of spraying late last month, officials 
report that only two lone flies have been trapped -- one in Sherman Oaks and 
another in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the spraying promptly denounced the 400-page report by the Public 
Health Effects Advisory Committee as a whitewash and worse. 
</P>
<P>
Critics focused on a possible split within the panel's cancer subcommittee over 
whether a cancer risk from malathion can be entirely ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harvey Karp, a Santa Monica pediatrician and one of two dissenters on the 
12-member subcommittee, played down the apparent split. He contradicted 
predictions from spraying critics that he and Dr. Samuel I. Roth, a retired 
Woodland Hills internist, were committed to filing a minority report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not much of a disagreement, really," he said. "It's just an issue of 
semantics. Dr. Roth and I are interpreting the definition of what constitutes a 
risk rather strictly." 
</P>
<P>
Karp said he and Roth, who was not available for comment, were awaiting precise 
data on how much malathion residents had been exposed to by spraying before 
determining if they would file a minority report. 
</P>
<P>
"But I expect that when we get the exposure information, we will conclude that 
the cancer risk is negligible," he said. "When all is said and done, we may all 
be in total agreement within the subcommittee." 
</P>
<P>
The draft report by the cancer subcommittee, which Stratton said reflects the 
majority view, concludes that "studies do not provide evidence for the 
carcinogenicity of malathion." 
</P>
<P>
Karp added that "all subcommittee members, including me, feel there is no 
strong evidence of cancer risk. There appears to be only a tiny bit of 
evidence, and it is weak evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Patty Prickett of Residents Against the Spraying of Pesticides said her group 
"expected a whitewash, and that's what it appears we are getting." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that panelists, in their public discussions over the past six months, 
often cited a lack of evidence of public risk from malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me if the case for the safety of spraying is not proved, then you 
don't put millions of people at risk by spraying them 10 times or more," 
Prickett said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this group ever had any serious intent to look into the health 
risks," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, referring to what he termed a "major split" on the cancer subcommittee, 
predicted the report "would have little credibility in the community." 
</P>
<P>
He repeated charges aired at hearings he conducted recently at City Hall that 
"less than 15% of the people who got sick from the spraying in Los Angeles ever 
reported it to authorities, and there was little or no follow-up on those who 
did." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many gaps in the investigation into public health problems 
from the spraying that no one can draw any conclusions," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, named in January by State Health Director Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, is 
composed of scientists, physicians, public health specialists, toxicologists 
and statisticians. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stuart Siegel, co-chair and head of the department of hematology-oncology 
at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, called the panel's work the "most 
comprehensive review of existing data that has ever been done, even by the 
federal government." 
</P>
<P>
Panelists, he said, have spent "countless hours reading and discussing 
virtually every significant study ever done on the subject." Panel meetings 
were open to the public and were followed closely by critics of the spraying 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy said Wednesday that 
he was "guardedly optimistic" that the yearlong Medfly infestation has been 
defeated with aerial malathion spraying and the release of sterile Medflies, 
which mate with fertile flies and produce no offspring. 
</P>
<P>
But Spaugy said agricultural officials will not be confident of victory until 
they get through August and September -- months that in prior outbreaks have 
proved to be times of high activity among the pests -- with traps largely free 
of Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping the corks in the champagne bottles until the end of September," 
he said.

SENATE BACKS TRUMP PLAN FOR L.A. SITE BUT ASSEMBLY BALKS 
</P>

<P>
The state Senate voted Wednesday night to support a newly launched political 
effort aimed at helping Donald Trump block construction of a high school on the 
old Ambassador Hotel site in Los Angeles' mid-Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's upper chamber then approved a proposed $800-million bond 
issue negotiated by Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders for school 
construction statewide. 
</P>
<P>
A cantankerous Assembly, however, got tangled up in the Trump issue and other 
disputes and shot down a separate $325-million bond bill sponsored by 
Deukmejian aimed at helping middle-income Californians buy their first homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly action threatened to unravel a hefty $3.6-billion package of bond 
issues fashioned by the governor and the legislative leadership for the Nov. 6 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Trump amendment" making it more expensive for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District to purchase the 17-acre Ambassador site was contained 
in the $800-million bond package for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the Trump plan, proposed by Deukmejian and agreed to by the Assembly 
and Senate leaders, would restrict the state's contribution toward purchase of 
school land to $2.25 million an acre. For the Ambassador site, this translates 
to a state contribution of about $39 million, instead of $50 million previously 
promised by the State Allocation Board. Trump, owner of the Ambassador site, 
wants to build a giant skyscraper there. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), a supporter of building the school on the 
former hotel land, led an unsuccessful effort to beat down the "Trump 
amendment." He lost on a lopsided 23-12 vote that split the Los Angeles 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want us to buy the Ambassador Hotel," he told the Senate. "This is 
really what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
But Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), usually a backer of the 
school district, "most reluctantly" opposed Torres, asserting that $2.25 
million per acre "is an awful lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
For Trump to build the skyscraper, Roberti insisted, "is reasonable, makes 
sense, is economical." He said the mid-Wilshire district "needs an infusion of 
private dollars, not public dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The school bond issue never came up in the Assembly, which got bogged down 
debating the governor's housing bill. That measure was rejected in a bipartisan 
assault described by some members as a revolt against the legislative 
leadership. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said it would be a 
"waste of time" to take up any other bond measures Wednesday night, because 
Deukmejian would not sign them unless he got approval for his housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who carried the bill on the floor, 
attributed its rejection in part to the uproar over the Ambassador Hotel site. 
</P>
<P>
"Brown and Roberti cut a deal that their members want to renegotiate," Nolan 
said. "The L.A. legislators try to leverage everything they can to have money 
pour into the city of L.A. to the exclusion of the rest of the state." 
</P>
<P>
But Speaker Brown said the school fight was not linked to the housing bill. 
Whatever happens on the Trump site, he said, the housing package would probably 
have to be amended to allay the concerns of lawmakers who complained that the 
program would help the well-to-do buy fancy homes in expensive areas while 
failing to adequately address the problems of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The measure's critics complained that it would allow a couple earning $84,000 a 
year in San Mateo County to buy a home valued as high as $240,000 with a 
low-interest loan from the state covering almost half of the sales price. 
</P>
<P>
Needing 54 votes for passage, the bill received only 29.

Not a single Asian-American holds a seat in the California Legislature and none 
held a seat last year when a bill was introduced making it a crime to eat dog. 
</P>
<P>
No one rose from the floor to explain that while dog meat is a delicacy in some 
Asian regions, the mere thought makes most Asian-Americans shudder. And no one 
warned that some would surely view the bill as an ethnic slur. 
</P>

But behind the scenes, a cadre of influential Asian-Americans went into action. 
These were not elected officials, but well-placed aides to powerful 
politicians. Armed with political savvy, legislative know-how and the ear of 
their bosses, some of them set to work to take the bite out of the "dog bill." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation that Gov. George Deukmejian ultimately signed made it a crime 
to kill and eat domestic pets -- language that did not implicate any ethnic 
group. In an unusual message, the governor also called for a follow-up bill to 
make sure no pet-eater goes to jail. 
</P>
<P>
One of every 10 Californians now is of Asian heritage, and the fraction is 
growing fast. However, Asian-Americans are vastly underrepresented in elected 
posts -- a legacy of both discrimination and a traditional distrust of 
politics. Asian-Americans hold only 2% of the state's top 300 elected offices 
and only 1% of city council and school board seats. In Washington, only two of 
California's 47-member congressional delegation are of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 elections offer little hope for improvement. As in previous years, few 
Asians are candidates, and those who are running generally face tough 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But into this political vacuum has stepped a new generation of Asian-Americans 
who have landed jobs as legislative aides and analysts, consultants, 
researchers, press secretaries, campaign managers, attorneys and advisers. 
</P>
<P>
They are the first to say they are no substitute for elected representatives. 
But as they begin to climb the political ladder, they are having a subtle but 
substantive effect on public policy in California. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're seeing now is that Asians are not only donating money, but asking 
to be partners in the process," said James Lee, 26, state press secretary for 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. "More Asians my age are coming to work in campaigns and 
doing pretty well. . . . They are really going into positions where they are 
having a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
Like their black and Latino counterparts, Asian staffers were once hired 
primarily to help lawmakers cover their flanks in heavily minority districts. 
Nowadays, those aides are increasingly likely to be public policy professionals 
juggling issues that affect all citizens, from health to transportation to 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not just 'the Asian staff person' where we handle Asian complaints or 
bills which have the title 'Asian' in the bill," said Dale Shimasaki, 36, a 
special assistant who handles education issues for Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco). "We're trying to diversify ourselves in public policy 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
These staffers are rarely quoted -- except when touting their bosses' 
accomplishments. But they have put their stamp on such issues as discrimination 
in Asian admissions to the University of California, divestment from South 
Africa, redress for Japanese-Americans interned during World War II and the 
portrayal of that incident in state publications and textbooks, bilingual 
education, school funding, hate crimes and redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress approved reparations to Japanese-American internees, for example, 
the payments were exempted from federal taxes. Priscilla Ouchida, an aide to 
Assemblyman Pat Johnston (D-Stockton), realized that state taxes would still 
apply and wrote a bill to also exempt the reparations from California taxes. 
Johnston introduced the bill in the Assembly, and Ouchida enlisted 
Asian-American staffers on the Senate side to smooth its voyage through the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Asian staffers also played a role in bringing the question of discrimination in 
UC Berkeley admissions to a head by taking the issue directly to Brown and 
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, aides, politicians 
and community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
After aides arranged for the leaders to meet with the Asian American Task Force 
on UC Admissions, Brown in March, 1987, backed a resolution calling on UC 
Berkeley to disclose its admissions policies. And Roberti asked the state 
auditor general to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed both houses unanimously in September of that year. Three 
months later, then-UC Berkeley Chancellor Michael Heyman apologized for the way 
the university had handled the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Had the (Asian) community gone to a member that didn't have an Asian-American 
staff member, it probably would have happened, but it might have taken a year 
more," said Shimasaki, a Berkeley alumnus who drafted the resolution for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 64 Asian- or Pacific-Americans hold professional jobs as aides to state 
senators or representatives, according to Maeley Tom, special assistant in 
Roberti's Office of Asian and Pacific Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started here 17 years ago, we were able to count them on one 
hand," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento staffers are a tight-knit bunch who keep in touch through their 
own group, the Asian Legislative Staff Caucus. A similar group, the Southern 
California Asian/Pacific Legislative Staff Caucus, includes at least 29 other 
aides to legislators, mayors, city council members, supervisors and 
congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian community is pushing for more. 
</P>
<P>
"When anyone calls, the first thing I ask is, 'What have you done for the Asian 
community?' " Maria Hsia, a fund-raiser and political activist, said of 
politicians asking for help. "If they are not even going to hire Asian staff, I 
don't see that they're very sincere about trying to understand Asians." 
</P>
<P>
There are some Asian-American political veterans such as Jadine Neilson, who 
started as a receptionist in U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston's San Francisco office 18 
years ago. Now she directs his California staff of 20 and, significantly, his 
schedule. Sacramento has a veteran Chinese-American power couple, legislative 
aide Tom and her husband, Ronald L. Tom, a lobbyist who was once a pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
But most staffers are in their 20s and 30s. Democrats far outnumber 
Republicans. Many work in nearly all-white districts. Most -- like Audrey Noda, 
an aide to Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) -- set their sights on politics 
early. 
</P>
<P>
As a fledgling legislative aide in 1982, Noda was assigned to draft what became 
known as the "Peking duck bill" on behalf of Chinese restaurant owners, whose 
ancient method of hanging the ducks at room temperature was under assault by 
Los Angeles health inspectors. Torres, whose district includes parts of 
Chinatown, Koreatown and Little Tokyo, successfully sponsored a bill to permit 
the traditional method of preparing Peking duck. At 32, Noda is now Torres' 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Like Noda, most aides are second-, third- or even fourth-generation Americans. 
Some of their parents and grandparents fled corrupt or brutal governments and 
saw politics as a dangerous, disreputable, or -- at best -- an unseemly 
pursuit. But the children thrill to the rough-and-tumble of American politics. 
</P>
<P>
"In Asia, your father wants you to be a doctor," said Hung Trung Le, 35, once a 
medical student in Vietnam and now an aide to Assemblyman Phil Isenberg, 
(D-Sacramento). "But this is a free country. I want to do what I want to do. . 
. . Even now, my father thinks I'm crazy. He wants me to get a stable job." 
</P>
<P>
Staffers like Le, who is so blunt that his friends call him "Uzi mouth," smash 
any lingering stereotypes of Asians as quiet, studious, technical whizzes who 
don't make waves. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are going to explode that myth quickly if it hasn't been exploded 
already," said Kam Kuwata, a 36-year-old Venice-based political consultant who 
is slated to manage Cranston's reelection campaign in 1992. "It doesn't mean 
we're going to be bomb-throwers. It means the stereotype isn't accurate -- 
wasn't then, isn't now." 
</P>
<P>
A few of today's staffers say they want to become tomorrow's candidates. They 
are well-positioned to do so, according to scholar Fernando Guerra, head of the 
Chicano studies department at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
Guerra said that more than one-third of all black, Latino and Asian 
officeholders in California did stints as political aides -- including all six 
minority members of the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best base for an ethnic to run," Guerra said. Staffers know the 
district and the donors, how to organize a campaign and whom to hire, he said. 
"They take on all of the advantages that the incumbent has, except one, and 
that is name identification. But that can be made up with enough financial 
backing." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the two top Asian-American challengers on the ballot this fall trained 
in behind-the-scenes political jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Butte County Democrat Lon Hatamiya, who once worked for Torres, would become 
the first Asian-American in the Legislature in more than a decade if he 
succeeds in unseating Republican Chris Chandler in the Yuba City-based 3rd 
Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
And the Republican candidate for state controller, Matthew (Kip) Fong, cut his 
political teeth working for his mother, Secretary of State March Fong Eu, the 
first and only Asian-American to hold a statewide constitutional office. 
</P>
<P>
But other staffers say they prefer to wield power behind the throne. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my personal life private," said Esther Kim, 23, an aide to Assemblyman 
Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento staffers count 20 to 30 lawmakers who are dependably sympathetic 
to Asian-American interests -- which often coincide with Latino concerns. The 
aides call such members surrogates. Nevertheless, Ouchida and others say they 
are wary of overstepping their bounds by pushing what might be seen as 
special-interest legislation too often. 
</P>
<P>
"I time my bills five years apart," Ouchida said. "I figure you can only go to 
the well every once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have . . . a vote on the floor so, by default, staff become the 
members for the Asian community," said Shimizu. "That isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
Staffers point to the dog bill, saying it would have been killed if one of 
their own had held a seat in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate, the Cambodian Assn. of America backed the ban on dog-eating. 
They argued that it would lessen anti-Asian discrimination, which they said had 
been inflamed by the arrest of two Cambodian immigrants in Long Beach for 
killing a puppy. And several lawmakers ordinarily sympathetic to Asians sided 
with animal rights activists instead. 
</P>
<P>
A number of the Asian staffers are still smarting over that loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a testament to the insensitivity of the governor and the Legislature on 
Asian issues," fumed Nguyen T. Nguyen, a Vietnamese-born consultant to the 
Legislature's Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement, who argues that the law 
is vague and bound to be applied in a discriminatory fashion against new Asian 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the first person arrested for eating my goldfish," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was a 1989 Assembly debate on how textbooks should describe the 
Japanese-American internment. During the debate, Rep. Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach) incensed Asian-Americans by referring to the internees as "American 
Japs." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Ferguson's colleagues stood up and blasted him from the floor. 
Still, said Maeley Tom, "Our feeling is that if we had Asian-Pacific members on 
the floor, I don't think any member would have the courage to look a fellow 
member in the eye and say, 'You Jap.' It just shows what lack of representation 
means."

KOREAN LIBERATION DAY MARKED WITH FIERY RIOT

<P>
South Korea on Wednesday celebrated the 45th anniversary of its liberation from 
Japanese colonization with a ritual of fiery student protest. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 demonstrators battled riot police at the gates of Yonsei 
University in western Seoul in a futile attempt to march to the border with 
North Korea for a Communist-sponsored reunification rally. 
</P>
<P>
Policemen fired tear gas into the throng of students, who scattered and 
regrouped to respond with firebombs and rocks. The authorities not only blocked 
the student march but at the same time prevented a caravan of buses carrying 
dissidents from leaving the campus for the border. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said more than 100 people were injured and about 350 
arrested in the two-hour confrontation, according to press reports. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, radical students hurling firebombs and shouting anti-American 
slogans attacked a U.S. Army facility near downtown Seoul, police said. But a 
spokesman for the U.S. 8th Army said there were no injuries and no significant 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Violent protest on Liberation Day has become a tradition in recent years. Aug. 
15 is not only the date when Japan surrendered to the Allies at the end of 
World War II but also the beginning of the Korean peninsula's division into 
Soviet and U.S. spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, South Korean students have tried to march to the 
border truce village of Panmunjom for rallies with their counterparts from 
North Korea. This year, public expectations were running especially high after 
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo declared his intention to open the border to 
free travel between the two Koreas. But the Seoul government scrapped the plan 
after both sides raised procedural obstacles to the exchange of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea had a rally Wednesday on its side of the demarcation line in 
Panmunjom, but without the South Korean delegates it had invited. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea had its rally in Imjingak, just south of the border. It was 
attended by an estimated 2,000 people separated from relatives in the north. 
Pro-government demonstrators accused North Korea of foiling the border opening. 
Like the dissidents, they were blocked from entering Panmunjom by South Korean 
police.

$170-BILLION TRUST FUND BURNING HOLES IN NEEDY FEDERAL POCKETS;

<P>
What's the best way to spend $170 billion? 
</P>
<P>
Even as the federal deficit has widened, Social Security reserves have 
mushroomed, quadrupling since 1986 alone, to $170 billion this spring. With 
that rising surplus, one of the few bright spots in the federal ledger, all 
kinds of proposals have been made for its use. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Social Security surplus funds are invested in government securities, 
primarily Treasury bonds. The reason for doing so, supporters say, is to put 
aside some extra funds to help today's generation of workers finance their own 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the federal government is, in effect, borrowing from Social Security 
surpluses to help reduce current budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, among them Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), feel that this 
is an inappropriate use of the trust funds and have begun to put forth other 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payroll Tax Cut 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan has suggested simply cutting the Social Security payroll tax. Late in 
September, the Senate is expected to vote on his proposal that the Social 
Security bite from wages be reduced to 5.1% from 6.2%. Moynihan thinks that the 
system should "pay as it goes," by collecting just what it needs for the 
present and returning any surplus, so that workers can save or invest their 
money as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposals are more elaborate. Their authors say that Social Security 
should keep collecting money at the same rate, but should use it for creative, 
ambitious and socially responsible investments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure Repairs 
</P>
<P>
Another bill, presented by Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), would use the 
surplus funds to pay for infrastructure repairs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Under that plan, a new Social Security Investment Board would buy state and 
municipal bonds issued to finance the building and repair of bridges, roads and 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
"The Social Security trust fund and the nation's infrastructure problems may 
seem unrelated on the surface," Matsui said, "but a crucial common thread holds 
them bound -- the future economic well-being of the nation." Economic 
productivity is dependent on the infrastructure, Matsui said, and future 
salaries and contributions to the Social Security system are dependent on 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui's plan would stipulate that, to prevent over-reliance on Social Security 
funds, the system could buy no more than 25% of state and municipal bonds 
nationwide. The President's Advisory Council on Social Security has criticized 
Matsui's plan, however, pointing out that state and municipal bonds usually 
have a lower rate of return than Treasury bonds, and therefore would earn less 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is being reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Loans 
</P>
<P>
Another plan would have the trust fund invested in higher education through an 
overhaul of the student loan system. 
</P>
<P>
"What better investment than in the education and training of our young 
people?" asked Barry Bluestone, principal author of the "education equity" 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boom generation's retirement after the turn of the century will 
"create generational antagonism with the baby bust generation, who are going to 
have to foot the bill for their (elders') retirement," Bluestone said. He 
favors abandoning what he calls the current "baffling array" of student loan 
and grant programs and lending Social Security funds instead. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, students would take out Social Security loans essentially in 
the same way they now borrow from banks. After graduation they would repay the 
loans through payroll deductions adjusted to their income. 
</P>
<P>
"The demographic trends over the next half century or so work in favor of the 
program," Bluestone said in a recent article. The money can be used now to 
ensure a well-educated population in the future, he said, so that "30 years 
from now, when the Social Security system will need those funds to cover its 
obligations to retirees, education equity will be generating a positive cash 
flow back to Social Security" from payment on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
His idea has not yet been proposed as legislation, but several lawmakers have 
expressed interest in it, Bluestone said.

Vandalism and battery are rarely headline-grabbing crimes, but Father Michael 
Pfleger hopes his trial on those charges next month will help ignite a national 
drive to rid minority neighborhoods of liquor and cigarette billboards. 
</P>
<P>
Pfleger, an outspoken Roman Catholic priest, has been accused of defacing 
outdoor signs and tossing paint on the owner of a billboard company who tried 
to stop him. In an echo of a civil rights theme from the days of lunch counter 
sit-ins and bus boycotts, Pfleger plans to argue that he has a "moral 
necessity" to fight what he contends is saturation advertising of harmful 
substances in poor parts of town. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the case highlights a budding conflict between the 
demands of social crusaders and the rights of advertisers to promote their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
THE CRITICS: Last year, nearly 20% of the billboard industry's $1.487 billion 
in revenue was earned from tobacco and liquor ads, trade group figures show. 
Although signs hawking cigarettes or beer can be found almost anywhere in the 
country, critics contend that they are abnormally concentrated in low-income 
areas or neighborhoods where blacks and Latinos live. 
</P>
<P>
Scenic America, a Washington-based anti-billboard group, said surveys in 
Baltimore, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis, Atlanta and other cities have found 
that the vast majority of billboards in minority neighborhoods promote tobacco 
or alcohol. The numbers in white neighborhoods are far lower. 
</P>
<P>
Pfleger, who is white, said he recently counted every billboard within a 
10-block radius of his all-black South Side parish and found 118 pasted with 
cigarette or liquor ads. By contrast, in a similar-size white neighborhood on 
the city's North Side, he found only three cigarette or liquor signs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you target a particular race of people with (ads for) two of the nation's 
top killers, that's genocide," Pfleger charged. 
</P>
<P>
THE INDUSTRY: Spokesmen for billboard companies cite such criticism as a 
classic case of attacking the messenger rather than the message. They do not 
deny that billboard pitches are tailored to appeal to particular ethnic groups 
but say that so-called "targeting" is a common, cost-effective practice in all 
forms of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Billboard firms say that complaints from Pfleger and others have led them to 
reevaluate the positioning of some of their signs and they have voluntarily 
moved liquor and cigarette ads farther from schools and churches. But Steve 
Shinn, a spokesman for Gannett Outdoor Advertising of Chicago, one of five 
major billboard companies operating here, said critics are trying to legislate 
morality and limit free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very paternalistic attitude to say these people (in minority 
neighborhoods) don't have the ability to make their own decisions," Shinn said. 
" . . . If I don't agree that the Catholic Church should have bingo games 
because I don't believe in gambling, should I have the right to whitewash their 
bingo signs?" 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Pfleger's trial is set for Sept. 11. Meanwhile, more billboards on the 
South Side continue to be hit by vandals, who mar their messages with paint or 
antismoking and antidrinking graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
And the City Council, under the sponsorship of one of Mayor Richard M. Daley's 
floor leaders, is considering what could be the most sweeping anti-tobacco 
ordinance in the country. It would not only ban outdoor tobacco advertising but 
might virtually forbid the operation of cigarette vending machines as well as 
raise the legal smoking age to 19 from 18.

Take lobbyist Edward J. van Kloberg III, who jokingly used the nickname "the 
beast of Baghdad" to refer to his client, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in an 
interview with the Washington Post last month. The flamboyant Van Kloberg was 
not so jocular Wednesday, saying: "Our arrangement terminated in July." 
</P>
<P>
Take Richard M. Fairbanks III, the former assistant secretary of state who was 
one of President Bush's chief foreign policy advisers during the 1988 campaign. 
Also listed on the most recent roster of Iraq's lobbyists, Fairbanks said that 
his relationship with Baghdad was limited to legal work and that he resigned in 
March. Attorney-client privilege prevents him from revealing his reasons, 
Fairbanks added, but "obviously if we had felt comfortable with the 
arrangement, we would have continued it." 
</P>
<P>
There's also Mary E. King, the well-connected former Jimmy Carter 
Administration official known in days gone by as a stalwart of the U.S. civil 
rights movement. As executive director of the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum, King 
squired Iraqi officials around, making sure that they were introduced in the 
right social and political circles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make speeches and I don't give interviews and I'm very busy," King 
said in response to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
It was not so long ago that Iraq had plenty of friends in Washington. 
Particularly during its eight-year war with Iran, when the United States took a 
decidedly pro-Iraqi tilt, many people were willing to knock on the doors of the 
powerful on Iraq's behalf, acting either as representatives of the government 
itself or those who wanted to do business with it. 
</P>
<P>
Since last week, it has been U.S. policy to strangle the Iraqi economy with an 
international embargo. But things looked pretty cozy as recently as January, 
when the Commerce Department, under pressure from business, was planning an 
aerospace trade mission that would include a stop in Iraq aimed at making sure 
U.S. companies got in on the action there. 
</P>
<P>
In the Commerce Department's news release announcing the trade mission, the 
department noted that Iraq is among the countries that will "offer numerous 
consulting opportunities in aviation service, maintenance and the avionics 
equipment market. . . . Iraq has ambitious plans for upgrading its civil 
aviation system, including new airports, air traffic control and related 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Weeks before the trade mission was supposed to take place, six Iraqi agents 
were caught in London engaging in another type of commerce -- trying to smuggle 
40 American-made nuclear bomb triggers into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Wolf, the trade mission coordinator, insists that the idea for 
including Baghdad in the trip never got past the planning stages. The proposed 
stop in Iraq was canceled because "we didn't like some of the things (the 
Iraqis) said," Wolf explained. "We were very prophetic and proper about it but 
we never get credit for it, do we?" 
</P>
<P>
There are still some who -- while not quite defending Hussein -- contend that 
he is not a total villain. 
</P>
<P>
"We've focused a little too much on his brutal side," said Marshall W. Wiley, 
the former ambassador to Oman who founded and heads the U.S.-Iraq Business 
Forum. "In a personal meeting with him, he can be charming." 
</P>
<P>
The forum is an organization composed of about 70 companies that were doing 
business in Iraq, or wanted to. Wiley said that it was funded solely by its 
members' dues and does not lobby Congress. Still, it regularly and publicly 
argued the other side against critics of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hussein wiped out thousands of his own people with chemical weapons, 
Wiley has often noted that he also fostered literacy and economic development. 
Wiley warns even now that the United States "has got to come to grips with the 
fact that Iraq is an emerging power" and should not back an unpopular and 
undemocratic monarchy in Kuwait, which was invaded Aug. 2 and annexed by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's social heyday in Washington was surely the mid-1980s, when Ambassador 
Nizar Hamdoon ran what the New York Times described as "one of the liveliest 
dinner tables in Washington." Hamdoon drew notables, including American Jewish 
leaders -- which seems particularly ironic in light of Hussein's subsequent 
threat to wipe out half the population of Israel with poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbanks insists that the U.S. position in the Iran-Iraq War was a sensible 
one, "based on U.S. national interests" of preventing a clear winner from 
emerging from the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
But California Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), one of Iraq's most 
dogged foes on Capitol Hill, says that the attitude persisted well past the 
war's end in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That continued until the day before the invasion," he said. "They all thought 
that Hussein could be a force for moderation." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Administration and many in Congress opposed his bill banning 
arms and high-tech exports to Iraq, a bill that cleared the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee the day before the invasion. It quickly passed the House as 
Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Iraq has mounted what Berman described as a sophisticated 
lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, involving State Department officials, defense 
contractors, agricultural interests and Iraqi-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Berman said that he was even telephoned on Iraq's behalf by William P. Clark, 
after Clark retired in 1985 as President Reagan's national security adviser and 
began working as a Washington attorney. Clark's office said that he has never 
been engaged as a lobbyist by the government of Iraq. He is out of the country 
and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion, Berman said, "was just to me a demonstration of the lesson I 
think we should have learned a long time ago -- appeasing a bully doesn't work. 
It's not only a morally corrupt position but a politically stupid position."

TRUCKS FERRY WHEAT TO IRAQ AS JORDAN BALKS AT SHUTTING DOWN ITS AQABA PORT;

AQABA, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy trucks roared north out of Aqaba carrying wheat for Iraq on Wednesday as 
Jordanian officials looked for a way to keep the port open. 
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. Navy began turning shipping away from Iraq's ports on the 
Persian Gulf, this Jordanian port on an arm of the Red Sea has become the only 
one where cargo for Iraq can be landed. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, trucks were taking on wheat that had been unloaded into Aqaba's 
silos, then heading north to Amman and on east to Iraq. "We're on our way to 
Baghdad," one driver told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
At the Iraqi border, about 10 hours' drive away, reporters saw scores of trucks 
loaded with wheat. One of the drivers lined up there told a reporter that wheat 
supplies were getting low at Aqaba, even though Jordan has refused to go along 
with the United Nations-sanctioned embargo on trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has threatened to blockade Aqaba if it appears that the 
port is being used to supply Iraq. A U.S. naval force led by the aircraft 
carrier Eisenhower has been ordered to the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan is scheduled to meet with President Bush today, and the 
question of Aqaba is expected to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials were still equivocal Wednesday on the subject of applying 
the sanctions. The only thing that seemed clear is that Jordan, which depends 
heavily on Iraq for oil and other trade, is searching for a way out. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan is feeling the pinch," Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother, 
told the press. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials put forth several proposals calculated to avoid taking part 
in the sanctions. For one thing, they said, Jordan should have a 30-day grace 
period. And they said they are considering asking the United Nations for an 
exemption because their economy is tightly entwined with Iraq's. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Jordan finds itself in a situation like that of the 
countries that border on South Africa, which have quietly continued to trade 
with South Africa, with tacit U.N. approval, despite the sanctions imposed on 
that country. 
</P>
<P>
For a second day in a row, Prince Hassan hinted that Jordan will need foreign 
aid to make up for any reduction in trade with Iraq. Jordan receives most of 
its oil from Iraq and sends much of its exports to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It is not at all clear that President Bush, who has moved quickly to tighten 
the sanctions, will be patient with Jordan if it hesitates much longer. Bush 
has commented favorably, however, on the question of compensation. 
</P>
<P>
There was evident tension at Aqaba, where Jordanian officials confirmed that 
two ships had refused to unload cargo in recent days. But they said the problem 
had to do with payments from Iraqi buyers, not politics. 
</P>
<P>
Freight forwarders said the port authorities forced the ship captains to unload 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Jordanian officials "intervened" to persuade a Norwegian captain 
to unload wheat, the freight forwarders said. In another case, an anchored 
Greek freighter carrying wheat and sugar suddenly cut communications with the 
port. When officials went to investigate, they found that the ship's radio had 
been sabotaged. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was then towed to a pier, but the captain still refused to unload 
until the owner of the vessel arrived. Even then only a fraction of the cargo 
was taken off, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have not been permitted to visit ships docked at the port. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the port said they are confused about their government's position. 
Port Director Awad Tell said that ships may still come in, but Bassam Kakish, 
who as regional development director is the king's direct representative, said 
the U.N. sanctions are being applied. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tell and Kakish both said that no ship of any nationality had arrived 
in port for two days. 
</P>
<P>
Freight forwarders said three ships arrived but had anchored and refused to 
come in and unload their cargoes. In all, there were eight freighters docked 
and four others anchored out. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic at the port is down. Port Director Tell recalled that in the early 
years of Iraq's war with Iran, there were times when as many as 100 ships were 
lined up here with cargo for Iraq. Iraq's ports on the Persian Gulf were 
blocked by wreckage then and under constant threat of bombardment by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kakish, the development director, the number of ships calling at 
Aqaba in recent years has averaged about 25 a day. The port employs 2,500 
full-time workers and several hundred part-time workers. It has berths for 20 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
Aqaba's townsfolk appear to be aware of the precarious situation at the port 
and alarmed at the economic implications. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no money here," Daniel Hagop, a clerk in a photography studio, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Naim abu Mafhouz, a rug merchant, said, "We will eat dates and water to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Tourists on the beach were calling home to advise friends and relatives that 
they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
"But they will start to leave soon," predicted Mohammed Zghoul, an assistant 
manager at a large beachfront hotel.

OIL SHEIKDOMS STRUGGLE TO CARRY ON AMID WAR JITTERS; 
</P>
<P>
FALLOUT: THE INITIAL SHOCK OF IRAQ'S INVASION PASSES. LINGERING FEARS CAN BE 
MEASURED IN ECONOMIC TERMS.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, war jitters have eased but not 
disappeared in the oil sheikdoms on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In the United Arab Emirates, major developments heard on radio newscasts are 
passed quickly into the streets. Cab drivers give passengers the latest word. 
In Qatar and Bahrain, travelers say, the anxiety appears to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
But in all three countries, the initial shock has passed, commerce continues 
and cautious regimes are working hard to tamp down rumors and build confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 days of the crisis, Arab and foreign communities alike were 
caught up in nervous uncertainty, despite a steady flow of assurances. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed ibn Rashid, the Emirates' defense minister, said in a statement 
that appeared on the front page of local newspapers that today's fast-moving 
events are "incidental and transitory." The people of the Emirates, Arab and 
expatriate, "will remain bound together . . . in good times and bad," he said, 
in an "oasis of security, love and peace." 
</P>
<P>
Rashid's optimistic rhetoric came on the heels of advisories last week from 
Washington, London and other capitals that foreigners should consider leaving 
the gulf region. The Soviet government said Wednesday that it will begin 
evacuating women and children among its nationals in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Regional banks reported increased withdrawals by foreign depositors, and travel 
agencies were bombarded with requests for bookings on outbound flights. 
</P>
<P>
Anxiety over the rising military confrontation along the Saudi-Kuwaiti frontier 
threatened to shred the alliance of Arabs and expatriates that built the oil 
fortunes of the gulf states in the 1970s and '80s. Editorialists pointed 
fingers at a few foreign managers who reportedly packed up their families and 
left suddenly for holidays at home. 
</P>
<P>
But the feared mass flight of expatriates has not taken place, according to 
airline officials. Planes are overbooked but are leaving with empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers tend to be overcautious," said K. B. N. Nair, airport manager here 
for Air India. "There are cases of travelers making a series of bookings on 
different days on different airlines. These create an artificial situation." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, anxiety continues, and its ups and downs can be measured in 
economic terms. For example: 
</P>
<P>
Insurance rates for shipping in the gulf have risen, as they did during the 
tense years of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War. Underwriters have raised rates for 
general shipping and added a premium for vessels planning to call at ports in 
Iraq or Kuwait. During the 1980s war, when there was open conflict in the gulf, 
insurers lost more than $1 billion. One life insurance company in Dubai this 
week reported 75 callers in one day asking whether their policies covered war 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion of Kuwait touched off a brief rise in food prices. Government 
declarations that stocks were sufficient eased concerns, however, and the price 
of a 40-pound sack of rice fell from about $80 on the weekend to $64 at 
midweek. Government and consumer spokesmen accused traders of taking advantage 
of nervous shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on an alert from currency officials in Qatar, banks and 
currency-exchange shops were warned about the sudden appearance of counterfeit 
American bank notes in the region. In the days immediately after the Iraqi 
invasion, many sought to change their local currency for dollars, their fears 
spurred by the overnight collapse of the Kuwaiti dinar. 
</P>
<P>
In Dubai, where the economy is buoyed by oil but focused on trade, newspapers 
list on their front pages the exchange rates for a variety of foreign 
currencies, along with the price of commodities, shares on foreign exchanges 
and gold jewelry, a popular form of investment among Arabs and foreign workers. 
</P>
<P>
A bright note was found by the English-language Khaleej Times, which reported 
the arrival of 40 West German tourists who, despite the threat of conflict, 
came in for two days of shopping, sunbathing and desert safaris.

SUGGESTED WAYS TO REDUCE OIL IMPORTS HAVE A FAMILIAR RING

Remember the "energy crisis," the "moral equivalent of war," lowered 
thermostats, a President wearing a sweater? 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department would just as soon not remind anyone of the last time 
around, but on Wednesday, Day 13 of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, Energy 
Secretary James D. Watkins unveiled a list of steps to reduce U.S. dependence 
on foreign oil. Several sounded hauntingly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the United States imported roughly 600,000 
barrels of oil each day from the two Middle Eastern nations now under an 
international embargo. Americans could replace 100,000 barrels a day of that 
missing oil simply by keeping the tires on their cars inflated to the proper 
pressure, Watkins said Wednesday. Soft tires increase friction and cut down on 
a car's fuel efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Another 50,000 barrels a day could be saved if drivers observed speed limits, 
according to government calculations. But the Bush Administration, at least for 
now, has no plans to ask that existing limits be lowered the way then-President 
Jimmy Carter did during the last big oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another 90,000 barrels could be saved by increased use of car and van 
pools, while 40,000 barrels could be saved if families that have two cars used 
the more efficient one when they have a choice. According to government 
statistics, more than half the households in America have two or more cars 
often with large disparities in fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those energy savings -- enough to make up about 280,000 barrels 
of oil daily -- Watkins said that increased supply measures could bring an 
additional 270,000 barrels of domestic oil to the market by the end of the 
year. A key part of that strategy is breaking an impasse over production from 
the Point Arguello oil project offshore from Santa Barbara, which Watkins 
estimated could produce 75,000 barrels a day.

MAN LEFT BRAIN DEAD BY DRUG-LACED DRINK MOVES

<TEXT>
<P>
The family of a man who lapsed into a coma three weeks ago after gulping down a 
cocaine-laced Colombian soft drink has reversed their decision to disconnect 
his respirator after seeing movement in his arm and leg for the second 
consecutive day Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say 25-year-old Maximo Rene Menendez is brain dead. But on Tuesday his 
mother, who was moments away from giving approval to have her son removed from 
a respirator, saw him move slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"We should get an explanation for those movements before we cut him off," said 
Philip M. Gerson, an attorney representing Menendez's mother, Margarita Rabaza. 
"The idea that she came so close to pulling the plug is very upsetting to her." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FBI has issued a nationwide alert for a Miami man involved in 
importing 1,000 cases of the soft drink, called Pony Malta de Bavaria, in what 
agents say was a new twist in an old game -- smuggling cocaine into the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Alfredo Rios, a 36-year-old Colombian, operated a Miami importing company 
that apparently brought in the drink in bottles bearing counterfeit labels. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, who was in the United States on an expired visa, disappeared soon after 
Menendez unsuspectingly drank from the bottle of tainted malta July 26. "We'd 
like to question him regarding this whole matter," said FBI spokesman Paul 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the FBI has tested more than 200 cases of the malta -- a sweet, 
syrupy drink made from sugar cane -- and found 45 contaminated bottles, each 
containing from 20 to 40 grams of cocaine. One gram is considered lethal. 
</P>
<P>
Another 483 cases of the same shipment are in the custody of federal agents in 
Jersey City, N.J. That leaves some 225 cases -- containing more than 8,000 
bottles -- missing and presumed dangerous, Miller said. It is unclear how the 
contaminated drinks found their way to the shelves of a Miami supermarket, 
where Menendez's mother bought several bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has ordered stores to stop selling Pony Malta. 
Menendez is the only known victim of the tainted drink. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, who in January joined his mother and stepfather in Miami after years 
of seeking permission to leave Cuba, suffered a heart attack immediately after 
downing the malta in his home. He was revived by paramedics, but fell into a 
coma soon after arriving at the hospital.

<P>
A presidential advisory panel Wednesday recommended sweeping changes to speed 
the delivery of new drugs to cancer and AIDS patients -- revisions that go 
beyond those that already have occurred in response to the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"For cancer and AIDS patients, time is running out," said the report by a 
special committee that is part of the President's Cancer Panel, which is headed 
by Armand Hammer. "Regulatory personnel . . . must adapt to these new needs and 
take a positive attitude toward such innovation." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental Petroleum Corp., 
presented the report to President Bush at a White House meeting Wednesday 
morning. The committee began its work in 1988 at the request of then Vice 
President George Bush, who was also chairman of the presidential task force on 
regulatory relief.

Pressure from AIDS activists has been largely responsible for a dramatic change 
in recent years in the philosophy governing the study of experimental drugs for 
life-threatening diseases. The change has brought an increasing willingness to 
make such drugs more quickly accessible to the desperately ill, even before 
critical scientific questions have been answered. 
</P>
<P>
"In my entire medical career, I've never found any patient advocacy group as 
effective" as the AIDS activists, said Dr. Louis Lasagna, dean of the Sackler 
School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences of Tufts University, who is chairman of 
the special committee. "They are smart. They are willing to be obnoxious. And 
they are adept at playing the political circuit." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "there has already been a big improvement" in the drug approval 
process, but much more needs to be done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It takes an average of seven years for a typical drug to make its way through 
the approval process from the earliest studies to market approval. In recent 
years, in part because of the climate created by AIDS, the process has been 
shortened, but critics say not nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The sick need neither hostility nor the bogging down in the quagmire of 
micromanagement," Lasagna said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended that a permanent policy and oversight committee be 
established by the secretary of health and human services to monitor the work 
of the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
"This committee should not have just the function of monitoring and prodding 
the FDA, but also of fighting for it when it is attacked from other quarters 
for doing the right thing," Lasagna said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the committee said that a national policy should be adopted "to foster 
the development of new drugs" for these diseases. No improvements in the 
process "will come up with the drugs we so desperately need" if there aren't 
any candidate drugs to "deliver the goods," Lasagna said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested new ways to further accelerate drug review. It proposed 
that the criteria for judging the effectiveness of a new drug be modified to 
include earlier so-called "endpoints." 
</P>
<P>
For example, proof of prolonged survival has been the main endpoint currently 
used in many studies to assess whether a drug is having an impact. The 
committee suggested that others be used, such as tumor shrinkage in more than 
20% to 30% of cancer patients in a study, or an increase in an AIDS patient's 
T4 helper cells, the immune system cells that are the primary target of the 
human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
The committee proposed also that at least one preapproval study phase be 
eliminated -- the phase that compares the experimental drug to drugs already on 
the market. "Such studies should be delayed until the marketing phase of drug 
development," the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended also that: 
</P>
<P>
Congress "give prompt attention to the inadequate resources, staff and 
facilities of the FDA." 
</P>
<P>
Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers "give identical coverage" for 
experimental drugs and "all ancillary medical care for cancer and AIDS 
patients" and that the coverage should not vary from region to region or 
carrier to carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Drug sponsors have the option of paying the FDA for outside review of new drug 
applications by "qualified experts with no conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA increase its flexibility by relying more frequently on the opinions of 
qualified experts who serve on its advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
There be more "informal, free, open interactive communication" between the FDA 
and drug sponsors, such as drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's official name is the National Committee to Review Current 
Procedures for Approval of New Drugs for Cancer and AIDS.

Home-seekers flocked to the neighborhood surrounding the Love Canal toxic-waste 
dump Wednesday as a state agency put nine houses up for sale but refused to 
guarantee their safety in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"The area's been real quiet. It'll be nice to get neighbors back," said William 
Stevenson, one of about 70 people who stayed in the neighborhood rather than 
accept a government buyout during the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists and former neighborhood residents denounced plans to 
resettle the area, which became a symbol of America's toxic waste problem when 
toxic chemical leaks drove about 2,500 people away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a very real risk," said Rebecca Todd, of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people visited the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency's sales 
office and another 10 called in the first four hours it was open, said salesman 
Len Rinallo. He said two people had already put down $100 deposits on houses 
they want to buy when the rehabilitation is finished. 
</P>
<P>
The homes are priced at $40,000 to $60,000, about 20% less than comparable 
homes elsewhere. About 250 houses in the area eventually will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Love Canal gained notoriety after 22,000 tons of dioxin, PCBs and other 
hazardous chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier by Hooker Chemical Co. began 
leaking into a middle-class neighborhood built on top of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The dump has been capped and a monitoring system installed, but most of the 
chemicals remain buried beneath a 70-acre fenced-off mound. The area chosen for 
resettlement is north and northwest of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
State studies show that the area is no more contaminated than comparable 
neighborhoods elsewhere in Niagara Falls, agency officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the safest area in the city of Niagara Falls, because we know 
the most about it," agency Executive Director William L. Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Broderick said the agency could not give any written guarantees that 
chemical leaks would not reoccur. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have is the written assurance of the state health department, the state 
environment department," he said. "If there is a problem in the future, I'm 
sure the state will come back and do as they did last time." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Ceretto, a 28-year-old substitute teacher who inspected some of the 
homes, said the lack of guarantees would not deter him from buying one.

Rebel fighters escorted staff members and refugees living in the West German, 
Moroccan and Egyptian embassies from the battleground of Monrovia Wednesday but 
refused to let Guineans evacuate their mission. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front have accused Guinea of 
supporting Liberian President Samuel K. Doe with troops. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's rebels escorted 11 West Germans, two Moroccan diplomats, the Egyptian 
ambassador, 4 Lebanese and 24 Liberians in an 18-vehicle convoy headed for 
neighboring Ivory Coast, West German Ambassador Juergen Gehl told reporters as 
he departed. 
</P>
<P>
It would take at least 12 hours to reach the northeastern border, traveling 
through rebel-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 Guineans, including the ambassador, were not allowed to join the 
convoy, Gehl said. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels attacked the embassies of Guinea and Nigeria last week, forcing more 
than 8,000 people sheltered there into the streets, where the rebels were 
battling Doe's troops with rockets, anti-aircraft guns and assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
People at Guinea's mission made their way back to the building rather than risk 
passing through numerous rebel check points blocking the route to the border. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those chased from the embassy were Mandingos, a tribe rebels accuse of 
supporting Doe's government. People suspected of aiding Doe risk summary 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's forces have captured at least four Guinean soldiers accused of 
fighting with Doe's troops. But one of the prisoners told reporters he was 
guarding the embassy when he was taken. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,400 people are still sheltered at the Nigerian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Taylor has said he would allow the Nigerian and Guinean embassies 
to evacuate their personnel. But that was before both countries announced they 
were sending troops to a six-nation West African task force mobilizing in 
neighboring Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
The West African nations sending troops are Ghana, Gambia, Guinea, Nigeria, 
Sierra Leone and Togo. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. In February, rebel commander Prince 
Johnson split with Taylor and formed a rival faction that is fighting Doe's 
soldiers in central Monrovia and fending off attacks from Taylor's forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Taylor said his rebels had killed Johnson in an ambush, but 
reporters later interviewed Johnson, who laughed at the claim.

<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to cope with East Germany's rapidly deteriorating economic 
situation, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere fired two key Cabinet ministers 
Wednesday and accepted the resignation of two others. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissals were the first for East Germany's new democratically elected 
government, and seemed certain to increase tension in the broad, four-party 
coalition charged with the task of uniting East Germany with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere announced at a press conference that he had dismissed Finance 
Minister Walter Romberg and Agricultural Minister Peter Pollack for failing to 
deal effectively with the problems involved in restructuring East Germany's 
centrally planned industrial and agricultural sectors and preparing them for 
free-market competition under monetary union with the West, which was agreed to 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl, heavily criticized for his role in failing to 
deal adequately with the declining economy, and Justice Minister Kurt Wuensche 
also left the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere said none of the four would be replaced, that their portfolios will 
be administered by subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
For Pollack, a 59-year-old independent widely regarded as inept and 
insensitive, it was an especially bad day. Hours before he was fired, he was 
shouted down and pelted with eggs and vegetables as he tried to address a 
demonstration of angry farmers in the Alexanderplatz protesting against falling 
prices and shrinking markets. 
</P>
<P>
One farmer who confronted Pollack as he tried to leave burst into tears of 
frustration and rage at the apparent lack of understanding for the plight of 
the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere's move marked the latest in a series of crises that have plagued 
his government as it staggers toward political unification with West Germany, 
probably in October. 
</P>
<P>
Serious differences over the timing of political unity, motivated mainly by 
party infighting rather than national interest, slowed government business to a 
crawl for nearly two weeks last month and threatened to destroy the coalition 
led by De Maiziere's Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Because Romberg was one of the more senior Social Democratic members of De 
Maiziere's Cabinet, the dismissals seem certain to add new strains to 
government unity. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic party chairman, Wolfgang Thierse, accused De Maiziere of 
trying to wreck the coalition. He hinted that the dismissals could jeopardize a 
treaty on political unity being negotiated by the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
"I question whether Lothar de Maiziere still wants the coalition," Thierse said 
in a televised interview. "Apparently he doesn't, and apparently he doesn't 
want a unity treaty either, because for that he needs us." 
</P>
<P>
The treaty deals with questions of finance in addition to such politically 
touchy subjects as property rights and education and cultural policy. 
</P>
<P>
Although the support of the Social Democrats is needed to approve the treaty, 
observers questioned whether the party would have the will to withstand the 
public pressure for swift unity. 
</P>
<P>
With political union now expected around the time of East German elections, 
scheduled for Oct. 14, a collapse of the coalition would further damage the 
government's image, though it would not be likely to have any long-term 
significance, observers predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The unity process calls for East Germany to accede to West Germany, a step that 
will effectively put an end to the East German government. Elections for the 
first all-German Parliament since the Nazi era are scheduled for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Cabinet dismissals are likely to put additional strain on the 
troubled coalition, political observers and many East Germans believe that they 
were necessary if the economic tailspin is to be halted. 
</P>
<P>
Figures made public Tuesday by the West German Bundesbank show that the East 
German economy declined by 9.5% in the second quarter of the year, and that the 
number of people employed in agriculture and industry declined by an additional 
7%. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp turndown in the East German economy has been widely predicted as the 
country's over-manned, antiquated industry and agriculture adjusts to the 
pressures of the free market. Economists believe that West German technical and 
financial aid will eventually generate a strong recovery. 
</P>
<P>
According to West German government sources, Romberg had consistently resisted 
pressure to reduce the bloated government payroll and had demanded subsidies of 
up to $60 billion for the five states that are to be formed in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
These sources said West Germany has offered about half that figure. They said 
that Romberg, while seeking additional funds, had failed to distribute money 
already allocated to cushion the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Pollack had departed on vacation without submitting a plan to ease the 
country's deepening agricultural crisis, which has seen farm income drop by 
about 50% this year. 
</P>
<P>
Some agricultural economists have predicted that as much as 75% of East German 
agriculture could collapse if employment is not sharply reduced, efficiency 
boosted, and product quality improved. 
</P>
<P>
Wuensche's departure was said to be unrelated to the economic crisis. A Liberal 
Democrat who served as justice minister under former Communist leader Walter 
Ulbricht, he has long been a controversial figure. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere's government suffered another setback Wednesday when Martin 
Kirchner, general secretary of the Christian Democratic Party, was suspended 
from office pending investigation of charges that he informed for the East 
German secret police over a period of 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation appeared in the West German weekly Stern.

11 DIE, 50 HURT IN DOMINICAN STRIKE CLASHES

<P>
A two-day nationwide strike over sharply higher prices led to clashes between 
police and protesters that left at least 11 people dead and 50 wounded, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The general strike virtually paralyzed this Caribbean nation of 7 million on 
Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all stores, factories and offices were closed, and public transportation 
was scarce. Normal activity resumed Wednesday, however. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-government strike, which was organized by nine major unions, led to 
violent confrontations between protesters and security forces in the capital, 
Santo Domingo, and several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the 11 people who died were all killed as a result of shots fired 
by police and soldiers to disperse unruly crowds. 
</P>
<P>
It was earlier reported that a 10-year-old girl died after being struck by a 
stone during looting, but police said Wednesday that she was accidentally hit 
by a bullet. At least 50 protesters were wounded and 2,000 arrested over the 
48-hour strike period. 
</P>
<P>
Unions organized the protest in response to an austerity program introduced 
last week by the government of President Joaquin Balaguer to shore up the 
country's faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Jose Arteaga, presidential economic adviser, said Wednesday that the 
strike would have no effect on the government's economic policies. The program 
includes sharp increases in the costs of basic consumer goods. The price of 
gasoline, for example, has risen 83.6%, from 55 cents to $1.07 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Balaguer, 83 and blind, is to be inaugurated today to a second 
consecutive four-year term. He narrowly defeated his longtime challenger, 
leftist Juan Bosch, in a disputed election May 16.

ASSEMBLY PANEL NEATLY DISPOSES OF DIAPER BILL BY KILLING IT

<P>
In politics, community groups fighting projects such as landfills and toxic 
dumps are said to be operating on the NIMBY principle -- Not in My Back Yard. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with tongue in cheek that a lobbyist for Huggies diapers this week 
suggested that opposition to a measure requiring environmental warnings on 
disposable diapers was fueled by a similar desire -- Not Until Mine Is Potty 
Trained. 
</P>
<P>
That, along with conflicting claims, led the powerful Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee on Tuesday to kill a controversial diaper bill sponsored by Sen. Lucy 
Killea (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Under Killea's proposal, companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and 
Kimberly-Clark would have been required to put stickers on packages of their 
disposables by January, 1992, saying, "Environmental warning: Single-use 
disposable diapers create significant environmental problems and costs to the 
community when disposed." 
</P>
<P>
But the committee scuttled that plan with an 8-6 vote after a heavy lobbying 
campaign from the industry, which offered economic and environmental 
counterclaims. The measure needed 12 votes to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said Wednesday she has decided to declare a public information victory 
while beating a legislative retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, the strong opposition gave us a lot more publicity on this very 
simple, innocuous bill," said Killea, adding she will not try to revive the 
bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said some parents have approached her to say they intend to switch to 
cloth diapers. It is the kind of ecologically motivated behavior that Killea 
says she wanted all along with the labels, since the non-biodegradable 
throwaways constitute about 2% of the solid wastes packed into landfills each 
year -- a volume large enough to create a 10-foot-wide strip on Interstate 5 
from Mexico to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable-diaper companies, however, said the 2% was not enough to warrant a 
label that singled out their product as an environmental hazard. "The whole 
objective is to put a user of the product on a guilt trip," said Gene Hill, 
Kimberly-Clark's regional director of state government relations. 
</P>
<P>
Killea has a second bill that would require day care centers to give parents 
the option of using either cloth or disposable diapers. That bill is still 
wending its way through the legislative process.

The state Senate has created a six-member Ethics Committee, described by 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) as "an important follow-up 
to the voter-approved Proposition 112" in the June primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 112 bans legislative speaking fees and restricts outside income of 
lawmakers. It also established an independent commission to set salaries and 
benefits for elected state officials that is expected to result in a 
legislative pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly members and senators now receive $40,816 a year and an estimated 
$18,000 in expenses, plus other lucrative fringe benefits. The yearly salary is 
already scheduled to go up to $44,898 after the November general election.

NAVY WHISTLE-BLOWERS FACE TRANSFER, PAY CUT 
</P>

Four sailors-turned-whistle-blowers on the nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz may 
no longer work on a nuclear vessel, and they face reassignment as well as a 
salary cut, Navy officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Family members, awaiting the ship's arrival here Friday, countered that the 
Navy has made scapegoats of the men instead of adequately investigating their 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors told a Seattle television station earlier this month that crew 
members aboard the Nimitz, based in Bremerton, Wash., had flouted safety 
regulations, and the four threatened to sabotage the vessel's reactors to draw 
attention to their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, Navy officials acknowledged that several sailors 
cheated on exams covering their technical knowledge of the carrier's nuclear 
reactor procedures. But they quickly added that the cheating was not widespread 
and did not endanger the ship or its crew. 
</P>
<P>
"A handful of guys admitted they looked on their buddies' test paper during one 
exam," said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman. "But the reactors are 
operating safely and the crew is well qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Because the four sailors did not use military hot lines to air their concerns 
and neglected to bring their complaints to supervising officers, the Navy lost 
confidence in the sailors and revoked the credentials that allow them to work 
on a nuclear vessel, Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
With disguised voices and obscured faces, the sailors told television station 
KIRO that crew members cheated on exams to compensate for their inadequate 
training, that faulty hardware had been installed aboard the vessel and that 
test results for radiation leaks were fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
Rima Puma, mother of one of the four, Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Steven Puma, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"Are they doing this in order to cover up their own safety inadequacies? Are 
they saying my son is unreliable? Because they did something wrong, they are 
going to try and shove it off on my son."

REMNANTS OF HURRICANE DIANA BLAMED FOR RAIN IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remnants of Hurricane Diana have been pumping warm, moist air from the Gulf of 
California to the Southwestern deserts, resulting in thundershowers, lightning 
shows and scattered rain in parts of Southern California, forecasters said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Light showers and a brief power outage were reported in Glendora and other 
parts of the San Gabriel Valley on Wednesday, but that rain was a far cry from 
the downpours and flash flooding in the Southern California desert on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flash floods occurred near Death Valley, Twentynine Palms and El Centro, and 
hail and heavy rain pelted parts of Imperial County on Tuesday, the National 
Weather Service said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
A 1,000-foot stretch of California 62 about 20 miles east of Twentynine Palms 
was covered by about eight feet of sand carried a mile down a wash by a flash 
flood, Dan Burkett, a state Department of Transportation worker, said. A 
20-mile stretch of the two-lane highway between Twentynine Palms and Parker, 
Ariz., was closed by the California Highway Patrol while heavy equipment 
removed the sand. The highway was reopened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Imperial County reported golf ball-sized hail, sheets of rain and 
fierce lightning that briefly knocked out power in some sections of El Centro 
and Raleigh on Tuesday. Local flooding hampered traffic in El Centro, 
Westmoreland and Raleigh, said El Centro police dispatcher Deborah Carmelo. 
</P>
<P>
Funnel clouds were reported near Daggett in San Bernardino County at 5:45 p.m. 
and 7:18 p.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hurricane Diana over the Gulf of Mexico moved across Mexico and took up 
residence in the Gulf of California," said Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "That's a good 
feeding ground for it, and it just spun and spun and spun."

GROUPS RENEW DEMAND THAT ELY RESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A TEACHERS UNION AND A CITIZENS GROUP CITE JAMES (TOM) ELY'S ARREST 
AND VOW TO PRESS A RECALL CAMPAIGN IF HE DOES NOT STEP DOWN AS COLLEGE TRUSTEE.

A teachers union and a Simi Valley citizens group renewed their demand 
Wednesday that Ventura County Community College District Trustee James (Tom) 
Ely give up his post, citing criminal charges filed Tuesday against him and his 
wife, Ingrid. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like him to resign," said Larry Miller, chief negotiator for the 
Ventura County Federation of Teachers, which represents 1,000 faculty members 
at Moorpark, Ventura and Oxnard colleges. "If a board member is not 
contributing anything positive to the district, then he's got to go. We have 
too many good things to do in education to be bogged down with this local 
Peyton Place drama." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ely was charged Tuesday with eight counts of embezzlement and 19 counts of 
making fraudulent claims to the district. Prosecutors say he billed the 
district for thousands of dollars in improper travel expenses incurred in 1988 
and 1989. In addition, the Elys were charged with two counts each of conspiracy 
to commit grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges is an allegation that the couple double-billed the district 
for some expenses, with Tom Ely submitting expense vouchers to the district and 
his wife submitting the expenses to the Moorpark College Alumni Assn. for 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the union will continue to support the citizens group's recall 
campaign if Ely does not resign. He said the union has already contributed 
$1,250 to the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Paras, who is coordinating the Ely recall campaign, also called for 
Ely to step down. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he will resign and take care of his own problems," Paras said. "It 
would be the best thing he could do. But knowing Tom and his ego, he probably 
won't." 
</P>
<P>
Paras said Ely's arrest will give the recall campaign an added boost. She said 
her group has gathered 3,436 of the 9,901 signatures needed to force a special 
recall election. The group has until Oct. 25 to gather the necessary 
signatures. Ely has more than a year remaining on his third four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The Elys could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Timothy Hirschberg, an outspoken critic of Ely, agreed that he should 
give up his part-time $400-a-month post. As a trustee, Ely is one of five 
people who set policy for the district, which has a $62-million budget and 
nearly 30,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
"He should resign for his own sake and the district's sake," said Hirschberg, 
who has given $100 to the recall effort. "His personal problems and financial 
problems, and now the criminal problems, have caused enough disruption to the 
board and the district." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Trustees President Greg Kampf said he is considering asking Ely to 
resign, but first he wants to review the district attorney's report and talk 
with other board members. He said that if Ely does not resign, he might lend 
his support to the recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf said Ely might no longer be an effective trustee. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his conduct on travel . . . whether he can lead or participate 
fully in the district is seriously under question," Kampf said. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf said the board will discuss whether to take any action against Ely at its 
next meeting on Sept. 4. He said the options include censure, which is a formal 
condemnation by the board for misconduct. Another option would be a lawsuit to 
try to recoup some of the money that Ely allegedly misappropriated. 
</P>
<P>
Before making any decisions, Kampf said he wants to talk with the other 
trustees and attorney Stuart W. Rudnick, who was hired by the district to 
conduct its own investigation of Ely. 
</P>
<P>
Hirschberg, however, said the board has enough information to act. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new in the charges," Hirschberg said. "The board has had the 
evidence under its noses for months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that the board has not taken a clear stand and shown that 
we're outraged," Hirschberg said. "We're responsible for a $60-million budget. 
The public must have confidence that we're not pocketing any of it." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Greg Cole could not be reached for comment. Cole has previously stated 
that Ely should resign. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Pete Tafoya said he did not wish to comment on any actions the board 
might take. "It is a very traumatic event for Mr. Ely," Tafoya said. "It 
doesn't look good for the district, and I'm obviously concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
District Chancellor Barbara Derryberry and Vice Chancellor Tom Kimberling 
declined to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, board members said they believe that the district has done all it 
can to tighten its travel policy and to ensure that similar problems do not 
occur in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new policy adopted in June, the board must approve all trips for 
individual members in advance. Previously, board members were only required to 
get approval from the chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board recently voted to establish a special committee of 
trustees Hirschberg and Tafoya to work with the community to draft an ethics 
code for the board. Among other things, the committee will reassess the need 
for providing trustees with credit cards, facsimile machines and telephones.

YOUTH SAYS GROUP LIED ABOUT DRINKING DEATH

Friends of a Thousand Oaks boy who died of alcohol poisoning during an April 
camping trip lied to police to protect the chaperons who gave the 14-year-old 
part of a bottle of whiskey and bet him he could not chug it, one of the 
teen-agers testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, whose last name was withheld during the preliminary hearing in the 
manslaughter case, said he and the other teen-agers on the camping trip at Leo 
Carrillo State Beach first told police that Leland Scovis had been given the 
whiskey by two strangers on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
They told the story to shield David Campbell, Patrick Campbell and Priscilla 
Vernon, said Bruce, who was 17 at the time of the alleged crime but has since 
turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fabricating a story so they wouldn't go to jail," Bruce said during 
testimony in the Malibu Municipal Court hearing. "Just so Dave and Priscilla 
wouldn't be put in jail for supplying the booze." 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, 29, and Patrick Campbell, 23, who are brothers, are each 
charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter, four counts of furnishing 
alcohol to a minor and four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park, is charged with being an accessory to involuntary 
manslaughter and with five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor. Vernon is the sister of one of the five boys on the trip and is engaged 
to David Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers on the trip could be charged with being accessories to 
manslaughter and with giving false information to a police officer, said Los 
Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
However, the district attorney's office will grant them immunity if they give 
truthful, full testimony, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce testified that he, Leland and three other boys arrived at the campground 
about 10 p.m. April 14. David Campbell told a ranger that he would take 
responsibility for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes later, David Campbell went to a cooler in the back of his car 
and got 12 cans of beer, which he and an unidentified man carried to the beach. 
Patrick Campbell brought a half-gallon bottle of Jim Beam whiskey, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody but Vernon drank the beer for about 15 minutes while Leland drank 
five or six shots of whiskey, boasting about how much he could drink, Bruce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Campbell then bet one of the boys on the trip $5 or $10 that Leland 
could not drink the rest of the whiskey without throwing up, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Campbell said he wanted money to pay for his bottle of 
whiskey, and one of the boys gave him $10, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon told the group that drinking was not a good idea and left. Leland then 
started drinking the whiskey remaining in the bottle, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just downed it within two minutes," said Bruce, who struggled through the 
testimony, often dabbing tears from his eyes. "He downed half of it, stopped a 
few seconds and then finished it." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, the boy lay down, lost consciousness and vomited, Bruce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Campbell continued for the next hour to stick his fingers down Leland's 
throat, clearing his airway. He also performed the Heimlich maneuver several 
times over the next hour to force Leland to vomit, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to revive Leland, Patrick Campbell suggested that they strip off 
his clothes and let the ocean water wash over him and wake him up, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Leland remained unconscious, and, at some later point, Patrick Campbell left 
the teen-agers and returned to the campsite to sleep, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell already had gone to the campsite because he had to get up early 
in the morning, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce said the boys were worried about Leland vomiting in his sleep but did not 
realize the seriousness of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one of us has ever heard that you could consume too much and die," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the boys were dragging Leland to Bruce's truck to carry him back to the 
campsite, they realized that the boy had stopped breathing, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Campbell was summoned and cleared Leland's airway, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the boys reached the campsite, Leland was again experiencing 
problems breathing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell then gave Leland mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for about five 
minutes before Leland began breathing again, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
They decided Leland needed to go to the hospital, and Bruce and two other boys 
began driving Leland in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Only 50 feet from the campsite, Bruce said, they realized that Leland would not 
survive the drive. They pulled over and called paramedics, who arrived about 15 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was taken by helicopter to Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village. 
He died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
As Bruce and two of the boys waited with David Campbell and Vernon in the 
hospital, the group began discussing the idea of lying about the night's 
events, Bruce said. David Campbell mentioned that he was afraid of going to 
jail, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, when Bruce was questioned by a deputy from the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department, he told him that two strangers walked up to the 
boys on the beach, gave them alcohol and bet Leland that he could not drink the 
whiskey, Bruce said.

SHIP LEAVES LOCAL PORT FOR DUTY IN PERSIAN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
PORT HUENEME: THE CURTISS, WHICH HAS A MERCHANT CREW, IS EQUIPPED TO REPAIR 
MARINE CORPS AIRCRAFT. TWO OTHER VESSELS LEAVE LOS ANGELES HARBOR TODAY.

<P>
A Navy ship equipped to repair Marine Corps jets and helicopters slipped out of 
Port Hueneme on Tuesday, the first of three military vessels from Southern 
California to head to the Persian Gulf since the conflict began, a Navy 
spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss, with a crew of 41 civilian merchant seamen, departed from its home 
port Tuesday afternoon, said Marge Holtz, director of public affairs for the 
Navy's Military Sealift Command in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it quiet," Holtz said. "The movements of ships are generally 
classified." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ship is berthed at the Naval Construction Battalion Center, Holtz 
said it did not depart with Seabees, the Navy's construction engineers and 
tradesmen. "There would be no reason for them to be aboard," she said. "It 
would be much easier to fly them to the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Curtiss, two huge military supply ships were scheduled to 
leave Los Angeles Harbor for the Persian Gulf at daybreak today, becoming the 
first to leave San Pedro on a voyage one anxious merchant seaman described as 
"a lot more dangerous than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Though Navy and Defense Department officials would not disclose the specific 
assignments of the vessels, Cape Ducato and Meteor, they did confirm Wednesday 
that they are slated to join the Navy's deployment in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Both vessels, cleaned and fueled in recent days at Terminal Island shipyards, 
will carry crews of about 40 merchant seamen. The ships reportedly will leave 
without military cargoes, scheduled instead to pick up equipment and supplies 
at one of several U.S. naval ports during their two- to three-week voyage to 
the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people wish they weren't going to a conflict like this," said Mark 
Kalmus, a 32-year-old merchant seaman assigned to the Cape Ducato. "Shipping 
has been slow, so everybody is glad to have a job," Kalmus said. "But this one 
could be a lot more dangerous than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Although these three ships are the first to be deployed from Southern 
California to the Middle East since the conflict began, three naval warships 
based in Long Beach and carrying about 900 sailors were already on duty in the 
region, said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser, a Navy spokesman in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss is initially headed for the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the Persian 
Gulf, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss is one of two ships deployed this week by the Navy's Military 
Sealift Command designed to repair Marine Corps aircraft damaged in the 
military's Operation Desert Shield. President Bush deployed U.S. forces to the 
Middle East after Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss' sister ship, the Wright, departed from its home port in 
Philadelphia earlier this week, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss, which measures 602 feet by 90 feet, is a floating repair shop 
outfitted with cranes and spare parts for Marine Corps aircraft. The ship is 
capable of holding 300 troops, but Holtz said it departed without any. "She is 
carrying a tremendous amount of supplies for the Marine Corps," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss is the only active-duty ship berthed at the deep-water harbor at 
Port Hueneme. The other Navy vessels docked in the harbor are retired World War 
II-vintage destroyers used for target practice by Navy jets. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the two Seabee units based at Port Hueneme were placed on alert and 
began preparing for the possibility of being dispatched to the Middle East to 
build facilities for U.S. forces deployed in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto of the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu said he 
had not heard of Navy aircraft transporting Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been flying out Seabees either," said Col. Anthony Volante of the 
Channel Islands Air National Guard Base, which maintains a squadron of 
transport planes at Point Mugu.

In the Oxnard Elementary School District -- where a group of Latino educators 
has vowed to oust a school board member they claim is insensitive -- two 
Latinos are among the seven candidates who have filed to run in the Nov. 6 
election. 
</P>
<P>
They are among 56 candidates in nine elementary and unified districts who filed 
for school board seats by the deadline Wednesday, county elections officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, three seats are open on the board, which represents a district that 
is 72% Latino. Some Oxnard residents, including challengers and the Assn. of 
Mexican-American Educators, say the board needs a Latino member. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe we need Hispanic representation," challenger Manuel R. Razo said. 
But Razo and Mary Barreto, the other Latino challenger, said that although they 
are bilingual and bicultural, they would represent all children in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The question of the board's sensitivity to Latino students was raised at a July 
meeting when board member Jack T. Fowler objected to a parent, who speaks 
English, making remarks to the board in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, members of the educators group said they would seek a 
Latino candidate to back for a board seat. But association President Sandra 
Echavarria said Wednesday that the group will not decide on whether to make 
endorsements until after an Aug. 25 meeting with the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who is seeking reelection, said Wednesday that the incident was an 
insult to the board. He said he favors an emphasis on teaching English language 
skills because success in this country is "based on the ability to read, write 
and speak the English language. If you can't do that, you're going to remain at 
the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard incumbent Dorothie J. Sterling said whether there is a Latino on the 
board is not an issue. She said the board has done a good job of representing 
all of the district's students. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents and challengers say school districts -- most feeling the financial 
crunch from Gov. George Deukmejian's recent veto of $462 million in education 
programs from the state budget -- face a broad range of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Oxnard, school board elections for elementary districts in Port Hueneme 
and Camarillo's Pleasant Valley are shaping up to be heated. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hueneme Elementary School District, where nine candidates have filed for 
three seats, challengers say their big concern is a new perspective on the 
board, where the junior member has served for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents are Elaine K. Garber, a 30-year board veteran; James K. Tipton, 
who has served on the board for 25 years, and Jose C. Babauta, a 17-year 
member. Two other board members whose terms are not up were first elected in 
1959 and 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the longevity of this board, a lot of people are interested in seeing 
some new blood," said challenger Toni Young, a Port Hueneme businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pleasant Valley district, a student population growing at the rate of 
about 150 students each year -- the result of booming development in eastern 
Camarillo -- has emerged as a campaign issue. Some parents complain that the 
schools have become crowded as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Jeanette L. (Jan) McDonald, a member of Concerned Parents for 
Neighborhood Schools, said her group is opposed to busing to solve the problem 
of crowded schools and has criticized the board for waiting too long to address 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Others among the nine challengers also said growth will be a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
But incumbent Robert W. Formhals said parents who want quick solutions to the 
space problem have an unreasonable expectation of how quickly funds can be 
obtained and how soon new schools can be built. 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates filed in three other districts, where elections will not be 
held. In two of them -- Mupu Elementary and Santa Paula Elementary -- the 
number of candidates filing was equal to the number of seats open. All five 
candidates in the two districts were incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
And in the one-school, 31-student Santa Clara Elementary School District, only 
one candidate filed for the two full-term seats available.

RESIDENTS' PETITION PROTESTS TENT JAIL

<P>
Homeowners opposed to construction of a tent jail for drug users at the Navy 
base in Port Hueneme have sent a petition with 764 signatures protesting the 
project to the base commander. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. R.J. Pearson III, commander of the Naval Construction Battalion Center, 
received the petition, spokeswoman Connie Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that the proposal is under study," she said, and a decision on 
the jail will be made in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the petition were sent to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and 
to County Supervisor John K. Flynn, said Mary Conklin, a member of the 
Concerned Citizens Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary jail was proposed by Sheriff John V. Gillespie as a way to 
provide space for as many as 320 minor drug offenders who would be housed in 
four large tents. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the County Board of Supervisors voted to ask the U.S. 
Department of Justice for $7.2 million to launch the project. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee that circulated the petition say they are concerned 
about the jail's closeness to houses and three elementary schools. GERRY BRAILO

GRANTS FOR SENIOR SERVICES UNCHANGED

<P>
The city of Oxnard will give $29,700 in grants to organizations providing 
services to local senior citizens in fiscal 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
That is the same amount budgeted for the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you go into a new year hoping to get a little more money than the last 
time," said Karen Burnham, senior services supervisor for the Oxnard Commission 
on Aging. "But in light of all those budget cuts, we felt lucky to have things 
remain status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Of the about 16 organizations that applied for grants last year, 12 received 
money, Burnham said. Money is given first to nonprofit groups that directly 
serve senior citizens, Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, grants have been used to provide legal services for the elderly; 
an ombudsman to mediate disputes, such as between a patient and a convalescent 
hospital; and home care, such as bathing and dressing, so the senior citizen 
does not have to be institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
Applications, available at the Senior Services Office at Wilson Park, must be 
postmarked by Aug. 31. Funds are expected to be distributed in November. MAJA

Moorpark teachers will elect a representative to the school board this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The school board voted Tuesday to allow a teacher representative to sit on the 
board during public meetings. The teacher will not vote but will be given the 
opportunity to discuss any item on the agenda except those related to teacher 
salary negotiations or employee relations, board members decided. 
</P>
<P>
An election will be conducted by the district to select the representative, who 
will serve on the board for a year. 
</P>

"I want to get this going as soon as possible," board member Tom Baldwin said.

SCHOOL DISTRICT TO RAISE LUNCH PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of school lunches will increase 25% in the Ocean View Elementary 
School District this fall because the schools are receiving less surplus food 
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education of the four-school Oxnard district voted Tuesday to 
raise the price from $1 to $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
June Tanaka, a past president of the Laguna Vista Elementary School Parent 
Teachers Club and a cashier in a school cafeteria, said 85% of the students at 
the school are military dependents whose parents work at the Point Hueneme 
naval base. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of those children receive free lunches or buy reduced lunches for 40 
cents, a price mandated by the state," she said. "It's unfortunate, but the 
children who can afford lunches will pay the increase." GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

A few minutes after the gates opened Wednesday on the first day of the Ventura 
County Fair, 7-year-old Chris Dunham ignored the merry-go-round and led his 
father, Jeff, and his mother, Kelly, to a face-painting booth. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the dragon," Chris said, pointing to a fierce-looking beast on the 
display board. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, Kazem (K.C.) Sangabi, painted a dragon on one of Chris' cheeks and 
a feather on the other. Then, working quickly, Sangabi decorated Jeff with a 
scorpion and Kelly with a flamingo. 
</P>
<P>
It cost the Dunhams, who live in Ventura, $9 for their nontoxic paint jobs, but 
they'd saved $2 by visiting the fair on Family Day, when children with their 
parents were admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, family groups dominated the early crowds that made their way through 
the 62 acres of exhibits and carnival rides at the County Fairgrounds in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Henrietta Tanner and her husband, Valentine Mejia, walked to the fairgrounds 
from their home on Simpson Street with Tanner's grandchildren, Leah Lozano and 
Rebecca Del Leon, both 3. 
</P>
<P>
"The kiddie rides were very nice this year, and the price was right," said 
Tanner, noting that carnival rides cost only a quarter until 1 p.m. Wednesday 
-- a bargain that was being offered again today. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner and Mejia have been visiting the County Fair every year. "Let's face it. 
It's the biggest thing that ever happens in Ventura," Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, she added, she met a young man named Leland Tanner on the midway. He 
became her first husband. She married Mejia, who grew up in Oxnard, after 
Leland died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
To Mejia, a barber at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme, 
the biggest attraction at the fair is the chance to meet old friends. "Every 
year, I run into them -- people from Ojai, Fillmore, Santa Barbara, 
everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While first-day attendance figures were not released, the line of people 
waiting to get into the fairgrounds before the 11 a.m. opening was encouraging, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nearly 1,000 people in line. That's definitely above average for 
opening day," said Devlin Raley, senior partner of Creative Images, which 
handles the fair's advertising and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The fair's new general manager, Michael Paluszak, hopes that this year's 12-day 
run exceeds last year's attendance of 306,000, but he doesn't expect it to 
surpass the record of 346,000 set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, before the crowds built up, many of the visitors were exhibitors 
checking to see how their entries had fared in the judging. 
</P>
<P>
In the Floriculture Building, 11-year-old Ian Foster of Ventura yelled, "All 
right!" when he found that he, his mother, Betty; his grandmother, Jackie 
Kelly; and his sister, Kaylyn, 4, had all won prizes for various gardening 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie has been entering the fair's gardening competition for 42 years, and 
her parents, Elliot and Beulah Stroble, were involved before her," said Barbara 
Schneider, floriculture superintendent. "In fact, 19 members of the family have 
won gardening prizes through the years." 
</P>
<P>
In the McBride Building, part of the Home Arts complex, Joe Betancourt Jr. and 
his friend, Yvette Morales, both of Oxnard, smiled proudly when they saw a 
second-place ribbon on the frame of a seascape painted by Betancourt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first competition I've ever entered," said Betancourt, who has been 
painting for four years. "I'll probably stick to seascapes. That's what I enjoy 
painting." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's grandstand show features the Pointer Sisters. Tickets for the show 
range from $12 to $18. The Stratton and Christopher country music and comedy 
show is free on the Budweiser Stage.

Police have arrested two suspects and recovered nearly all of the $50,000 in 
jewelry, clothing, cash and other goods taken Monday from a van that a woman 
and her friends were packing for a vacation trip. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives went to an apartment in the 2800 block of Mission Boulevard about 
6:30 p.m. Tuesday and found the missing jewelry, clothing, suitcases, fishing 
gear and $1,800 in cash, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are still searching for three other pieces of jewelry: a $15,000 
ring, a $3,000 ring and an $8,000 necklace. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested the resident of the apartment, Scott McEachern, 28, 
as well as Kelly Getzan, 23, of the 4000 block of Rolando Boulevard. Getzan was 
wearing clothing taken in the burglary, and a pair of stolen earrings were 
found in her car, police said. The pair were arrested on suspicion of 
possession of stolen property, and McEachern was also arrested on suspicion of 
possessing a controlled substance for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The goods were taken just after 4 a.m. Monday from the home of 52 year-old 
Charlotte Kobey as she and friends were preparing for a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the van, in the 2800 block of Oceanfront Walk, had been left 
unlocked and unattended in an unlocked garage. When Kobey and her friends came 
back after an absence of about 10 minutes, seven of eight suitcases had been 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Kobey is the wife of the late Monte Kobey, founder of Kobey's Swap Meet, who 
died in October.

The son of a San Diego evangelist who plans to buy the scandal-plagued PTL 
ministry is in County Jail on a burglary charge, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Mark Stephen Cerullo, 33, the youngest son of evangelist Morris 
Cerullo, in connection with an aborted burglary attempt at a home-improvement 
store July 29, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Cerullo was apprehended by security guards at the Home Depot store in the 
3500 block of Sports Arena Boulevard, where he allegedly posed as a store 
employee and tried to leave without paying for an air-conditioning unit, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Cerullo is charged with one count of burglary and one count of grand 
theft, said Linda Miller of the district attorney's office. He is scheduled for 
arraignment Aug. 28 in Superior Court, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Cerullo is on probation from a February, 1989, burglary conviction, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, a federal bankruptcy judge gave Morris Cerullo approval to buy the 
PTL cable network and Heritage USA theme park formerly owned by Jim Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Cerullo produced the funds needed to purchase the network, pending 
approval from the Federal Communications Commission, and has reportedly been 
trying to raise $45 million needed to buy the theme park.

The attorney for a retired San Diego police officer's son who is charged with 
murdering his grandfather with a hatchet conceded in court that the young man 
committed the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"The only issue in this case is whether it's murder or manslaughter," said 
attorney Victor Eriksen, who represents Michael Lopez, 22, of Lemon Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez is the son of Manny Lopez, a former San Diego Police sergeant who is now 
a private security consultant and was a leading character in Joseph Wambaugh's 
book "Lines and Shadows," which detailed the operations of a now-defunct 
undercover police unit aimed at fighting crime along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was Michael Lopez's maternal grandfather, Bruce Corey, 63, of Lemon 
Grove, who was found dead in his garage by his wife Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Eriksen told San Diego Superior Court jurors in his opening statement that 
Lopez was intoxicated when he went to his grandfather's home that day. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez erroneously believed that his grandfather knew he had stolen jewelry from 
his grandmother weeks earlier, Eriksen said. Lopez told Corey about the theft 
and "expected a tongue-lashing," which didn't occur. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his grandfather needed help in moving a gate to his garage and asked 
Lopez to help him, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the gate slipped and knocked Lopez to the ground, and Lopez 
"thought his grandfather was attacking him," Eriksen said. "He freaked out. He 
snapped. He reached over to the workbench and grabbed what was there. It was a 
hatchet. In a crazed frenzy, he kept hitting and hitting." Corey was struck 30 
times.

THERE'S NO FREE RIDE ON A PRIVATE TRAIN; 
</P>
<P>
SOME STICKY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIGH-SPEED LINE BETWEEN LAS VEGAS AND ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its enthusiasm this week to flag through Bechtel Corp.'s proposal to build a 
high-speed magnetic levitation rail line between Las Vegas and Anaheim, the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission left some important questions 
unanswered. The answers will have fundamental implications for the region's 
overall transportation picture. 
</P>
<P>
One place where the buck will stop down the track is the Legislature, which 
must also approve the plan. Sacramento should remember one lesson of history: 
that the public has often been asked to bail out failed private railroads in 
the past. Legislators must be very clear about how much that risk exists in the 
bullet- train project. 
</P>
<P>
And how much confidence should anyone have in the German train that Bechtel 
wants to build when it still is in the test phase? Commission Executive 
Director Paul Taylor pointed out to the unanimous commission that several 
consultants had described the Bechtel proposal as vague, lacking even a 
description of the exact state of present technology. There was even confusion 
over the cost: Bechtel said $5 billion, while Taylor's report indicated as much 
as $7.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest unknown remains the problem of public financing. Although Bechtel 
bills this as a private project, it wants rights of way along the route, and is 
already on record as saying that it might need a cash boost from benefit 
assessment districts to help cover construction costs and loan interest. So 
just how public will this private train be? 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the Palmdale-Los Angeles International Airport line, which is 
another private venture that is much clearer about its intention to tap into 
the public coffers. The Perini Corp. has indicated that it would need a public 
cash subsidy of up to $100 million a year, and the state is being asked to give 
initial approval next month to that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
One thing to watch is how the prospect of building one train might be used to 
advocate public expenditures to build another. Palmdale already is envisioned 
by Bechtel as a possible spur from the Anaheim-Las Vegas line. It wouldn't be 
too hard to argue that with some public assistance, we could have this 
elaborate network serving many points. Each step in the approval process for 
various "private" proposals could inch the public along towards a costly 
overall involvement and subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of millions of tourists riding a bullet train between Anaheim and Las 
Vegas is fine for the entrepreneurs. But let them pay for it, and let the 
public beware.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCILMAN ON LEAVE; HAS CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo City Councilman Jim Clutter has taken a 90-day leave of absence from 
the council while he undergoes chemotherapy for lymphoma, a type of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The leave, approved unanimously by the council, permits the 59-year-old 
councilman to hold office while absent from meetings. Under state law, a 
council seat is declared vacant if the council member misses all regular 
meetings for 60 consecutive days without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Clutter, a real estate salesman and retired TWA passenger service 
representative, was elected to the council in 1988. His cancer was recently 
discovered, according to city officials. The council will function with four 
members until Clutter returns.

DIGEST/LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOULD-BE ROBBER SHOT IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The manager of a Van Nuys check-cashing service shot and apparently wounded one 
of two would-be robbers Wednesday morning, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Sullivan said the shooting took place in the 12700 block of 
Sherman Way at 10 a.m. when the manager of a nearby check-cashing business 
arrived for work in a car driven by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The manager told police that a car pulled up near him and a passenger jumped 
out with a gun. Fearing that he and his wife were in danger, the manager drew 
his own gun and fired, he said. The gunman jumped back into the car without 
returning fire and it sped away, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The car, containing bloodstains indicating that an occupant was wounded, was 
found abandoned a short while later in a nearby parking lot, Sullivan said. 
Police learned that the car had been reported stolen earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the check-cashing store was not identified as a precaution and 
because police are investigating why he was carrying a handgun without a 
license, Sullivan said.

DODGERS GET SECOND WIND WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After spending nearly three months in the depths of third and fourth place, the 
Dodgers are finally seeing Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels' second game-deciding home run in five days and unflappable 
pitching by Mike Morgan gave the Dodgers a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets 
Wednesday, pulling them into a second-place tie with San Francisco in the 
National League West. 
</P>
<P>
With a 60-56 record that is identical to the Giants', it is the first time the 
Dodgers have been above third place since June 1. Even though they remained 8 
1/2 games behind first-place Cincinnati, enthusiastic clubhouse mathematicians 
agree it is easier to catch one team than two. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I've been saying, we've got to catch second place before we catch first 
place . . . and now that we've caught second place, we are going after the 
Reds," Daniels said after his three-run homer in the fourth inning against Sid 
Fernandez helped Morgan win for the second time in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
Added Rick Dempsey: "We have gotten over one barrier, now there is just one 
left. We are playing more like a pennant team. This is really getting fun." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush must have known something good was going to happen to the 
Dodgers Wednesday. He phoned Manager Tom Lasorda before the game. He and 
Lasorda are friends, and Bush just wanted to talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"One minute I'm watching Bush talking to the Pentagon on television, and the 
next minute he is on the phone in the manager's office," said a Dodger coach. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward Lasorda preferred to talk about the game, in which the Dodgers beat 
the Mets for a second consecutive time after losing in each of their first five 
meetings this year. The Mets remained in second place in the NL East, half a 
game behind Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"What a gut-wrencher," Lasorda said after the playoff-style match before 43,139 
at Shea Stadium. "This team doesn't stop believing." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got only three hits against Fernandez and Wally Whitehurst, but 
they were consecutive hits in the fourth inning -- a double by Stan Javier, a 
bunt single by Mike Sharperson and Daniels' 18th homer. Daniels, who beat 
Atlanta with a 10th-inning homer Saturday, has 59 runs batted in, five shy of 
his career high. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I was worried about this year was staying healthy," said 
Daniels, who has not been on the disabled list. "I stay healthy, I know I'll be 
hitting." 
</P>
<P>
After his homer gave the Dodgers a 3-1 lead, the Mets scored in the sixth 
inning and could have had more except Dave Magadan forgot the count and 
attempted the first steal of his career on a 3-and-0 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey threw him out, and Morgan eventually struck out Darryl Strawberry with 
a runner on first to end the inning with a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was vapor lock, it was pure stupidity, I can't believe I did it," said 
Magadan of his failed attempt. "When I came back to the bench, I felt like I 
had the plague." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan didn't feel much better in the seventh when the the Mets loaded the 
bases on a single, a pitch that hit Kelvin Torve in the foot and a walk to 
.238-hitting Tom O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, up stepped left-handed hitting Daryl Boston. Ron Perranoski, the 
Dodger pitching coach, ran to the mound. Many thought Morgan would be removed 
from the game. But Lasorda thought differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he was getting wild, he was wild low, where they couldn't hurt him 
so bad," Lasorda said. "The ball was still moving. We wanted to give him 
another hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan described the mound meeting with Perranoski as if it were a father-son 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
"Perry said, 'This is our man,' " Morgan said. "Said it just like that. Made me 
feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan dueled Boston to a full count, then, with the crowd on its feet, he 
fooled him into hitting a soft fly ball to Javier in center field. Morgan 
turned, watched Javier make the catch, then did a little hop as he slapped his 
bare hand into his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like we were in the playoffs," Morgan said. "Man, that noise level was 
awesome. That is what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was replaced in the eighth by Jim Gott, who retired the side before Jay 
Howell took over in the ninth. Howell twisted his knee while catching a one-out 
line drive by Kevin McReynolds, and allowed a two-out single to pinch- hitter 
Mark Carreon, but retired Mackey Sasser on a grounder to shortstop to end the 
game with his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
A little-used baseball rule may soon result in the recall of heralded triple-A 
shortstop Jose Offerman. Within a couple of days, when relief pitcher Mike 
Hartley recovers from his six-inning start Tuesday, the Dodgers will be 
prepared to send reliever Dave Walsh back to Albuquerque and recall an 
infielder. But Jose Vizcaino, who was demoted Aug. 11, cannot be recalled until 
Aug. 21. A demoted player must remain in the minor leagues at least 10 days. In 
Vizcaino's place, the Dodgers may choose to bring up Offerman, the Dodgers' 
future starting shortstop who is batting .331 with 59 stolen bases in 111 
games.

GWYNN GETS 1,500TH HIT; PADRES TIED IN 14TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a sharp single to center that appeared to have started a game-winning 
rally in the 12th inning Wednesday night, Tony Gwynn collected his 1,500th hit 
as a major leaguer in this, his eighth season. 
</P>
<P>
The hit proved to be only the beginning of another missed golden opportunity 
for the Padres -- on a night when there were many. 
</P>
<P>
So what does it mean for Gwynn? 
</P>
<P>
"Not a damn thing," Gwynn said before the game. "Just one more step to where I 
(eventually) want to go. I don't think it's that big of a deal myself. With 
Tempy's 2,000 hits, now that's a big deal. God willing, if I can a few more 
years, I can get to 2,000. After that, we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres and all that was left of 14,271 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
earlier thought they had a come-from-behind, extra-inning victory over the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
So on they played into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 3-3 into the 14th inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the 10th, the Padres thought they had a victory when home 
plate umpire Joe West called a balk on Expo pitcher Tim Burke with Bip Roberts 
on third. 
</P>
<P>
But the base umpires conferred and said that Burke had not balked. 
</P>
<P>
It was another one of those games the Padres and their fans have become 
accustomed to this season. The Padres again loaded the bases in the 12th, but 
the threat ended when Garry Templeton grounded out to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
From the early innings on, this one had a little bit of a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with Padre starter Bruce Hurst and relievers Greg Harris and Craig 
Lefferts, there was some good pitching, bad pitching and clutch pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst was troubled early then came on strong, retiring the 18 of the last 21 
batters he faced. Harris seemingly was in trouble throughout his three innings, 
but he escaped unscathed in the runs-against column. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Lefferts appeared shaky, but in the end, he did his job -- one 
inning, no runs. 
</P>
<P>
This game featured many threats and blown opportunities, which in a 3-3, 
14-inning effort, means a bunch of hits and men left on base. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos appeared to have Hurst on the ropes early, jumping to a 3-0 
first-inning lead and placing runners on first and third with no one out in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Otis Nixon, who was a career-best four for four Tuesday with four 
runs batted in, singled and stole second. With two outs, Tim Wallach doubled to 
right center, driving in Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
For Wallach, the National League leader in doubles, it was his 32nd and 
extended his hitting streak to 10 games. During that streak, Wallach, who was 
four for six, is 18 for 44 for a .409 average. Always tough against the Padres, 
he is 15 for 30 (.500) lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga, another hot Expo, followed Wallach with his 14th home run and 
62nd and 63rd RBIs of the year. It came on a 2-0 pitch and landed in the third 
row of seats just inside the left-field foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
Then to open the second, catcher Mike Fitzgerald walked, and Spike Owen doubled 
to right. It looked as if Hurst, who had been pitching the best he has all 
season in his last four games, might be headed for an early shower. 
</P>
<P>
But Hurst got tough. He struck out pitcher Kevin Gross. He struck out Delino 
DeShields. And he struck out Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Hurst yielded just one more hit until being lifted for a 
pinch-hitter in the bottom of the seventh. Including the three strikeouts in 
the second, Hurst retired 18 of the final 21 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst did have control problems throughout, however. Of his 104 pitches, only 
56 were strikes. By the fifth inning, he had already reached his season-high of 
four walks. In his last five starts covering 36 innings, Hurst had only five 
walks combined. He finished Wednesday with four walks and four strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The three runs scored off Hurst, who lowered his ERA to 3.57, snapped a rather 
unusual streak. Hurst had allowed just three earned runs in his last four 
starts, all of them coming on solo home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Wasting little time, the Padres battled back to tie it, 3-3, with single runs 
in the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn drove in Bip Roberts, who had singled to open the inning, with a 
sacrifice fly in the first. Benito Santiago scored on a double play in the 
second. And Gwynn drove in Roberto Alomar in the third with a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
For Alomar, his single up the middle extended his hitting streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
After going down in order in the fourth, the Padres threatened again in the 
fifth when Hurst singled to left and Roberts walked with one out. But they were 
stranded by Alomar, who struck out, and Gwynn, who lined to right. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, with Phil Stephenson on second after a single and his second 
stolen base of the year, Roberts tapped back to the mound to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth and ninth innings, it was Montreal's turn to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, on in relief of Hurst in the eighth, gave up back-to-back singles to 
right by Tim Raines and Wallach. After Galarraga flied to center, pinch-hitter 
Larry Walker walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald then lined a shot toward left that Pagliarulo somehow managed to 
snare while outstretched to his left. 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly the defensive play of the game and received the loudest ovation 
from a mostly non-vocal crowd. 
</P>
<P>
To end the inning, Harris struck out pinch-hitter Tim Foley. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, pinch-hitter Mike Aldrete singled to open the inning, but 
DeShields failed to sacrifice him to second, instead popping up to Pagliarulo. 
Harris struck out Nixon, but then Raines singled to right center, and Aldrete 
advanced to third. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Harris rose to the occasion, as Wallach flied to center. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Williams, outrighted to triple-A Las Vegas Friday to make room on the 
Padre roster for Benito Santiago, finally reported to the team Wednesday in 
Portland, according to the Stars. Williams, who cleared waivers, was scheduled 
to report Sunday when the Stars were in Tacoma but instead was deciding whether 
to become a free agent. . . . Jack Clark did not start at first base for the 
fifth consecutive game because of a sore right hamstring suffered last Thursday 
in Atlanta. Clark is listed as day-to-day. Manager Greg Riddoch said he hopes 
to have Clark back in the lineup by Friday. . . . Eric Show threw 3 1/3 shutout 
innings Tuesday after requesting a trade Sunday in Houston. Said Show before 
Wednesday's game: "I'll do my best in whatever capacity they want me to pitch 
here. Once again, I'm sorry about how all this turned out. These are things 
that have been known for a long time. None of this is new to anyone here. I'm 
not a head case. If anybody else would have been put through what I've been put 
through, they would have said the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Heading into Wednesday's game, the Padres were just 19-35 against NL East 
teams, the lowest percentage in the league. The Padres have lost 22 of their 
past 25 against the East. . . . Entering Wednesday's game, the Padres were 
28-31 at home. The Expos had the same record on the road. . . . In 1989, the 
Padres led the National League in one-run games at 30-18. This season, they are 
15-17. . . . With the 8-3 victory Tuesday, the Expos have won the opening game 
in 16 of their past 22 series. 
</P>
<P>
When Montreal's Otis Nixon singled in the first inning, it marked the 10 
consecutive time an Expo center fielder had reached base. Nixon struck out his 
second time up. Four for four with a walk and four RBIs Tuesday, Nixon hit 
safely in five consecutive at-bats. Dave Martinez, playing center field Sunday, 
was three for three with five RBIs. . . . Nixon, who homered for the first time 
in nearly five years and for only the fourth time in his six-year career 
Tuesday, went 1,807 days between home runs. . . . The Padres have hit just one 
home run (by Joe Carter) in 10 games, their longest drought of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Today's game, at 1:05, is the ninth of 10 businessman's specials. The scheduled 
pitchers are Ed Whitson (9-7) for the Padres and Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd (7-4) 
for the Expos. Whitson is second in the National League in ERA at 2.62, Boyd is 
seventh at 2.99, but just third on the Expos behind Mark Gardner (2.85) and 
Dennis Martinez (2.92). . . . General admission tickets for Saturday's T-shirt 
Night are on a reserved basis. All ticket-buyers will receive a T-shirt upon 
entering the stadium.

BASEBALL: PHILLIE IS ALMOST PERFECT AGAINST FORMER GIANT TEAMMATES, 6-0. IT 
SETS A RECORD FOR MOST NO-HITTERS IN A SEASON.

Terry Mulholland knew he had baseball history as soon as Charlie Hayes caught 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland pitched the record eighth no-hitter of the season Wednesday night as 
the Philadelphia Phillies beat the San Francisco Giants, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't realize what went through my mind when he caught that ball," 
Mulholland said. "It was such a rush of emotion. I'm not usually an emotional 
guy, but I knew the significance of that." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland knew he had just become an important part of the season of the 
no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The season's eighth no-hitter surpassed the modern record of seven set in 1908 
and tied in 1917. Mulholland's no-hitter was the first this century by a 
Phillie pitcher in Philadelphia, and also the first nine-inning no-hitter in 
the 20 seasons of Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hayes' error in the seventh inning cost Mulholland a shot at a 
perfect game. Rick Parker led off with a routine grounder that Hayes fielded 
easily at third, but he made a wide throw to first base. Parker, the only 
baserunner Mulholland allowed, was then erased on a double play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making excuses, but that throw was not that bad," Hayes said. "I think 
he (first baseman John Kruk) stretched a little early. It was not right to him, 
but I don't think I deserve an error. What the heck, I'll take the error." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kruk: "I think I should have stayed on the bag, but people who saw the 
replay told me there was no way I could have stayed on." 
</P>
<P>
Kruk, however, made a brilliant catch of a foul ball in front of the stands for 
the second out in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to catch that one if I had to buy a ticket," Kruk said. "I shouted 
the fans off, screaming, 'I got a play, I got a play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland finished the no-hitter in the ninth by retiring pinch-hitter Bill 
Bathe and Jose Uribe on grounders and getting pinch-hitter Gary Carter on a 
hard line drive that Hayes backhanded in fair territory just inside the 
third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to have Charlie over there," Mulholland said. "He makes those 
kind of plays." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland (7-6) came to the Phillies last season from the Giants in a trade 
for reliever Steve Bedrosian. He entered Wednesday's game with a 4.34 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hitters said they couldn't pick up the ball," Giant Manager Roger Craig 
said. "He was in command the whole game. He got better as the game went on, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The only other no-hitter in Veterans Stadium history was by Pascual Perez of 
Montreal on Sept. 24, 1988, a game shortened to five innings by rain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting a little bit of a jelly leg," Mulholland said. "I didn't feel 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 no-hit parade started on April 11 when the Angels' Mark Langston and 
Mike Witt combined to beat Seattle. Randy Johnson then pitched the first 
no-hitter in Seattle history, beating Detroit on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan pitched his unprecedented sixth no-hitter to beat Oakland on June 
11. Oakland's Dave Stewart and the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela made baseball 
history on June 29 by pitching no-hitters on the same day in each league. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 48 hours later, Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees pitched a 
no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on July 1 but lost, 4-0, at Comiskey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
On July 12, Melido Perez of the Chicago White Sox, the brother of Pascual, 
pitched the record-tying seventh no-hitter of the season, a rain-shortened 
six-inning victory at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland, who tossed the seventh no-hitter in Phillie history, came along 
with Hayes and pitcher Dennis Cook in the trade for Bedrosian on June 18, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland struck out eight and walked none in making baseball history against 
his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of those guys are good friends of mine," Mulholland said. "I hope they 
don't feel disgraced." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland was a compensation pick by the Giants in the June 1984 amateur draft 
for Detroit's signing Darrell Evans. He made it to the majors in 1986 and 
pitched in parts of three seasons for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 3 at Veterans Stadium, Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek pitched 8 2/3 no-hit 
innings before Sil Campusano singled. Drabek was the fifth pitcher to carry a 
no-hitter into the ninth inning this season and lose it. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first no-hitter by a Phillie since Rick Wise beat the Reds at 
Cincinnati 4-0 on June 23, 1971. The last no-hitter against the Giants was by 
Houston's Mike Scott on Sept. 25, 1986, clinching the NL West title for the 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
After Hayes made a nice stab of Carter's line drive, Mulholland flipped his 
glove in the air and was then mobbed by his teammates as the crowd went wild. 
</P>
<P>
His previous career low-hit game was a two-hitter against the Giants on Aug. 
19, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be able to show them what I can do," Mulholland said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of luck involved when you pitch a no-hitter. We hit a lot of 
balls right on the nose," Giant first baseman Will Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies made it 4-0 in the fifth off loser Don Robinson (8-4) on a one out 
single by Dickie Thon and Len Dykstra's double. Darren Daulton then hit his 
10th home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies added two runs in the sixth on RBI singles by Hayes and 
Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Giants 8 1/2 games behind first-place Cincinnati in the NL 
West.

JIM MURRAY: IN TENNIS, SHE HAS SET STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If I were to tell you one of the greatest athletes of the 20th Century -- and 
maybe the greatest of our times -- would be appearing in Manhattan Beach this 
week, would you go there expecting to see: (a) Jose Canseco, (b) the ghost of 
Jim Thorpe, (c) Nick Faldo, (d) Pete Rose, (e) Joe Montana or (f) any Detroit 
Piston? 
</P>
<P>
What you would find there is none of the above. What you would find is an 
athlete who is pound for pound, inch for inch the greatest of the era, an 
athlete who weeps in victory, smiles in defeat, wears designer clothes and 
actually looks good in earrings. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure whether God is a woman, but it just may be that the greatest 
tennis player in history is. 
</P>
<P>
Listen, when you talk of all-time sports feats, hitting in 56 consecutive 
baseball games, pitching six no-hitters, scoring 100 points in an NBA game or 
winning three Super Bowls stand out. 
</P>
<P>
But winning nine Wimbledons?! That makes the list with any of them at any time. 
</P>
<P>
It is the tennis feat of all time. It makes Martina Navratilova the best ever 
to play that game. Big Bill Tilden? He won three Wimbledons, thank you. Don 
Budge? Two Wimbledons. Rod Laver? Four Wimbledons. Bjorn Borg? Five Wimbledons. 
Ivan Lendl? None. 
</P>
<P>
You have to dip into antiquity to find a matchup for Navratilova. Only the 
elegant Helen Wills Moody, who won eight Wimbledons, is in her class. 
</P>
<P>
That's what you have to do with the truly marvelous -- measure them not against 
their contemporaries, but against their ancestors, against history. Helen Wills 
was to tennis what Babe Ruth was to baseball. Henry Aaron breaking Babe's 
all-time record was no greater an accomplishment than breaking the great Queen 
Helen's. People thought neither of them would ever be matched. 
</P>
<P>
Martina won more than a tournament. She won her way into legend. She now plays 
for the ages. She escapes the fine print. To be in the same paragraph with 
Helen Wills is an achievement. To reduce her to a footnote is to take over 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Wills used to play with the fixed expression of someone trying to win a 
pot with two treys. Martina plays with the intensity of a deer fleeing a forest 
fire, but she turns as coldly efficient as a serial killer when the Queen's cup 
is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
She is in a business where the average age seems to be somewhere between 14 and 
19 but, at 33 nearing 34, she manages to dispatch these younger, fiery 
schoolgirls with the steady competence of someone plucking chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Martina never seems to come to a game in emotional disarray. She is as tough 
and focused as Mike Tyson with his man on the ropes or Nolan Ryan with a guy 
looking for the curve. 
</P>
<P>
She dispatched a schoolgirl (Debbie Graham, Stanford) in a little over 45 
minutes Tuesday with almost bored nonchalance. It was like watching someone 
pull wings off a butterfly -- except that Martina treats every match as if it 
is a Wimbledon final. She confided afterward that she was fearful after a 
five-week layoff that she might have forgotten how to play. 
</P>
<P>
How could Martina forget how to play tennis? What does it take to win nine 
Wimbledons in the first place? What does it take to be and remain Martina 
Navratilova? 
</P>
<P>
Plenty. It calls for the tenacity of purpose of a bulldog on a rope. In Helen 
Wills' time, tennis was not exactly a profession. It was more of a pastime for 
the not-so-idle rich. Tournaments were spaced, outdoors and relentlessly 
amateur. Silver cups were at stake, not silver Rolls-Royces. 
</P>
<P>
The competition was genteel. Tennis was largely something to do before the 
cotillion started. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's Wall Street with rackets. Big bucks, high pressure. It's a jungle 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
You need your own masseuse. You need your own osteopath. You travel in an 
entourage. You're on an airplane, in a limo -- or on the court. 
</P>
<P>
You have to watch what you eat. "Your body is like a vintage Rolls-Royce," 
Martina says. "You have to be careful what fuel you put in." 
</P>
<P>
You have oatmeal and carrot juice for breakfast. Doughnuts are out. Even orange 
juice. "Sugar is a drug," Martina insists. "A mind-altering drug. It is the 
most abused drug in America. It gives you a high and then it does what all 
drugs do -- brings you down and in despair. Robs you of precious energy." 
</P>
<P>
Red meat is OK. Once a month. "I love hamburgers," Martina admits. "But if I 
ate them every time I wanted them, I wouldn't make the quarterfinals." 
</P>
<P>
The body is treated as deferentially as a sovereign. Some women check the 
mirror for their beauty. Martina checks it for her health. It is her belief 
that only her mind is 33 years old. The rest of her is still in her teens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a narcissistic life," she says. "But it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Most people wear glasses so they can see 20/20. Or even 20/30. Martina can 
already see 20/20 with the naked eye. She wears glasses because they correct 
her vision to 20/10. Martina takes every edge into the match she can muster. 
</P>
<P>
She lifts weights not to build up her muscles, but to build up her endurance. 
Martina's body is not a set of muscular knots. It's chorus-line round. 
</P>
<P>
She ices her knees after every match. She's a late sleeper. The body is 
pampered, but Martina shows little patience with the athlete in it. She is an 
expert skier, defiant of the possibility of a fracture. 
</P>
<P>
If tennis were a morality play, Martina would be the villain. She has a nice 
smile but in the early years of her career, she used it sparingly. She had come 
into the game out the gloom of Kafka's Czechoslovakia, where smiles were 
rationed like sausages. She learned to play tennis hitting a ball against a 
barn door. "It's hard to learn the game when your competition is a wall." When 
she began to beat the golden Chris Evert and everybody's darling of the center 
court, Evonne Goolagong, Martina was treated like a truck driver at a royal 
lawn party. Not anymore. Martina is the royalty on the court now. The crowds 
come to see her in the Virginia Slims tournament at Manhattan Country Club this 
week. She is an American heirloom. 
</P>
<P>
She is, typically, hardening her body and toughening her mind for the U.S. 
Open. After all, she has only won four of those. (Borg never won any). 
</P>
<P>
But her ambition is not a 10th Wimbledon or a fifth U.S. Open, it's to win a 
gold medal for the United States in the Barcelona Olympics in '92. 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting ambition. Even curious. Until you remember that Helen Wills 
won one in 1924.

MORNING BRIEFING: A WAY, A WAY, A WAY DOWN SOUR IN DIXIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Tuesday night at the Dixie Youth Baseball World Series for 11- and 12-year-olds 
in Lakeland, Fla., Winter Haven led Virginia, 7-1, going into the sixth and 
final inning. Nice cushion, except for one problem. 
</P>
<P>
John Chichetto, who had yet to bat, was on deck when Winter Haven made the 
final out in the bottom of the fifth. League rules state that all players on 
each roster must bat at least once. Violators must forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
So in the top of the sixth, Winter Haven Manager Terry Greear instructed 
pitcher Matt Sheffield to intentionally walk every Virginia batter so they 
could tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia manager eventually caught on and instructed his batters to swing 
at everything . . . but not before three runs scored, narrowing Winter Haven's 
margin of defeat to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Add forfeit: A league official told the Associated Press that this type of 
forfeit happens a number of times during the regular season, but that it was 
the first time it has happened in a World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dixie Youth Commissioner Gale Montgomery: "It's a shame that it had to 
happen. I don't like it. It's a bad situation. But what you've seen happen 
occurred strictly according to the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On this day in 1954, Sports Illustrated published its first issue. 
Name the three men pictured on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
Bicoastal guy: Dodger announcer Don Drysdale, opening the radio broadcast of 
Tuesday's doubleheader against the New York Mets at Shea Stadium: "It's a 
beautiful day here in the Big A." 
</P>
<P>
Nap time: The artificial playing surface at Washington State's Martin Stadium, 
once notoriously rock-hard, recently was replaced with a softer carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Cougar trainer Mark Smaha is elated. Last year, Smaha resorted to transporting 
dirt to a soggy practice field to avoid having to use the stadium surface, 
which he blamed for numerous injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Smaha told Bart Wright of the Tacoma Morning News Tribune: "It got to the point 
where in the last month or so of the season, the players would ask, 'Where are 
we playing today, cement or mud?' " 
</P>
<P>
Attempted piracy: According to the History of American League Baseball, in 
1950, the Pittsburgh Pirates offered the New York Yankees $500,000 and National 
League home run champion Ralph Kiner for Mickey Mantle, who had yet to play a 
major league game. 
</P>
<P>
Tragic memory: On this day in 1920, Cleveland Indian shortstop Ray Chapman was 
hit in the head with a pitch by New York's Carl Mays. Chapman suffered a 
fractured skull and died the next day -- the only on-field fatality in major 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get him wrong: Kansas City Royal pitcher Andy McGaffigan was traded by 
the Montreal Expos to San Francisco earlier this year, then was released by the 
Giants on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, McGaffigan pitched six shutout innings in the Royals' 1-0 victory over 
the Texas Rangers. As a starter, he has pitched 29 innings and given up four 
earned runs. His overall earned-run average is 1.60. 
</P>
<P>
McGaffigan told Craig Horst of the Associated Press: "I've said all along I 
thought the Giants acted prematurely. Historically, I have been a second-half 
player. I'm not saying na-na-na-na-na at the Giants, but it's a matter of fact 
that I was going to come around. I knew I would come around." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Left to right: Milwaukee Brave third baseman Eddie Mathews 
swinging, Wes Westrum of the New York Giants catching and umpire Augie 
Donatelli behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Denver Bronco Coach Dan Reeves, recovering from surgery for blocked 
arteries: "I don't feel like my job has anything to do with it and neither do 
the doctors. Although, none of us know that for sure." TED BROCK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
Arrivederci, Coop, and thanks for the thrills you gave us that made a sixth man 
No. 1 in our hearts . . . 
</P>
<P>
With every European signing, the NBA comes closer to international expansion. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers reportedly would like to trade Byron Scott and A.C. Green to the 
Indiana Pacers for Reggie Miller. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best credential new Yankee general partner Robert Nederlander brings to the job 
is a last name that isn't Steinbrenner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ken Howell was traded by the Dodgers after the 1988 season, but the stitching 
on the back of Jay Howell's jersey still identifies him as "J. Howell." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Late date: The Mets were leading the Dodgers, 1-0, in the second inning 
Wednesday on ESPN when this "update" was flashed on the bottom of the screen: 
"Los Angeles 0, New York 0, 1st inning." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rated by the Angels as can't-miss prospects in their farm system are 
24-year-old right-handed pitcher Scott Lewis with Edmonton of the Pacific Coast 
League and 21-year-old outfielder Tim Salmon with Midland of the Texas League. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
One reason Mike Scott of the Houston Astros is a losing pitcher after winning 
20 games last season is that he has added a gopher ball to his repertoire. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Royals finally are playing up to their capabilities, but their 
magic number remains 1991. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants badly need a return to form by Steve Bedrosian. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ever notice how often catchers set up with their glove as a target outside the 
strike zone? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The National League is crazy if it doesn't expand to Denver, which could draw 
as many as 3 million fans its first season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I like the one-word description of a home run by ESPN's Dan Patrick: "Gone." 
</P>
<P>
.. . 
</P>
<P>
Tim McCarver's play-by-play work on the Mets' telecasts is nearly as good as 
his commentary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is a lot kinder to brawlers than the NBA, which would have suspended 
those New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies who got off with measly fines. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' second-round draft choice, Aaron Wallace, the quick defensive end 
who set the Texas A&amp;M career sack record with 42, has three in his first 
two exhibition games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Heisman Trophy runner-up Anthony Thompson from Indiana sits out the season, 
it will be nothing new for a Cardinal draft choice. Remember Kelly Stouffer? . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
NFL games lasted an average of 3 hours 11 minutes last year. The exhibitions 
last weekend averaged 2:52. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that pro football is the only sport where most trades involve draft 
choices and rarely are player-for-player? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition football season is under way and baseball is heading into the 
stretch drive, so which Los Angeles team is having a media luncheon next 
Thursday? The Kings. Ready or not, they open camp in three weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney says he has the best running back in the nation 
in Aaron Craver, a 6-foot-1, 215-pound tailback who began his career at El 
Camino College after not playing at Compton High. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith on the speed of freshman Curtis Conway: "He runs a 4.4, 
an easy 4.4." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best view of the rising Los Angeles skyline is from the Dodger Stadium parking 
lot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but I don't think the signing of Greg Kite will turn the Orlando Magic 
around. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For the Record: Vinnie Johnson is an unrestricted free agent, meaning the 
Detroit Pistons cannot automatically keep him by matching another team's offer. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
There's an enormous difference between first and second place in the Virginia 
Slims of Los Angeles. The winner Sunday at the Manhattan Country Club will earn 
$70,000, the loser $28,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And remember when they used to play doubles merely for fun? The L.A. 
championship team will split $21,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Biggest fan at the tournament this week has been Wilt Chamberlain. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What an eventful couple of weeks for Malivai Washington, the 103rd ranked men's 
player in the world. He lost to Stefan Edberg in the first round in Los Angeles 
and then upset Ivan Lendl in the second round in New Haven, Conn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim economy won't be hurt by the Disneyland Pigskin Classic Aug. 26. 
Colorado and Tennessee each expect to bring 6,000 fans with them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation goes through with its threat to cancel 
exhibitions in the United States, few tears will be shed by NHL teams. Crowds 
were sparse for the Soviet-NHL exhibitions last season. . . .

The first annual Rolex Award goes to the NCAA for penalizing the University of 
Colorado because it signed a football recruit nine minutes too early.

SELES IS BACK IN SWING WITH NEW RACKET; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: AFTER LONG LAYOFF, SECOND-SEEDED PLAYER HAS NO TROUBLE DEFEATING 
18-YEAR-OLD KELLER IN L.A. TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since winning the French Open and reaching the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, how 
much has Monica Seles changed? 
</P>
<P>
Let's see. Her hair is lighter, her wallet is heavier and her grunt is softer. 
Other than that, nothing much is different, especially what she does on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, the 16-year-old Yugoslav who lives in Florida, won her first match since 
Wimbledon, defeating 18-year-old Audra Keller, 6-2, 6-2, Wednesday night in the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
In only 61 minutes, the second-seeded Seles won the match and proved she can be 
a little different and still produce the same result on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Seles swung her racket with two hands from both sides, as usual, only it was a 
new racket, a Yonex. For what Yonex is paying Seles -- an estimated $2.2 
million -- she would probably play with a frying pan. 
</P>
<P>
But besides the winners she deposits in the corners with it, the racket has one 
other big feature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very neat color," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though you probably couldn't see it in the dark, when the sun hits it, it 
glints, kind of like golden hair," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So you can see why she chose it. Against Keller, Seles swung hard and found 
herself engaged in slugging duel. Keller also likes to hit hard and said 
afterward that she expected more from Seles. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected her to hit harder than she did," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no shortage of power, Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I think I hit pretty hard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, whose earnings of $35,890 this year fall about $750,000 short of 
Seles', also fell short of challenging the No. 3-ranked player. Ranked No. 107, 
Keller has reached the third round once in 12 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was just the kind of match Seles wished for, after taking so 
much time off since Wimbledon. Seles served five aces, two in the eighth game 
of the second set, no double faults and won 70% of her first-serve points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always not the best to have a tough first-round opponent," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, who got her tan vacationing in Monte Carlo and her two-fisted attack 
learning the game as a pre-teen in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, is aiming to make an 
impact at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
To get ready for this year's final Grand Slam event, Seles is playing this 
week, then entering a exhibition next week in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, the U.S. Open is my main goal," she said. "I'll be ready. Tracy Austin 
proved you can do it at age 16." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce, 15, who was born in Canada, grew up in Florida and lives in 
France, lost Wednesday to Czechoslovakia's Jana Novotna, 6-4, 7-5, in a wildly 
fluctuating second-round match that had 14 service breaks in 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
Nine breaks came in the second set, which Pierce led, 3-1. Novotna, ranked No. 
14, appraised Pierce: "I think she is not a bad player, but she is quite 
inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce took the loss hard, bursting into tears. She was composed in the 
interview room and said: "The score was (good), but in another sense, I am not 
very happy because I had my chances to win. It's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
But Pierce's father, sometimes her most severe critic, praised her. 
</P>
<P>
"I kissed her on the cheek and told her she played great, and at the same time 
I told her she should have hit the backhand down the line," Jim Pierce said. 
"She got mad and walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce, ranked No. 133, is destined for greatness, her father insisted. 
"One day, she'll wake up and realize she's got everything it takes and just go 
out and do it," Jim Pierce said. "I'm waiting for that day. Then it's Katie bar 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, who asked for and accepted a wild card, had angered first-round 
opponent Andrea Temesvari by toweling off before receiving service, a delaying 
tactic that earned Pierce a warning, a point penalty and scattered boos. 
</P>
<P>
But Pierce was clearly the crowd favorite against Novotna, and her father 
remains steadfast in his belief in his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she'd be ranked just as high as (Jennifer) Capriati, but (Mary) hasn't 
gotten the 'magic draw' like she has," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if Mary played Capriati, she'd kick her butt -- maybe not, but I'd 
like to see it," he said. "You haven't seen the best of Mary yet."

Of all the sluggers in baseball's Hall of Fame, none have matched the feat that 
Mark McGwire achieved Wednesday with a grand slam in the 10th inning at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire's 400-foot-plus shot made him the first player to hit 30 or more homers 
in his first four full seasons and gave the Oakland Athletics a 6-2 victory 
over the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching (the home run ball) because I knew it was something nobody's 
ever done," said McGwire, who in his first three seasons hit 49, 32 and 33 
homers. "It's just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, who sat out Tuesday night's loss after starting 48 consecutive games, 
struck out in his first three at-bats against Boston's Dana Kiecker before 
walking in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson opened the 10th by walking as a pinch-hitter in his first 
appearance after missing seven games with a strained hamstring. After he was 
replaced by a pinch-runner, Doug Jennings reached base on a fielding error by 
shortstop Luis Rivera, and Dave Henderson was intentionally walked by reliever 
Daryl Irvine to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine threw one ball in the dirt to McGwire and was replaced by left-hander 
Rob Murphy. McGwire hit Murphy's first pitch, a fastball over the middle, for 
his fourth career grand slam, boosting his RBI total to 78 and handing Irvine 
(1-1) the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart (17-8) won his sixth consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 2, Kansas City 1 -- Bobby Witt won a team-record ninth consecutive 
decision and Gary Pettis' RBI single ended 17 scoreless innings for the Rangers 
in a win over the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Witt (12-8) struck out 11 in his fourth complete game. He has won nine of 11 
starts and has a 1.75 earned run average during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Witt took a three-hit shutout into the ninth, but Gerald Perry doubled with two 
out and scored on Jim Eisenreich's single. 
</P>
<P>
George Brett singled in the fourth inning for his 2,654th career hit, tying him 
with Ted Williams and Lafayette Cross for 50th place on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 7, Detroit 3 -- Rob Deer homered and drove in four runs to lead 
Milwaukee past the Tigers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Tom Edens went four innings in his first AL start, giving up two 
runs on five hits. Paul Mirabella (4-2) pitched 2 2/3 innings for the victory. 
Dan Plesac got one out for his 18th save. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Toronto 3 -- Sammy Shea homered and Ivan Calderon had a double, an 
RBI and scored a run to lead the White Sox over the Blue Jays at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 3-0, in the fifth, Calderon doubled, took third on a groundout and 
beat shortstop Tony Fernandez's throw home on a grounder by Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McDowell (9-6) gave up five hits in eight innings, struck out five and 
walked none. Bobby Thigpen pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 44 chances. 
</P>
<P>
John Candelaria (7-5) lost in his second start for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Minnesota 4 -- Chris James' RBI single capped a three-run rally in 
the seventh inning and Mitch Webster homered to lead the Indians past the Twins 
at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Orosco (4-4) got two outs for the victory. Doug Jones pitched two innings 
for his 32nd save. 
</P>
<P>
Relievers Tim Drummond (1-4) and Terry Leach had control problems and played a 
key role in Cleveland's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond (1-4) gave up a single and two walks to load the bases. Then Leach hit 
Carlos Baerga, forcing in a run, and Candy Maldonado followed with an RBI 
single that tied it, 4-4. James singled home the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland starter Mike Walker allowed four runs, on five hits and five walks in 
6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 2, Baltimore 0 -- Randy Johnson pitched a four-hitter and Alvin Davis 
homered and drove in the Mariners' runs at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson (11-7) pitched his second shutout and fourth complete game, striking 
out nine.

<P>
USC: DON GIBSON SUFFERED TWO MAJOR INJURIES IN EIGHT MONTHS, BUT TROJANS STILL 
EXPECT A LOT FROM HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been a year of walking gingerly for USC's Don Gibson, who lasted until 
he was in the best shape of his life and seemingly on the verge of stardom 
before suffering the first major injury of his football career . . . and then 
suffering another less than eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago this week, during the Trojans' first practice of the season in 
full gear, the nose guard caught his left leg in a pile of bodies. As he 
struggled to work it free, Gibson's teammate and practice opponent, Brad 
Leggett, drove him back over the pile. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Torn ligaments and, not counting a starting role last January in 
USC's 17-10 victory over Michigan in the Rose Bowl, the end of Gibson's 1989 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really frustrating because you put in all this hard work and it's taken 
away just like that," said Gibson, who recovered in time to make three tackles 
against Michigan and again was in superb condition last March, when he was 
moved to defensive guard in spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's new position involves him more in the pass rush, and during a 
scrimmage at the Coliseum midway through spring drills, he broke through the 
line toward quarterback Shane Foley. 
</P>
<P>
But as Gibson planted his left foot to cut, his cleats caught in the turf and 
his ankle snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson started running again only six weeks ago, but his injuries have lowered 
neither his expectations nor those of his coaches as he enters his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
USC, which has only two defensive starters back from last season, is rebuilding 
its line around Gibson, who this week pronounced himself ready for the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they say, once they take something away from you, you want it more," 
Gibson said. "I'm ready to come in and have a really good season." 
</P>
<P>
USC is counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't noticed any hesitation (in his play)," said Kevin Wolthausen, who 
coaches the Trojans' defensive linemen. "In fact, he's bigger, stronger and 
quicker now than he ever has been." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3 Gibson has increased his weight to almost 270 pounds, about 10 
more than he weighed at this time last year, in an attempt to regain the form 
that made him a starter in all 24 games of his freshman and sophomore seasons. 
</P>
<P>
No longer playing between All-American tackle Tim Ryan and All-Pacific 10 guard 
Dan Owens, who were taken in the first three rounds of the NFL draft, Gibson is 
expected to be a standout. 
</P>
<P>
As Owens' replacement at guard, he will play a more glamorous role than he had 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to focus more things around him," Wolthausen said of Gibson, who 
also will be used at nose guard occasionally, depending on the development of 
nose guards Gene Fruge, his replacement last season, and freshman Mike Hinz. 
"Before, when pass showed, he was double-teamed a lot and just kind of 
collapsed the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, instead of taking up a spot on the front and holding his ground, we 
expect him to make some more plays. We want to put him in a position where he 
(will) be single-blocked and be a little bit more productive." 
</P>
<P>
Until he was sidelined last season, Gibson was extremely productive. 
</P>
<P>
The middle son of Frank and Barbara Gibson -- his father was a three-year 
football letterman at the U.S. Military Academy and co-captain of the Cadets' 
1960 team -- Gibson was a two-way starter for three seasons at El Modena High 
in Orange, where his teams won Southern Section championships during his 
sophomore and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Recruited as a defensive lineman by USC and UCLA and as an offensive lineman by 
Stanford and Arizona, where his older brother, Boomer, was an outside 
linebacker, Gibson ultimately chose USC over Arizona because of the Trojans' 
winning tradition. 
</P>
<P>
An Army brat who was born in Atlanta and has lived in New Jersey, Kansas, New 
York, South Korea and Virginia, Gibson said: "Wherever we lived, USC was always 
on TV." 
</P>
<P>
In selecting USC, Gibson turned down a scholarship offer from Larry Smith, who 
was Arizona's coach at the time and a former teammate of Gibson's father on 
Army's freshman team. But after Gibson was redshirted as a freshman at USC, 
Smith was hired as the Trojans' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson was inserted into the starting lineup by Smith and remained there until 
last summer, earning recognition as a sophomore All-American two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And while he languished to some extent in the shadows of Ryan and Owens, "our 
team and coaches and everybody felt there wasn't much difference (among the 
three)," Wolthausen said. "We never felt he was any less of a player than those 
other guys." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, though, as he rehabilitated his knee and the Trojans led the 
nation in rushing defense without him, Gibson felt like an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, you just don't feel like you're part of the team," he said. 
"It's really hard to grasp that. You don't travel with the team. You don't go 
to meetings. It's a lot of self-discipline." 
</P>
<P>
It's also tedious, but Gibson said his spirits were buoyed almost daily by his 
younger brother, Craig, a freshman reserve center at USC, and his father, who 
had suffered a similar injury at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
And now, "as a senior, you find people looking up to you and respecting you," 
Gibson said. "People expect a lot out of you." 
</P>
<P>
But no more, it seems, than Gibson expects from himself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to specify what he described as the "lofty goals" he has set for himself 
this season, the soft-spoken Gibson said: "To play better than I ever have." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans expect no less.

BEATHARD, O'NEAL TALK, BUT NOT ABOUT DEAL

<P>
Bobby Beathard, Charger general manager, and outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal 
had a 30-minute meeting Wednesday, but talk was cheap. A new contract wasn't 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"We just sat around and talked," said O'Neal, a 20-day holdout. "I've seen him 
once before, so this is the second time we've really even talked to each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have to go out and make an extra effort so somebody can know a 
little bit about you as a person, and they can feel comfortable dealing with 
your situation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beathard: "He wasn't here to talk about his contract, he was just here to 
talk. He seems real nice. I don't know if it helps negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, who played in the Pro Bowl last season, said he thinks his agent, 
Marvin Demoff, and the Chargers are close to an agreement but said he wouldn't 
make predictions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult situation for both parties involved," O'Neal said. 
"(Beathard) really wasn't here last year to watch me play." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal sat out all of 1987 and half of 1988 with a knee injury. He played nine 
games in '88, starting one, then returned to start all 16 games last season, 
making 161 unassisted tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard is scheduled to meet with Demoff today. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Guard Mike Simmonds dislocated his kneecap in the afternoon practice on 
Wednesday and was taken from the field on a golf cart. Simmonds spent the 
second half of last season on injured reserve after dislocating his kneecap 
against the Washington Redskins on Oct. 22. "He'll be all right," Charger Coach 
Dan Henning said. "I don't think it's that serious from what the doctor said." 
. . . Henning said he would play his starters for about 50% of Saturday's 
exhibition against the Rams in Anaheim. . . . Because of injuries, Henning said 
outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith (bruised thigh) will have to be ready to 
play Saturday, but he will be kept out of the game if possible. Tight end 
Arthur Cox (strained back) is doubtful. . . . Henning said Thomas Sanders and 
Rod Bernstine will get the majority of the work at running back Saturday, with 
Ronnie Harmon and Darrin Nelson coming in on third-down situations. . . . 
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said there were no further negotiations 
on the contract of first-round draft pick Junior Seau, the linebacker from USC.

FREE AGENT FAISON UNLIKELY -- AND UNFAZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His name is Derrick Faison. You've never heard of him. He wasn't drafted, 
scouted, tested, measured or given a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
He played basketball his senior year in college, not football. When Faison did 
play football, his team ran a run-option offense. Faison was a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
But last Saturday in West Berlin, Faison caught two passes for the Rams in 
American Bowl '90. That was two more passes than were caught by starters Henry 
Ellard and Flipper Anderson. It was the first football game Faison played in 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't drop one," Faison said. "When I caught that first pass, I was kind 
of stunned for a second; you know, it was nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
One sensed the nation didn't care as much as Faison. He is this year's training 
camp puzzler, a player who somehow slipped through 12 rounds of the NFL draft 
and an ever-growing maze of scouting services and experts. 
</P>
<P>
Of the players mentioned to compete for the team's No. 4 receiver spot, 
Faison's name was never uttered. He just sort of showed up one day and took his 
place in line. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-round choice Tim Stallworth was the early-camp favorite to win the spot. 
Being a second cousin to John Stallworth, he had the right genealogy. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Lomack, a ninth-round choice, was close on Stallworth's heels. Lomack 
played for the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Faison? He was a free agent from Howard University who didn't stand a chance. 
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Faison has closed the gap enough to warrant closer inspection. 
He offers what no other Ram receiver has -- size. Faison is 6 feet 4 and 200 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
His talents are unpolished, and he's still a few great catches removed from a 
roster spot, but his course from Howard to UC Irvine has been interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Faison was deprived of his senior season at Howard when it was revealed after 
his junior year that he played too many minutes as a freshman to qualify as a 
redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in a couple games, like five seconds here, 10 seconds there, which 
cost me a whole year," Faison said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he played basketball and ran track his senior year at Howard, a 
Division I-AA school in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
When an article on his misfortune appeared in the Washington Post, Faison's 
agent mailed duplicates to all 28 NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Trump of the Rams' scouting department passed it along to Tank Younger of 
the team's administrative staff. Younger knew Faison's former coach at Howard, 
Willie Jeffries. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was worth bringing to camp," Younger said. "I got some game film 
on him, and we brought him out." 
</P>
<P>
Faison arrived on a Wednesday and told the Rams he had to be in Cleveland for a 
tryout two days later. The Browns, obviously, received the same clipping. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked out a deal," Younger said. "I felt, Cleveland, they're professionals 
too. When they see him, they're going to sign him." 
</P>
<P>
Faison said he's just trying to make the most out of his summer. He knows the 
math; there are at least three competing receivers and one open spot. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from a small school, and we ran the option," he said. "We ran a lot, so 
this is just like being in heaven. It's just real fun, because I'm getting a 
lot of footballs and I'm catching them." 
</P>
<P>
Faison said the competition among the receivers is intense but not hostile. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just pushing each other and fighting hard. We just pump each other up. 
All I wanted to do was to get in somebody's camp, just to get a look." 
</P>
<P>
Faison has done that. Whether he makes the team is another question. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stay here," Faison said. "If it doesn't work out, hopefully 
I'll be somewhere else. If not, then I can finish my last 10 hours at Howard 
(to complete a degree in business management)." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brian Smith, expected to be a key member of the Rams' inside pass rush, injured 
his left knee in afternoon practice Wednesday. Afterward, the knee was heavily 
bandaged and braced, and he left on crutches. Smith said the knee would be 
further examined today by Dr. Clarence Shields. "I hope it's only a sprain," 
Smith said. . . . Quarterback Jim Everett sat out practice with a sore back, 
the result, he said, of the long return flight from Germany on Sunday. "It's 
not a major deal," he said. Everett suffered similar back problems at the end 
of last season. "There's no change of schedule. We're just being cautious." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Stallworth, who suffered a neck strain Tuesday, was improved Wednesday but 
as a precaution, Coach John Robinson held Stallworth out of practice. "He said 
he could practice, but we're not going to let him," Robinson said. . . . 
Tailback Cleveland Gary's back problem lingers, and there is some question 
whether he'll play in Saturday's game against San Diego.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: SOVIET RIDERS BACK IN THE SADDLE -- IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gennadi Moiseev showed that Soviet motocross was competitive when he won three 
world 250cc championships in 1974, '77 and '78 and led his team to the 
Motocross des Nations world championship in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Moiseev rode a KTM, an Austrian make, but when friction developed between the 
KTM factory and the Soviet cycling federation in 1979, Soviet racing took a 
nosedive. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest in motocross has been there, and the desire, but without new 
equipment or new parts for the old equipment, there was nothing we could do," 
Moiseev said Wednesday through interpreter Anna Borjeson. 
</P>
<P>
"I won my last Grand Prix in 1979 in Bulgaria, but the trouble started right 
after that between KTM and the federation." 
</P>
<P>
Moiseev, who won 14 world championship motos, remains a national sports hero in 
the Soviet Union. When he rode in his final Grand Prix in his hometown of 
Leningrad, the event drew more than 200,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a result of glasnost and perestroika, Moiseev is in Southern California 
with two of the Soviet Union's leading riders, Viesturs Gaushis of Latvia and 
Andres Krestinov of Estonia, who are entered in the 500cc Motul U.S. Grand Prix 
of Motocross Aug. 25-26 at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. They will ride 
Hondas provided by the U. S. distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Roger DeCoster, former five-time world champion and promoter of the 500cc 
event, is also coach of the American Honda team, which includes Supercross 
champion Jeff Stanton and former multinational champion Rick Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Gaushis, a lookalike for tennis star Boris Becker, won the Soviet championship 
in 1987 but was not permitted to ride internationally because he was from 
Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
"No riders from the Baltic States were selected to ride on the Soviet national 
team the last few years," said George Mazo, who with Moiseev has formed an 
organization called Cross to promote and develop Soviet motocross, both amateur 
and professional. Moiseev is chairman of the board, Mazo the managing director. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first objective is to get some good equipment and establish a relationship 
with the Japanese manufacturers," Mazo said. "Motocross is the No. 1 sport in 
the western Soviet Union, especially the Baltic States, where there are cycle 
clubs in every little town. Most people ride a motorcycle as their 
transportation, so they enjoy racing them, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens in that region are also influenced by TV from Finland, which 
shows many European motorcycle events. There are thousands of potential racers, 
if only we could get something worth riding." 
</P>
<P>
Most Soviets ride a Czechoslovakian-made CZ, which was DeCoster's bike when he 
first began racing in his native Belgium. But the evolution of Japanese bikes 
such as Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki in the past 20 years has made the CZ 
all but obsolete in competition. The last time a non-Japanese bike won the 
500cc championship was 1974, when Heikki Mikkola of Finland rode a Husqvarna. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the race here will give our two best riders a taste of 
Grand Prix racing and start getting them ready to race the full season next 
year," Moiseev said. "We want to return the Soviet Union to the world 
championship circuit and plan to bid for a race in 1992 for Leningrad." 
</P>
<P>
Moiseev has ridden twice in the United States, in world 250cc Grand Prix events 
at Unadilla, N.Y., finishing sixth and third, but did not ride in the 500cc 
races in Carlsbad, where the world championship was contested between 1973 and 
'86. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the world has been opened up for Soviet riders, it is still 
difficult for them to travel aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Moiseev and the riders could not purchase tickets to Los Angeles because there 
was no way to do it," explained Arne Larsson, a Swedish businessman who is 
acting as liaison between Cross and American race officials and cycle 
manufacturers. "The tickets had to be purchased here and sent to them in the 
Soviet Union. Even so, they could not fly direct. It took 30 hours and four 
changes of planes, first from Moscow to Ireland, then Ireland to Cuba and Cuba 
to Mexico City and Mexico City to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Gaushis and Krestinov, both 27, will work out on new Honda bikes at the 
factory's training track in Simi Valley until next Thursday, when they will 
test the 2,030-meter track laid out by DeCoster in Glen Helen Park. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Geboers, who clinched his fifth world championship two weeks ago on his 
home course in Namur, Belgium, will head the 40-rider field. Geboers, who won 
125cc championships in 1982 and '83, the 250cc in '87 and his first 500cc in 
'88, also won the U. S. Grand Prix two years ago when it was held at Hollister, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The riders will practice on Aug. 25, with the first moto at 1 p.m. the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Shawn Moran led three U.S. riders into the World Finals when 
he won the Intercontinental Final last Sunday in Denmark. World champion Hans 
Nielsen of Denmark finished third, with U.S. riders Rick Miller fifth and 
Ronnie Correy tied for sixth. The World Finals will be on Sept. 1 at Bradford, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hicks of Riverside, who has been riding for Kings Lynn in the British 
Speedway League, returned home to ride tonight at Ascot Park's South Bay 
Stadium and Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>

Dennis Conner's hopes of becoming the defender in the 1992 America's Cup were

AFTER PUTTING BRAKES ON SKID, HEAT THINKS IT IS READY TO ROLL; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: TEAM ENTERS PLAYOFFS WITH OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDE AFTER WINNING FOUR OF 
FIVE GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
John Ajemian, the affable president of the Los Angeles Heat, was doing a brake 
job at his new Torrance gas station earlier this week when a smile crossed his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the lube room and gesturing with greasy hands, Ajemian spoke 
excitedly about the change in style and attitude that has suddenly swept over 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"The team is playing very well together now," the 31-year-old part-owner said. 
"It's all coming together, hopefully, at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Opening the American Professional Soccer League West playoffs Saturday against 
visiting Real Santa Barbara, the Heat appears to be on a roll. In second place 
in the Southern Division, the team has won four of five games going into the 
7:30 p.m. match-up at West Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, for the first time this season the Heat doesn't appear to be 
struggling to score. Los Angeles scored seven goals last weekend in wins over 
Arizona and New Mexico and was briefly in first place. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the Heat was playing in disarray and found itself in last 
place. But now, fullback Dale Ervine said, "we are communicating better and we 
are playing better." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bobby Sibbald may not be talking to the press, but many of the players 
and management personnel are. And most of them agree with Ervine. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby has hit the puzzle," said forward Brad Smith, who spent the past five 
seasons playing in Germany. "We have so many talented players. . . . Now we 
have found the picture." 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's game, the Heat will play third-place Santa Barbara again 
Monday night in Santa Barbara in the Southern Division semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
If the teams split the two games, a 30-minute mini-game will be played in Santa 
Barbara immediately after Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
If no one wins the mini-game, a penalty-kick shoot-out will decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will play a single game in Redlands on Aug. 25 against the 
California Emperors, who won the Southern Division regular-season title. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of that game will be declared Southern Division champion and will 
advance to play a home-and-home series against the Northern Division champion 
(San Francisco, Salt Lake City or Colorado). That series will be played on 
consecutive weekends, Sept. 7-9 and 14-16, to determine the APSL West champion. 
</P>
<P>
The APSL Championship Game, pitting the East champion against the West 
champion, is scheduled for Sept. 22 in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
No area of the Heat offense has felt the pressure more than the front line, 
where Smith, Bobby Bruch, Jeff Hooker, Waldir Guerra and reserve Joe Flanagan 
have traded off at forward. 
</P>
<P>
Fully one-third of the team's goals this season have been scored by players not 
on the front line. That's not uncommon at the higher levels of soccer, although 
it is the front line where American fans expect to see goals. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Hooker, an effective striker, has seen his talents go to waste. 
In several mid-season games, he and Smith appeared to move to the posts at the 
same time, out of sync. That may have changed by now. 
</P>
<P>
Said General Manager Jill Fracisco: "Jeff's the kind of guy that if he gets 
another guy that he can work with, he can be deadly. . . . It's unfortunate it 
took us a while to find that." 
</P>
<P>
Smith may be that guy. Although he demonstrated from the start that his 
experience in Germany had given him all the right moves, he was slowed by 
injuries and scored only five goals in 15 games. He spent much of his playing 
time in physical battles for the ball. Smith went nine consecutive games in 
mid-season without a score but began to click near the net about three games 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bruch was a strong point up front early in the year, but the addition of 
several highly rated players and his own mid-season scoring slump pushed him to 
the bench. He has resurfaced of late, starting several games and appearing to 
be happier off the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald's most brilliant move of the season may have been to return Guerra to 
the front line. 
</P>
<P>
The native of El Salvador, who scored 124 goals to set a national career 
scoring record at Bell High, started the season in the midfield but never felt 
comfortable there. He scored only one goal from the midfield area, though it 
was a dramatic one that spurred the Heat to a 3-2 penalty-kick victory over 
Santa Barbara in the teams' first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the ball at about midfield with the Heat trailing, 2-1, and no time 
showing on the scoreboard, Guerra charged down the far sideline with the ball 
seemingly dangling from his foot. Guerra fired from about 20 yards out and the 
ball found the back of the net to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Guerra's quick footwork, typical of Latin soccer, demonstrated that he belonged 
up front, but he, too, was slowed by injuries. In the team's fourth game he 
injured an ankle and lost his starting job in the midfield. When he resurfaced 
in the starting lineup, it was at center forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got my confidence back," Guerra said. "In the beginning I wasn't sure 
what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Guerra said he found it difficult to adapt the style of soccer he learned as a 
youth in El Salvador to that of Sibbald, an Englishman who prefers the long 
ball. In fact, Guerra became so confused a month ago that he wanted to leave 
and play for another team. 
</P>
<P>
Heat management was tipped off that Guerra had talked to the Emperors, and 
Guerra was reminded that he had a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is back at forward, Guerra has all but forgotten about quitting. 
Even better for the Heat, he, Smith and Hooker seem to be playing better and 
better together. 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "Waldir has been working well with me up front. Hooker has an eye 
for the situation to set things up." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker leads the team in points. He has six goals and five assists, tops in 
both categories. Bruch has five goals and five assists. Smith has five goals 
and a pair of assists. Guerra has one of each, as does Flanagan, the career 
scoring leader at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, defender Danny Pena is tied for the team scoring lead with six 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
The timing for the team to break out of its slump couldn't be better, Ajemian 
said, pointing out that the Heat defeated Santa Barbara in both of their 
meetings this year.

IT'S OFFICIAL: SCOTT IS LEAVING MORNINGSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: LADY MONARCH BASKETBALL COACH STARTS NEW JOB AS PART-TIME ASSISTANT 
COACH WITH THE USC WOMEN'S TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Scott has resigned as Morningside High girls' basketball coach and taken 
a job as a part-time assistant coach with the USC women's team, a USC official 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who could not be reached for comment, said last month he was "99.9% 
sure" he would make the move at the conclusion of Morningside's summer league 
season. The Lady Monarchs finished play last week. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Tessalone, USC sports information director, said Wednesday was Scott's 
first official day at his new coaching job. He will remain a full-time teacher 
at Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said last month that the assistant's position pays around $20,000 a year. 
He will work with Marianne Stanley, who is beginning her second season as USC's 
head coach. Stanley is on vacation and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
By taking the job, Scott will continue his coach-player relationship with Lisa 
Leslie, the 6-foot-5 Morningside All-American who led the Lady Monarchs to the 
last two state Division I titles. 
</P>
<P>
Scott has denied reports it was a package deal. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have said I'm getting the job because of Lisa Leslie," he said 
last month. "But (the job) was offered to me long before Lisa signed a letter 
of intent." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, selected the nation's top schoolgirl player by USA Today, picked USC 
over Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
What Scott leaves behind after 10 years as Morningside's coach is the most 
successful girls' basketball program in the history of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from capturing two state titles, his teams have won eight consecutive 
league titles, including 88 victories in a row, and four CIF-Southern Section 
major division titles, including the last three. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've done just about all I can do on the high school level," Scott 
said last month. "The USC job is going to be a challenge. I've always wanted to 
try this before. If I don't jump at this opportunity right now, I don't think I 
ever will." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said his successor will inherit a team capable of winning a third 
consecutive state title. The Lady Monarchs return four starters, led by 6-4 
junior Janet Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"The cupboard will not be left bare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Athletic Director Carl Franklin said the school will probably 
conduct interviews for a new coach later this month. 
</P>
<P>
One person who plans to apply for the job is Ron Randle, who coaches the 
Morningside boys' basketball team with Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do everything possible to get it," he said. "I'm tired of being second 
banana."

CSUN CAREER HELPS MCCLEAN IN NEW SETTING; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: DEAF NORTHRIDGE GRADUATE USES HIS COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AS SPRINGBOARD 
TO INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Deaf player makes good in volleyball. That, says Jeff McClean, is how a lot of 
people remember his varsity career at Cal State Northridge. But the emphasis is 
wrong, McClean says. He was a unique player all right -- but not because he was 
deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"The big story," says McClean, is that he had never played volleyball until the 
day he tried out for the Matadors as a freshman. "I went from knowing nothing 
and almost being cut to one of the best middle blockers in the country. Being 
deaf had nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, two years after graduation, McClean is playing international volleyball 
-- and his being deaf, ironically, has everything to do with it. He played on 
the fourth-place U.S. national team in the World Games for the Deaf last year 
in New Zealand, and this summer, he made the U.S. deaf squad that will play in 
next year's Friendship Games in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny in a way that, because I am deaf, I'm doing more (since college) 
than just playing club volleyball," said McClean, 25. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when McClean was less accepting of his impairment. At 
6-foot-5, 235 pounds, with jumping ability and strength, he figures he might 
have been a pro football player, but football is very difficult for the deaf. 
Had he not found a niche in volleyball, he might have become bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I'm at in my life, I'm finally satisfied," he says. "Everything I got 
from volleyball made up for what I lost in football." 
</P>
<P>
Another irony: Football intrigues McClean -- "Think of what players get paid in 
pro football compared with pro volleyball," he says with a smile -- but it was 
football that cost him his hearing. As a young child, McClean had hearing 
problems and his parents were cautioned that a sharp blow to the head could 
exacerbate them. "I think the doctor told my parents that it wasn't a good idea 
for me to play football," says McClean, who grew up in Woodland Hills, the 
second youngest of 10 children. 
</P>
<P>
But McClean also was encouraged to lead a normal life, so it was almost 
preordained that one day he would play a pickup football game with his buddies. 
That happened when he was 10. "Goofing around," he says, "I got popped in the 
cheek by someone's head." 
</P>
<P>
McClean sustained nerve-damage hearing loss. Today, he is completely deaf in 
his left ear and has 20% hearing in his right. A hearing aid boosts hearing in 
his right ear to 50%, enabling him to pick up most conversation. His voice 
hasn't been affected -- he speaks in a rich baritone -- and his lip-reading 
skills are excellent. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people," McClean says, "don't even realize I have a hearing problem." 
</P>
<P>
That includes CSUN volleyball Coach John Price. "I never thought of him as 
deaf," Price says. 
</P>
<P>
All Price saw that day six years ago when McClean walked in his office was an 
imposing physical specimen. "When I stopped drooling, I said, 'Yeah, you can 
try out,' " Price recalls. 
</P>
<P>
McClean had been prodded into trying out by CSUN players who spotted him 
watching a sorority volleyball game. Before that, his athletic career had 
consisted largely of one season on the sophomore basketball team at Crespi 
High. Not unexpectedly, he discovered during his first few weeks of volleyball 
practice that he "knew absolutely nothing. I was terrible. I couldn't hit, pass 
or block." 
</P>
<P>
McClean sat out his first year as a redshirt, allowing him to practice with the 
varsity. But the following year, coaches told him they didn't think he would 
make the team. "That motivated me," McClean says. "I thought this was my last 
chance to play sports." 
</P>
<P>
The necessary buttons pushed, McClean improved to the point where he was able 
to start a varsity game two months into the season. By his third year, he was a 
regular, and finished fifth in blocking in the Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. Various ailments limited his play his final season. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real good blocker in the best league in the country," Price says. "He 
was a great guy to have in the middle because he just loved to block balls." 
</P>
<P>
McClean isn't able to wear his hearing aid when he plays -- sweat kills the 
battery -- so his teammates had to make adjustments in order to communicate 
with him. "The setter would stomp his feet to get (McClean's) attention," Price 
says. "Instead of yelling where the ball is, we'd point to it in the air, which 
is probably a good thing to do anyway." 
</P>
<P>
McClean graduated CSUN as a psychology major, but a part-time job on the 
graveyard shift at The Prudential home office in Woodland Hills led to a 
permanent position with the company as a database coordinator. He works about 
55 hours a week but still has time for recreational volleyball, playing on 
grass on weekends and indoors at Sequoia Athletic Club -- Racquetball World in 
Canoga Park during the week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too slow for beach volleyball," he says, "and I like six on six better 
than two-man." 
</P>
<P>
McClean also enjoys coaching volleyball. He coached the Providence High girls' 
team for three years but had to quit because the cross-Valley drive to Burbank 
was too difficult during afternoon rush hour. He currently is looking for a 
high school coaching job closer to his home in Calabasas.

COOPER PUTS $100,000 DOWN ON SAN DIEGO'S BID FOR NHL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego became one of 10 cities to enter the chase for an NHL franchise 
Wednesday when entrepreneur Harry Cooper's application and $100,000 filing fee 
were accepted by the league office. 
</P>
<P>
Seven other American cities -- Milwaukee, Seattle, Phoenix, Houston, Tampa, St. 
Petersburg, Fla., and Miami -- and two Canadian cities -- Hamilton and Ottawa 
-- have applied. Of the $100,000 filing fee, $35,000 is non-refundable. 
</P>
<P>
Two cities will be accepted into the NHL in 1992, and each ownership group will 
pay a $50-million franchise fee. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said San Diego's chances for a team hinge on several factors: raising 
the $50 million; having a state-of-the-art arena to play in; attracting a local 
group of investors, and getting support from civic leaders and the press. 
</P>
<P>
By December, Cooper said he and his group must raise a $5-million line of 
credit. And if their application is accepted, they would have to raise another 
$22.5 million one year before beginning play. The other $22.5 million would be 
due six months before the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, co-owner of San Diego's new entry in the International Hockey League, 
said he would only be a minority owner for the new franchise. He would not 
identify the other investors or who the managing general parter might be but 
did say the ownership group will consist of a small group of local investors 
and one from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can help put this together, that will good enough for me," said Cooper, 
who put up the $100,000 application fee himself. "But I can't do it by myself." 
</P>
<P>
The NHL is expected to announce its two new teams at its winter meetings in 
December. Applications will be reviewed by a committee of the league's Board of 
Governors in the next few weeks, and a report is expected to be made to the 
full board by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the NHL has carried 21 teams, but a Bay-area team will begin play 
in 1991. Plans are in the works for the league to expand to 28 teams by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
If San Diego is accepted into the league in 1992, Cooper said the team would 
probably be called the Gulls and play initially in the Sports Arena. He said he 
hoped his proposed arena in Sorrento Hills would be ready for play in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"We would try to keep some of the (IHL) Gulls management in place," Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the NHL decides against awarding San Diego a franchise in 1992, Cooper said 
he would still be hopeful of being approved for admission later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that they will name all of the (six new franchises) in December," 
Cooper said. "That way, the cities involved could make the necessary plans." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he believes the NHL must look toward the West Coast in order to 
build rivalries and improve television revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The league needs to build on the success that Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky 
have brought to the West (with the Kings)," he said. "The league seems more 
focused on the East Coast. If they expand to San Francisco, Seattle and San 
Diego, it would give them more television revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said "the (NHL) is sold on San Diego" but that investors must buy the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important that we show the investors more than the league," he 
said. "I think we can show them early that there is a core of support." 
</P>
<P>
John Ziegler, NHL president, said he would not speculate about which cities 
might be front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to prejudge any of the applicants," he said. "Today is not the 
day. We're excited that so many cities have such confidence in the NHL and we 
want to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, Milwaukee and Phoenix are the only cities applying for a franchise 
that now have minor league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee is generally considered to be one of the stronger applicants for an 
NHL franchise. The Milwaukee Admirals play in the 2-year-old Bradley Center, 
also home of the NBA's Bucks. It is considered a state-of-the-art facility for 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler said U.S. cities did not have an advantage in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"The border is not a factor in awarding franchises," he said. "Hamilton and 
Ottawa share a great hockey tradition, and we'll analyze all factors before we 
make a decision."

Dennis Conner's America's Cup defense campaign announced Wednesday that it had 
secured Pepsi-Cola as a major sponsor for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi was a founding corporate sponsor when Conner won the America's Cup back 
from Australia in 1987 and defended it against New Zealand in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A press release from "Team Dennis Conner" said Pepsi's sponsorship had allowed 
the syndicate to begin building the first of three International America's Cup 
Class boats it is planning and that it hopes to have it ready next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Conner also announced that Alberto Calderon, a physicist who helped develop the 
innovative "twin wing" concept used by the 12-meter USA in 1987, would be 
joining the design team of David Pedrick. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Debreceny, executive director for New Zealander Michael Fay's America's 
Cup challenges in Fremantle, Australia, and San Diego, has joined the Beach 
Boys USA Syndicate as marketing adviser, the syndicate announced. 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls, San Diego's new International Hockey League franchise, announced the 
signing of two players, defenseman Pete Dineen and forward Carl Mokosak. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen, 29, will be in his 10th season of professional hockey, including time 
with the NHL's Los Angeles Kings in 1986 and the Detroit Red Wings last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mokosak entered pro hockey in 1981 with the Calgary Flames and also has spent 
time in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Boston. He played with Fort 
Wayne and Phoenix of the IHL last year, with 18 goals, 27 assists and 363 
minutes in penalties in 70 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls now have three players, including Charlie Simmer, a player/assistant 
coach.

CONSORTIUM WILL DESIGN N-REACTOR; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: FEDERAL CONTRACT IS WORTH $1.5 BILLION TO FOUR-COMPANY GROUP THAT 
INCLUDES LA JOLLA-BASED GENERAL ATOMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A four-company consortium that includes La Jolla-based General Atomics has won 
a $1.5-billion federal Department of Energy contract to design a gas-cooled 
nuclear reactor that would produce tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was one of two awarded this week by the Energy Department, which 
hopes to open a pair of "new production reactors" by 2000. The two proposed 
reactors would replace a trio of 35-year-old tritium-producing reactors in 
South Carolina that have been hampered by safety problems. The federal 
government is in the midst of a refurbishing that will keep the reactors 
operating for another decade. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at General Atomics hope the contract will provide a dramatic boost to 
the company's commercial gas-cooled nuclear energy reactor program, which has 
been dormant since interest in nuclear power began to wane in the 1970s. The 
company sees the Department of Energy contract as a means of demonstrating that 
its gas-cooled technology is much safer and more efficient than the 
water-cooled. 
</P>
<P>
Final terms of the contract have not been negotiated, but General Atomics 
officials Wednesday said about $500 million of the $1.5-billion, 10-year 
contract evidently will go to General Atomics, or to CEGA, the newly formed 
consortium that includes General Atomics; Combustion Engineering of Windsor 
Locks, Conn.; Stone Webster Engineering of Boston and Burns &amp; Roe Co. of 
Oradell, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
CEGA, which was formed last year, is at General Atomics' campus-like corporate 
headquarters in La Jolla. Employment at General Atomics has remained constant 
in recent years at about 1,400, General Atomics spokesman Doug Fouqet said 
Wednesday. However, some General Atomics employees now work for CEGA, which has 
about 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
CEGA expects to add about 200 employees during the coming year to work on the 
contract, according to Tom Johnston, a General Atomics consultant who is 
coordinating much of his company's involvement with CEGA. Some of those new 
employees will transfer to CEGA from General Atomics and other members of the 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the design work will be handled by CEGA, General Atomics will 
handle much of the front-end engineering design work. Its partners will handle 
most of the subsequent design work for the proposed plant to be built at the 
Department of Energy's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls. 
Preliminary construction costs for the plant have been set at $3.5 billion, 
Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract that was awarded Monday followed a lengthy review process that 
"ensured that the gas reactor was consistent" with the Department of Energy's 
plans to build the production reactors by 1999, department spokesman Jeff 
Judson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A second, $1.5-billion contract was awarded Monday to a consortium led by 
Dallas-based Enserch Corp., which is developing a heavy-water reactor to 
produce weapons-grade waste byproducts. The federal government hopes to develop 
both the heavy-water and gas-cooled technologies to ensure that the U.S. has an 
adequate stockpile of tritium. 
</P>
<P>
The federal contract is expected to cut the time needed to develop a 
new-generation commercial gas-cooled nuclear energy reactor because a 
significant part of the Department of Energy's proposed production reactors is 
identical to the reactor design the utility industry could use for electrical 
generation, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
"The modular design being used by the production reactor really had its start 
as a plant for our commercial nuclear power plant," Johnston said. "In most 
cases, the components would be identical. We think this would be a valid 
demonstration that (gas-cooled reactors) can do the civilian job also." 
</P>
<P>
The military version of General Atomics' proposed reactor would use highly 
enriched uranium as a fuel source in order to generate tritium, which is an 
essential component of nuclear weapons. The civilian reactors that General 
Atomics hopes to someday sell to the electric utility industry would use 
low-enriched uranium, which generates heat but is not capable of generating 
military-grade waste byproducts, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
General Atomics has long had high hopes for its gas-cooled reactor technology. 
The privately held company, which developed that technology in 1957, designed a 
now-closed demonstration plant near Philadelphia that opened in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
General Atomics subsequently designed the Ft. St. Vrain gas-cooled reactor in 
Colorado. General Atomics viewed Ft. St. Vrain, which went on line in 1979, as 
the first of many gas-cooled reactors that would be safer than water-cooled 
reactors. 
</P>
<P>
However, Public Service Co. of Colorado closed the problem-plagued reactor in 
1989 because of design flaws that forced the plant to remain off line for 
months at a time. Johnston said Wednesday that General Atomics had learned 
important design lessons from the Colorado plant that would prevent similar 
design flaws from occurring in the new generation of gas-cooled reactors. 
</P>
<P>
General Atomics officials believe that the proposed production reactor will be 
used as a demonstration plant for the utility industry and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. That dual role will occur, Johnston said, because of 
synergies between military and commercial applications. 
</P>
<P>
Using the production reactor as a demonstration plant would allow General 
Atomics to "replicate (the design) for a commercial plant in within two to five 
years," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
But, although General Atomics hopes to develop commercial applications for the 
technology used in its production reactor design, the heavy-water reactor being 
designed by the second consortium "doesn't represent a commercial challenge to 
us," Johnston said. "It operates at extremely low temperatures and it's (not 
capable of) producing steam or electricity." 
</P>
<P>
And, Johnston said, although General Atomics has secured the Department of 
Energy contract to help design the gas-cooled reactor, proponents of the 
competing light-water reactor technology "are still looking for their 
equivalent of a second- or third-generation technology . . . and have low 
levels of funding." 
</P>
<P>
The contract announced Monday followed a $10-million contract award that CEGA 
used to complete "conceptual work" on the proposed gas-cooled reactor. About $4 
million of that money flowed through to engineers at General Atomics' La Jolla 
facility, Johnston said.

SAN DIEGO / INDUSTRY NOTES: HOMEFED LAYS OFF 183 WORKERS IN WAKE OF 2ND-QUARTER 
LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
HomeFed Bank has laid off 183 employees, or 3.7% of its work force, over the 
last two weeks in efforts to trim expenses in the wake of its $108-million 
second-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan said 100 of the layoffs were a direct result of plans to 
scale back single-family loan originations. 
</P>
<P>
Another 60 of the layoffs were due to HomeFed's closing its 12-office escrow 
division and another 23 due to cutbacks in its commercial banking operation. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed would not rule out further layoffs but said none are now planned. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi said the cutbacks were linked to HomeFed's 
plan to "trim down the volume of our loan originations. . . . Instead of $6 
billion in total loan originations, it may be closer to $3 billion" next year, 
Adelizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi also said HomeFed intends to control its growth, keeping its asset 
level stable at the existing $19-billion level. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's second-quarter loss last month caused a significant reduction in its 
capital, the cushion that protects it against losses. As a result, the thrift 
announced plans to close its out-of-state loan offices, to stop making 
commercial real estate loans and to trim expenses. CHRIS KRAUL

SERVING COURSE GIVES BARTENDERS SOME ADVICE FOR A CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
ALCOHOL: ASK-L.A. TEACHES ABOUT THE ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF SERVING 
DRINKS, SUCH AS WHEN AND HOW TO SAY NO TO INTOXICATED CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANEY MILSTEAD, Milstead is a Los Angeles writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the many pastimes resurfacing from yesterday and yesteryear, cocktail 
lounging seems to be back vogue. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles neighborhood bars may be a dying breed in these times of tougher 
drunk-driving regulations, but several local restaurants report that they are 
crammed with after-work and late-evening crowds of youthful imbibers delighting 
in their first taste of low lights, tinkling pianos and heady potions that 
slipped from favor years ago when vodka became the main ingredient in 80% of 
the hard-alcohol-based beverages served commercially in America. 
</P>
<P>
As social drinking becomes trendy again and with more than one bartender 
scratching his head -- uncertain as to what actually goes into a sidecar, much 
less which seven liqueurs make up a pousse cafe and in what order -- ASK-L.A. 
couldn't have made its debut at a better moment. 
</P>
<P>
ASK-L.A. is the definitive Alcohol Server Knowledge course. Designed by the 
health and safety experts at the National Safety Council and implemented within 
the last year by 40 agencies around the country -- including the Bartender 
Training Institute in Glendale -- the course aims to educate bar and restaurant 
personnel in the art of responsible customer management, according to Al 
Lauersdorf, the council's alcohol program manager. 
</P>
<P>
The council's frightening statistics make it appear that the course hasn't 
arrived a moment too soon: About 25,000 people die and 700,000 more are injured 
in alcohol-related traffic accidents each year. Alcohol is a factor in more 
than half of all fatal motor vehicle crashes and half of all the intoxicated 
drivers on the road got that way in public drinking establishments. Add these 
numbers to our local barroom boom and the need for the safer serving of alcohol 
becomes even more urgent. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon, Utah and Florida already require that any individual involved in the 
sale of alcohol complete a server's course, and in Texas, the server is immune 
from the server's liability law if he or she takes and passes such a course. 
Chicago has just passed legislation requiring applicants for new liquor 
licenses to attend an alcohol server's program. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Carlin, owner and director of the Bartender Training Institute in 
Glendale, the only venue at which the ASK-L.A. course is available locally, 
predicts that California will soon move onto the list of concerned states 
taking action. 
</P>
<P>
"Some type of alcohol server training is likely to become mandatory nationwide 
in the not-distant future," Carlin said. "This will not be an 
alcohol-prohibitive measure, it will be alcohol management, which has become a 
must in our society. Alcohol is a social lubricant and people are always going 
to drink, but it's mind-altering and requires controls. In California, you need 
a license to cut hair or sell real estate, but as some sort of social 
pharmacist a bartender is allowed to dispense a powerful drug without ever 
being trained. 
</P>
<P>
"Responsible service is good for the public," Carlin said, "because it results 
in saved lives, and it's good for business because knowledgeable servers can 
drastically reduce the threat of liability when a customer drives away in an 
intoxicated state, and can also help lower insurance rates." 
</P>
<P>
ASK-L.A. is a five-hour, $65 course taught at the Bartender Training Institute 
by instructors certified by the National Safety Council. Servers are trained to 
recognize signs of alcohol impairment in the customer who has been in an 
establishment for an evening as well as the one who has just walked in the 
door. They also are taught methods of politely discontinuing service. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no set rules," Carlin said. "It isn't as simple as deciding that 
three drinks will make any person drunk; each individual reacts differently to 
alcohol. At what point a customer you've been serving drinks has reached his or 
her own personal limit depends on many things: whether the person has been just 
sitting or up moving around, also on whether the person has eaten during the 
evening. With a brand-new customer, you definitely need to know what to look 
for." 
</P>
<P>
An ASK-L.A. class has 10 to 15 students who also learn friendly, effective ways 
to discourage drinking and driving and who join fellow classmates in 
role-playing exercises to help find answers to "What if . . . ?" questions. 
</P>
<P>
Such interaction is contrary to yet another feature of this, the oldest 
bartending school operating in the state. At the institute, there is no such 
thing as a bartending class. All instruction is done the old-fashioned way, 
one-on-one behind the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Who goes to bartending school in times when the national salary average for 
this moveable skill is $100 a day in wages and tips? Nearly as many women as 
men of all ages attend the institute with goals ranging from a first job to a 
career change. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my students had been a mechanical engineer for 15 years and wanted a 
new direction," Carlin said. "A friend of his who owned two taverns in England 
had offered him a job if he'd learn the trade. He did and I later got a 
postcard from him; he was tending bar in London and happy as a clam." 
</P>
<P>
Scott himself is a 1975 graduate of the institute. "I was 24 years old and a 
ski bum. In October of 1974, I went up to Mammoth looking for work so I could 
spend the winter, but all I could find was one bartending job. I didn't 
qualify, so I ended up in Park City, Utah, in food services, watching the 
bartenders work nights, ski all day and make good money. When the snow melted, 
I came back to L.A. and enrolled in the institute. I went there because I'd 
heard the training was good. Little did I know I'd end up owning the place." 
</P>
<P>
After Carlin graduated, he went to work in a restaurant, but when he found 
difficulty finding bartenders for private parties, he had business cards 
printed and became a one-man free-lance operation. His bartender-for-hire 
business took off slowly but surely and he went on to form Scotty's Party 
Service, a company still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
The Bartender Training Institute began in Hawaii in 1962 with owner Ed Hanna 
bringing the business to the Mainland four years later. Carlin always kept up 
his old school ties and in 1986, when Hanna was considering retirement, Carlin 
bought the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been sorry," Carlin said. "Not about buying the school and not 
about becoming a bartender. Actually, I was just going to do it until I figured 
out what I wanted to do with my life and got a real job. I realize more and 
more, especially now that we're an agency of the National Safety Council's 
Alcohol Server Knowledge program, that this is a real job -- a real important 
one. Of course, every once in a while I think about my childhood dream of being 
a fireman. But doesn't everyone?" 
</P>
<P>
The Bartender Training Institute -- 3843 San Fernando Road, (818) 247-9968 -- 
offers a 40-hour program in beverage preparation and service and a 16-hour 
course for cocktail waiters and waitresses that teaches drink names, 
appropriate garnishes, plus how to order and serve. Courses range in price from 
$300 to $1,380 for a 100-hour course that includes bar management, checkout 
training and the ASK-L.A. seminar. 
</P>
<P>
The institute is approved as a post-secondary trade school by the State Board 
of Education; graduating students receive a certificate of completion.

BARGAINS: OFFICE SUPPLIES, NOT FOR MEMBERS ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've had many membership clubs the past few years that offer good deals after 
you pay an annual fee. But it's refreshing to come across a no-membership fee 
operation that can beat some of the major discounters. 
</P>
<P>
HQ Office Supplies Warehouse is possibly the best deal in office supplies in 
Southern California. Starting with one store in Culver City in February, 1989, 
the chain now has 12 locations in the greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an example of the savings offered there. The Thomas Los Angeles/Orange 
County Map Book (with no ZIP codes), a publication that no one in Los Angeles 
should be without, usually lists for $22.95. Crown Books' discounted price is 
$20, but HQ offers it for $12.48 -- a savings of almost 45% off list. We don't 
know of any spot in town that offers this good a deal. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best-selling word-processing programs, Word Perfect, lists for $495. 
HQ's price is $249.49, or 49% off. 
</P>
<P>
On a smaller scale, a box of 25 letter-size Pendaflex hanging folders lists for 
$13.99. Quill, a discount office supply catalogue, has a price of $8.79, but 
HQ's price is $5.06 -- a dazzling 64% off. 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged with the high cost of Dayrunners appointment books? The compact 
pocket edition in vinyl retails for $25 and is priced here at $17.86, or 28% 
off list. The 8 1/2-by-11-inch leather Entrepreneur edition lists for $175, but 
HQ's price is $125.96. The discount is even better on the vinyl Running Mate, 
which is $28.90 instead of the $40 list, and the Pocket Planner, which is 
$12.92 instead of the $20 list. If you're still into the Classic Dayrunner, 
you'll save 37% on the black leather model. Instead of $110, it's $68.96. You 
don't score as well on the refills, which are discounted from 12% to 14% for 
the Entrepreneur variety and 16% to 26% for the Classic edition. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you need a copier (Sharp or Canon), a typewriter (Smith Corona, Brother 
or Canon), an answering machine (AT&amp;T and Phonemate), file cabinets, 
banquet tables, microwaves (Emerson), coffee makers (Norelco), desk lamps or, 
of course, all kinds of paper, you'll do well with average price cuts of 30% to 
60% off list. 
</P>
<P>
There are toll-free 800 numbers for phone or fax ordering from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. For phone order service, call (800) 765-6060; the fax 
number is (800) 765-3030. The delivery charge is $15 or 5% of the purchase 
price, whichever is greater. If you place your order before noon, it will 
arrive the following day.

Yuppie Alert 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Minard, assistant manager at Irvine Ranch market in Woodland Hills, is 
wondering where all the yuppies have gone. 
</P>
<P>
When the upscale market offered to shop and deliver groceries for people -- 
such as the busy, young, upwardly mobile three-piece suits who work in Warner 
Center -- he was expecting to be inundated with fax and phone orders. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen, and Minard is puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks it's a good deal. There is no charge for the shopping, and it only 
costs $5 for the food to be delivered anywhere in the Valley. If you live 
within five miles of the market, delivery's free between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. any 
day of the week. The meat manager does the meat and poultry shopping, and the 
produce manager does the produce shopping, which means, Minard said, the 
customer gets the best of everything in the store. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, it's only been mostly older, homebound people who have taken 
advantage of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of delivery business could be because people in the Valley aren't used 
to having their shopping done for them, or delivered -- unlike their 
counterparts in Pasadena and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rocking for Cityhood 
</P>
<P>
When Malibu was raising money for cityhood, it trotted out some of its 
residents, who happened to be music or movie or television stars, and got other 
people to pay to party with them. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas, now trying to incorporate, is sort of doing that by offering up 
Toto's Bobby Kimball, Chuck Negron from Three Dog Night and the Iron 
Butterfly's Mike Pinera at the Cityhood Committee's Rock 'n' Roll fund-raiser 
Saturday at the Calabasas High School football stadium.

None of the entertainers live in, around or near Calabasas, but it's sort of 
the same idea says Bob Hill, a committee spokesman. He's confident about the 
quality of the show, but is a little nervous about the turnout. Before, when 
the Cityhood Committee was trying to fatten up the financial war chest, it just 
threw a party at the Calabasas Cantina, the funky, Wild West bar next to the 
Leonis Adobe that is the Calabasas community's answer to a Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
This time the committee went for something a little more ambitious and Hill is 
concerned that people don't know about the event. The show, which is an 
established touring group featuring 10 rock acts, has been received well by 
audiences all over the country. The concert starts at 6 p.m. Saturday, and 
tickets are $18 at the door.

</P>
<P>
All you need is a personal computer and $10 for a floppy disc called the Food 
and Food Additive Sensitivity Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The disc, which comes with some written instructions, helps you track what 
you've been biting into that may be biting back. 
</P>
<P>
You accumulate the data as outlined in the instructions, and then send the disc 
or a printout to Optimum Health Labs of Van Nuys. You get an analysis of what 
is causing your chronic recurring symptoms for which no definite allergy 
triggers have been found. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, you may have to spend less time in the company of 
your physician, who might otherwise want to do those scratch tests that look as 
if someone is playing Tic Tac Toe on your back. 
</P>
<P>
If your allergies seem mild enough to you, you might want to simply try the 
detailed meal planning guides that will keep you from eating whatever food or 
food additives that has been giving you the miseries.

This disc is the wonderwork of a Dr. Eliot Light of Positech in Monterey, who 
worked with Optimum Health Labs to develop the program.

Spirit, a 2-year-old golden retriever, and Chavez, a 2-year-old husky, were 
parked at Dr. William Gregory's Woodland Hills animal hospital for more than a 
month after their owner moved and didn't have a fenced yard at his new home. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Braverman, 25, and Lisa Zager, 26, dog groomers for Paws and Claws canine 
beauty parlor in Woodland Hills, heard about Spirit and Chavez and decided to 
become foster parents. The owner of the dogs told the Lisas that he would be 
grateful if they could keep the dogs until new homes could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Braverman took Chavez home to Calabasas, and Zager took Spirit to Woodland 
Hills. Each already has a full quota of dogs and other animals at each 
residence, so they keep asking people who come into Paws and Claws if they 
would like another pet. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming foster parents to dogs has become something of a habit for the Lisas. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago the two young women rescued two other dogs orphaned when their 
mistress died, each Lisa taking one home. New families were found for both 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lisas also helped dog trainer Judy McGraw find a home for Amber, a year-old 
Wheaton terrier, who was left behind when her owners moved. McGraw, owner of 
Your Dog 'N' You training service in Van Nuys, took the dog in and called the 
Lisas, who gussied up Amber to help her find a new home. Amber is now one of 
two Wheaton terriers who permanently reside in a Van Nuys back yard.

Size: 7.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities: Multipurpose room for disabled adults only, outdoor basketball 
court, soccer field, and children's sandlot and swings. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: Weekdays from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., weekends from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (or later 
depending on activities). 
</P>
<P>
Information: (818) 893-1931. 
</P>
<P>
To people passing by, Nordhoff Recreation Center looks like any other park in 
the San Fernando Valley. It has well-kept green grass, a children's play area 
and an outdoor basketball court on a piece of land that once was a walnut 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
But to 200 severely physically disabled adults in the Valley, the center is 
their town. Many of them spend their days at the center, where park directors 
have allowed them to elect officers and exercise their independence. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want a bunch of things that we've planned for them," said Polly 
Schuster, a recreation therapist who has been park director for nearly nine 
years. "The best thing we can give them is their independence, the social 
skills and personal skills that will allow them to one day mainstream into 
society." 
</P>
<P>
The program, which often includes outside activities chosen by the members, is 
extremely popular among disabled adults, and there is a waiting list to join 
the program, Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hate to turn people away," she said. "But this is just one of those places 
the city needs more of." 
</P>
<P>
While the ranch house is used exclusively for disabled adults, the outdoor park 
area is open to the public. KAREN KINGSBURY

TOPANGA KILLING SHATTERS FAMILY -- AND ILLUSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE SECURITIES BROKER AND HIS WIFE SEEMED A TYPICAL AFFLUENT COUPLE. 
THEN THEY ARGUED ABOUT A GATE TO THEIR YARD, AND HE SHOT HER EIGHT TIMES, 
POLICE REPORTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
David and Grace Lang had a horse called Sweet Pea, four Shetland sheep dogs, 
three children and a rose garden that was the envy of Colina Drive in Topanga 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But what happened on the night of June 4, police reports say, belied those 
trappings of upper middle-class comfort and the image of the hard-working 
father who helped pay for them. David Lang, a securities broker, emptied six 
shots into Grace Lang's body, then reloaded and fired two more shots into her 
head at point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
What touched off the slaying was deceptively mundane: where to place a gate 
outside the family's ranch-style house. But the violent act has led to 
revelations that little about the couple's 27-year relationship was as 
conventional as it seemed, including Lang's disclosure in court records that he 
and Grace were never legally married. 
</P>
<P>
The whole relationship was a bizarre one," said attorney Albert Garber, now 
defending Lang against a charge of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating the situation is a civil suit the children filed against 
their father after their mother's death. The Superior Court case seeks to 
prevent David Lang from depleting the family's assets for his criminal defense 
and to ensure that the children -- ages 22, 19 and 16 -- will have money for 
their daily needs and education. 
</P>
<P>
Garber said that the civil case is being settled and that his client has no 
intention of leaving his children without money. The children are living with 
relatives and have had no contact with their father since their mother was 
killed, Garber said, although Lang, who is being held in Los Angeles County 
Jail, would love to see them. 
</P>
<P>
Why someone of Lang's success and lack of a criminal record would resort to 
such violence is a question many who knew the couple are asking, and one 
expected to be the focus of a preliminary hearing Aug. 24 in Malibu Municipal 
Court. Lang, 47, has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"He is in the process of being examined by a psychiatrist to answer the 
question of why a man of such intelligence and no element of violence would 
shoot the woman he loved," Garber said. He said the former broker for Dean 
Witter Reynolds Inc., who earned at least $100,000 a year, killed in 
self-defense after years of abuse from a woman who drank and threatened him 
with knives. 
</P>
<P>
But police reports and friends of Grace Lang portray David Lang as the troubled 
spouse, describing him as a driven, controlling man whose final act of rage 
against his 46-year-old common-law wife was set off when she moved a gate 
without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
Court records indicate that the couple had been bickering over the gate most of 
the weekend of June 2 and 3, and continued the argument Monday night, June 4. 
</P>
<P>
"When the suspect saw what had been done on Saturday morning with the gate, he 
became enraged because it was done without his permission," said a report by 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim accused him of being a 'dictator' in his own house," the report 
continues, citing Lang's own description of the argument after his arrest. He 
also told investigators he had been "deeply in love" with Grace since 1963, 
their reports said. 
</P>
<P>
But the couple "had not gotten along for several years," their 16-year-old 
daughter told investigators, adding that "her father is very abusive both 
physically and mentally toward her mother." 
</P>
<P>
The daughter was awakened by the 11:30 p.m. shooting and her mother's cries for 
help, police reports said. She ran to neighbors who phoned for emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors on Colina Drive -- where residents greet each other on horseback and 
along the trails of Topanga State Park -- declined to discuss the Langs as a 
couple. But they described Grace Lang as a gentle, friendly woman who hiked 
daily and took pride in her garden. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a hiker, a mother and a happy person," close friend Esperanza Riskin 
said. "She had a beautiful garden filled with roses, lots of roses. She had the 
prettiest garden in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Riskin said Grace Lang had a college degree in anthropology but never used it. 
Most recently, she had worked as a secretary in a Woodland Hills pharmaceutical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very generous, warm, good person, and I think this was a horrible, 
horrible act," Riskin said. Of Lang's allegations that it was Grace who was 
abusive -- drinking and wielding knives -- Riskin vehemently denied the 
characterization, saying, "That's not her." 
</P>
<P>
John Walsh, Grace Lang's employer at the Boots Co. Inc., remembered her as a 
warm, efficient woman and said he found David Lang's allegations that she was a 
knife-wielding threat hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
She was clearly devoted to her children, Walsh recalled. The boys checked in by 
phone regularly, and she would pick up her daughter from high school each 
afternoon and bring her back to the office until it was time to go home, Walsh 
said. "You could see they had a strong bond," Walsh said, adding, "I just saw 
her as really the one who was holding the family together." 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Lang, 19, said in an interview that his mother was "really close to all 
three of us even though each us of were different." Of his father, Adrian said: 
"He wasn't even a father when he was here. He was just like the businessman who 
came home and barked at everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Lang was a father under pressure to pay for his children's schooling, cars and 
trips to Europe, his attorney said. Lang has been fired from Dean Witter since 
his arrest, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lang also supported a fourth child from a previous marriage, Garber said. The 
son, now 22, was born within a month of when Grace Lang gave birth to the 
couple's oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
David Lang disclosed in court records that after his sons were born in the 
spring of 1968, while he was still legally married but involved with Grace, "it 
became impossible me to maintain two separate residences, one with my legal 
wife . . . and the other with Grace." 
</P>
<P>
So Grace Lang and the baby moved in with Lang, his wife and the other baby, 
"and we all lived together for a period of time," his statement said. 
</P>
<P>
David and Grace, whose last name was Lujan, never married because "we mutually 
had the same opinion that no marriage was necessary," Lang said in his court 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
A former biology teacher, Lang changed careers to support his family, his 
attorney said. He loved to read and the den where Lang kept his handgun also 
contained 10,000 books, Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
Lang appeared to be under constant pressure to succeed in business, according 
to colleagues and clients -- several of whom wrote letters to Municipal Judge 
Lawrence J. Mira on Lang's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"Something horrible had to have happened to him for him to have resorted to 
such a thing," Lynn James, a client of Lang for eight years, said in an 
interview. "It was just the biggest shock in my life when I heard the news." 
</P>
<P>
James praised Lang's sound investment advice, availability and patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time I had a question, no matter how stupid it was, he'd take the time to 
answer it and explain it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Levy, who worked with Lang for several years at a now-defunct bond 
brokerage, similarly described Lang as a diligent municipal bonds broker who 
worked 12-hour days, often skipping lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the men worked together at night, Levy said, and Lang had confided 
that his marriage was strained over how to discipline the teen-agers. Lang 
favored a stricter approach while his common-law wife was more liberal, Levy 
and Garber said. "I feel as though David is innocent in this situation and it's 
only because I feel there was a lot of pressure brought on him through whatever 
was going on," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
But another former colleague, securities broker Steven Siskin, recalled Lang as 
an extremely high-strung man with a reputation for confrontation. Lang could be 
overheard speaking harshly to his children on the phone, said Siskin, and he 
was known around the office for disagreements set off by seemingly petty 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
In one such confrontation, Siskin said, Lang provoked a third broker into a 
shouting match after repeatedly turning over or pushing aside the other man's 
family photographs on a shared filing cabinet. In another instance, Lang became 
angry when his birthdate was added to a list of office birthdays without his 
permission, Siskin said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to find a situation not all black on one side and not all white 
on the other," attorney Garber said. "It's a tragedy. There's no justification 
for it, but there may be an explanation of how it could reach that level."

CITIES LOBBY REP. ANDERSON TO FIGHT COSTLY FLOOD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in this time of drought, Southeast and Long Beach officials accept the 
idea that a "100-year flood" could wash over the concrete banks of the Los 
Angeles and Rio Hondo rivers and cause millions of dollars in damage to their 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
But they say they cannot accept a federal agency's plan that would require many 
new buildings to be elevated and insured against catastrophic flood at 
considerable expense. 
</P>
<P>
The officials met Monday with Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) to seek help 
in staving off the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be some legislative relief, otherwise we're going to be hurting 
economically," Pico Rivera Mayor Alberto Natividad said during Monday's meeting 
at Downey City Hall. "We would have to build on stilts." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is the focus of the consternation. The 
agency is revising flood maps in accordance with recent information that 
indicates that there is a greater danger of flooding than previously thought 
along the two rivers. 
</P>
<P>
If the maps are published as planned in September, 1992, local governments 
would then have to ensure that new houses and buildings are constructed above 
the waterline of a 100-year flood. Protection also would be required as part of 
any substantial improvements planned for existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
During such a flood, waters averaging about four feet deep would spread over 
most of an 82-square-mile plain, affecting 16 cities in the Southeast, Long 
Beach and South Bay areas, according to federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, flood insurance would be required for many new and substantially 
remodeled buildings in the flood plain. FEMA oversees the National Flood 
Insurance Program, which provides the vast majority of flood insurance through 
private carriers across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, most property owners in the affected areas are not required to have 
flood insurance because the area is not considered to be at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
Flood insurance on a home purchased with a $185,000 loan would range from about 
$240 to $530 a year, depending on the risk identified in the new maps. That 
rate is as much as twice the current cost, agency spokesman Michael Shore said. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders said the new maps would trigger severe financial hardship for 
homeowners and developers that outweighs concerns about damages from a 100-year 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the new maps could create a "catastrophic problem before the 
flood comes," Bellflower Mayor Randy Bomgaars warned. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Bell Gardens, Carson, Compton, Downey, Long Beach, 
Lynwood, Montebello, Paramount and South Gate also spoke against releasing the 
maps. Downey officials organized the meeting to lobby Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hourlong meeting, Anderson said he would try to meet with 
other area congressmen to come up with a solution to the cities' potential 
flooding problems. That includes a $327-million proposal by the Army Corps of 
Engineers to improve the Los Angeles and Rio Hondo riverbeds to eliminate the 
chance of major flooding. 
</P>
<P>
But that project has not yet been approved by Congress and is at least 10 years 
from being completed, said Jon Sweeten, assistant project manager for the Army 
Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
While Anderson was sympathetic to the city leaders, he made no promises. He 
emphasized that a devastating flood is always a possibility, even if Southern 
California is in the midst of a severe drought, and precautions should be taken 
as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get hit by a big flood . . . what happens?" Anderson said. "We've got to 
try to work it out the best we can." Anderson's 32nd District stretches from 
San Pedro north to Downey. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers in 1987 announced that the Southeast, Long Beach 
and South Bay areas need more protection from a 100-year flood than previously 
thought. Such a flood has a 1% chance of occurring each year and a 65% chance 
of occurring every 100 years. One has not struck Los Angeles County this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Army engineers say such a flood could occur in Los Angeles County in a storm 
that would dump 10 inches of rain over a 24-hour period, including one deluge 
of six inches in a six-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Long Beach was just one storm away from a 100-year flood after six 
consecutive storms pushed waters to the top of the Los Angeles River channel, 
engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
A 100-year flood would blanket 82 square miles and cause $2.25 billion in 
damage to 120,000 buildings. The homes of about 500,000 people would be 
damaged, an agency spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers estimates the waters would be two to eight feet deep 
throughout the plain. 
</P>
<P>
The cities in the flood plain are Bellflower, Bell Gardens, Carson, Cerritos, 
Compton, Downey, Gardena, Lakewood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Lynwood, 
Montebello, Paramount, Pico Rivera, Signal Hill, South Gate and Torrance. 
Unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County and a section of downtown Los 
Angeles are also included. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the damage would be in communities that straddle the lower Los 
Angeles River and the Rio Hondo south of the Whittier Narrows Dam, federal 
engineers have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
City officials told Anderson that Congress should hold the federal agency at 
bay to allow the Corps of Engineers to complete its project, which would 
eliminate the threat of flood. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a major waste," Long Beach Councilman Evan Anderson Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the corps' plan, levees along the two rivers, which now are between 20 
and 25 feet high, would be raised an average of three to five feet. The plan 
also calls for raising 27 bridges to accommodate the higher channel and shoring 
up existing levees where they are weakest.

DESCANSO IS GETTING A NEW LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
RENOVATION: A WATERFALL, AN EXPANDED LAKE AND A PEDESTRIAN PATH ARE IN THE 
WORKS FOR THE GARDENS IN LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To the average observer, a new waterfall at Descanso Gardens appears to be a 
natural rock formation with water cascading down from a lake just above. 
</P>
<P>
But the waterfall is actually a sophisticated construction project: The water 
recirculates through a plumbing system separate from the lake, and 140 tons of 
artificial rock made out of concrete is wedged inconspicuously among 120 tons 
of genuine granite boulders. 
</P>
<P>
Granite boulders aren't always the right size or shape, project supervisor Bill 
Beggs said, and some of them would have been too heavy to place in precarious 
positions near the falls. 
</P>
<P>
So workers from Anaheim-based Rock Formations built concrete rock casings into 
the hillside as well as a number of artificial boulders to achieve the look 
that Glendale architects Larry Moss &amp; Associates wanted, Rock Formations 
owner Bruce Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial rocks were treated with paint to make them look natural, and a 
treated substance called "soil cement" makes the bottom of the falls look 
natural, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the falls marks the halfway point of a $350,000 lake renovation 
project funded mainly by the Descanso Gardens Guild. Descanso also received a 
$70,000 grant from Los Angeles County for the project, guild President Gail 
Boatwright said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is still under way on the second part of the project, the large 
lake at the top of the falls, Beggs said. The lake, designed to be a bird 
sanctuary, is scheduled for completion in November, before the bird migration 
season, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two smaller lakes were combined to create the 1.5-acre lake, he said. It will 
feature tiny islands where birds can nest and marshes where they can hide from 
predators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyotes have preyed upon birds in the past, killing many nestlings, he said. 
More than 130 varieties of birds frequent the gardens in La Canada Flintridge, 
according to a checklist prepared by the county Department of Arboreta and 
Botanic Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The main county arboretum in Arcadia is donating tule, or long reeds, to 
landscape the edges of the lake, Boatwright said. Native California plants, 
Australian shrubs and two large willows will also border the new lake, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the project is complete, visitors will be able to follow a path that will 
wrap around the lake and extend over the waterfall, he said.

HATHAWAY TO REOPEN FOR FAMILIES; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLAND PARK: PLANS CALL FOR THE FORMER CHILDREN'S HOME TO OFFER COUNSELING, 
DAY CARE AND OTHER SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME AREA RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two years after closing its Highland Park home for troubled children, Hathaway 
Children's Services is planning to reopen the estate early next year as a 
daytime resource center for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed center would house a Head Start program, family counseling 
services, a nurse to provide basic medical care and eventually a day-care 
center for infants and toddlers, Hathaway President Brian Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency closed the 71-year-old children's home in September, 1988, after 
Cahill convinced the board of directors that several dormitories had 
deteriorated to the point that they were not good places for children to live. 
</P>
<P>
The large house anchoring the seven-building, three-acre estate had significant 
historical value and needed only superficial repairs, but the four smaller 
dormitories behind it would have been too costly to rehabilitate, Cahill said. 
When it closed the home, the board intended to eventually develop some kind of 
non-residential child-care center on that site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway officials formed the idea of a family resource center in large part 
because of the results of an informal survey Councilman Richard Alatorre's 
office conducted in the Highland Park community, Cahill said. In the survey, 
residents cited what kinds of services they felt they needed the most. 
</P>
<P>
Low-cost day care, children's programs and basic, family-oriented health care 
topped the list, said Jeanmarie Hance-Murphy, Alatorre's planning deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway officials concluded that their agency could provide these things for 
$600,000 less per year than it had cost them to operate their residential 
program in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It just kind of clicked," Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan for the property relieved many Highland Park residents who were 
concerned at first that Hathaway might sell the estate to a developer, said 
Charles Fisher, chairman of the Highland Park Neighborhood Assn. Residents 
persuaded the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1989 to declare the 
main house a historical monument to save it from such a threat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The main house, sheltered by the boughs of a towering white zupote tree at 840 
N. Avenue 66, was built in 1905. Its architect, Robert E. Williams, was one of 
two architects associated with the Arroyo Guild of Craftsmen, a 
turn-of-the-century group that advocated handcrafted work over mass-produced 
designs. The estate has been used as a children's home since 1919. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway's request for a conditional-use permit for the new center will be 
considered at a City Planning Commission hearing scheduled for Sept. 14, Cahill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering firm of Psomas &amp; Associates surveyed the property and found 
that its proposed use would have no adverse effects on the surrounding 
environment. Hathaway plans to raze two former dormitories to build a parking 
lot so that patrons' cars would not take up the street, Cahill said. Two others 
may be razed and replaced with portable classroom buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, residents have not voiced concerns about increased traffic, Fisher 
said. An apartment building or other development would have brought in more 
traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hathaway has a very good reputation in the area," Fisher said. "If there were 
an outside group coming in, there would be a lot more suspicion. But people are 
familiar with Hathaway, and they know what kind of services it provides." 
</P>
<P>
The agency is asking private foundations and corporations for the $150,000 
needed for renovations, Cahill said. It has not yet found a major backer, said 
Gail Guglielmino, Hathaway's director of development. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the federally funded Head Start program, the new center's 
programs would be 100% privately funded at first, Cahill said. Operational 
costs for the first year are estimated at $400,000 and would include the 
salaries of seven staff members. 
</P>
<P>
A day-care center, which is in the second phase of Hathaway's new plan for the 
site, probably would not open until 1992, Cahill said. Hathaway will try to get 
some state funding for it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the agency's residential center in Sylmar, where children are placed 
after demonstrating severe emotional or family problems, the proposed Highland 
Park center would stress early intervention in families that could be 
susceptible to such problems later on, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
Children at the Sylmar facility often have been separated from their families 
by the courts, and about 40% of them are never returned to their families, he 
said. At the new center, strengthening family units would be a key goal, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Johnson, director of the Head Start program at Options, a social service 
agency in Highland Park, said she hopes to nail down plans to open a Head Start 
program at the Hathaway facility within 60 days. The Options Head Start program 
oversees 10 Head Start centers in Northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Congress recently passed two bills that will provide Head Start with funding to 
expand its programs, and Hathaway's Highland Park estate is a desirable site, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson toured the estate recently with Lyn Kubosa-Munro, Hathaway's director 
of community services, and said she was very enthusiastic when she saw the 
facility already had a playground, an open asphalt area, a swimming pool, 
basketball courts, an arts-and-crafts workshop and a huge classroom building. 
</P>
<P>
"The things we usually put in the centers already exist there," she said. 
Johnson also was pleased that the classroom buildings had adequate numbers of 
toilets and sinks, and sufficient square footage -- "those ticky-tacky little 
things that determine whether you get a license," she said. Any agency offering 
child care services must meet licensing requirements set by the state 
Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
Kubosa-Munro said the new center will seek to establish a close relationship 
with the community by hiring a Highland Park resident to act as a liaison 
between families and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway counselors also sometimes will go to residents' homes, she said. And 
because Hathaway is located at the far north end of the area it plans to serve, 
Hathaway officials hope to use a van to pick up families who need 
transportation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also will hire a counselor to serve as a liaison between Hathaway 
and local elementary schools. The school liaison would refer to Hathaway 
children who show signs of developing significant emotional or family problems, 
Kubosa-Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
Head Start staff also will assess the needs of children and families in their 
program and sometimes refer them to the medical or family counseling services 
that also will be offered at the Hathaway site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn Shapiro, principal of Aldama Elementary School on North Avenue 50, said 
the predominately Hispanic, low-income families who send their children to 
Aldama could really use these kinds of services. 
</P>
<P>
"Our particular school community doesn't have access to those kinds of services 
nearby," she said. "Frequently those kids have to go to a county office or 
faraway agency, those kinds of distances. Transportation is always a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway counselors also would help residents learn how to use various 
resources in their community, from before-school care programs to supermarkets 
-- which often are intimidating for immigrants, Kubosa-Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to assist families in being empowered to deal with their own 
problems," Cahill said.

RTD BOARD APPROVES EXPANSION OF SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District have approved 
expansion of Glendale's free Beeline bus shuttle service into south Glendale 
for at least six months. The service, expected to begin Oct. 1, will loop 
through the southern part of the city along Brand Boulevard and Central Avenue, 
with a stop at the city's Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials had protested expansion of the city's shuttle, saying that it 
would divert riders from RTD buses that travel the same route. As a condition 
of its approval Aug. 9, the RTD board ordered ridership surveys to measure the 
shuttle's impact on bus revenues. 
</P>
<P>
If the shuttle diverts a significant number of riders, the RTD and city will 
consider route changes, financial compensation or other mitigation measures. If 
there is no major change in bus ridership, the shuttle will be allowed to 
continue operating beyond the six-month limit.

<P>
COCKTAIL BAR LOSES PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council on Monday unanimously upheld a decision by the city's 
Committee on Permits and Licenses to revoke the cocktail bar permit of the 
Cover Girl Lounge at 9300 Jefferson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which went into effect immediately, followed a two-hour, 
court-style appeals hearing during which City Prosecutor Jonathan Horne alleged 
that the lounge: 
</P>
<P>
* Was the subject of more than 70 police service calls, a "veritable shopping 
list of disorderly-person activities," including a shoot-out in the parking 
lot, between mid-1988 and January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowed distribution of advertising flyers at Beverly Hills and Culver City 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
* Established a practice of admitting and serving alcohol to people under the 
legal drinking age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Police Sgt. Hank Davies testified that as recently as July 27, more 
than two months after the committee initially voted to revoke the club's 
permit, he and his partner investigated a complaint and found that six of the 
30 people in the club were underage. 
</P>
<P>
"In every instance I've been at the Cover Girl Lounge, minors have been 
drinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Jerry H. Green, representing owner Earl Williams, said the 
violations were "isolated and intermittent," occurring no more often than in 
any other club in Los Angeles County. He called Davies' testimony a smear 
against the club. 
</P>
<P>
Green said he and Williams, who plans to sell the club, may appeal the decision 
in Superior Court.

PLANNER APPOINTED TO FILL LATE COUNCILMAN'S TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council unanimously selected Amat Barcelon to serve the remaining two 
years of the council term of Larry Sandoval, who recently died of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
The council could have called a special election to fill Sandoval's seat. 
</P>
<P>
But as in similar instances in the past, it opted Monday night to appoint a 
replacement. Sandoval first became a council member when he was appointed to 
succeed Councilman Armando Mora, who died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
A 38-year resident of Santa Fe Springs, Barcelon has been a member of the 
Planning Commission since 1986 and is chairman of the Heritage Artwork in 
Public Places Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Barcelon, 64, retired from Rockwell International Corp. four years ago after a 
27-year career, during which he worked as a contract and operations 
administrator. A World War II infantry veteran, Barcelon was wounded in April, 
1945, and received a medical discharge in 1946. He and his wife of 38 years 
have two grown daughters and a grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Barcelon graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management in 1951 from 
Woodbury College in Los Angeles.

COUNCIL ALLOWS RENOVATION TO CONTINUE AT HISTORIC CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council agreed Tuesday to allow earthquake reinforcement work 
and other renovation to continue at a historic church but withheld final 
approval on a controversial wall that was erected around the church. 
</P>
<P>
The council ordered the directors of St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church, 500 
S. Central Ave., to work with the city's Historic Preservation Commission on a 
plan to modify or remove portions of the perimeter walls that were erected 
without review by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials have complained that the wall's design is not compatible 
with the historic site. 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders told the council Tuesday that the wall was built after city 
staff members told them that no special permit was required. 
</P>
<P>
The building was constructed in 1926 as the First Church of Christ, Scientist 
using a Roman-Classical design. In 1977, city officials designated it as a 
historic landmark. Such sites cannot be altered without a review by the 
Historic Preservation Commission and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledged that a building permit was issued by mistake 
earlier this year to allow seismic reinforcement of the church building. 
Renovation was halted after the error was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached with the council, church leaders must replace 
certain signs, install a bronze historic plaque and preserve 10 windows that 
were to be filled in as part of the reinforcement work.

BEST BETS: NO 'STUFFY' SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's billed as a symphony that won't be on the "stuffy" side, and it takes 
place Saturday evening in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo Arts Council will present Woolf Philips, director of the 
Camarillo Symphony, in a free concert of music from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's program, titled "Harmony Around the World," starts out in the 
Grand Canyon and ends up on the River Kwai. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the program will be music by Giuseppe Verdi and Ferde Grofe, and 
original compositions by Philips, including his overture from "Childrens' Fairy 
Tales." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what you'd call a stuffy concert," Philips said. "It's something 
everybody should enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
The symphony, with more than 60 musicians, made its debut last year at a 
Camarillo Arts Council free concert to an audience of more than 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will begin at 6 p.m. Saturday in Constitution Park, next to 
Camarillo City Hall, 601 N. Carmen Drive. It will be free. 
</P>
<P>
"People can bring a picnic, tea, lunch or whatever, and find a spot under a 
tree, and they'll be quite happy," Philips said. 
</P>
<P>
For information, call the Camarillo Arts Council Arts Hot Line at 987-7847.

12% CUT IN WATER USE CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has announced that its water conservation program has resulted in a 
12% reduction in water usage. 
</P>
<P>
The figure is below the 15% goal set by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
A mandatory conservation program instituted by the city this year has uncovered 
272 cases in which gardeners or residents exceeded water consumption levels. 
City officials said more than 50% of those cases involved over-spraying of 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The city's conservation figure was equal to the mark cited by 300 cities and 
unincorporated communities served by the Metropolitan Water District. The city 
of Los Angeles reported a 15.5% savings in June.

The city, which spends $2.5 million each year maintaining its famed tree-lined 
streets, will soon start work on a tree-trimming program involving nearly 600 
ficus and callistemon trees. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Finance Department has recommended approval of a $73,000 bid from a 
private contractor for the work. A lower bid was rejected after it was 
determined that the tree-trimmer did not have a license, according to city 
officials.

Photo, Here's Lookin' at You, Tom Sawyer: Old-fashioned, down-on-the-farm fun 
for city kids was provided at Heritage Park in Santa Fe Springs. It was 
Children's Day last Saturday, and there were country games for various age 
groups, puppet shows in the carriage barn, a pie-eating contest, scavenger hunt 
and balloons for everyone. In the Tom Sawyer look-alike contest, Aaron Force, 
4, above, was all freckles for the part but had a sudden attack of shyness just 
before the judging and left the stage to join his mother. At left, Amy Peverley 
feeds goats that were restrained by cages -- otherwise they might have nibbled 
at the polka dots on her dress. Other performers in the petting zoo were 
chickens, a cow and llama. Children also had an opportunity to wash clothes on 
a scrub board, have their picture taken in old-fashioned clothes or pump water 
from a well at the park that features historical displays and is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. ; Photo, SARAH M. BROWN / For The Times

6-MONTH FREEZE WILL LIMIT BUILDINGS TO TWO STORIES

<P>
After nearly three hours of emotional debate Tuesday, the City Council approved 
an emergency six-month moratorium on development aimed at controlling 
overcrowding and crime in the waterfront district. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze will immediately affect only a small portion of the city's 2nd 
District. However, supporters and critics said the action challenges the 
foundation of the city's redevelopment policy. Some city officials and 
community activists also expressed fear that it raises issues that could 
splinter the city. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, the most recent in a spate of such actions this year, bans 
construction of buildings over 25 feet high -- two-stories -- along the 
district's major arteries, including Broadway, 4th, 7th and 10th streets. 
</P>
<P>
A plan developed a year ago called for the city to concentrate multistory 
housing along such thoroughfares. But area residents sought the moratorium that 
temporarily bans such multistory projects because they blame them for 
increasing congestion and crime. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Robert Paternoster said that at least two planned 
multistory projects will be frozen by the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Long Beach officials have been pushed by community 
activists to construct low-income housing throughout the city. Such projects 
have been a part of an aggressive redevelopment program that has stressed 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
But adoption of the 2nd District's construction moratorium, as well as similar 
freezes enacted by the council earlier this year for other districts, signals a 
shift away from that redevelopment policy. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, development has increased dramatically in the 2nd District, a 
mix of neighborhoods encompassing some of the city's most affluent and most 
impoverished areas. It also includes several blocks of middle-class 
neighborhoods dominated by old-fashioned California bungalows and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen residents of these areas showed up at Tuesday's meeting to complain 
that development of low-income housing has increased the number of drug deals, 
assaults and robberies in their streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fed up with rampant development and the crime it's brought to the 
community," said Catherine LaRosa. 
</P>
<P>
But Paternoster called such comments "too simplistic." He said that low-income 
housing is being unfairly blamed for the city's problems. 
</P>
<P>
City councilmen, though, have found themselves increasingly squeezed in a 
political vice as they try to reconcile pressure from anti-growth residents and 
pro-growth real estate agents. On Tuesday, several said they are concerned that 
some of the same developments they and their predecessors voted for this past 
decade are destroying middle-class neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Blocks and blocks of bungalows have been replaced with brand new, cheap 
apartment buildings jammed with welfare people and other low-income people," 
Councilman Wallace Edgerton said. He said he had proposed the "emergency" 
moratorium to cut down on crime in his district. 
</P>
<P>
It passed 7 to 2. The two councilmen who opposed Edgerton's proposal voiced 
concern that the restrictions implied that poor people are responsible for the 
city's growing crime.

Moviegoers who have been around the county for a while may remember a Pacific 
Theaters drive-in off Borchard Avenue in Thousand Oaks. Since it closed about 
six years ago, the lot has been sprouting weeds. Now, however, folks at that 
same theater chain are planning a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
OK, now for a chance to go for what's behind curtain No. 3. . . . Which Rudolph 
Valentino movie was partially filmed in Oxnard? If you said "The Sheik," give 
yourself some extra butter on that popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
"They had big old sand dunes in Oxnard," said Richard Senate, the historian at 
Ventura's Olivas Adobe. "There weren't a lot of people there, and it was a lot 
closer than going to the Mojave Desert." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the filmmakers used the sand at what is now the mouth of Port 
Hueneme Harbor. Before it was dredged, the area also featured a lagoon that 
served as a nice oasis, around which prop people planted papier-mache palm 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
Senate will offer up other Ventura County film trivia similar to these tidbits 
as part of silent movie night, Saturday at the Olivas Adobe. After a short 
history lesson, he will present three films, the feature attraction being the 
1925 classic "The Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to "Phantom," Senate will show "Pedigreedy," the 1927 Felix the Cat 
cartoon, which contains one of the earliest recorded musical scores, and 
"Doing, Doing, Done" (1918), starring Bebe Daniels and Snub Pollard. The last 
one is the story of two con men who are foiled by a phony fortuneteller. In the 
tradition of old silent movies, piano accompaniment will be provided. The 
pianist is Robert Barnum of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the debut of silent films at the Adobe. A good turnout, Senate 
said, could mean a much larger schedule next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Adobe, by the way, has its own claim to cinematic fame. Back in 1912, The 
Melies Star Film Co. of Santa Paula used the site to shoot the movie "The 
Gringo Strikes." Senate won't be showing the film because no one has been able 
to locate it. "It's kind of a reverse Zorro. That's all I know about it," 
Senate said. "For all we know, it is gone now." 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free. The lecture will begin a little after 7 p.m. and Senate will 
talk until it gets dark enough to show the films (about half an hour). 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer talkies, there's an auditory option Saturday night. Being 
the third Saturday of the month, the Thousand Oaks Library has scheduled 
"Classic Cinema Night." 
</P>
<P>
This month's classic is "The Roof," a 1956 film directed by Vittorio De Sica. 
"It's about the struggles of a young married couple trying to find a place of 
their own," said Amani Fliers, a member of the movie selection committee. 
"That's a very contemporary topic, right?" 
</P>
<P>
The movie will begin shortly after 7 p.m., with a discussion afterward. 
Admission is $1. LEO SMITH

<P>
HOLLYWOOD: AT LEAST 5 GANG MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS. 
POLICE SAY FOUR OR FIVE RIVAL FACTIONS APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are searching for the reasons behind a flurry of violent clashes that 
have erupted between rival gangs in Hollywood, leaving at least five gang 
members dead in the last three weeks alone. 
</P>
<P>
So far, police have few suspects, and even fewer answers. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, Hollywood has erupted on us," said Detective Michael 
DePasquale of the Los Angeles Police Department's Westside anti-gang unit, 
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, or CRASH. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not like there are two gangs at war with each other," DePasquale said. 
"It seems like numerous gangs are involved. We have no idea what is going on 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Until the latest outburst, armed clashes were relatively uncommon in Hollywood, 
he said, but he noted that violence can surge without apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
What is troubling to CRASH unit members and authorities from LAPD's Hollywood 
Division in this instance, they say, is the number of gangs -- at least four or 
five -- that appear to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they have suspects in only one of the slayings and they are trying 
to determine if there is a pattern to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Usually there are pay-backs after each gang slaying, and an already beefed-up 
CRASH unit is bracing for the inevitable. "I expect more," DePasquale said. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent gang clash, one youth was killed, another paralyzed from the 
waist down and a third seriously injured during a drive-by shooting at 10:30 
p.m. Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Reynosa, 14, of Northeast Los Angeles was walking down the 600 block 
of North Harvard Boulevard with some friends when rival gang members drove by 
in a car, yelled gang slogans and fired numerous shots at the three youths, 
according to homicide Detective Russell Kuster of Hollywood Division. He said 
that Reynosa was pronounced dead at the scene and that the conditions of the 
other two youths have not changed since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects or motives in that case. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 6, a 25-year-old suspected gang member was killed in an afternoon 
drive-by shooting at Melrose Avenue and Harvard Boulevard. Police said they 
have no arrests or suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Two more gang members were killed in separate incidents on Aug. 3. In the 
first, two groups of rival gangs were walking down Fountain Avenue near Gower 
Street at about 7 a.m. when one suspect shot two gang members, killing one at 
the scene and injuring the other. Police said they arrested two suspects 
several hours later, one a juvenile and one an adult. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:15 p.m. that night, rival gang members began arguing at a gas station at 
Melrose and Wilton Place when one suspect shot two rivals, killing one and 
seriously wounding another. Police said they have suspects in that case but 
have made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
On July 20, two groups from rival gangs confronted each other about 5 p.m. at 
the corner of Oxford Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. Gang slogans were shouted, 
and one group started chasing members of the other on foot while firing at 
them. One suspected gang member struck by at least one bullet was pronounced 
dead at the scene.

AQMD IS TOLD ACID BAN MIGHT DOOM REFINERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One small Santa Fe Springs oil refinery said it would have to close and another 
said its existence would be threatened if air quality officials enact a 
proposed ban on the bulk use of hydrofluoric acid at their plants. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District says the ban is needed to 
prevent a potential catastrophe that could threaten the lives of thousands 
living near four Southland refineries and a refrigerant manufacturing plant 
that use the acutely hazardous substance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four refineries that use the substance have previously complained 
about the financial burden of converting to less volatile sulfuric acid, the 
statements by the Golden West Refining Co. and Powerine Oil Co. spokesmen 
during an AQMD hearing last week mark the first time that industry officials 
have said refineries might have to close. 
</P>
<P>
A final hearing on the proposed ban, which is to include comment on 
environmental and socioeconomic impact reports, is scheduled for Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Both sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids are used in a process that boosts the 
octane of unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD has previously cited industry-sponsored tests that showed a two-minute 
release of 1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid would form a dense, 
ground-hugging cloud of gas and vapor that could threaten life five miles 
downwind. Also cited was a history of accidents that resulted in large-scale 
releases of the substance. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing Friday, Golden West spokesman David Dragt said flatly that a 
hydrofluoric acid ban "would force the closure of the refinery" and that the 
immediate consequences would be the loss of 250 refinery jobs, as well as 1,000 
positions in the Thrifty Oil gasoline station chain. Noting that Thrifty, 
Golden West's main customer for gasoline, is the area's largest independent 
gasoline retailer, Dragt said the ban "would result in higher gasoline prices" 
for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Powerine spokesman David Moore said the refinery "would be placed in jeopardy" 
by elimination of hydrofluoric acid. He said tight space on refinery grounds 
would prevent the refinery from constructing a sulfuric acid unit while 
continuing to operate the hydrofluoric acid unit. 
</P>
<P>
Two larger refineries -- Mobil in Torrance and Ultramar in Wilmington -- also 
use the chemical to boost the octane of unleaded gasoline and also oppose the 
regulation, but they have stopped short of saying the conversion to sulfuric 
acid would force a closure. 
</P>
<P>
Allied Signal, the fifth large-scale user that also would come under the 
proposed ban, uses hydrofluoric acid to make refrigerants and has said it would 
have to close its El Segundo plant because no substitute exists for 
hydrofluoric acid in its process. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic consequences, industry consultant Geoffrey Kaiser 
said the air quality agency was premature in declaring that hydrofluoric acid 
poses an unacceptable risk. Kaiser said the agency should first set a uniform 
standard for acceptable risk before imposing a ban and then measure the risk of 
a serious accident involving continued hydrofluoric acid against that standard. 
</P>
<P>
But Kaiser declined to answer when AQMD planning director Barry Wallerstein 
asked him how many people would have to suffer serious consequences before an 
incident would be rated a major accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to defer that," Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
In the largest recent accident involving hydrofluoric acid, 4,000 people were 
evacuated in 1987 when a cloud of hydrofluoric acid vapors escaped from the 
Marathon refinery in Texas City, Tex.

PURSUING A COURT CAREER;

<P>
PETERS MAKING HIS CASE FOR COACHING VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alec Peters can hear it coming every time someone he meets discovers he has a 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
The progression of questions begins innocently: Where did you graduate from?" 
</P>
<P>
 It builds to curiosity: "Did you pass the bar?" 
</P>
<P>
 It crescendoes with the incredulous: "What in the world are you doing coaching 
volleyball?" 
</P>
<P>
 Peters laughs when he recounts the familiar inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"My ultimate goal is to coach with the men's U. S. national team," Peters says. 
"That goal is a ways off, but I'm doing everything I can to reach that goal." 
</P>
<P>
Everything might be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, 29, is the women's volleyball coach at Occidental College, an assistant 
coach for the defending national champion USC men's team and he also is 
involved in U. S. national team programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the best situation possible," Peters says. "I'm at USC working with a 
good coach (Jim McLaughlin), but I still have my own program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy with where I am." 
</P>
<P>
Peters is currently in Japan for three exhibitions with the women's national 
team, then he will continue on to China for the world championships next week. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in New York, the only traveling Peters thought he would be doing was 
the commute from a law office to the court room. 
</P>
<P>
But he vividly remembers the day he told his proud parents that, after 
graduating from Adelphi University and the University of North Carolina school 
of law, and passing the state bar in North Carolina, the only court he was 
interested in was the one on which volleyball was played. 
</P>
<P>
"After seven years of putting me through school, that didn't go over too well 
with my father," Peters says. "I guess that's every parent's nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Peters caught the volleyball coaching bug when he played on a club team in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
During his final year of law school in Chapel Hill, N.C., Peters coached the 
school's club team, which featured a student who was a member of the Greek 
national team. On the player's recommendation, Peters was hired as a scout for 
the 1986 world championships in France. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he accompanied the Greeks to the European Championships, where they 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Peters came to Southern California to work at a junior elite team 
tryout in Huntington Beach, where he met then-USC Coach Bob Yoder. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a major, major break," Peters says. "He was looking for a full-time 
assistant and I was looking for a job." 
</P>
<P>
In April of 1989, Peters was hired at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Peters took over a team that was 4-25 and turned it into one that 
finished 12-12 overall and fourth in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
He then assisted first-year USC Coach Jim McLaughlin as the Trojans won the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaching men is different from coaching women," Peters says. "At Oxy, we spend 
an enormous amount of time teaching the mental aspect of the game. At USC we 
talk about it, but we don't take specific time out to work on it." 
</P>
<P>
In April and May, Peters commuted from Los Angeles to U. S. national team 
headquarters in San Diego to supervise workouts for the men's B team. Last 
month he accompanied the women's team to the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the work, Peters' combined wages from his coaching assignments pale 
when compared to those of even a first-year lawyer at a major firm. But he 
likes the net return volleyball provides. 
</P>
<P>
"I barely get by," Peters says. "I'm still struggling to make ends meet, but I 
love what I'm doing so I wouldn't trade it for anything." 
</P>
<P>
When Peters returns from China, he will begin preparing Occidental for the 
coming season. The Tigers have a strong returning nucleus that includes senior 
setter Cathy Clark, junior outside hitter Kathy Lobel and senior back-row 
specialist Jackie Yoon. 
</P>
<P>
Peters is also excited about a recruiting class led by Amy Sullivan, a 
5-foot-11 middle blocker from St. Louis who will be one of five freshmen 
fighting for starting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got everything going for us," Peters says. "In a couple of years, I 
think we can be the best program in Division III. We're way ahead of schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's main competition for the SCIAC title figures to come from La 
Verne, the defending conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
"If we finish second in the SCIAC this year, I'll be happy," he says. "But you 
never know. All we have to do is upset La Verne once and we could tie for the 
title."

<P>
The best team in the major leagues last year calls Oakland home. And the city 
may be home to the nation's top Babe Ruth team as well. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night in Carson City, Nev., a team from Oakland swept a doubleheader 
from La Crescenta to win the Babe Ruth Western Regional and advance to the 
World Series this week in Jamestown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The team of 13-year-olds from La Crescenta had entered the contest from the 
winners' bracket and needed just one victory to advance to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, however, won, 2-0, in the first game and came back with a 7-2 victory 
to claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
Championship drive: Two Glendale-area softball teams are competing in division 
World Series championships this week at Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Centennial League all-stars (13-to-15-year-olds) advanced to the Senior 
Division World Series by sweeping two games from Red Bluff, Calif., in the 
Western Regional last week at Pinole, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial lost to Georgetown, Mich., 1-0, Monday in an opening-round game at 
the World Series. They played a losers' bracket game Wednesday, but results 
were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberty League all-stars (10-to-12-years-old) advanced to the series by 
defeating Quito, Calif., 2-0, at Pinole. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty played defending champion Naples, Fla., in an opening-round game 
Tuesday. Results were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
Homecoming: Cal Linam, a former cross-country and track standout at Glendale 
College and Cal State Long Beach, has been named cross-country coach and 
assistant track coach at Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
Linam, 28, succeeds Dave Kemp, 51, who coached at Burbank from 1974-86 and 
1987-90. Kemp, Linam's father-in-law, will take over the sophomore football 
program and continue to coach golf. 
</P>
<P>
The Western State Conference runner-up in the steeplechase in 1983 for Glendale 
College, Linam has a best of 9 minutes 4.4 seconds in the event. He was also a 
member of the 1981 Vaquero cross-country team that placed third in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Linam, who taught English at Hoover High last year, will teach freshman and 
sophomore English at Burbank.

FREE CLINIC FINDS HOLLYWOOD YOUTH CENTER SITE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: WITH $1.3 MILLION PLEDGED FROM STATE AND CITY AGENCIES, THE CLINIC IS 
NOW TURNING TO PRIVATE SOURCES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

The Los Angeles Free Clinic has found a site for its Hollywood Youth Center and 
is now trying to raise private funds to buy the building so it can better 
address the social and medical needs of runaway and homeless youths. 
</P>
<P>
State and city agencies have already committed $1.3 million to the Free Clinic 
for the center. The purchase and renovation of the building at 6043 Hollywood 
Blvd., near Gower Street, are expected to cost $1.9 million, said Andi Sobbe, 
the clinic's development director. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this week, the clinic is sending formal proposals to foundations and 
local corporations, outlining its goal of a comprehensive health care and 
social services network in the heart of Hollywood, which attracts vast numbers 
of runaway and homeless youths, Sobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping the local Hollywood community will come together to support us," 
Sobbe said. "This building is an opportunity to really move into Hollywood and 
be able to serve the kids. They have so many needs that often one single agency 
can't answer all of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood property is in escrow, and Sobbe said few details are available 
about the building itself. But funding is expected in time to allow the site to 
be renovated and opened by January, 1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The project has received $225,000 from the city's Community Development 
Department, $750,000 from the city's Community Redevelopment Agency and 
$325,000 from the state Department of Health Services, Sobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
The center would house the Free Clinic's High Risk Youth Program, which has 
been run since 1982 through the clinic's headquarters at 8405 Beverly Blvd. in 
Los Angeles in conjunction with Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As in the existing program, staff and volunteers would see street youths from 
12 to 24 years of age, treating medical needs while trying to gain the youths' 
confidence to address overall mental health and lifestyle needs. 
</P>
<P>
A multidisciplinary team of physicians, social workers, AIDS and drug abuse 
specialists, and peer counselors already review each person's case and develop 
a plan to help coordinate their care. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Clinic relies on 500 doctors, dentists, nurses, counselors, lawyers 
and others to help anyone who comes through its doors. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Clinic will continue to treat high-risk youths at its headquarters, 
but concern over the large numbers of low-income youths in Hollywood who were 
not seeking treatment prompted the move, according to Sobbe and Gary Yates, 
director of the High Risk Youth Program. 
</P>
<P>
The youths fear and distrust other hospitals, because employees there might 
contact authorities, clinic officials say. And many youths do not receive 
needed care because they have no way of getting to the Free Clinic and do not 
want to spend an hour each way riding buses, said Yates, who is also an 
associate director at Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be right in the heart of Hollywood, where the drop-in centers and 
major shelters where the kids stay are," Yates said. "With that kind of 
location, we expect to see more of the kids drop in and get medical attention, 
and less cancellation of appointments." 
</P>
<P>
Only after medical care is administered can the long process of getting the 
youths off the streets begin, Sobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
"Success is measured in very small steps with these kids," she said. "Just 
keeping one of them on birth control for six months is considered a real 
success."

TRIAL ORDERED ON RAPE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former nurse's aide at a Glendale nursing home was ordered to stand trial 
Tuesday on charges that he raped and sodomized an elderly patient while working 
at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Municipal Judge Charles E. Horan found that there was sufficient 
evidence to try Roy Alton Seaton, 45, of Burbank, on charges of sodomy, rape 
with a foreign object and sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
Seaton, who is in County Jail, will be arraigned Aug. 29 in Pasadena Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Seaton was arrested June 28 after a nursing supervisor at Autumn Hills 
Convalescent Home allegedly caught him sexually assaulting an 82-year-old woman 
who had Alzheimer's disease. He was later fired. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators told Autumn Hills officials that Seaton was convicted in 1983 of 
lewd conduct with a child. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Los Angeles County officials levied an $11,000 fine against the home 
because the victim allegedly suffered physical and sexual abuse and because 
administrators allegedly failed to check the employee's background.

NEW MUNICIPAL COURT PLANNED NEAR AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An architect will be hired within the next two months to design a new municipal 
court near Los Angeles International Airport to reduce overcrowding at the West 
Los Angeles Municipal Court on Purdue Avenue, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Planning for the court at Aviation Boulevard and 111th Street remained on track 
last week with the inclusion of $9.5 million for the work in the annual budget 
approved by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse, to be completed in 1995 at a cost of $70 million, is projected 
to include 12 to 18 courtrooms, said Rob Quist, deputy administrator of the Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Development Corp. will build the courthouse as part of Continental 
City, a development east of LAX that includes two hotels and 2 million square 
feet of offices. Continental Development will select the architect, but the 
Board of Supervisors must validate the choice. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they hope use of the private developer will keep 
construction costs down. Supervisors have increasingly turned over construction 
and other projects to the private sector, believing that a company driven by 
profits will work more efficiently than government. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the new facility will reduce by 60% the caseload at the West 
Los Angeles Municipal Court, Quist said. The Purdue Avenue facility is 
overloaded with 11 judges and their staffs, seven more than the facility was 
designed to accommodate. Two jurists are forced to work out of rented 
storefront space formerly occupied by a drugstore and a shoe store. Other 
judges work in trailers or conference rooms rented from the City of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The place is way beyond its capacity, and we can't provide the kind of service 
that we need to," Quist said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the new courthouse is completed, several courtrooms will be moved to 
temporary quarters. Two traffic courts and a small-claims court will move late 
this year to rented offices on Robertson Boulevard, near Hamilton High School, 
Quist said. Plans call for all West Los Angeles judges currently housed in 
trailers to move into city-owned offices by early 1991.

THEATER REVIEW: 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE'; 
</P>
<P>
MISCAST SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
THE ROLES WEREN'T TRADITIONAL, BUT TROUPE COMES UP WITH ENTERTAINING 
SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a current hoo-ha on Broadway over whether a Caucasian actor should be 
allowed to play a Eurasian in the hit London musical "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
Actors' Equity, the union that's objecting to the casting, had better stay away 
from "The Merchant of Venice," at Libbey Bowl in Ojai through this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Emmanuel and Julie Talbott, who play Shylock and his daughter, may or may 
not be Jewish. But a woman, Jaye Hersh, plays the male clown, Launcelot Gobbo; 
Rodman Casselberry portrays the Prince of Morocco in blackface; and it's 
unlikely that other featured cast members, including Virginia Streat, Cecil 
Sutton, Edward T. Buckle, Mary Wolk . . . you get the idea . . . are of Italian 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare, the stage and Ojai are all likely to survive this casting, which 
Actors' Equity would evidently consider a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
Others might find the show to be a reasonably entertaining way to spend a 
couple of hours under the stars, in an ambience of lush foliage, with little to 
distract your attention from the stage -- little, that is, save for crickets, 
occasional motorcycles, children (in the park and in the audience) and a church 
bell that tolls the hour. 
</P>
<P>
The distractions are minor, though, and the show's a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, the producers are less worried about incurring the wrath of Actors' 
Equity than of people who find Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, to be an 
offensive stereotype. Those who do take offense, though, are people who haven't 
seen the play -- or at least who haven't paid too much attention to it: It's 
quite clear that Shylock's hostility toward the Christian characters in the 
play is in reaction to the way they've treated him. 
</P>
<P>
Shylock's daughter is romanced by a presumably Catholic Italian, and she's 
entirely sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
The whole Shylock encounter (in which he demands a pound of flesh as payment 
for a loan Antonio can't repay) is the trigger for the play's more important 
theme, in which a woman, Portia, must disguise herself as a man to serve as the 
defense attorney for her thick-witted fiance. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a silly subplot concerning the suitor whom Portia will marry; 
whichever of the three chooses the container that holds her portrait wins her 
hand. Either Venice wasn't particularly civilized in those days, or Shakespeare 
was adapting an already elderly fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, it's this subplot, and two ill-fated suitors -- the Prince of 
Morocco, whose shoulder-length hair and walrus mustache make him resemble 
singer David Crosby, and the Prince of Aragon (David Douglas), who speaks with 
an accent somewhere between Pepe Le Pew and the Swedish Chef -- that provide 
much of the show's low comedy. 
</P>
<P>
As has been true of most of this Summer's spate of Ventura County Shakespeare, 
accents vary from stage English to contemporary American. Jaye Hersh, who plays 
clown Launcelot Gobbo, speaks like a '90s woman, yet she seems far more 
comfortable with the Shakespearean dialogue than many of the other actors, who 
tend to rush through their lines. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran local actress Streat, who plays Portia, is regal and witty, if (to be 
less than chivalrous) a bit beyond the age when Venetian women were then 
betrothed. Ronald Rezak, late of the Plaza Players' "Frankie and Johnny in the 
Clair de Lune," plays her main suitor, Bassanio, with great enthusiasm. As 
Gobbo's blind father, David Farley has a good comic scene with his son. 
</P>
<P>
There are no sets to speak of, just some bushes, some rocks and a few pieces of 
furniture. The costumes, by contrast, are quite elaborate -- credit K&amp;L 
Design, which also works with the Illusions Theatre Company of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Director Paul Backer keeps things moving smoothly enough, though the 
inconsistency of tone among the various individual performances is somewhat 
jarring. 
</P>
<P>
"The Merchant of Venice" is the Royal Shakespeare Revels' eighth annual show. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "The Merchant of Venice" can be seen this Friday through 
Sunday nights at 7:30 at Libbey Bowl in Libbey Park, on Ojai Avenue in Ojai. 
Admission is $10 for adults, $8 for students and seniors, and free for children 
under 13. Call 646-2917 for further information and reservations.

WHAT'S FRESH: BUYING OPPORTUNITIES; 
</P>
<P>
FROM THE HIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THE HONEY THAT BEES PRODUCE IS A POPULAR AND MARKETABLE COMMODITY THAT IS 
READILY AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTY.

<P>
Ever wonder what those stacks of white, boxlike structures are that can be seen 
in so many orchards and fields across Ventura County? 
</P>
<P>
Most likely they're beehives. And inside, thousands of bees are busily 
manufacturing that sweet, syrupy substance used for everything from topping on 
a slice of toast to soothing a sore throat. 
</P>
<P>
While pollination is a chief reason the bee is among a farmer's best friends, 
the honey they produce from blossom nectar is a popular and marketable 
commodity -- and available in Ventura County straight from the beehive. 
</P>
<P>
Friend's Ranch in Ojai handles its own bees and sells honey at its roadside 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
As explained by Friend's Ranch Manager Tony Thatcher, the production of honey 
is quite easy because "the bees do most of the work." 
</P>
<P>
The bees are provided a wooden boxlike hive already outfitted with sheets of 
beeswax to expedite the honey-making process. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually 10 wood-framed sheets of beeswax are placed inside the hive and are 
stamped with a hexagon pattern. The bees will build up from the pattern and 
construct the tiny cells that make up the honeycomb. 
</P>
<P>
"Each hive houses one queen bee and her sole purpose is to lay eggs in those 
cells," Thatcher said, "and the total population of a hive can be 20,000 to 
50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the hive population consists of male drones with a sole purpose of 
"mating with the queen just once and then just kind of kicking back and 
eating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen's brood is nourished by a hard-driven, all-female contingent of 
worker bees that spend their six-week life span gathering nectar from 
blossoming plants and trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Returning to the hive, they regurgitate the nectar and fill the cells with 
it," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
And "it" is what we know to be honey. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they fill the cell with honey -- and they will, whether it contains 
larvae or not -- they cap each one," Thatcher said. "When you're ready to 
extract the honey, the top layer of wax from each sheet is sliced off." 
</P>
<P>
Honey is extracted from the comb by employing a hand-cranked device, creating a 
centrifugal force, draining the honey into a holding tub. Each framed sheet 
contains one to two pounds of honey. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we then filter it and put it in a jar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said that multileveled hives are used to isolate the larvae, thereby 
limiting the need for honey filtration, which also removes wax and dirt 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the tricks is to keep the larvae in one level and honey in another. If 
you can keep the queen in the bottom level, she will lay her eggs only in the 
bottom," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, the opening between levels inside the hive is made so the queen is 
hindered from passing through. 
</P>
<P>
"The queen is three- to five-times bigger than the workers so the hole is made 
too small to pass through," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
And does all this human interference deprive the bees of food? Thatcher says 
no, since the bees are always producing more than they need. 
</P>
<P>
With no rain for the past four years, Thatcher said this has been a bad time 
for beekeepers whose bees depend on wild flowers for nectar. "With the drought 
there are far fewer blossoms," he said. Some beekeepers compensate by supplying 
bees with sugar water, which produces honey that is less desirable and less 
flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
The different varieties of honey, such as clover and orange, are simply 
determined by the type of blossom from which the bees extract nectar, Thatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The tastes do differ. The avocado, for instance, is much darker, almost like 
molasses and stronger tasting than most. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want a particular type, say like almond honey, the bees must be placed 
in a blossoming almond orchard. You have to extract the honey before moving the 
hives to another area so there is no mixing of nectars," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that bees will travel over a mile from the hive, it's difficult to ensure 
a pure variety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friend's Ranch offers a sage and orange blossom blend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice aromatic honey and one of the more popular," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
The going rate for a pound of honey is about $1.60. 
</P>
<P>
Friend's Ranch is at 15150 Maricopa Highway, Ojai. Call 646-2871. RODNEY BOSCH

SOUTH GATE COUNCIL FIRES ADMINISTRATOR;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city administrator has been ousted by the City Council, a day after he 
announced plans to retire in March. 
</P>
<P>
The council emerged from a closed session Tuesday and demanded that City 
Administrator Bruce Spragg resign by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
"The council wants to hire its own administrator," said Mayor Robert A. 
Philipp, who added that the council will name an interim city administrator 
while a search goes on for a permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Spragg, 57, who has been city administrator for more than eight years, revealed 
his retirement plans publicly Monday at the regular council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he wanted to provide enough advance notice to ensure a smooth 
transition and that he had told the council about his retirement plans in an 
Aug. 10 letter. 
</P>
<P>
Spragg said he was surprised by the council's swift action: "I respect the 
council's right to hire anyone they want, but I think this isn't right for the 
city. It doesn't provide for an orderly transition." 
</P>
<P>
Spragg is the fourth top-level administrator to leave the city since the April 
election that saw three new council members elected. The new members -- Johnny 
Ramirez, Mary Ann Buckles and Larry Leonard -- were supported by Philipp and 
Vice Mayor Gregory Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Herbert W. Cranton was defeated in the last council election, and 
two other incumbents did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Cranton criticized the council's action: "This is really a bad move. It is 
really a loss to the city. I worked with Spragg for eight years. He knew what 
he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Spragg, who made $87,000 a year, had been in government service for more than 
29 years. Before coming to South Gate, he was city manager of Santa Ana for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Philipp said: "The council has a right to hire a city attorney and a chief 
administrator. We are merely exercising our prerogative." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Bruce Boogaard resigned May 25 to become Chula Vista's chief 
attorney. William B. Rudell was named interim city attorney for South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director Rollie Berry retired in July, and Parks and Recreation 
Department Director George Price left the same month to take a better-paying 
job with the Moreno Valley parks and recreation department, Philipp said. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the election, the council, including Philipp and Slaughter, 
approved better job protection and more severance for top administrators. But 
the newly elected council, with Philipp and Slaughter reversing their 
positions, voted to rescind that resolution.

2 GROUPS AID PUSH FOR MALIBU INCORPORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MURRAY, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its battle to become a city, Malibu found new allies this week. 
</P>
<P>
Two municipal government organizations -- the Los Angeles Division of the 
League of California Cities and the Contract Cities Assn. -- started lobbying 
to speed up cityhood for the famed beach community. 
</P>
<P>
The league sent a letter to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors urging 
immediate incorporation of Malibu, and League President Hal Croyts urged the 84 
member cities to pass their own council resolutions supporting Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu residents voted overwhelmingly in June to incorporate, but the Board of 
Supervisors, which has resisted the cityhood effort for years, invoked a novel 
legal interpretation to postpone the date of incorporation until next March. 
Last month, an appellate judge ruled that the county had sufficient legal 
grounds for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to the residents and their newly elected representatives to delay 
implementation (of cityhood)," said the league's letter, which was signed by 
Croyts, a Lomita city councilman. "What's at stake here is the right of the 
people to govern themselves. The people of Malibu made a decision to 
incorporate and the county of Los Angeles shouldn't interfere with it." 
</P>
<P>
The 70-member Contract Cities Assn. was also preparing a letter to the board 
this week, according to Sam Olivito Jr., executive director of the statewide 
group. "We're firmly in support of a community's effort to self-governing," he 
said. "We've been watching this situation all along, and we decided to take 
action after the July 18 court ruling delaying cityhood until next year." 
</P>
<P>
The two letters coincide with a mail campaign launched Tuesday in Malibu to get 
a state law passed to let the area incorporate now. The council-elect urged 
residents to flood Sacramento legislators with letters in support of a bill by 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that could go to the Assembly floor as 
early as today and to the Senate next week. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow Malibu to incorporate next January instead of in March. An 
emergency clause approved by the Senate Rules Committee Tuesday would let the 
community incorporate immediately, but that provision needs a two-thirds vote 
from both houses for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative session ends Aug. 30, "so we haven't much time," said Malibu 
lobbyist Anthony Gonsalves. "But we've got equity on our side."

One candidate for the title is Rita Dayton, who maintains an alternative 
lifestyle in suburban Simi Valley. Dayton is a shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
Her operation has the engaging title, From Ewe to You, and she sells lambs for 
breeding, fleeces, spun wool, elegant knitted socks and sweaters, and spinning 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how one thing led to another," Dayton said. "It's like an 
obsession or a disease, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
A full-time teacher at Royal High School in Simi Valley until last year, Dayton 
worked sheep into her schedule. Until the drought began three years ago, she 
ran flocks of up to 700 animals, all in Moorpark and Simi Valley, where she 
could commute to them twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
This week Dayton is on duty at the Ventura County Fair, where she may be found 
near the livestock exhibits -- wearing wool, spinning wool, talking about its 
merits, and officiating at Saturday night's down-home style spinning contest. 
</P>
<P>
It was a spinning demonstration at the Fair in 1973 that first launched her 
hobby. Within days of watching it, she had sent off to New Zealand for a 
spinning wheel in kit form. 
</P>
<P>
"It had an instruction book with it," she said, "and there were no classes in 
the area, so I taught myself." 
</P>
<P>
And a new way of life began. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton's heritage is not farming. She grew up in West Berlin, where she found 
herself embarrassed by a society that had allowed itself to be taken over by 
Nazi ideology. She applied herself to learning French and English, and to her 
parents' dismay, emigrated to Quebec upon graduating from high school in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of those people listening to the Voice of America," she said. "I 
believed all that. And it really was the way they said -- you could leave your 
doors unlocked then." 
</P>
<P>
She went to New York the following year, married a machinist and took a job as 
an inventory clerk in a handbag factory. She determined to become a teacher 
after hearing President Kennedy's inaugural message -- "Ask not what your 
country can do for you, . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The family came West to raise their only son in wide open spaces. Dayton 
enrolled at Cal State Northridge (then called Valley State College). Four years 
later, in 1966, she had a master's degree in German and began teaching 
languages in Simi Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
She combined the roles of teacher and spinner, giving many spinning lessons 
over the years, mostly at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as she began knitting, she wanted to add color to her designs. But the 
color had to come from the sheep -- she doesn't use dye. So in the '70s she 
decided to "raise a few animals of my own." 
</P>
<P>
She chose to breed the Rambouillet sheep because of its fine, long wool. The 
first couple of years there were just a handful of them. Like pets, each had a 
name. All of her sheep still do. 
</P>
<P>
Some names are more romantic than others. Dayton has a weakness for Wagnerian 
opera, so there is a Siegfried and a Brunhilde. But with so many in the flock, 
she had to start passing out some ordinary names out of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
The breeder knows all of her animals well. She tries to be with each ewe when 
it lambs; she does her own feeding and nursing, and she castrates the surplus 
rams. She is up at 4:30 year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the one morning you decide to come late is the time they got out, or one 
has snakebite," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the sheep have given Dayton more than just a living -- they 
have also been responsible for adding two languages to her repertoire. The 
daytime herders she hired, who were generally from Mexico, taught her Spanish, 
which she was soon teaching at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
And during sheep research trips to the Pyrenees on the French-Spanish border, 
she became charmed by the Basque language. It seemed to have no practical use, 
but she liked the challenge of it. 
</P>
<P>
Then she discovered a Basque settlement in Chino. There she could practice the 
language on Sundays and still drive home in time to pen up her sheep. Since her 
divorce in 1977 and her son's independence shortly thereafter, the visits have 
become important social events. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all age groups," she said. "There's a family-style lunch -- the men play 
cards after. They have folk dances. It's very much like being in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
During the week it is quiet at her leased acreage near the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"If the phone doesn't ring, I go through days when I literally only talk to the 
sheep," she said, sounding pleased with the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
For Dayton, the work of the big herds which she sold for meat is over. 
</P>
<P>
"If prices are just right I figure on making $10 a head, and prices haven't 
been right very often," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She will keep only a few dozen wool animals from now on, and feels the sheep 
industry in America -- down to a quarter of what it was after World War II -- 
is doomed because of foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sheep are more of a passion than an income for her. It takes every 
spare moment in the course of a week to knit a pair of high boot socks, which 
sell for $25. Creating sweaters, which go for over $200, is inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
The answer for most entrepreneurial knitters is the knitting machine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do that," Dayton said. I want a hand-raised sheep, hand-spun 
wool, and clothes hand knit." 
</P>
<P>
And so, her profits -- at least monetary ones -- are illusory. But it's OK with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people spend money going to a psychiatrist or dressing for nice 
restaurants," she said. "I spend my money this way, and it comes out the same." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Rita Dayton and her sheep can be seen at the Ventura County 
Fair through Aug. 26. The Fair is located at the corner of Harbor Boulevard and 
Figueroa Street in downtown Ventura. Fair exhibits will be open from 11 a.m. to 
10 p.m. and the carnival and midway, from 11 a.m. to midnight. General 
admission is $5, seniors 55 and over and children 6 to 12 pay $2, and children 
under 5 get in free. On-site parking costs $3. 
</P>

<P>
UP CLOSE: RITA DAYTON 
</P>
<P>
Age: 54 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Shepherd 
</P>
<P>
Favorite sheep in her flock: Texas. "She is from Texas and that's her name. She 
has really fine wool and she lambs every seven or eight months. She's just real 
hearty. She's sort of the boss there. She has this secret code with me. I 
secretly give her extra treats. She goes behind the barn or stands away from 
the others and makes eye contact with me or gives one very low baa." 
</P>
<P>
Fastest she's ever knitted a pair of socks: One week. "I don't even finish a 
pair a month on the average." 
</P>
<P>
Number of pairs of wool socks she owns: 12. "Some are over 10 years old. When 
the feet wear out, I just cut them out and make new feet."

PARK SUPPORTERS BACK SUPERVISOR REALIGNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN ED EDELMAN'S 
DISTRICT. HE IS SEEN AS SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONSERVATION CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Park advocates involved in efforts to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains are 
keeping their fingers crossed in hopes that a court-ordered redrawing of Los 
Angeles County supervisorial districts will survive an appeal by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say the boundary realignment, intended to create a Latino 
majority district, will also help their cause by putting the mountains in a 
single district to be served by Supervisor Ed Edelman. They consider Edelman 
more attuned to environmental concerns than the area's current representatives, 
Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana, who have traditionally sided with developers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it augurs well," said one conservationist, who would not allow herself 
to be quoted by name. "I kneel by the side of my bed each night and pray that 
map goes through." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tryon, executive officer for the Los Angeles/Ventura region of the 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, acknowledged that the 
redistricting "has a potential of boding less favorably for us as an industry" 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. But Tryon said the association will go on 
working "with the Board of Supervisors . . . regardless of how their boundary 
lines may be drawn." 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting map drawn by civil rights groups was approved Aug. 3 by U.S. 
District Judge David V. Kenyon. He ruled in June that the supervisors had 
intentionally discriminated against Latinos by drawing the existing district 
boundaries so as to dilute their voting strength. The county appealed that 
ruling and last week got the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay 
implemention of the reapportionment plan, pending a hearing scheduled for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monicas currently are split into three districts. Edelman's district 
includes the eastern end of the mountains from Griffith Park to the San Diego 
Freeway, but Dana and Antonovich represent the less-developed western areas 
where most development battles are being fought. Dana's current district 
includes the Malibu coast and the Santa Monicas' southern slopes, and 
Antonovich's includes the oak-studded valleys and hills of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's order would push Edelman's 3rd District westward through the mountains 
to the Ventura County line. Antonovich would also yield to Edelman much of his 
current base in the San Fernando Valley, including portions of the Simi hills. 
</P>
<P>
Dana and Antonovich, part of the Board of Supervisors' conservative majority, 
have received lavish support from real estate interests and have usually sided 
with them in development battles. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, while no "flaming environmentalist," in the words of one activist, has 
been more receptive to environmental concerns. In two recent cases, he cast the 
only dissenting votes on controversial projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Edelman has voted . . . our way more than any other supervisor," said David 
Brown, vice president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation and chairman of 
the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains task force. "He's tended to be the one 
supervisor who held out for reasonable planning," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state agency that acquires parkland in the mountains, said 
Edelman would be likely to take "a much more careful look at the cumulative 
impact" of development than Antonovich and Dana. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment "will make a difference for preservation of the mountains," 
said Barbara Fine, vice president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns., adding that she was not speaking on behalf of that organization. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five supervisors has a single vote, and redistricting would not 
change that. However, supervisors typically vote the wishes of the colleague in 
whose district a project is located. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, who was reelected in June to a four-year term, cannot be counted on 
"as a knee-jerk vote for anything," his press deputy, Joel Bellman, said. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been adamantly, inflexibly anti-development," said Bellman, "but I 
think it's fair to say he's been one of the more sensitive board members" to 
environmental and homeowner concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman alone has escaped the ire of critics who have accused the supervisors 
of undermining efforts to acquire lands needed to complete the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain park is struggling against tight budgets and soaring land prices. 
Critics, including some members of Congress, have accused the supervisors of 
inflating land prices by agreeing to "upzone" mountain property to allow more 
intensive development than county plans provide. The supervisors have said they 
are balancing the needs of the park with the rights of property owners to 
develop their land. 
</P>
<P>
A recent controversy involved the Paramount Ranch project, a proposed luxury 
housing development on an Agoura site that the government hoped to buy for the 
recreation area. The tract was zoned for 103 homes, and park supporters urged 
supervisors to hold the line there. This, they said, would reduce the project's 
impact on adjacent federal land and give the government a better chance to 
acquire it. With Edelman dissenting, the supervisors voted 3 to 1 last year to 
approve construction of 150 homes. 
</P>
<P>
In another case last December, Edelman dissented from the board's 4-1 approval 
of a controversial golf course, country club and housing development in Corral 
Canyon in Malibu. Bob Hope, owner of the tract, has since canceled the project 
as part of an effort to win support for his Jordan Ranch development in eastern 
Ventura County.

Today is the 62nd anniversary of the opening of the Ventura Theatre, originally 
a movie house, and now, of course, a concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
We asked Bill Detko, the theater's publicist, if there will be a celebration of 
some sort. "Probably not," he said. "We haven't in the past. I didn't even 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm is so low, in fact, that there isn't even a performance scheduled 
for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
This is in contrast to the first evening show in 1928, which featured an 
organist, an Our Gang film and several vaudeville acts. It sold out by 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of signs, there's a "Now Open" one hanging from the outside wall of 
the Ventura Hose-Man operation in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
What does the Hose-Man do? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we make hoses," said manager Walt Russ. They repair all kinds of hoses 
too -- fire hoses, gas hoses, steam hoses, even garden hoses. 
</P>
<P>
But more important, the Hose-Man joins an already impressive family of Ventura 
County businesses including Mr. Carpet Fresh, Mr. Forklift, Miss Secretary, Mr. 
Concrete and Ms. Wood Railing. 
</P>
<P>
Nathalie Gardner-Hamlat, who this year graduated from Rio Mesa High School, got 
some real hands-on (actually hands-off) experience this summer at the National 
Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
She had the opportunity to dissect a human hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to learn to respect the hand. We were told not to play with it. We had 
to dehumanize it," the aspiring pediatrician said. "You don't want to get 
emotionally attached to your hand." 
</P>
<P>
Is dissection something that Gardner-Hamlat enjoys doing? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, every night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems there has been a lot of educational traveling this summer. . . . A 
group of 36 students from Ventura College recently returned from a 2 1/2-week 
stay in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
While they were there they improved their Spanish and learned a lot about 
international business. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and they also discovered that the country's president, Rafael Calderon, is 
kind of a gnarly dude. 
</P>
<P>
"The students got to come into his private conference room and meet him," said 
Yvonne Gallegos Bodle, one of the two professors who made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the boys, Billy, proceeded to give him the surfers' handshake -- I died 
a thousand deaths -- and President Calderon proceeded to give it back to him."

LAYANA'S PLAY A BIG RELIEF TO REDS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FORMER LOYOLA MARYMOUNT STAR HAS BEEN A STEADY FORCE IN CINCINNATI'S 
BULLPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the summer of 1988, Tim Layana was digging deep into his wallet, hoping 
to find a little spare change. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he found inspiration -- which turned out to be worth a lot more in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Layana is a rookie middle-relief specialist for the Cincinnati 
Reds. He's earning the major league minimum of $100,000, so he doesn't need to 
dig for laundry money any more. 
</P>
<P>
But most importantly, the former Loyola Marymount ace has regained his 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
It was in short supply two summers ago when Layana was a struggling starting 
pitcher in the New York Yankees farm system. 
</P>
<P>
He was in debt, his signing bonus was all but gone, and his minor league salary 
was barely cutting it. 
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, Layana's control had vanished, taking his confidence with it. 
His earned-run average had ballooned over 6.00. And the Yankees had rewarded 
him with a demotion from triple-A Columbus to double-A Albany-Colonie. 
</P>
<P>
But when Layana burrowed through his wallet for some change that day in Albany, 
N.Y., he found a card he had buried inside it long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Written on the card is a poem called "Don't Quit." Layana used to read the 
words to pump himself up for games in college and high school. 
</P>
<P>
That card is now taped above his locker in the Reds' clubhouse at Riverfront 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Layana recited the opening words to the poem two weeks ago in the visiting 
locker room at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is queer with its twists and turns. . ." he said. "I remember those words 
any time I get down . . . the times when I'm struggling, when I'm sick of 
losing, when I can't throw strikes. That poem reminds me to just get out there 
and keep battling, even when the debts are high and funds are low." 
</P>
<P>
After Layana found those long-forgotten words of wisdom, his career took a turn 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 at Albany, Layana switched to the bullpen, where he could make the best 
use of his strikeout pitch, the knuckle-curve. 
</P>
<P>
He saved 17 games that season -- best in the Eastern League, and found himself 
in Yankee Stadium at the end of the year making a couple of cameo appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Layana got another boost in December, when the Yankees gambled and left him off 
their winter roster. The Reds, managed by former Yankee skipper Lou Pinella, 
were impressed enough with Layana's numbers that they snapped up the 
right-hander in that month's major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
For Layana, who had been shuffled around the Yankee farm system for four years, 
it was like going to heaven. He was placed on the Reds' spring training roster, 
and was still on the team on Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Layana finds himself in the middle of a pennant race, going into this 
week with a 4-0 record, a 2.47 ERA and a save. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yankees knew it was a risk, but the risk failed for the Yankees," Layana 
said. "From a personal standpoint, it's great. Look at where the Yankees are 
compared now to where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Layana doesn't have the notoriety of fellow relievers Rob Dibble, Randy Myers 
and Norm Charlton -- the Reds' self-styled fraternity who call themselves the 
"Nasty Boys." 
</P>
<P>
But as a solid middle reliever, Layana is one of the unsung heroes in the Reds' 
success story this season. Layana has four wins and a save and has yet to lose 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
He has been keeping the Reds in games when they are behind, giving the hitters 
time to make up the deficit. And he has pitched well when Cincinnati is leading 
by too many runs to warrant using one of the team's short relievers. 
</P>
<P>
Layana has proven he has the stuff to get out major league hitters. He has 34 
appearances, 51 innings pitched and National Leaguers are batting only .246 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Layana throws a fastball, a slider, a change-up, and of course, the 
knuckle-curve. Myers gave Layana the ultimate compliment early in the season 
when he said Layana's knuckle-curve was a "nasty" pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while, the Nasty Boys make me an honorary member," Layana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he concedes that he doesn't have the requisite personality to be a real 
Nasty Boy, which is probably for the better, since the Nasty Boys have become 
notorious more for their antics off the field than their performances on it. 
</P>
<P>
Layana is not eccentric like Myers, who has an eight-inch hunting knife 
sticking out of the wooden frame of his locker and who once drove a motorcycle 
into the Reds' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he have the temper of Dibble, who is known to throw bats and bean 
balls on the field and buckets of water over the heads of Cincinnati reporters 
off it. 
</P>
<P>
And Layana doesn't have the mean streak of Charlton, who leveled Dodger catcher 
Mike Scioscia -- baseball's premier plate blocker -- with a "nasty" 
forearm-and-shoulder block in a collision at home plate earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Layana is a quiet and serious 26-year-old -- a Loyola Marymount and 
Loyola High graduate who is going about his business in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just doing what I have to do to stay in the big leagues," Layana said. "If 
it's middle relief, long relief, whatever. Maybe someday I'll become a closer 
again, but I've got to establish myself on this level first." 
</P>
<P>
When he entered professional baseball in 1986, Layana was earmarked as a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City native was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in 1982 after a 
standout prep career at Loyola High in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After his first three years at Loyola Marymount, Layana was drafted again -- 
this time by the New York Mets. But he decided to pass up a contract for his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
It was a good move. Layana did the pitching and Chris Donnels and Billy Bean 
did the hitting to lead Loyola to the 1986 College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
In four years at Loyola Marymount, Layana set most of the school's career 
pitching records -- including marks for career victories, starts, innings 
pitched, complete games and strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
He signed with the Yankees after his senior season, having been selected in the 
third round of the June, 1986, draft. 
</P>
<P>
Layana was immediately successful at the class-A level that year. He had a 2.37 
ERA at Oneonta, N.Y. and a 2.24 ERA at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., that season. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, Layana's control began to unravel at Prince William, Va., Albany 
and Columbus. The struggles continued the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, those troubles are far behind. 
</P>
<P>
On April 10 this season, Layana picked up his first major league victory as the 
Red defeated the Houston Astros, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Layana worked two innings to beat the San Diego Padres. He picked 
up another victory against Pittsburgh on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
But Layana's biggest thrill of the season was yet to come. On June 23, Layana 
inherited an 11-5 lead against the visiting Dodgers and threw four 
near-flawless innings to record his first big league save. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Dodger Stadium so many times growing up and I'd be totally in awe 
just watching the players," Layana said. "I was a little nervous actually 
pitching against the Dodgers at first." 
</P>
<P>
Layana finally got a chance to pitch in Dodger Stadium on July 30, working a 
scoreless eighth inning in a 4-1 Reds' loss. He closed out that inning by 
striking out Rick Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
When the Reds travel to Los Angeles, Layana stays at home with his mother. His 
father has been overseas, working as a superintendent for a firm doing 
construction work in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Layana has emerged as a thorn in the Dodgers' sides. In three 
appearances against his old hometown favorites, Layana has allowed only one run 
over six innings and has struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
He's had only one really rough outing this season, that coming on July 12 
against the visiting New York Mets. The Reds trailed, 7-3, when Layana entered, 
but Layana gave up a two-run homer to the Mets' Kevin Elster in an eventual 
10-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Layana bounced back in his next appearance, going four innings four days later 
to beat the Montreal Expos, 8-3, to earn his fourth victory. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Reds will take whatever Layana can offer. After weathering a 
lengthy losing streak at the end of July, Cincinnati has seen its lead dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
"All teams are going to stumble at one time or another," Layana said. "At least 
we staggered in July instead of September."

Turnabout is fair play, so I guess I had it coming. When out-of-state visitors 
come to Southern California, I like to point out that almost every single tree 
they see was planted by the hand of man. I enjoy seeing the reactions of 
amazement my revelation provokes in folks who thought this was a naturally 
tropical paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Well, on a recent trip to France with my family, it was my turn to be amazed. 
We were driving out of Paris with our friend Adele Socier, who had visited us 
in Ventura and was taking us to her family's country house. Only a few minutes 
out of town, we were in the forest of Fontainebleau, and the kids exclaimed 
with delight at how woodsy it was so soon out of Paris. I was about to explain 
to them that France, unlike Southern California, is naturally woodsy. But Adele 
stopped me cold with an all-too-familiar remark: "Every tree you see was 
planted by the hand of man." 
</P>
<P>
How could that be? France is not a desert. "No, mon ami," said Adele, "but we 
almost turned into one." 
</P>
<P>
Here's Adele's story: 
</P>
<P>
Way back, when Caesar and the first out-of-state settlers arrived, they had a 
country two-thirds covered in woods. The newcomers and the nature-worshipping 
Gauls at first didn't do much damage with their bronze axes. But along about 
the first millennium, the French kings began to notice alarming changes in the 
scenery. These early NIMBYs (Not in My Back Yard, no-growth types) roped off 
Fontainebleau in France and Sherwood Forest in England about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
France had its own woodcutters who ignored the zoning laws and hacked down half 
the forests of France. Louis XIV tried to stop this and even initiated a major 
replanting program. 
</P>
<P>
But alas, we all know what happened apres Louis XIV. The "deluge" was a rain of 
hatchet blows, in this case. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the Revolutions, ours and theirs, they were down to a quarter of 
their original forests. And by the time Adele's father was born in 1908, they 
had only one in 10 of their original trees. The Dust Bowl had arrived in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
It seems they experienced then what we're going through nowadays in California. 
A no-growth, managed growth, environmentalist awakening. They passed laws, 
hired forestry inspectors and, with a mass determination we can only admire, 
set about henceforth and forever more to plant three trees for every one cut 
down. In the country, in the cities, the back yard, along the roadside. 
Everywhere. They kept this up despite world wars, depressions, governments left 
and right. 
</P>
<P>
The results, which Adele pointed out as we rode along, were wonderful. They've 
gotten back up to a third of their original forest cover. That's 50,000 square 
miles. In California, that would be like foresting the Mojave or planting every 
third acre in the state with trees. It occurred to me, as I listened to Adele, 
that, while it took a millennium to cut down the forest, it could be grown back 
in a century. There's hope. 
</P>
<P>
Respectful of the awesome story we had just heard, I didn't try to one-up Adele 
by talking about the work of the Tree People here in Southern California, so we 
bid her adieu at her destination. 
</P>
<P>
But, for us hereabouts, there is the matter of the Tree People -- a group 
that's organized the planting of a million trees in California. Andy and Katie 
Lipkis in a few weeks will bring us their story in a book with a long and lucid 
title: "The Simple Act of Planting a Tree: Healing Your Neighborhood, Your City 
and Your World." 
</P>
<P>
Tree People now will send speakers to Ventura County who will explain how to 
get involved. Whatever your degree of interest in the environment, whether it 
be the rain forests, the redwoods or urban and suburban blight, consider that, 
whatever hurdles we think we're facing here, there's news abroad that it can be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS: The Tree People Speaker's Bureau: (818) 753-4600, Paulette 
Dolin. The Lipkis' book, all royalties from which support the Tree People, can 
be ordered by calling (800) 325-5225 or can be purchased at the Ventura 
Bookstore -- which also has Mary Davis' book "Environmentalist's Guide to 
France," my source for corroborating the saga in this column.

THE GREEN DRAGON'S PROPRIETORS ENCOURAGE THEIR PATRONS TO ESPRESSO THEMSELVES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin Germaine, a sculptor, is lanky, contemplative and inclined to drape 
himself over a chunk of Douglas fir and pronounce it "my baby." 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Lach, inclined to watch and grin as he does that, was most recently a 
retail consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But since last October, both have trained their attention upon the creation and 
sustenance of the Green Dragon Art Studio and Espresso Bar at 22 W. Mission St. 
in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to create a place for coffee, conversation and aesthetics, 
building upon the tradition of the original Green Dragon coffeehouse in Boston, 
which is said to have served revolutionaries and others from 1697 to 1832. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is now open daily from 7 a.m. to midnight, an organic coffeehouse 
that offers cappuccino and espresso without traces of pesticide, a gallery that 
puts new artworks on display every Saturday and a performance schedule that 
includes Nigerian drummers welcoming each full moon. Coffee costs 75 cents, 
cappuccino is $1 and Argentine mate is $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style building has high, beamed ceilings and an eventful history. 
Early in this century, it housed the Flying A movie studio; later, an Episcopal 
church. On a Wednesday afternoon early this month, the walls were crowded with 
watercolors, oils and photographs, representative and abstract, by 14 artists. 
</P>
<P>
One of the artists, encouraged by the proprietors to hang around while his work 
was doing the same, sat sketching on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about pushing the creative edge for people," said Germaine, "so that 
they're personally transformed out of the experience." 
</P>
<P>
On a more practical level? 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to cut out the middle man." 
</P>
<P>
Until late last year, Germaine was living in rural Bucks County, Pa., and 
selling his wood sculpture through big city galleries that he said took 
commissions as high as 50%. Now "people see my work, they touch it, and I see 
them," said Germaine. "It feeds me." 
</P>
<P>
Germaine, 35, and Lach, 23, met at the Whole Life Expo in Los Angeles in 
February, 1989. She was from Boulder, Colo., but within three days they were 
nosing around Santa Barbara together, contemplating an alliance that would 
marry her entrepreneurial background to his aesthetic sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
They went back to Pennsylvania, subscribed to the Santa Barbara newspaper and, 
in September, found a classified ad for the building on West Mission Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was a unique space," said Gregg Petty, the Green Dragon's landlord. 
"We had a children's symphony orchestra that wanted to take the space on for 
the sound quality, so I considered them. And there was a meditation group. But 
if you've talked with Edwin, you've picked up that there's a persuasiveness 
about him, and it's not subtle. He loves what he does. I just sensed that there 
was a tenacity about him." 
</P>
<P>
In October, Lach and Germaine signed a lease. In January, they weremarried, in 
a non-commercial sense, beneath redwoods in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the month, Germaine was "networking" at Santa Barbara Rotary 
breakfasts. His brown hair cascaded far beyond his collar, but he had a tie 
around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
The two opened the new Green Dragon to the public in March. They had one 
part-time employee, who poured drinks into paper cups because they couldn't 
afford anything else. A month later, they scraped up money for glasses and 
mugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was receiving his rent in $1 bills from espresso coffee," Petty said. "They 
were handing me two-inch stacks of bills. He's one of these guys who doesn't 
believe in living beyond his means, so he didn't want to live on credit. . . . 
This month was the first check I've received." 
</P>
<P>
Now the part-time staff has grown to five, and a rented piano stands ready for 
impromptu performances. The operation is not in the black yet, Lach said, "but 
it's moving in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
The next challenge, she said, is luring more art buyers into the Dragon's den. 
Lach and Germaine, who take a 20% commission on art sales, estimated that about 
30 works have been sold so far. To enhance the space's studio feel and attract 
the best artists, they said, they need more customers with both art savvy and 
disposable income. 
</P>
<P>
It would take a fair chunk of disposable income to buy a piece of Germaine's 
own work, technically accomplished carvings, many of which began as remainder 
wood from lumberyards. His prices begin at about $1,200, too much for any of 
the Green Dragon's clients so far. 
</P>
<P>
But Germaine offered no complaints on the aesthetic front. After 10 months at 
work in the world of commerce, he announced he finally found time to start his 
first West Coast work. 
</P>
<P>
It was a hunk of Douglas fir, about 3 1/2 feet high, roughly carved in the 
shape of a man cradling a precious object, the way a fullback cradles a 
football. It needed, the artist said, another 20 hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
Germaine draped himself over it. "My baby," he said. Lach watched and grinned.

Every now and then, Peter Letwaba would stop in mid-sentence to exclaim, "This 
is wonderful, wonderful." Then he'd shift from one leg to the other, do a 
little sidestep and sometimes walk in a circle to try and diffuse his 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend and I went to a restaurant a couple of days ago," he said. "And we 
walked in and sat down, and we ate. No one asked me what I was doing there. No 
one told me to get out. This is wonderful, wonderful," he said with a slight 
jig to the left. 
</P>
<P>
A black man from South Africa, 20-year-old Letwaba said he is unaccustomed to 
such freedoms. "I feel like a new person here. I am acting differently. I feel 
I am in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Letwaba and 45 other students from around the world arrived in Santa Barbara 
almost two weeks ago to participate in the second annual International Peace 
Camp. A dinner and show is scheduled Sunday, and the group will put on a 
musical performance Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy by which the camp operates is: If young people learn that 
children of other cultures are much like themselves, they will grow into adults 
who feel a bond with people throughout the world. And they will be predisposed 
to peace and unity. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that if people, not only blacks and whites but people from all 
different countries, could get together in their youth and share their ideas, 
then we could find solutions to the world's problems," Letwaba said. 
</P>
<P>
"If people would get to know each other, then everyone would know we are all 
one family. There is nothing to be frightened of." 
</P>
<P>
To this end, this year's international students from South Africa, China, the 
Soviet Union, the Philippines, Mexico, Peru, Zimbabwe and France will spend 
three weeks at the camp getting to know one another, listening to lectures and 
learning about each other's culture. And rehearsing for the upcoming musical. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 14 students and four adults from Latvia will stage a show of 
traditional music and dance Sunday. As well as the performance, Saturday's 
event is "A Trip Around the World," offering cuisine and entertainment from the 
countries represented at this year's peace camp. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 25, the entire group will perform a musical directed by Vladislav 
Drudzinin, president of the Children's International Academy of Arts in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Underground Story" is a musical fantasy with a message or two. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main purpose at the camp is to learn from and teach to each other," said 
Brooke Robbins, the 17-year-old daughter of the camp's founder, Virginia 
Robbins. "But the musical is a great vehicle for us to get our message out to 
the public. The environment and peace are very important to all of us, but most 
people don't want to sit around and hear a speech about it. So we give them 
entertainment as well." 
</P>
<P>
"A Trip Around the World" will run from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday at Middle School, 
2300 Garden St., Santa Barbara. Tickets are $20. 
</P>
<P>
"Underground Story," a fantasy musical, will be performed Aug. 25 at 2:30 and 8 
p.m. at Santa Barbara High School, 700 E. Anapamu St. Tickets are $6, and $4.50 
for children and seniors. For information on either event, call 966-3657. 
</P>
<P>
While some people in Santa Barbara celebrate world peace, others may be 
considering some heavy shopping, as Nordstrom and the Broadway hold their grand 
openings Saturday. They are the first two stores to open at the city's new 
Paseo Nuevo open-air mall, located between Ortega and Canon Perdido streets off 
State Street. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, always a stickler for aesthetics, has insisted that all 
buildings blend in with the town's Spanish colonial-style architecture. Years 
ago, the downtown McDonald's wasn't even allowed to put up its golden arches. 
And the city is so protective of its "artsy" ambience that the new shopping 
center will house an arts complex with a gallery and a theater. 
</P>
<P>
The opening play at the 150-seat, "black box" theater is "The Boys Next Door." 
This comedy, which examines the lives of four men who share an apartment for 
developmentally disabled individuals, will open Friday and run through Sept. 9. 
Tickets are $14.50.

A Superior Court judge in a child-custody suit has ordered the mother of a 
5-year-old boy not to smoke in the child's presence with their home. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David Stirling issued the order after the boy's father, Manfred Kallweit, 
complained that smoking by Anna Maria De Benzi Souza poses health risks to 
their son. Kallweit, who shares custody of the boy, asked Stirling to impose 
the smoking ban after De Benzi Souza petitioned for sole custody. De Benzi 
Souza, who described herself as a light smoker, questioned the court's right to 
dictate her behavior in her home. "This is not Russia, right?" she asked. A 
tobacco industry spokesman said he will ask lawyers to look into Stirling's 
ruling.

BROWN REVISES PLAN TO POLICE LAWYERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Besieged by complaints from consumer interests and questions from state 
senators, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown agreed to water down a series of 
proposals that critics said would have weakened the state's lawyer disciplinary 
system. Brown, a San Francisco Democrat who was once subjected to an 
investigation by the California State Bar but absolved of any wrongdoing, had 
proposed changes that consumer interests believed would have eroded reforms put 
in place two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly controversial was Brown's proposal that complaints against lawyers 
be filed under penalty of perjury. Several senators argued that would 
discourage those with legitimate concerns from seeking disciplinary action. 
Brown agreed to instead give the Bar authority to notify district attorneys 
when people knowingly file false complaints. He also changed a proposal that 
would have required the Bar to keep all investigations confidential to one that 
would allow officials to disclose an investigation when it was necessary to 
protect consumers.

Santa Clara County is moving into the final stage of its yearlong fight against 
an infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. The last of nearly 800 million 
sterile Medflies were released from the Mountain View area last Friday, and 
about 1,200 new traps have been hung throughout the 65-square-mile quarantine 
area. If no fertile Medflies are trapped in the next few weeks, the quarantine 
that has blocked the shipment of fruits and vegetables from the area could be 
lifted by mid-September, said Greg Van Wassenhove, the county's agricultural 
commissioner.

Concentrations of copper, which is toxic to fish and other marine life, exceed 
federal standards throughout most of San Francisco Bay, the San Francisco 
Regional Water Quality Control Board said. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities have long been aware that pollutants have exceeded federal 
standards at specific locations in the bay, the study marked the first time 
that high background levels have been found to be widespread. The study drew 
water samples in April, August and December of 1989. The federal standard for 
copper is 2.9 parts per billion. Levels as high as 7.2 p.p.b. were recorded.

Faced with the possible relocation of the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El

Air Force officials, who announced earlier this year that the base is one of

A group of East Los Angeles residents have begun a petition drive to recall

The Committee to Recall Richard Alatorre has 120 days to collect 9,484 
signatures of registered voters living in Alatorre's 14th District in order to 
force a recall election, according to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre suggested that those leading the recall attempt may have political 
aspirations. "Look, you're always going to have people who are not going to be 
happy, who have their own political agenda," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
If the recall drive qualifies for the ballot, the timetable would require a 
special election between Feb. 26 and March 28, 1991, shortly before the regular 
April city election in which seven council seats -- including Alatorre's -- 
will be contested.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY FUNDS POLICING OF BUSES IN CRIME AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved the financing of a pilot program 
Wednesday to beef up security on Southern California Rapid Transit District 
buses that travel through the city's high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote freed up $421,000 from a city fund earmarked for 
transportation matters to finance a one-year program in which transit police 
will either ride on or follow designated buses. 
</P>
<P>
The program is similar to one approved last year by the County Board of 
Supervisors for an unincorporated section of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The program calls for seven transit police officers to be used where needed 
based on crime statistics compiled by police and the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, there were four murders, 87 assaults and 300 incidents of burglary and 
robbery on public buses in the city, most of which were centered in south and 
southwest sections of the city, police records show.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MANHOLE COVER THIEF SENTENCED TO 180 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two men who pleaded guilty to stealing hundreds of manhole covers, storm 
drain gates and water meter covers to sell for scrap metal was sentenced 
Wednesday to 180 days in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Efrain Deleon Barrios, 19, was also placed on three years formal probation by 
Superior Court Judge James Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendant, Antonio Lopez, 23, is to be sentenced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two pleaded guilty earlier this month to two counts of receiving stolen 
property and one count of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios and Lopez were arrested July 18 on suspicion of stealing manhole 
covers, storm drain grates and water meter covers in Los Angeles, Beverly 
Hills, Santa Monica and Vernon. Authorities said the pair stole the objects 
during a nine-day spree to sell for scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
Officers confiscated more than 300 covers and grates weighing about a ton, 
which the two were about to sell for $75, police said.

GUNMAN STEALS UNMARKED CAR FROM TWO FBI AGENTS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ASSAILANT POINTS AN ASSAULT RIFLE AT OFFICERS AND ORDERS THEM OUT OF 
VEHICLE. NO ONE IS HARMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman packing a military assault rifle stole an undercover FBI car early 
Wednesday, forcing two federal agents away from the Mustang convertible as they 
sat talking near a Westchester fast-food restaurant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police issued a statewide all-points bulletin to law enforcement agencies about 
the car, an unmarked black 1990 model that was equipped with "at least one 
shotgun" and also may have carried information about ongoing FBI cases. 
</P>
<P>
Neither FBI agent was harmed during the incident near a McDonald's in 
Westchester, according to Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth. He said the 
agents had parked in separate cars and were talking when the gunman approached 
about 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said the agents "were able to evade" the gunman without shots being 
fired, but he would not elaborate on how they escaped harm. 
</P>
<P>
A news service account of the episode quoted Sgt. Greg Correa of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division as saying that one agent ran away 
and leaped over a fence when the gunman pointed the assault rifle at him. The 
gunman then ordered the second agent out of the Mustang, jumped in and sped 
off, Correa said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Reagan, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, refused to comment on the car 
theft. "We have a law enforcement reason for not making a statement and we're 
not going to make one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators believe the gunman and an accomplice drove up to the 
agents in a black-topped gold 1979 Toyota Celica, a two-door sedan that had 
recently been stolen in Compton, Booth said. The gunman jumped out, 
commandeered the FBI's Mustang, then roared off with the Toyota following close 
behind. The Mustang was last seen heading east on Century Boulevard, away from 
Westchester, but authorities refused to report the exact location. 
</P>
<P>
The license plate of the Mustang is 2SKB931, and the Toyota's is 2LEL769, Booth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang was fitted with a radio, cellular telephone and "at least one gun, 
probably more. At least a shotgun," Booth said. He refused to detail what else 
was in the car. 
</P>
<P>
The wire-service report said the FBI car contained three handguns, a shotgun, 
the agent's badge and information on active FBI cases. 
</P>
<P>
Booth asked that anyone with information on the FBI car should call the 911 
emergency number to report it.

RAIDERS GET NEW COLISEUM OFFER; DAVIS DECISION MAY BE NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: MAYOR BRADLEY CALLED A CITY HALL MEETING TO ENCOURAGE THE TEAM TO 
ACCEPT THE LATEST DEAL PROPOSED BY THE ARENA'S PRIVATE MANAGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new offer by the Los Angeles Coliseum's private managers to keep the Raiders 
playing football in the facility was made to team owner Al Davis this week at a 
time when those privy to the discussions believe Davis may at last be about 
ready to make up his mind between Los Angeles and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's at the moment of truth," said one participant in a meeting that 
took place Monday at City Hall in the presence of both Davis and Mayor Tom 
Bradley. The participant spoke Wednesday, as did all other sources, on 
condition that they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley called the meeting to encourage the Raiders to accept the new offer by 
Spectacor Management Group, and after it was over one source said: 
</P>
<P>
"I think Davis will take this. . . . He sounded calm. He didn't talk in the 
staccato fashion he usually does. It seemed like he felt he wasn't in a trap. I 
think this deal flies." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has a contract to play in the Coliseum through 1991, did not return 
a call for comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders owner has in hand a $127-million offer from Oakland with a 
September deadline for acceptance or rejection. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if he is going to remain in Los Angeles, sources believe he 
may want to say so in advance of the beginning of the National Football League 
regular season games next month. Such an announcement would be expected to 
buttress season ticket sales, which have lagged this summer because of 
uncertainty about the team's future. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Spectacor would pay $20 million to the Raiders before 
Coliseum renovations were complete, and $10 million of this would come before 
the proposed renovations had even been subject to an environmental impact 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The advance payments would be entirely in private funds. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Irwindale's advance payment of $10 million to the Raiders in 1987, 
which was forfeited after its failure to bring together financing and land for 
a Raiders stadium there, the Raiders would have to agree to indemnify Spectacor 
in some way if the Coliseum renovation does not come together. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that if the $100-million-plus Coliseum renovation were to 
founder as a result of problems with environmentalists or historic 
preservationists, or if Davis were to decide in the meantime to move the team 
elsewhere, then the Raiders would have to take Spectacor with them as managers 
of their new stadium in some other city, or be required to repay most of the 
advance money over a period of years. 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor earlier had balked at making large advance payments to Davis on 
grounds it could lose all its money if obstacles arose over which it would have 
no control. 
</P>
<P>
Other details of the new offer to the Raiders were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Spectacor chief Ed Snider have expressed confidence that the 
Coliseum renovation -- calling for luxury boxes, thousands of club seats and 
moving the Coliseum seating closer to the field -- would clear all hurdles and 
be ready for construction by the end of the 1991 playing season. 
</P>
<P>
It has previously been stated by both Bradley and Coliseum commissioners that, 
aside from a $15-million loan of Coliseum funds for the renovation, it would be 
financed privately. 
</P>
<P>
The $15-million loan would come from funds the Coliseum Commission received in 
damages from the National Football League as a result of the Raider-Coliseum 
Commission suit against the league for impeding the Raiders' move from Oakland 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present at Bradley's meeting Monday were representatives of USC, 
the other major Coliseum tenant, and labor leader Bill Robertson, whom Bradley 
reappointed to the Coliseum Commission recently to help facilitate a new Raider 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said they now have the impression that Davis will return to Oakland 
only if he is convinced that Los Angeles interests are incapable of coming up 
with an acceptable offer. 
</P>
<P>
They said Davis' reply to the latest offer could come as early as this week. 
But such optimism in the past has often not been borne out during the complex 
negotiations that have continued sporadically for more than a year.

MUM'S THE WORD FROM HEAT COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McCLOUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Sibbald isn't talking. 
</P>
<P>
The coach of the Los Angeles Heat lashed out at the media earlier this week and 
said he will refuse to speak to reporters during the coming American 
Professional Soccer League West playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald's actions are believed to have been triggered by: 
</P>
<P>
* Recent reports that he has missed practices due to commitments with his 
full-time job as a salesman for a hair products company. 
</P>
<P>
* A Times reporter's interpretation of what appeared to be a shoving match 
between Sibbald and a player who was cut soon after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
* A report in The Times that team President John Ajemian has announced that the 
Heat will leave the South Bay to play in Orange County in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald, calling the reports negative publicity, questioned the intentions of 
the Times reporter, who is also a youth soccer coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you can say you like soccer when you write negative things 
(about it)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if his blackout was directed at a specific news outlet, Sibbald 
responded: "I'm not talking to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald deferred comments to Heat General Manager Jill Fracisco, assistant 
coach John Britton or the players. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fracisco: "Bobby is an Englishman. He is very superstitious, maybe because 
of his background in the sport (as a professional player in England and the 
United States). He's gearing up for the playoffs. That's the way he gets before 
a big game. And he is very closed-door. He keeps more to himself." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald's outburst comes at time when the second-place Heat appears to have 
shaken out of its season-long malaise and is beginning to live up to billing as 
the most talented team in the APSL West.PAUL McCLOUD

Sportfishing boats continue to find success in the kelp 10 to 14 miles 
offshore. Anglers report catching several species of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Dorado and yellowtail counts continue to climb and now tuna and skipjack have 
been on the move. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game, which keep records from party boats' daily 
catch counts, reports that more than 6,000 dorado have been caught since a run 
started last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dream Street Foundation of West L.A., which provides summer camp programs 
for boys and girls with life-threatening diseases, introduced 60 youngsters to 
ocean sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. George Xenio donated his boat, the Victory, the crew and all the fishing 
equipment for the trip. Conditions were perfect as a run of big barracuda and 
bonito kept the youngsters busy for three hours. The trip's organizer, Linda 
Giella, said it was an experience that youngsters will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
John Maur of San Pedro reeled in several bonito that weighed up to eight pounds 
and Crystal Flores of Carson reeled in a 10-pound barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
An official international game fish scale has been installed at the Union 76 
fuel dock in Marina del Rey. Marina del Rey anglers installed the weigh station 
that will be open to all anglers. Ron Worthington will be the official weigh 
master. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Milener, 11, of Carson has been deep sea fishing since he was 5 and had 
never caught an exotic fish until last weekend. Fishing aboard L.A. Harbor's 
Sportking, Milener hooked 10 fighting dorado that weighed up to 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing's Blackjack was at the 209 spot fishing the floating kelp 
for dorado and yellowtail when angler Ernie Kaplan of West Los Angeles noticed 
a marlin jumping nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Using 15-pound test line and a small sardine for bait, he cast toward the 
marlin and hooked it. Kaplan headed the fish toward the boat and within 15 
minutes brought it to gaff. It weighed in at 90 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
King Harbor Marlin Club members with some impressive catches this past week 
were Frank Matsuhara, fishing on the Rowena III 28 miles out from San Diego. He 
caught a yellowfin that weighed 34 pounds 7 ounces. Bob Stephens, fishing 10 
miles out from King Harbor for sharks, caught a 71-pound mako. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Bay angler Brian Merrell reeled in a 30-pound leopard shark. 
</P>
<P>
David Zeitlin of West Los Angeles was fishing Santa Monica Bay for halibut and 
caught the whopper of the week -- a 35-pounder. Roger Kurmoto of Torrance, 
fishing aboard the Shogun off Santa Catalina Island, caught a 28-pound 
yellowtail.

First String. Bob Gunderson of Hermosa Beach, fishing at the rigs aboard the 
Hitless Miss, caught a 12 1/4 pound bonito. 
</P>
<P>
Local fishing for bonito and barracuda in all areas is rated good. Sand bass 
catches slowed during the days with the twilight trips being the best bet. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire, on a twilight trip to the flats, 
returned with 145 sand bass and 36 bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman half-day trip resulted in a catch of 145 bonito and seven 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod trip to the rocky reefs returned with 145 rock cod, two 
cow cod and a ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Seaspray worked rocky point and anglers sacked 175 
bonito, 42 sand bass, four barracuda and a yellowtail.

FAVORITISM CLAIMS IN TEXAS S&amp;L PROBE STIR UP WASHINGTON;

THRIFTS: THE CONDUCT OF FIGURES INVOLVED IN THE SOUTHWEST PLAN SELLOFF IS BEING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One afternoon in the summer of 1988, six angry federal regulators in Dallas 
walked into their supervisor's office to complain that some bidders were 
getting special treatment in a then-new U.S. program to sell insolvent Texas 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the meeting was in the afternoon," one participant recalls, 
"because we spent all morning getting up the courage to go in there." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, buyers of the Texas S&amp;Ls in 1988 received concessions that will 
cost the taxpayers at least $52 billion, according to government estimates. 
Several of them were big contributors to the Republican Party, and one was 
represented by a former aide to then-Vice President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But today, those 1988 deals are more than the subject of anxiety among some 
regulators in Texas. Now, what was supposed to be the cleanup of the savings 
and loan fiasco threatens to turn into a political firestorm. Moreover, unlike 
the collapse of the thrift industry itself, the fallout from the mishandling of 
the rescue effort may land entirely on the White House and the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part of the savings and loan crisis, in a political sense, is the 
Southwest Plan deals," said Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, 
Va., who was an early and persistent critic of the government's handling of the 
bailouts. "They were rotten deals at the time. They are costing the taxpayers a 
bundle. And they are going to be a political bombshell." 
</P>
<P>
A case in point -- and the object of the regulators' complaints two summers ago 
-- was Thomas J. Lykos. A hard-charging young lawyer with no experience in real 
estate or banking but lots of political clout, Lykos, at 31, had been made the 
point man in the government's ambitious -- and, some argue, flawed -- program 
to offer billions of dollars in cash assistance and tax benefits to investors 
who were willing to acquire failed thrifts in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Lykos oversaw 15 transactions involving the sale of 87 failed thrifts 
in a frenzied attempt by regulators to ease the deepening S&amp;L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those special deals are now under investigation by the FBI, which is 
looking for evidence of favoritism and high-level influence-peddling. Democrats 
in Congress have criticized the arrangements as too generous. And regulators in 
Washington are reviewing the bidding procedures and costs in all of the 1988 
bailouts, with a view toward opening them anew and negotiating better deals for 
the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have declined to identify any deals under investigation, and no one has 
been accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
While Lykos has not emerged as a central figure in the $500 billion 
savings-and-loan debacle -- and has not been accused of any wrongdoing -- the 
spotlight has begun to shine on the young Texan who jumped from a political 
post on Capitol Hill to negotiating billion-dollar deals with the nation's 
shrewdest lawyers and investment bankers on behalf of the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him (Lykos) as being someone who was untouchable as far as any 
wrongdoing, and I had absolute confidence in his integrity and toughness," says 
M. Danny Wall, the nation's top thrift regulator in 1988 and the person who 
hired Lykos. 
</P>
<P>
But others, speaking with the promise of anonymity, claim Lykos exerted too 
much influence in deciding who won the lucrative bailout deals. Lykos did not 
return telephone calls placed to the Dallas brokerage house where he now works, 
and his attorney said he has advised him not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lykos, a Houston native, was graduated from Harvard University and earned a law 
degree at the University of Texas in Austin in 1981. He worked briefly for a 
Houston-based law firm and later for the Securities and Exchange Commission 
before joining the Republican staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty much sent in to keep an eye on us for the Republicans on 
securities stuff," says a Democratic staffer on the committee, who described 
Lykos as friendly and sensible. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lykos moved to the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee 
as a lawyer under the sponsorship of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), a close 
ally of the securities industry. His boss on the committee was Wall. 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic staffer there recalls Lykos most clearly for a memo he wrote 
attacking a bill on corporate takeovers proposed by then-Sen. William Proxmire 
(D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
"Generally criticisms are polite up here, but Lykos delivered this ad hominem 
attack accusing Proxmire of having -- and I remember the exact words -- 'an 
infirm grasp of reality,' " the staffer says. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, President Ronald Reagan appointed Wall chairman of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board, which then regulated the S&amp;L industry. The job put 
him in charge of trying to stop the industry's nationwide collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The federal insurance fund for S&amp;Ls was bankrupt, so there was not enough 
money to pay off depositors and shut down insolvent institutions. As a result, 
hopelessly sick institutions were kept open and became known as "zombies." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of zombies littered the financial landscape of Texas, where the crisis 
was deepest, and finding a way to revive or kill them became a paramount 
concern at the bank board in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The solution that the regulators devised was to be called the Texas Plan, 
according to several insiders, but was later renamed the Southwest Plan to 
avoid focusing all the attention on Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The concept was to package failed thrifts in groups and offer them to bidders. 
In exchange for investing some money to get the thrifts going again, the 
government would provide buyers with cash assistance and tax benefits spread 
out over several years. 
</P>
<P>
The tax benefits were a particular lure, because they would enable a business 
to shelter income from other operations. As a result, powerful businessmen and 
major corporations began to eye the Texas deals. The hitch was that since the 
benefits were to be eliminated by Congress at the end of 1988, the sales had to 
be completed by year-end for the buyer to qualify for the writeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Plan was approved in February, 1988, and in April, Wall hired 
Lykos to head the operation. Handing such a critical job to someone so young 
and inexperienced in the field surprised many Senate staffers. But Wall 
defended the choice in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Southwest Plan deals were mergers-and-acquisitions kinds of transactions 
and he had that kind of background," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary negotiations were already under way on the first six deals when 
Lykos began shuttling between Dallas and Washington in his new post. In 
testimony before a Senate subcommittee last week, Lykos described his job as 
overseeing the preparation of bid packages on the deals and keeping the bank 
board up to date on negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not my responsibility to evaluate or choose who would bid and who the 
ultimate successful bidder would be," he testified. "The responsibility . . . 
was that of the negotiating teams and ultimately the bank board, which was 
composed of a chairman and two board members." 
</P>
<P>
A former high-ranking official with the bank board in Washington, however, says 
Lykos played a far more influential role in determining winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Lykos' attitude was that whatever he decided would be a good deal to propose 
to the board should just be rubber-stamped by the board," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The six analysts evaluating Southwest Plan packages in Dallas soon came to 
believe that Lykos was playing a major role by favoring certain bidders and 
excluding others without proper grounds, according to two of the analysts. Near 
the middle of the summer in 1988, all six walked into the office of David 
Bradley, their supervisor, and complained about Lykos. 
</P>
<P>
Two participants described the meeting on the condition that their names not be 
used in this article, on grounds that they still work for the government and 
very likely would lose their jobs if their identities were known. Through a 
spokesman, Bradley declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Bradley that we weren't going to make up reasons why people weren't 
going to get these deals," said one of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
Both said Bradley had little reaction, but they said their role in evaluating 
bids was cut back soon after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Wall says he never heard of the session, adding: "I have no idea why they would 
have felt that way." 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Stallings, a Phoenix businessman who lost bids for two Southwest Plan 
deals, praises Lykos as a smart regulator and says he saw no evidence of 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't suffer fools lightly, and he really put the pressure on to get 
deals closed. I get the feeling he probably rubbed some people the wrong way," 
Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
Some losing bidders complained to the bank board, and an audit by the board's 
inspector general's office in 1989 raised a question about Lykos' explanation 
for his actions in one transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Senate subcommittee last week, said Lykos justified 
his dismissal of one bid on grounds that it was "expensive" at a time when 
regulators had not completed their analysis of its ultimate cost. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that action and others by Lykos and his subordinates, the 
inspector general concluded in the report: "Competition . . . was restricted," 
denying "at least two qualified investors . . . sufficient time to prepare 
complete proposals." 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 report prepared by the Mid-America Institute for the bank board 
concluded that the 1988 deals were riddled with errors and complications that 
made it extremely difficult for the government to evaluate competing bids. One 
result was that the wrong people may have won the bids, said the report. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the winners in the Southwest Plan were big contributors to the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Dedman, a Dallas businessman and chairman of the Texas Highway 
Commission, obtained three Austin thrifts in September, 1988. The month before, 
he and his wife each contributed $5,000 to a Republican congressional committee 
in Texas, and both had previously contributed the maximum $1,000 each to the 
Bush presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Dedman could have been disqualified as an acquirer under federal regulations 
because a small number of businesses associated with his company, Club Corp. 
International, had declared bankruptcy. An analyst in Dallas says that when he 
raised the bankruptcy issue, Lykos defended Dedman saying, "He's a successful 
businessman." 
</P>
<P>
The bank board was alerted to the bankruptcies but approved the deal because 
the problems affected only a fraction of Dedman's businesses, Wall says. Dedman 
did not return telephone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas-based developer Trammell Crow, who contributed $120,000 to the 
Republican National Committee in 1988, received a 9.9% interest in a group of 
thrifts, although companies associated with him had defaulted on loans at other 
savings and loans -- traditionally another reason for disqualification. But the 
rule only affects people with an interest of 10% or more and therefore did not 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most controversial Southwest Plan deals involved the sale of 15 
thrifts to Phoenix insurance man James M. Fail, who borrowed $70 million. In 
return, Fail received benefits of as much as $3 billion for the thrifts, which 
were consolidated and renamed Bluebonnet Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Fail was represented by Washington lobbyist Robert Thompson, who had been an 
aide to George Bush when Bush was vice president. Thompson and Fail both told 
the Senate panel they did nothing improper in connection with the transaction, 
which Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) has criticized. 
</P>
<P>
In his recent appearance before the Senate panel, Lykos said he had no contact 
with Thompson during negotiations on the deal. But he acknowledged that he 
provided Thompson with a confidential copy of an internal government report 
that criticized the transaction. The arrangement allowed Thompson to propose 
revisions to a draft of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Weston Edwards, the losing bidder on Bluebonnet, declined to comment about 
Lykos. But Edwards said he now suspects that political connections provided the 
winning edge to many bidders. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone close to the Administration was pushing this, (the regulators) 
broke their own rules and obviously pushed and expedited these things," Edwards 
said in an interview.

Insurer Backs Down: ITT Hartford Insurance Group said it would continue to 
write auto insurance policies, bowing to a threat from New Jersey state 
officials. ITT was attempting to withdraw from the New Jersey auto insurance 
market in reaction to Gov. Jim Florio's auto insurance reforms. The program 
forces the industry to pay nearly half of a $3-billion debt incurred by a 
state-run pool that covers high-risk drivers.

Point Arguello Intermediary Appointed: Energy Secretary James D. Watkins 
appointed an intermediary to work with oil companies and Santa Barbara County 
officials to speed up the process of permitting oil production at the Point 
Arguello offshore field, which sits idle despite completion two years ago. The 
unusual move was prompted by the Middle East crisis, which has focused new 
attention on domestic sources of oil. In a letter to county officials, Watkins 
named Stephen Wakefield, general counsel with the Energy Department, to 
mediate.

Mexico Guilty of 'Dumping' Cement: The U.S. International Trade Commission has 
imposed higher import duties on Mexican cement after finding that Cementos 
Mexicanos (Cemex) and other manufacturers were guilty of "dumping" cement on 
the U.S. market at artificially low prices. According to government estimates, 
Mexico exported $111 million in gray portland cement and clinker, the two 
concrete components covered by the ruling. Cemex has said it will appeal the

VOLKSWAGEN PLANS DESIGN FACILITY IN SIMI VALLEY

<P>
Volkswagen of America Inc. plans to open its first American auto design center 
in Simi Valley, a VW spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Fitzgerald, a spokesman at the company's headquarters in Troy, Mich., said 
the company already has signed a lease for property in the Simi Valley Business 
Center on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
But he declined further comment, saying details were being withheld until a 
formal announcement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a unit of Volkswagen AG of West Germany, would join General Motors 
Corp. and major Japanese auto makers such as Toyota and Honda in establishing 
design centers in California. Another West German car maker, Mercedes-Benz, has 
also announced plans to open a design facility in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Most industries believe that California is a trend-setting market" and 
therefore "a good place to sit back and watch just what's happening in the 
marketplace," said Chris Cedergren, an analyst with the auto marketing research 
firm of J. D. Power &amp; Associates in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
VW's U.S. sales this year are flat. The company sold 80,200 vehicles through 
July this year, compared to 80,344 a year ago, according to J. D. Power. VW's 
Audi division sold 12,645 vehicles through July, up slightly from 11,970 a year 
earlier.

MONROVIA TRIES 'POP' AS WEAPON IN DRUG FIGHT

<P>
For at least one night, there were no drugs changing hands on the 100 block of 
West Montana Avenue, just lollipops and balloons. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of busting dealers, police served cookies and punch. And rather than 
seeking shelter at sunset, residents of this crime-plagued street sat in their 
front yards soaking it all up. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's call it a celebration and also a declaration of war," Mayor Bob Bartlett 
told the cheering crowd of 100 that filled the street last Thursday evening. 
"If you're a drug dealer or user, this is probably the time to pack up and go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
The block party was the high point so far in the city's new attack on crime, 
dubbed "Problem Oriented Policing." Under the "POP" philosophy, which began in 
February, officers are expected to serve as social activists, teaming up with 
other city departments and community agencies to address the causes of crime, 
Police Chief Joseph Santoro said. 
</P>
<P>
Montana Avenue, the fourth location in the city to be targeted under the 
approach, had become one of Monrovia's busiest centers for cocaine dealing, 
Santoro said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers came from as far away as San Bernardino and Orange counties. Officers 
videotaped their transactions in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
But a closer inspection of the block revealed that drugs were not the only 
problem, the chief said. Numerous residents were living in substandard units, 
where electrical outlets were exposed, cockroaches ran free and plumbing 
frequently backed up. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants in one apartment were forced to shower outside with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, it becomes an acceptable way of living," Santoro said. "You get 
the feeling that nobody can do anything. We're saying: 'Wait a minute! It's not 
OK. We're not going to tolerate that.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the two weeks before the block party, a team of undercover officers made 14 
arrests for buying or selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, city officials wrote landlords, warning that they could lose 
their property if they did not take steps to keep the dealers out. Code 
enforcement officers and building officials handed out notices with details of 
needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"This place has completely turned around," Santoro said. "Two weeks ago, you 
wouldn't have even driven down this street. You would have had that feeling 
that something wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents complained that the police had been heavy-handed in cleaning up 
the block. "They think they can just come down here and arrest all the black 
folks," said a young man who called himself Ice Water. "That's cold. Ain't 
nobody listening to them." 
</P>
<P>
But most of the people who had gathered in the street at dusk were pleased to 
see officers milling about, smiles on their faces, sipping punch. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times people are afraid of the police," said Mario Ortiz, 33, who 
watched the festivities with his 8-year-old son. "This is a way of winning 
trust."

PANEL DERAILS BILL TO BLOCK PAROLE OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA: UNLESS A STATE SENATE COMMITTEE CHANGES ITS MIND, THE CITY WILL FIND 
IT DIFFICULT TO FIGHT RELOCATION OF THE FACILITY FROM ALHAMBRA.

<P>
A state Senate committee has sidetracked a bill that would block construction 
of parole offices within 500 yards of residential areas, schools and parks, 
thwarting efforts to keep a parole office out of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters and opponents of the legislation agreed that it will be harder now 
for Pasadena to fight the relocation of a parole office from Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
The suspended bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Patrick J. Nolan (R-Glendale), 
will die in the Senate Appropriations Committee in 10 days unless Nolan can 
persuade the committee to reconsider. The bill passed the Assembly in January. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan could not be reached for comment on whether he will try to resurrect the 
bill, which he introduced last year after residents rallied against a plan by 
the state Department of Corrections to open a parole office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One supporter of the bill said he doubts that it will survive. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a slim, slim chance it will pass," said Pasadena resident Harold 
Britton, leader of a citizens group that successfully fought a plan to move the 
parole office to 468 N. Rosemead Blvd. in the Lower Hastings Ranch area of 
Northeast Pasadena. "We sent 6,000 postcards and letters in support of (the 
legislation). Apparently that wasn't a drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Britton and Director William Thomson flew to Sacramento on Monday to lobby for 
the bill, while Monterey Park and Alhambra officials argued against it. On 
Tuesday, Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu accused Nolan of designing the bill to 
make it impossible to build a parole office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"How many places are 500 yards from a residential zone?" she asked. "Maybe 
Irwindale or the middle of a pit. It's clear there isn't any place." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson denied that the 500-yard provision was intended to keep the parole 
office out of Pasadena altogether. He said it was intended to protect 
residential areas and children from the higher crime rates believed common in 
areas frequented by parolees. 
</P>
<P>
If the bill passes and state officials find a location that meets the 
requirements, "we'd have no choice but to accept the office," he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is not about keeping a parole office out of Pasadena nor is it about 
keeping one in Alhambra," Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
The parole office controversy began in 1988, when Alhambra and Monterey Park 
officials and residents complained about crime, loitering and graffiti near the 
parole office at 1721 E. Garvey Ave. They urged state officials to close that 
office, with each city pledging up to $100,000 in relocation costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Corrections agreed, and began looking at possible sites in 
Pasadena. Since then, Pasadena residents have staged demonstrations, and the 
city Board of Directors adopted a resolution opposing any parole office within 
the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
But state officials have insisted on Pasadena because it is home to about 500 
parolees, the largest concentration in the northwest San Gabriel Valley, yet 
has no parole office. Meanwhile, Alhambra has two offices serving 2,500 
parolees, only 70 of whom live in Alhambra, said Michael Conway, a parole 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Conway said the Department of Corrections is considering two Pasadena 
locations: a 9,000-square-foot office at 333 E. Walnut St. near City Hall and 
two buildings in the 3400 block of Foothill Boulevard near Lower Hastings 
Ranch.

RECALL VOTE ON MAYOR DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH EL MONTE: QUESTIONS ABOUT PETITION GATHERERS KEEP THE ELECTION OFF THE 
NOVEMBER BALLOT.

SOUTH EL MONTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena Superior Court judge Tuesday postponed a recall election of South El 
Monte Mayor Sam Quintana until it can be determined whether several people who 
circulated recall petitions were residents of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Marvin B. Grover issued a restraining order preventing the Los Angeles 
County registrar-recorder from placing the recall on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
Grover's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by South El Monte resident 
Franklin Morith claiming that several people who gathered signatures for the 
recall petition did not live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The state Elections Code stipulates that individuals gathering signatures for a 
recall must live in the district affected by the recall. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action came after the registrar-recorder placed the recall on South 
El Monte's November ballot. Although the South El Monte City Council voted in a 
split decision last Thursday to keep the recall off the ballot, county 
officials said they detected no wrongdoing in the petition process and 
therefore placed the matter on the ballot. City Clerk Kathy Gonzales said 1,217 
people signed the petitions, representing 25% of South El Monte's 4,866 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, backers of the recall charge that Quintana had a conflict of 
interest and should not have voted on the matter when it came before the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"It was improper, it was self-serving," said Councilman Raul Pardo , who 
supports the recall and believes that the mayor is behind the lawsuit in an 
attempt to save his position on the city council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sham," Pardo added. "I think (Quintana) has total contempt for the 
election process and the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
Pardo said that the validity of the recall petitions was certified by the city 
clerk and the county clerk and that the lawsuit is a delaying tactic to ensure 
Quintana remains on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana responded that the city attorney told him he could vote on the matter 
without a conflict of interest. Quintana said he and a group of supporters 
asked Morith if he would allow his name to be used as the plaintiff in the 
lawsuit and that Morith agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's supporters, calling themselves the Committee Against Recall, are 
paying the legal fees for the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Morith, who brought the suit, could not be located for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Considine, a local businessman, helped organize the recall effort. 
Considine denied that the petitions were circulated improperly and said 
Quintana is ignoring his constituents -- one reason his recall was being 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
"There (were) more people who signed that petition than voted in the last 
election," Considine said. "This is just a ploy by Stan Quintana to get off the 
hook." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Art Olmos, however, said the lawsuit was needed to challenge 
irregularities in the way signatures were gathered. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the people circulating the petitions falsely informed residents 
that their homes would be confiscated by the city for redevelopment if Quintana 
remained in office. 
</P>
<P>
Olmos and City Councilman Albert Perez were early targets of the recall effort, 
but petitioners failed to get the necessary number of signatures to place their 
names on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 19 to determine whether the petitions 
for Quintana's recall are valid. Depending on the outcome of that hearing, the 
city can either hold a special election or drop the matter, Pardo said.

GANGS, CRIME RISE IN W. COVINA

Gangs and gang-related crimes have increased significantly, according to a 
report released Friday by the police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Murder, drug trafficking, shooting, burglary, rape, robbery and auto theft are 
among the most common gang-related crimes, it said. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, gang-related crimes have increased 32% compared to the same 
period in 1989, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs seem to be the things kids are getting into these days," Police Chief 
Ronald Holmes said. He separated gang members into two categories: hard-core 
and wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
The report covered gang activity for the last decade. In the early 1980s, there 
were two known gangs in West Covina, with 30 and 50 members each, it said. 
Today the city, with a population of 94,200, has 11 gangs with more than 1,400 
members, figures show. 
</P>
<P>
In February, when Holmes made his first semiannual crime report for 1990, the 
City Council authorized $111,000 to create the Street Crime Apprehension Team. 
SCAT, begun in March, has four uniformed patrol officers who work closely with 
the gang and narcotics investigators. In its first four months, SCAT has 
identified 350 gang members, arrested 89 of them for various crimes and seized 
10 weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pasadena, population 132,200, has six gangs with 1,300 members, 
according to Police Sgt. Wayne Hiltz. He said his department started a 
neighborhood crime task force, combining narcotics and street crime units, in 
1985. "The real problem is drugs as opposed to gangs," Hiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Police Sgt. Ron Windell said his department does not have a gang task 
force. He said Pomona, a city of 119,900, has 15 gangs with 2,000 members.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO TRY TO CAPTURE SEATS ON 2 WATER DISTRICT BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalists unhappy over how established water agencies are handling 
underground water pollution in the San Gabriel Valley are backing three 
candidates for seats on two water district boards in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign is going to be about the water cleanup," said Hacienda Heights 
environmentalist Wil Baca, a persistent critic of the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But Burton E. Jones, who is president of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District but is not up for reelection, said environmentalists are raising 
a bogus issue to generate support. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Jones said, "when people turned on their tap, they got water that 
met all the state standards." He said the public has been generally satisfied 
with the water and with the people who lead the districts. 
</P>
<P>
Only twice in the last two decades, Jones said, has his five-member board had 
contested elections: in 1968 and again in 1988, when two environmentally 
oriented candidates, Royall Brown and William Robinson, won seats. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Baca said, "it's even more important to start changing the 
character of those boards. The only way to tangle with the water companies is 
to take over the public agencies." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have targeted two races in the Upper San Gabriel district and 
one in the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. The filing deadline for 
candidates was last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Upper San Gabriel district, incumbent Alfred Wittig, a retired building 
contractor, faces Marvin Cichy, an El Monte environmental lawyer; Patrick Hauk, 
assistant manager of a retail store; Janice Marugg, a community relations 
executive, and William Redcay, an Azusa water superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The district's other contested seat is held by Robert Nicholson of Arcadia, 
chairman of the board of San Gabriel Valley Water Co. He is challenged by 
Anthony Fellow of El Monte, a college professor and environmental writer. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said he and other environmentalists will work to elect Cichy, Fellow and 
Carol A. Montano, who is running for the only contested seat in the San Gabriel 
Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
Montano, of Azusa, has been a leader of the East Valleys Organization, which is 
urging local water agencies to involve the public in decisions over cleaning up 
the valley's severe ground-water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Montano is trying to unseat Donald Clark of Azusa, who was named last week to 
head the newly organized commission of the Main San Gabriel Basin Water Quality 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said prominent water activists have not yet taken sides in the Three 
Valleys Municipal Water District, where three seats are contested. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman William Koch is opposed by Nolie Glover, a sales account 
representative from Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Muriel O'Brien of Claremont faces Dorothy Davis, a Claremont 
businesswoman; and incumbent Paul E. Stiglich, a water quality manager, faces 
Philip G. Crocker, a water district manager from Diamond Bar, and Joe McManus, 
a Diamond Bar businessman.

TEX-MEX TRAVELING WILBURYS;

<P>
FOUR BIG NAMES FUEL THE TEXAS TORNADOS' ROOTSY SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Returning to roots was a recurring theme in '80s pop. 
</P>
<P>
First came the rockabilly revival, then the blues blossomed with renewed mass 
appeal. Cajun and Celtic music emerged as significant pop influences. In 
country music, the second half of the decade brought a stampede back to 
honky-tonk traditionalism. Even folk music made a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
And now: Tex-Mex, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Tornados hope that once people hear their peppy, border-country 
hybrid of Mexican folk, country music, European polkas, rinky rock 'n' roll 
organ sounds and easy-rolling R&amp;B, the answer will be a resounding "si." 
</P>
<P>
With a lineup of four well-regarded, high-profile practitioners of the Tex-Mex 
style, the Tornados are a sort of super-group working in what has been a 
commercially minor form. Having found backing from a major label, the Nashville 
branch of Warner Bros., the Texas Tornados are hoping to make Tex-Mex the next 
strain of roots-music to grow on a mainstream audience. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy Fender and Doug Sahm are the band's marquee names. With his trembling 
tenor and bushy locks, Fender emerged as one of country music's biggest sellers 
in the mid-'70s, but before that he was a wide-ranging performer, firmly 
grounded in Tex-Mex and rhythm and blues. Sahm, one of the most versatile and 
natural roots-rockers, is best known as leader of his '60s band, the Sir 
Douglas Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
On songs like "She's About a Mover" and "Mendocino," Sahm and his ethnically 
diverse group introduced elements of Tex-Mex into the pop Top 40. Fellow Texans 
Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharoahs ("Wooly Bully") and the Detroit-based, 
Mexican-born band, ? and the Mysterians ("96 Tears"), were others who scored in 
the mid-'60s with garage-rock hits that bore a Tex-Mex stamp. 
</P>
<P>
Another Tornado is Augie Meyers, Sahm's old sidekick from the Sir Douglas 
Quintet. Inspired by what he heard from traditional Mexican folk musicians 
around his and Sahm's mutual hometown of San Antonio, Meyers adopted their 
sprightly rhythms on his British-made Vox organ, forging the comically wheezy 
sound that became a trademark of Tex-Mex rock. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the band, and anchoring it firmly in the folk heritage that 
underlies Tex-Mex music, is Flaco Jimenez. Also from San Antonio, Jimenez is a 
Grammy winner whose button-accordion style expands upon music handed down from 
his father, Santiago Jimenez Sr., a noted player regarded as one of the 
pioneers of conjunto music, a Tex-Mex precursor that conjoined German waltzes 
and polkas with Mexican folk. Pop audiences have heard Jimenez' playing on 
records and tours with Ry Cooder, and on Dwight Yoakam's hit, "Streets of 
Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
It was Sahm who got the idea that Tex-Mex might be the way to reach a wide 
audience while still dealing in music with a rootsy feel. 
</P>
<P>
His 1989 album, "Juke Box Music," was a wonderful romp through obscure old 
blues and R&amp;B nuggets, but Antone's, a small label affiliated with the 
famous Austin, Tex., nightclub of the same name, didn't have the clout to get 
Sahm much exposure beyond his existing cult following. 
</P>
<P>
After spending much of the '80s in Canada and Scandinavia, where he enjoyed 
popularity, the 48-year-old Sahm was still thinking about finding his way back 
onto U.S. airwaves (that is, when he wasn't thinking about baseball, a ruling 
passion that Sahm will readily discuss in a gravelly voice full of pine tar and 
resin). 
</P>
<P>
Having a hit record again "is a big deal for me, (though) I can live without 
it," Sahm said over the phone last week from Austin, where the Tornados were 
preparing to play one of their first shows. "But I've had my taste (of chart 
success), and you've got to have more." 
</P>
<P>
Sahm said he started approaching Nashville record companies and producers with 
the idea of doing a Tex-Mex project, figuring it had a chance to catch on with 
country listeners. "It's not like what's coming out these days, but it's 
soulful, and it's real," Sahm said. 
</P>
<P>
One person Sahm persuaded was Cameron Randle, who had worked for the company 
that manages such country stars as Yoakam and the Desert Rose Band. They put 
together a concert last December at a San Francisco nightclub, in which Sahm, 
Meyers, Jimenez and Fender played together for the first time. They wanted to 
feel out whether the players were compatible, and whether the combination could 
draw a crowd. The show was a sellout, and the musicians got on well. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to be real turned off not to see the potential," Sahm said. "I can 
spot a shortstop or an outfielder by the way they walk." In the same way, the 
would-be baseball talent scout could sense that this Tex-Mex aggregate had a 
shot to make it in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Randle took some demo recordings to Warner Bros.' top country 
music scout, and the Tornados quickly were given a four-album contract to 
record in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Released less than a month ago, "Texas Tornados" has sold about 40,000 copies, 
Randle said last week -- a good start. Sahm worries, however, that some country 
radio programmers are too formula-bound to play the album's first single, the 
delightfully hang-dog "Who Were You Thinkin' Of." 
</P>
<P>
"There were some who were dancing around the room (when they heard it), but 
they were saying, 'We can't play it,' " Sahm said. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Randle, the Texas Tornados will try to blow into other 
segments of the pop marketplace. The Sir Douglas Quintet-flavored rocker, 
"Adios Mexico," will be promoted among college and alternative rock stations, 
while "Soy de San Luis," a composition by Flaco Jimenez' father, has been 
released as a single on Spanish-language stations. 
</P>
<P>
For Jimenez, 51, involvement in the Texas Tornados represents a step up to 
major-label status for a musician long hailed in traditionalist circles. 
(Jimenez has appeared before as a sideman on major releases, but never as a 
principal, as he is with the Tornados.) 
</P>
<P>
For Jimenez, playing conjunto accordion music was a family affair that began 
with his grandfather, Patricio, around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to go to the German oom-pah-pah dances around San Antonio," which had 
a substantial German community, Jimenez recalled over the phone from his home 
in San Antonio. "He'd check out their way of playing. He liked it very much, 
and he managed to buy an accordion so he could copy what they played." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez' father, Santiago, learned the accordion in his turn and became one of 
the originators of the conjunto style. Flaco's younger brother, Santiago Jr., 
continues as a strict traditionalist, playing much as their father did in the 
1930s and '40s. But in the early '70s, Flaco, who has played professionally 
since 1956, began to branch out, absorbing other roots forms in his playing. 
(The nickname Flaco means skinny in Spanish; Leonardo is Jimenez' given name.) 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for "jazzing up" his conjunto music, says Jimenez, 
</P>
<P>
came in a phone call from Sahm in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Sahm was in New York, recording his "Doug Sahm and Band" album, a loose, 
off-handed work in which he and Meyers were joined by Bob Dylan and Dr. John, 
among others. Sahm asked Jimenez, who had never been to New York, to fly to the 
sessions and play accordion on some of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Oh man, is this true or not?' " recalled Jimenez, whose touring at 
the time was confined to Chicano dance-hall crowds. "To go and record with 
those biggies! I didn't have a clue what I was going to play. I didn't have a 
tape, no homework. When I was on the plane, I was saying, 'What am I going to 
record? It seemed real difficult, because I didn't know the material." 
</P>
<P>
But the sessions went well, and Jimenez began to think about branching out. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could do more with music," he said. "Doug was the one who broke me 
in. That was my start on jazzing it up, and playing the rock 'n' roll scene." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez subsequently became a touring and recording partner of Ry Cooder, the 
ace blues guitarist who has been a leading roots music exponent. "Ry introduced 
me to the international scene. It was a giant step," said Jimenez, who has 
since been a fixture on the folk festival circuit. 
</P>
<P>
His move into rock settings hasn't set well among some strict conjunto 
traditionalists, Jimenez said. "Sometimes critics say, 'Hey man, you're leaving 
us behind, you're forgetting your roots' -- which is not true. I play the 
waltzes and polkas like my dad, but I think it's best to play other kinds of 
music (as well). I consider music a bouquet of flowers. If it's just one 
(kind), it's not very colorful. But if you have different flowers, it's like a 
rainbow, and the people can pick out their color." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez, who has eight children, said that he leaped at the chance to join the 
Texas Tornados, and will follow up that involvement with a major-label solo 
release to be produced by Cooder and David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, the versatile 
Los Angeles band whose blend of rock, blues and Mexican folk music is praised 
by all the Tornados. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with what I've done along the years. Now it's getting better for 
me as far as exposing the music," Jimenez said. The Tornados will give him his 
widest exposure yet. "Of course, we're not that young, so it's got to be now," 
he added with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy Fender recalls the first time he played with Doug Sahm: it was 1959, and 
Fender, who had scored a local R&amp;B hit in Texas with the song, "Holy One," 
was barnstorming in a fancy Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into San Antonio to promote the record, and I met this scrawny kid 
hanging around me," the affable Fender said from Austin. Fender wound up 
playing a gig on top of the roof of the concession stand at a drive-in movie 
theater, and as he recalls it, Sahm's band backed him up. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked my blue suede shoes, and my long sideburns. He liked the idea of 
riding around in a white Cadillac with a red interior," Fender said, recalling 
with a laugh that he and the teen-aged Sahm wound up spending the night 
drinking and sleeping it off at the home of one of Sahm's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like the Mexican Elvis," Sahm recalls. "Chicks were screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Fender, whose given name is Baldemar Huerta, had his rise blunted in 1960 when 
he was arrested in Baton Rouge, La. for possessing a tiny amount of marijuana. 
He served a three-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
His career momentum didn't start gathering again until the early '70s, when 
Fender hooked up with Huey P. Meaux, the Texas record producer who had turned 
out the Sir Douglas Quintet's early hits. Meaux guided Fender into country 
singing -- and the result was "Before the Next Teardrop Falls," a No. 1 country 
and pop hit. 
</P>
<P>
Fender said he has not put out an album of his own since 1981. His 
highest-profile work during the past few years has been a film role, the part 
of the mayor in "The Milagro Beanfield War." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the Texas Tornados offer came up, Fender was leery. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I wasn't interested," he said. "I've always liked to 
fend for myself. I never wanted to sing with anybody else. With me, it was 
reluctant participation until I saw that (Warner Bros.) was really getting into 
it. I would have hated to sacrifice good songs, good material on an independent 
label that wouldn't get (the record) anywhere. It's like putting a paper boat 
in the ocean and seeing if it will get to England." 
</P>
<P>
Fender said he is making the adjustment to working cooperatively instead of 
being the only singer in the spotlight. All four of the Tornados take lead 
vocal parts. On tour, they are backed by four other players drawn from Sahm's 
and Jimenez's bands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so used to controlling, to talking a lot on stage, but Doug Sahm has a 
bigger mouth than I do," Fender said with a laugh. "It's an adjustment I'll 
have to make. I think it's going to be great." 
</P>
<P>
For Fender, playing in the Tornados means being able to go back to the R&amp;B 
and rock 'n' roll he was playing before his rise as a country singer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play rock 'n' roll because of the fear of losing my country people," 
he said. "They might say, 'The heck with you.' Now I'm playing my guitar and 
getting down with some B.B. King stuff.' 
</P>
<P>
Is Fender hoping to use the Texas Tornados as a vehicle to jump-start his solo 
career? 
</P>
<P>
"Is pork chops greasy? I guess we all want it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also sees the band, which is being tagged as a sort of Tex-Mex Traveling 
Wilburys, as a group with a mission to introduce a wide audience to an 
overlooked sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest asset is we're not like everybody else," Fender said. "We're the 
messengers of a kind of music that's been out of the mainstream so long it's 
pitiful."

The Tropicana Bar and Grill, 610 Avenida Victoria (across from the San Clemente 
Municipal Pier), San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Open Sundays through Thursdays till 11, Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
(714) 498-TROP. A yuppie joint with charm. Sit leisurely under the thatched 
roof and sip tropical drinks while viewing the pier and surfers below. The most 
memorable feature, though, is found in the ladies room: a mural of Tarzan that 
lets out a yell in the bar when you pull down the Ape Man's loincloth.JAMES M.

Tuesdays-Thursdays till 11, and Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. (714) 
553-1333. Frazzled after a day on the fast track? Try a glass of Chianti 
Classico or a Sambuca Romana at Prego: It may be the best yuppie/muppie (for 
middle-aged) bar around here. On warm summer nights you can sit outside on the 
patio, where there's jazz on Thursdays and Fridays and chamber music on 
Saturdays, starting at 6:30 p.m. CLAUDIA LUTHER

Henry N' Harry's Goat Hill Tavern, 1830 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 548-8428. This place serves no fewer 
than 96 brands of tap beer; the keg room looks like Jerry Lee Lewis' idea of a 
well-stocked bomb shelter. The tavern proper consists of several rooms, packed 
with games and decorated with everything from buffalo heads to Elvis dolls. 
Best of all, there are, to quote a regular, "people from all over the world 
here, all kinds, slobs and business people, and they let it all down." JIM

MAX JACOBSON: FULLERTON HOFBRAU BREWS TASTY SOPHISTICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My happiest years were spent in Madison, Wis., the Paris -- uh, make that the 
Munich -- of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The student union on the University of Wisconsin campus is renowned for its 
giant rathskeller; "the Rat," as students call it. The Rat is a cavernous 
Bavarian-style beer hall where German proverbs stare down at you from arching 
brown plaster walls while you sit at oak tables that haven't been refinished 
since the school sent a team to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, like their elders before them, large numbers of young people pass 
the time at those tables, halfheartedly attempting to study. Tradition. I cut 
many a class there myself. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder I felt a twinge of sentiment when I visited Fullerton Hofbrau for the 
first time. Like my beloved rathskeller, Fullerton Hofbrau is a cavernous, 
wood-beamed room with collegiate servers (from nearby Cal State Fullerton) and 
walls full of German proverbs such as Hopfen und Malz, Gott erhalt's (hops and 
malt, praise the Lord). What's more, the room is alive with a young crowd, a 
crowd on hand to quaff drafts of ice-cold beer and down hearty portions of 
bratwurst and German potato salad. If only I were 21 again. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Rombergian appeal, Fullerton Hofbrau is really more of a grown-up 
restaurant than the one I'm all misty over. For one thing, it brews its own 
beer, in five vast copper vats that come upon you suddenly as you enter. (The 
restaurant is in limited partnership with a place called Hofbrauhaus in 
Traunstein, Germany, meaning that the beers you drink here are brewed in 
accordance with traditional Bavarian recipes.) 
</P>
<P>
And for another, the foods cooked up by young American chef Dan Thomas are a 
far cry from the wieners and potato chips on which we subsisted in student 
days. This is food for sophisticates . . . beer-drinking ones, that is. 
</P>
<P>
First, about those beers. There are four to sample here: King's Lager, Prince's 
Pilsener, Duke's Bock and Knight's Light. The lager is too thin for any 
monarch, but I liked its mild, malty aftertaste. The pilsener is indeed 
princely, a slightly bitter brew with a wicked bite that doesn't taste a thing 
like American beer. The bock is ducal, too, I suppose; dark, potent and sweet. 
The light was unavailable during my visits. 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, this menu is loaded with appetizers designed to complement 
the frothy house brews. Wild game "speedies" -- marinated game on wooden 
skewers -- are a lot like the snacks you find in small Bavarian bierstuben. If 
you're lucky, a lean venison version will be available, charbroiled and nearly 
fork-tender. Other days you'll have to settle for lamb. It's a good cut, but it 
lacks the gamy taste of the venison. 
</P>
<P>
The specialty sausage sampler should really make you thirsty. It's a plateful 
of bratwurst, beer-spiced sausage and Cajun-style sausage, cut up into 
bite-sized rounds and served with a sweet Bavarian-style mustard sauce. The 
beer-spiced is the best of them, a crumbly textured sausage with an intense 
flavor. The bratwurst, a soft, white veal sausage with a hint of nutmeg, isn't 
bad, either. Forget the tough, oily Cajun sausage, though (hey, how'd that get 
in here, anyway?). 
</P>
<P>
One appetizer that goes well with the pilsener is beer-steamed clams: a full 
pound of clams, simmered in lager beer and swimming in onion, garlic and 
butter. Another is fried tomatoes. Fried tomatoes? Yes, beer-battered tomato 
slices topped with mozzarella. They fall apart when you put a fork to them and 
they taste great. One to miss, however, is "curly Q fries." These lightly 
battered potato squiggles taste like onion rings and are so greasy you can't 
pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
The large dinner menu is basically German with some continental specialties 
thrown in for good measure. Rouladen is about the best dish Thomas makes, and 
bearing in mind that he is new at German cuisine, I'd call it a remarkable 
effort. He stuffs round steak with sweet onions, bacon and a flour-based roux, 
then rolls it up and smothers it with a delicious dark gravy. He serves it with 
homemade spaetzle: buttery little flour dumplings that soak up gravy like 
sponges. This is heavy fare, the antithesis of California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't much care for his Wienerschnitzel, though. This is supposed to be a 
delicate dish of veal pounded thin and sauteed crisp, but Thomas' version is 
rather heavy, a thick slab of veal in a crunchy coating. His smoked pork chops 
work like a charm, though, accompanied by a creditable sauerkraut. And they go 
well with almost any beer you choose. 
</P>
<P>
If German dishes aren't your thing, you can sink your teeth into pastas, 
burgers, stuffed crab, sauteed duckling, even items from the salad bar. 
</P>
<P>
This salad bar is generous, like the chef's portions, and good things like 
German potato salad, a rich chicken salad, fresh fruit and the fresh salad 
trimmings make it a cut above the usual. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are just what you would expect in this type of establishment: Black 
Forest cake, apple strudel, and one or two more other Teutonic masterpieces 
that change daily. If they don't suit you, there is an excellent German bakery, 
Demes Gourmet, just next door.

Happy birthday, dear Napoleon? Yup, Saturday, Aug. 18, is the birthday of 
Bonaparte, and for the fifth consecutive year, Le Meridien Hotel, Newport 
Beach, will celebrate with an evening of dining and dancing in Cafe Fleuri. The 
cafe staff will dress for the occasion and guests are invited to do likewise. A 
four-course dinner focuses on consomme of crab and veal medallions with a fresh 
tomato concasse. Music will be by the Christian Dimaggio Trio. The evening 
begins at 7:30 and the tab is $30. The hotel is located at 4500 MacArthur 
Blvd., Newport Beach. Reservations: (714) 476-2001, Ext. 2194.

The Robert Mondavi Wine &amp; Food Center will celebrate summer on Saturday, 
Aug. 18, with a Midsummer Night's Dinner Dance. Bamboo-broiled shiitake 
mushrooms and chicken skewers with oyster sauce will be served with a Mondavi 
sparkling wine in the Rose Garden; then a different Mondavi Reserve wine will 
accompany each of the four dinner courses, which include grilled tiger shrimp 
tostada with Caribbean salsa, and terrine of rabbit and pheasant with chilled 
basil-stewed tomatoes and homemade pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
The Bobby Dorman Big Band with Cassie Miller as featured vocalist will perform

The Cafe at the Westin South Coast Plaza brings a new twist to the 
old-as-Bacchus idea of wine makers' dinners Thursday, Aug. 16, and Friday, Aug. 
17. Instead of a staged presentation with formal seating and a set menu, diners 
will select their dining time (between 6 and 9 p.m.), as well as what and how 
much they want to eat. 
</P>
<P>
This week's featured wine maker, Bruce Newlan of Newlan Vineyards in Napa 
Valley, will be on hand both evenings to chat informally with diners. Some of 
the menu choices: tarragon-marinated shrimp appetizer, broiled and served with 
tomatillo salsa on a bed of angel hair pasta (Newlan's Chardonnay suggested to 
complement); pan-fried veal medallion stuffed with mushroom duxelle, with 
garlic rosemary sauce and wild rice (Newlan's Pinot Noir estate, 1987, 
suggested). 
</P>
<P>
Entrees will be priced from $12 to $17 and wines by the glass start at $4. 
</P>
<P>
The Newlan menu and wines will also be featured nightly in The Cafe during the 
last two weeks in August and first two weeks of September. 
</P>
<P>
A different winery will be spotlighted in a similar manner each month. The 
Westin is at 666 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa; (714) 540-2500.

Chef Gino Mattei from Tuscany recently joined Salvatore D'Abbusco at the 
4-month-old Salvatore Cucina Italiana in Mission Viejo. Since Mattei is from 
northern Italy and D'Abbusco is from Naples (he owned Cafe Napoli in Van Nuys 
before moving to Orange County), they suggest that they have the Italian 
repertoire well covered. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate their grand opening, all during August, Salvatore's offering a 
$9.95 dinner: bruschetta appetizer, homemade soup or Caesar salad, choice of 12 
pastas (including fettucini with porcini mushrooms; cappelini with olive oil, 
fresh tomatoes, capers, black olives; linguine and clams, ravioli Gorgonzola), 
plus coffee and choice of three desserts.

* Pinky's Hamburger Grill, 4115 Campus Drive, Irvine. (714) 854-4632. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 
11 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
 Be-Bop Burgers and Pinky's Hamburger Grill are part of a wave of "nostalgia" 
hamburger joints engulfing Orange County, and both are longer on atmosphere 
than food. The Be-Bop burger is a good value, a full quarter pound of lean beef 
on a seeded bun that just drips with condiments. Pinky's beach burgers are 
charcoal-grilled and really taste good. Other sandwiches in both restaurants 
are less appealing. Luckily, both restaurants exude energy, plus the mindless 
fun of the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
* La Palma Chicken Pie Shop and Restaurant, 928 N. Euclid Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
533-2021. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Bakery 
opens at 9 a.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
 This is where you want to go for meat loaf, pan-fried chicken and the other 
kinds of tried-and-true, roadside American fare that is creeping back onto the 
menus in more upscale establishments. The signature dish, chicken pie, is a 
buttery, 9-ounce disk crammed with shredded meat. At $1.95, it makes a great, 
affordable snack. Don't bypass the attached bakery, where the goodies include 
peach pie, burnt-almond cake and a rich house cheesecake, and where an 
excellent, springy chocolate cake is only $3. 
</P>
<P>
* Mimi's Cafe, five Orange County locations: 1240 N. Euclid St., Anaheim, (714) 
535-1552; 1835 E. Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa, (714) 722-6722; 7935 Garden Grove 
Blvd., Garden Grove, (714) 898-5022; 17231 E. 17th St., Tustin, (714) 544-5522; 
18342 Imperial Highway, Yorba Linda, (714) 996-7650. Open daily from 7 a.m. to 
11 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi's Cafe has 10 Southland locations boasting identical menus and decor. 
There is almost always a line to get in. The menu includes soups, salads, 
sandwiches and breakfasts along with such entrees as mesquite-broiled fish and 
a host of (commercially) baked desserts. The kittenish and busy decor hints at 
France, though from the outside, the places look like gingerbread houses. Food 
at Mimi's tastes much like what the French think American food is: burgers, 
muffins and egg dishes, but overall, it's little more than a glorified coffee 
shop. It's cheap, at least. 
</P>
<P>
* Papa's Pantry, 21094 Beach Boulevard, Huntington Beach. (714) 960-5400. Open 
Mondays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays 11 
a.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
* Polly's Pies, 3404 Katella Avenue, Los Alamitos. (213) 430-4541. Open daily, 
6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Polly's Pies and Papa's Pantry are two restaurants dishing up solid American 
comfort foods at solidly affordable prices. So dig in. Polly's is the place for 
good burgers and a superb rotisserie chicken to go along with its visually 
stunning fresh fruit pies and bright, sunny interior. Papa's Pantry is 
basically a steakhouse trading on huge portions and frontier-style decor. Try 
chicken fried steak, sauteed liver and prime rib -- all complete dinners for 
$7.95 or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
* Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays, 5 to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 5 to 11 p.m.; lunch 
served Fridays only, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this 
restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly 
as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you 
would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop and catfish 
entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine. 
</P>
<P>
* Shan-Li Palace, 5634 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. (714) 779-1410. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays and Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 
to 10:30 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
This Mandarin-style Chinese restaurant is further proof that gentrification is 
spreading like a brush fire. It is nestled snugly in the Anaheim Hills not far 
from the Riverside County line. A few years back, you couldn't have found a 
hamburger stand in these parts. Order the steamed dumplings, despite the fact 
that the waiter may try to discourage you. They are wonderful. Spinach 
bean-curd soup tastes as fresh as if the spinach came from out back. 
Twice-cooked pork is fiery and colorful. Moo-shu dishes (minced meats and 
veggies rolled up burrito-style) are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTINENTAL 
</P>
<P>
* The Hobbit, 2932 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 997-1972. Open for dinner 
Tuesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. $$$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit is a special occasion restaurant, serving prix fixe dinners that are 
elaborate without being pretentious. Book well in advance. You begin the 
evening in the restaurant's wine cellar, nibbling on Julia Child-like 
appetizers, sipping champagne and chatting with total strangers. Chef Mike 
Phillippi takes it all very seriously, preparing solid food that is 
well-balanced, though rarely brilliant. Entrees like beef Wellington and 
lobster Thermidor rotate weekly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENGLISH 
</P>
<P>
* McCharles House, 335 S. C St., Tustin. (714) 731-4063. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for lunch; 2 to 5 p.m. for tea; Thursdays 
through Saturdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m. for dinner. $$ 
</P>
<P>
If you have never experienced a proper English tea, then now's your chance at 
this converted Victorian house, built circa 1885 in Tustin's Old Town. You'll 
even get heart-shaped scones. Audrey Heredia and her daughter, Vivian, fuss 
over this dining room and tearoom, a spinster's fantasy of wooden tables, 
tasseled lamps and enough doilies to make Gladys Cooper an overcoat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRENCH 
</P>
<P>
* Voila Bistro and Grill, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 841-1166. 
Open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 9 p.m. 
$$$ 
</P>
<P>
A new local dining spot, Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising find indeed, a 
combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic. Chef Rochelle Robinson 
turns a brilliant onion soup -- a bistro classic -- and does fine braised duck 
and lamb dishes. Dessert souffles such as chocolate and lemon are on the varied 
menu, and, given proper notice, the chef will even make a cheese souffle. 
Salads, pizzas and a respectable little wine list fill things out nicely. 
</P>
<P>
* The Wine Cellar, Hyatt Newporter, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. (714) 
644-1700. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Cellar is Orange County's newest temple of haute cuisine. Menus are 
rotated every week and consist of five courses designed by Jean Banchet of Le 
Francais in Wheeling, Ill., one of the most famous chefs in the world today. 
Menu VI -- which begins with a cold pheasant pate with green chartreuse, 
continues with a stuffed filet of sole in a champagne sauce and features 
grilled squab with green cabbage and natural juices -- is one of six prie fixe 
menus presented by executive chef Ted Gray, and it is a knockout. You won't 
find better French cuisine anywhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEXICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5546. Open nightly from 
5:30 to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Kachina is new, but it already may be the county's best restaurant. Named for 
Hopi Indian dolls that represent spirits, the restaurant serves food that is 
rare and exotic -- edible art. David Wilhelm, late of Pave and the El Torito 
Grill, has composed a menu featuring some of the most imaginative, intelligent 
cooking this side of the Twilight Zone, full of sumptuous tastes and 
color-splashed textures. Run, don't walk, to taste the green-corn tamale, 
honey-glazed pork and celestial chocolate bread pudding. And go early. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEAFOOD 
</P>
<P>
* Los Alamitos Fish Company, 11061 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos. (213) 
594-4553. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and 
Saturdays to 11 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Order mesquite-broiled fish from the restaurant's giant circular grill, or 
enjoy a brace of other dishes such as steamed Dungeness crab, smoked albacore 
tuna or simply flavored steamers, all of which go beautifully with the 
restaurant's standout sourdough bread. Desserts are all homemade. The best of 
them are a superior blackout cake and a soft, tart lemon mousse pie. 
</P>
<P>
* McCormick and Schmick, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (714) 756-0505. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturdays from 5 to 11 p.m.; Sundays 
from 5 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
McCormick and Schmick is the latest member of an exclusive chain that started 
in the Pacific Northwest, a slick, muscular operation specializing in fresh 
seafoods, and the food is terrific. Oysters like Quilicene, Olympia, Golden 
Mantle and Skookum taste as if they have just been dragged from the sea. Fish 
like Copper River salmon in cream with bay scallops, or sea bass with Jamaican 
spices, are good enough to make a grown man weep. Non-fish-eaters can feast on 
marinated chicken or Cajun cheeseburgers. Head of the class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THAI 
</P>
<P>
* California Wok, 4466 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. (714) 527-0226. Open 
Mondays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 
p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Eat health-conscious, pan-Asian food in this spotless little gem, owned and 
operated by a Thai microbiologist who is a gem herself (her name, Baiyok, means 
"jade leaf"). Chinese dishes here are excellent, prepared with pure soy oil. 
Especially good are vegetarian egg rolls and stir-fried chicken in an edible 
basket of straw potato. Thai dishes are equally fine. Nam sod is fiery ground 
pork with chili. Pad Thai is fried flat noodles. And tod mun plar are rubbery 
fish cakes with mint and cilantro. Wonderful and light alternative Asian fare. 
</P>
<P>
* Thai Nakorn, 8674 Stanton Ave., Buena Park. (714) 952-4954. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Thai Nakorn is an innocent-looking storefront restaurant, but inside awaits the 
blistering fare of northeast Thailand, arguably the world's hottest cuisine. A 
long list of specialties will make a believer out of you. Typical standouts are 
larb (ground pork with brown rice, onion, lime juice and chili) and nuad dad 
deal (dried, salted beef with a faint aftertaste of the sea). Appetizers show 
the restaurant's class. Try the savage barbecued shrimp salad with mint sprig 
or the homemade sausage wrapped in cabbage leaves. Frog, eel and other exotica 
can be ordered from a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VIETNAMESE 
</P>
<P>
* Thien Thanh, 5423 W. First St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays from 
10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; weekends from 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants; it is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture. The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic-centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss. Lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 noodle 
dishes.

RESERVISTS TRY TO READ PRESIDENT'S LIPS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: ALONG WITH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN, THEY MAY BE CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY, 
DISRUPTING THEIR PERSONAL LIVES AND INFLICTING ECONOMIC PAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Buena Park police training officer Gary Jackson, a captain in the Army Reserve, 
was a little worried Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He has teen-age daughters who love $60 Guess jeans. And one daughter is on the 
verge of getting married. 
</P>
<P>
If President Bush calls up reservists for active duty -- as he was considering 
Wednesday -- Jackson would soon have less money for designer jeans and might 
not be around for the nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of 14,425 military reservists and National Guardsmen in Orange 
County, and if Bush calls them to active duty in the Iraqi conflict, the impact 
on individuals 
</P>
<P>
like Jackson and on businesses could be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
By law, Bush has the power to call up reserves for at least three months and 
can extend that tour of duty another three months. Beyond that, the President 
must get approval from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Employees called for involuntary duty in the reserves are entitled to 
reinstatement in their old job, or an equivalent one, at the same pay they held 
before their military stint. 
</P>
<P>
But like jury duty, the terms of a worker's leave, from salary to medical 
benefits, are up to the employer, and in Orange County, a check Wednesday 
indicated those terms vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
For Jackson, a return to active duty would spell both financial and personal 
hardship. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department would pay him two weeks salary, but after that his active 
duty salary of $3,500 a month as an Army captain would kick in. It is less than 
his civilian earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 42, who helped to set up and train a new national police force in 
Panama last year during the U.S. intervention, has been in the Army Reserve for 
2 1/2 years. He was unconcerned about his job security but fretted more about 
his daughter's wedding before 200 guests. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a shame to miss my daughter's wedding," Jackson said Wednesday. "I 
just hope the call comes after the first of the month. . . . I'll be losing 
some. But for someone in an enlisted rank, it will be much harder, obviously, 
because the pay is lower." 
</P>
<P>
Low-ranking reservists can make as little as $50 a day on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, attorney Kevin McDermott and his law partner, Robison Harley, are 
closely watching Bush's pending decision to call up reserves. McDermott is a 
captain in the Marine Corps Reserve and Harley a lieutenant colonel. A call to 
active duty would essentially kill their law practice. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a number of clients, and you either have to persuade a judge to 
delay the case . . . or pick up the phone and call a lot of clients (and) 
refund a lot of money," McDermott said. "We'd just have to shut down the whole 
practice. I think both of us would probably take a hell of a beating." 
</P>
<P>
And his staff of four also would be without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, he and thousands of others who sign on for their four- to 
six-year reserve duty knew the potential for that call, which could take them 
to any post at home or abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been considering mobilizing some of the nation's 
1.6 million reserves and National Guardsmen to fill positions vacated by 
thousands of troops bound for the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Army Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, briefed Bush at the Pentagon on Wednesday on the Middle East 
crisis and what military experts consider the largest U.S. military deployment 
since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, Cheney and Powell also discussed the possibility of activating 200,000 
reservists -- the maximum allowed by law unless the country is at war. If that 
happens, it will be the largest deployment of reserves since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"They were looking at the call-up of the Guard and reserves as an option, and 
there was nothing being done with it at this time," Pentagon spokesman Doug 
Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
National Guard units are state militia overseen by governors, hence a 
presidential order activating reserves would not affect them, Pentagon 
spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said. Yet Hart said that does not rule out the National 
Guard entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"They are as ready as reserves," he said. "All of them train on an active 
basis, so the way a call-up would happen is, (military leaders) would figure 
out the needs and demands and take those with specialties in either the Guard 
or the reserves to fill those needs." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the National Guard, with 13,000 people, far outnumbers the 
reserves of other services. Military officials in Washington said Orange County 
is home to 400 naval reservists, 1,025 Marine reservists and a substantial 
number of Army reservists based at Los Alamitos. In California as a whole, 
there are 130,000 reservists, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The current situation is we have reservists and National Guardsmen who are 
supporting our efforts in the Middle East as volunteers," Bodanyi said. 
</P>
<P>
As with jury duty, she said, employers are allowed to make mostly their own 
arrangements for compensation and job security for workers who are volunteer 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
From Orange County's largest employer, Hughes Aircraft Co., to the family-run 
diner around the corner, the terms for those in the reserves vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Silvius, a spokesman for Fullerton-based Hughes, said the company grants 
military leaves to reservists and guarantees that their jobs will be protected 
until they return. He said he did not know how many of the firm's 12,000 
employees are reservists, but he indicated that a call-up would not have a 
major impact on Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
At Disneyland, 8,000 full-time employees are guaranteed a military leave of up 
to 30 days, spokesman Bob Roth said. The amusement park also supplements armed 
services salaries so that employees take home something equivalent to their 
usual pay. However, Roth said, jobs are not guaranteed beyond a 30-day leave. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times, with 10,000 employees, 1,200 of them in Orange County, 
grants unpaid military leave to both full- and part-time workers for as long as 
service is required. However, employees must apply for their jobs within 90 
days after being released from service if they want to retain employment 
rights. Employees are not required to apply their vacation time to military 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"By far, the majority of employers are very supportive of their employees' 
reserve service," said Pentagon public affairs specialist Brian R. Kilgallen. 
"If there are problems, the Department of Labor has the statutory 
responsibility to assist the service member and the Department of Defense has 
an organization to help mediate any problems."

FIRM THAT TRACKS DOWN TEEN DRUG ADDICTS COMES UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATORS: ONCE FOUND, THE RUNAWAYS, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE PARENTS, ARE 
TRANSPORTED TO TREATMENT FACILITIES. THE STATE IS INVESTIGATING THE COMPANY FOR 
NOT HAVING THE PROPER LICENSES.

<P>
When their 15-year-old daughter ran away from their Simi Valley home in 1988 
after a history of cocaine use, Donald and Alice Soeder were frustrated and 
scared. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted their daughter, Jane, off the streets and in a drug abuse treatment 
program, but they had only a vague idea of where to find her and no clue of how 
to get her to help. 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of a Port Hueneme drug treatment facility, the Soeders called 
S&amp;L Teen Hospital Shuttle, a Canoga Park firm that transports youths with 
drug problems, sometimes forcibly, to treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, using photographs of the girl and telephone records, the firm 
found her and drove her -- with her hands and feet bound -- to the Port Hueneme 
facility. Two years after Jane completed treatment, she and her parents have 
nothing but praise for S&amp;L. "There was no way that they by themselves could 
have gotten me," Soeder said of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm, the only one of its kind currently operating in the Los Angeles 
area, has also drawn criticism from some drug treatment officials and the 
attention of regulatory officials. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L operates as both a transport and an investigative service, those who 
have used the firm said. Sometimes the company simply drives stubborn youths 
with drug problems from their homes to treatment centers. In other cases, such 
as Jane Soeder's, it tracks down addicted teens who have run away from home, 
then restrains them during the drive to rehabilitation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
State officials last month began investigating the company, which is 
recommended to parents of addicted teens by a handful of Los Angeles drug 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L is authorized by the state to operate as a transport service. It is 
registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, the agency that 
licenses businesses such as limousines, buses and airport shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is listed in the telephone book as an ambulance service, but is not 
licensed as such by the city, county, or state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is S&amp;L licensed to conduct private investigative work. Last month, 
the California Department of Consumer Affairs' Bureau of Collection and 
Investigative Services began to investigate S&amp;L, said Gretchen Werry, the 
bureau's program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Miller, who with Steven Sawhill owns and operates S&amp;L out of the 
couple's Canoga Park house, referred questions about the firm and the state 
investigation to their lawyer, Larry Mandell. 
</P>
<P>
"They just transport kids that have drug problems because the parents can't do 
it for themselves," Mandell said. "They have their referrals, and things are 
working out good, and they'd just like to keep it at that." 
</P>
<P>
Mandell declined to discuss S&amp;L or the state's investigation in more 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Consumer Affairs last week sent S&amp;L a "cease and desist" 
letter ordering the firm either to shut down permanently or to stop the 
investigative part of its work until it applies for and receives the proper 
state license, said Denise Grayson, the department investigator assigned to the 
S&amp;L case. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Sawhill will have one month from the day they receive the letter to 
respond, Werry said. If they ignore the letter or cannot show that they have 
proper licensing, she said, the department ultimately could recommend 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Operating as a private investigator without a state license is a misdemeanor 
punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and a jail term of up to one year, Werry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain a private investigator's license, an applicant must perform 6,000 
hours -- approximately three years -- of investigative work with either a law 
enforcement agency or a private detective firm and must pass a written test, 
Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
The "cease and desist" letter sent by the Consumer Affairs Department this week 
was the second such notice mailed to S&amp;L in a year. On Aug. 3, 1989, days 
after they learned of S&amp;L in a magazine article that mentioned the firm, 
officials from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation sent the firm a 
letter ordering it either to obtain a transport service license or shut down, 
said Donald Mansion, a DOT investigator. 
</P>
<P>
It was nine days later -- on Aug. 12, 1989 -- that Sawhill and Miller applied 
for state authorization to operate as a transport service. 
</P>
<P>
In their permit application, the couple identified themselves as an equal 
partnership under the name "SLTHS." They claimed five years of experience in 
the transport field, and described their business only as "shuttling teen-agers 
and adults to requested destination." 
</P>
<P>
Drug treatment workers who have referred parents to S&amp;L said the firm 
charges a fee based on driving distance and time involved in locating and 
transporting each teen-ager. One treatment worker said the fee averages $600 
per case. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Lamb, administrator of Anacapa Adventist Hospital, a 48-bed juvenile 
psychiatric hospital in Port Hueneme that uses S&amp;L "a couple times a 
month," said S&amp;L's fee is not covered by patients' medical insurance. He 
said Anacapa, the facility to which S&amp;L took Jane Soeder, pays the 
transport fees for the teen-agers it receives from S&amp;L, and does not pass 
those fees on to the youths' parents. 
</P>
<P>
There is no law prohibiting private citizens from helping parents find and 
retrieve a runaway child, even if the effort requires them to use "reasonable 
force," said Dallas Binger, a consultant to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
juvenile narcotics unit. But anyone who does so as a business must be licensed 
for the task, Binger said. 
</P>
<P>
Past S&amp;L customers said the firm's workers do not carry weapons, and that 
when they suspect they may confront violence in retrieving a teen-ager they 
contact police for backup help. But neither Binger nor the police departments 
reported by customers to have helped S&amp;L in individual cases said they had 
heard of the shuttle company. 
</P>
<P>
Customers and treatment centers who have used the firm said they knew of no 
instance in which S&amp;L injured a teen-ager under its care. Many praised the 
company as acting professionally and compassionately in an obscure and poorly 
regulated field where the potential for abuse is great. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to know what you're doing," said Dan Leon, program coordinator for 
the Avalon adolescent drug treatment program at Coldwater Canyon Hospital in 
North Hollywood, a 30-bed facility that receives approximately 25% of its 
patients from S&amp;L. "You've got to know how to deal with the kid. That's why 
we use them. We know they're not going to rough the kid up unnecessarily." 
</P>
<P>
But several people who work in the adolescent drug treatment field, including 
some who said they have referred parents to S&amp;L, said they objected to the 
company's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like somebody else trying to exploit the drug problem," said Scott 
Lewis, a spokesman for the California Department of Health Services, who said 
he had not heard of S&amp;L. "You know what it reminds me of? The old 
deprogramming days," he said, referring to firms hired by parents to retrieve 
teen-agers who ran away from home to join cults. 
</P>
<P>
Some drug treatment experts took issue with the concept of forcing teen-agers 
to enter drug treatment centers against their will. 
</P>
<P>
"When kids come to programs like this, the more you strong-arm them into the 
program the less they'll work in the program," said Chris Layton, clinical 
supervisor of Renew Life, a 23-bed, nonprofit facility for teens with drug or 
behavioral problems located at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"Often these shuttle services are hired to force a person into a situation they 
don't want to be in," said Layton, who said he referred parents to S&amp;L in 
the past. "In that case, you end up spending the first few weeks just working 
on that issue." 
</P>
<P>
Others who work with adolescent drug abusers, however, argued that forced entry 
into a treatment program is sometimes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as simple as, 'They have to want the help to get it,' " said Jay 
Cavanaugh, president of the board of directors of Interagency Alcohol and Drug 
Rehabilitation Programs, a nonprofit group that runs four non-residential 
adolescent drug treatment centers in the Los Angeles area and that has used 
S&amp;L in the past. "There are a lot of times when the kids are very ill." 
</P>
<P>
"It is definitely the last of the last resorts," said Cindy Hobbs, intake 
coordinator for the Life Plus Treatment Center in Panorama City, a private 
adolescent program that uses S&amp;L about twice a month, usually to retrieve 
runaway teens. But, Hobbs stressed, "I would rather see a kid in a hospital 
safe than out on the streets and using. If that's what needs to be done to get 
the child in, then that's what needs to happen."

<P>
A 12-year-old boy was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting Tuesday night as 
he walked with his brother to a street corner where, moments before, a drug 
deal had apparently gone awry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Sanchez Hernandez, the youngest of five children, was heading to a 
friend's house with his brother, Gus, shortly before midnight when they saw an 
approaching automobile and heard someone shout, "Drive-by." 
</P>
<P>
"I ducked behind a car and I yelled for my brother to follow," Gus Hernandez, 
16, said in an interview Wednesday. "I saw this car go by and then I heard four 
shots. I looked for my brother and there he was, dead." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he found his brother lying on the grass, his head covered with 
blood. Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said the boy was shot once in the 
head and apparently died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The car then sped from the intersection of South Wood and Myrtle streets -- a 
central Santa Ana neighborhood where residents say drug dealers and gang 
members have become increasingly brazen -- but drove back to the corner about a 
minute later, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they were checking to see whether they got anybody," Gus Hernandez 
said. "I don't know why they shot us. It was the first time I ever saw these 
guys. They just started shooting for no reason." 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth, who was not identified by police, was also shot in the leg 
during the attack. But he was treated and released from a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the shooting, police in Westminster stopped a white car 
matching a description obtained earlier and arrested Thomas Trung Nguyen, 22, 
of Santa Ana and Minh Chi Nguyen, 19, of San Bernardino. Both were being held 
in Orange County Jail on suspicion of homicide and assault with a deadly 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said a drug deal had apparently occurred on the street corner moments 
before the two Hernandez brothers walked by. There is no indication that the 
brothers were connected to the drug deal or were gang members, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into the possibility that this (shooting) was a case of mistaken 
identity," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the dead boy's sister, Sally, 15, planted a wooden marker on the 
grass where he fell. The marker reads, "R.I.P. We love you." A piece of black 
cloth was nailed to the door of an apartment where friends and family gathered 
to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro's mother, Victoria, a single parent who works in a plastics factory, 
spent most of the morning arranging her son's funeral and telephoning 
relatives. So far, she said, she does not have enough money to pay for a coffin 
and has asked neighbors to help with the anticipated $2,200 funeral expense. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Najera, Pedro's uncle, said the boy was to have been a seventh-grader at 
Spurgeon Intermediate School this fall. He had told his uncle that he wanted to 
become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"We want justice," Najera said. "He was young. He just started life and they 
took it away from him. They must not let the killers go." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in front of Cristina Ribea's South Wood Street home. 
Ribea said Wednesday that she had been awakened by the gunfire. She said 
residents in the neighborhood have grown increasingly frightened because of 
drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid now for my own two children who are teen-agers," Ribea said. 
"Every day it seems to worsen and the danger is getting closer and closer." 
</P>
<P>
Omar Macias, 12, said he went to school with Pedro, adding that he had just 
talked to the boy a few minutes before the shots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran to the window and saw him laying there," Omar said. "He wasn't a gang 
member, but he got shot anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Pierre, 23, who has lived in the neighborhood since he was a boy, said it 
has been in a steady decline since drug dealers began selling in the area in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a teen-ager around here, we didn't have to worry about walking down 
the street by yourself or whether or not a bullet was going to hit you," Pierre 
said. "This neighborhood is so bad, it really is best just to stay in the 
house. If I have to leave, I make sure I look both ways before coming out."

DEATH OF A DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN KIDNAPED AT DISCO IS REMOVED FROM LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

She had been an A student, her mother said, but when the baby came, she dropped 
out of school. Still, 19-year-old Karen Eickholdt had plans. Someday, she would 
tell her mother, she would get out of Compton and manage a big hotel -- one in 
Hawaii, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Her dream ended at 4:20 p.m. Tuesday when she was removed from a life-support 
system at Greater El Monte Community Hospital. There was no chance, doctors 
concluded, that Eickholdt would recover from massive head injuries suffered 
during a brief abduction outside a popular El Monte disco early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
As family and friends remembered Eickholdt, El Monte police and sheriff's 
homicide detectives reported little progress Wednesday in the hunt for her 
killers. 
</P>
<P>
Eickholdt, several witnesses told detectives, had been accosted by two men 
outside Mr. J's disco and dragged halfway into the cab of a gray pickup that 
then sped away. After traveling about one block, Eickholdt was either thrown to 
the pavement or struggled free and fell, suffering the fatal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors determined her to be brain dead Monday, and a Catholic priest 
administered last rites. Her mother, Ursula Garcia, said family members and 
friends gathered in her room Tuesday afternoon and prayed for her once again. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were praying, several of us saw her hand move, like she was in 
relief," Ursula Garcia said. A short time later, Garcia gave permission for the 
life-support system to be detached. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of Ursula Garcia's five children, Eickholdt had a 4-year-old son, 
Sergio, as well as three brothers, a sister and a stepfather. She is also 
survived by her father, a resident of Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
Born in West Germany, where her father was stationed in the Army, Karen 
Eickholdt had spent her early years in Michigan and California's central coast. 
For the last 11 years she had lived in Paramount and Compton, and had attended 
Dominguez High School before dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, her mother said, she had been attending night school to earn a high 
school diploma. She had talked of joining the National Guard and eventually 
entering the hotel business. 
</P>
<P>
"She had big plans. She wanted to get into management," her mother said. "She 
was telling me she'd get a home for me and home for herself -- a big one in 
front, and a small one in back for her and Sergio." 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter loved to dance and on nights when she wasn't attending class, 
would go with friends to Mr. J's disco 20 miles away in El Monte, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"She went to El Monte because she felt Compton was too rowdy, too dangerous," 
Eickholdt's godmother, Christina Mercado, said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very fun person," Mercado said. "Always there to help people who 
needed help. A kind person." 
</P>
<P>
Mercado said she is attempting to establish a trust fund for Sergio. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte Police Detective Butch Reyburn said a reward of a still unspecified 
amount is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the killers. 
They were described as Latino men, about 20 years of age. The truck was 
described as a 1964 to 1966 gray step-side pickup with a black left front 
fender, and an old California license plate with yellow numbers and letters 
against a black background. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators asked anyone with information to call El Monte police at (818) 
580-1200 or the sheriff's detectives at (213) 974-4341. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are planning to pass out flyers soliciting information at Mr. J's, 
Reyburn said. It is believed the two suspects may have been patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that," Reyburn said, "we haven't got anything going."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RACES CANCELED FOR LACK OF CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School board candidates in three districts will take office without ever 
appearing on the ballot because no one filed to run against them by the filing 
deadline Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Because they would have appeared on the ballot unopposed during the general 
election in November, the candidates in the three school districts -- 
Brea-Olinda Unified, Los Alamitos Unified and Centralia -- will assume the 
offices, an election official said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, no one filed candidacy papers to fill open seats on two Surfside 
governing boards, which means the County Board of Supervisors will appoint 
members to fill the community services and storm water districts serving the 
gated Seal Beach community, election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In total, 26 of 78 potential local elections this November were canceled 
because of a lack of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
A total of seven races -- the three school board elections, plus four special 
district elections -- were canceled Wednesday. Last week, elections were 
canceled for six school boards and 13 special districts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three school board elections canceled Wednesday, elections 
were called off last week for Saddleback Community College District, Capistrano 
Unified School District, Buena Park School District, Cypress School District, 
La Habra City School District and the Magnolia School District. 
</P>
<P>
Candidacy papers were due at 5 p.m. Wednesday to fill openings on 27 city 
councils, school boards and special districts. The filing deadline was extended 
after the incumbents failed to file for reelection last week. 
</P>
<P>
The filing period for the other local races on the Nov. 6 ballot ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
School board candidates who will assume office without an election are: Barbara 
R. Paxton, homemaker, Brea-Olinda Unified; Keith Polakoff, a graduate-studies 
dean, Los Alamitos Unified; and Karen L. Blake, teacher, Centralia School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates who city and county officials reported filing since Friday for 
the ballot are as follows. 
</P>
<P>
For the Orange mayoral race: Juan Pablo Serrano-Nieblas, environmental 
engineer; E. William Berke, retirement fund consultant/self-employed; Robert 
Boice, businessman/self-employed; Gene Beyer, councilman/retired principal; 
Marshall Norris, retired county official.

HOMEOWNERS DEFEAT APARTMENT COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that their older West Anaheim neighborhood has been overrun by 
apartment developments in recent years, members of a homeowners association 
persuaded the City Council to reject a proposed 334-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Orange Avenue Homeowners Assn. cited increased traffic, noise 
and other ill-effects of overcrowding as reasons to retain the single-family 
orientation of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about density. We're not against people making money on their 
project," said Ruth Good, a member of the group who is also a Magnolia School 
District board member. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 0 against the project, which would have placed a three- 
or four-story building on 9.2 acres on Magnolia Avenue just north of Lincoln 
Avenue. The council also voted unanimously to rezone the property so that fewer 
housing units per lot will be allowed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The group is now gearing up to fight the next major project that residents say 
threatens the quality of life in their neighborhood: a condominium complex that 
would place 17 units on four acres. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got so many apartments. Our area is getting so built up," Good said. 
"Things have just snowballed. I just want my little piece of the pie to still 
have a nice feel to it."

CITY WON'T BACK BILL ON CABLE TV RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seal Beach will not join 10 other Orange County cities in urging Congress to 
pass a bill that would inject new competition into the cable television 
industry while giving cities a stronger hand in regulating local cable 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is considering legislation aimed at reducing cable television rates by 
breaking up local cable monopolies, which have flourished under conditions 
created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. Cities also would 
regain the power to regulate rates. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted Monday not to support the proposed changes to the act 
because the legislation could allow telephone companies to enter the cable 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Council members expressed concern that it would be harder for the city to deal 
with General Telephone than with Comcast Cable, the city's sole cable provider, 
which has a regional office next door to city hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they can operate at the local level," said councilman Joe Hunt 
of large telephone companies such as GTE, which currently are prohibited from 
offering cable services. 
</P>
<P>
Comcast offers extensive local programming, including broadcasts of City 
Council and Planning Commission meetings, a weekly crime prevention and 
interview program hosted by a police officer, and a number of programs produced 
by local residents. Council members said they doubted that GTE could duplicate 
such service. 
</P>
<P>
A GTE spokesman disagreed, saying "I don't see that any of these things would 
ever be lost" if the telephone company was allowed to compete with Comcast in 
Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Further, phone companies will be able to offer high-tech services that cable 
companies cannot match when fiber optic cable replaces copper wire in the next 
five to 10 years, said Thomas Facon, a GTE district manager. 
</P>
<P>
Families would be able to use their television and telephone together to shop 
at home, instantly transmit a video of their child's first steps to a relative, 
and choose movie videos from a menu on their screen and watch them any time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
GTE is experimenting with such "two-way television" services in a pilot project 
in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also worried that allowing GTE to offer cable services could 
reduce the franchise fees that Seal Beach receives because GTE could use its 
telephone business revenue to subsidize its cable service. The city collects 
five cents from Comcast for every dollar the company receives from subscribers. 
Lower cable rates would mean less revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Facon said GTE, even if it wanted to, would not be able to keep its cable rates 
artificially low by charging telephone customers more because telephone rates 
are regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. CHRISTOPHER ADAMS

POLICE IDENTIFY SHOOTING VICTIM

<TEXT>
<P>
A man found shot to death in a Newport Beach townhouse on Tuesday has been 
identified as Roger Hughes, 42, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Helen S. Parser, 49, was arrested on suspicion of murdering Hughes and is being 
held on $250,000 bail, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes and Parser were married in 1984, but police were uncertain about their 
recent marital status. "It's unclear if they had since been divorced," Gonis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said police were alerted to the shooting by a "friend of the suspect's 
who called 911." 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived at the townhouse, on a bluff above Coast Highway, they 
surrounded the building and ordered Parser out of her home. She surrendered 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said it appeared that there had been a struggle between Parser and Hughes 
before the shooting. "The house was in disarray," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parser was taken to a local hospital for examination of some minor bruises, but 
Gonis said she appeared to be in good condition. MATT LAIT

DREARY DAYS ARE LEAVING COUNTY BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY CHABOT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The misty mornings and dreary days that have hung over Orange County for the 
past week are on the way out -- without having provided relief from low water 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
According to meteorologists from WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, weather will start to perk up this weekend, with temperatures rising 
and clouds disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the clouds cooled things off, they did little to alleviate the drought 
that has plagued Orange County for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"For rainfall to make a difference, it has to be significant," said Kathleen 
Cha, spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department. "A little rain really 
doesn't help." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there hasn't been much rain to speak of, said Shai Patel, an 
engineering technician with the Orange County Environmental Management Agency. 
His agency has recorded virtually no rain in the county in the last few days, 
with Villa Park receiving the only rain this month -- less than one-tenth of an 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherData meteorologist Marty McKewon said the clouds and mist over much of 
Orange County are the remnants of hurricane Diana, which touched ground in 
Mexico. Winds from the southeast have pushed lingering moisture toward the 
Southland and, mixed with the marine air, made the past few mornings drizzly. 
</P>
<P>
The dry, relatively cloudless weather Southern California experienced last week 
has moved east, allowing the moisture-laden winds from Mexico to blow in, 
McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherData meteorologist Bill Hibbert said a low-pressure front will move back 
across Northern and Central California this weekend, bringing rain to that 
area, but he said chances were very slim that Orange County would see any of 
that weather.

3 RADIO TOWERS GET SIGNAL OF APPROVAL FROM SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: MANY SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS RESIDENTS CRITICIZED THE PROJECT, WHICH 
WILL MAKE WAY FOR A NEW SPANISH-LANGUAGE RADIO STATION. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite emotional public opposition to a proposal that one Orange County 
Supervisor described as "sort of a crummy project," board members on Wednesday 
unanimously approved construction of three radio transmitting towers in the 
Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Once built, the 306-foot towers will broadcast a new Spanish-language radio 
station, KSRT-AM. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action capped a wrenching session of the board in which a dozen 
residents and environmentalists testified that the towers and diesel generator 
to power them would ruin the serenity they had sought when they bought property 
in the area off Black Star Canyon Road near the Riverside County line. 
</P>
<P>
"Recent events have made it hard for me to think clearly," said Larry Booth, 
46, a property owner in the area who has long fought the towers and whose wife 
died three weeks ago of a heart attack. "My wife's and my life have been in 
utter turmoil because of this proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Booth, who paused and apologized to the board as his voice cracked and he wiped 
away tears, concluded his remarks by telling the supervisors: "If you approve 
this project, the American Dream just went to hell for me." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents expressed strong emotions as well, with some accusing the board 
of backing the proposal because it would benefit Daniel Villanueva Jr., 
president of Orange County Broadcasting Co. and the son of a wealthy and 
well-known Spanish-language television executive. The Villanuevas are 
well-connected politically, and opponents of the project suggested that the 
board was showing them favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have flatly rejected that allegation, and although several of them 
expressed concern about the project Wednesday, ultimately they voted to approve 
a motion by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez supporting construction of the towers 
as long as the operator agrees to 30 conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Given all of this information, I believe, in my opinion, that the appellants' 
concerns have been met," said Vasquez, whose district includes the proposed 
radio towers. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Vasquez cited a condition of the radio towers' construction that 
requires the broadcasting company to vacate the site in eight years if any of 
the nearby property owners builds a home. If no new homes are built near the 
towers, the company would be able to apply for an extension, but Villanueva 
told supervisors that he intends to remove the towers regardless. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors appeared to be reassured by that pledge, which they asked 
Villanueva to repeat for the official record of Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Supervisor Roger R. Stanton expressed deep displeasure with the overall 
proposal and with county staff's role in guiding it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is really, to be blunt, sort of a crummy project that you've 
brought before us," Stanton told county planning administrators. "If anything 
like this is brought before this board again . . . I will not vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton was particularly irritated at county planning director Tom Mathews. 
When Stanton asked Mathews if he had determined whether the public benefits 
from the project were enough to override the concerns of property owners, 
Mathews responded, "To my knowledge, that was not considered." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the audience noted that Orange County, which has a Latino 
population of about 400,000, already is served by 11 Spanish-language radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his reservations, Stanton said he voted for this proposal partly out of 
"personal respect and regard" for Vasquez. Supervisors traditionally adhere to 
the recommendation of the board member whose district is most affected by a 
proposal.

PEOPLE: IT'S STILL THE SPORTING LIFE FOR HIM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At 18, Brad Parks was lying in a hospital bed with two paralyzed legs, the 
result of a skiing accident, wondering what he could do with the rest of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to think of things I could do. I knew I had a life to lead and had to 
make the best of the situation," said Parks, now 33. "I just couldn't sit 
around and be upset." 
</P>
<P>
Now, others in similar circumstances are asking him the same questions he asked 
himself, and he shares his answers with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm a role model for a lot of people," said Parks, who is the founder 
and president of the San Clemente-based National Foundation of Wheelchair 
Tennis and who participates in many other sports. "A lot of people helped me 
out, and I think it's a duty to help others out." 
</P>
<P>
Parks said he really didn't learn to deal with the environment and himself 
until he left the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get out to the real world, you learn from other people who are 
successful while they are in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
Parks, who graduated from Dana Hills High, was a freshman at the University of 
Utah at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
He has since become a champion wheelchair tennis player, a golfer and 
wheelchair marathoner, and continues to scuba dive. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to return to snow skiing, but this time in a sit-down ski set-up. 
He would also like to water ski with the aid of a similar device. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parks likes all sports, he favors tennis. He was the No. 1-ranked 
wheelchair player in the world from 1980 through 1989, and he is now No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Parks, who is married and the father of twin daughters, says, "The No. 1 
thing in my life is my family." 
</P>
<P>
Parks said he learned to use a wheelchair to play sports to stay active. 
</P>
<P>
"All my friends were on their feet, but I could go out and do things like I 
used to do," he said. "And I could go out with my parents." 
</P>
<P>
Wheelchair tennis in particular, he said, "helped make my life better. I 
started to realize the tremendous benefits, both mentally and physically, you 
can get from the game." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he has become fascinated with golf. 
</P>
<P>
He balances himself with a hand-gripped crutch in his left hand and strikes the 
ball with the club in his right. 
</P>
<P>
He plays regulation courses in the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would be able to hit a golf ball 200 yards," he said. "You 
never know what can happen if you try." 
</P>
<P>
Parks is also promoting wheelchair sports camps for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"We created the camp concept because there weren't any good organized sports 
programs for kids in wheelchairs," he said. The camp instructors are in 
wheelchairs "so kids can see that being in a chair doesn't mean the end of the 
active athletic part of life." 
</P>

PROTEST: PARTY STORE OWNER SAYS MINI-MALL WALL BLOCKS ACCESS TO HIS BUSINESS.

<P>
There's the Middle East war. Then there's the San Gabriel war, centered on a 
patch of pavement behind a mini-mall and by a warehouse housing a party 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of bringing in armed soldiers, LA PartyWorks on Wednesday brought 
in the clowns. Dozens of them: mimes in whiteface, a Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtle, Batman and his archrival Penguin, a stilt walker, a Merlin-robed 
magician, clowns on skates and more clowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Block Iraq. Not Our Dock," read one sign. It was a circus, complete with the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The party folks claim the mini-mall operator has shut off access to the 
PartyWorks warehouse, preventing big trucks filled with party gear from going 
in and out. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said mini-mall owner Anna Dong. She has merely put up a fence along her 
property line to protect her tenants and their customers from traffic generated 
by the warehouse, she said. And LA PartyWorks still has a narrow public alley 
that provides access, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police -- called to the scene three times in the last week -- were there again 
Wednesday as the battle off San Gabriel Boulevard near Las Tunas Drive reached 
fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize this isn't going to accomplish our objective," said PartyWorks 
manager Jeff Bader. "But we thought we'd have a little fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
But the jocularity was only on the painted smiles of the clowns, because nasty 
words were exchanged by all. 
</P>
<P>
"They're choking me out of business," said PartyWorks owner Eric Elkaim. 
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable compromise could be reached," said Dong's lawyer, Gene Koon. "But 
this demonstration is overdone and absolutely frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But that didn't stop some stilt-walking diplomacy by 10-foot-tall 
Richard Shope, who bent down to shake hands with Koon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I ever had clowns to contest with before," Koon said.

<P>
It was Nancy Raposo's turn for a Savannah-style welcome Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Raposo of Newport, R.I., pedaled into Rousakis Plaza at 7:06 p.m. (PDT) to win 
the women's division of the Race Across America in 10 days, 10 hours and 6 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of curious passersby, several TV crews and newspaper reporters were on 
hand to watch Raposo finish the 2,922-mile race from Irvine to Savannah. It was 
a scene similar, though a bit smaller, to that which Bob Fourney, the men's 
winner, experienced early Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Raposo, 33, was one of two veterans in the field of six women riders. In 1988, 
she finished third. This year, Raposo was the first woman and 16th finisher 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Marek of Seattle, the other RAAM veteran, passed time station No. 43 at 
Tuskegee, Ala., at 7 p.m. (PDT), in second place. Michelle Grainger of 
Portland, Ore., was in Uniontown, Ala., at 5:58 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Marek had 365.4 miles left to ride and Grainger 488.9. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Penseyres of San Juan Capistrano had fewer than 100 miles left to ride at 9 
p.m. (PDT). He passed Reidsville, Ga., 82.6 miles from Savannah, at 7:02 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He is in 17th place. Because he'll finish more than 48 hours behind Fourney, 
Penseyres will be considered an unofficial finisher. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's finishers with finishing times (EDT): Al Muldoon of St. Joseph, 
Mich., 1:05 a.m. in fourth place; Darrell Bowles (Tempe, Ariz.), 8:14 a.m.;

CHARGER LINEMAN ISN'T INVINCIBLE ANYMORE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: ONE PLAY IN THE 1989 PRESEASON CHANGED DENNIS MCKNIGHT'S THINKING, 
HIS CAREER AND HIS LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis McKnight had begun to think he was indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
For seven seasons, the Chargers put him at center, guard or tackle, and he 
hammered away at the guy on the other side of the line. He wasn't a 
bury-you-to-the-turf type, but he was steady and persistent. Few people reached 
the quarterback by going past McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the 1989 preseason, he had started 77 consecutive games and was a Pro 
Bowl alternate in 1988. The thought never entered his mind that he would do 
anything but play 16 or 17 seasons. And it surely wouldn't be him who was 
knocked out of a game with an injury -- it would be the other guy, the one who 
didn't train as hard as he did. 
</P>
<P>
But one play changed his thinking, his career and his life. In the final 
exhibition against Phoenix last season, McKnight suffered a torn quadriceps 
tendon and was out the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as he slowly begins to rediscover the form that drew attention in 1988, 
thoughts of invincibility are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know," says McKnight, whose Chargers will play the Rams at Anaheim 
Stadium Saturday night. "I know I'm still a good player, but if I don't fit 
into schemes or future plans, then hey, things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight is the only player remaining on this team to have worn a Charger 
uniform in the NFL playoffs. He can tell by looking around him that he isn't 
one of the kids anymore. The other faces are younger, the legs a bit more spry. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel older," he says. "It is a sign that the end is coming. I'm 
appreciating and enjoying things more now. I won't hate practice as much. I 
think when the season starts, I'll enjoy it more." 
</P>
<P>
And that's because he came awfully close to seeing his football career slip 
through his fingers. The night he was hurt, he overheard the doctor whisper: 
"Boy, it's too bad Conan's done." 
</P>
<P>
Conan is the nickname McKnight was given by his teammates for his dedication in 
the weight room. Fittingly, long hours of lifting brought him back to the field 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there was a lot more to deal with than physical training. The hours 
he didn't spend rehabilitating his leg went by slowly. All sorts of thoughts 
came to mind. Could he come back? If not, what then? How would he support his 
family? 
</P>
<P>
"You don't sleep at night, so millions of things run through your head," he 
says. "All of a sudden it's like 'Wow, I'm human.' " 
</P>
<P>
To help him cope with the injury, McKnight's two closest friends on the team, 
Don Macek, who retired at the end of last season, and tackle Joel Patten would 
come by his house after each game and take him out on the town. Football was 
never discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing he needed was not to talk about football," Patten said. "He 
needed to be one of the guys again." 
</P>
<P>
This year, he isn't really one of the guys anymore, and he knows it. The 
younger players stay up at night to watch television or play games. A veteran 
such as McKnight, who has had four knee operations and will be 31 in September, 
needs to store up his stamina for two-a-day workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't have the energy to stay up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The first few days of camp this season weren't kind to McKnight, who worried 
constantly that he wouldn't pick up the new blocking schemes and that he was 
headed for a quick trip to the cut list. His wife, Jodi, and Patten kept 
telling him it was only the first week and that he should be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did," Patten says with a laugh, "was take the gun away." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, things began to fall into place. "That first week I was depressed," 
McKnight says. "But now it's like that didn't even exist. I have my old 
confidence back." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest threat to McKnight's career is Larry Williams, a Plan B free agent 
acquired in March, 1989.

AIRLINES SLASH FARES IN FIGHT FOR PASSENGERS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: NEW, CHEAP RATES ARE A BOON TO CONSUMERS BUT PORTEND A SHAKEOUT IN THE 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Major airlines are doing an about-face this week, leaving potential air 
travelers bewildered -- but happy. 
</P>
<P>
Carriers that only last week announced fare hikes as high as 10% because of 
soaring oil prices suddenly are slashing their domestic ticket prices, 
following the lead of Trans World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The message to consumers, industry executives say, is to buy now but be aware 
that the new fares bear many restrictions and may not be refundable if travel 
plans change. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can live with all the nonsense and all the strings, the fares are 
downright cheap," said George Gosche, owner of Brentana Travel in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
But cheap fares usually bode ill for the airlines. This latest fare cutting is 
a desperate attempt by the industry to boost business in a slow season. That, 
coupled with sharply higher fuel costs, could result in an industry shakeout if 
enough new travelers aren't lured by the lower fares, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're approaching the final battle in the arena. There aren't very many 
Christians left for the lions to eat, so now the lions are eating each other," 
said Morton Beyer, chairman of Avmark, an Arlington, Va.-based airline 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for those who fly was pretty bleak last week when airlines started 
announcing fare hikes and surcharges to cover fuel prices that have jumped 
about 30% since Iraq invaded Kuwait. Fuel costs generally are an airline's 
second biggest expense, after labor. 
</P>
<P>
Some carriers, including American, the nation's largest, responded with plans 
to boost ticket prices as much as 10% beginning this week. But they were forced 
to back off when United Airlines, the No. 2 carrier, and others said they would 
raise fares only 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Monday, TWA and Eastern weighed in with plans to cut fares as much as 
30%. But the fares were available only to the limited number of cities served 
by TWA and Eastern, two of the smaller and weaker of the major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other large airlines responded with price cuts of their own on 
Tuesday and Wednesday and postponed any fuel-related price increases until at 
least next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the lower fares are available for only a limited time and the tickets carry 
several restrictions. They must be purchased by Aug. 29 and used between Sept. 
5 and Dec. 16, except for five days around Thanksgiving, a heavy travel period. 
Many of the tickets cannot be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, people who can't make advance travel plans and stick to them -- and that 
includes most business travelers -- will not be able to take advantage of the 
lower fares and probably will pay higher fuel-boosted prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of sounds crazy that, when fuel prices are going up, fares are coming 
down. But they're not, really. It's just a sale," said Daniel A. Hersh, an 
airline analyst with the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards brokerage firm in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Air travel usually drops about 25% after Labor Day, when the summer vacation 
season ends. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of ticket prices, the sky may be the limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The fuel increases being what they have been, logic would dictate that a fare 
increase has to happen," said Greg Witter, manager of media relations for 
Alaska Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"But the situation is so up and down, it's hard to tell what might happen by 
then," Witter said, referring to Aug. 22, when Alaska is scheduled to reinstate 
its planned 5.3% increase. "We hope it goes into effect without any market 
gyrations and promotions muddying the waters." 
</P>
<P>
TWA spokesman Don Morrison said the carrier cut fares in response to President 
Bush's call to the airline industry to help control fuel-related inflation. TWA 
is waiting for fuel prices to stabilize before deciding on any fare increases, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, with other airlines' fares rising, "we thought it was a tremendous 
opportunity to expose more people to TWA who were holding back because they 
thought fares were going up," Morrison said. The strategy may be working, he 
said, noting that TWA surpassed its old one-day booking record by 30% on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
TWA and Eastern cut fares because they saw an opportunity to grab customers 
from some of the larger and stronger air carriers, and their competitors were 
forced to follow suit, said analyst Robert Decker of Duff &amp; Phelps, a 
Chicago-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The airline industry is so competitive that an airline can't keep a higher 
fare longer than a day because people will snap up the lower fares," he said. 
The temporary fare cuts will hurt the industry if they are extended past 
mid-December and if they don't draw new customers who weren't already planning 
trips, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyer of Avmark said the fare roller coaster "certainly shows the disarray in 
the industry." The last 12 months were the worst ever for the airline industry 
and a prolonged fare war could force weak carriers out of business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some airline executives are not happy about the fare slashing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the brightest thing to do because we're taking a beating" from higher 
fuel prices, said Ed Stewart, spokesman for American Airlines. American's fuel 
costs are expected in jump $720 million this year, to a total of $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Price is how the flying public decides on how to get from Point A to Point B, 
so we had to respond," Stewart said. "The consumer will win, but there is no 
way we can recoup our fuel costs" with the lower ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were flying high on Wednesday at Going Places Travel in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's busy," said manager Pat Gallardo. "Here we were anticipating all these 
fare increases, and the fares are going down." 
</P>
<P>
Gallardo's advice to travelers: Don't wait.

2 IN INSIDER TRADING CASE FINED $37,445 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
An Anaheim stockbroker and a Torrance printing plant worker, who were convicted 
in May on civil charges relating to an insider trading scheme using advance 
information from Business Week magazine, were ordered Wednesday to repay 
$28,655 in illegal profits and fined $37,445. 
</P>
<P>
Brian J. Callahan, a high-profile broker with Prudential-Bache Securities in 
Anaheim before he was fired for his role in the scandal, was ordered to repay 
$1,149 in personal profits and $8,000 in commissions earned on sales to 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles also issued a permanent 
injunction barring Callahan from future securities law violations and ordered 
him to pay a fine of $27,445, or an amount equal to three times his illegal 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
William N. Jackson, a former quality control inspector at the R.R. Donnelley 
printing plant in Torrance, was ordered to give back $19,507 in illegal profits 
and pay a $10,000 fine. He also has been fired from his job. 
</P>
<P>
The case was one of five around the country involving stock transactions based 
on advance knowledge the contents of Business Week's "Inside Wall Street" 
column. Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Christopher Petito said 
three of the other cases have been settled and one is still outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia A. Friedel, an attorney for Callahan, said he would appeal both the 
original verdict and the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorney, Jack Samet, said his client would not appeal. "Given the 
determination of the jury that the conduct was unlawful, we accept as 
reasonable the conclusions of the judge," Samet said. 
</P>
<P>
Samet noted that Jackson was not formally barred from future violations of 
securities laws and interpreted that as an indication that Jackson was "viewed 
by the judge as less culpable." 
</P>
<P>
The SEC had asked that Callahan also be forced to repay nearly $20,000 in 
profits his clients earned between 1987 and 1989 from trades based on the 
inside information. But Petito said the penalty of three times the illegal 
personal profit is the largest allowed under the law and that he believes 
Callahan is the first defendant ever to be subject to that sanction. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said during the trial that he did not believe he was doing anything 
wrong by using information from "Inside Wall Street." He would call Callahan 
after the magazine had been printed but before it hit the streets and order 
stocks based on what was in the column. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan maintained that he did not know where Jackson worked and that he had 
no idea that the stock tips were coming from Business Week. Attorneys for the 
defendants also argued that in any case, the information did not truly 
constitute insider information. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC countered that Donnelley kept its workers well informed of the law and 
that Callahan was fully aware of the origins of Jackson's information.

6 New Wet Seals: Wet Seal, the high-fashion store for women, continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The chain said it opened six new stores this month, including a newly expanded 
outlet at the Orange Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Three of its new stores are in Florida, where the chain's officials are hoping 
that the store's youthful appeal and sunbaked image will catch on. They also 
have new stores in Hawaii and in Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
Wet Seal, founded as a little Balboa Island shop in the 1950s, has opened five 
other locations since March and expanded three others. The openings come on the 
heels of Wet Seal's initial public stock offering in July. The company raised 
about $43 million in the offering, which it is using to repay loans, upgrade 
the company's computer system, and expand its Irvine distribution center and a 
number of stores.

WAY CLEAR FOR FUNDAMERICA TO FILE CHAPTER 11; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE DENIES A REQUEST THAT THE COMPANY BE PLACED IN RECEIVERSHIP. 
THE FIRM SAID IT HAS LAID OFF 114 ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES. 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge in San Francisco declined Wednesday to place Irvine-based 
FundAmerica Inc. in receivership, clearing the way for the beleaguered company 
to file a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The court action came just hours after FundAmerica, which is under 
investigation by regulators in four states for operating a possible pyramid 
scheme, said it has laid off 114 of its 172 employees in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the layoffs are the result of "significant legal, regulatory 
and business problems." The layoffs will leave the company with only its 
executive and administrative staffs, Sandi Sternberg, a company spokeswoman, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel denied a request by 
plaintiffs in a $150-million, class-action lawsuit against FundAmerica to have 
the company be placed under court-appointed receivership. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica gave notice on Tuesday that it intended to seek protection from 
creditors in Chapter 11. The firm also said that it would ask the bankruptcy 
judge "to appoint an independent examiner to investigate the various 
allegations made against the company." 
</P>
<P>
Patel said Wednesday that a declaration of receivership, which would have 
immediately removed financial control of the company from its owners, would 
usurp the authority of the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg said the company did not file a bankruptcy petition Wednesday because 
attorneys were awaiting the outcome of the receivership request. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, FundAmerica could potentially continue to 
operate under its current owners. Daniel Girard, an attorney for the 
plaintiffs, acknowledged that there is no assurance that the bankruptcy court 
would approve a trusteeship, but he noted that Patel had recommended that a 
trustee be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Patel granted the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction that freezes 
FundAmerica's assets and marketing efforts until a trustee is appointed to 
supervise the company in bankruptcy proceedings. She also approved the status 
of the suit -- filed by former FundAmerica members -- as a class action, Girard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Patel ruled that it was up to the bankruptcy court to decide if FundAmerica was 
inherently fraudulent. However, she denied the company's request for minimal 
funds to "keep the lights on" while it attempts to reorganize, citing the 
weight of evidence against it. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how this particular kind of what can be referred to charitably as 
a 'multilevel marketing scheme' can, in fact, pass muster under federal 
security or state laws," Patel said. "It appears, based on what I see . . . 
that it is an illegal pyramid scheme found to be in violation of security and 
state laws." 
</P>
<P>
Under receivership, the company's financial operations and assets are strictly 
monitored by a court-appointed trustee not associated with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg said the layoffs will affect nearly all non-managerial employees. She 
declined to comment on the judge's action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ship sinking fast," said Susan Henrichsen, deputy state attorney 
general in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg said the company won't be able to pay employees' salaries or benefits 
without court approval. 
</P>
<P>
The company disclosed two weeks ago that its former President, Robert T. 
Edwards, was paid a salary of $1 million a month this year and recently wired 
$11.3 million to two entities overseas. Edwards has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the California, Florida and Washington state attorneys general 
have testified in Patel's court that FundAmerica is operating an illegal 
pyramid scheme and asked the judge to appoint a receiver to protect the public 
and FundAmerica's assets. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Florida fined Fund-America $8 million on fraud allegations and 
ordered the company to cease doing business in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Florida authorities filed criminal fraud charges last week against FundAmerica 
and Edwards, alleging that they bilked state residents out of $8.2 million. If 
convicted of the charges, Edwards could be sentenced to more than 65 years in 
prison and fined up to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company has denied the allegations and says it is a legitimate, multilevel 
marketing firm. It has accused the Florida officials of malicious prosecution.

'GARBOLOGIST'S LIFE IS IN THE PITS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ARCHEOLOGIST BILL RATHJE EXCAVATES LANDFILLS, NOT RUINS, AND CALLS 
PLASTIC THE 'GREAT SATAN.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Rathje is an archeologist, but not one to be found excavating ancient 
Mayan civilizations, Egyptian tombs or East Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
He prefers to dig up more current, less glamorous ruins, what he calls "the 
pimples on Mother Nature's face." 
</P>
<P>
A more accurate term for Rathje might be "garbologist" because he has been 
digging up garbage in landfills nationwide for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Rathje says he has seen it all -- all of America's fast-food waste, disposable 
diapers, Styrofoam cups, plastic soda bottles, cans full of paint, broken 
furniture and assorted other oddments. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting his Garbage Project, Rathje said, he has learned that people often 
mount campaigns against the least threatening environmental scourges and ignore 
more serious threats to landfills bursting at their clay-lined seams. 
</P>
<P>
Rathje, a professor at the University of Arizona, recently addressed 
waste-management companies and First Analysis Corp., a Chicago research firm 
that focuses on the environmental industry. 
</P>
<P>
He called plastics "the Great Satan" but said Americans should be more aware of 
materials such as paper and construction and demolition waste that take far too 
much valuable landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
"Landfills close down not because they're too heavy but because there's too 
much volume," he said. Volume? The only man-made structure larger than Staten 
Island's Fresh Kills landfill is the Great Wall of China, Rathje said, and at 
2.3 billion cubic feet and counting, the landfill will be bigger than the wall 
by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Despite what many people think, Rathje said, plastics have taken up no more 
than 12 to 13% of landfill space since 1975, although production of plastic 
packaging and products is booming. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that plastics are becoming increasingly lighter, he said, 
noting that a plastic milk jug now weighs about 45% less than in the early 
1970s. Plastic grocery bags, 2-liter soft-drink containers, laundry detergent 
jugs and even glass are lighter. 
</P>
<P>
A glass bottle unearthed in a 1950s landfill often is whole and unbroken, 
whereas lighter-weight glass in current landfills is in pieces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Diapers, which account for 1.8% of volume in landfills, are not the 
bacteria-producing waste that people suspect, Rathje said. Rather, newly added 
super-absorbent material contains all leachable toxic materials in landfills. 
"But since they're super absorbent, they're going to come in heavier and 
smellier anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paper that filled 40% of landfill space in 1970 now fills 55%, and that 
percentage is growing. Newspapers, office wastepaper and especially telephone 
books are the culprits. Dig a trench in a landfill, Rathje said, and one can 
see phone books layered like a cake. Lacking light, air and space in a packed 
landfill, they do not deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
"Each two-volume set of Yellow Pages distributed in Phoenix last year, which 
will be thrown out this year, weighed 8.63 pounds, for a total of 6,000 tons of 
wastepaper, and that's only one city," Rathje said. "The phone companies even 
throw out their old books and put everything on microfilm." 
</P>
<P>
Calculating exactly how much garbage Americans generate is an "imprecise 
exercise," and numbers may vary, said Marge Franklin, president of Franklin 
Associates Ltd., an environmental engineering and research firm in Prairie 
Village, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Franklin Associates report this year for the Environmental 
Protection Agency, paper accounted for 34% and plastic 20% of landfill volume 
nationally in 1988, a slight difference from Rathje's figures, based on 
excavations at nine landfills nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is that one method is computed systematically, and Rathje's is 
empirical," said Sam Hartwell, a research associate at the Natural Resources 
Defense Council in New York. "Volumes may be over or underestimated because of 
many variables, but a more important finding of Rathje's is that, even though 
something like plastic and paper may be labeled biodegradable, they're really 
not once they get in a landfill because they can be dug up years later still 
intact." 
</P>
<P>
To probe a landfill, Rathje uses a bucket auger with a 110-foot pole. At the 
pole's base is a bucket four feet high and three feet wide with steel teeth to 
grab a cookie-cutter portion of garbage. The first time Rathje used the device, 
he said, it bit through part of a car, engine and all. 
</P>
<P>
The Garbage Project employs standard archeological procedure when the bucket 
dumps its first mouthful. The temperature is taken -- garbage usually is 
between 90 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit because of the depth -- and it is 
weighed. A sample is bagged and mailed to laboratories, universities and 
government agencies that study decomposition traits and bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
The time when garbage was dumped usually can be ascertained quickly, Rathje 
noted, by checking the dates on about two dozen clean newspapers found in 
virtually every load. Other items are not so easily recognized. 
</P>
<P>
On one dig, Rathje said, he thought he had gone "back on some 'Star Trek' time 
warp and was dealing with hand axes from North Africa about a million years 
ago." Analyzed, the two round, dark, rock-like objects were found to be kaiser 
rolls. Newspapers found nearby were dated 1952. The most abundant and intact 
food found in landfills, Rathje said, is the hot dog, adding, "There's 
something to say for all those preservatives."

TALES FROM THE TRUMP; 
</P>
<P>
PART TWO OF THE DONALD'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY REVEALS SOME OF HIS TRIBULATIONS BUT 
PROVES HE STILL REVELS IN HIS 'TOUGH GUY' IMAGE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe you thought the time had come for Donald the midlife philosopher, the 
contemplative loner struggling heroically to bring a simple perspective to his 
highly chronicled life. 
</P>
<P>
Well, as they say in New York, fawgetaboutit. 
</P>
<P>
Just as his marriage, his business and that most cherished of his possessions, 
his name, appear to be in various stages of spectacular destruction, Donald 
Trump has provided a breathless nation with the second volume of his 
autobiography, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," written with Newsweek senior 
writer Charles Leerhsen. 
</P>
<P>
The book, published by Random House, which was rushing 500,000 copies to stores 
on Wednesday, delivers the same sophisticated evaluation of life's trials, 
temptations and rewards as the wildly best-selling first volume, "The Art of 
the Deal." And in a chapter heartwarmingly titled "Trump vs. Trump, Undoing the 
Deal," it also delivers Ivana ("My marriage, it seemed, was the only area of my 
life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection") and 
Marla ("The beautiful young actress who bore the brunt of the hysterical 
publicity, is a terrific person, but my relationship with her was not the cause 
of the trouble between Ivana and me"). 
</P>
<P>
The Donald writes that he is in pain over the end of his marriage. He racked 
his formidable brains trying to find a way to salvage this particular deal. 
"This was by no means a snap judgment. I've discussed the situation with many 
people. I even thought, briefly, about approaching Ivana with the idea of an 
'open marriage.' But I realized there was something hypocritical and tawdry 
about such an arrangement that neither of us could live with -- especially 
Ivana. She's too much of a lady." 
</P>
<P>
For a book that could properly be devoted to Chapter 11, the real one, which 
would be titled "The Art of Filing for Bankruptcy," The Donald sure does have a 
rosy way of looking at what others view as his economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three years have been a time of extraordinary challenges -- success 
and setbacks," Trump writes at the outset, describing what he calls the 
foundation of "Phase Two," of his life. "I bought and restored to greatness the 
Plaza Hotel, a New York landmark. I acquired the run-down Eastern Shuttle and 
made it, as the Trump Shuttle, the best airline of its kind. I erected the 
magnificent Taj Mahal, one of the largest casino-hotels in the world -- and a 
project that many experts predicted could never be completed." 
</P>
<P>
All true. Yet there are other truths left unexplored in these pages. Most hotel 
experts and financiers were astonished at how much Trump paid for the Plaza, 
which has been hemorrhaging money so fast that advisers have urged Trump to 
unload the debt-laden property. He has been desperately beating the bushes for 
somebody to take the money-losing shuttle off his hands. And then there is the 
Taj. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's most remarkable monument to himself, with its 3,000 slot machines and 
167 gaming tables, implanted in a gaudily splendid Eurocash setting, has 
boosted the casino capacity of Atlantic City by 20% since it opened, stealing 
clients from his other casinos and teetering mightily in the Northeast's 
failing economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
Just Tuesday, The Donald agreed to take on Stephen F. Bollenbach, a nationally 
known expert in bailing out troubled companies, as chief financial officer of 
the Trump Organization. Not the move of a man clutching the scepter of power 
with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
But Trump is still tough. He is appalled by America's decline, and he has bad 
words for the Japanese (he describes with relish an incident in which he threw 
a rude Japanese businessman out of his office). In a prescient bit of analysis 
written long before the current crisis, he calls it "brilliant" that Saudi 
Arabia and Kuwait, "countries in which many people live in mansions," stand by 
and allow us to police the Persian Gulf for them. 
</P>
<P>
Germans have treated us worse than anyone else, according to Trump. "For two 
generations American troops have provided security for West Germany against the 
Soviets, but if an American tried to sell a pencil on the street in Germany, 
the authorities would practically throw him in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Trump also has a lot to say about celebrities he has encountered. Frank Sinatra 
horrified Ivana and Donald at a dinner one night in Monte Carlo by being 
boorishly rude to his wife and then treating his fans as if they were scum. 
</P>
<P>
Since you can't libel a dead man, Trump really goes to town on Malcolm Forbes. 
He says they never had a good relationship, in part he thinks because his "more 
luxurious 282-foot yacht," the Trump Princess, came along and stole the 
spotlight from Forbes's formerly legendary 150-foot mini-vessel. But it is 
Forbes's way of life that eventually got under Trump's skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I gradually came to see him as a hypocrite who favored those who advertised in 
his magazine and tried, with surprising viciousness, to punish those who 
didn't. I also saw a double standard in the way he lived openly as a homosexual 
-- which he had every right to do -- but expected the media and his famous 
friends to cover for him." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that, a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
But The Donald that emerges from this memoir is a man caught in pursuit of an 
unreachable goal. Pleasure eludes him, relaxation is inconceivable. He says 
people mistakenly call him greedy because of the way he has amassed real 
estate, companies, helicopters, planes and yachts during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"But what those critics don't know is that the same assets that excite me in 
the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. I probably visited 
Mar-a-Lago, my 118-room house in Palm Beach, no more than two dozen times in 
the years I've owned it. As for my yacht, the Trump Princess, it is a dazzling 
trophy and a terrific business tool, but it never really became part of my 
personal life." 
</P>
<P>
We may be seeing a whole new Trump for Volume 3. He says celebrity takes its 
toll on a man, and points to Howard Hughes, a wealthy man who led a slightly 
less public life than Trump has so far. 
</P>
<P>
"The Howard Hughes story is fascinating to me because it shows that it's 
possible to fall very far very fast. As time goes on, I find myself thinking 
more and more about (Hughes) and even, to some degree, identifying with him." 
</P>
<P>
So one of these days maybe The Donald will decide to slip into a suite at the 
Plaza and just stay there, another celebrity running from the crowd that adores 
him.

HOW TO ADOPT A BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caution! Walking along Orange County's coastline can be hazardous to your 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Shards of glass jut out from the shoreline, poised to puncture an unsuspecting 
instep. Sharp slivers of metal, hidden beneath sand, await a heel digging in to 
chase a volleyball, Frisbee or smash ball. Plastic debris -- including six-pack 
holders, garbage bags and sandwich baggies -- is everywhere, despite the hazard 
it poses to ocean animals mistaking plastic for food. 
</P>
<P>
To combat the forces of garbage overtaking the California coastline, the 
California Coastal Commission has created a statewide Adopt-A-Beach Program, 
which relies on volunteers pitching in to remove trash from the beaches. Any 
person or group can adopt a section of the beach to clean three times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 31,332 items of garbage were collected from Orange County beaches, 
according to Lisa Hybarger, spokeswoman for the Coastal Commission. Only about 
10% of the trash gathered was recyclable glass and aluminum cans. Another 75% 
of the beach debris that volunteers dredged from the sand was plastic. 
Cigarette butts and other miscellaneous trash made up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide Coastal Cleanup Day is planned for next Saturday. On that day, 
everyone who has adopted a beach and anyone else who is interested is invited 
to get together for a day of cleaning up and enjoying one of Orange County's 
most valuable natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To adopt a beach: 
</P>
<P>
* Contact the public information office of the state Coastal Commission in 
Sacramento and request an Adopt-A-Beach application and adoption agreement. The 
phone number is (415) 543-8555. 
</P>
<P>
* The Coastal Commission will verify that the beach you (or your group) has 
chosen is adoptable, or the commission may suggest another beach that needs 
adopting. 
</P>
<P>
* Upon receiving the completed adoption agreements, the Coastal Commission will 
register your group as the adopter of that beach. 
</P>
<P>
* Contact the beach manager at your adopted beach listed below. All future 
cleanup dates, location and logistics for beach cleanups will be coordinated 
with the beach manager.

NEW DISNEY MINORITY HIRING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
FELLOWSHIPS: THE STUDIO SAYS IT WILL HIRE 27 WRITERS FOR A YEARLONG PROGRAM 
INVOLVING ITS THREE DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The movie studio that ranked at the bottom of two consecutive surveys on job 
opportunities for minority writers is now pursuing one of the most aggressive 
minority hiring programs that Hollywood has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Studios said it soon will announce the names of 27 writers -- all 
of whom are African American, Latino, Asian American or women -- who have been 
selected for a new writing fellowship program. The writers will be assigned to 
work with the studio's creative teams. Each will be paid a salary of $30,000 
for a year's work and training, and the group will be divided among the 
studio's three divisions: Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone Pictures and Walt 
Disney Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope is that we'll be able to develop first-rate screenwriters," said 
Cheryl Hill, the Hollywood Pictures creative executive who heads the program. 
The 27 finalists were recruited from more than 2,000 applicants from around the 
country who submitted screenplays, said Hill. "If we happen to produce 
something they write, they'll be compensated additionally." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's efforts drew praise from civil-rights groups and the Writers Guild of 
America West, which had conducted the surveys of job opportunities for minority 
writers in 1987 and 1989. Both surveys showed that writers were being shut out 
of the market because of age, sex and ethnicity, said Jeff Wallace, WGAW human 
resources coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"In '87 and '89, Disney came in the worst," Wallace said in an interview 
Wednesday. "It's refreshing to see them take this aggressive approach." 
Wallace, who has been with the Writers Guild since 1986, said Disney's is the 
first such program of its scale. "Some of the studios have responded with 
pro-active suggestions, and others have yet to respond." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Warner Bros. had a similar program in the 1970s on a much smaller 
scale and that 20th Century Fox has made an effort to employ minority writers 
on its episodic TV shows. "Not to belittle the efforts of any of the other 
companies, but so far, Disney is the only company to come to us with a program 
of this size. Disney just took the lead." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace commended Disney for not only "responding to the problem with bucks, 
but with sending other types of messages (to the entertainment industry). They 
sent letters to agents asking for more material representing ethnic 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
No one contacted by The Times on Wednesday could recall a similar-size effort, 
and most termed the program unprecedented in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The American Film Institute's Willard Rodgers, who has headed that 
organization's Alumni Assn. Writers Workshop since its founding in 1979, said 
he didn't think "any studio in the history of the business has ever had that 
many minority writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was skeptical at first," he said about the studio's dedication. "But I think 
they've gotten first-class writers." Rodgers noted that three or four of the 
individuals may be from his own AFI workshop. Disney, he said, "has to be 
commended very highly." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's program will begin amid a backdrop of heightened awareness of job 
opportunities -- or the lack thereof -- for minorities and women in the film 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
In early July, the Beverly Hills/Hollywood Chapter of the Nation Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People issued a report suggesting that there are fewer 
opportunities for blacks in Hollywood executive suites now than there were 10 
years ago. Chapter president Sandra Evers-Manly said the report was based on 
surveys and talks with all the major studios. She anticipates issuing a "report 
card" for each company's recruitment activities beginning this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Evers-Manly called the Disney program "encouraging and a start in the right 
direction" to correcting the situation for groups "who have not been 
traditionally hired. It will show that there has been an abundance of talent 
that has not been previously recognized." 
</P>
<P>
Evers-Manly credited Disney "for making a commitment that says, 'Hey, when the 
next report comes out, we don't want to be last again.' " 
</P>
<P>
A lack of opportunity for women on screen was documented in a Screen Actors 
Guild report issued Aug. 1, showing startling decreases in both women's roles 
and relative income. In 1989, it said, 71 percent of all roles in feature films 
and 64 percent of all roles in TV went to men. 
</P>
<P>
At the convention of the National Assn. of Black Journalists earlier this 
month, the subject of "Blacks in Hollywood" also was a topic for a panel of 
entertainment figures, many of whom concluded that blacks must not rely on the 
studios to advance their image and economic status. 
</P>

However, Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the panelists, said 
he believed that the major entertainment companies "must change the way we do 
business and (must) create opportunity." He acknowledged the company's previous 
poor record and said Disney management had made correcting it a priority. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's Hill attributed the push for establishing the fellowship to 
Katzenberg's "real aggressive position" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
She said the names of the individuals chosen will be announced at a later date. 
They will report to work Sept. 17.

PICTURES ON NEWSCAST FUEL FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: FCC TAKES ACTION AFTER A COMPLAINT BY THE AMERICAN FAMILY ASSN. 
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT PHOTOS ARE PART OF A MAPPLETHORPE SHOW.

A collection of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs -- already a lightning rod for 
controversy in four cities -- has acquired a new dimension with disclosure that 
the Federal Communications Commission is reviewing a complaint against a Boston 
public-television station for airing several sexually explicit Mapplethorpe 
images. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC said that it initiated an inquiry Tuesday into the broadcast of the 
Mapplethorpe images by WGBH-TV in Boston as a result of a complaint by the 
American Family Assn., a Tupelo, Miss., Christian organization led by the Rev. 
Donald E. Wildmon. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint accuses the broadcast of being both obscene and indecent. 
Existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents have consistently held that obscenity is 
not protected under the First Amendment. Indecent material, although 
constitutionally protected, can be curtailed to prevent minors from exposure, 
the court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Brass, WGBH's corporate counsel, denied Wildmon's allegations, saying that 
the broadcast was "not legally obscene, nor would I think there's any reason to 
believe it would be harmful." 
</P>
<P>
The Wildmon organization touched off an ongoing controversy over the National 
Endowment for the Arts in April of last year when it complained about federal 
support for an exhibit that included an image of a crucifix immersed in urine 
by New York photographer Andres Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC said that Wildmon's complaint, dated Aug. 7, was received at commission 
offices on Monday. The agency said it began processing the case Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures broadcast by WGBH on its 10 p.m. newscast July 31 are part of "The 
Perfect Moment," a Mapplethorpe show that had already roused controversy in 
Washington, Philadelphia, Cincinnati and in Boston when fundamentalists and 
other political conservatives attempted to have law enforcement officials 
prosecute the gallery showing it on smut charges. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon's three-page letter to the FCC said that "seven of the photographs that 
were the subject of the broadcast have been alleged to be obscene and are 
currently the subject of a criminal indictment in Cincinnati." He apparently 
referred to a pending state court prosecution in Ohio in which the Cincinnati 
Contemporary Arts Center and its director face obscenity and child pornography 
charges in connection with a display of "The Perfect Moment" earlier this year. 
The judge in the Cincinnati case has set an Aug. 24 hearing to set a trial 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon specifically described two allegedly homoerotic photographs in his 
letter, contending that "the photographs were not held up for their artistic 
merit, but rather for their individual and collective ability to 'shock' the 
viewer." 
</P>
<P>
According to Roger Holberg, supervisory attorney for the FCC's mass media 
bureau, the Wildmon complaint was judged appropriate for FCC action, unlike two 
previous letters it received criticizing the WGBH broadcast. The decision to 
initiate the review was taken because, he said, Wildmon included all the 
necessary components to process a complaint -- including a videotape of the 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
The WGBH program devoted most of its coverage that night to controversial art, 
according to Alan Foster, executive producer of news at WGBH, because of a 
then-current Mapplethorpe exhibit at the Institute of Contemporary Art in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Foster denied Wildmon's accusations of obscenity and sensationalism, saying 
that the First Amendment and a previous FCC policy that considered the period 
between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. to be suitable for indecent material both apply to 
the Mapplethorpe broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it a mature treatment, it was intelligent. . . . It did more than 
titilate," Foster said. "The question I feel is fundamental is not why we did 
air it, but why others did not. The media's covering us as if we did something 
wrong, but they haven't been able to treat (the Mapplethorpe photos) with 
intelligence. . . . We feel strongly that knowledge of the photos is what was 
lacking in public debate." 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon said in his complaint that WGBH, "knowing the harmful nature of the 
material, presented several 'disclaimers' regarding the airing of the 
material." He contended, however, that the warnings were insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
A court ruling is pending on the constitutionality of a 24-hour ban on indecent 
program material recently promulgated by the FCC. The FCC decision barring 
indecent programming was cited by Wildmon as a major ground for his complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon was unavailable Wednesday, but AFA lawyer Peggy Coleman said that the 
complaint was more motivated by WGBH's actions than by the fact that 
Mapplethorpe photos were involved. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not done in respect to the NEA or Mapplethorpe," Coleman said. "The 
AFA has participated in regular complaints against obscene broadcasting for the 
past several years."

$1.5-MILLION ART DONATION TO SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
PHILANTHROPY: FREDERICK R. WEISMAN PROMISES TO GIVE MUSEUM 33 WORKS BY 
CALIFORNIA ARTISTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
A collection of 33 works by California artists worth about $1.5 million has 
been promised to the San Diego Museum of Art by Frederick R. Weisman, a 
prominent Los Angeles collector. 
</P>
<P>
Final agreements are expected to be signed in the next few days, according to 
Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"While the agreement is not signed yet, it certainly looks very favorable. It 
appears as though it will happen," Hopkins said, adding that no money is 
attached to the gift. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's board of directors accepted the terms of the gift at a meeting 
late Tuesday, museum director Steven Brezzo said. Conditions of the gift 
include a promise that the works will be on view at all times in a special 
gallery in the Balboa Park museum to be designated as the Frederick R. Weisman 
Gallery for California Art. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, the museum would be permitted to occasionally 
sell works of art from the collection, but any funds derived from sales would 
be designated for additional purchases of works by contemporary California 
artists, Brezzo said. Any new acquisitions would become a part of the Weisman 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins expressed cautious optimism about the gift. 
</P>
<P>
"If it transpires, it would be wonderful from my perspective because we feel 
that San Diego, along with San Francisco and Los Angeles, are the major art 
centers in California, and the one that doesn't have a strong representation of 
California artists is San Diego" Hopkins said. "We hope that this will mean 
that now all the cities will have strong collections of California art on view 
at all times." 
</P>
<P>
All that remains to complete the arrangements is for museum officials and 
Weisman to sign the contracts, Brezzo said. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman, who was unavailable for comment, is widely regarded as one of 
California's most prominent collectors of contemporary and modern works of art. 
His personal and corporate art collections include more than 1,500 artworks, 
valued at up to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed gift to the San Diego Museum of Art includes paintings, sculptures 
and mixed-media works by 33 artists, according to Weisman's curator, Nora 
Halpern Brougher. "They are all major works. It's really a wonderful 
collection," Brougher said. Pieces in the proposed donation were assembled by 
Weisman and not selected by the San Diego museum, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among prime works to be donated are one of Robert Irwin's untitled acrylic 
discs, a highly regarded example of California "Light/Space" art; John 
Baldessari's conceptual work, "Horizontal Men"; and a "Suitcase" assemblage by 
Bruce Connor. Works by Sam Francis, David Hockney, Joe Goode, Edward Ruscha, 
Chuck Arnoldi, Lita Albuquerque, Billy Al Bengston, Alexis Smith and Tim Ebner 
are also in the gift. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the San Diego gift have been in progress since early spring 
according to Brezzo. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art and the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento were also 
considered for the gift, according to a source close to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I had congenial discussions with Henry Hopkins three or four months ago. We 
would have been pleased to get those works and integrate them into our 
collection even though we already have fine examples by most of the artists," 
said Earl A. Powell, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
But Weisman wanted the collection to be kept intact in a separate gallery and 
to be on view at all times. "We don't do that," Powell said. "We integrate our 
collections, so we encouraged the foundation to give the works to a museum that 
could really benefit from the collection. I think it's great for San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Crocker curator Janice Driesbach said that she knew nothing of a proposed 
Weisman gift, but she said that Weisman had toured the museum with director 
Barbara Gibbs, who was out of town and couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hopkins, Weisman has also said he will donate individual works and 
small portions of the collection to other museums throughout the United States, 
including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Other gifts would be 
smaller than that promised to the San Diego Museum, Hopkins said. Weisman, a 
car importer and real-estate magnate, began collecting art in 1952 with his 
former wife, Marcia, also a prominent Los Angeles collector. Marcia Weisman's 
brother, Norton Simon, is an internationally acclaimed collector whose 
collection of Old Masters, Impressionist and Asian art is housed at the Norton 
Simon Museum in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Hopkins, former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern 
Art, Weisman continues to collect art for the foundation. He also buys for 
himself, although the two collections are kept separate. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman, who is 78, has been looking for a home for his collection since the 
mid-1980s. He first tried to form a museum in his name that would keep the full 
collection intact and considered several locations. The most promising 
possibility was the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, but Weisman abandoned 
that plan in 1986 when the Beverly Hills City Council began discussing the 
possibility of selling the mansion to raise money for schools. 
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Greystone deal, the foundation has focused on 
programs in the visual arts rather than searching for a home. One project was a 
symposium on international art fairs, held last December in conjunction with 
Los Angeles' fourth annual art fair. In July, Weisman brought a group of Soviet 
artists and critics to New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman is currently fighting a buyout of Mid-Atlantic Toyota by Toyota Motor 
Sales U.S.A., the Torrance-based subsidiary of Japan's largest auto maker. 
Weisman established Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors Inc. in 1970, when 
Japanese importers began to sell cars through independent distributors, but the 
Japanese have subsequently bought out most of those distributors to cut costs. 
Mid-Atlantic is one of only three independent Toyota distributorships remaining 
in the United States. The company had sales of $1.2 billion in 1989 and sold 
82,462 Toyotas, more than 9% of Toyota's total U.S. sales.

CASTING CALL STILL A WHISPER; 
</P>
<P>
HIRING: THE 'MISS SAIGON' CONTROVERSY HAS BARED THE BITTERNESS AMONG ACTORS AND 
ACTRESSES OF COLOR OVER THE INEQUITIES THEY SEE IN FILM, THEATER AND TELEVISION 
CASTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Ernest Harada was 14 and living in far off Hawaii when the musical 
"Flower Drum Song" premiered in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The first big Broadway musical with a large Asian-American cast, "Flower Drum" 
was set in San Francisco's Chinatown. The plot featured a timid "picture bride" 
just off the boat from China, her traditionalist parents, young Americanized 
friends and the usual romantic crises of an American musical. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager played the show's cast album over and over, until he knew all the 
songs. The stars of the show -- James Shigeta, Nancy Kwan, Jack Soo -- became 
legends for the young Harada, who is today helping to lead a protest that, 
ironically, is keeping dozens of Asian actors off a Broadway stage. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Flower Drum Song' was absolutely wonderful," Harada, now 45, remembers, 
"because for the first time I had Asians to look up to as Broadway stars." 
</P>
<P>
But there were not many big shows for Asians on the stages of New York after 
that -- only Stephen Sondheim's "Pacific Overtures," which ran for 193 
performances in New York in 1976 and toured Boston, San Francisco and Los 
Angeles -- and in which Harada was a key player. 
</P>
<P>
"Shogun" -- based on James Clavell's novel of 17th Century Japan -- is 
currently in previews in Washington. And, until last week, Cameron Mackintosh's 
much anticipated, and now much debated, "Miss Saigon" promised to be one of the 
high points of the coming theater season. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, "Miss Saigon" is likely to be remembered as the musical that 
raised the curtain on what many see as a show business color code, baring a 
deep bitterness among actors and actresses of color over Broadway's and 
Hollywood's long history of hiring white men and women to play the roles of 
Asians, Indians, blacks and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can stop 'yellowface' in the lead roles unless we take a 
stand," says Harada, president of the Assn. of Asian Pacific American Artists, 
"and this is the one that the union finally agreed with us on. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an old, old, old battle, and it's a precedent that the union has come 
around and said, 'We'll support the minority artist.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Mackintosh, the British producer of the London hit "Miss 
Saigon," canceled next spring's Broadway premiere of the musical when Actors' 
Equity vetoed the casting of Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce in the lead role of the 
Eurasian Engineer, a pimp in a Saigon brothel. With the dearth of leading roles 
for minorities in mind, some members of the union objected to a white actor 
playing a minority role and petitioned the union to forbid Pryce from 
recreating his role in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The 39,000-member union has come under tremendous criticism in the last week, 
and after receiving a petition to re-evaluate its position signed by more than 
150 union members in good standing, its governing council is scheduled to 
reconsider the veto at a meeting today. Harada and other Asian-American actors 
sent the union a statement saying in part, "do not waver; do not falter. There 
are more important moral and social issues at stake." 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Saigon" would have provided at least 34 jobs for Asian Americans and 
other minority actors, and that's one of the arguments used by those, including 
some Asian American actors, who oppose the Actor's Equity veto. Still, 
Asian-American actor Darrell Kunitomi says "that argument of 'lost employment' 
doesn't hold water." 
</P>
<P>
"The roles we are allegedly losing," he says, "are about a dozen prostitutes, 
bar girls -- they're just lost crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
"The other 'crumby' parts we lost" he says, "are Viet Cong soldiers who serve 
as window-dressing and extras, like the classic spear-carriers in a Shakespeare 
play. When they try to minoritize TV and films that's what they give us -- the 
crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
According to actors' unions representatives, minorities are underrepresented in 
the entertainment world in comparison to their percentages of the national 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Although the non-white ethnic groups in the 1989 census estimates made up 22.5% 
of the American population, the Screen Actors Guild says that only 15%-16% of 
film and television jobs went to minority actors, slightly up from 14.3% in 
1987. Roles in commercials for the guild's minority actors, according to the 
guild's latest 1987 figures, amounted to 12% of all guild commercials jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The guild, which counts 8,250 minorities among its 62,500 membership says the 
employment outlook is improving for minority actors. But, according to the 
guild's affirmative action administrator, Rodney Mitchell, change is coming at 
"an almost glacier-like pace." 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the improvement is in the increase of roles for ethnic males," 
says Mitchell. "Ethnic females continue to have a difficult time securing 
employment." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Park, a 28-year-old Asian-American actor, recently played the irate 
Korean fruit vendor in Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing." Soon after, he was 
cast in Bill Murray's "Quick Change" as another Korean fruit vendor. "I 
thought, hey maybe I've hit the Korean fruit market circuit," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's frustrating to Park that "Korean fruit market vendors are the new 
Asian paradigm; they're something easily identifiable and easily replaceable in 
a way. . . . The unfortunate thing is: look at a soap opera, for instance, 
where the setting is a hospital. Most hospitals are staffed by people from a 
lot of different countries, a lot of Asians, but you won't see that reflected 
on TV. " 
</P>
<P>
Kunitomi, who works a day job as a tour guide at The Times, is currently 
appearing in "A-Bomb Beauties," a play at the Burbage Theater in West Los 
Angeles that interweaves events from the Hiroshima tragedy. He says he hardly 
ever gets to try out for lead roles in film or television because they're 
rarely written for minorities. To illustrate, he describes the time he 
auditioned for a role in a television show, saw two black actors and a Latino 
actor sitting in the casting office, and said, 'Well, fellas what two lines are 
we reading for?" 
</P>
<P>
Kunitomi did get the part -- a paramedic with four lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems every TV show will do a Chinatown show eventually: the 'A-Team,' 
'T.J. Hooker,' whoever, goes to Chinatown to break up the opium ring or find 
the missing jade doll. So there's a usually a part for a Bad Chinese Overlord; 
there's a Young Kung Fu Artist, there's the Beautiful Young Jade-Like Daughter. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
But these roles, he says, tend to be cameos, stereotypic, and unsubstantive. 
"There are Asian-American dentists, doctors, cops, coaches, teachers," says 
Kunitomi. "We fill every part of society, and yet we are not represented." 
</P>
<P>
Belva Davis, the national equal employment opportunity chair for the 
77,000-member American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, says that 
although the picture is looking better overall, film roles, particularly for 
women of color, are not showing gains. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercials are looking much better, and we've had some cordial talks with the 
networks about increasing minority casting in daytime programming. Prime time 
programming we didn't look at. The 'Cosby Show' alone has changed the 
complexion of prime time." 
</P>
<P>
Her lobbying philosophy stems from showing networks that representing minority 
groups through minority actors makes good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll mention things like blacks watch 55% more daytime programming than 
non-blacks, and point out the disposable income they have; (and by pointing 
this out), we seem to be changing some programming habits." 
</P>
<P>
There just aren't that many important roles in an industry which black actress 
Beverly Todd says, "is not controlled by us." 
</P>
<P>
"I see more and more of us taking control of the product. People like 
(writer-director Spike) Lee and (writer-director Robert) Townsend are an 
example and a trend. So, with or without the support of the powers-that-be, 
they are creating vehicles for us to work in. The new crop will be in better 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
Natsuko Ohama an Asian-American actress who last appeared in the television 
show "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes" should know. For her, the problem has not 
been getting work; "it's the quality of the work," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if I wanted to I could be an extra walking around in the background 
with no lines and work all the time, because, in some way, people are aware 
that Asians are part of our society now -- so we can work in the office in the 
background, shuffling papers, or being in elevators or hospitals. But as far as 
taking a major role in speaking or leading roles it's very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
For Ernest Harada, his major role came 18 years after Broadway first pulled the 
curtain up on "Flower Drum Song." 
</P>
<P>
Although not a box office success, Sondheim's "Pacific Overtures" is today 
considered a landmark piece of musical theater. Opening in Japan in the mid 
1800s, the plot advances to the present and is about the gradual Westernization 
of Japanese society. 
</P>
<P>
The show saw the then unprecedented use of elements of Kabuki theater: the way 
an all-male cast played female and male characters interchangeably. There was 
the sparse, abstract, set, with a floor made of elegant, white maple, and 
scrims, walkways and sliding screens painted Hokusai-style, and Sondheim's 
complex score which attempted to convey the sounds of two cultures and how they 
gradually influenced each other. 
</P>
<P>
In Kabuki tradition, Harada played several roles, including the Madam who has a 
saucy number in which she tries to turn klutzy Japanese farm girls into 
accomplished courtesans for American traders ("Welcome to Kanagawa") -- and a 
Gilbert-and-Sullivanesque British Ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
But, like all shows, "Pacific Overtures" eventually closed, and, as Harada 
says, "That was it. There were no Broadway shows after that -- until this 
year."

GEFFEN WON'T DISTRIBUTE RAP ALBUM 
</P>

<P>
Geffen Records announced Wednesday that it will not distribute the debut album 
by Houston rap group the Geto Boys because of offensive content. 
</P>
<P>
"The extent of which the Geto Boys album glamorizes and possibly endorses 
violence, racism and misogyny compels us to encourage Def American to select a 
distributor with a greater affinity for this musical expression," the Los 
Angeles-based company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The album was scheduled to be released next week by Geffen under a distribution 
agreement with Def American Records, whose roster also includes controversial 
comedian Andrew Dice Clay. The latter's albums were released through Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Geffen statement said Def American is free to find another 
distributor for the Geto Boys album, Def American head Rick Rubin said in a 
separate statement that he has no plans at the moment to look for another 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"I am obviously shocked and disturbed by Geffen's decision," he said. "I am 
very proud of this record and would have liked for people to have had the 
opportunity to hear and judge it for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Among the songs on the album is "Mind of a Lunatic," a detailed, first-person 
account of the handiwork of a sadistic rapist-murderer. 
</P>
<P>
The Geto Boys record had originally been scheduled for release this week, but 
was pushed back after the Digital Audio Disc Corp. pressing plant in Terre 
Haute, Ind., which presses all Geffen releases, had refused to manufacture the 
album. STEVE HOCHMAN

NAT ADDERLEY: THE OTHER BROTHER ARRIVES; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: CORNETIST STEPS OUT OF CANNONBALL'S SHADOW TO MAKE HIS OWN MUSICAL MARK. 
HIS QUINTET VISITS VINE ST. BAR &amp; GRILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nat Adderley is no longer someone else's kid brother. The cornetist came to the 
attention of the jazz world with a quintet led by the dynamic Julian 
(Cannonball) Adderley, and for years he was in the shadow of his gifted and 
eloquent sibling. After Cannonball's death, Nat was adrift for a while, leading 
groups here and there, but today, a persuasive personality in his own right, he 
is heading a quintet that works steadily; he's playing through Saturday at the 
the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, things are looking really good for me right now," he said the other day 
in a call from the Bay Area. "We toured Europe, I spent a couple of days back 
home in Tampa, then it was off to Japan -- about the 10th time I've been there 
-- and directly to Kimball's in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Where Cannonball once stood beside him, Nat now has a promising alto sax 
soloist in Vincent Herring. At the piano is a newcomer to the group, Rob 
Bargad. The other two faces will be familiar to longtime Adderley students: 
Bassist Walter Booker worked for Cannonball from 1968 until the saxophonist's 
death seven years later, and drummer Jimmy Cobb was an Adderley sideman in 
1957-58. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers, fresh out of Florida in 1955, zoomed into prominence via 
records, jazz clubs and concerts. Their partnership was interrupted when 
Cannonball joined Miles Davis for a couple of years, an interim filled by Nat 
with stints playing for J.J. Johnson and later with Woody Herman. Nat 
simultaneously built a secondary career as composer -- his biggest hits were 
"Work Song" and "Jive Samba" -- and occasionally as leader of his own record 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
If he may seem to have been less prominent on the scene recently, the problem 
can be traced to his infrequent visits to the recording studios. "Actually," he 
said, "we made an album that was just issued -- but it was for a Japanese 
label, for release in Japan." He paused, then added, "Well, we are recording 
very shortly for Orrin Keepnew's company, Landmark Records, for American 
release. Orrin made a lot of sessions with Julian and me." 
</P>
<P>
Two missed opportunities for what might have been valuable documents were the 
tours, early last year and again this spring, by a Woody Herman alumni unit, 
with Adderley, Terry Gibbs, Sal Nistico, Nat Pierce and Urbie Green among 
others. "That was quite a band," Adderley recalls, "but they never got around 
to recording." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many jazz eminences who raise second-generation artists in their image, 
Adderley takes pride in a son, Nat Jr., whose success has been enjoyed mainly 
outside the jazz field. 
</P>
<P>
"He did play a few records and gigs with Julian and me, but he really made his 
mark as a pianist and arranger producing for well-known pop people. He's been 
working a lot with Luther Vandross, and he's doing marvelously -- I'm very 
proud of him. It's funny, I thought he didn't want to play jazz, but now it has 
become an avocation; whenever he has the chance he works with the vibes player 
Jay Hoggard." 
</P>
<P>
A short, chubby figure with rare personal charm and the kind of soothing voice 
you would like to hear in your family doctor, Nat Adderley today is admired not 
only for his virtuosity on the horn (he was inspired by Fats Navarro, Dizzy 
Gillespie and Miles Davis), but also for his subtle sense of humor on the 
bandstand. He has reached a plateau of acceptance commensurate with his own 
talent. Still, the memory of his fraternal partnership refuses to fade out. 
</P>
<P>
"We play a lot of that same music, and when we expand our repertoire we tend to 
add one new tune and one old tune. As a matter of fact, it was just 15 years 
ago -- Aug. 8, 1975 -- that we lost Julian. Do I miss him? How can I not?"

VOTE DELAYED ON TRASH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday postponed for 90 days a decision on whether to 
franchise the city's residential garbage collection. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing testimony from nearly two dozen residents, the council chose to 
wait until November to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Terry Belanger said the council will "step back and take 
a little bit of a break, a breather" before deciding whether the city should go 
from its current open market status, in which residents can choose their own 
garbage haulers, to a franchise, in which one or more companies would have 
exclusive hauling rights within the city.

PARKING TIME LIMIT LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shoppers can take their time and not worry about parking tickets since the City 
Council voted Tuesday to remove the two-hour time limit on city lots on the 
north and south sides of the Valley Mall between Granada Avenue, Ramona and 
Valley boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The change was made after a request from the Downtown El Monte Business Assn. 
The two-hour limit will still apply to street parking on Valley Mall Boulevard. 
The ban on parking between 3 and 5 a.m. will continue.

PLANS FOR TRANSIT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New public transportation programs, including one for recreational outings 
outside the city, will be reviewed by the City Council on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The plan discussed Tuesday was for two new programs to be added to the city's 
three existing low-cost transportation programs, the Sierra Madre Augmented and 
Restricted Transportation (SMART), Dial-A-Ride and Foothill Area Community 
Services (FACS). 
</P>
<P>
The services transport residents in the city for 25 cents for a one-way trip. 
Although open to all residents, they are mainly used by senior citizens. About 
$147,000 is allocated for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed programs would cost about $35,000, City Manager James McRea said. 
They would have to be approved by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a sticky wicket on the one hand, and an opportunity on the other," 
Councilwoman Mary Ann MacGillivray said. "We have to develop a less-costly 
system that provides more service and we have to very seriously look at 
duplication of services."

Businesses near the freeway can advertise with taller and larger signs, the

There had been no special allowances for freeway signs. Under the new rules, 
businesses within 500 feet of a freeway can erect signs up to 50 feet tall and 
300 square feet in size. The businesses must be below or at the same level as 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Signs must be more than 100 feet from residential areas.

MALL DEVELOPERS SOUGHT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are seeking developers to renovate a 33-year-old mall into a 
high-volume retail shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency on Monday unanimously approved a request to begin 
soliciting proposals from developers for the Eastland Center shopping mall on 
the San Bernardino Freeway at Barranca Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The agency wants developers to lure customers from throughout the San Gabriel 
Valley with multimedia advertising. Each proposal is expected to include the 
entire 57 acres of Eastland Center. The agency, however, will have the right to 
consolidate, mix or match proposals.

RULES FOR CAMPAIGN SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be fewer legal places to put campaign signs in November, and it will 
cost more to ignore the rules under a new ordinance given preliminary approval 
by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance amends the current sign ordinance, which prohibits posting on any 
public facilities, to include trees and poles within public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for violations has been increased from $5 to $10 for each sign removed 
by the city. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing is scheduled for the Aug. 28 meeting, after which the council 
will make its final decision. If adopted, the ordinance will affect the 
November elections.

UPDATE FOR MUNICIPAL CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday took the first step toward recodifying the aging 
Municipal Code by voting to notify bidders who specialize in updating city 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Recodification is necessary to clarify ambiguities of technical definitions, 
eliminate loopholes and standardize regulations that have been changed over the 
years, Mayor George Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Code was last recodified in the late 1960s, Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James McRea said the cost of updating the Municipal Code could 
approach $10,000.

HOME IMPROVEMENT GRANTS

</HEADLINE>

<P>
The City Council increased limits on residential rehabilitation grants from 
$2,000 to $3,000, with some exceptions to be as high as $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The grants are used to improve single-family homes and mobile homes, often 
owned by elderly, disabled or handicapped residents. The program is funded by 
Community Development Block Grant money. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Harold Johanson noted in a memorandum that neighboring cities 
have higher limits: In Arcadia, the limit is $7,000; in Covina, $6,000, and in 
San Dimas, $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The council authorized the program administrator to grant case-by-case 
extensions of up to $5,000.

2 SENATE CANDIDATES AIM FOR $1-MILLION WAR CHESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite new limits on campaign contributions, state Sen. Ruben S. Ayala 
(D-Chino) and Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) are well on their way toward 
raising $1 million each for their election showdown this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Latest campaign reports, which were due July 31, show that the two men have 
collected nearly $500,000 so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
The election will determine whether Ayala, a former Chino mayor who has been in 
the Senate for 16 years, will retain his seat or be replaced by Bader, a former 
Pomona mayor who is completing his fourth term in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said he expects to net $100,000 from a barbecue fund-raiser at the Guasti 
Mansion in Guasti on Tuesday night that featured Sen. Pete Wilson, the 
Republican gubernatorial nominee. That $100,000 will enlarge a campaign 
treasury already boasting more than $380,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said his campaign is "pretty much on track" toward his goal of raising $1 
million for the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, who raised $263,000 in the first six months of this year, said he also 
expects to run a campaign that will cost $1 million, and he will raise more if 
Bader goes higher. "We're going to match him," Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayala-Bader contest may be the only state legislative election in the San 
Gabriel Valley this fall in which opponents are financially equal. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign statements filed with state and county election officials show a wide 
disparity in nearly every other state legislative race, with incumbents holding 
an overwhelming monetary advantage. The eight legislators who are running for 
reelection in San Gabriel Valley districts had banked a total of more than 
$800,000 for their campaigns by June 30, while their opponents had less than 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the 42nd Assembly District, where South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro, a 
Democrat, is seeking to unseat Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), is 
there anything approaching financial equality. 
</P>
<P>
Mountjoy had more than $52,000 in the bank at the end of June, according to his 
most recent campaign statement, while Fierro had more than $42,000. But much of 
Fierro's money was her own, not raised from supporters. She loaned $31,000 to 
her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), whose district includes part of Pasadena, 
begins his reelection campaign with more than $200,000 in the bank, while his 
Democratic opponent, former Assemblyman Ray Gonzales, starts from scratch after 
spending more than $50,000 to win the primary. 
</P>
<P>
In the 41st Assembly District, incumbent Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) has more than 
$150,000 in the bank, compared to less than $8,500 for Democrat Jeanette Mann 
of Pasadena. Two minor party candidates have indicated they will raise less 
than $1,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents have benefited from large contributions from political action 
committees representing trade groups, corporations, labor unions and other 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
The National Rifle Assn., for example, gave $4,950 each to Nolan and Bader and 
$3,950 to Mountjoy. The California Trial Lawyers Assn. gave $4,500 to Ayala and 
several labor unions gave him more than $3,000 each. Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier) received $5,000 contributions from the California Medical Assn., 
the California Restaurant Assn. and the United Auto Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
Under new campaign financing rules enacted by voters, candidates can receive no 
more than $1,000 each fiscal year from individuals but up to $5,000 a year from 
broad-based political action committees. The financing rules were enacted in 
1988, but this is the first election in which they fully applied. 
</P>
<P>
In three of the San Gabriel Valley's assembly races, no incumbents are running. 
But all three districts have lopsided registrations that appear to give one 
party or the other a strong advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In the heavily Republican 65th Assembly District, now represented by Bader, his 
former aide, Jim Brulte, spent $169,000 to win the Republican primary and 
started the general election campaign with about $12,000 in the bank. His 
Democratic opponent, Bob Erwin, a Chino businessman, had $4,600. 
</P>
<P>
In the 59th Assembly District, which was represented by Calderon until he moved 
up to the Senate earlier this year, the Democratic nominee, Xavier Becerra, 
spent $134,000 to win a wide-open primary race, and he began the fall campaign 
with $6,200 in cash. He will face Republican Leland Lieberg and Libertarian 
Steven Pencall in the November election in a district that is strongly 
Democratic and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar Councilman Paul V. Horcher loaned his own campaign nearly $200,000 
as he narrowly won the Republican primary in the 52nd Assembly District June 5. 
He had $10,000 left for the fall campaign at the end of June, but that was 
still twice as much as Gary Neely, his Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Neely's major financial support has come from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers 
Assn., which gave him $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

AMERICANS, BRITONS TOLD TO ASSEMBLE AT KUWAIT HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 2,500 Americans in Kuwait were given two hours today to move to a hotel to 
protect them against "unspecified threats." A senior U.S. official said the 
Iraqis implied that they would round up Americans who did not cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
The order by Iraqi military authorities was immediately protested by U.S. 
Ambassador Nathaniel Howell as unjustified and impractical, but Americans were 
told of the "request," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi military authorities also instructed all Britons to assemble at a hotel 
in a move that the British Foreign Office condemned as "grave and sinister." 
There are about 3,000 Britons in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis "implied" in the meeting with Howell that military authorities 
"would go out and find" Americans who did not voluntarily go to the 
International Hotel, the senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the situation is of concern to us," Boucher said, but he again 
declined to describe the trapped Americans as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein said today that he was praying for a peaceful 
resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis but that if a military confrontation 
erupts, it could result in "thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement read on Iraqi television -- billed as an open letter to 
President Bush -- Hussein repeatedly accused Bush of being a liar. 
</P>
<P>
"You, President of the United States, have chosen to be a liar," he said. "You 
have lied to your people." 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, in a speech at the Pentagon, Bush had said Hussein was a threat 
to Saudi Arabia -- which he has promised not to attack -- because he lied about 
his intentions regarding Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The International Hotel is opposite the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city. Initially, 
Iraqi authorities told Howell that the Americans should go to central points, 
such as hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"But then it became clear they meant the Kuwaiti International," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not instructing them one way or another," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Howell was summoned about 11 a.m. Kuwait time to a meeting with Iraqi military 
authorities, Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was asked to tell all Americans they had to move to a central point. . . . 
Iraqi authorities asked for compliance within two hours," Boucher said. "They 
explained that the order was a result of concerns about the protection of the 
American community from unspecified threats." 
</P>
<P>
Howell, Boucher said, told the Iraqis that the order was "not only an 
impractical impossibility, but he also asked for an explanation and reminded 
the Iraqi authorities of their responsibility for the safety of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said Howell "made clear that he could inform the Americans of the 
request but that he had no power to order them to move. The Embassy has 
contacted the American community . . . to tell them of this order." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the "action is totally uncalled for." 
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans would be better off in their homes," he said.

45,000 MARINES READIED FOR GULF, U.S. SOURCES SAY

Pentagon sources today disclosed plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the inflamed 
Persian Gulf region to supplement the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force 
troops already committed. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the Marine deployment became known as one source said the President 
had given naval commanders in the Persian Gulf permission to use "minimum 
force" to halt shipments to and from Iraq in enforcement of a U.N.-backed trade 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said today that Iraq has continued to 
increase its armed forces in Kuwait and that intelligence reports estimate 
their number at 160,000. He said there has been no major change in the 
character of the forces, which the Pentagon earlier described as having a 
defensive appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the Marine deployment was disclosed by officials speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said the service 
has sent a "substantial armada" of assault troops -- the largest since the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just arrive," the four-star general said in an interview. "We're 
there to stay for a fairly lengthy period."

KING HUSSEIN MEETS BUSH; NO PROGRESS

<P>
President Bush pressed King Hussein today to close Iraq's access to the sea 
through Jordan, but Hussein indicated that Bush made little headway with him. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein had been widely reported to be carrying a message from Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. But he said after the meeting that he had brought no such 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not bring any message. I am not talking on behalf of anyone in the 
area," the king told reporters outside Bush's seaside vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had been expected to try to persuade Hussein to respect a U.N. embargo and 
cut off Iraqi shipments moving through the Jordanian port of Aqaba. But Hussein 
said after their two-hour meeting, "I am not suggesting that we have altered 
our position at all in this regard." 
</P>
<P>
He said his government supports the U.N. sanctions but is seeking clarification 
on "exactly what the sanctions mean," particularly with regard to foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush suggested Tuesday that Aqaba be shut down if Hussein continues to allow 
Iraqi supplies to move through it. But Hussein said today the port, "our only 
outlet to the sea," is vital to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The king, who has been seeking to mediate the dispute between his allies in 
Baghdad and Washington, expressed the hope that the crisis will ease. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried my utmost to see what could be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Bush were useful because they gave him a chance to hear 
Bush's views. But he gave no indication of any progress on a diplomatic 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feels such a solution is possible, the king replied: "I suppose one 
has to have hope. Without hope you can't get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was escorted to his helicopter from Bush's summer home by 
somber-looking U.S. officials, including Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Neither Baker nor Scowcroft 
commented to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who had given his longtime friend a helicopter tour of Washington during 
a friendly meeting last year, remained inside his home. 
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Hussein, Bush also met with Saudi Arabia's foreign 
minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, and the Saudi ambassador to the United States, 
Prince Bander ibn Sultan. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was accompanied on his trip here by Baker, who hitched a ride on the 
monarch's jetliner. At the helipad on the President's compound, Bush and his 
wife Barbara greeted the king warmly when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Your majesty, welcome," Bush said. "I think you know Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is irritated at the king because of his defense of Saddam 
Hussein and refusal to abide by U.N. sanctions. On the other hand, officials 
say they recognize that King Hussein is in a tough spot, with a powerful and 
aggressive Iraq as his neighbor and a large Palestinian population in his 
country sympathetic to Saddam Hussein.

<P>
A police officer was found dead in his home, apparently the result of a 
suicide, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Officer Sean Leahy, 29, was discovered Wednesday morning by fellow 
Rampart Division officers who went to his Rowena Avenue home to check up on him 
after he failed to report to work for two days. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy apparently died of a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, 
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said. An autopsy was pending. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy was last seen alive at 4:15 p.m Saturday when he left the Rampart station 
after his shift, Dambacher said. After he failed to report for work for two 
scheduled shifts, patrol officers were sent to his home to make a check.

A pro-Iranian leader said today that the deployment of U.S. troops in the 
Persian Gulf will delay the release of American hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see . . . that the American hostages will be released soon because 
America is in a state of clear aggression against the Islamic nation," Hussein 
Moussawi, a senior member of Hezbollah (Party of God), said. 
</P>
<P>
"Releasing the American hostages now would be a reward to the Americans for 
their invasion of the gulf," Moussawi said. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the other European hostages, be they Britons or others, their situation 
is different than that of the Americans," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A Beirut newspaper reported today that all Western hostages in Lebanon could be 
free by the end of the year. The leftist As-Safir newspaper said secret 
contacts are taking place between Tehran and Lebanese and Palestinian groups 
with links to the hostage-takers.

Joint U.S.-Vietnamese teams searching for American soldiers killed during the 
Southeast Asia conflict have found 20 sets of American remains in central 
Vietnam, the Hanoi government said today. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said experts had found 70 sets of human remains 
since they began their latest search earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty sets have been tested and confirmed as American. The 50 others have not 
yet been tested, she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. experts arrived in Hanoi on Aug. 6 for the 11th joint search since 
Hanoi and Washington began official cooperation in 1987 on American servicemen 
missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 240 sets of remains have been repatriated since 1987, of which 100 
have been positively identified.

119 METROPOLITAN AREAS FAIL U.S. AIR STANDARDS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: LOS ANGELES REMAINS ON EPA'S LIST AS OVERALL NATIONAL MONITORING 
FINDS SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT.

<P>
Government monitoring of air quality showed only slight improvement over the 
last year, with 119 metropolitan areas including Los Angeles still failing 
pollution standards, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA released lists of cities that violated ozone or smog limits -- a 
summertime problem -- and those that failed carbon monoxide standards that are 
most difficult to meet in colder months. 
</P>
<P>
"These lists demonstrate the magnitude of the air pollution problem still 
remaining in this country," said EPA Deputy Administrator F. Henry Habicht. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some improvements, Habicht said, 133 million people still live in areas 
exceeding the smog standard and almost 78 million in areas that are over the 
carbon monoxide limit. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six areas failed smog tests and 41 flunked in carbon monoxide 
monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Most major cities in this country are still not meeting at least one of these 
standards," said Warren Freas, spokesman for the EPA's air quality office. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen major cities had violations of both standards, down from 21 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The total failing at least one of the standards last year was 124. The new 
lists cover actual monitoring of air quality in major urban areas for 1987 
through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The lists are used by the EPA to determine whether state clean air plans can be 
approved. The EPA said it would use the lists to determine any new requirements 
that cities must meet under the Clean Air Act being worked out by a 
House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that appear on the lists can be required to increase auto emissions 
inspections, require cleaner fuel and take other steps to cut down on 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities still on one or both of the lists showed some improvement over last 
year because of anti-pollution measures, particularly Denver, which has 
required gasoline stations to sell oxygenated fuel which burns cleaner, Freas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Denver went from 29 days of violations four years ago to three during the last 
winter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smog, caused by the interaction of sunlight and chemicals emitted from 
automobiles and a variety of sources, can cause eye irritations and respiratory 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide, primarily from motor vehicles, can affect the heart and brain 
by reducing the amount of oxygen that gets to human tissues. 
</P>
<P>
The allowable content in the air is different for each pollutant: 0.12 parts 
per million for smog and 9 parts per million for carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 areas on both lists included the nation's largest cities. More than one 
third are in California. In addition to Los Angeles, they are San 
Francisco-Oakland, Fresno, Modesto, Sacramento, San Diego and Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
The others are New York, Boston, Hartford, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, 
Greensboro-Winston Salem, N.C., Memphis, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., Cleveland and El 
Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Eight areas were dropped from the smog list from last year: Columbia, S.C.; 
Jacksonville, Fla.; Lafayette, Ind.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Huntsville, Ala.; 
Anderson, S.C.; Tulsa, Okla., and Portland, Ore. Three were added: Smyth 
County, Va.; the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol area in Tennessee and Virginia, 
and Evansville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Seven areas are newly meeting carbon monoxide standards: Manchester, N.H.; 
Oklahoma City; St. Louis; Great Falls, Mont.; Greeley, Colo.; Salt Lake City, 
and Yakima, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
New to the list of violators are Syracuse, N.Y.; Philadelphia; Duluth, Minn., 
and Stockton, Calif.

Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. said it will lay off 800 workers in its Puerto Rican 
cannery, in part because of the rising costs of producing dolphin-safe tuna. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will cease production during the second shift at its 
facility in Mayaguez, the world's largest albacore cannery. 
</P>
<P>
The plant will continue operation with its 1,000 remaining workers. Department 
of Labor officials will assist laid-off workers, and a job center is being 
established to provide employment counseling at the site, Bumble Bee 
representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee, the third-largest U.S. tuna canner, announced with other major 
canners in April that it was phasing out tuna caught using fishing techniques 
that also catch dolphins.

Tariffs will be reduced on 1,900 goods in a market-widening move designed to 
support Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 
Finance Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
A ministry section chief said the government is drafting a list of about 1,900 
imported products, including passenger cars, automobile components, farm goods 
and precision instruments, that could have their import tariffs cut early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of our tariff cut is to encourage imports and liberalize our 
market," the official said in a telephone interview. "It is also in line with 
our plans to join GATT." 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had a trade surplus of $12 billion with the United States in 1989, 
although the figure is expected to drop below $10 billion this year, Taiwan 
trade officials said.

Average earnings of British workers rose 10% in the year ending in June despite 
government appeals to employers to hold down wage costs to fight high 
inflation, official figures showed today. 
</P>
<P>
In another blow to the Conservative government, which is trailing the 
opposition Labor Party in opinion polls, unemployment increased by a seasonally 
adjusted 10,900 in July to 1.63 million or 5.7% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive month for lengthened unemployment lines in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Both earnings, up from 9.75% in May, and the increase in unemployment were 
above market expectations.

It's the 20th anniversary of personalized license plates in California, so 
car-care company Eagle One held a contest to find the most creative plate on 
the road. The winner, chosen by a panel of TV comedy writers, was motion 
picture production manager Robert P. Schneider, whose plate, IM2BZ2P, refers to 
the 16-hour days he says he works. 
</P>
<P>
The runners-up -- culled from 600 entries from 36 states -- were OUT50GZ (Out 
50 G's), a reference to the cost of Linda Ressler's Mercedes in Valencia; 
O4A4RE (Oh for a Ferrari) on Lou Mickley's Honda in Bethlehem, Pa.; AUDIDOD 
(Audi Doody) on Joyce Matuszak's Audi in Sandwich, Ill., and BRTQLIT (Be 
Articulate) on speech therapist Rita Larson's car in Burlingame, Calif. 
</P>

Schneider won a CD player for his car and $500 in car-care products. Replicas 
of the plates will go on display at the Improv comedy nightclub in Hollywood.

TUPPERWARE FLIPS LID OVER NEWS LEAK ON SECRET PRODUCT

The lid has popped off Tupperware's secret new product for 1990, and the 
plastic kitchenware giant is steamed. 
</P>
<P>
The Peoria Journal Star reported Wednesday that Tupperware's "revolutionary new 
product line" is a group of stackable microwave dishes that can be used 
simultaneously in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper really did a number on us," said Alan Luce, Tupperware vice 
president for administration. "This was a major product breakthrough for us. It 
was not like a new tumbler or color. This was a major secret." 
</P>
<P>
The new line was to have been unveiled nationally Aug. 27. But the newspaper on 
Tuesday got a reporter inside a closed session of a Tupperware convention when 
the product was introduced to a jubilant crowd of dealers and sales managers. 
</P>
<P>
Luce said the story "ruined the fun, surprise and excitement" for 
conventioneers attending sessions later this week in Peoria, Orlando, Fla., and 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 110,000 independent Tupperware dealers in the United States. We 
prefer that they know about our new products before the general public knows," 
said Lawrie Pitcher Platt, spokeswoman at Tupperware headquarters in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Peoria Mayor Jim Maloof said his secretary received several calls from upset 
Tupperware officials. He said he called the newspaper to ask if the story could 
be pulled from its evening editions. The paper refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand what's the big deal. They had news, and we went and got 
it," said Jack Brimeyer, assistant managing editor. "We didn't treat them any 
differently than any other business or news story." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said he had heard Tupperware had threatened to cancel its 
three-year contract to hold conventions in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
The new line is called Tupperwave. It's a nine-piece selection of 
casserole-type dishes and accessories that can be stacked three-high in a 
microwave to allow for the simultaneous cooking of entrees, side dishes and 
desserts. 
</P>
<P>
In unveiling the product Tuesday to Tupperware representatives from 17 Midwest 
states, Vice President Larry Camberon said: "There's not a company in the world 
that has stack cooking in a microwave. Those people at Rubber Maid don't know 
anything about it."

The Grateful Dead, searching for a replacement after keyboardist Brent 
Mydland's fatal drug overdose, has turned to an old and well-known friend: 
singer-songwriter Bruce Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
Hornsby, in a statement released today through his record company, confirmed he 
will be sitting in on keyboards for selected Dead dates in the near future, 
including the band's run at Madison Square Garden, Sept. 15-20. 
</P>
<P>
Hornsby "has responded affirmatively to a request from his longtime friends to 
help them through this difficult period," the statement from RCA Records said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dead has toured in the past with Hornsby, and guitarist Jerry Garcia played 
on Hornsby's latest single, "Across the River." Hornsby's current album, "A 
Night on the Town," with his band, The Range, has gone gold. 
</P>
<P>
Mydland was found dead of a drug overdose in his California home on July 26.

LIZ SMITH: TRUMP SAYS HE'S HUMBLE AND THAT THE PRESS LIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LIZ SMITH

<TEXT>

"I THINK that I'm a rather -- and you will be surprised -- but I can be a 
rather humble person, if I want to be, if I feel I'm in the right environment. 
You're always guarded. I'm not going to let my guard down because you happen to 
be asking me questions. You're somebody I know and have a great respect for, 
but I'm not going to let my guard down because Barbara's here, asking me 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
This is Donald Trump speaking to Barbara Walters in the interview she will air 
this Friday over ABC's "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
I ASKED Barbara to describe the atmosphere of her meeting with the tycoon in 
his offices in the Trump Tower. Once upon a time, Donald and Barbara seemed to 
be friends, but it's no secret around New York that he has blasted her as 
"being on Ivana's side." Still, Trump has a new book to promote -- "Surviving 
At The Top" -- and I guess he felt he'd get a fair shake from Walters. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling in his office may have changed somewhat, but not the decor. The 
walls are lined with framed national and international magazines that made 
Trump their cover boy in the past. But there isn't a single Trump cover since 
the decline, though he has been on many magazines. Barbara notes that what 
Donald has in real abundance is stunning secretaries and receptionists -- "each 
one better looking than the one before." 
</P>
<P>
And he is faithfully attended by his loyal assistant, Norma Ferderer, who just 
happens to be one of the nicest, fairest-minded and most sensible persons ever 
to sit in the eye of a storm. 
</P>
<P>
TRUMP BLAMES the press, with whom he is simply furious, and he blames the 
general economic turn-down for all his troubles. The most interesting thing he 
says in the interview is that the U.S. is not in a recession, but IN A 
DEPRESSION! So, he says he "has to roll with the punches." But Trump insists he 
has made "great deals" with the banks and will ultimately be victorious. 
</P>
<P>
On the matter of the press, Trump says: "I hope the general public understands 
how inherently dishonest the press in this country is . . . what the press has 
done is taken a situation where they see something and blown it to kingdom 
come. . . . I have never seen press reporting as I have with regard to me." 
</P>
<P>
DONALD SAYS that his wife, Ivana, is a good mother and he refuses "to disparage 
her." But he doesn't respond, or deny, when Walters questions him about his 
relationship with his 12-year-old son, Donnie. (Barbara notes he and the boy 
have not talked since last May.) Donald defends the pre-nuptial agreement he 
and Ivana signed and characterizes her actions like this: "Ivana decided to sue 
me on it, brilliantly decided to sue me on it." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "She's not going to win the suit."

Quarterback Pat Ryan, released by the New York Jets after 12 years with the 
team, is expected to sign today with the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 34, worked out with the Browns on Wednesday and will sign a two-year deal 
if he passes a physical exam today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the results of the physical," Browns' spokesman Bob Eller 
said. "It's likely we will sign him." 
</P>
<P>
With the Jets, Ryan played mostly as a reserve, most recently behind Ken 
O'Brien. He was released in the off-season after the Jets signed Tony Eason.

Amid NFL lobbying to include more minorities in Super Bowl-related events, 
marching bands from two predominantly black colleges have been invited to be in 
this city's annual Gasparilla parade. 
</P>
<P>
Band directors from both Florida A&amp;M and Bethune Cookman said plans weren't 
final but they were excited about the possibility of playing for a national 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much interested," said Harold Bray, director of the Bethune 
Cookman marching band. 
</P>
<P>
If the two groups reach an agreement with the task force, it might be the first 
time any predominantly black group will march in the traditional parade, which 
was rescheduled for the day before Super Bowl XXV in January.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL HAS CASH ON ITS MIND IN CONFERENCE SHUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
College sports have been thrown to the wolves in the suits. The coaches and 
players can take the next few years off. They're strictly small print. No one 
in the know cares about touchdowns, turnovers or three-point shots. Realignment 
is the game right now. The big-money game. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers and accountants and demographics whizzes have moved in. They're the 
ones in charge. No questions asked. It's a negotiating free-for-all. Anyone can 
talk to anyone else. All rules are off. All traditions are old news, not worth 
a nickel. We're talking about a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Who is No. 1? The team with the best defense? Nope. The conference that cuts 
the best deal. The conference that gets the largest share of the television 
market. That's what college sports are all about now -- television shares. 
</P>
<P>
The games may look the same, but they will never be the same. Decades-old 
conference ties are being snipped, new ones sewed. Some conferences may die, 
others merge. There will be a championship football playoff one of these years 
-- that looks certain now, at least from this seat. Bowls won't be the end-all 
anymore. As always, some little people probably will pay. 
</P>
<P>
Is it a shame? Sure it is. Change isn't necessarily bad, and there's nothing 
wrong with trying to make money, but these people are tromping all over the 
history and many of the traditions of their sports. You say nothing is like it 
used to be? Well, college sports -- particularly football -- may soon be 
Exhibit A. 
</P>
<P>
It all started after last season, when Penn State jumped to the Big Ten and 
Notre Dame signed its own football TV contract. It was clear, despite the 
conference's altruistic posturing, that the Big Ten was trying to make itself 
more attractive to the networks. It was also suddenly clear that networks were 
only going to be signing football deals with individual conferences and 
schools. It's called a free market. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, conferences are considering annexing schools that would make them 
more attractive to the networks, and schools are mulling the positives and 
negatives of jumping to different conferences. 
</P>
<P>
What should we make of it? The smart money says that four or five football 
super-conferences are going to emerge from this mishmash in the coming years, 
that they will annex enough big names to push many of the other conferences out 
of business. The top candidates are the Big Ten, Pac-10, SEC and ACC, all of 
which appear to be gaining weight instead of -- like the Southwest -- losing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
If you're going to try to follow it all, don't think logically. Regionalism, 
long the backbone of college sports, doesn't matter much anymore. The Big Ten 
proved that by taking Penn State, which is about 1,000 miles from some of its 
new "brothers." And Texas going to the Pac-10? Last time I checked, Texas was a 
long, long way from the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But, see, annexing Texas makes sense for the Pac-10 in this new order, because 
it would boost the conference's share of the national television market from 
14% to more than 20%. The conference would be in a better position to negotiate 
a football deal with one of the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all this probably will mean the end of some smaller sports, which 
will be even less cost-efficient in conferences covering so much territory. 
Let's talk about that dual track meet between Penn State and Minnesota. How 
long do you think the schools would be willing to take a loss on that? 
</P>
<P>
Not all the changes will be bad. The emergence of super-conferences will mean 
more quality games during the football regular season. As things stand now, 
everyone except Notre Dame tries to schedule as many sure wins as possible. 
It's largely a bore. 
</P>
<P>
But the devaluation of the football bowls will be sad. The question of who is 
No. 1 sustains furious debate and a healthy dose of anarchy; it is one of the 
last gray areas left in sports, and replacing it with a sterile, 
made-for-television tournament will contribute to deadening the game, not 
enlivening it.

FILM HISTORY: THE AUTHOR FOUNDED THE OZ FILM MANUFACTURING CO. THIS FILM 
FLIRTATION IS THE SUBJECT OF AN EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Once upon a time, Gower Street in Hollywood was also known as Gower Gulch, 
because of all the quickie Westerns being made at the small and struggling 
studios along it. It was also known as Poverty Row because so many of the 
studios' struggles were unavailing. Only Columbia ultimately prospered on 
Gower. 
</P>
<P>
The Gower Gulch days were early Hollywood, before production had begun to be 
dominated by a handful of majors, and there seemed to be new studios on every 
block. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, for a moment and half from 1914 to 1915, was the Oz Film 
Manufacturing Co., founded by L. Frank Baum, who had just published the eighth 
of his Oz books, "Tik-Tok of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
The film company adventure, and Baum's whole, quite remarkable life, are on 
view in an ambitious and inventive display at the Frances Goldwyn branch of the 
Los Angeles Public Library on Ivar in Hollywood. I caught up with it belatedly, 
I confess in some chagrin, but it runs through Aug. 31 and is engrossing. It 
includes a video display of Oz on film, television and stage, with rare clips 
from some of the five films the Oz studio made in its short, troubled life. 
</P>
<P>
Baum, who had moved to Los Angeles from Chicago with his wife Maud and his 
children in 1910, had had a life strewn with ill health and financial troubles. 
He'd had to sign over to his creditors the rights to the first Oz book, "The 
Wonderful Wizard of Oz," even though it had already sold 780,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
He built a house, Ozcot, at Cherokee and Yucca, and he raised capital to launch 
the studio by tapping his new pals in the Los Angeles Athletic Club and the 
Uplifters, a kind of boys' night out club in Rustic Canyon famed for its lively 
revues, which Baum wrote and performed in. 
</P>
<P>
Baum produced "The Patchwork Girl of Oz," "The Magic Cloak of Oz," and "The New 
Wizard of Oz" and two non-Oz films. On the evidence of the clips on view at the 
library, the Oz works were full of trick photography and slapstick. They were 
silent, of course, although there were scores written for in-theater use by 
Baum's compatriot from the Uplifters, Louis Gottschalk. 
</P>
<P>
There were distribution problems (then as now) and a harassing suit by the 
Edison interests, trying to assert its monopoly over the motion picture camera. 
Baum himself fell seriously ill again and after a brief cessation in 1914 the 
Oz studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard, shut down for good in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
The Oz books have had tremendous appeal and staying power since Baum published 
the first one in 1900. He wrote 14 before he died; Ruth Plumly Thompson wrote 
many more before she wearied, and only recently a new Oz appeared, written by a 
Baum grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Baum seems as prototypical an American story as, say, Mark Twain. He led a 
peripatetic life as a writer of all trades who tried his hand at everything 
from raising purebred chickens to running a dry goods store to editing 
newspapers in South Dakota and conducting a satirical column. He wrote in many 
forms, from songs and plays to retellings of Mother Goose, and he used several 
pseudonyms before, at his family's urging, he turned his spur-of-the-moment 
bedtime stories into that first Oz book. 
</P>
<P>
Like Howard Garis, who wrote the first titles in the Tom Swift series, Baum was 
from Upstate New York (Chittenango in Baum's case) and was nuts about all the 
emerging technologies of the 20th Century. There are glimmerings of science 
fiction as well as sheer fantasy in the Oz books. Partly for this reason, and 
for his slyboots commentaries on the real world, he has been read not only by 
children but by all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Like other authors, Baum at one point felt himself a captive of his creations 
and tried to stop the series, reporting that it was no longer visible and 
reachable. There were such outcries that he relented and decided it could be 
reached by the relatively newfangled wireless telegraph, and the next book was 
in essence a report from Oz. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Garland and a song may have given Baum and Oz their widest fame, but you 
have to hope that new generations of readers are continuing to discover the 
books themselves, because they represent a unique and many-faceted body of 
work. Baum's mother-in-law was a famous and ardent suffragette, for example, 
and militant feminists, led by General Jinjur and armed only with knitting 
needles, have their day in one of the early Oz books, "The Land of Oz." Oz has 
been ruled by men long enough, the general says. The women are temporarily, but 
only temporarily, routed by mice. 
</P>
<P>
Baum with all else was a prophet, possibly with tongue in cheek, a sly satirist 
with all his other endearing charms. 
</P>
<P>

TONY BENNETT: ONCE MORE WITH FEELING; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: RETURNING TO HIS HOMETOWN GAVE THE SINGER A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR ALBUM

Tony Bennett may have left his heart in San Francisco, but it was in his old 
neighborhood that he found it. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the celebrated pop singer, who between 1950 and 1965 scored no 
fewer than 24 Top 40 hits on the national charts, returned to Astoria -- a 
working-class section of Queens, N.Y. -- to record his 93rd album, "Astoria: 
Portrait of the Artist." 
</P>
<P>
Bennet says it is perhaps the most heartfelt album he's ever done. He didn't 
just interpret songs. Finding himself back where he was born, he was inspired 
to interpret his own life, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my son's idea," said Bennett, who will perform Friday night at 
Humphrey's on Shelter Island. "He said, let's do an album where you go back 
home. For years, people have been saying, why don't you write an autobiography, 
and I would always say no, I'm not ready. 
</P>
<P>
"But then this idea was placed in me, and I figured, as long as I'm an 
interpreter of popular American songs, why not find songs that fit the mood, 
the feeling I got from returning home, and create something a little more vital 
than an ordinary autobiography -- a group of song sketches about the different 
things that happen, and the feelings you get, as you're growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"What was going through my mind was this wonderful recall of good feelings -- 
of the first time I fell in love, of the great meals my mom cooked for me, of 
the friends I had on street corners and how we used to sit around on summer 
nights, get big quarts of beer and sing tunes together." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, "Astoria" is very much a musical autobiography, divided into 14 
"chapters." The first, "When Do the Bells Ring for Me," is a song "that reminds 
me of the many hours I spent as a boy, walking on the banks of the East River 
while admiring the spectacular view of the most powerful city in the world," 
according to Bennett's self-penned liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent chapters include "I Was Lost, I Was Drifting," about Bennett's 
post-World War II soul-searching; "The Folks That Live on the Hill," about the 
American dream he harbored and eventually realized, and "'Where Did the Magic 
Go," something of a Requiem for the pre-rock 'n' roll "golden age of popular 
music in America" in which he became a star. 
</P>
<P>
The album closes with "I've Come Home Again," which Bennett describes as "a 
fitting ending that really hits the bull's-eye." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing just flowed out of me, whereas, say, five years ago, I 
wouldn't have been ready yet," Bennett said. "But for some reason, going on 64, 
I was finally able to reflect, to put my life in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of deja vu that pervades "Astoria" isn't limited to the music. The 
album's front cover shows Bennett standing in his neighborhood at the age of 
15; the back cover has him in the same spot last year, at age 63. "Everything 
is still very much as I remember it," Bennett said. "Even though Astoria is 
only 15 minutes from downtown New York, it's a lot like a small Midwestern 
town. It's real family-oriented, blue-collar-oriented, made up of people who 
make the town work: secretaries and teachers and bus drivers and cab drivers 
and people who actually build the buildings; nice neighbors who say hello to 
you on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"And it felt so good, after 40 years of traveling all over the world, to go 
back and still find the same type of people, to still hear the same accents, 
the same colloquialisms." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was born Anthony Dominick Benedetto, the son of a grocer father and 
seamstress mother. He began singing in church at the age of 7; in his teens, he 
worked as a singing waiter at a neighborhood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
After serving as an infantryman in the Army during World War II, Bennett 
returned to Astoria and resumed his singing career in local nightclubs. He also 
made several appearances on "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts" radio show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, Bennett successfully auditioned for a part in Pearl Bailey's musical 
revue at the Old Greenwich Village Inn, and soon got his big break. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Hope came down to see me and asked me to come up and sing with him at the 
Paramount Theater," Bennett recalled. "He didn't like my stage name, Joe Bari, 
so he said, 'What's your real name?' 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, and he said, 'That's too long for the marquee -- let's Americanize 
it into Tony Bennett.' " 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Bennett, with Hope's blessing, auditioned for Mitch Miller of 
Columbia Records with a demo recording of "Boulevard of Broken Dreams," a song 
revived from the 1934 film "Moulin Rouge." 
</P>
<P>
He promptly got signed, and although his Columbia debut, a remake of 
"Boulevard," barely cracked the charts, his second single, "Because of You," 
was on the charts for 31 weeks, peaking at No. 1 in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Over the ensuing decade and a half, Bennett continued to crank out hit after 
hit, including "Just in Time," "Cold, Cold Heart," "Stranger in Paradise," 
"Rags to Riches" and, in 1962, "I Left My Heart in San Francisco," his 
signature song. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't even the A side, it was the B side" of the record, Bennett recalled. 
"I thought it would just be a local hit in the San Francisco area, knowing how 
much people there loved their city, but it really turned around, breaking open 
all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Bennett scored his last Top 40 hit with "If I Ruled the 
World," from the musical "Pickwick." In 1971, he was unceremoniously dumped by 
Columbia, only to be re-signed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he had recorded two critically acclaimed albums with jazz 
pianist Bill Evans, on the independent Fantasy and Improv labels, and launched 
a side career as a painter, attaching his "Anthony Benedetto" signature to 
oils, watercolors and pastels seen at exhibitions throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Since his 1986 re-emergence on Columbia, Bennett has recorded three albums: 
"The Art of Excellence," "Bennett/Berlin" and, most recently, "Astoria: 
Portrait of the Artist." 
</P>
<P>
He's so pleased with the latter that he plans to take the autobiographical 
approach a step further with his next release. Album No. 94, scheduled to come 
out next March, will be a 40-year retrospective of Bennett's illustrious 
singing career. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, even though I interpreted those songs, most of them are 
autobiographic, too," Bennett said. "My entire career, I only sang songs I 
felt, songs I felt I lived at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"And even though they're just songs, there are these feelings that we all feel, 
all of us, that are in these songs, and they kind of tell my life."

STAYING TRUE TO EARTHY COUNTRY ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: EMMYLOU HARRIS HAS DONE A LOT TO WIDEN THE APPEAL OF COUNTRY MUSIC, 
WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE INTEGRITY OF ITS SOUND.

<P>
Emmylou Harris is as responsible as anyone for broadening country music's 
once-limited appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In a recording career that spans nearly two decades, she has consistently 
crossed over to mainstream pop audiences -- but not with diluted, homogenized 
pablum. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has steadfastly remained true to the spirit of traditional country and 
its gritty, earthy roots. She has freshened it up, livened it up, but never 
compromised its inherent integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think as soon as you start trying to cross over, you're dead," said Harris, 
who will appear Sunday night at Humphrey's on Shelter Island. "Pop music is 
popular music, and all kinds of music can be popular. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the music that has the most staying power is unusual and different, 
not homogenous, so I've never been interested in crossing over. I think the way 
you cross over is to find your albums in the living rooms of people who also 
listen to all kinds of other, different music." 
</P>
<P>
Harris' philosophy about country music stems from her apprenticeship with the 
late Gram Parsons, the founding father of country-rock. Parsons came up with 
the amalgam in 1966, with the International Submarine Band, and later refined 
it with the Byrds (on 1968's "Sweetheart of the Rodeo" album) and the Flying 
Burrito Brothers. The two met, by chance, in 1970, in Washington. Harris, a 
native of Birmingham, Ala., had just moved south from New York, a refugee of 
the waning Greenwich Village folk scene. Parsons was in the midst of his final 
tour with the Flying Burrito Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing a little folk club, and the Flying Burrito Brothers were playing 
down the street," Harris recalled. "They came in after their show, and the next 
night, when they were in Baltimore, Gram came in again. He was talking about 
doing a solo album, and he told me he wanted a girl singer. 
</P>
<P>
"So, between sets, we just sat backstage in this little basement club, sitting 
on kegs of beer, singing some songs, and he told me he wanted me on his album. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought nothing of it -- people are always promising you things, and I was 
thinking, 'you'll call me, right.' But he kept in touch, and finally, I got a 
ticket to come to L.A. and work on his album. 
</P>
<P>
"And that started my apprenticeship in the world of Gram Parsons and his 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival, Harris said, Parsons played her a bunch of old country songs, 
just to show her where his heart was at. 
</P>
<P>
"I just became a complete convert," she recalled. "I felt I had struck a mother 
lode, this incredible vein of gold that never ended. I remember thinking to 
myself, how come I never heard these people before? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain what the sound was like, the harmonies and the songs -- and 
then to discover there was more music like this. And, once I started listening 
to those songs and learning those songs, that was the way I looked at music -- 
through the eyes of a harmony singer." 
</P>
<P>
Harris continued to record and tour with Parsons until his untimely death, of a 
booze- and drug-induced heart attack, in 1973. A few months later, intent on 
keeping alive his legacy, she formed her own band and eventually landed a 
recording deal with Warner Brothers Records. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Harris has interpreted myriad traditional country tunes on her 
records, including "When They Ring Those Golden Bells," "Tennessee Waltz" and 
Hank Snow's "I'm Movin' On." 
</P>
<P>
She's also written originals in the same style, with the same spirit, and 
covered an eclectic array of pop songs -- from the Beatles' "Here, There, and 
Everywhere" to Donna Summer's "On the Radio" -- that she's turned into instant 
country classics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mainly the lyrics; there has to be something in the lyrics to make me 
want to sing a song," Harris said. "I don't worry if it's country or not, I 
just figure out a way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Harris' latest album, "Duets," is, as its name suggests, a collection of duets 
she has recorded over the years. Among them are "Love Hurts," with Parsons; 
"All Fall Down," with George Jones; "Star of Bethlehem," with Neil Young; and 
"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again," with the late Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at Warner Brothers had been talking to me for years about how many 
duets I'd done, and why don't we do a compilation," Harris said. "So, finally I 
said, sure, and we took 10 old sides, and then I wanted to put some new things 
on it as well." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, one of those "new things," "The Price I Pay," is a duet 
with the Desert Rose Band, fronted by Chris Hillman, the ex-Byrd who brought 
Gram Parsons into the band and then left with him to form the Flying Burrito 
Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to do something with him," Harris said, "ever since Gram 
introduced us."

ARCHBOLD MAKES MOVE TO AVOID REAL WIPEOUT; 
</P>
<P>
SURFING: SAN CLEMENTE STANDOUT TURNS AWAY FROM A LIFE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, Matt Archbold's lifestyle was as radical and unpredictable 
as the waves he surfed each day. 
</P>
<P>
Speeding through life's fast lane, Archbold landed this spring in a San 
Clemente jail and later in a rehabilitation clinic to fight a drug and alcohol 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21, Archbold's surfing career appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
Not five months later, his recovery appears to be on track. He edged friend and 
fellow San Clemente surfer Dino Andino to win the Laguna Sportswear pro-am 
competition Sunday at Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
And he's back in the waves this week as the Professional Surfing Assn. of 
America tour stops in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everything is going right for me," Archbold said after earning 
$7,400 for his victory at Salt Creek. "I want to keep it up and not let myself 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Letdowns. Archbold knows all about them. He just wasn't ready to deal with them 
-- until a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Archbold won his only PSAA event in 1988, at Oceanside, when he was hung over 
from a long night of partying. Last summer at Salt Creek, his last pro surfing 
event that year, Archbold made the quarterfinals but partied all night and 
never made it to the final day of the competition. He was appropriately 
nicknamed "the Wildman" on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny now," Archbold said. "Then, it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Archbold, who dropped out of school in the ninth grade, turned 
professional and set out on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour. 
</P>
<P>
After he had been on the tour for two years, Archbold was earning $4,500 a 
month. But he also was burning himself out. He relied more and more on drugs 
and alcohol as an outlet. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until April, when Archbold was arrested for driving under the 
influence, that he realized his life was being wiped out. Suddenly, it wasn't 
such a joyride anymore. 
</P>
<P>
While sitting in jail for two weeks, Archbold had plenty of time to think. 
</P>
<P>
He thought about his family, the friends he lost and the surfing contests he 
was too hung over to compete in. He thought about his dependency on alcohol and 
cocaine, and how it cost him his major sponsorship on the pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a long look at myself and decided I didn't like myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So Archbold checked into the Betty Ford Clinic. He learned to deal with his 
problems and his dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Archbold left the clinic early in the summer and rejoined the PSAA tour. He 
finished seventh in his first event back, at Oceanside in June. 
</P>
<P>
He reached the finals at San Clemente, where he placed fourth. Then came the 
victory at Salt Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Andino, who has known Archbold for 15 years, said his friend has turned his 
life around. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stoked for him," Andino said. "He's different now in every way, mentally, 
physically. He was more to himself before. We drifted apart as friends. But now 
he's much more open with everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Archbold attends night school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He hangs out 
with a new group of friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful that I pulled through everything," Archbold said. "My family and 
my girlfriend have been behind me." 
</P>
<P>
With his problems under control, Archbold has moved on to new challenges. He 
and Andino landed jobs as stunt doubles in the movie, "Riders on the Storm," 
which is scheduled for release next spring. Archbold did surfing stunts for 
Patrick Swayze, who plays a bank-robbing surfer. 
</P>
<P>
So Archbold is once again the outlaw surfer, but this time it's only in 
Hollywood.
