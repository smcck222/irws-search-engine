THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appointment of a career National Park Service official as superintendent of 
Yosemite National Park has, happily, squelched for now fears that politics 
would be injected into the selection of administrators of the nation's two 
oldest and most-revered national parks, Yosemite and Yellowstone. But that does 
not mean the job facing 42-year-old Michael V. Finley will not require a leader 
with a keen political sense. All of the divergent forces that come to bear on 
the operation of the national parks converge on Yosemite, where years of study 
and planning have failed to reconcile conflicts that sometimes seem to be 
irreconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone in the National Park Service is up to the job, it should be Finley. 
He has gotten rave reviews during his three years as superintendent of 
Everglades National Park, which is considered the most threatened in the park 
system. "He seems to thrive on tough jobs. He's a real pro," said Paul C. 
Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation Assn. Finley may be 
just the sort of person who is capable of developing creative methods of 
handling the problems of Yosemite, particularly the tremendous visitor 
pressures on Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Should that be the case, it will be because Finley has come up through the 
ranks of the Park Service and is intimately familiar with the conflicts 
involved in trying to achieve the park system's congressional mandate: to 
preserve the natural features of the parks while also making them available for 
the people's enjoyment. He knows how to deal with the concessionaires who run 
the hotels and other money-making ventures in the parks, with the 
environmentalists, and with the Park Service bureaucracy. And while he has had 
a short career with the agency, he also knows the importance of tradition and 
morale among the ranger corps. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent at Yosemite might not know those things if he or she 
instead had been drawn from the senior executive service, a federal management 
super-corps that consists of both career federal officers and political 
appointees. Such a proposal has been kicking around the past few years in the 
Department of the Interior, the Park Service's parent agency. The idea surfaced 
at about the same time the department's top-level political appointees began 
meddling in personnel affairs of the Park Service in violation of traditional 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite and Yellowstone apparently were singled out because they are such 
visible natural catalysts for political controversy. An example was the intense 
criticism unjustly heaped on Yellowstone Supt. Robert Barbee during the 1988 
fire season. If the Yellowstone and Yosemite appointees came from outside the 
Park Service and did not plan full careers in the parks, they might be more 
subject to political manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. apparently has decided this was a bad idea 
and has dropped it. Good. There should be no further thought given to political 
tinkering with the parks. Superintendents must have the freedom to offend 
powerful political groups and economic interests, if necessary, in fulfilling 
their responsibility to protect the natural integrity of the park lands. Only 
if that independence is maintained will the nation's park system have the 
benefit of talented people like Michael Finley.

NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AUDIENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cultural historians have long remarked on America's need for a frontier. First 
there was the American West, conquered by covered wagon. Then more distant 
continents caught the national eye, sought by ocean steamer and battleship. 
Since the early 1980s, America's frontier has been the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
This is less farfetched than it sounds. Ever since Mikhail S. Gorbachev parted 
the Iron Curtain, Americans have been romanticizing the Soviet Union and its 
apparent barrenness. By the thousands they have sent themselves and their 
culture to this New World, and the Soviet Union, with its archaic rituals and 
puritanical cultural traits, has in turn bestowed an aura of exotica on each 
endeavor -- just like a new Amazon or another North Pole. Unfortunately, 
Americans have all too often selected the mediocre from their culture for such 
evangelizing, as in sending Big Macs and Motley Crue to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this past weekend's two-day heavy-metal showdown in Moscow's Lenin 
Stadium. Hyped as the Soviet Union's "Woodstock," much of the press coverage 
has made imperialistic assumptions about the Soviets who flocked to the 
extravaganza. Many reports implied that this was Moscow's first taste of real 
heavy metal, for instance. In fact, such Western bands, including one of the 
festival's headliners, the Scorpions, have toured the Soviet Union in past 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports assumed that Soviet spectators had learned their concert behavior 
from Western videos. In fact, there is a large, well-developed "metalist" 
culture in the Soviet Union that has a complete set of its own rites, including 
concert rituals. There was also an expectation that this event was an 
unmitigated thrill for poor heavy-metal-deprived Soviet adolescents. Did anyone 
consider that maybe this concert could have been no more and no less than a 
big, fun party for Soviet heavy-metal fans -- as it would have been for their 
American peers? There was a pervasive and unwarranted assumption throughout all 
this hype that the Soviets were ignorant of heavy metal and grateful for the 
brush with anything American. 
</P>
<P>
This arrogance has fed into a new cultural fad: Everything Soviet is hip. Every 
interest group -- from trout fishermen to disabled boaters -- wants to hook up 
with a Soviet counterpart. Corporations want to sell their wares to the 
natives; performers gain prestige by singing to them. The Soviets have become a 
bulging reservoir that Americans tap to feel good about themselves, their 
economy and their culture, no matter how mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
So before this American cultural imperialism gets out of hand, we'd like to put 
in a plea for respect and moderation. The heavy-metal fest revealed less about 
changes in the Soviet Union than it did about static American attitudes toward 
the rest of the world.

DESERT

<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to your editorial "Split Allegiances" (Aug. 2). 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the Bureau of Land Management has done a good job on limited 
funds managing our vast desert areas. It is not easy to administer the diverse 
needs of mining, grazing, recreation, ecosystem protection, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the real question is whether we want to use our desert resources 
responsibly or simply close large areas to all but the fortunate few, strong 
enough to put on a backpack and trek into an environment that can vary 50 
degrees in an 8-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than have the National Park Service, with limited desert experience, 
take over, give the experienced BLM the necessary funding to better administer 
this precious resource.

REPRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret Cralle's letter (Aug. 9), on the issue of statehood for Washington, 
D.C., with a population of 650,000, makes a point seriously neglected 
throughout our history. Her example of California's 26 million people having 
two votes in the Senate, just as does Hawaii with its half-million population, 
highlights the reality that our Senate, patterned after England's House of 
Lords, is a gross contradiction of equitable, representative democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy, preserving the advantages of bicameral representation of 
congressional districts and whole state populations, is simple. Its principle, 
proportional representation, governs the vote count of all 12 nations of the 
European Council with the exception of England. 
</P>
<P>
We propose a constitutional amendment giving each U.S. senator a vote in the 
Senate equal to one-half of the fraction of his/her state's population compared 
to the total population of the United States as measured in the last census. 
</P>
<P>
The same principle could be applied by the states to their bicameral 
legislatures.

GIVE INSURANCE CONSUMERS AN ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NADER, Ralph Nader is a consumer advocate and founder of the 
Washington-based Center for Responsive Law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has finally begun hearings to determine 
whether individual insurers should be required to roll back their rates as 
directed by Proposition 103. These hearings will also determine the size of the 
refund checks that consumers will receive from insurers for excess premiums 
charged during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
In evaluating insurers' petitions for exemptions from the rollbacks, Gillespie 
will hear abundant assertions from legions of lawyers and actuaries working for 
the insurance companies. But she will hear little from insurance experts for 
consumers. That's because consumers lack their own team of actuaries and 
lawyers to scrutinize the thousand-plus exemption petitions. Instead, consumers 
will have little recourse but to cross their fingers in the largely vain hope 
that Gillespie, a former insurance-company executive, will act in good faith to 
implement the Proposition 103 rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't have to be this way. The authors of Proposition 103 knew full well 
that consumers would have to be empowered to safeguard the initiative from 
subversion by the industry and its official allies. So when they drafted the 
measure, they included a provision to establish an independent consumer 
insurance organization staffed by insurance experts to intervene on behalf of 
consumers in regulatory proceedings before the commissioner. This is exactly 
what consumers need. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the California Supreme Court ruled that such a provision 
technically violated a state institutional prohibition against naming a private 
corporation in a ballot initiative. But the court did made it clear that the 
Legislature was free to pass a law creating the rate-payer organization. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, Senate President David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) 
introduced such legislation. Taken verbatim from Proposition 103, the Roberti 
bill has been approved by the Senate but faces an uncertain fate in the 
Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, where a vote has been scheduled for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While the measure has thus far received scant attention from the media, it is 
the most innovative consumer protection legislation given serious consideration 
by the Legislature in years. If enacted, California policyholders will be the 
first consumers in the country to have an institutional, yet independent, role 
in their state's insurance rate-review process. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how it would work: Whenever an insurance company mails out its bills, 
it would be required to enclose a notice inviting policyholders to join an 
organization that would fight for their rights and interests before the 
Insurance Department, the courts and the Legislature. After voluntarily paying 
a modest membership fee, member policyholders would elect a board that would 
then hire a staff of professional insurance experts. Because these experts 
would be accountable to consumers only, there would be no danger they would be 
co-opted by special interests (as frequently happens with government consumer 
protection agencies). In addition, the Consumer Insurance Organization would 
involve no expenditure of taxpayer money, nor any out-of-pocket expense for 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
While those legislators who front for the insurance industry argue that 
consumers are already well enough represented by existing consumer groups, they 
know full well that on the regulatory battlefield these groups are badly 
outnumbered by an infinitely larger and wealthier insurance industry. The fact 
is that the half-dozen or so consumer groups in California that are active on 
insurance issues simply do not have the staff or technical capability to 
challenge more than a few of the thousands of exemption petitions and rate 
filings that the commissioner will rule on over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
After being trounced by consumers at the polls last fall, insurers must find it 
very comforting indeed to know that when it comes to implementing the rollbacks 
and rate regulation ordered by Proposition 103, consumers have their hands tied 
behind their backs. For the industry, the next few months of hearings before 
the Insurance Department represent an opportunity to seize the power to 
determine prices that it lost to the voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
For consumers, the inevitable domination of the upcoming hearings by 
insurance-industry lawyers represents a serious threat to their victory last 
fall. Like other consumer protection measures, Proposition 103 is an instrument 
rather than a result. Unless it is applied aggressively and by government 
officials who are serving their rightful masters, it will not produce the 
intended result. And the only way for consumers to make sure that officials 
such as Gillespie act in the public interest is to be there, watching over her 
shoulder every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
After being written off by insurance consumers as cowards, the Legislature has 
unexpectedly been given an opportunity by the state Supreme Court to join with 
consumers in standing up to the industry and ensuring that Proposition 103 
works for consumers. The Legislature must seize this opportunity by passing the 
Roberti bill to establish the Consumer Insurance Organization.

GAMBLING'S FALL: YOU CAN BET ON IT; 
</P>
<P>
AS LEGAL GAMES BURROW INTO OUR LIVES, PUBLIC WILL CALL A HALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By I. NELSON ROSE, I. Nelson Rose is a professor of law at Whittier College and 
an expert on gambling law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a lemonade stand of the '90s: In a suburb of San Diego, the little girl 
had set up her sidewalk card table with a pitcher, glasses and a box filled 
with numbered slips. "Cold lemonade, only $1, " she said, adding, "buy one and 
get a chance to win our big prize -- $25." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing missing was the sign "Void where prohibited by law." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon and Kentucky will begin taking bets on National Football League games 
this fall. No one in either state lottery commission sees the irony, or the 
danger, in basing the games on point spreads set by Nevada oddsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
A third wave of legal gambling is sweeping the country. Twice before in 
American history, gambling was legal virtually everywhere, only to come 
crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
The American colonies were awash in legal gambling. Lotteries were more common 
than today. But by the 1820s and '30s, well-publicized scandals and a surge of 
moral crusading brought lotteries into such disrepute that they were outlawed 
virtually everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The second wave came with the Civil War and the expansion of the Western 
frontier. Licensed casinos dominated the heart of Gold Rush San Francisco and 
tickets for the infamous Louisiana Lottery were sold in every city. Again, 
scandals and Victorian morality spelled the end. In 1910, New York closed its 
race tracks. Even Nevada outlawed all forms of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
The third wave began with the Depression. In the 1930s, Nevada re-legalized 
casinos and 21 states opened race tracks. New Hampshire rediscovered the state 
lottery in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 27 states have off-track betting. Mailboxes are stuffed with "You May 
Already Be a Winner" sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling has come back to the stock market for the first time since the Great 
Crash of 1929, with similar results, when Congress overrode state laws to 
legalize trading in stock index futures. 
</P>
<P>
Small-stakes charity bingo has grown into million-dollar Indian satellite 
bingo, vending machines selling pull-tabs and, in states like Maryland, 
three-reel slot machines. In 14 states, charities run full-scale casinos. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the state lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery tickets are the only consumer products actively promoted and sold by 
the state. The state does not sell toothpaste, or even promote brushing your 
teeth. But it tells people they should gamble. The main marketing concern is 
how to attract new players, who otherwise wouldn't gamble. 
</P>
<P>
Lotteries were made legal because of the old argument: "People are going to 
gamble anyway -- better for government to get the money than organized crime." 
Why, then, is any form of gambling allowed to advertise, particularly one run 
by the state? If making money is the goal, why doesn't the state own 
restaurants, or open its own brothels? 
</P>
<P>
Legal gambling's problem is that it has become too respectable. The state with 
the most forms of legal gambling is Iowa, not exactly a bastion of hedonism. 
Iowa already has a state lottery and on- and off-track betting on both dogs and 
horses, and has legalized, beginning in 1990, riverboat casinos with slot 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
But the pendulum will swing back; in America, gambling eventually 
self-destructs. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to predict the exact scenario of the coming boom and bust, but 
the short-term prediction is easy: more gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling begets gambling. Once the churches and states started their own games 
they lost the right to say that gambling is immoral. Everything became a 
cost/benefit analysis, and gambling makes money. 
</P>
<P>
Most people buy lottery tickets only for a while. States are constantly forced 
to come up with more promotions and new games. Competition for the gambling 
dollar is fierce and players always want games that are faster and easier, with 
at least the illusion of player participation. Eventually we will see video 
poker machines and lottery terminals in every store. 
</P>
<P>
The end will come when the general population says, "This is too much." We like 
our gambling isolated to tourist areas like Las Vegas, not infringing on our 
"real" life. 
</P>
<P>
The crash will be triggered by scandals, inevitable given the cash involved. 
State lotteries, the most heavily regulated, honest businesses in America, have 
already been rigged by insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Sports betting will speed the fall. Think of the message that the state as 
bookie is giving our children: "It's not whether you win or lose but if you 
beat the spread." Other factors include gambling by children, suicides and 
embezzlements; simply too much hard sell. Add in a national desire to return to 
traditional values, and everything we see about us will once again be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s and the first decade of the 21st Century will be the final gambling 
boom. By 2029 it will all be outlawed again -- for a while.

THE BUG IN MY COMPUTER WASN'T A ROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CALVIN TRILLIN, Calvin Trillin is a syndicated columnist in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My friend Jane is worried that she may have a cockroach in her computer. She 
thinks she might have seen one crawl in through the slot where you put the 
floppy disks. Jane's got a problem on her hands. 
</P>
<P>
I won't mention Jane's last name, because she finds it a little embarrassing to 
have a cockroach in her computer. For one thing, it sounds sort of 
inappropriate -- like taking your Honda in and telling the service manager that 
you have reason to believe that it may have a guppy in the crankcase. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it is well known that the cockroach is not a solitary creature, and Jane 
doesn't want her mother to know that her apartment might be crawling with 
cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
She hadn't even been telling her friends. I wouldn't have known about this at 
all if my own computer hadn't developed Disk Error 31. Here are the symptoms of 
Disk Error 31: Occasionally, when you try to save what you've written, you 
erase what you've written instead, and the screen suddenly says "Disk Error 
31." 
</P>
<P>
I tried to find out what Disk Error 31 was. I figured that if someone took the 
trouble to number an error, the number must refer to something, and if you knew 
what it referred to you might be able to figure out what to do about it. I 
figured there was a list somewhere explaining which error was which. One line 
would say, maybe, "Disk Error 29: Loose wiring" and the next line would say 
"Disk Error 30: A little joke from the manufacturer in Seoul, Korea." The line 
after that would identify Disk Error 31. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that there isn't any list -- or if there is, it's highly 
classified. It turns out that Disk Error 31 is like most computer problems: The 
software people tell you that it's your hardware and the hardware people tell 
you that it's your software. A third party may tell you that it's your software 
telling you something about your hardware, or vice-versa. Nobody would admit 
knowing why this particular disk error was called Disk Error 31. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, I quit trying to find out about it. Instead, I just said it over 
and over again, the way some spacey people on the subway chant things, or I 
wrote poems about it. Sometimes, I imagined a scene in which one of the 
hardware people or software people is strapped in a chair, and I am leaning 
against a desk in front of him. A twitchy-looking man with a scar is sitting in 
the corner. I am speaking in the correct tones sometimes used by a German 
officer talking to a downed American pilot in a World War II movie. "I do hope 
you will agree to tell me what Disk Error 31 is," I say. "If not, Herr Mueller 
has his methods." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, my friend James fixed my computer. James knows everything about 
computers -- except, of course, what Disk Error 31 is. I often call him for 
computer advice, even though he spends most of his time in New Iberia, La., and 
I spend most of my time in New York. In this case, he made a house call. He 
fixed my computer by replacing everything inside of it. One of the things he 
replaced contained Disk Error 31. We don't know which one. 
</P>
<P>
Jane, who happened to be visiting at the same time, was so impressed that she 
asked James if he could answer "a rather embarrassing computer question." The 
question was what you do if you think you might have a cockroach in your 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," James said, "they've got these programs that are supposed to get all 
the bugs out, but I don't suppose they mean it that way." Then he didn't say 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
Something suddenly occurred to me. I got everything James had taken out of my 
computer and put it all in the kitchen in the dark. Then, after a while, I 
turned the lights on to see if anything scurried out across the kitchen floor. 
It had occurred to me that the secret list might say "Disk Error 31: cockroach 
in the system." But nothing scurried. Now we'll never know.

 BACK TO BASICS: HOW TO CUT STEAKS FROM WHOLE TURKEY BREASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Turkey breast slices are thin, boneless fillets, sometimes referred to as 
steaks or cutlets. They are all white meat, cut across the grain of the turkey 
breast. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent price check of several local supermarkets, turkey breast slices 
ranged from $4.29 to $5.39 per pound, while whole turkey breasts were $1.69 to 
$3.99 a pound. Despite the weight of bone in the whole breasts, that still 
amounts to a major price difference. 
</P>
<P>
To economize, or if and when turkey breast slices are not available at the 
market, you may cut them yourself from a fresh, thawed or partially thawed 
whole turkey breast. The savings are even greater when you consider that turkey 
breast slices are an excellent substitute for far more expensive veal cutlets. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by placing the turkey breast on a cutting board with the small end 
pointing away from you. Using a large sharp knife, cut through the center of 
the breast (Step 1), down along one side of the keel bone. 
</P>
<P>
Set that half of the breast aside. Then cut down the other side of the keel 
bone (Step 2) to release the second breast half. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the skin from the breast halves by running the point of the knife 
between the flesh and skin (Step 3). Also cut off any excess fat. 
</P>
<P>
Slice the breast meat across the grain into half-inch to one-inch slices for 
steaks, 1/8-inch to 3/8-inch slices for cutlets (Step 4). Use as directed in a 
recipe, saute or pound thinner and prepare as scaloppine, piccata or 
Parmigiana.

 ABOUT WINE: OAK IS TRENDY, NOT ALWAYS TASTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SANTA ROSA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Parducci, one of California's greatest wine makers and a man who does not 
prefer the taste of oak in his wines, once said, "If you want oak, go chew on a 
two-by-four," or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Americans seem smitten by oak flavor in their Cabernet Sauvignons, in 
their Chardonnays and even in wines that clearly would do as well with no oak 
whatever. If this trend continues, I anticipate some day a winery selling a 
bottle full of wine-dipped toothpicks. 
</P>
<P>
Since Americans like the taste and smell of oak in their wine, wine makers 
accommodate them. They oak the most delicate of wines and strip from them the 
very elements that may give them some passing resemblance to the grapes from 
which they were made. 
</P>
<P>
To say which came first is a chicken-and-egg sort of argument. I can't be 
certain whether Americans demanded oak so wine makers gave it to them, or 
whether a few wine makers over-oaked a few wines, the wines received plaudits, 
and that gave other wine makers a great idea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Reminder 
</P>
<P>
Either way, oak is here and it will be with us for at least the remainder of 
the current generation -- a generation that has been carefully taught that if a 
little oak is a good thing, a lumber factory is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
(This should be a reminder to us all that sometimes the wines that win the 
highest praise are, after all, only one style of wine. And that equally as good 
are wines with little or no oak that taste of the grape, but which, for lack of 
"oomph," get none of their richly deserved praise.) 
</P>
<P>
As a part-time wine evaluator, I have a debate on my hands with this recent 
"more is better" school of wine making. On one hand, I realize that big, 
full-flavored, oak-scented wines will be appreciated by a lot of people. So 
when I'm evaluating wine, I understand and deal accordingly with such brooding 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
I, on the other hand, love wine that speaks of the grape, wines that offer 
delicacy. And when I'm not evaluating wine but consuming it with dinner, I try 
to ignore the big guys and go after subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
A discussion of oak came up the other day when I was conducting a tasting of 
newly released Merlots. A few of the wines clearly had a lot of oak, evidence 
of aging in new French-made barrels, and a few of the tasters noted that the 
oak character was a little strong for the fruit in the wine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ample Fruit 
</P>
<P>
Other tasters admitted that the wines in question were oaky, sure, but that 
they had ample amounts of fruit and would obviously be great wines with a few 
years of bottle age. 
</P>
<P>
The debate, I suggested, really centered on the individual's tolerance for oak. 
If you were raised to like a lot of oak in wine, then you're drawn to oaky 
wine; anything less is too simple, too innocuous. If you were raised, 
conversely, on wine that smells and tastes like grapes, then oaky wine bores 
you. It bores me. 
</P>
<P>
But I am being won over to the oaky style of wine if only because California 
(and to a degree Australia) does it so well. Oak can be a seductive element in 
wine, especially great Cabernet Sauvignon, and after a while you can be smitten 
by its charms. 
</P>
<P>
But what is this element that intrigues us all so much? What does it smell like 
and taste like? 
</P>
<P>
That, unfortunately, is a difficult thing to pinpoint because putting into 
words the precise aroma and flavor components of oak can't be done easily with 
standard English terms. Moreover, there is the question of what kind of oak are 
we talking about. There is French oak and there is American oak, and usually 
they are miles apart in terms of flavor components. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Oak of Choice 
</P>
<P>
French oak is the oak of choice in the fine wine districts of California, even 
though it is far more expensive than the American variety -- at $400 a barrel 
it's nearly twice as much as the domestic oak barrels. 
</P>
<P>
French oak tends to give a subtler character when it is young; American oak is 
a bit more pungent. But as barrels age, they become neutral and impart little 
if any oak to wine. The life cycle of a wine barrel is about five years. After 
that it's merely a vessel in which to hold wine, not impart character. 
</P>
<P>
French oak can have a vanilla/chocolate kind of aroma and the perfume of it can 
be heady. It lends to a red wine, especially, a kind of cedary tone and can 
imply roasted nuts. 
</P>
<P>
American oak aromas are more direct, more obvious. When American oak barrels 
are used young and raw, a major component of the aroma of the wine that goes 
into it is dill weed or pickle barrel. More faintly, it gives an impression of 
pine, resin or green olives. 
</P>
<P>
(The differences between these two oaks is more a product of their manufacture 
than of the trees themselves, and if the inside of a barrel is toasted by fire, 
the character of the barrel changes radically. But that's a story for another 
day.) 
</P>
<P>
The choice of which oak to use is often based on price. Most wine makers know 
that French oak's character is more subtle and traditional and that Americans 
tend to like French oak character in wine better than American oak. 
</P>
<P>
However, the successes of some wineries that use American oak has persuaded 
some wine makers that you can make an excellent wine with the less expensive 
oak. (Or is this simply a rationalization?) 
</P>
<P>
Historically, oak barrels were used to give red wine a more mature, developed 
character, not mere oak flavor. In France, oak was used for centuries, before 
stainless steel was invented, to mellow the wine before it was consumed. The 
character that developed so intrigued wine lovers that it became a part of the 
context in which wine was evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, large oak tanks and small oak barrels were used from the 
start of the industry, in the 1850s, and by the latter part of the 19th 
Century, Inglenook and Beaulieu in the Napa Valley had long established the 
idea of aging wine in barrels. But again, not for a hit of oak, but as a means 
of rasping off the rough edges of a new wine. 
</P>
<P>
Beaulieu was one of the first wineries to use oak as a flavoring agent, but 
soon after the end of Prohibition, when Andre Tchelistcheff joined BV to become 
its wine master, that oak was still viewed as only a grace note, not a standout 
element. 
</P>
<P>
BV used American oak (it was then the only kind of oak used in this country), 
but it did so with a clear understanding that the oak itself had a persona that 
could blend with the fruit. Throughout the years, the "BV style" of Cabernet, 
with its faint but still evident note of American oak, has convinced other wine 
makers that such a regimen can make great wine. 
</P>
<P>
But what some wine makers don't know is that the BV system is to use a tiny 
amount of new oak each year, and it is new American oak that lends a wine such 
pungency as to make it briney. Some wine makers have yet to understand this and 
their use of new American oak gives their wines a too-dense oak character. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stunned With Its Charm 
</P>
<P>
Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma was the first U.S. winery to use French oak and its 
first release, a 1957 Chardonnay, was a revelation that stunned California 
watchers with its charm. 
</P>
<P>
Today, French oak is the standard by which classic Cabernets and Chardonnays 
are judged. The fruit of a great wine enhanced by the roasted notes that come 
from the slightly charred interior of a French oak barrel is a component some 
tasters expect. 
</P>
<P>
Those who choose to use American oak run the risk of creating controversial 
wines, liked by some, detested by others for their exotic, non-traditional 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some smaller U.S. barrel producers have made their American 
oak into barrels using French techniques, and the charring so common inside 
French oak barrels is now seen as a component of some American oak barrels too. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the evident American oak character found in the Zinfandels of DeLoach 
and Ridge and the Cabernets of Ridge, Silver Oak, Kenwood and Fetzer is to some 
people an eccentric and curious element that stands out as different. 
</P>
<P>
If one wine seems to withstand the American oak treatment, it is Zinfandel, 
that spicy and often intensely flavored wine whose violet- or cassis-like 
elements seem enhanced by American oak's audacious pungency. 
</P>
<P>
But when ZD in the Napa Valley began years ago to age its Chardonnay in 
American oak, it created a love-or-hate wine. Recently, the 1987 Chardonnay of 
New York State's Wagner Vineyards, which was fermented and aged in American 
oak, created a similar impression. Some traditionalists feel the wine is awful. 
Others who don't see the oak character as a flaw like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stylish Pinot Noir 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stemmler has won plaudits for a stylish Pinot Noir that is aged in 
American oak, and others use American oak for other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the last few years there has been a swing toward more use of French 
oak. For instance, Kenwood and Fetzer, both innovative wine companies, are 
slowly moving away from American oak and toward French. And Silver Oak makes a 
Bonny's Vineyard Cabernet that is aged in half French and half American. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for this is to capture the flavor profile the American consumer 
seems to demand, even though the cost of the French oak barrel is so much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
One winery that has made its reputation on grape flavor and not oak is the 
Louis Martini Winery. Throughout the years, the red wines of this Napa Valley 
property show well early and late, defying the critics who argue that such 
"light style" wines don't age. 
</P>
<P>
For those who like the taste of fruit from the grape without oak, a number of 
wineries should be considered, not the least of which is the Parducci winery, 
whose use of oak is minimal and the wines are excellent. Also, Callaway makes a 
Chardonnay that is not aged in oak, and Rodney Strong, Fetzer, Buena Vista and 
a host of others make Sauvignon Blancs that see no oak. 
</P>
<P>
But oak seems to be an element that enhances many wines, notably Cabernets, and 
although it is appealing, it is also giving a lot of newcomers to wine a false 
sense of what great wine is. Instead of sensing the fruit, they get oak and 
think that's the only way great wine is made. 
</P>
<P>
And what that does is develop a whole generation of folks who think wine is 
made from two-by-fours with grape juice added for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1986 Orlando Jacob's Creek Cabernet Sauvignon ($6) -- This 
wine continues to impress me. Made by the second largest winery in Australia, 
it has perfect Cabernet character: fruit, a slight herbal tea hint and a 
chocolaty-ness. The oak is muted and the tannin is soft enough for immediate 
consumption, but since I first had it nine months ago it has improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two major wine auctions are scheduled for Los Angeles later this year, and one 
of them is the first of a series of wine auctions on the West Coast by the 
English auction house of Christie, Manson &amp; Woods International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Christie auction will be held at the Bel Age Hotel on Saturday, Sept. 23, 
with Christie's chief auctioneer, J. Michael Broadbent, at the podium. 
Broadbent has long headed Christie's Wine Inc., the division of the firm that 
stages regular auctions in London. Broadbent was the "voice" of the first six 
Napa Valley Wine Auctions. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement by Christie's said that the Los Angeles auction is the first of 
"what we hope to be a regular series of (wine) auctions on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
The second major auction announced for Los Angeles is to benefit the American 
Institute of Food and Wine. It is scheduled for Nov. 18 at the Four Seasons 
Hotel. A major wine-tasting event sponsored by the Meritage Society will be 
conducted prior to the auction. 
</P>
<P>
The auction is backed by a large committee of Southern California wine 
collectors. Dennis Foley, who is associated with the San Francisco auction 
house of Butterfield and Butterfield, will be auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>

POSSIBLE VETERANS MEMORIAL GETS LOVING AND LOATHING LOOKS IN CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlsbad artist Kenneth Capps had heard talk about a new veterans memorial 
being considered by the city, so he recently went to check out a model of the 
sculpture on display at his public library. 
</P>
<P>
What he saw was the bronze figure of a dead soldier, wrapped in a shroud, one 
arm dangling over the edge of a simple rectangular pedestal. A combat boot and 
helmet protruded from beneath the burial cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Capps circled the sculpture in disbelief. This, he asked, was a veterans 
memorial? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is a Slap in the Face' 
</P>
<P>
"This thing could be mass produced by Toys R Us," the artist later said. "But 
there are plenty of artists who specialize in this type of vulgarity, this 
crass commercialism, and it seems as though veterans memorials are a catch-all 
for each and every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a memorial to veterans, this is a slap in the face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another viewer of the piece had a different reaction: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful," the woman said, gliding her hand over the smooth 
bronze. "I like it -- the feeling of it, the sadness." 
</P>
<P>
One thing can surely be said about the sculpture, which today ended a five-week 
display split between two of the city's public libraries. Either you love it or 
you hate it. There is no in-between. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been several people who have really liked it," said Chris Holt, 
manager of the La Costa branch library. "But the most typical response is for a 
person to come up, look for a moment, and then take offense at it. The most 
striking thing about this sculpture, though, is that nobody feels lukewarm 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Created by Denver Artist 
</P>
<P>
City officials are considering using the work, created by Denver artist A. 
Thomas Schomberg, as a cornerstone memorial for its expanding parks system, 
after first displaying it outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been after a veterans memorial concept for some time," said Mayor Bud 
Lewis. "And we finally got the council to look into it. But, for a while, we 
weren't sure what kind of memorial we wanted -- a sculpture, a park, an 
amphitheater, a whale-watching tower or what have you." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the intent of the memorial is to honor veterans of all wars, both 
living and dead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Many Bury Heads in the Sand' 
</P>
<P>
"Too many Americans bury their heads in the sand and don't appreciate the human 
sacrifice it took to get what we have today," he said. "We wanted something 
that would make them think." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, one member of a special Veterans Memorial Committee appointed to 
explore the matter saw a version of Schomberg's sculpture on display in 
downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Three copies of the 12-foot-high bronze were originally made. In addition to 
the Denver work and the one being considered by Carlsbad, a third will 
</P>
<P>
be installed soon on the Manhattan campus of Fordham University near Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
After several public meetings, the Carlsbad committee voted to display a model 
of the work. The group plans to next meet Sept. 14 to evaluate the response by 
the public before presenting the results to the City Council for a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of the sculpture is $250,000 -- half paid by the city, but the other 
half is going to have to come from private donations," said Pat Hansen, 
coordinator of programs and exhibits for the Carlsbad libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's so important that people like the sculpture -- enough so that 
they'll donate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responses to the Work 
</P>
<P>
During the two weeks of display in La Costa, 67 people wrote the city to 
respond to the work, Hansen said. The verdict: 15 liked it, 42 did not. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they like the work as a piece of art, but not as a war memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who didn't like it said they wanted something more positive," she 
said. "They said it was depressing and negative, awful, macabre, gruesome and 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as one viewer succinctly put it, "Please, don't do this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Indian Rites 
</P>
<P>
Schomberg said the sculpture was inspired by the burial rites of Plains Indians 
near his home in Sioux City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indians presented their dead on a burial scaffold to represent the 
transition between the world of reality and the spiritual world," he said. 
"I've seen lots of memorials. I didn't want any image of eagles carrying off 
warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"Death is a reality of war. As a realist, I felt that had to be described." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction in Denver, he said, has been overwhelmingly positive. 
</P>
<P>
"One lieutenant colonel wrote me about the first casualty of his platoon," 
Schomberg said. "After viewing the work, he found a release. He said he didn't 
have to carry around the guilt anymore." 
</P>
<P>
And once, he said, he saw a single rose laid at the base of the work. "This 
sculpture isn't meant as a 'Rally 'round the flag, boys,' " Schomberg said. 
"It's a difficult issue, and the reaction must be internal, from the 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
To those who reject his work, Schomberg said: "With them I take a Voltairean 
stand. I accept your view. But it's contrary to my philosophy and my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Browsers Passed It By 
</P>
<P>
In the Carlsbad library, the miniature version of the sculpture sits sandwiched 
between the photocopy machine and a card catalogue file. On Wednesday, several 
library browsers passed by without even noticing it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's intended as a war memorial, but many people only associate the work with 
the Vietnam War and react to it on that basis," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Levinson was one of those. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish everybody would stop wimping and whomping about the Vietnam War and get 
on with their lives," he said. "I disagree with this thing. There's a lot more 
to war than dead bodies. Things are won and lost and often solved in wars. 
Death is just one aspect." 
</P>
<P>
Capps, who described himself as an artist and a military veteran, said the work 
is another copy of an already bad piece of work, the product of people who 
throw the concepts of art and sculpture "around like Frisbees." 
</P>
<P>
"There's already too many of these things on display," he said. "It's like the 
guy in Australia who went from village to village selling this war memorial 
he'd designed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exact Replicas 
</P>
<P>
"There were something like 50 editions of the thing. So each memorial became an 
exact replica of the next guy's." 
</P>
<P>
After viewing the sculpture, Jerry Vincent, a Carlsbad computer analyst, said 
the concept is simple -- maybe too simple. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at this and see a lifeless carcass and you're supposed to feel bad 
there's been a death," said the 31-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would rather see a figure of a soldier on his knees praying, an 
image that could highlight the spirituality of surviving war and one that could 
be interpreted in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
"War has done good for people in the long term," he said. "It's too easy for an 
artist to throw death in people's faces and make them feel bad about it."

COUNTY PREDICTS HEALTH CRISIS, ASKS STATE TO RESTORE $10.5-MILLION CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting to avert a prospective health "catastrophe," San Diego County lawmakers 
Wednesday called on state legislators to attempt to restore $10.5 million in 
local funding slashed from a program designed to provide care for poor adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We now know exactly how catastrophic these cuts will be to San Diego's working 
poor," said San Diego supervisor Leon Williams, who said the reductions would 
prevent many low-income people from receiving any kind of preventive care, 
creating a health "crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Attending a briefing on the topic at the county administration building were 
representatives of each member of the San Diego legislative delegation in 
Sacramento, all of whom vowed to study the issue and attempt to do what they 
could. But there were no assurances of additional aid to bridge the funding 
gap, either via administrative or legislative action. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is actually a statewide one, and counties throughout California are 
bracing for funding shortfalls in the program in September, when the budget 
crunch is first expected to be felt. Statewide, the Administration of Gov. 
George Deukmejian has slashed more than $100 million from the health program, 
including the $10.5 million from San Diego-area expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are in the County Medical Services Program. The program provides state 
funds to pay for emergency and urgent health-care costs for poor adults. The 
effort is considered a key means of providing health care to so-called 
"indigent" people who are uninsured and unable to meet the skyrocketing costs 
of doctors, hospitals and other health providers. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the price tag of indigent health care is considered a critical 
public concern, costing taxpayers, hospitals and other health providers 
hundreds of millions of dollars annually. 
</P>
<P>
The affected state program, said Sandra McChesney, who oversees the effort in 
San Diego for the county, "is the health safety net of the county." 
</P>
<P>
Potentially eligible for the program's assistance, officials say, are up to 
400,000 legal U.S. residents between the ages of 21 and 64 in San Diego County. 
(Care for indigent undocumented people is paid through other programs.) Those 
served by the indigent-care program must demonstrate financial need and cannot 
be eligible for Medi-Cal, the huge state and federally funded health-care 
system, and must have no other source of health-care payments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provided Care for About 25,000 
</P>
<P>
Each year, county officials say, the now-threatened program pays for the care 
of about 25,000 people, mostly single adults and couples without children, who 
may be treated at more than 2 dozen hospitals and clinics. County officials use 
the state funds to reimburse hospitals and other health-care providers. San 
Diego health planners expected to receive about $41 million for the program in 
the 1989-90 fiscal year. Instead, the state has announced that only about $30.5 
million will probably be provided, a cut of more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to fierce criticism of the cutbacks, Deukmejian Administration 
officials have maintained that the slashed funds will probably be made up from 
other sources, notably a federal program to offset the medical costs of 
foreigners newly legalized under the government's amnesty effort. But local 
authorities have disputed that contention, asserting that only a minority of 
those served by the health program are amnesty recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't keep this program together with any substantial cut," said Dr. J. 
William Cox, the county health services director, who characterized the effects 
of the reductions as a "catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
If the cuts are not reversed, Cox said, he will be forced to slash a wide 
variety of health services now funded by the program, including mental health 
treatment and care for many disabling and life-threatening illnesses. He called 
the cuts the "death knell" for the program, which he said had been in effect 
since 1983 and underfunded even before the latest threat.

ENCINITAS OKS HIRING HALL FOR MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Encinitas City Council on Wednesday night voted unanimously to build a 
temporary labor hiring hall for potentially hundreds of migrant workers, making 
it the first such hall in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The council put off for at least a week, however, a vote on a proposed 
ordinance that would make it illegal for employers to solicit workers along 
city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary hiring hall will be east of El Camino Real near Olivenhain Road, 
across from a flower stand where scores of migrant workers gather each day 
seeking work. The land is owned by the billionaire Hunt brothers of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not in Response to Suit 
</P>
<P>
City officials stressed that the move to create the hiring hall was not in 
response to a lawsuit filed last month by an advocacy group on behalf of six 
migrants who claimed they could not find suitable housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by California Rural Legal Assistance, claimed that the city was 
dragging its heels on several issues concerning migrant housing, including the 
development of an emergency shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council approved the concept of a hiring hall in April, actual 
approval had been delayed until a suitable site was found. Before Wednesday's 
meeting, officials had targeted two potential sites, both along El Camino Real 
near Olivenhain Road. One is owned by flower grower Paul Ecke Sr. and the other 
by the Texas-based Hunt brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Both sites are under county jurisdiction, outside Encinitas city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's typical of the way the city has approached this problem," said the Rev. 
Rafael Martinez, executive director of North County Champlaincy, a social 
service group for domestic and migrant Latino laborers. 
</P>
<P>
"To come up with a solution that is, in effect, located in somebody else's back 
yard is just their style." 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Deputy Mayor Pam Slater said the purpose of the hiring hall is to 
clear the streets of workers and prevent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to stop using the street. It's dangerous and it impacts 
businesses to have them there." 
</P>
<P>
The hall, however, would also help protect workers by ensuring their salaries, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, these people work two or three days and then never get paid for 
the work they do," she said. "Under our program, everyone who wants to hire one 
of these workers will have to give their name and address so we have some sort 
of record of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Step Backward? 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the city is taking one step forward with the hiring hall -- and 
one step back with its consideration of the street-hiring ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing the city is making an effort to help people find work," he 
said. "I just wished they'd give their own efforts a chance, to show they have 
faith in their own solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Will Hurt the Workers' 
</P>
<P>
"If this hall is as good as they say, it will take care of the problem. They 
don't need the proposed ordinance. It will hurt the workers. It's not a good 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Maritnez questioned whether one hall will be enough to handle the number of 
migrants seeking daily work in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see how one hall in one location, staffed by just two people, can 
possibly be adequate," he said. "There's just too many workers." 
</P>
<P>
The hall, which will be open 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday, will be 
a covered shelter directed by Gloria Carranza, the city's transients' issues 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Carranza said the $95,000 allocated for the shelter will cover construction and 
be used to hire a bilingual assistant and cover operating expenses of $1,800 a 
month. Land for the temporary facility will be leased for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell, she said, whether one center will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know until we get the thing going," she said. "Rev. Martinez might be 
right. And wouldn't that be nice, to find employment for everyone on the 
streets?"' 
</P>
<P>
Bob LaMarsh, Encinitas fire chief, said the ordinance is not intended to drive 
migrants from the streets. "The law is aimed at solicitors, the people who 
might pull over into a bike lane or stop and impede traffic." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Warren Schafer said the proposed ordinance was being reviewed by 
the Sheriff's Department and would be ready for a council vote, at earliest, by 
next week.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER SENTENCED TO 3 YEARS' PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former elementary schoolteacher who admitted he touched the genital areas of 
a clothed student attending his remedial reading course was sentenced Wednesday 
to three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Reid imposed the sentence on Allen Gross, 
43, of Pomona, who pleaded guilty to a single felony count of child 
endangerment June 21. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain with the district attorney's office, Gross turned in 
his teaching credential and agreed to undergo psychiatric counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Gross also agreed not to have any contact with children unless supervised by 
another adult. 
</P>
<P>
Four misdemeanor child molestation charges and one felony lewd conduct charge 
were dismissed against Gross as part of the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Gross, a former teacher at Malabar Elementary School in East Los Angeles, was 
arrested May 2 on suspicion of molesting five boys ages 9 and 10 who were 
attending his special education remedial reading courses.

TESTS ON SHEEN NEAR EXXON VALDEZ PLANNED; NO LEGAL ACTION SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bluish sheen that appeared near the Exxon Valdez Tuesday as it entered a dry 
dock will be tested and investigated, but probably won't trigger legal action 
by federal or state agencies that have the power to hold Exxon Shipping Co. 
liable, Coast Guard and state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The light sheen was sighted between the ship and a pier shortly after 5:30 p.m. 
as eight tugboats guided the crippled tanker into a repair dock at the National 
Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. Pollution response boats quickly deployed booms to 
contain the sheen and collected samples before cleaning it up, said Nassco 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Another sheen was discovered Wednesday morning, when Nassco workers opened a 
containment boom deployed around the dock's entrance and saw the material on 
the surface of the water within the boom. 
</P>
<P>
That sheen dissipated before samples could be collected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tests Planned 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said it will test samples from Tuesday's sheen or analyze tests 
conducted by Exxon laboratories to determine what the substance was and whether 
the Valdez was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"Either it came from the Valdez, or more likely, it was churned up from the 
bottom by the action of the tugs," said Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg. "It was 
relatively minor." 
</P>
<P>
Nassco officials said bay waters around the shipyard contain oil and fuel, 
which could have been stirred from the bottom during docking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon to see sheens in the bay, when you consider all of the ship 
traffic," said Al Lutter, a senior vice president at Nassco. 
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowledged that the bluish sheen was similar to discharges 
sporadically burped from the Valdez as it sat offshore San Diego for three 
weeks. Tests of such discharges showed they contained large amounts of organic 
matter and "traces" of Alaskan North Slope crude oil, Solberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citation Possible 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Coast Guard tests show the Valdez was the source of the sheen, Exxon 
could be cited by the agency for polluting bay waters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard already has linked two oily sheens to the Valdez. They were 
sighted as the ship sat off San Diego for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to believe it came from the bottom of the bay. But if the ship did 
create a visible sheen, then we would have a pollution case against Exxon," 
Solberg said. "What it will come down to, I don't know, as far as the 
disposition of the case. It's still under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The state, too, could take action if the crippled tanker proved to be the 
source of Tuesday's sheen. Under an agreement between the state and Exxon that 
allowed the ship into San Diego Bay last month, the oil company will be held 
liable for any oil pollution caused by the ship in state waters, which extend 3 
miles from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Action Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
But state officials said Wednesday that legal action was unlikely, because the 
sheen was cleaned up quickly and didn't appear to damage the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"If they got it cleaned up, I doubt we'd pursue anything," said Curt Taucher, a 
spokesman for the state Fish and Game Department, the lead state agency for 
enforcing the agreement. "But if impacts were suffered or were thought to have 
suffered, obviously we'd try to seek damages. I can't imagine we'd get sloppy 
at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The executive officer of the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Ladin 
Delaney, was at Nassco Tuesday night when the sheen was reported and was 
expected to investigate whether the Valdez polluted the waters. Delaney could 
not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez was moved into the dry dock after sitting at a Nassco berth since 
July 30, when it was towed into San Diego Bay for repairs. The ship gradually 
had been raised about 12 feet out of the water at the berth, but no discharges 
or sheens had been sighted, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pumping Began 
</P>
<P>
Nassco workers Wednesday began pumping the water from the dock and ship onto 
barges, which will transfer it to an Exxon tanker for transport to a Northern 
California processing lab. Usually such water would go into the bay, but under 
the agreement between the state and Exxon, the water must be tested for 
contaminants and kept out of the bay, Lutter said. 
</P>
<P>
After the dock and ship are drained, a process expected to take about 10 days, 
federal and state investigators will spend up to nine days inspecting the hull 
and assessing the extent of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard inspectors in San Diego and a team of representatives from the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the state of Alaska, Exxon and Alyeska 
Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies that runs the trans-Alaskan 
pipeline, will investigate the damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Towed 2,200 Miles 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez arrived off San Diego on July 10 after being towed 2,200 miles from 
Alaska, where it hit a reef and spilled 11 million gallons of oil along the 
pristine shoreline. But its entry into San Diego Bay was delayed by the 
discovery of steel plates that were jutting downward from its hull, as well as 
an 18-mile slick nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The plates were eventually removed, and the state and Exxon reached their 
agreement to allow the ship into state waters.

FREE SPEECH DEFENSE BARRED FROM TRIALS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE DENIES ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS CONSTITUTIONAL PLEA ON TRESPASS CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-abortion activists facing trespassing charges from protests at three San 
Diego-area clinics will not be allowed to use the constitutional guarantee of 
free speech as a defense, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge John M. Thompson's order will affect 112 of the 134 
activists charged with trespass at clinic protests April 8, April 29 and June 
10, said James M. Bishop, head deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling marked the second time Thompson has denied the protesters use of a 
specific defense. On Aug. 4, he ruled that all of the activists facing 
misdemeanor charges would not able to put on a "necessity" defense, under which 
they would try to show that the protests were necessary to stop abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to trespassing, charges against the protesters include failure to 
disperse, resisting arrest and eight conspiracy charges, Bishop said. Some 
demonstrators face multiple charges. 
</P>
<P>
There are no felony charges, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson on Wednesday ordered that lawyers will not be allowed to question 
prospective jurors about their views on the First Amendment's free speech 
guarantees and that the protesters cannot say they were at the clinics to 
exercise free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, however, defense lawyers may still be able to claim at the 
end of the case, in their closing arguments to the jury, that the protesters 
were exercising free speech rights. It depends on how the judge hearing the 
case views the evidence, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors said they will be surprised if jurors in any of the series of 
cases -- which begin next week -- hear that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is, no, this is not speech activity, this is conduct," Bishop 
said. The law is "pretty clear," he said, "that if your conduct is interfering 
with a business, physically interfering with a business, then it's not going to 
be protected. And (the protesters) were shutting the clinics down, completely." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Anthony, the lead defense attorney for the anti-abortion activists, did 
not return a phone call Wednesday to his Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson ordered Tuesday that the trial of the eight alleged conspirators go 
first, beginning next Wednesday. Trial of the others will follow consecutively, 
in groups of five, he said.

3 ACCUSED OF CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS IN ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three Escondido council members were accused by political opponents Wednesday 
of breaking city election laws by accepting campaign loans last year that were 
larger than allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations were leveled by the Escondido Common Sense Committee, a group 
that has battled with the three council members, part of a slow-growth 
contingent. A top leader of the committee lost a race for the City Council last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said Wednesday that it took its allegations to the district 
attorney seven weeks ago. A committee official said the group decided to make 
its accusations public partly in the hope that publicity will encourage the 
district attorney's staff to give the matter a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Miller, spokeswoman for the district attorney, said the allegations are 
being reviewed, but a decision on whether to conduct a full-scale investigation 
had not been made. "We are (at) the midpoint," she said. "We have not rejected 
the charges out of hand, nor have we decided to launch a full-scale 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harmon Denied Accusations 
</P>
<P>
The object of the complaints are council members Jerry Harmon, Kris Murphy and 
Carla DeDominicis. Harmon, a veteran councilman, denied the accusations. Murphy 
and DeDominicis, both elected to the council last year, were not reachable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has accused Harmon of breaking Escondido's election laws during 
last year's City Council election by loaning both Murphy and DeDominicis more 
than the $250 allowed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon loaned Murphy $1,739 and DeDominicis $1,424, according to committee 
consultant Lance Stalker, who spoke Wednesday at a press conference. He said 
the loans were reported by Murphy and DeDominicis on their campaign disclosure 
statements filed shortly after their June, 1988, election, and by Harmon on his 
disclosure statement last December. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also alleges that Murphy, a businessman, and DeDominicis, a 
lawyer, both accepted the loans and failed to pay them back within the 60-day 
period specified in city election statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a telephone company executive, said in an interview that he never 
loaned any funds to Murphy or DeDominicis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Money Changed Hands' 
</P>
<P>
"No money changed hands," Harmon said. The amounts involved, he said, were 
spent by his campaign committee on "two or three newspaper ads and a mailer 
right before the election, which also mentioned Carla (DeDominicis) and Kris 
(Murphy) and set out our common objectives." 
</P>
<P>
After the election, Harmon said, the state Fair Political Practices Commission 
ruled that the cost of the political advertising had to be shared by 
DeDominicis and Murphy, even though Harmon had ordered the advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said his two running mates have since paid for their shares of the 
political tracts, which he emphasized were not loans, and had reported the 
expenditures on their political disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said he and his two colleagues had been advised by Terry Knoepp, an 
attorney hired as an independent counsel by the city, that the money did not 
have to be repaid within a specified time "as long as good faith efforts were 
being made to settle the matter." 
</P>
<P>
Committee officials said they had asked Knoepp twice, once in October and once 
in December, to investigate their charges against the so-called slow-growth 
troika and had received no response from him. Knoepp has since been appointed a 
municipal judge and is no longer employed by the city, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Involved in Matter 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Deputy City Atty. Jeff Epp said he heard of the accusations for the 
first time Wednesday and has not been involved in the matter. He said Knoepp 
was hired as a consulting attorney to keep the city attorney's office "out of 
the city's internal politics." 
</P>
<P>
Pat (P.K.) Walker, secretary of the committee and a losing candidate in last 
year's council elections, said the committee "has opened up a can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
The accusations, if proved, could lead to the ouster of the three council 
members from office, and could also throw into question all council votes in 
which they participated since last year's election. 
</P>
<P>
Such a development would leave the city without a council quorum. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said the committee still has the right to submit the matter to the 
county grand jury or to the state attorney general's office if the county 
attorney fails to act. 
</P>
<P>
The group sent a letter to Escondido Mayor Doris Thurston and other city 
officials, asking that the council order city staff members to investigate what 
steps should be taken to "protect the city should a worst-case situation 
develop" and a majority of the council members should be ousted.

ENCINO COMPLEX APPROVED; THEATER DELETED FROM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved a controversial development on Ventura 
Boulevard in Encino on Wednesday, but unanimously stripped from the plan a 
five-screen movie theater opposed by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Heltzer Enterprises plans to build 70,000 square feet of commercial space -- 
primarily retail stores and restaurants -- in the 15900 block of Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to delete the theater cooled the protests of neighbors who feared 
the theaters would cause excessive late-night traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the information we have this morning, we are totally in accord. . . . 
We thought it was an obvious attempt to make Ventura Boulevard a movie capital 
of the world," said Jack S. Hurwitz, who lives closest to the project, on 
Gaviota Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
However, another Gaviota Avenue resident, Kenneth Millman, said he still 
objected to the construction of a parking garage on a lot zoned for residences. 
The council approved the garage after a spokeswoman for Heltzer Enterprises 
said the land already is being used as a parking lot and the developer wants 
only to add a second level underground. 
</P>
<P>
By denying the theater, the council followed the lead of its Planning and 
Environment Committee, which in June barred the theater and attached a long 
list of strict conditions to the project's approval. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved those conditions, which are intended to reduce the 
impact of the development on surrounding residences. They include a ban on 
fast-food restaurants and nightclubs; restrictions concerning lighting, 
landscaping and fence height, and guidelines to prevent the construction's 
making traffic worse on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
At the June committee meeting, Heltzer spokeswoman Gail Gordon had asked for 
more time to develop plans for a smaller theater, but she did not repeat that 
unsuccessful plea to the council Wednesday.

HAWTHORNE DRAWS FIRE FOR INCREASING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council is under fire for imposing increases in water and 
trash collection fees that critics contend should have been subject to a 
citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Raymon Sulser, a candidate for City Council, charged Monday that a water rate 
increase approved by the council last September was, in fact, a tax. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 13 and a later measure, Proposition 62, cities are barred 
from enacting new taxes without approval by a two-thirds' majority of voters. 
However, cities can raise fees to cover the cost of providing services. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday night's City Council meeting, Sulser said the water increase was an 
illegal tax rather than a fee increase based on cost of services. He presented 
figures that he said show the increase has, in some cases, doubled customers' 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Passed On 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they are entitled to pass cost increases on to customers. 
</P>
<P>
The council is also under fire from one its own members. In an Aug. 7 letter, 
Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert asked Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for an opinion on 
whether the city violated Proposition 13 in July when it increased the city's 
refuse collection franchise fee by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fee must be paid by the city's longtime franchisee, H &amp; C 
Disposal Co., the firm will be allowed to pass on the increase to Hawthorne 
residential and business customers. Business customers will be especially 
hard-hit, Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
The council differed sharply over the franchise fee increase, with Mayor Betty 
J. Ainsworth and Councilmen Charles Bookhammer and Steven Andersen voting for 
the measure, and Lambert voting against it. Councilman David M. York was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
The increased fees will raise $550,000 to help offset a $2.5-million budget 
deficit in the 1989-90 budget, according to City Manager R. Kenneth Jue. The 
average household's monthly bill will increase to $10.45 from $9.40, placing 
Hawthorne "right in the ballpark" in comparison with refuse fees in neighboring 
cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In her Aug. 7 letter to Reiner, Lambert asked: "Is this, in fact, a tax 
disguised as a fee in order to circumvent the provisions of Prop. 13, which 
require all new taxes to be placed on the ballot and approved by at least 
two-thirds of the voters?" 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Reiner said that Lambert's letter has been turned over to 
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hickey and that her allegations are "under review to 
determine if a criminal investigation is warranted." No decision has been made, 
the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert also asked Reiner to evaluate the legality of Hawthorne's contract with 
H &amp; C. The city has never subjected its refuse collection services to 
competitive bidding, in spite of a 1984-85 Grand Jury recommendation that it do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that the Grand Jury recommendation was only a suggestion and 
that the city is not bound to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
H &amp; C has held the city's refuse collection contract since 1957. Although 
the current contract was not to expire until 1991, the council voted 3 to 2 in 
March to extend the contract to 1996. The council majority said H &amp; C has 
done a good job and deserved the extension. Ainsworth and Lambert voted against 
the extension. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Reiner, Lambert asked: "Is this a monopoly in the eyes of the 
law, and is it legal? Does the city have a defensible position in this case if 
a citizen files suit?" 
</P>
<P>
Lambert said that because of the lack of competitive bidding, "there have been 
many complaints and several threats of lawsuits" by Hawthorne residents. 
</P>
<P>
No opinion has been issued on this question either, according to Reiner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In another development relating to city fees, the council voted 3 to 0 to table 
the city manager's request to spend $88,000 for consulting advice on fee 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said he needed the consultants' help to determine city costs of providing 
services, so that justifiable fee increases can be arrived at in time for a 
special City Council budget hearing at 7 p.m. Monday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fee increases could be applied to reducing the potential 
$2.5-million deficit, Lambert said she could not justify the expenditure of 
such a large sum for consultants. Lambert, Ainsworth and York voted to table 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
Jue has said that as many as 32 city jobs may be on the line if other ways of 
reducing the deficit can not be found.

PLANNERS SAY NO TO WIND FARM IN HILLS NEAR GORMAN; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL CITES HARM TO BIRDS, RUSTIC SCENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planners on Wednesday rejected a proposal to build the 
county's first power-generating wind farm in the hills northeast of Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Regional Planning Commission said the project would destroy the 
rustic beauty of the area, promote erosion and harm wildlife, after one 
protester warned that the spinning blades of giant turbines would slice up 
passing birds "like they went through a Cuisinart." 
</P>
<P>
The commission unanimously voted down the proposal after a five-hour hearing 
attended by more than 150 people at Santa Clarita City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Zond Systems, the largest producer of wind energy in California, had hoped to 
erect more than 300 windmills -- some as high as 150 feet -- on vacant, 
mountainous land near the tiny community best known as a truck stop along 
Interstate 5, south of the Kern County line. 
</P>
<P>
Zond's proposal drew opposition from a broad coalition that included the 
California Department of Fish and Game, the National Audubon Society, the 
Sierra Club, a citizens group called Save the Mountain Committee, and Tejon 
Ranch, a wealthy landowning corporation with 200,000 acres in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ralphs Family 
</P>
<P>
Tehachapi-based Zond had the backing of the influential Ralphs family, a 
pioneer Gorman clan that founded the supermarket chain. The proposal had 
divided the small town -- Gorman has only 65 registered voters -- for months. 
The Save the Mountain Committee circulated petitions throughout the county and 
submitted more than 3,000 signatures opposing the windmills. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners heard often-conflicting testimony during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Zond officials cited an environmental impact report that declared that the 
$100-million project would not significantly harm wildlife or the environment. 
The report said the proposed site was outside the routes usually traveled by 
the endangered California condor. The giant condor is now confined to 
captivity, but scientists hope to reintroduce the birds to the region in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Blum of the National Audubon Society said the windmills would raise a 
dangerous barrier in a former condor "flyway." Sherry Teresa, a wildlife 
biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, said the environmental 
impact report was deficient. She said it failed to note that three endangered 
species -- the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and Swainson's hawk -- have been 
sighted at the proposed wind farm site. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Hemsath, speaking for the California State Racing Pigeon Organization, 
said, "Our birds would look like they went through a Cuisinart." 
</P>
<P>
But Steven W. Carothers, an environmental consultant for Zond, countered that 
the number of birds killed by windmills statewide is "relatively 
insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
Zond President James Dehlsen tried to persuade the commissioners by touting 
windmills as clean producers of energy that would reduce pollution and the use 
of gas and oil. 'We like to think we're practicing environmentalists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners rejected his argument, saying their concern was land use, not 
utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
Zond had originally proposed building 458 windmills but scaled that proposal 
down to 350. Dehlsen offered to cut back the proposal to 319 so that none of 
the giant machines would be visible from Interstate 5, a common complaint by 
the project's critics. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners were not swayed. 'I really have a problem with this project," 
Commissioner Betty Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lee Strong agreed that the site was ill-suited to a wind farm but 
said that much of the opposition probably came from landowners with their own 
development plans. Referring to the parade of paid experts who testified for 
the opponents, Strong said: 'You can't tell me that the money that has been 
spent comes strictly from the people. It's coming from people who are concerned 
about 'what is going to happen to my piece of property?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dehlsen said it was too soon to predict whether Zond would appeal the 
commission's decision to the Board of Supervisors.

REDONDO REFUSES TO EASE NOISE CURBS AT EDISON PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hearing more than three hours of expert testimony and impassioned pleas, 
the Redondo Beach City Council decided not to change a noise ordinance to 
accommodate Southern California Edison's electric power plant, one of the 
city's principal sources of noise. 
</P>
<P>
A change proposed by company officials, after months of negotiations with City 
Atty. Gordon Phillips, would have established an average noise limit of 64 
decibels at the power plant's borders. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current ordinance, adopted 12 years ago, noise levels are measured at 
a complaining resident's home, with legal limits set at 50 decibels during the 
day and 45 at night. (Fifty decibels is about the noise level of a quiet 
restaurant.) The city staff, including City Prosecutor John Slawson, favored 
the change, saying the existing law is unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
Council members at Tuesday night's meeting said they were impressed with 
Edison's efforts to identify sources of noise at the giant plant and dampen 
them, but finally voted unanimously to wait at least six months before giving 
further consideration to the Edison proposal. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Edison is to complete efforts to mitigate noise from 
generators, fans and other equipment that nearby neighbors say disturbs their 
sleep and their daytime activities. 
</P>
<P>
The city administration was directed to set up continuing tests to determine 
how a 64-decibel limit at the plant's borders translates into noise heard at 
residents' homes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom O'Leary, who said he has been fighting Edison for 13 years over noise 
generated at the plant, questioned whether setting a limit at the plant would 
ensure a tolerable level at homes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's experts have an "impressive vocabulary, but all I've heard are 
opinions and projections with no facts," he said. "It can be 64 decibels at 
Edison but above 50 at my home." He has lived since 1962 in the 500 block of 
North Guadalupe Avenue, which is several blocks from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary, echoed by other speakers, urged the council "not to change the law to 
fit Edison. Don't let this giant utility run this city." 
</P>
<P>
John Haddon, Edison's district manager since 1976, said the firm has compiled a 
"hit list" of 28 noise sources in the plant and will complete sound-muffling 
measures in November. 
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, he said, "there will be a significant reduction, 
but you will still know that the plant is in Redondo Beach." He said Edison 
will guarantee a 64-decibel noise limit at its plant boundary after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Several experts for the city and the company contended Tuesday that measuring 
the average noise at the plant's property line over a period of time, such as 
an hour, is the only workable system for determining compliance with legal 
noise limits. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Davies, a noise consultant hired by the city, said such a system 
eliminates weather factors and problems in determining ambient noise when 
measurements are taken at homes in response to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
When responding to a complaint under the existing code, an enforcement officer 
takes a measurement that includes not only the offending noise but also noise 
from traffic, aircraft and other sources in the community. The experts said it 
is difficult to determine how much of the noise is coming from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
City Prosecutor Slawson said such problems make the current noise ordinance 
virtually unenforceable. In the past eight years, Edison has been taken to 
court only once, he said, and the city lost the case in part because an 
employee failed to take the measurements properly. 
</P>
<P>
"Our officers are no match for Edison experts," Slawson said. "If we have to 
work with ambient noise levels, we will need our own experts, and the ordinance 
will still be difficult to enforce." He said setting a definite decibel limit 
at Edison's boundaries would make it easier to prosecute violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commends Effort 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bostrom, a member of an ad hoc noise committee set up to work with 
Edison, commended the company for making a "tremendous effort" to reduce noise 
levels at the plant. But he said the community needs more time to gauge the 
firm's results before agreeing to new noise-compliance ideas based on unproven 
theories. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary recalled in an interview that noise mitigation measur s taken at the 
Edison plant in the mid-1970s kept noise at an acceptable level for about eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1986, the plant installed two new generating units. The result, 
O'Leary said, is "an industrial roar that is unchanging, undeviating, never 
ending."

INDUSTRY REPORT ADDS TO DISPUTE OVER USE OF ACID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chemical industry-sponsored report says the impact of a large release of 
acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid can be limited by tall walls that would hem 
in the resulting gas cloud and by fine droplet water sprays that would dilute 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The report is intended to aid the design of improved safety systems at 
facilities using the acid throughout the nation. It was written by K. W. Schatz 
of the Mobil Research and Development Corp. and Ronald P. Koopman of the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and describes the results of 
laboratory experiments, wind tunnel tests in the Nevada desert and computer 
simulations. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said an uncontrolled release of the chemical, which is 
used in large quantities at three plants in the South Bay, could be as deadly 
as the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is considering banning or 
restricting the use of hydrofluoric acid, and industry officials are expected 
to use the report to fight any proposed ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inadequate Spray Systems 
</P>
<P>
In May, a senior environmental engineer for an AQMD task force studying 
hydrofluoric acid warned that three of the major Los Angeles County users -- 
including an Allied Signal Corp. plant in El Segundo -- lack adequate water 
spray systems to contain a major release. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, approval of a March, 1990, ballot measure would force Mobil Oil 
Corp. to switch to less deadly sulfuric acid, and a city lawsuit against Mobil 
cites the refinery's use of the substance as justification for needing more 
control over the facility. Mobil generally stores more than 29,000 gallons of 
the acid at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil hailed the report's conclusions as corroborating its position that 
hydrofluoric acid can be used safely. 
</P>
<P>
"Great! Great!" said Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti, when he was told of the 
report's main findings. The refinery is planning to increase its water spray 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But Ralph Nutter, the attorney for Torrance in its lawsuit, noted that Mobil 
was one of the sponsors of the industry group that produced the report and 
added that the tests "appear to be absolutely inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned," he said, "they aren't any safer. It doesn't tell us 
a damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Times obtained a copy of the report Wednesday from the Torrance Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The largest users of hydrofluoric acid in the county are Mobil, the Ultramar 
Refining plant in Wilmington, Golden West Refining Co. and the Powerine Oil Co. 
refinery in Santa Fe Springs and the Allied Signal plant in El Segundo. 
</P>

About half the nation's oil refineries use hydrofluoric acid as one of two 
possible catalysts that boosts the octane of unleaded gasoline; the other is 
sulfuric acid. Allied Signal uses the acid to manufacture refrigerants. 
</P>
<P>
David Schwien, a member of the air quality agency's task force studying 
hydrofluoric acid, said the three facilities that lack adequate water sprays to 
fight a major release are the Powerine, Golden West and Allied Signal plants. 
Schwien said Wednesday that he had not seen the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Texas and Torrance Accidents 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD task force was created in January, 1988. Concern about a release of 
the acid was triggered by the largest accident involving hydrofluoric acid, a 
35,000-gallon release from the Marathon refinery in Texas City, Tex., on Oct. 
30, 1987, and by a thunderous explosion and two-day fire at Mobil's Torrance 
refinery on Nov. 24 and 25, 1987, during which 100 pounds of the substance were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing at the AQMD board meeting that created the hydrofluoric acid task 
force, environmentalists cited the Texas City release, which injured 650 
people, forced the evacuation of 3,000 residents and defoliated trees for 
miles, as having had the potential to be as catastrophic as the Bhopal methyl 
isocyanate gas release in which 3,000 were killed and 200,000 injured in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency recently joined in the conclusion, listing 
the Texas City release among disasters that had the potential to have been as 
bad as Bhopal. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists also pointed to industry-sponsored tests conducted in the 
Nevada desert in 1986 that showed that a two-minute, 1,000-gallon spill of 
hydrofluoric acid could form a dense, ground-hugging cloud of gas and small 
droplets that could be lethal up to five miles downwind. They noted that 
hundreds of thousands of people live within five miles of the facilities using 
the acid in the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wind Tunnel Experiments 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a group of hydrofluoric acid users and manufacturers followed the 
earlier tests with wind tunnel experiments in Nevada on water sprays, as well 
as computer simulations of releases blown against vapor barriers, such as 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
The report is a summary of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming preliminary results released last year, it said that drenching a 
hydrofluoric acid release with large amounts of fine water sprays could turn 
much of an escaping gas cloud into less dangerous puddles of diluted 
hydrofluoric acid. A ratio of 40 times as much water as acid could cut the 
escaping gas to a 10th of its original concentration, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report added that experiments showed that: Water sprays facing upwards are 
more effective than downward sprays; smaller droplets are better than larger 
droplets, and sprays closer to the release are more helpful than sprays farther 
away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire-Hose Sprays 
</P>
<P>
Because water sprays might be dislodged by an explosion, the experimenters also 
studied fire-hose sprays, which have much larger droplets but can be moved into 
position after a blast. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that such sprays provide some protection but are not as 
effective as the fine droplet sprays in general. 
</P>
<P>
"The main conclusion from the program is that water sprays and (fire nozzles), 
properly designed and applied, can be used in mitigating an HF aerosol leak 
with high efficiency," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In a section on vapor barriers, it said that a four-sided enclosure with an 
open top -- known as a "vapor box" -- could also reduce concentrations of acid 
gas and delay the arrival of a gas cloud at a downwind spot by 50 seconds to 
eight minutes and 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vapor Box Effectiveness 
</P>
<P>
Just outside the enclosure, the concentrations could be one fourth to one 15th 
as strong as they would be without any enclosure. Farther away, vapor barriers 
would have much less effect on gas concentrations, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the drawback to vapor boxes is that concentrations inside 
the vapor box would be higher. 
</P>
<P>
The best water spray system currently operating at a major hydrofluoric acid 
user in the county is the 9,000-gallons-a-minute deluge system at the Ultramar 
refinery, which could reduce concentrations of a leak of 225 gallons a minute 
by 90%. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same 90% standard, the Mobil refinery water spray system could 
similarly reduce a hydrofluoric acid leak of 78 gallons a minute. The water 
system at Allied Signal's plant could mitigate a leak of 21 gallons a minute, 
and the one at the Golden West refinery could dilute by 90% a leak of eight 
gallons a minute. The Powerine refinery, which also uses hydrofluoric acid, has 
no spray system.

L.A. CHIDED OVER UNSPENT TRAFFIC SIGNAL FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
KATZ SAYS CITY'S DELAYS MAY ADD $2 MILLION TO COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM'S COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) scolded Los Angeles city transportation 
officials Wednesday for sitting on more than $17 million he helped secure more 
than a year ago for an automated traffic signal system in the southern San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The system, called ATSAC for Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control, uses a 
computer to monitor traffic progress through major intersections and 
automatically changes signals as needed in a wide swath stretching along 
Ventura and Victory boulevards. Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, called it the "smart intersection" project. 
</P>
<P>
When the money was allocated in June, 1988, city transportation officials 
predicted that it could be completed within a year. Plans call for a gradual 
phase-in over the next two years, city transportation manager S. Edwin Rowe 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Cost 
</P>
<P>
Katz told council members who serve on the city Transportation Committee that 
the delays could cause the project to cost up to $2 million more. In the 
meantime, he said, Valley traffic congestion worsens. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we're sitting here wondering how much of the traffic situation could've 
been avoided, how many headaches could've been avoided," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Councilman Nate Holden, committee chairman, Rowe said the 
382-intersection system had been started with a strip of intersections along 
and near Ventura Boulevard, between Reseda and Lankershim boulevards. But later 
he conceded that those intersections had been paid for and constructed by the 
state Department of Transportation in anticipation of traffic congestion on 
side streets during the Ventura Freeway widening. 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't we do it faster? There's no simple answer to that," Rowe said, 
outlining design delays and the labyrinthine process of using outside 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Promised 
</P>
<P>
Rowe promised the committee that he would study ways of speeding up the 
process. But after the meeting, Katz said the department was "still stuck in 
bureaucratic mud." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a lot of pressure from the committee and from me to get 
this done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The money came from various sources: $1.7 million from the state Department of 
Transportation, $3 million from the city's 1988-89 budget and $12.5 million 
from the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said he was particularly concerned that the county commission would vote 
to reallocate its money if it were not spent soon. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony before the board, Rowe explained that several similar 
projects being funded by developers and other independent sources -- including 
one in Hollywood -- are proceeding faster than the Valley project. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Fernando Valley is being treated as a second-class citizen and that's 
not fair," Katz said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PERMIT PROCESS STREAMLINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has introduced an amendment to its 
landslide moratorium ordinance that would streamline the building permit 
process for 37 homeowners on the west end of the Sea View housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, if adopted in two weeks as expected, will become effective Sept. 
29. It affects homeowners in an area just to the east of the Portuguese Bend 
slide area. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the measure, owners of the 37 lots no longer need to apply 
to the City Council for a "moratorium exemption" before beginning the permit 
process to make structural improvements to their homes. The permit process 
still will require adequate drainage and geological reports before building can 
begin in the geologically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
A building moratorium was imposed several years ago in the area of several 
slow-moving landslides on the city's south side. The slides destroyed numerous 
homes and damaged roadways. In the past two years the city has graded and 
removed tons of dirt from the slide area to virtually stop the slides. 
</P>
<P>
City geologists stated in a staff report that the earth is sufficiently stable 
in the Sea View area to permit home improvements like room additions and 
swimming pools, provided care is taken to provide adequate drainage. Swimming 
pools must be equipped with a special leak detection system to warn of excess 
water filtering into the subsurface. Geologists have said that the slides may 
have been activated by excess water from runoff and poor drainage.

MAN TRYING TO KILL PESTS WITH GASOLINE IGNITES 35-ACRE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo man who attempted to eliminate a back-yard squirrel problem by 
pouring gasoline into a hole and igniting it accidently sparked a 35-acre brush 
fire that slightly injured two people and destroyed a neighbor's house, the 
Ventura County Fire Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started behind a home at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in the 800 block of Mission 
Drive when the burning gasoline spread to nearby trees and brush. Authorities 
declined to identify the man who began the blaze. They said he will be billed 
for the cost of fighting it. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to exterminate squirrels by pouring gasoline into a squirrel 
hole and igniting it," said Paula Aliano, department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The fire spread along the side of a canyon, skirting several homes before 
engulfing a house about half a mile from where it began, Aliano said. Two 
residents suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Their identities were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 firefighters extinguished the blaze by 8 p.m., Aliano said. Damage to 
the house and two cars was estimated at $200,000, she said.

<P>
DRUNK DRIVER GETS 7 YEARS IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley drunk driver who caused a collision that killed the mother of 
three young children was sentenced Wednesday to seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Zamora, 23, had a blood alcohol level of 0.20 -- twice the legal limit 
-- when he caused a collision in May that left Anne Adkins, 30, dead. He had 
been driving as fast 80 to 100 m.p.h. on the Simi Valley Freeway when he 
swerved into another lane and hit a car that plowed into Adkins' vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora pleaded guilty to one count of vehicular manslaughter last month in San 
Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins' 4-year-old son was in the back seat of the car and survived the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter read to the court Wednesday, Adkins' mother, Gloria DeHart, said 
the child is haunted by the experience. Frequently he wakes up at night 
screaming, "Don't look. Mommy is dead," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Panics 
</P>
<P>
If his father comes home from work late, the child panics and screams, 
imagining perhaps that his father has been killed too, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins also left behind two daughters, ages 12 and 8, and her husband of 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Adkins' family and Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop pleaded with Judge 
John Farrell to sentence Zamora to the maximum prison term of twelve years. 
</P>
<P>
But Farrell imposed the lesser sentence of seven years, he said, because Zamora 
had no prior criminal record and never had been arrested for any driving or 
alcohol-related offenses. The judge also said that Zamora had pleaded guilty, 
sparing the victim's family the pain of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to the victims, but the legally correct thing to do" was to 
impose the lesser sentence, Farrell said. Under state law, he said, judges are 
supposed to impose a sentence shorter than the maximum unless they find that 
aggravating factors, such as previous convictions, exist.

DRIVER DIES WHEN CAR HITS FREEWAY GUARDRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a car speeding on the Antelope Valley Freeway in Newhall was 
killed Wednesday in a fiery crash when the car hit a guard rail, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the driver, who was burned beyond recognition and was believed 
to be about 40, has not been determined, said Bob Dambacher, spokesman for the 
Los Angeles County medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The car had been driving north at an estimated 90 m.p.h. when it went out of 
control and struck the center divider about 1:30 a.m. near Placerita Canyon 
Road, Officer Ralph lvira said. The car then crossed the northbound lanes, hit 
the guard rail at the shoulder, overturned, and burst into flames.

JUNK COLLECTOR GETS 30 DAYS IN JAIL FOR FAILING TO CLEAR YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Thousand Oaks junk collector, regarded by neighbors as a kindly eccentric, 
received a 30-day jail sentence Wednesday for failing to clear debris from his 
home on Havenwood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Nancy Schreiner said the city had asked only for a seven-day 
jail term and a court-ordered psychological evaluation for Adolph Leben. But 
Municipal Court Judge John Smiley, sitting in Simi Valley, instead handed down 
a 30-day sentence to begin Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Leben, an aerospace planner, was unavailable for comment Wednesday and was not 
represented by an attorney in court, Schreiner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Clean Anything' 
</P>
<P>
A friend and neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous, remarked: "It's not going 
to do him any good to put him in jail. He can't clean anything up when he's in 
jail, can he?" 
</P>
<P>
Schreiner said that Leben could apply for a work furlough and that if he 
cleaned up his property before Sept. 21 he could ask for a modified sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Leben pleaded guilty in April to charges of creating a public nuisance and a 
fire hazard. He was placed on probation and ordered to clean up his yard by 
July 1 but failed to meet that deadline and an extension. 
</P>
<P>
After the city renewed prosecution, the men's club of Leben's church offered to 
help him and began clearing his yard. Club members who attend St. Paschal's 
Baylon Church in Thousand Oaks were planning to return Aug. 5 to finish the 
task when Leben phoned their president and asked them not to come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Organize His Stuff' 
</P>
<P>
"He requested that he have 30 days to organize his stuff before we come by," 
Edward Krol said Wednesday. "He was afraid we'd come there, and he wouldn't 
have any control of what was going out." 
</P>
<P>
Scrap metal and old appliances, woodpiles, rusted cars and rolls of old fencing 
are among the items obscuring Leben's two-story home. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they have long marveled at the growing collection and have 
lodged quiet complaints over the years. But they said they never pushed the 
issue because Leben was quiet, pleasant and frequently offered to help them 
with domestic chores. 
</P>
<P>
A fire at a next-door house in April, in which firefighters were hampered from 
reaching the scene by Leben's debris, prompted some neighbors to reconsider the 
potential dangers of the junk collection. But Schreiner said the timing of the 
fire and the court date in April were coincidental.

DEATH THREAT IN SLAYINGS CASE LABELED RUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statements allegedly made by a key witness in last week's triple murder in 
Clairemont, threatening the life of the prosecuting attorney in the case 
because his name was made public, were dismissed as rumors by the district 
attorney's office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Rodney Nicholson, 24, the man who Deputy Dist. Atty. Lorraine Rooney said 
survived an assault by accused killer Christopher Clark Box, was being sought 
by police Wednesday and was believed to be armed with an Uzi semiautomatic 
weapon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the county Probation Department, an arrest warrant has also 
been issued for Nicholson for a probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said their knowledge of Nicholson's threats came from 
information provided by probation officials, one of whom even asked for police 
protection, said homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Seen Tuesday Morning 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson was last seen at the Probation Department on Tuesday morning, where 
he supposedly told probation officials that he "was going to get" Rooney for 
making his name public during Box's arraignment hearing, said police spokesman 
Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"He was angry because his name had been released to the media," Martinez said. 
"He had a right to be because it put him in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson's name was disclosed by Rooney at Monday's arraignment of Box, 20, 
who was charged in the Aug. 9 murders of April Gilhausen, 20, her son Bryan, 3, 
and Kevin Morton Chandler, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney told the court that Nicholson knocked on Gilhausen's door and was 
assaulted by Box. He did not witness the slayings, Rooney said. A 17-year-old 
youth, described as a football player from Clairemont High School, which Box 
also attended, has also been charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Threats 
</P>
<P>
When Nicholson's name appeared in news accounts of Box's arraignment, a public 
hearing where charges are formally read, Nicholson apparently became angered, 
Martinez said. He was concerned about threats on his life. "There were rumors 
that there were a group of Hispanic males in a car looking for him," Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney on Wednesday said the district attorney's own investigators determined 
that Nicholson never made the statements against her life. "There was no threat 
of any kind," Rooney said. "It was all based on rumors. There is no cause for 
concern at this end." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he doubts that the allegations were unsubstantiated but said they 
were possible. Attempts to reach probation officials for comment were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Casey, a spokesman with the district attorney's office, said the 
department received its initial information from the probation department. 
</P>
<P>
"The statements were certainly cause for further inquiry," Casey said. "How 
explicit, coherent and contextual the statements were, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Rooney, meanwhile, insisted that the information police had received was 
incorrect and blamed the media for blowing the controversy out of proportion.

3 MORE HOLDUPS BRING BANK HEIST TOTAL TO 8 IN 3 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three more bank robberies occurred in San Diego Wednesday, bringing to eight 
the number of banks and savings and loans hit in the last three days, said a 
police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
As in Monday's four robberies, all three robbers Wednesday used demand notes to 
extract cash from a teller. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., a man robbed a branch of the Security Pacific Bank in the 3000 
block of Clairemont Drive, escaping on foot with $1,140, said spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
A second robber hit the Great American Bank branch in the 8500 block of Navajo 
Road at about 2 p.m. and made off with an undetermined amount of cash, 
according to Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Another man robbed the Bank of Commerce office at the corner of 8th Avenue and 
C Street at 3:10 p.m., escaping with $600 to $700. He had a gun tucked inside 
his waistband, Robinson said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED IN PLANE CRASH IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who died in the crash of a single-engine plane on a training flight near 
Castaic was identified as Alfredo Arevalo, 43, of North Hollywood, the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office reported Wednesday. 
</P>

The pilot of the two-seat Cessna, Anthony Cornejo, 22, of Los Angeles, was 
injured in the Tuesday crash and was recovering Wednesday at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills. Hospital spokeswoman Pamela Kouba said he was in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board officials were investigating the crash 
Wednesday but had not determined its cause, a board spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Whiteman Airport in Pacoima shortly after 9 a.m. 
Tuesday, said Joe Silva, Los Angeles County Fire Department inspector. An 
employee of a nearby power plant discovered the wreckage on a steep 
mountainside about 3:45 p.m. and notified authorities.

MAYOR'S CAMPAIGN WORKERS REAPED $200,000 BONUS; 
</P>
<P>
'STREET MONEY' PAVED WAY FOR BRADLEY VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Bradley's bad luck was Aimee Barnes' good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
As the mayor's lead in the April municipal election began to collapse about two 
weeks before election day, his campaign staff, sensing disaster, hired Barnes, 
an unemployed single mother living in a city housing project, and hundreds of 
others as get-out-the-vote precinct walkers, pouring more than $200,000 in 
"street money" into South Los Angeles to increase the size of Bradley's black 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The latest campaign reports, filed Aug. 1, and interviews by Times reporters 
tell the story of a desperate last-minute effort by the Bradley team to save 
the mayor from a potentially disastrous runoff in a campaign gone bad. 
Recruiters hit housing projects, senior citizen centers, student groups, drug 
treatment centers -- wherever people gather -- and offered them money to 
persuade voters to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The effort boosted Bradley's campaign expenditure to $2.6 million, much more 
than his advisers had originally anticipated spending. With him receiving 
165,599 votes, it amounted to spending $15.87 per vote. By contrast, his main 
opponent, City Councilman Nate Holden, spent $226,723 in winning 89,184 votes, 
amounting to $2.54 a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with prominent news reports of Bradley's potential personal financial 
conflicts and with record voter apathy, "we put as many people on the street as 
humanly possible," said one campaign aide. "We threw anybody out there who 
would work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Something for the Kids 
</P>
<P>
For Aimee Barnes, it meant unexpected income. "I spent it on my babies," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And for Bradley, his campaign workers said, it meant a runoff was averted 
because largely black South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles came through for 
the city's black mayor. "A loyal base responded," said Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles), who provided staff help for the effort. It netted him 
52%, enough to avoid a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
While the use of paid precinct workers was not unusual -- Bradley has hired 
them in past elections -- the extent of the operation and the scramble to hire 
workers in the closing days of the campaign provides a revealing look at the 
political weakness of a mayor beset by troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Street money -- payments for walking precincts and getting voters to the polls 
-- has always been the way to win in South Los Angeles, where unemployed and 
underemployed residents cannot afford the luxury of volunteering for political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley has always distanced himself from such efforts, even when they were 
used in his behalf. And he has distanced himself from some of the most famous 
practitioners of street money politics, such as South-Central Los Angeles' 
Democratic Rep. Mervyn Dymally. In fact, politics in the area are defined by 
the tough, street-smart Dymally approach and the more gentlemanly Bradley 
style. 
</P>
<P>
But as the election day neared, and unfavorable news stories increased, the 
Bradley team took a poll. Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said it showed Bradley with 
54%. Some staff members said the poll meant trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a poll, Assemblywoman Waters, one of the most capable 
practitioners of street politics, had the same feeling. "This thing was 
closer," she said. "When you have been in politics as long as I have, you can 
almost smell it. What you see in the news, what you hear on the streets, it all 
comes together and you feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Waters passed on her fears to Chris Hammonds, the deputy campaign manager, and 
to Rae Cunningham, a longtime Bradley campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ahead on Home Turf 
</P>
<P>
The poll showed Bradley was far ahead in the substantially black area reaching 
from Watts west to Baldwin Hills, and running weaker in some other, 
predominantly white, areas. Bradley's leading opponent, Holden, was black, but 
the survey showed that did not help him in South Los Angeles. "The fact that 
Nate was black just meant that he was a black guy running against an 
established quantity," a campaign aide said. 
</P>
<P>
A decision was made by the campaign staff to hit the streets. "It is a basic, 
common political thing," said Waters. "You play to your strength, you play to 
your base and you want to get the people out who are most likely to vote for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Offering between $5 to $10 an hour, Hammonds and assistants went into housing 
projects, senior citizen centers and other gathering places to recruit workers. 
</P>
<P>
The hasty recruitment created unique logistical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Only the young have the energy to walk precincts, but one veteran of the 
operation said that many of the young men were affiliated with gangs. Bloods 
could not walk precincts in Crips turf, for example, and "normally you would 
not send someone from east of the Harbor Freeway west of the Harbor Freeway," 
the campaigner said. "You have to be sensitive to turf." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Earnings 
</P>
<P>
Andre Henry, 28, a computer operator, said he earned $120 for working two 
shifts on election day, getting voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
He said about 1,000 workers participated that day, including pre-teen 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
That night, he said, there was a near riot at the Bradley campaign headquarters 
on Crenshaw Boulevard when there was a delay in paying the workers. Henry said 
he arrived at 8 p.m. and did not get his check for three hours. At one point, 
he said, there was a power failure and the lights went out in a room crowded 
with women and children banging on the door. Gang members looked on from across 
the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty dramatic to see," he said. "People were restless, people were 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles were hired to ferry campaign workers and get people to the 
polls. One campaign official said several were damaged, with total expenses 
approaching $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heavy expenses on the vehicles," said one worker. "That's because it 
was a nightmare controlling the vehicles with all these people. We were just 
trying to make sure they all got back in one piece. People you don't know 
getting into a car they don't own, driving into gang territory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Surplus 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the haste in throwing together the get-out-the-vote effort was 
Bradley's early confidence and his desire to finish the campaign with a 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want to spend the resources," said campaign field director James 
E. Acevedo. "Remember all along the mayor was really being frugal. He 
considered there wasn't that much of a need. We felt we needed to have a 
stronger campaign, needed to have some outreach." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers provide some evidence that the late campaign effort saved Bradley. 
In the 8th City Council District, the turnout was 21% and election experts said 
that putting the vote over 20% in that low-turnout district is an 
accomplishment. In the 10th District, turnout was 25%, and in another 
predominantly black district, the 9th, it was 22%. Citywide turnout was 23%. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to separate the ingredients of a campaign and credit one for 
victory. But there is no arguing with campaign consultant Wright, who said "if 
you win, whatever you do is right and certainly if you were within a point of 
losing or a point of going into a runoff, virtually every dollar spent is 
worthwhile."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL, 13, RECEIVES 27 YEARS TO LIFE IN 
KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old girl convicted of murdering a girl who switched gangs was 
sentenced to 27 years to life in prison Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, sentenced in Compton Juvenile Court, was convicted of first-degree 
murder for the shooting of Patricia Tawana Thomas, 14, on June 2. Despite the 
heavy sentence, as a minor the 13-year-old can only be imprisoned until she is 
25. 
</P>
<P>
The slain girl was a friend of the killer when both belonged to the 118th 
Street East Coast Crips gang, said Dennis Fuhrman, a prosecutor assigned to the 
district attorney's Hardcore Gang Unit.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY PANEL OKS METRO RAIL TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, intensifying the turf war 
between the region's two transit agencies, voted Wednesday to establish a 
subsidiary to take over construction of Metro Rail and all other rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
But Al Perdon, assistant general manager of the rival Southern California Rapid 
Transit District, which is building the first leg of the Metro Rail subway, 
said the RTD remains opposed to allowing the commission to assume control of 
the $1.25-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
Perdon said bringing in a new team to run the project, which an audit ordered 
by the commission concluded is $135 million over budget, would only drive up 
the costs and create a third tier in the county's overlapping transportation 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, the transportation commission's executive director, told the 
panel -- which voted 8 to 3 in favor of the takeover -- he believes that the 
commission has legal grounds to step in and take control of the project because 
of the cost overruns.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $46.5-MILLION WORTH OF COCAINE SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando police and federal drug agents have seized nearly 410 pounds of 
high-grade cocaine worth an estimated $46.5 million in a bust that officials 
said was one of the largest in that police department's history. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities arrested Jose Madera, 48, of Edison, N.J., in San Bernardino County 
Tuesday soon after watching him transfer seven boxes containing the 186 
packages of cocaine from one rented truck to another, which he drove away. No 
other arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Police and federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents had tracked the cocaine for 
four days, first in an undisclosed location in the San Fernando Valley, and 
then in a City of Industry motel parking lot. The drug was being transported in 
a rented truck that also contained 200 boxes of tortilla chips, said Police 
Sgt. Jim Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
Madera, who was arrested in Ontario, is charged with transport and possession 
of cocaine for sale and remains in custody with bail set at $100,000.

MANAGERS OF COLISEUM OFFER TO BUILD CLIPPERS A $100-MILLION ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An offer to build a new $100-million indoor arena on the grounds of Exposition 
Park to replace the Los Angeles Sports Arena was made Wednesday to the Los 
Angeles Clippers basketball franchise by the Coliseum complex's private 
business managers. 
</P>
<P>
The business executives said their offer is contingent on the Clippers signing 
a 30-year lease and approval by the Coliseum Commission of a ground lease to 
the developers. 
</P>
<P>
There were quick indications that neither condition would be a major obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling, who in May had demanded construction of such 
a facility as a condition of signing a long-term lease, reacted to the offer 
with immediate enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luxury Suites 
</P>
<P>
The privately financed arena would have a total seating capacity of 21,500 and 
contain 200 luxury suites and 2,000 club seats. The suites would, for the first 
time, give the Clippers a certain competitive business advantage over the Los 
Angeles Lakers, the highly successful cross-town franchise that has long 
overshadowed them. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan was quick to endorse the offer by 
MCA Inc., Spectacor Management Group and backed by the Pritzker family, owners 
of the Hyatt Regency hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that I will definitely support and recommend to the full 
commission," Riordan said. "I'm very enthusiastic about this. It's the type of 
forward thinking we need to keep teams in the Coliseum complex." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probing the Economics 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said he will promptly appoint a committee of commissioners to study the 
economics of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said: "We're reviewing the proposed lease and expect to move forward 
after getting commission approval. The principals in this venture assure us 
they are putting up all the cash and they say the new arena can be completed in 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Clippers and USC would continue to play basketball in the 
current Sports Arena, a short distance from the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
A new indoor arena in Los Angeles, and a long-term Clippers lease, could put a 
crimp in plans in Orange County to construct a new indoor arena there in either 
Santa Ana or Anaheim. There have been frequent assessments that such an arena 
could not be guaranteed financial viability without a National Basketball Assn. 
franchise, and the NBA is believed unlikely to approve a third franchise, 
besides the Lakers and Clippers, in the Los Angeles-Orange County metropolitan 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said Wednesday night, "I don't know, without a franchise, that there's 
much hope for an arena to be successful in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this offer is a victory for Los Angeles," said the Clippers owner, who 
in recent months had reiterated on numerous occasions that he preferred to keep 
his team in Los Angeles rather than move to Anaheim or Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Participating in Wednesday's meeting besides Sterling were Ed Snider and 
Antonio Tavaras, chairman and president respectively of Spectacor, and Irving 
Azoff, chairman of MCA Inc.'s Music Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First-Class Facility' 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers are an integral part of Los Angeles," Snider said, "and the new 
Sports Arena will provide them with a permanent home, second to none. They are 
a first-class organization and they deserve a first-class facility. Our goal is 
to be ready for the 1991-1992 season." 
</P>
<P>
The new arena would also be used for rock concerts and other entertainment 
events. Plans call for the arena to include "the most comfortable seats, and 
the most advanced technical lights, video and lighting systems in the nation," 
a joint statement issued by the Coliseum private managers and the Clippers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of a new indoor arena and signing of the Clippers to a long-term 
lease would be the most dramatic success yet for the Coliseum's new private 
management arrangement. The same private managers are trying to negotiate a 
deal that would reconstruct the Coliseum in exchange for a new long-term lease 
keeping the Los Angeles Raiders football franchise in Los Angeles.

GAYLERD FALDE; RETIRED HEAD OF LUTHERAN UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Gaylerd L. Falde, leader of the Lutheran Church in the western United 
States for more than three decades, has died after an 18-month battle with bone 
cancer. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Falde died Tuesday at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, where he had 
been a patient since Saturday, his son-in-law, Steve Smith, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Retired in 1983, Falde had served as president of the California District of 
the Evangelical Lutheran Church from 1951 until 1961, when it merged into the 
American Lutheran Church. He then was elected bishop, or president, of that 
denomination's six-state South Pacific District and retained the office for 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Falde had helped build the district from about 30 congregations in 
the late 1940s to 317, with 147,000 members, at the time of his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Falde championed greater leadership roles for women in the 
church, contending that assigning women "to a lesser position in the church 
cannot, in my judgment, be substantiated by Scripture." 
</P>
<P>
Born May 1, 1918, in Canton, S.D., the veteran churchman was educated at St. 
Olaf College and Luther Seminary in Minnesota. He served parishes in Jewell, 
Iowa, and Hawthorne before taking over the church's district management. 
</P>
<P>

CAR KILLS 1 AS IT HITS CAMP OF HOMELESS

A car crashed into a group of sleeping transients in San Diego early Wednesday, 
killing one and injuring two others. 
</P>
<P>
James Edward Gillam, 42, was killed shortly before 1:30 a.m. when a car veered 
off an on-ramp between California 94 and Interstate 5 and plowed through a 
campsite below, said California Highway Patrol officials. Gillam is survived by 
a family in Lemon Grove, according to the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, Catherine Hardie, 28, of San Diego was later arrested on 
suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter, driving under the influence of 
alcohol and being under the influence of methamphetamines, said CHP dispatcher 
Doris Davidson. Hardie suffered a broken collarbone and is under guard at Mercy 
Hospital, a spokeswoman there said. She was listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie's car rammed through ice plant adjoining the on-ramp, falling 70 feet 
into the makeshift campsite, said CHP officer Ray Ramirez. The car flipped over 
and skidded through the camp, dragging Gillam and another man, David Hendry, 
42, until the car came to a stop on a ramp from I-5 to Pershing Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Hendry was taken to UCSD Medical Center, where he is listed in fair condition 
with multiple internal injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Sheri Smith. A third 
transient, W. J. Davis, 54, is in good condition at Mercy Hospital with a 
broken leg, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of transients are sleeping in shrubbery on islands 
alongside highways because they provide a measure of shelter and isolation, 
said Steve Saville, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"They can disappear there and almost form their own community," Saville said, 
predicting that there will be more similar accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is trimming back vegetation near some downtown highways to make the 
areas less attractive to transients, Saville said.

SHELBY, ASTON MARTIN TO RELIVE HISTORIC WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori drove an Aston Martin to 
victory in the 24 Hours of LeMans. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, at Laguna Seca Raceway on the Monterey Peninsula, Shelby, 
Salvadori and the Aston Martin will be reunited as part of the 16th annual 
Monterey Historic Automobile Races. 
</P>
<P>
In celebration of its LeMans win, Aston Martin is building a replica of the 
LeMans pit area in the paddock at Laguna Seca, complete with all three of its 
cars and drivers who were there. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the biggest win of my career," Shelby said before leaving his Bel Air 
home for the reunion. "You know, back then, LeMans way overshadowed the 
Indianapolis 500, world-wide. Winning LeMans at that time was as good as it 
could get. 
</P>
<P>
"The only tragic thing about our get-together is that we lost John Wyer last 
April." 
</P>
<P>
Wyer, who lived in Scottsdale, Ariz., was the team manager for Sir David Brown, 
Aston Martin's founder. Brown, 86, will be at Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
Only five DBR1 models, which finished first and second in 1959 at LeMans, were 
built, and four of them -- including the winning one -- will be on the track at 
Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Frere of Belgium and Maurice Trintignant of France, who drove the 
second-place car, will also be on hand, as will Stirling Moss and Jack Fairman 
of England, who were unable to finish the race in a third Aston Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the last time the whole group will be together," Shelby said. 
"A lot of us are getting up there (in years), and Sir David is 86, so it's 
going to be pretty emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Moss will be right at home. He won the Pacific Grand Prix at Laguna Seca in 
1960 and 1961 in a Lotus-Climax 19. 
</P>
<P>
Others who will drive the assortment of Aston Martins, some of which are valued 
in excess of $5 million, include former world champion Phil Hill of Santa 
Monica, Innes Ireland and Tony Brooks of England -- all either teammates or 
rivals of Shelby when he drove as part of Aston Martin's Formula One effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to seeing Salvadori again," Shelby said. "I'll remind him 
that he ruined the brakes in the first hour, and we had to drive 23 hours with 
warped calipers. But we won." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby, 66, who later gained fame as creator of the Ford-AC Cobra, is building 
Shelby CSX cars and Shelby Dakota pickups at his factory in Whittier. The CSX 
is a Dodge Shadow with a hopped-up engine, plastic wheels and a new-type 
turbocharger designed to eliminate lag time. 
</P>
<P>
Besides 11 factory-owned Aston Martins, there will be close to 30 privately 
owned ones entered in the three days of racing on the historic hillside road 
circuit. The oldest is a 1925 Grand Prix car brought from Japan by Tetsuya 
Takahashi. 
</P>
<P>
Although Aston Martin is the featured marque, the main event Sunday will be a 
race for 1966 to 1983 Formula One cars. Pete Lovely of Tacoma, Wash., who won 
the first race at Laguna Seca in a Ferrari when the track opened in November 
1957, will drive a 1969 Lotus 49B. George Follmer, a former Trans-Am and Can-Am 
champion from Montclair, will drive a 1973 Shadow, a car he helped develop. 
</P>
<P>
The record entry of 350 drivers will be competing on a new layout. The historic 
races have been staged on Laguna Seca's original 1.9-mile course for the last 
15 years, but this weekend, they will use the 2.214-mile Grand Prix loop that 
was built last fall so that the track could be used by the United States Grand 
Prix for motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Bill Sedgwick's win last Saturday night in the Winston West 200 
at Saugus Speedway clinched the series' rookie-of-the-year award for the Van 
Nuys driver. Sedgwick, 34, beat Hershel McGriff, 61, by five car lengths. 
McGriff earlier set a track record of 72.860 m.p.h. in qualifying. Sedgwick, 
driving a Chevrolet Monte Carlo, became the first rookie to win three races in 
a single season. He previously won at Madera and Eureka. Defending series 
champion Roy Smith's third-place finish enabled him to pass Bill Schmitt for 
the series lead, 1,489 points to 1,485, with two events remaining, Sears Point 
on Oct. 1 and Phoenix on Nov. 5. . . . Saugus will celebrate Trucker's Night 
Saturday as the track resumes its weekly sportsman series. . . . Sportsman cars 
will also be featured Saturday night at Orange Show and Cajon Speedways. . . . 
Five NASCAR divisions will compete Sunday night at Ascot Park in the Curb 
Motorsports Winston Racing Series. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- California Racing Assn. leader Jerry Meyer, who expanded his 
margin over Rip Williams and Ron Shuman last week by winning his sixth main 
event in the Parnelli Jones Firestone series, will be back Saturday night at 
Ascot Park, looking for a seventh win. The victory last week was car owner 
Bruce Bromme's 139th CRA victory. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY CYCLES -- Speedway USA in Victorville will hold the fourth round of 
qualifying for the United States Speedway championship Saturday night. Races 
Sept. 7 at Ascot and Sept. 8 at Costa Mesa will set the 16-rider field for the 
U.S. Nationals on Oct. 7 at Costa Mesa. . . . Ronnie Correy of Fullerton 
finished 11th in the Intercontinental Finals last Sunday in England to gain the 
final qualifying spot as the only American rider in the Sept. 2 World Finals at 
Munich, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
LAND SPEED -- The 41st running of the Bonneville Nationals, sanctioned by the 
SoCal Timing Assn., will start Sunday and run for a week on the Bonneville Salt 
Flats. The main target is the 409.27 m.p.h. record for a piston-driven machine, 
established by Bob Summers of Ontario in the Summers Brothers streamliner in 
1965. Among the 300 entries are Jim Lattin of Pomona, president of Bonneville 
Nationals, Inc., drag racing's Don Garlits and motorcycling's Don Vesco. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The eighth round of the Continental Motosport Club's Dodge Truck 
California summer series will be held Sunday at Sunrise Park in Adelanto. The 
series will end Aug. 27 at Carlsbad Raceway. . . . CMC riders will hold their 
weekly meeting Friday night program at Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- Jet dragsters, alcohol funny cars and top gas dragsters will run 
Saturday at Los Angeles County Raceway in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- Young Robby Gordon's domination of the Nevada 500 race was so 
complete that he brought his Ford pickup home nearly one hour ahead of 
runner-up Danny Letner's Porsche-powered two-seat desert buggy in the 441-mile 
race. Gordon finished in 7 hours 58 minutes, Letner in 8 hours 41 minutes. It 
was the second overall win for Gordon, who also won the Baja Internacional. 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITAL REPORT -- Indy-car driver Phil Krueger, 38, remained unconscious in 
Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where his condition is listed as serious. 
Krueger, who went to high school in Tustin, has not regained consciousness 
since his car hit the wall Aug. 6 during the Marlboro 500 at Michigan 
International Speedway. He also suffered broken ribs and a broken left arm. 
</P>
<P>
NECROLOGY -- Ole Bardahl, whose Miss Bardahl hydroplanes won six national 
championships, five Gold Cups and two world championships, died of emphysema 
last week in Seattle, his hometown since 1922. Bardahl, 87, also sponsored cars 
for 21 years in the Indianapolis 500. Four times they finished third, twice 
driven by Rodger Ward and once each by Jimmy Davies and Bobby Unser, the last 
time in 1969.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CUBS GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There was more controversy Wednesday night in Cincinnati, but the Chicago Cubs 
didn't let it affect them. 
</P>
<P>
National League President Bill White was on hand to inquire about a shoving 
incident Tuesday night involving umpire Joe West and Manager Pete Rose and 
second baseman Ron Oester of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cubs remained unruffled as Mike Bielecki (14-5) pitched a three-hitter, 
and Chicago won, 5-1, to retain its 3 1/2-game lead in the East. 
</P>
<P>
There was more good news for the Cubs. Andre Dawson, mired in a slump for more 
than two weeks, seems to be coming out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, who had only five hits in his previous 60 at-bats before hitting a 
three-run home run in the 12th inning to win Tuesday's game, came back with 
three more hits, including a home run. 
</P>
<P>
The shoving incident Tuesday night came in the bottom of the 12th after umpire 
Bill Hohn called Oester out on strikes to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, West came up to take part in the argument between Oester and Hohn. 
Rose, who denied pushing West, stepped between his player and West. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't shove anybody," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Rose shoved umpire Dave Pallone, then-league president Bart 
Giamatti suspended Rose for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, now the commissioner, and Rose are embroiled in a court battle as 
Rose tries to prevent Giamatti from conducting a hearing on whether Rose is 
guilty of gambling on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs simply want to stay ahead of the Mets. They need Dawson's bat to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better now," Dawson said. "You can only go through something like 
that for so long; sooner or later you get your rhythm back. I'm getting it." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, San Francisco 2 -- When it appeared that the Expos' collapse was 
complete, the Giants allowed them to come up for air at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Maldonado, who hit a home run in the seventh inning, dropped a short fly 
ball with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, and three runners raced home 
to give the Expos the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos had lost three in a row and 10 of their previous 12 and had gone from 
a three-game lead in the Eastern Division to third place, four games back. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell's 38th home run and Maldonado's eighth had given the leaders of 
the West a 2-1 lead, and Craig Lefferts retired the first two Expos in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines then doubled, and bullpen ace Steve Bedrosian came in. He walked two 
batters to fill the bases. On a 3-and-2 pitch, Nelson Santovenia hit a pop fly 
to right. Maldonado failed to make the sliding catch, and the Expos had a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
New York 7, San Diego 2 -- Darryl Strawberry hit two home runs at New York, and 
Howard Johnson hit his 29th homer of the season to lead the Mets to their 
eighth victory in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Darling (11-9) won his third in a row, giving up nine hits in 7 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Atlanta 2 -- Rookie shortstop Tim Jones singled home Tom Brunansky 
to cap a three-run eighth inning at St. Louis, then almost became involved in a 
brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Jones went to second base on the throw home on his single, took third on a 
passed ball but was out trying to score on the play. He and Brave catcher John 
Russell engaged in a shoving match and both benches emptied, but no punches 
were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, Houston 4 -- Bobby Bonilla hit a disputed home run with two out 
in the 12th inning at Houston to give the Pirates the victory. 
</P>
<P>
After umpires first ruled Bonilla's drive to right-center field was a double, 
they decided the ball hit above the yellow line and declared it a home run. DAN

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

BREWERS SWEEP YANKEES TO CLOSE IN ON ORIOLES IN AL EAST

<P>
The Brewers tried to keep their anger from erupting Wednesday in Milwaukee 
while they went about completing a sweep of their three-game series with the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie O'Brien had two run-scoring singles, and Paul Molitor went three for 
three to lead the Brewers to a 5-1 victory, their sixth win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
With Baltimore losing, the Brewers moved within 1 1/2 games of first place in 
the American League East. The Yankees, who have lost four of their last five, 
are 7 1/2 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers were upset because they lost hot-hitting second baseman Jim Gantner 
for the season on a takeout play at second base Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers thought that Yankee rookie Marcus Lawton threw a football block on 
Gantner, trying to break up a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Gantner underwent surgery for a torn ligament in his left knee, and it is 
expected to be three months before he can work out. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the clubhouse will tell you, having seen the replay, how 
flagrantly wrong that was, what he did," Molitor said. "He never approached a 
slide per se. It was just, 'Plant that right hand on the ground and throw that 
hip.' That kind of play leads to injury." 
</P>
<P>
Gantner, 35, had been hitting well since the All-Star break, batting .331 
during that stretch and playing a prominent role in the Brewers' surge into 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Billy Spiers of the Brewers was quite upset. It was his low throw 
that left Gantner in a position where he could not protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
Second base umpire Dave Phillips called it a double play, ruling that Lawton 
illegally interfered with Gantner. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 3, Seattle 1 -- Nolan Ryan, pitching with a stiff neck that forced him to 
cut down on his fastball, came up with another big game in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who may be having his best season at 42, relied mostly on his curveball 
and a changeup to hold the Mariners to three hits before leaving with one out 
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
With eight strikeouts, Ryan needs six more to reach 5,000. The victory gave him 
a 14-7 record and put him only 13 short of 300 wins. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolan Ryan is terrific," Texas Manager Bobby Valentine said. "He goes out and 
battles you, even when he's not at his best. He wasn't at his best today. His 
fastball wasn't his fastball. He pitched today." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he didn't mind not reaching 5,000 strikouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting closer," he said. "I'm glad it worked out the way it did. I'd 
rather do it Tuesday (in Arlington, Tex.), but I won't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the stamina I've had the last few games." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Boston 3 -- Even Roger Clemens couldn't prevent the Blue Jays from 
continuing to make themselves at home in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Lee Mazzilli's two-run single culminated a three-run eighth-inning 
rally that brought Toronto from behind to its 15th consecutive win in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays won all six games at Fenway this season. They broke the American 
League record of 13 wins in a row at an opponent's park a couple of games ago. 
The Yankees set it against the St. Louis Browns in 1939-40. 
</P>
<P>
The win kept the Blue Jays, who open a four-game series at Baltimore tonight, 
in a tie with Milwaukee, 1 1/2 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Baltimore 0 -- Don't give up yet on Frank Tanana. The 36-year-old 
left-hander can still pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Tanana (9-10) pitched a two-hitter, struck out nine and denied the Orioles 
their first series sweep at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles had won the first six at Detroit, but Dave Bergman hit a home run, 
and Alan Trammell had a two-run triple for the Tigers, who got only one run and 
seven hits in the first two games of this series. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 6, Oakland 3 -- Brook Jacoby singled home the tie-breaking run, and 
Joe Carter added a two-run single in the eighth inning as the Indians ended a 
four-game losing streak by downing the Athletics at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Olin (1-0) pitched three innings of one-hit relief for his first major 
league victory and Doug Jones pitched two hitless innings for his 28th save. 
</P>
<P>
The A's lead over the Angels in the AL West was reduced to one-half game. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Chicago 4 -- Pat Tabler doubled home the tying run and a little 
later in the eighth inning at Chicago scored what proved to be the winning run 
on Bob Boone's suicide squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Saberhagen (14-5), with help from Jeff Montgomery, equaled his win total 
of last season, when he lost 16. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Ram rookie holdout Cleveland Gary signed a contract to play with the Miami 
Miracle of the Class A Florida State League in 1990, the baseball team 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, a first-round draft choice of the Rams, is a former University of Miami 
fullback who led the team in rushing and receiving last season. 
</P>
<P>
Gary played baseball briefly for the Hurricanes last season. He had two hits 
and two strikeouts in seven at-bats, and no fielding chances. He is a third 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to negotiate earlier with the Atlanta Braves, but that deal fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel Cleveland has both the physical ability and mental approach to make a 
good professional baseball player," Miracle owner Stuart Revo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Miracle is an independent minor league team. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he can hit the curveball," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "That's all 
I've got to say." 
</P>
<P>
Said Willie Gary, Cleveland Gary's agent: "It's not a deal that's going to 
prohibit him from signing with the Rams. Obviously, football has priority." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Gary insisted this is not a negotiating ploy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no leverage situation," he said. "We're still saying that he's ready to 
go to L.A. and play football." 
</P>
<P>
Free-agent offensive lineman Mark Schmidt left the Rams' training camp at Cal 
State Fullerton with a concussion Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital for observation and is scheduled 
to be released today.

It's official. Home Box Office will take over the management of Movietime, the 
basic cable channel that promotes and covers the Hollywood film industry, 
Movietime's board of directors announced this week. Sources at Movietime say 
that HBO intends to turn the 24-hour a day channel into "the CNN of the 
entertainment world." HBO will now oversee all sales, marketing and programming 
operations at Movietime, which is owned jointly by several large entertainment 
conglomerates and cable operators. HBO, which owns about 10% of the company, 
also plans to break into the world of basic cable with an all-comedy channel 
later this year. Shauna Snow

'MISSISSIPPI BURNING' CATCHES FIRE

With "Twins" and "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" past their peaks, "Dangerous 
Liaisons" (No. 3) has an outside chance of sneaking past them into the No. 1 
position on the Billboard video rental chart. "Mississippi Burning" is burning 
up the chart, climbing to No. 6 in just two weeks. Though generally regarded as 
inferior to the original, "The Fly II," which grossed a noteworthy $19.6 
million, could be the biggest rental in the horror genre since "Child's Play." 
</P>
<P>
* Mel Gibson fans appear to be eager for anything starring their hero. "Tequila 
Sunrise," with Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell, grossed nearly $40 million 
in theaters and debuted at No. 11 on the video rental chart. Look for this 
1930s-style romantic drama to end up somewhere in the Top Five.

As part of their "Steel Wheels" tour, the Rolling Stones are opening up New 
York's Shea Stadium to rock 'n' roll for the first time in six years. The 
Stones will perform two shows at the home of the New York Mets on Oct. 26 and 
Oct. 28, with a third show possible, according to New York City Parks 
Commissioner Henry Stern. Stern said the Stones' visit would revive a Shea 
tradition that started with the Beatles' historic performances there 25 years 
ago. The stadium has been dark to rock since the Police played there in 1983. . 
. . In other instances of Stones mania, fans swarmed ticket outlets throughout 
Northern California on Wednesday as Nov. 4 and 5 concerts at the Oakland 
Coliseum were announced. The concert dates had been announced in San Francisco 
15 minutes before the tickets went on sale at 9 a.m. Long lines were reported 
at most ticket locations and promoters expected the 50,000 tickets for each 
reserved-seat concert would sell out by the end of the day. The Stones last 
played the Bay Area eight years ago. Shauna Snow

KCBS-TV's onscreen twosome, co-anchors Bree Walker and Jim Lampley, have 
reportedly been a twosome offscreen ever since they paired up on Channel 2 in 
October. Now the Herald-Examiner reports that the two have told co-workers that 
they plan to marry as soon as both of their divorces are final. The pair, who 
anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts Mondays through Thursdays and the 6 and 11 
p.m. segments Sunday, could not be reached for comment. Shauna Snow

FAIR READIES DOWN-HOME DELIGHTS

Last-minute preparations went more smoothly than usual, a record number of 
county residents entered their dairy goats, pomegranate jelly, patchwork quilts 
and homemade beer, and there has been hardly a peep from the Save The Fair 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this year's Ventura County Fair promises to be one of the 
smoothest, most successful yet, said Jeremy Ferris, who after five years as 
fair general manager plans to leave at the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came on board I gave a commitment of three to five years, and 
this is five years," he said. "It's just time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the 114th annual fair, which started yesterday and will run 
through Aug. 27, were unmarred by a two-year-old controversy over what some 
critics saw as big-city commercialization of a homespun tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The furor was touched off in late 1987 when Ferris dismissed longtime home arts 
superintendent Edna Mills over an apparent personality conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The move was seen by some as an affront to cherished homespun values and as a 
step toward what critics called commercialization of the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The Save The Fair Committee circulated petitions calling for Mills' 
reinstatement and Ferris' resignation. The group also demanded that the fair 
return to an October schedule. Ferris changed the fair's schedule to August in 
an attempt to draw a larger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Henniger, of Oak View, who led the committee's efforts," acknowledged 
that "we did our thing and crawled somewhat back into the woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
Mills was not reinstated and the fair remains an August event, but Henniger 
said the 300-member Save The Fair group scored some significant victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall," he said, "we do feel that the fair has in a sense come back to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
He credited the group with defeating the city of Ventura's plans last November 
to contribute $20 million toward a 120,000-square-foot event center at the 
fairgrounds for concerts, trade shows and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't going to benefit the people here, except maybe some hotels and 
restaurants," he said. "I think we have made people stop and think about where 
the fair was going." 
</P>
<P>
He said he and some other Save The Fair activists are writing to Gov. George 
Deukmejian, asking that fair volunteers be appointed to the next vacancies on 
the fair board. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is a grass-roots fair," he said, "something that is run by the 
people who live here, for the people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
Ferris defended the fair's commercial elements, saying the fair can accommodate 
so many exhibits and entries only because of its commercial success. The event 
costs $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Don Dufau, president of the Ventura County Fair board of directors, said, 
"We're kind of pinching ourselves, everything's back to normal and we haven't 
had the problems that we'd had the last two years in terms of the Save The Fair 
Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Dufau said the board plans to hire a new general manager by the time Ferris 
leaves and is looking for a consulting firm to conduct the search. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons the 12-day fair retains a traditional flavor despite the 
carnival rides and salespeople hawking Jacuzzis and kitchen utensils is because 
of its more than 2,000 volunteers, Ferris said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fair couldn't go on without the volunteers," he said. "It would be 
horrendously expensive to have paid people come in and do all that they do, and 
it would not be as natural a coming-from-the-heart kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
As Ferris walked through the grounds two days before the fair's opening day on 
Wednesday, he pointed out some fair highlights and greeted volunteers, all of 
whom seemed to know him on sight. 
</P>
<P>
"This fair is a real traditional fair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some that have become entertainment shows or just commercial shows, 
and the backbone of this one are the exhibits of the people in the county, and 
we bend over backward to keep it that way," he said, strolling through one of 
his favorite attractions, the Home Arts Building. 
</P>
<P>
"The culture of Ventura County is in this room," he said, gesturing toward rows 
of handcrafted items such as crocheted doll's dresses, gowns, Christmas 
ornaments and quilts in a myriad of colors and designs. 
</P>
<P>
Further down, a long table strewn with the remnants of homemade pies looked as 
if a Boy Scout troop had descended upon it just before a month-long camping 
trip where the only food was to be tubers and tree bark. 
</P>
<P>
The judges had mauled the culinary creations -- poking, prodding and testing 
them for flakiness, texture and flavor, and awarding ribbons to the best. But 
because many fair volunteers are more than happy to dispatch the rejects, 
losing entries usually manage to find their way to more appreciative eaters on 
the fairgrounds, Ferris said. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole area just smells great," Ferris said, inhaling deeply. 
</P>
<P>
In the floriculture building, volunteer supervisor Barbara Schneider 
sweet-talked Ferris into a home-baked confection swiped from the baked-goods 
table. "Occupational hazard," Ferris said, as he munched agreeably. 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials expect to draw 300,000 visitors this year, 30,000 more than last 
year, with such events as the Chase Bros. Calving Exhibit, where each day, two 
cows are expected to give birth; the 4-H and FFA Junior Livestock Auction on 
Aug. 25; a rodeo Aug. 26 and 27 and several big-name entertainers such as Tony 
Bennett, Cab Calloway, Mike and the Mechanics, Tone Loc and the Oak Ridge Boys. 
</P>
<P>
Concert tickets are available at the fair's box office and at TicketMaster 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include a tractor pull Aug. 19; the Fiesta Del Charro, a 
Latino rodeo and horsemanship exhibition Aug. 20; a senior dance contest Aug. 
22; Discovery '89, an amateur talent contest, Aug. 23; a men's and women's arm 
wrestling competition and a chili cook-off Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
General admission to the fair, open from 11 a.m. until midnight until Aug. 27, 
is $5. Park-and-ride lots are available at the Ventura County Government 
Center, Ventura High School and Buenaventura Plaza. Shuttle buses run every 30 
minutes until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to have something here for everyone, to make it worth coming out to 
see," Ferris said.

BEACH CATS MAY SWAP LOW TIDE FOR HIGH DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
ACTON ACTIVIST BEGINS TRAPPING FERAL FELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An animal-welfare activist this week set the first traps in his campaign to 
remove the cats that for decades have lived in the beachfront rocks along the 
promenade outside Ventura's Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Grillo, who runs a private cat shelter in the high desert near Acton, 
received an endorsement of the move from the state Parks and Recreation 
Department, which controls San Buenaventura State Beach. Grillo said the two 
dozen cats there -- remnants of a colony that at one time numbered about 100 -- 
are sick or dying. 
</P>
<P>
But both he and state officials believe the trapping will face severe 
opposition from several quarters. Animal lovers have long enjoyed watching the 
cats scamper along the rocks, and a small but devoted corps of volunteers has 
fed them daily. Previous attempts to interfere with what has become something 
of a Ventura institution have met with resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had reports of assaults on people trying to work out this problem," said 
Steve Treanor, Ventura district superintendent for the state Parks and 
Recreation Department, adding that an elderly woman once pelted him with cat 
food when she mistakenly thought he was trying to run down a cat on his 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce George, president of the Humane Society of Ventura County, cited "a very 
militant group" that has blocked trapping efforts. "We've had officers whose 
lives were threatened," she said. "There have been so many agencies involved. 
Nobody really wants to get into it with these people." 
</P>
<P>
Grillo said onlookers hurled rocks at him and sabotaged his traps when he tried 
to organize a similar rescue a few years ago. But what he described as the 
cats' deteriorating health makes the move necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation, 
agrees that the cats should go. She said her department, which is under 
contract with the city of Ventura, has not dealt extensively with the cats 
since city officials issued orders in 1981 to steer clear of them. However, she 
said, they constitute a public health menace in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, rabid bats are found at the nearby Ventura County fairgrounds and 
along the Ventura River, and "it's just a matter of time," she said, before the 
cat colony is infected. Many of the cats have upper-respiratory infections, she 
added, and a couple have died painfully after warming themselves on cold nights 
under the hoods of cars in a nearby parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
For such reasons, state parks officials provided Grillo with a letter that he 
had requested, approving the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good to have the cats out there," Treanor said. "Those cats have a 
very low quality of life. They spread diseases among themselves. And when they 
die, they die in the rocks, creating a health hazard. It's an artificially 
created situation, and we try to manage for the most natural conditions." 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, cats have been abandoned on the beachfront rocks for as long 
as 25 years. Food and water would be set out for them by well-intentioned cat 
lovers, who inadvertently encouraged others to abandon cats in a place where 
they would receive some care, animal control officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the colony had grown so large that the city planned to trap the cats 
and turn them over to the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was scrapped in the wake of a public outcry. The Humane Society was 
allowed to trap some cats and spay or neuter them and return them to the rocks. 
Society officials say a few had to be killed. The city's policy since has been 
to let the cats alone, except when a health threat is apparent, said Carol 
Green, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Just how apparent it is now might be a subject for debate. 
</P>
<P>
"They ain't sick," said 90-year-old Florence Cardone, a stooped but feisty 
figure in a red hat who has hauled canned food to the cats on a metal cart 
almost every morning since 1976. "They live out their lives here pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Also skeptical is Ralph Weigel, one of the 1980 plan's most vocal opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm highly suspicious," said Weigel, who quit the Humane Society's board of 
directors to protest the 1980 trapping. "There must be so many cats closer to 
them that need attention. Why are they coming up here?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Their Own Free Will' 
</P>
<P>
"The cats are there of their own free will," he added. "They're not tied, 
they're not fenced. They can live very safely in those rocks, as long as they 
have food and water." 
</P>
<P>
Weigel said he believes the cats are healthy. But he said he could support 
Grillo's plan if it is proven to him that the cats are ill. "The time is coming 
when, in spite of anything you do, they're going to get those cats out of 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Borghi, another leader in the fight to keep the cats, said the animals 
are no more sickly than any population of house cats would be. He said a 
veterinarian, whom he would not identify, has checked them out and found only 
minor problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why this crap comes up every few years," he said. "This guy has 
no business up here. Is he a vivisectionist or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Borghi warned that hundreds of cats would be deliberately abandoned on the 
beach if the trapping persists. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Grillo set out five traps baited with antibiotic-laced cat food but 
failed to catch any cats. He hopes to devise a system using traps and nets and 
to round up half a dozen Ventura volunteers. The volunteers would not only help 
in the trapping of the timid animals, which is expected to last a month, but 
would also monitor the rocks afterward for additional strays. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offering an ideal solution," he said. "They will live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kills No Animals 
</P>
<P>
A former actor, Grillo runs three shelters for about 400 dogs and 200 cats 
under the auspices of DELTA (Dedication and Everlasting Love to Animals), a 
nonprofit group he founded in 1979. The animals are all pets that have been 
abandoned and have adapted to living on their own. Those that can't be given to 
families live out their lives in the shelters; Grillo kills no animals and even 
runs what amounts to a hospice for cats with terminal diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo said the Ventura cats would occupy a room in a rural ranch house, 
complete with couches, air conditioning, fireplace, potbelly stove, studio and 
cathedral ceilings. The 150 cats in the shelter roam at will from room to room, 
lounging on cat furniture and romping with cat toys in the house and in the 
house's fenced 3,000-square-foot yard. Grillo said he eventually would like to 
build a wing for beach cats and have the sounds of surf piped in to comfort 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo and DELTA, whose $750,000 annual budget is raised strictly through 
private donations, have received high praise from Los Angeles County animal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spoiled Rotten' 
</P>
<P>
"His animals are spoiled rotten," said John Rozier, Castaic district supervisor 
for the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control. "They're all 
fat and sassy. Food, water and litter boxes are plentiful. They're all his 
personal loves." 
</P>
<P>
"People ought to be thinking about which is a better life for those cats in 
Ventura," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo says much the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what the hell they're doing here if they've allowed the situation 
to degenerate this far," he said. "These so-called animal-lovers have really 
screwed things up." 
</P>
<P>
Cats have gotten sick from canned food, which isn't nutritious enough in the 
first place, spoiling in the summer sun, he said. Medicine he has offered the 
feeders has gone unused, and the cats have gone unvaccinated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A beach walk with Grillo is a grim stroll through what he conveys as a feline 
emergency room. He pointed out glazed eyes and mite-infested ears and hematomas 
that he said will blossom into raging infections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Flea Anemia' 
</P>
<P>
"See that tabby?," he said. "She's 6 months old, and she'll die from flea 
anemia. She probably has 19% or 20% red blood cells now, and it should be twice 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"See that black one on the end? He's too sick to even eat. He's probably got a 
kidney infection -- you can tell by the way he walks, and look at that rapid 
breathing; that's probably a temperature of 104. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, baby," he purred to a kitten. "Yes, you'd be so happy if you just jumped 
in my pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Grillo had trouble restraining himself when he encountered a woman who was 
enticing a cat with milk in a plastic bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the worst thing for them," he said. "It gives them diarrhea. How can 
they have an immune system with so much stress out here?" 
</P>
<P>
Grillo acknowledged that he and his wife, Jan, who first encountered the 
Ventura cats on a getaway weekend eight years ago, get emotional on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine they're kids," he said. "Imagine there are two dozen kids living on 
these rocks with cholera and rickets. That's how these cats are to us."

$225-MILLION TRAFFIC OVERHAUL URGED TO HELP LONG BEACH GO WITH THE FLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consultant has recommended a $225-million program to improve traffic flow in 
the city, including building overpasses at crowded intersections and either 
widening major streets or prohibiting parking on them during commute hours. 
</P>
<P>
In a finding that could come as a blow to slow-growth forces, consultant 
Patrick A. Gibson of Barton-Aschman Associates Inc. of Pasadena said congestion 
on Long Beach streets will increase 30% during the next 20 years -- even if new 
development is virtually halted. 
</P>
<P>
That is because many commuters use Long Beach streets on their way to Orange 
County or other cities, a practice likely to increase as traffic on the San 
Diego Freeway worsens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were the preliminary findings of an eight-month, $343,950 
study aimed at predicting how much traffic would be carried by Long Beach 
streets in the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls for Additional Lanes 
</P>
<P>
In presentations Monday to the Redevelopment Agency board and the city's 
Citizens Transportation Task Force, Gibson called for adding new lanes in each 
direction on the San Diego, Artesia, San Gabriel River and Long Beach freeways, 
and doubling the size of the public transit bus fleet. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended widening major east-west streets, including Ocean Boulevard, 
Pacific Coast Highway, Broadway, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, Anaheim and Spring 
streets, or converting on-street parking spaces to traffic lanes during rush 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Similar measures are required on some north-south avenues to increase their 
capacity, Gibson said. Among them are Alamitos, Martin Luther King Jr., 
Atlantic and Clark avenues and Lakewood Boulevard. He suggested the same 
treatment for Los Coyotes Diagonal. 
</P>
<P>
The only place in Long Beach where road widening would be necessary and would 
require the removal of buildings would be at a bottleneck on 7th street, just 
west of the intersection with Pacific Coast Highway and Bellflower Boulevard, 
he said. About 10 houses would have to be razed on the north side of 7th Street 
to improve traffic flow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That same intersection -- known to commuters as the dreaded "iron triangle" -- 
was one of three that Gibson believes are already overcrowded and in need of 
overpasses or underpasses to move traffic faster. The other two are the Traffic 
Circle and the intersection of Ocean Boulevard, Alamitos Avenue and Shoreline 
Drive. Future overpasses or underpasses will be needed at the intersection of 
Spring Street and Lakewood Boulevard, and Pacific Coast Highway and 2nd Street, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh Street would remain the city's premier east-west route. Gibson said 
that little-known DeForest Avenue, just east of the Los Angeles River, should 
be converted into a major link between 7th Street and Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The rush-hour parking prohibitions and street widenings are among the cheapest 
and most effective solutions to Long Beach's traffic woes, costing about $25 
million, according to the study. Building the overpasses at major intersections 
could cost $110 million, the most expensive item on Gibson's list of proposed 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Additional parking garages could cost $20 million and various improvements to 
increase the traffic-handling capacity of streets would cost $25 million, 
according to the preliminary findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Double Bus Fleet 
</P>
<P>
As another option, the city could spend $60 million to double the size of the 
Long Beach Transit bus fleet and a shuttle system to move downtown workers from 
parking lots to their offices. But even with a massive increase in carrying 
capacity, Gibson estimated that only 6%, up from the current 2%, of downtown 
employees would take buses to work. 
</P>
<P>
He endorsed the idea of a downtown monorail, a concept being bandied about by 
Disney Development Corp., which is thinking of building a $1-billion theme park 
at the site of the Queen Mary, and a group of other major developers. "I think 
a monorail or fixed guideway system in downtown is eminently practical," he 
said. Besides moving people around from building to building, it could serve to 
move people from remote parking lots to offices. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will be working with Disney to consider the traffic effects of any 
project the firm may build. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for the improvements, Gibson suggested a fee on developers to offset the 
congestion caused by their new buildings. The potential costs of making the 
improvements in Long Beach would be in the range of those paid in sections of 
Los Angeles by developers -- and the rewards would be far greater, he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the recommendations will be easy to follow, he said. But the city will 
have to weigh its desire to conquer its traffic congestion against any 
inconveniences that might be created by the suggested solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Solomon, political action chairman of the Long Beach Area Citizens 
Involved, a group that supports controlled growth, said the report defies logic 
when it states that limiting downtown construction will not lessen demands on 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Otto, who is chairman of the transportation task force, said the study 
appears to be a "state-of-the-art" document that will receive a lot of 
consideration.

DOWNEY PICKS CUDAHY CHIEF AS CITY MANAGER; 
</P>
<P>
GERALD CATON SAYS HE WILL FOCUS ON SHOPPING CENTER EXPANSION, SEARCH FOR NEW 
POLICE CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials Tuesday chose Cudahy City Manager Gerald M. Caton to replace 
retiring Downey City Manager Don Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Caton, 38, was unanimously selected to replace Davis, who has been Downey city 
manager since June, 1985. Davis, 53, will retire Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Administrative Services Director Lee Powell will be acting city manager 
until Caton comes aboard in October. 
</P>
<P>
In his new post, Caton said he will receive an annual salary of $105,000, which 
is an increase of about $25,000 above his current pay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good opportunity," Caton said Tuesday night. "Downey is the 
premier city in the southeast county." 
</P>
<P>
Caton will be leaving Cudahy, a densely populated and predominantly Latino 
community of 21,000, for a mostly white middle-and-upper-income community of 
more than 86,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy's general operating budget for fiscal year 1989-90 is about $5.2 
million, while Downey's general operating budget is nearly $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Caton was one of three finalists from among 40 candidates for the post, Downey 
Mayor Randall R. Barb said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Manager Praised 
</P>
<P>
Barb said Caton has two urgent goals: to continue the city's redevelopment 
efforts and to keep gang and drug problems under control. Caton, he said, fits 
the needs of Downey with his experience in Cudahy and his ability to make 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"He has brought the city of Cudahy through serious financial problems and was 
able to get federal grants," Barb said. "Also, he was successful as the 
director of the redevelopment program there." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrives at Downey, Caton said he will have many priorities: "One of the 
things internally is the police chief will be retiring. I will be working on 
the selection for police chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, the Stonewood shopping center is very important for the economic life of 
the community, so I want to make sure that it gets accomplished in a timely 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
Downey is planning a major expansion for the Stonewood shopping center, which 
is viewed as key to the city's efforts to modernize the Firestone Boulevard 
commercial corridor and increase its tax base. 
</P>
<P>
Caton has been Cudahy's city manager since 1982, injecting new life into the 
city's redevelopment projects, Mayor Tom Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
Caton revitalized redevelopment projects, including a $14-million shopping 
center and the community's first supermarket, Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish he wasn't going, but he would be a fool to pass up an opportunity like 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said he expected his City Council to name Jack Joseph, assistant city 
manager, acting city manager while officials search for a replacement for 
Caton. 
</P>
<P>
Caton said that in the last year and a half he has also been offered three 
other city manager jobs in the Southland: Hermosa Beach, Cathedral City and San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said that city officials knew that Caton "had been looking around" and 
that his council had included a $5,000 bonus in this year's budget "as sort of 
a carrot" to try to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
"But Downey made him an offer he couldn't refuse," Thurman added. 
</P>
<P>
Caton's seven-year stint at Cudahy was interrupted by an eight-month hiatus 
that began in September, 1985, when he resigned during a controversy over a the 
casino planned for the city. The casino is now being built and is projected to 
open at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"The main controversy was that the City Council wished to hire a finance 
director who would oversee the casino and had no background in local 
government," Caton said. Caton was rehired by the city in April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Several Degrees 
</P>
<P>
Caton was also assistant city manager for in Signal Hill for five years and 
assisted the planning department and the administration of federal and state 
grants for Garden Grove, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Caton has a degree in history from Cal State Long Beach and a master's degree 
from USC's School for Public Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Davis will step down after four years as city manager. He had also worked 27 
years with the city's Fire Department, eight as fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when he took the city manager's job, he told the council that he 
would stay for just four years. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has no definite retirement plans but may work with developers on 
projects, consult in the public sector or work on a family venture.

30 TO RUN FOR BOARD IN TROUBLED COMPTON DISTRICT

<P>
Thirty people have filed to run for election to the board of a Compton Unified 
School District that is facing growing teacher and parent discontent. 
</P>
<P>
Five seats on the seven-member board will be on the November ballot. Four of 
the positions carry four-year terms. The fifth seat, to fill an unexpired term, 
will be for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The district is losing about 128 of its teachers this year. Many are switching 
to the Los Angeles Unified School District, where teachers won a three-year, 
24% pay raise in the spring after a four-week strike, according to district 
teachers union officials. 
</P>
<P>
Compton parents at board meetings and other gatherings have expressed concern 
over the district's low student scores on state tests. The scores average in 
the first percentile on a scale of 1 to 100. School buildings are crumbling 
and, according to some parents, are unsafe. And the district's swelling Latino 
enrollment, which could exceed 50% this year, is resulting in more pressure 
from Latino residents for better bilingual services and an equal share of the 
district's jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the candidates are long-time incumbents seeking new four-year terms. 
They are John Steward, a deputy probation officer for Los Angeles County; 
Kelvin Filer, a Compton attorney; Sam Littleton, a medical social worker at 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, and Manuel Correa, a retired city 
police commander who is also the only elected Latino official in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth incumbent is Lynn Dymally, whose father is Rep. Mervyn Dymally 
(D-Compton). She was appointed to the board only last month to replace Bernice 
Woods, who was elected in June to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Some district residents were angry over the appointment, which was made without 
public notice. Critics also see it as an attempt by Dymally's father to grasp 
more political power in the city. The residents launched a petition drive to 
have the congressman's daughter removed but failed to gather the necessary 
number of signatures in time to meet last week's deadline. Organizers of the 
drive were attempting to force the school board to remove Dymally and leave the 
seat vacant until the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally has already served one term on the board, but in 1987 decided not to 
seek reelection. Known also by her married name of Lynn Dymally Lee, the 
congressman's daughter faces three challengers vying to serve the remaining two 
years of Woods' term. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Acquanetta Harrison Warren, 33, who tried two years ago to win a 
seat on the board. A product manager for First Interstate Bank, Warren and her 
husband have two children in the Compton schools. 
</P>
<P>
Also running is Kalem Aquil, a 41-year-old electronics technician with the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District who is making his first bid for 
public office. He has three children in the city schools and is a member of the 
district's advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth challenger to Dymally is Omar Bradley, 30, a high school English 
teacher in the Lynwood schools, who ran unsuccessfully for the City Council 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's sister-in-law, Paula L. Howard, is among the 26 candidates running 
for four-year terms. Howard, 36, is a physical education teacher in the Lynwood 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Also running for four-year terms are Margaret Moore, 58, a community liaison 
with the school district, who almost won a spot on the board when she was a 
candidate two years ago; Madelina D. Dewberry, a former teacher who is now 
manager of human resources at American Express' Culver City office, and 
47-year-old Earnest Spears, executive director of the Compton Chamber of 
Commerce. Spears ran unsuccessfully this year for city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Run for Board 
</P>
<P>
Gorgonio (Greg) Sanchez Jr., a quality control manager for a manufacturing 
company and a member of the city government's Latino Advisory Committee, is 
making his second run for the school board. He was an unsuccessful candidate in 
1985 but this year, he says, the Latino community is organizing a voter 
registration drive. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Sadie R. Benham, a child-care center teacher; Muhammad 
Abdullah, a student at Cal State Long Beach; Verda M. Cheathen, a teacher; Gary 
Leon Daniels, a minister and a teacher; Hyacinth Dandridge, an educator and 
community activist; Deborah M. Gayles, library assistant; Nancy L. Johnson, a 
retired teacher; Roy E. Little, a vocational rehabilitation counselor; and Saul 
E. Lankster, a former school board member who listed his occupation as educator 
and business administrator and operates a florist shop. 
</P>
<P>
Also running are Chester L. Hammond Sr.; youth services counselor; Dhanifu S. 
Karim, student and counselor; Malcum Mumford, a sheet-metal worker; Ken 
Perkins, who is self-employed; Otha Ray Scott, an educator; Mae Thomas, a 
community parent facilitator; Walter E. White Jr., a retired property manager; 
and Patricia Moore, who works for the city as a business license inspector. She 
is not related to the councilwoman of the same name.

On most days, being a cop in the Glendale Galleria means biding your time. 
</P>
<P>
In the sprawling city within a city that is one of Southern California's 
largest shopping malls, the typical bad guys are shoplifters, credit card 
hucksters and the occasional smooth-talking jewelry thief. Police officers 
patrolling the mall know that figuring out a crime has occurred is half the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
So when two robbery suspects tried to lose themselves in the mall last week 
after leading police from three departments on a 45-minute, high-speed chase 
from Long Beach, the chain of events they set off was more than a bit unusual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Routine Patrol Interrupted 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Officers Stephan Poulter and William Maupin were walking their 
routine patrol in the mall when an excited man approached them Aug. 9, alerting 
them that two men were wandering the mall carrying a large plastic trash bag. 
The bag, the man said, was filled with cash. 
</P>
<P>
When Poulter and Maupin caught up to the pair, the men took off at a run and 
the officers dashed after them. Poulter, a marathon runner, caught one suspect 
as he tried to slip out a mall entrance. He pushed the suspect to the ground 
and drew his baton, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspect, standing behind Poulter, drew a .38-caliber pistol, pushed 
it against Poulter's ribs and ordered Poulter to freeze, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
With a reaction he later said was almost purely reflex, Poulter knocked the 
pistol out of the suspect's hands as Maupin rushed in and helped Poulter 
apprehend both men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robbery Suspects 
</P>
<P>
The officers arrested Michael Bourne, 21, of Long Beach and Miguel Gigliano, 
21, of Alhambra, on suspicion of committing a robbery in Long Beach. Poulter 
and Maupin said they were unaware that outside, helicopters were circling, 
police and sheriff's cars had surrounded the mall and a crowd of 300 had 
gathered. 
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday was the Super Bowl here," Poulter said. "We didn't know we were 
invited to play." 
</P>
<P>
The high-profile arrest has thrown a spotlight this week on the seven-person 
Glendale Police Department substation in the Glendale Galleria. But usually, 
the police who patrol the Galleria work more quietly, tracking crimes they say 
are intriguing but hardly the stuff of police drama. 
</P>
<P>
"By its very nature, retail crime is hard to identify because it looks 
innocent," said Sgt. Mark Distaso, the station's commander. "Nobody's getting 
beaten up, nobody's getting held up with a gun, there's no purse snatched, but 
that credit card that's just been used to buy $1,000 worth of stuff might not 
be good. You just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The substation, established in 1982, was the first permanent police station in 
a mall in Southern California. The station, a small wood-paneled office near a 
mall entrance, has a small-town sheriff's station feel. And the officers 
assigned there say they function as the police force for a small, enclosed 
city, where making people feel safe is almost as important as actually catching 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
120 Arrests a Month 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say the substation is not busy. The police in the mall make 
about 120 arrests a month, and shopping center thefts total between $7 million 
and $14 million annually, said Distaso, who has been in charge of the 
substation for 18 months. With an average of 16,000 people visiting the 
Galleria's 169 stores daily, at least a few end up being booked at the 
substation and held in its cells each week, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the police substation, the Galleria maintains its own security 
force. But the mall's security officers are not armed and do not have arrest 
powers. Security officers patrol parking structures to watch for car break-ins 
and walk the corridors of the mall to discourage shoplifting, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donated Space 
</P>
<P>
The Galleria substation operates on a $500,000 yearly budget. The mall's owners 
donated the office space and designed and furnished the station. The Glendale 
Police Department built three temporary holding cells and supplied the station 
with office equipment, including sophisticated computers used to track criminal 
records of suspects almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the time, police in the Galleria investigate misdemeanors. The 
Glendale Galleria is one of the safest malls in the Los Angeles area, Distaso 
said. So far this year, only two people have been arrested there on suspicion 
of robbery. No one has ever been murdered in the mall and aggravated assaults 
are rare, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of violent crime, police who work in the Galleria spend much of 
their time fielding questions from lost shoppers and concerned shopkeepers, 
running crime prevention seminars for store owners, and roaming the mall's 30 
acres in plainclothes and in uniform watching for suspicious people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
The substation had its genesis in discussions eight years ago between the 
Galleria management and the city of Glendale, said Sgt. Dean Durand, the 
substation's first commanding officer who is now the spokesman for the Glendale 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants in the Galleria requested a stronger police presence in the mall, but 
Distaso said that was almost impossible to provide without a permanent office 
in the mall itself. By the time Glendale police responded to a call from inside 
the Galleria, parked and found the store they were looking for, suspected 
criminals were invariably long gone, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the average response time to crimes in the Galleria now is 30 
seconds, Distaso said. "You're not going to beat that anywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the small crimes that are a part of Galleria life are found to be 
part of a larger pattern. 
</P>
<P>
For example, three men were arrested last year on suspicion of retail burglary 
after they stole $2,600 in clothing from a Galleria store. The thieves were 
part of a Colombian ring that had been under investigation by a Los Angeles 
Police Department task force for months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Men Followed to Freeway 
</P>
<P>
In October, a plainclothes officer noticed two suspicious-acting men browsing 
in a jewelry store. The officers did not see the men commit a crime, but, 
acting on a hunch, officers from the substation followed the men until they got 
on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the jewelry store's manager reported that $13,000 worth of 
jewelry was missing. Using information and descriptions gathered during the 
previous day's surveillance, Glendale police sent squad cars to the same 
freeway on-ramp used by the men. The suspects took the same route they had 
taken the day before. Now they are in state prison serving sentences for 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Mall crime, at times, is "like putting your hand into a black hole," Poulter 
said. "You have no idea how far you'll go. You may arrest the guy for petty 
theft, and it turns out the guy is wanted for murder in Wisconsin. We run into 
a very sophisticated type of criminal here." 
</P>
<P>
Police encountered just such a criminal one recent Friday, when the Disney 
Store reported that a customer had left the store wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt 
that clerks were sure he was stealing. 
</P>
<P>
Working from the substation, Distaso used a hand-held radio to dispatch a 
plainclothes officer to follow the man and a uniformed officer to back up the 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Murmuring into radios in clipped, excited voices that at times seemed almost 
silly, the officers kept in contact while the man wandered in and out of 
several stores. The police officers followed the man up escalators and down an 
elevator as Distaso fired questions at Disney Store clerks over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strings Hanging Out' 
</P>
<P>
"His shirt is newly creased. I can see the strings hanging out," came the voice 
of the plainclothes detective over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"He's at the sale rack. He's picking up a pair of shoes," came another voice in 
a conspiratorial tone worthy of James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
When the man reached his car, police officers appeared suddenly as Distaso 
questioned him about the shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The attention to the shoplifter seemed almost comical -- until police started 
asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
The man's driver's license was suspended. He was carrying plane tickets to 
Medallin, Colombia, a drug-trade hot spot. A search of his car found two other 
driver's licenses, both with the man's picture, but bearing different names. A 
beeper inside the glove compartment was keyed to multiple phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Distaso called the Glendale Police Department's narcotics squad. They knew the 
man. They had found a kilo of cocaine in his house last year. 
</P>

BELLFLOWER COUNCIL SPLIT ON ACTION, 3-2; 
</P>
<P>
LOW-DENSITY ORDINANCE DELAYED FOR STREET STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BELLFLOWER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has put off voting on an ordinance that would reduce density 
in multiple-family residential areas while officials study a proposal to widen 
some streets in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 Monday night to delay the final vote on the ordinance 
until Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the ordinance would automatically end Bellflower's two-month-old 
moratorium on new development in multiple-family residential areas, City Atty. 
Maurice O'Shea said. The moratorium was approved by the council on June 12 for 
a 45-day period, but last month was extended to one year, assistant planner 
Bruce Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance is approved, Leach said it would be the first zoning reduction 
in Bellflower history. This is the first real evaluation of density, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," said Councilman Bill Pendleton, who voted against the 
postponement. "All we did is spin our wheels and waste time. What does the 
widening of streets have to do with density and parking?" 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance calls for a reduction of up to four units per acre in 
medium- and high-density residential zones throughout the city. The current 
medium-density standards of eight to 17 units per acre would be revised to 
eight to 13 units per acre. High-density standards of 18 to 25 units per acre 
would be changed to 14 to 22 units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also would require one additional parking spot per bedroom for 
units of three or more bedrooms. These units also must provide half of one 
parking space for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joseph Cvetko, who made the motion to postpone voting, said the 
ordinance does not address the widening of narrow streets in multifamily 
residential areas. If the ordinance is approved, he said, the moratorium would 
be repealed and developers would start building before street-widening costs 
were studied. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to bite the bullet," Cvetko said. "We can hold a second reading to 
give us time not to kill the moratorium at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Oliva, deputy city administrator, said widening some of the streets 
including Rose, Cedar and Ramona streets, could cost as much as $1 million per 
block because of the length of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Leach said many of the residential blocks are close to half a mile in length. A 
typical block, he said, is about a third of that length. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Bellflower's moratorium is still in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Leach said that when the moratorium began, four projects were put on hold. 
Since then, about 20 other projects have been proposed, Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Boggs, a developer with Boggs Realty Co. in Bellflower, said she 
favors the ordinance and taking the extra two weeks to study street-widening 
costs and sources of funding. "The purpose of the moratorium was to discuss 
density," she said. "This does not impede development and I think they are 
moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
If street widening or any other addition to the ordinance is made, the 
ordinance must be resubmitted to the Planning Commission, City Atty. O'Shea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of this delay irritated Pendleton, who said some city officials 
are afraid of rapid development in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is growth, and growth won't go away," he said. "To adopt slow growth 
is just to shove it in someone else's back yard. Progress keeps happening."

ELECTORATE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ESTABLISH POLICE REVIEW PANEL

<P>
Voters next spring will decide whether to establish a citizen commission that 
would for the first time give the public the power to investigate complaints of 
police brutality and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week voted 5 to 3 to place the proposal for a Citizen 
Police Complaint Commission on next April's ballot, capping more than six 
months of effort by a coalition of activists. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the split council vote, supporters predicted that the commission would 
win widespread popular support. "I think the community will be a completely 
different story," said Frank Berry of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People, one of a number of organizations backing the commission 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents said they will soon meet to plan a campaign to win approval of the 
commission, which requires a change in the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 11-member review board, appointed by the mayor and the council, 
would have the authority to investigate complaints, the city administration 
would retain key powers. The city manager rather than the commission would 
appoint the commission's independent investigator, and it would be up to the 
police chief rather than the commission to actually discipline police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also contains a provision directing the City Council to evaluate 
the commission after it has been in existence for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of giving residents a say in misconduct investigations has been 
discussed for years in Long Beach. But it was not until a white Long Beach 
police officer was secretly videotaped in an encounter with a black police 
activist last January that the proposal picked up sufficient political backing 
to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
On that tape, filmed by a TV crew and broadcast on national television, Officer 
Mark Dickey appeared to shove activist Don Jackson into a plate-glass window 
after pulling Jackson's car over for a routine traffic stop. Jackson, a former 
Hawthorne police officer, had gone to Long Beach with the film crew to try to 
prove longstanding allegations of police mistreatment of minorities in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and his partner have since gone on stress-related leave and are awaiting 
trial on misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from the episode. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Shoag, who as a member of the city's Public Safety Advisory Commission 
has crusaded for a review board, said that without the Jackson incident, the 
commission proposal never would have gotten a place on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Council proponents of the commission idea argue that it is necessary to restore 
trust in the Police Department, while opponents contend that it robs the 
council and the police administration of accountability. 
</P>
<P>
The police administration earlier indicated it would prefer not to have a 
citizen review board, but Assistant Chief Gene Brizzolara said the department 
will not oppose the ballot item. "If the citizens feel that it is warranted, 
they should go forward and vote in a police commission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Long Beach's powerful police union have in the past said they will 
support a citizen commission, but they have not appeared at any council 
meetings to reaffirm their position. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Clarence Smith, Evan Anderson Braude, Ray Grabinski, Tom Clark and 
Wallace Edgerton voted to place the matter on the ballot. Council members Jan 
Hall, Les Robbins and Jeffrey A. Kellogg voted no. Although Councilman Warren 
Harwood attended Tuesday's council meeting, he was absent for the vote, 
prompting criticism from the commission's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"He avoided the vote. It was very obvious," asserted Sid Solomon of Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved, a citywide political group. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood later said his absence was unintentional, explaining that he had to 
leave to make some telephone calls on council business. He added that his 
absence "in no way represented any kind of opinion. I voted for this all the 
way through."

PAY RAISES OF 10% TO 17% PROPOSED FOR TOP OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing the thorny issue of pay raises for the city's top officials, a Long 
Beach City Council committee has recommended salary increases ranging from 10% 
to 17% for the city manager, city attorney, city prosecutor, city auditor and 
city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed salary increases, which must be voted on by the full council, are 
smaller than those suggested by a private consultant hired to review the 
officials' salaries. But committee members argued that the Hay Group's 
recommendations were too heavily influenced by comparisons with private 
corporate salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, all but the city manager's salary would jump between 10% 
and 17% both this year and next. The city manager, who has the highest salary, 
would get 11% more this year and an undecided raise next year. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city manager earns $118,200, the city attorney $99,800, the city 
prosecutor $92,000, the city auditor $84,400, and the city clerk $52,700.

DRUG-DEALING TENANTS TO BE EVICTED UNDER NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tenants involved in drug dealings can be evicted by their landlords under an 
ordinance adopted unanimously Monday by the Artesia City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A landlord can evict a tenant if it is determined that the tenant is involved 
in illegal drug activities, including possession or sale of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just trying to give the landlord a tool to stop drug dealing," 
Councilman Ronald H. Oliver said. He said the council acted after a landlord 
asked for help in evicting a tenant allegedly involved in drug activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether this works, we don't know. But we should do something other than 
slapping their hands," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords who are aware of the activities and fail to evict tenants, can be 
fined up to $5,000 under the ordinance.

COUNCIL TO REVIEW ITS 'SAFE AND SANE' FIREWORKS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fireworks are on the agenda tonight for the Cerritos City Council, which is 
scheduled to discuss its "safe and sane" policy for sale and use of the Fourth 
of July delights. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to take a look at its policy after a home caught fire this 
year when a holiday rocket sent embers onto the wood roof, causing a fire that 
did $100,000 worth of damage, said Kurt C. Swanson, director of human affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos allows various service organizations such as the Optimist Club, Little 
League, high school booster clubs and the Veterans of Foreign Wars to sell 
fireworks. Swanson said he does not believe the council is thinking about 
banning fireworks but, rather, wants to assess their impact on the city. 
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, according to a report prepared by Swanson and his 
staff, property loss in the city due to fireworks-related fires totaled 
$187,000. There have been no injuries attributed to fireworks in recent years. 
The report also says that the greatest impact if the novelties are banned would 
be to the service organizations that depend on the once-a-year revenue.

27-MEMBER COMMITTEE ON RACE RELATIONS TO BE NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lynwood City Council has approved the establishment of a 27-member 
committee on race relations and selected two councilmen to serve on it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Paul H. Richards, who first suggested the committee for the 
predominantly Latino and black community of 50,000, was chosen as chairman. 
Councilman Louis J. Heine was also chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five other members are expected to be selected by Sept. 5. They will 
come from a cross section of the community and will include representatives 
from businesses, churches and schools. The committee will also include young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of (the) special committee to review the status of race 
relations in Lynwood is a critical step in preserving this great community," 
Richards said in a prepared statement. The group will identify problems and 
recommend solutions, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Black City Council members said they have been accused of racism after they 
voted to rename a major boulevard after Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the decision to rename Century Boulevard after the slain civil 
rights leader was made according to proper governmental procedure. He said the 
five-member council, made up of three blacks and two whites, was unanimous in 
its decision to honor King by renaming the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In April, after the council voted 3 to 2 to rename the boulevard, a number of 
residents protested the decision. Recall petitions against two of the 
councilmen were rejected by the city clerk because they were not properly 
filled out.

DNA EVIDENCE RULING BOOSTS BILL TO HAVE GENETIC DATA BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State legislation that would establish a genetic data bank to track violent 
criminals received a boost last week when a Ventura judge ruled that DNA 
"fingerprinting" evidence is admissible in court. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), was approved 
by the Senate on June 27 and will go before an Assembly subcommittee next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're able to quote from the judge's findings. That definitely doesn't hurt," 
said Yvonne Campos, a spokeswoman for Hart. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require those convicted of violent crimes to submit 
samples that contain DNA, such as blood and saliva, prior to their release from 
correctional facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Sex offenders are already subject to this requirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labs to Be Set Up 
</P>
<P>
The bill would appropriate $3 million to set up a central DNA laboratory in 
conjunction with UC Berkeley and regional laboratories in Los Angeles, Orange 
and San Diego counties and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Samples taken from criminals would be analyzed for their DNA content, with the 
information placed in a computer to provide a unique biological profile of each 
felon. The DNA profile could then be matched with blood, semen or other tissue 
at crime scenes, allowing law enforcement agencies to identify suspects even in 
the absence of fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate approved the bill 37 to 0, civil liberties activists have 
sounded a cautionary note about the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fundamental concerns with respect to privacy, how the information is 
stored and who has access to it," said Francisco Lobaco, a legal advocate for 
the American Civil Liberties Union in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU also questioned using a technology that has not yet been upheld by an 
appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scientific Disputes 
</P>
<P>
"Before the state goes out and spends millions of dollars, we should make sure 
it's reliable. There continue to be scientific disputes," Lobaco said. 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark decision, Ventura Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch last week 
ruled that genetic fingerprinting is admissible as evidence in a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Ventura ruling does not set a legal precedent, it will be cited by 
law enforcement officials throughout the state to bolster murder cases, Ventura 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Storch heard technical testimony from 11 experts, including molecular 
biologists from Yale and Stanford universities. The Ventura County district 
attorney's office spent 18 months preparing for the case to lay a foundation so 
that the admissibility of DNA will be unassailable on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic fingerprinting was developed four years ago in England and is already 
admissible as evidence in 18 states. Law enforcement officials say the chance 
of two people having the same DNA pattern is less than one in a billion. 
</P>
<P>
The DNA ruling was the first step in a murder trial against Lynda Axell, 33, of 
Ventura, who is charged with stabbing 63-year-old George White to death last 
year at a Ventura hamburger stand. 
</P>
<P>
That trial will resume Monday.

GLENDALE COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS A 3RD DOWNZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday to the third 
proposal in three weeks by resident groups requesting zoning changes that would 
forbid apartment construction in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to set public hearings for a group of 10 homeowners wanting 
to turn 18 multifamily-zoned properties in the 300 and 400 blocks of Mission 
Road into single-family lots. 
</P>
<P>
"The residential neighborhood's topography is hilly; most land parcels are 
small, and the streets are ill-equipped to accommodate the increased parking 
and traffic demands," City Planning Director John McKenna said in support of 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The council is encouraging voluntary downzoning of neighborhoods from apartment 
to single-family zoning to deal with the city's population explosion.

SHEFF KEEPS HIS DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legend has it some hulking brute was bashing the dimples out of the golf ball 
in the Oakmont Country Club member/guest tournament in June. This ape was 
reaching the green of the 486-yard, par-five first hole using a crushing driver 
and a lofting six iron. 
</P>
<P>
Legend, as is often the case, was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
First, the player in question was Dave Sheff of La Canada, a guy with an 
average build and a disposition as gentle as a three-foot putt. Second, Sheff 
was teeing off with a three wood, not a driver. 
</P>
<P>
"(The onlookers) kind of shook their heads and laughed," recalled Sheff while 
nursing a soft drink in the Oakmont clubhouse grill. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sheff's choice of golf clubs might have raised some eyebrows at the 
tournament, it came as no surprise to many club members. Sheff, 40, the club's 
former assistant pro and now a Ping club salesman, has built quite a reputation 
for belting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sheff and friend Mike Haney, a Glendale fire captain, placed third 
in the Santa Barbara Classic. They won the tournament last year when Sheff 
birdied three of four holes in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Haney has known Sheff for about 15 years, he still marvels at his 
power. Once, while playing in the MacBeth Invitational at the Wilshire Country 
Club, Sheff was about 240 yards from the middle of the green. He turned to 
Haney for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'Hey partner, what do you think? Four iron?' " said Haney, 38, an 
All-American at USC in 1973. "I'm thinking, 'How the hell do you club a guy 
that hits a four iron that far?' I said to him, 'Don't you think it's a three?' 
And he hits a four 20 feet away from the hole and is putting for eagle." 
</P>
<P>
Sheff's long game is no tall tale. His drives are so powerful, some might think 
that he's playing with helium-filled Titleists. His drives frequently sail more 
than 300 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Friends call him "Wedgie," a moniker he earned during his two-year stint on the 
pro tour in the early 1970's. Sheff says he got the name for his lack of a 
short game -- not, as some Oakmont players believe, because his second shot is 
usually with a pitching wedge. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the reason I had to get my amateur status back was because my wedge 
game wasn't as good as it should have been," Sheff said. "My wedge used to be 
the worst shot in my bag, but through the years I've gotten much better at it. 
Let's say I'm a plus-two handicap hitting the ball. I feel like I'm still an 
eight handicap around the greens." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Sheff's game was self-taught. He was raised in Reno and began playing 
in his early teens. He entered Arizona State in 1967 as a walk-on, but was 
given a full scholarship after he won a freshman tournament that included 
powerhouse golf schools such as Houston and Wake Forest. He was an honorable 
mention All-American as a senior and finished 10th in the 1971 NCAA 
championship. He also won the 1971 NCAA long-drive competition with a 342-yard 
wallop. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff graduated and played on the pro tour as a "rabbit" for two years. A 
rabbit is a player who has to qualify for tournaments on a weekly basis. He 
quickly tired of living on a shoestring budget and saw little hope of reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you really want to give the tour a good shot, you have to play five 
years," he said. "I hit the ball as well as anybody out there. I just wasn't as 
good a putter and chipper, you know, bunker player and things like that. So I 
just didn't think I had a good enough game to continue playing on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he loves uncorking a screaming drive, but having a towering tee shot is 
not so appealing, Sheff says, when he loses a little touch. 
</P>
<P>
"What keeps me up nights is when I try to fade the ball and it hooks," he said. 
"That's the shot that drives me crazy. Here you're aiming left, you've got the 
club face open so you think it's going to go to the right. So you take this big 
swing and it starts left and even goes further left. You're usually about 60 
yards off-line instead of right down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
The key to beating Sheff, according to Oakmont assistant Mark Spinelli, is 
catching him on a day when his shots are hooking. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get him when he's hitting the ball straight, breaking par is no 
problem," Spinelli said. "But he would listen to 36-handicapper if he could 
cure that hook." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, Sheff has quite a few 36-handicappers listening to him. He spends 
most of his time traveling to courses between Los Angeles and Fresno, 
convincing golfers of all abilities to purchase a set of clubs. He is so busy, 
in fact, he has surprisingly little time to play. That makes house calls to 
spectacular courses particularly tough. 
</P>
<P>
"You call in Bel Air and Riviera and L. A. Country Club and you think, 'Geez, 
it would be nice to put the briefcase away and play a few holes,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But don't pity Sheff. His deep tan and casual work clothes suggest he gets in 
enough golf to keep his swing fresh. 
</P>
<P>
So fresh, he has to angle his drives on the Oakmont driving range so as not to 
hit the parking lot that is far out of the reach of most players' drives. 
Still, he shys away from long-driving contests. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sheff: "Now you show up to these things and you're going up against guys 
that are 6-foot-8, 240 (pounds), with drivers that are five inches over length. 
So it's really turned into a home run derby. If they catch one, there's no 
chance to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
One select fraternity wears "350 Club" T-shirts and is composed of players who 
have unleashed at least a 350-yarder in competition. "You hear horror stories 
about drives anywhere between 350 and 420 yards with these guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Or so legend has it.

VENTURA MAYOR WILL SEEK 4TH TERM ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Mayor James L. Monahan has announced that he will run for reelection in 
the Nov. 7 race for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, 54, said he is seeking his fourth term in office because he wants to 
continue planning for Ventura's future. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things that I've been working on with the council are not yet 
completed," Monahan said, adding that he has received "literally hundreds of 
calls urging me to run." 
</P>
<P>
Monahan cited the Cal State Ventura campus, completion of the redevelopment 
plan for the County Fairgrounds, importation of water, and traffic circulation 
as problems he wants to address in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lack of a community center "has been a big pet peeve of mine 
for the last 12 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and the vice mayor are elected by the council for two-year terms. 
Monahan, whose term as mayor is ending, will serve as a councilman if he is 
reelected this fall. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, 16 people had filed papers for four available seats, said 
Ventura City Clerk Barbara Kam. The deadline for filing was Wednesday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Monahan, incumbent Nan Drake is also running for reelection. 
Councilmen John Sullard and William Crew, whose terms expire this fall, have 
announced that they will not run again. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Council members are elected at large for four-year terms.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO PASS S&amp;L BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 201 to 175, the House sent to President Bush legislation (HR 1278) 
designed to bail the thrift industry and the federal government out of the 
financial calamity caused by thecollapse of hundreds of savings and loans in 
the 1980s. The Senate had passed the bill on a non-record vote. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the S&amp;L salvage will be for the government to borrow $50 
billion primarily for closing or merging troubled thrifts and meeting federal 
reimbursement obligations to those who lost billions in U.S.-insured deposits. 
About $20 billion will be incurred by Treasury borrowing and included in the 
fiscal 1989 budget. The remaining $30 billion will be borrowed by a new 
government-chartered corporation but will not be counted on the budget nor 
tallied as part of the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
Although the thrift industry will have to repay the $50 billion principal, 
taxpayers will be required to pay borrowing costs. Conservative estimates are 
that the total bailout will cost at least $160 billion, including debt service 
over 30 years with the average taxpayer supplying $1,000 of the amount. Other 
estimates double those projected costs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Chalmers Wylie (R-Ohio) said: "We are not bailing out S&amp;Ls. We 
are not bailing out their stockholders or their managers. We are delivering on 
our promise that the federal government stands behind the safety and the life 
savings of millions of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) said the rescue "should have been paid for by 
taxes, current taxes, a very small tax, but the President could not bring 
himself to say the word. So we have foisted on our children and grandchildren 
an unconscionable debt of perhaps $100 to $200 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Violence, TV and Antitrust 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 399 to 18, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1391) providing 
an antitrust exemption to enable competing television industry executives to 
meet to discuss ways of making their programs less violent. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the bill would "remove the perception, 
apparently held by many in the television industry, that the antitrust laws are 
a possible impediment" to less violent programming. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Don Edwards D-San Jose) said: "I have never seen an exemption to the 
antitrust laws that worked for the benefit of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the antitrust exemption.

KINGDOM SETS RECORD IN HURDLES; 
</P>
<P>
HIS 12.92 AT ZURICH TOPS WORLD MARK BY NEHEMIAH IN '81 
</P>

<P>
Roger Kingdom eclipsed the mark he thought would be so difficult to reach, 
setting a world record in the 110-meter high hurdles with a time of 12.92 
seconds Wednesday during a track and field meet at Zurich, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, a two-time Olympic champion, broke Renaldo Nehemiah's mark set on the 
same track on Aug. 19, 1981, by one-hundredth of a second. Nehemiah had been 
scheduled to compete Wednesday but withdrew in a disagreement over appearance 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it would happen, but I'm glad it did," Kingdom told reporters 
in Zurich. "I'm glad I put the start together with the finish. I was second or 
third out of the blocks, and after the third hurdle, I made sure no one caught 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kingdom had a quick start on the hot evening at the Weltklasse meet, 
he did not take a commanding lead until the eighth hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Colin Jackson, the silver medalist in last year's Seoul Olympics, led 
early but finished second in 13.12, one-hundredth of a second off his European 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario's Tonie Campbell, the bronze medalist in the 1988 Games, was third in 
13.23. Two-time world champion Greg Foster of Chino Hills finished fifth in 
13.26, behind fellow American Jack Pierce in 13.24. Foster, who is coming back 
this season after breaking an arm a second time, hugged Kingdom after the race. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the toughest field I've ever faced," said Kingdom, 26, who leaped into 
the air after seeing his time. 
</P>
<P>
"Nehemiah was my idol. I followed him through high school and hated it when he 
went to play football." 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah, who watched the race, said in a telephone interview from Zurich: "I 
didn't take my record being broken as hard as I thought I would. I'm very happy 
for Roger. He is the best hurdler in the world. It's only fitting he should 
have it all at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah, who became a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers before 
returning to track in 1986, said he is happy with his performances this season 
and decided to skip the meet when promoter Andreas Brugger offered him $4,000 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah said Kingdom was offered $5,000, plus bonuses. Shortly before the 
race, promoters offered Nehemiah $5,000 but without a bonus incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand the logic behind it," Nehemiah said. "They offered me 
$4,000 last year and I wasn't running nearly as fast as this year. I considered 
it an insult." 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah also said he was protesting the lack of respect his event receives, 
saying hurdlers should earn as much as 100-meter sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
"How fast does a hurdler have to run to command that mutual respect across the 
board?" he asked. "It really doesn't matter how fast we run. There isn't a 
whole lot of respect for hurdle events in track and field today. I had to take 
a stand." 
</P>
<P>
Brugger could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who finished fifth with a time of 13.51 when Nehemiah set the record 
in 1981, said that Wednesday's race was much more difficult than the one eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible race," he said by phone. "Roger ran a perfect race for 
him. He didn't hit many hurdles. He got a great start. He was right up there 
with us from the very first hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no wind . . . the conditions were perfect. But the track was not as 
fast as it could have been; it was a mushy track. We didn't just happen to luck 
upon a fast track. It was a great effort by all." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he was too busy racing to watch the record being set, as he had 
in 1981 when Nehemiah took control from the start and left the competition 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said Kingdom did not have the race won until the eighth hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there was no catching him at that point," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis and Butch Reynolds also had fine performances Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who beat world record-holder Ben Johnson of Canada at Zurich last year, 
won the 100 meters in 10.09, defeating fellow Americans Dennis Mitchell, who 
ran a 10.14; 1989 U.S. champion Leroy Burrell, 10.19, and Andre Cason, 10.19. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who broke the 20-year-old world record of 43.29 for the 400 meters in 
last year's meet, won in 44.31, slightly off this year's best of 44.27 by 
Antonio Pettigrew. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, the Olympic silver medalist, edged bronze medalist Danny Everett, who 
was timed in 44.36. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Paul Ereng, the Olympic 800-meter champion, won his event in 1:43.16, 
the fastest time in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, the only man to clear 8 feet in the high jump, was 
beaten by former world record-holder Patrik Sjoberg of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Sjoberg cleared 7 feet 8 3/4 inches, Sotomayor 7-8. Hollis Conway, the U.S. 
record-holder, finished third at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Guenthoer, the Olympic bronze medalist, out-dueled Randy Barnes of the 
United States, the silver medalist at the Seoul Games, in the shot put. 
Guenthoer won with a put of 71-7 1/2 to Barnes' 71-2 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Sebastian Coe, running his last race at Zurich 
before retiring, was second in the 1,500 meters in 3:34.05, behind Wilfred 
Kirochi of Kenya (3:33.85). 
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion John Ngugi of Kenya finished third in the 5,000 meters in 
13:25.50, as Morocco's Said Aouita, the world record-holder, won in 13:24.45 
and Portugal's Domingo Castro was second in 13:25.08.

ANATOMY OF A BAD BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
BONE IN DRAVECKY'S LEFT ARM WAS WEAKENED BY OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
His first comeback has been called a miracle. Will there be a second miracle 
for Dave Dravecky? 
</P>
<P>
That's what some orthopedic specialists and other doctors think the 33-year-old 
left-hander for the San Francisco Giants will need to return to the mound, 
after suffering a broken bone in his throwing arm Tuesday night in a game at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
That was the fifth time that Dravecky had pitched since his seemingly 
impossible return to baseball after recovering from a rare form of muscle 
cancer, which nearly destroyed his pitching arm last year. But it was only his 
second start since rejoining the Giants last week after a rehabilitation stint 
in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
After the operation last fall, doctors gave him virtually no hope of ever 
playing ball again, except maybe with his kids in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander was warned that the particular type of operation required to 
remove the cancerous tumor would render his arm fragile and susceptible to 
fracture. But he came back anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dravecky has entered something of a medical no-man's-land. 
</P>
<P>
"We're basically in uncharted territory here," said Robert Chandler, an 
orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky is certainly not the first major league player to come back from a 
severe arm injury. One of the most famous cases involved Ted Williams, the 
Boston Red Sox star who suffered a shattered elbow in the 1950 All-Star game 
and made it back to the playing field. Another medical miracle involved the 
rebuilding of Tommy John's pitching arm. 
</P>
<P>
But few pitchers have ever had serious fractures in their pitching arms, and 
the Giants seem to have a disproportionate share of them. Terry Mulholland, 
another San Francisco pitcher, was put on the 60-day disabled list last August 
when his left forearm was broken by a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
There are few cases of major league pitchers making comebacks from broken arms, 
simply because so few suffer fractures in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Major league pitchers simply don't break their arms," said Chandler, a surgeon 
at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic in Inglewood, one of the country's leading 
sports-medicine facilities. "Guys come in all the time with broken arms they 
get playing ball in the back yard. But major league pitchers don't. Their bones 
are too well-conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
When doctors discovered that Dravecky had cancer, they warned him that he had 
little, if any, chance of resuming a career in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was not the cancer alone, but the operation as well. 
</P>
<P>
The form of cancer that struck Dravecky in the biceps of his pitching arm was a 
malignancy known as a "desmoid tumor" or "aggressive fibromatosis." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, according to physicians, it is a nearly benign form of cancer called 
a "low-grade malignant tumor," which typically does not metastasize -- spread 
to other parts of the body -- but in many instances, somewhere between 30% and 
70% of cases, recurs in the spot where it developed. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky returned to his home state, Ohio, for the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
There, a Cleveland orthopedic cancer surgeon in one of the state's largest and 
most highly respected medical practices set about removing the growth, which 
had grown to about half the size of a golf ball, only months after Dravecky and 
his wife had noticed it. They had assumed it was scar tissue left over from 
earlier surgery to correct arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
According to Donald Morton, a UCLA surgeon and cancer specialist, the typical 
surgery involves removing the cancer, along with some of the surrounding muscle 
tissue and even a portion of the adjoining bone. The missing bone is then 
replaced with a type of cement. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dr. George F. Muschler of the Cleveland Clinic removed some muscle 
tissue surgically, he did not cut out any bone. Rather, in a seven-hour 
operation, he used cryosurgery, a method of freezing malignant tissue so that 
it is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Muschler said, he had to freeze enough bone tissue adjacent to the 
muscle, destroying some cells, that the bone itself would surely be somewhat 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
Muschler said he had discussed the matter with Dravecky, warning the pitcher 
that for at least two years after the operation last Oct. 7, the bone would be 
susceptible to fracture. 
</P>
<P>
But in some ways Muschler thought that was the least of the pitcher's worries, 
for half of the deltoid muscle had been removed from the biceps, slightly below 
the shoulder. And that is a key muscle in lowering the arm, a motion that no 
pitcher can live without. 
</P>
<P>
Though many fans were stunned by Dravecky's latest injury, his physicians were 
relieved that it was no worse than it was. 
</P>
<P>
The worst experts had envisioned when they saw the ballplayer slump to the 
ground on the pitcher's mound Tuesday night was a career-ending tear of the 
shoulder muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to understate the seriousness of this," said Gordon Campbell of 
Palo Alto, a team physician for the Giants. "It's bad. But I know Dave and I 
know the condition of his arm, and the two are compatible with returning next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the early prognosis was that he would be able to begin rehabilitation 
again in six weeks, with the humerus bone in the upper arm healing fully early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press news conference if he thought he could pitch in the majors 
again, Dravecky, his arm in a padded sling, responded, said, "Only God can 
answer that question. But I hope so."

JIM MURRAY: THE DIARY OF A MADCAP MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1949, when the Yankees signed Casey Stengel as manager, the New York writers 
were apoplectic. "That clown!" they wrote. "How dare they? There goes the 
neighborhood!" 
</P>
<P>
The statue of Babe Ruth would crack. Yankee Stadium would become a ghost town. 
A dynasty was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The popular belief was, Casey was just a baggy-pants comedian who would turn 
Yankee Stadium from the Old Vic into Minsky's, turn the Yankees from Hamlet 
into the Ziegfeld Follies. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he was a guy most famous for wearing a bird in his hat or dropping a 
grapefruit from the cockpit of a low-flying plane to his catcher below. 
Thumbing his nose at Babe Ruth as he ran out his inside-the-park home run in 
the 1923 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't take Casey seriously. He had stepped right out of the pages of a 
Grimm's fairy tale. He wasn't real. He was a figment of his own imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball has always been a game that liked its managers tight-lipped and 
humorless, somber martinets who would fine a smile, suspend a laugh and treat 
each loss like the fall of Paris. Remember the time Yogi Berra, no less, fined 
and benched Phil Linz for having the lightheartedness to play a harmonica on 
the team bus during a losing streak? 
</P>
<P>
Casey, they thought, was just a guy who would play it for laughs. "Why don't 
they just get Emmett Kelly if they want a clown?" they asked. 
</P>
<P>
So, this putative Bozo became the most successful manager in the history of 
baseball -- 10 pennants in 12 years, seven World Series championships. He 
perfected the art of platooning, refined the role of relief pitching. Casey 
didn't change. He just won. 
</P>
<P>
When the California Angels signed up Doug Rader to manage this year, a lot of 
people reacted the way New York had in 1949. This guy had a reputation that 
made Casey Stengel look staid. 
</P>
<P>
The best guess was, there would be a lot of cayenne pepper in the sugar bowls, 
game shoes nailed to the floor, uniforms knotted together and ice cubes in the 
whirlpool bath. But not many pennants. Doug Rader had more of a reputation as a 
cut-up than a careerist. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the Angels needed, it was generally felt, was some guy coming 
into the clubhouse with a nose that lights up, a box of exploding cigars or a 
set of rubber ducks and frames with no glasses in them. These guys were 
lighthearted enough and had the record to prove it -- 29 games behind Oakland 
last year. These guys could get all the laughs they needed. 
</P>
<P>
What the Angels needed was somebody with a spiked-helmet mentality, someone who 
would march them into a swamp. The Angels do their best playing with somebody 
glaring at them, it was felt. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Doug Rader has been there almost a season now, and if you put a celluloid 
collar and striped tie on him and parted his hair in the middle, you'd think 
you had Connie Mack. Like Stengel, he proved to be a very serious man when it 
came to winning or losing. His team still trails Oakland. But they're 28 1/2 
games closer and, in fact, even take over the division lead from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
And a guy whose humor ran heavily to scatology and rabbit punches when he was a 
player, was revealed in a national magazine recently to be, of all things, a 
guy who keeps a diary. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Samuel Pepys and the girls in Louisa May Alcott novels keep diaries -- 
guys in granny glasses and girls in crinoline. But not big (6-foot-3), tough 
(he bites off bottle caps) ex-third-basemen. I mean, would John McGraw keep a 
diary? 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader does. "It's personal. But it's to keep tabs on myself." 
</P>
<P>
Rader sees it as a tool for self-improvement. "I like to look back (in the 
journal) and see how I handled a certain situation, whether it turned out 
positive or negative." 
</P>
<P>
It's not whether he bunted, or hit for the pitcher, it's what he did for 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
Such introspection might be found surprising by old teammates who remember 
Rader more as a guy who might leave elephant droppings in your game shoes than 
a guy who would go pouring his heart out in a locked book, but Doug Rader would 
probably wear a powdered wig if it would help win. Gene Mauch used to chart 
every ball everyone hit in colored pencil, but Rader clocks attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Rader is not a man who likes to see a player who has just popped up with the 
bases loaded or a pitcher who has just given up a game-winning walk sitting in 
his locker staring at the floor or sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
"Victory, you can exult over all winter," Rader says. "Failure, you should take 
off with your uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Brooding on failure, keeping it inside, only worsens the problem, perpetuates 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He would just as soon they get out the harmonica. It is no time for yelling. 
"Nobody needs to be reminded of his inadequacies," he insists. "Everyone knows 
too well what they are. Most people are very harsh on themselves already. They 
don't need you to add to it. They need you to emphasize the potential." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball deals in failure. The best team in the game loses one out of three. 
The best hitter in the game makes out two times out of three. And, people are, 
at bottom, insecure, Rader believes. "The trick is to instill confidence, not 
reinforce doubts," he reminds. "It's not the guy going three for 10 you have to 
work with, it's the guy going three for 30. Slumps are in the head." 
</P>
<P>
Winning is often a state of mind, too, Rader believes. The 1927 Yankees were 
great. But they were great because they thought they were. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Angels are not the '27 Yankees. But if they get in the World Series, 
look for baseball to comb the dugouts for guys with propellers on their caps, 
or a lapel flower that squirts water, guys who sat on candled cakes in the 
clubhouse or carried live birds around in their hats. 
</P>
<P>
These are serious people. It may be those boring glum types who sit there 
looking as if their feet hurt or they just got the news that the Titanic went 
down who may be the real clowns.

The Christian commander of Lebanon's army welcomed a U.N. call to halt 
increasingly fierce fighting in Lebanon, but there was no official word 
Wednesday from Syrian-backed Muslim forces, who have ringed Christian territory 
with guns and armor. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce shelling erupted Wednesday across the so-called Green Line that divides 
Beirut, Lebanon's capital, into Muslim and Christian sectors, after a short 
period of relative calm. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian gunners also shelled the Christian enclave north and east of Beirut, and 
the Christians responded by firing on residential areas of mostly Muslim West 
Beirut. Several apparently unoccupied apartment houses in the Muslim sector 
were set ablaze. Six people were wounded in Christian territory, police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire appeal was issued late Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council in 
New York. The resolution was approved during an emergency meeting called by 
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Christian commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said, "The 
general unconditionally welcomes the U.N. Security Council resolution." 
However, he added that the general views the resolution as a "package deal" -- 
meaning that Syrian forces besieging the Christian enclave would have to lift 
their blockade for the resolution to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from the gutted presidential palace at Baabda, Aoun 
affirmed that he welcomes the Security Council's statement but reserves for 
himself "the natural right for self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
Syria has not officially replied to the U.N. appeal, although President Hafez 
Assad, in a message to the Italian government released in Rome, promised to do 
his utmost "to silence the guns and promote, as far as possible, an 
inter-Lebanese agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Assad's letter, received Tuesday, was in response to a message sent Aug. 2 by 
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, according to an Italian official. 
</P>
<P>
Five months of artillery duels between the Syrians and the 20,000-member force 
headed by Aoun have killed more than 750 people and wounded more than 2,000, 
nearly all of them civilians. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution said, in part: "The Council . . . urgently appeals to all 
the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and 
shelling on land and sea." 
</P>
<P>
It also appealed for the parties "to do everything possible to secure the 
consolidation of the cease-fire, the opening of the lines of communication and 
the lifting of sieges." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Senseless Bloodshed' 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher read a statement that 
said, in part: "The senseless bloodshed . . . has gone on for far too long, and 
it must cease. We urge in the strongest terms that all parties abide by the 
council's call for a total and immediate cease-fire." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, whose offices have been repeatedly hit in the recent fighting, calls 
Syrian troops an occupation army and has declared a "war of liberation" to 
drive them out. Syria has about 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League 
peacekeeping mandate granted in 1976, the year after the sectarian civil war 
began. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Muslim security sources said the Muslim allies moved more tanks, 
troops and ammunition up to their positions along the 65-mile confrontation 
line with Aoun's outnumbered forces. 
</P>
<P>
One said the Syrians deployed Soviet-designed T-62 tanks on the northern and 
eastern flanks of the 310-square-mile Christian zone and that Druze chieftain 
Walid Jumblatt positioned scores of T-54 and T-55 tanks in the mountains to the 
south. The Christian area faces the Mediterranean on the west. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Druze Jeeps in West Beirut 
</P>
<P>
Druze fighters, seen manning jeep-mounted machine guns and recoilless cannons, 
were seen in West Beirut for the first time since Syrian troops moved into the 
Muslim sector in February, 1987, to stop factional war among militias. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese capital has taken the brunt of the battle. All but 150,000 of its 
1.5 million people have left since the shelling began in early March. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Lebanese Premier Salim Hoss, who is a Sunni Muslim, and Sunni religious 
leaders also embraced the U.N. truce appeal, which was broadcast by Beirut 
radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of all the suffering people, who are the majority of the population 
in Lebanon, I welcome the cease-fire," Hoss said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss added, however, that Aoun should end his "war of liberation" against Syria 
and that Syria's allies should end their blockade on the Christian enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss and Aoun lead competing Muslim and Christian Cabinets, formed during a 
government crisis in September, 1988, that also led to a split of the army into 
Christian and Muslim commands. 
</P>
<P>
The artillery war began two days after Aoun's forces blockaded illegal ports 
run by Muslim militias that deprived the government of about $100 million a 
year in customs revenue. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati returned to 
Tehran from Damascus after assuring Syria and its Lebanese allies of his 
country's support. Velayati met Lebanese and Muslim leftist leaders one by one 
at the Iranian Embassy in the Syrian capital after presiding over a session 
with various militia leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meetings With Militias 
</P>
<P>
Among the militia leaders who took part were Druze leader Jumblatt, Nabih Berri 
of the Shiite Muslim Amal militia and Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a Syrian-based Palestinian 
group that has been implicated in terrorist incidents. Also attending was 
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh. 
</P>
<P>
Cease-fires in Beirut seldom last, and few Lebanese appeared to believe that 
the U.N. resolution would have much impact unless the underlying political 
disputes are solved. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems we are heading for a new confrontation despite this cease-fire call; 
the militias are back," said Talal Hosseini, watching his janitor fill plastic 
bags with sand to fortify the entrance of his apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Adla Haroun, commented: "It is yet another call which will go 
down the drain. If U.N. resolutions were effective, all wars across the world 
would have ended by now."

STALKER JURY TOLD TO RESUME DELIBERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The judge in the Night Stalker murder trial ruled Wednesday that grieving 
jurors should renew their deliberations despite the weekend slaying of one 
member of the panel, prompting an obscene outburst from defendant Richard 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an objection," the shaggy-haired Night Stalker suspect blurted out from 
behind his black sunglasses. Still slouched in his chair, one arm draped over 
the back, Ramirez then uttered an obscenity to describe the court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's protest came after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan 
announced his decision to order a resumption of deliberations in the serial 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Present 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were not in the courtroom at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Later, outside court, Ray G. Clark, one of Ramirez's lawyers, said he and his 
client are concerned by the immediate resumption of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the quality of deliberations now, today, would be what it was a 
week ago. A cloud hangs over the jury now, a sadness," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury may be angry," he told reporters. "We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Clark had unsuccessfully sought a week's suspension in the deliberations -- "a 
small price to pay," he said -- to give jurors more time to overcome their 
grief over the murder of Phyllis Y. Singletary. 
</P>
<P>
After she failed to appear in court Monday morning, police found the 
30-year-old Pacific Bell employee Monday afternoon in her Carson apartment with 
two bullet wounds in her chest. Her boyfriend, James C. Melton, 51, shot 
himself in a Carson motel Tuesday morning as sheriff's deputies began closing 
in. Police said the murder-suicide was the result of a lovers' quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, Clark told reporters, "is concerned that the jury may not weigh the 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, they are hurting right now. And he's the only target they 
have," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the defense still intends to submit, within a day or two, a motion 
seeking a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's brief morning court session, Tynan and attorneys for both 
sides discussed the impact of Singletary's murder on the jury, publicly 
weighing several options as a packed courtroom listened raptly. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Tynan chose to interview jury foreman Felipe Rodgriguez, rather 
than all members of the jury as he had indicated he might do on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We can probably continue today," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he had arrived at this opinion after spending about an hour in 
the jury room with the other 11 jurors, including a woman who had wept and 
become immobilized after she was chosen randomly on Tuesday as Singletary's 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that it is somewhat tranquil," Rodriguez said, adding that none of the 
jurors said they felt unable emotionally to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone appears to have put it behind them," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
"All right. I'm delighted to hear that," Tynan said, sending Rodriguez back 
into the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Ramirez protested, resorting to an expletive for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Daniel V. Hernandez, Ramirez's chief defense lawyer, leaped to 
his feet, putting a hand on his client's shoulder and asking for a private 
conference with the judge and Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a chance," Tynan replied sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said it was insufficient to have heard from only one juror, albeit 
the foreman. 
</P>
<P>
"My client is concerned. I think that's obvious here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Halpin said he was relieved by the 
resumption of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to July 26," he said, citing the day when deliberations first began 
after six months of trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful that we followed the correct path," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the remaining 11 jurors and eight alternates were clearly upset as they 
reported to court Tuesday and were sent home by Tynan after a short court 
session. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, most of the jurors and alternates still appeared grim but 
were no longer distraught. 
</P>
<P>
Tynan said his decision to direct a resumption of deliberations was based not 
only on assurances from Rodriguez but also on his own observations of the 
jurors and alternates as they reported to court Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed able to carry on with their task," the judge said, adding that he 
had been prepared to suspend deliberations for a few days if jurors had seemed 
"shaky." 
</P>
<P>
Tynan also said he received a note Wednesday morning from one of the jurors 
expressing her gratitude for the way he conducted Tuesday's emotion-laden 
session. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Tynan summoned the jurors and alternates and told them the 
details of the murder-suicide, while stressing that it should have no effect on 
their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us, all of us, have personal problems that impact on our lives," Tynan 
said. "Quite obviously, even Phyllis Singletary, it appeared to me, was able to 
go about her business." 
</P>
<P>
The somber jurors stared intently at Tynan as he went on. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how deeply you are affected . . . it must in no way be permitted to 
influence you in the performance of your duty. 
</P>
<P>
"You are admonished in the strongest possible terms that your decision in this 
case must be based on the evidence you have received and heard in this 
courtroom and from no other source," Tynan said. 
</P>
<P>
"To do otherwise would be a violation of your oath as jurors and a disservice 
to both the prosecution and the defense, as well as to our system. I am not 
unaware or unsympathetic to your grief over the death of Ms. Singletary. But we 
must deal with our grief in our own way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury on Friday morning had to begin deliberations anew -- after 12 1/2 days 
-- because Tynan dismissed a juror who fell asleep twice during deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
California law requires a jury to begin deliberations from scratch any time a 
juror is replaced by an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
Clark admitted that he was not surprised by Tynan's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge is human. I'm human. And I'm influenced by public opinion. The law 
is supposed to try to take as much out of that as it can. But law is politics. 
Everything is politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies, including 
attempted murder, burglary, rape, sodomy and oral copulation, resulting from a 
series of nighttime residential burglaries throughout Los Angeles County, 
mostly in the spring and summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could face the death penalty. He also faces separate murder 
and attempted murder charges in Orange County and in San Francisco.

<P>
The Polish Communist Party's two longtime parliamentary allies bolted their old 
coalition Wednesday and agreed to back a Solidarity-led government with Lech 
Walesa as premier. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity lawmakers, with their new partners in the United Peasants' Party and 
Democratic Party looking on, endorsed a resolution Wednesday night calling for 
Walesa to be named premier at the head of what would be the first non-Communist 
government in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the United Peasants and Democratic parties voted to abandon 
their alliance with the Communists that began 40 years ago and to join forces 
with Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski to Get Plan 
</P>
<P>
The new coalition intends to present its plan today to President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski, who retains the power to nominate the premier. 
</P>
<P>
One Solidarity lawmaker, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said there are indications -- but 
no firm assurances -- that Jaruzelski will agree to the plan if it carries the 
approval of the three parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We must take some risks," Kaczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, Walesa appeared to give out conflicting signals as to whether 
he would serve as premier of a new government. Before the Solidarity vote, 
Walesa told the delegates of all three parties, meeting in the main chamber of 
the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, that he would accept the post. "I never 
dreamed that Lech Walesa could be premier," he said. "I never even imagined 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Early today, however, he was quoted as saying, "I will not be premier," and 
adding, "There are better people than Walesa" for the job. But to complicate 
matters further, he added that he had not yet made his final decision. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa was greeted with loud applause as he arrived at the meeting from his 
home in Gdansk. In a brief speech, he said the choice to enter government was a 
difficult one, "but there is no other one, and we must undertake it. . . . We 
came here to change Poland." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nod of Gratitude 
</P>
<P>
He gave a special nod of gratitude to "our elder friends from the Peasants' 
Party and Democratic Party" who earlier in the day had voted to endorse his 
proposal to form a Solidarity-led coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"Together we will teach the (Communist Party) pluralism, freedom and listening 
to others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, it remained uncertain whether the Communists, reeling from setback to 
setback in the rush of political events, would turn over control of the 
government. Communist lawmakers, in a separate meeting, appointed a group to 
formulate a stand on the question, and there were signs of growing resistance 
from Communist Party leaders. There was continuing uncertainty as well over the 
reaction of the Soviet Union to the possibility of a Solidarity government in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, in what was described as an 
emotional speech before a closed meeting of Communist members of the Sejm, 
accused Walesa of violating the spirit of the "round-table" accords signed in 
April. Those accords, signed by the government and the opposition, re-legalized 
Solidarity and endorsed measures aimed at pulling Poland out of its political 
and economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have entered a period of an open fight for power," Rakowski said, according 
to the official Polish news agency PAP. He urged the party to stand firm. "The 
situation is dangerous," he said, "but it is not time to put up our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity deputy Aleksander Paczynski opened the joint caucus of the new 
opposition coalition, whose 264 votes should control the 460-member Sejm, with 
two proposals certain to raise even more Communist alarm. He called for a 
renegotiation of the round-table accords to bring about new and fully free 
elections in two years instead of four, as the accords now state. And he 
proposed shifting control of the Communist-run state television and radio to 
the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Through such "spectacular, quick decisions," Paczynski said, a Solidarity 
government led by Walesa would ease public anger and impatience and demonstrate 
that substantive changes are under way. The round-table accords should be 
renegotiated, he said, because neither side should be bound by agreements 
"reached in a different time, in a different situation and under different 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed by Solidarity lawmakers said that the "parliamentary 
coalition of the Peasants' Party, the Democratic Party and Solidarity is 
capable of forming a government of national responsibility under the leadership 
of Lech Walesa in which all political forces of our country could be 
represented, all forces which are determined to act in favor of political and 
economic reform." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa last week suggested that Solidarity was prepared to form Poland's new 
government but that it would continue to reject Communist entreaties to join in 
a Communist-led government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready to Step Aside 
</P>
<P>
But the situation continued to develop rapidly when the newly elected premier, 
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, announced Monday that he was ready to step aside in 
favor of Roman Malinowski, the United Peasants' Party leader. Malinowski, 
Kiszczak said, had a better chance of forming a broad-based government. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, however, quickly rejected Kiszczak's idea, and Malinowski's own 
party gave it virtually no support. Malinowski himself has not commented on the 
proposal, and his nomination now appears to be a dead issue. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said Tuesday, after insistent questioning from journalists, that he 
would accept the post of premier "if society wants it" but insisted that he 
preferred that someone else take the job. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that if Solidarity did take over the government, it would leave 
the sensitive interior and defense ministries in the hands of the Communists, a 
pledge that was designed to ease nervousness in Moscow and in party 
headquarters in Warsaw. He added that Solidarity would have no intention of 
pulling Poland out of its Warsaw Pact military commitments with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow mildly described Walesa's pledge as 
"sensible." 
</P>
<P>
"Poland is a member of the Warsaw Pact," said ministry spokesman Yuri A. 
Gremitsky, "and Solidarity should make the necessary conclusions as a result of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Gremitsky said the Soviet Union is "very much concerned" about the Polish 
situation, but "we don't interfere in the internal affairs of that country," 
and he added, "The Polish people should decide themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper commentaries in Moscow, however, have warned that a Solidarity 
attempt to take the government could destabilize Poland and Europe and threaten 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the Soviet concern over Poland, Adam Michnik, a Solidarity 
member of Parliament and the editor of the journal Gazeta Wyborca, wrote 
Tuesday that "Solidarity is not a movement that is in the grips of an 
anti-Soviet phobia." 
</P>
<P>
A continued push by Solidarity on the issue, which now seems likely, would 
provide the first substantive test of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
toleration for East Bloc experiments in democracy. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as July 6, in a speech before the European Parliament, Gorbachev 
said that change "in some particular countries . . . is exclusively a matter 
for the people themselves and of their choice." He added: "Any interference in 
internal affairs, any attempts to limit the sovereignty of states -- both 
friends and allies or anybody else -- are inadmissible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Clear Indication 
</P>
<P>
As the Polish reform experiment moves further into uncharted territory, 
however, there is still no clear indication of whether the Communists would 
actually relinquish power, regardless of the alliances in the newly elected 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Another Communist Party official Wednesday appeared to cast grave doubt on the 
question. Slawomir Wiatr, secretary of the party's Central Committee, said the 
Polish party "would not take responsibility" for the consequences of a 
Solidarity attempt to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
"Every thinking man, the more so a politician," Wiatr said, "should realize 
that we are not a state of parliamentary democracy yet. Having a majority in 
Parliament is not in itself a sufficient condition to exercise power. It will 
take us some time still to arrive at a system in which political parties will 
be able to alternate as ruling parties without destructive results for the 
state and society. We should all remember that." 
</P>
<P>
President Jaruzelski called Tuesday for an urgent meeting of "main political 
and social forces" to seek what he called "rational solutions" for Poland's 
political impasse. No such meeting was held Wednesday, and the president's 
office would not say when it might occur. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said he did not know when he would see Jaruzelski. 
</P>
<P>
As the parliamentary caucus of Solidarity and the United Peasants and 
Democratic parties began, it was uncertain when its resolution might be 
introduced to the Sejm, but it seemed likely that intense behind-the-scenes 
negotiations with the Communist leadership would be required first. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS IN POLAND 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's Lech Walesa has refused to accept any government led by newly 
elected Communist Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak. Now two smaller parties, longtime 
Communist allies, agree to back a Solidarity-led coalition, with Walesa as 
premier. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNIST PARTY: On Aug. 2, Czeslaw Kiszczak was named Poland's premier and 
immediately tried to persuade Solidarity to join a "grand coalition." But 
Walesa, whose party holds 161 seats in the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, 
blocked that attempt. On Monday, Kiszczak said he would step aside in favor of 
United Peasants' leader Roman Malinowski. But that idea also was rejected by 
Solidarity when Malinowski's own party gave the idea virtually no support. 
</P>
<P>
SOLIDARITY: Lech Walesa, although committed to a Solidarity-led government, is 
issuing conflicting signals as to whether he would serve as premier. Solidarity 
says that if it heads a new government, the sensitive ministries of interior 
and defense would remain in the hands of the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
UNITED PEASANTS' PARTY: Once regarded as the Communists' most important 
partner, with 76 seats in the 460-seat Sejm. Led by Malinowski, a 54-year-old 
economist, the United Peasants abandoned a four-decade Communist alliance and 
endorsed a Solidarity-led coalition headed by Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATIC PARTY: The other key pro-Communist party, which holds 27 seats in 
Parliament, also bolted the alliance by voting for the Solidarity-led 
coalition. Like the United Peasants, the Democrats have been seeking more 
political independence. Led by Jerzy Jozwiak.

NEW SENTENCING RULES MEAN LIFE FOR 1ST OFFENDER 
</P>

<P>
Ernest (Polo) Staley was small potatoes as drug dealers go. The feds caught him 
with a measly 686 grams of crack. A street value of maybe $68,000. No prior 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
But Polo Staley, small-time hood, this week got something that even the big 
timers rarely get: life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the starkest examples of tough new federal sentencing guidelines, 
U.S. District Judge William Stafford in Tallahassee, Fla., sent Staley to 
prison for good. No chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutor Mike Moore was jubilant. "We caught him selling crack just 
once, but he'll never sell it again, and that's the kind of justice I want." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Court Rules 
</P>
<P>
It is justice that Congress legislated into existence with the Sentencing 
Reform Act of 1987. Many judges were hesitant to use the new standards until 
the Supreme Court upheld them last January. Now the federal courts are 
beginning to experience the full effects. 
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines were meant to end disparities prevalent in the federal 
system, where two criminals might have received vastly different sentences for 
very similar offenses. 
</P>
<P>
A judge now has a strict range of sentencing for a crime, with specified 
aggravating and mitigating factors that may nudge the prison term up or down. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Judge Stafford studied a pre-sentence report from the U. S. 
Probation Office that matter-of-factly totaled up enough points to seal away 
the 30-year-old Staley for all his days. 
</P>
<P>
Those 686 grams of crack translated into 36 points on a sentencing table, which 
converts into a term of 188 to 235 months for a first-time offender. 
</P>
<P>
But there were these aggravating factors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Staley was the "kingpin" of a drug organization, a small one, yes, with 
maybe only five workers, but an organization nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A firearm was involved. Staley bought a handgun and gave it to one of his 
street-level dealers for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The defendant tried to obstruct justice, offering to pay off a key witness 
to skip town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Points Added Up 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, these facts rang up yet more points on the sentencing score 
card. Forty-three is enough for life. Staley had 44. 
</P>
<P>
Public defender Robin Rosen knew the sum only too well. She pleaded with the 
judge. "I've represented people who took lives and received less of a 
sentence," she said. "It's a tragedy. I'm not saying this as an attorney; I'm 
saying this as a human being. Everybody has worth and dignity. Everybody should 
have a chance at rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
Staley's father, a minister, urged the judge to show mercy. So did Staley's 
mother, a missionary. Finally, the defendant himself spoke up: 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember J. F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King saying every man and woman 
makes a difference. In order to make a difference, you have to be given a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Staley said that his months in prison awaiting trial already had beckoned him 
toward redemption. "I know drugs are a terrible problem, destroying our 
nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Stafford agreed up to a point. Indeed, crack was a scourge. 
</P>
<P>
But he reminded Staley that he had been convicted of three drug counts: 
possession, distribution and conspiracy -- that he had ferried cocaine from 
city to city and cooked the powder himself into pellets of crack. 
</P>
<P>
There were no extenuating circumstances to take this case outside the 
guidelines, the judge concluded: "It seems to me your activity was the type you 
could stop at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen, the defense lawyer, plans an appeal, finding fault with the 
pre-sentencing report. "I'm still stunned by the tragedy of this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Staley's punishment is unusual, federal officials said -- 
extraordinarily rare for a first offender, especially in a case involving 686 
grams, or less than two pounds, of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Sentences Common 
</P>
<P>
But there is no doubt that tougher federal sentences are becoming the rule. 
"Guys are getting 15, 20, 25 years without parole, and a lot of times we're 
just talking about two-three ounces of cocaine," said Assistant U.S. Atty. John 
Gordon, chief of the Los Angeles gang drug task force. 
</P>
<P>
"Prisons are going to be so jammed it's unbelievable. Everything is changing . 
. . . We intend to put up flyers with the faces of guys, with their sentence 
underneath, to show their friends what's happened to them." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if the new federal law has been consistently tougher, it also has created a 
greater disparity with the state system, where penalties are usually not as 
severe. "That's the new crap shoot for the defendant: state or federal," 
Gordon, the prosecutor, said. 
</P>
<P>
Many defense attorneys oppose the new guidelines, arguing that they restrict 
the discretion of judges too much. "Sentencing by numbers has a real risk of 
treating some people too harshly and others not harshly enough," said Neal 
Sonnett, president of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who were minor offenders in the general scheme of things are 
now being sentenced to the kind of terms we used to preserve for major dealers. 
I'm not sure that's a productive way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about it. A lot of people get caught up in other people's business. A 
lot get caught up in drugs because of peer group pressure."

STUDY FINDS NEW MOTHERS' DRINKING PUTS INFANT AT RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drinking alcohol while breast feeding may cause "slight but significant" damage 
to an infant's motor development, according to a new study that calls into 
question the advice given to some new mothers that they have a drink to relax 
and ease breast feeding. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that 
the 1-year-old children of women who had one to four drinks a day scored 
slightly lower on psycho-motor tests than children whose mothers had had less 
than one drink a day. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the children's agility in skills such as crawling, balancing 
and throwing would be discernible only to a trained observer, according to the 
researchers. The two groups of children scored no differently on mental tests, 
which gauge a child's intelligence or IQ. 
</P>
<P>
Experts were somewhat divided Wednesday on the significance of the results. 
</P>
<P>
"I would advise healthy skepticism, bearing in mind that this is the first 
study of its kind," said Ruth E. Little, an epidemiologist at the University of 
Michigan who headed the study. "However, I would say that we can no longer 
guarantee that drinking during breast feeding is safe for the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Welch, a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, said: "We have to 
begin to rethink what the effect could be of advising alcohol . . . to help in 
breast feeding, and instead begin to think, 'Maybe this isn't such a good 
idea.' " 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who directs the high-risk pregnancy unit at Hutzel Hospital at Wayne 
State University in Detroit, called that traditional advice "one of the old 
midwifery-type tricks." He said some hospitals serve beer or wine with meals 
for nursing mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Little estimated that 10% of breast-feeding mothers drink regularly in the 
United States. That percentage varies by region and is likely to be relatively 
high among affluent women on the East and West coasts. 
</P>
<P>
The study, by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of 
Washington, examined 400 children of white, well-educated, middle-class women. 
The women were placed in five groups reflecting their alcohol consumption, 
ranging from zero to four drinks a day. 
</P>
<P>
A drink was defined as one bottle of beer, one glass of wine or one cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
When the children were tested at one year of age, those whose mothers had drunk 
from one to four drinks a day scored an average of five points lower on a 
standard test that measures so-called psycho-motor skills, such as reflexes and 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The infants of mothers who had consumed at least one drink had an average score 
of 98 on the so-called Psychomotor Development Index; the others had an average 
of 103. In general, scores range from 50 to 150; 100 is the average in the 
overall population. 
</P>
<P>
"In the typical child, a small decrease in motor skills at one year is not a 
disaster," Little said in a telephone interview. "The kind of decrease we saw 
on average is something that only a trained person could pick up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant Finding' 
</P>
<P>
Little and others said the effect may be most worrisome at a societal level. If 
small amounts of harm are done to large numbers of children, the impact is 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant finding not so much from the individual patient 
standpoint but (because) of the impact of alcohol on society," Welch said. 
"It's the multiplication of the problem, the compounding of the problem, where 
you begin to detect an effect." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Little said the study is cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby is taking in a substance that is toxic," she said. "I think that's 
worth worrying about, especially because the baby's brain is growing at a very, 
very rapid rate and we know the brain is vulnerable to alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, "These were women who really didn't drink very much, or 
were social drinkers, I would say. If you're talking about women drinking more 
than that and nursing, I would worry about those women and the amount that 
their babies are getting." 
</P>
<P>
Precisely how small amounts of alcohol could be harmful remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Exquisitely Sensitive' 
</P>
<P>
In the paper, the researchers theorized that the infant brain may be 
"exquisitely sensitive" to small quantities of pure alcohol. Or, the infant may 
be unable to metabolize alcohol as quickly as an adult, so it accumulates in 
the child's body. 
</P>
<P>
As for why mental skills would be unchanged, Little said the answer could be 
timing: The infant's exposure to alcohol might have occurred at a time when the 
part of the brain that controls motor skills was particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Or, she said, the mental tests may be too crude to pick up subtle changes. 
</P>
<P>
Little suggested caution in interpreting the results, emphasizing that they 
need to be confirmed in additional studies. "I have two daughters (who are 
nursing their own babies) and I have not warned them," she said. "I have not 
even mentioned (the study). I think it's too preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cheston Berlin, a professor of pediatrics at Pennsylvania State University 
and adviser to the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he believed that one to 
two drinks a week would pose no problem to breast-feeding women, but one to two 
a day would cause him concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Occasional Drink Advised 
</P>
<P>
La Leche League International, a 30-year-old group that provides information on 
breast feeding, advises nursing women to drink only occasionally. "When we're 
saying occasional, we're talking about once or twice a week at most," 
spokeswoman Julie Stock said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a patient who was having significant problems with breast feeding and 
having difficulty with milk let-down, I still would not be reluctant to go 
ahead and prescribe alcohol," said Welch of Wayne State. "However, I would 
certainly have to caution them that this study exists and that they certainly 
would not want to use alcohol on any kind of chronic basis." 
</P>
<P>
Welch said the study also illustrates the fact that "physicians and mothers are 
up against it. There really is nothing that seems to be safe for the newborn 
that the mother can take to relax her to allow for successful breast feeding. 
What it really means is that families have to support their breast-feeding 
mothers. If they have a lot of encouragement and support, they'll do far 
better."

GUN SHOW PROMOTERS FEAR STATE BULLETIN MAY SHOOT DOWN SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angry California gun show promoters are fearful that their 
multimillion-dollar-per-year industry will be crippled by a state attorney 
general's office bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies last month that 
declares it illegal in most cases to sell handguns at the weekend events. But 
so far, the bulletin seems to have had little effect on the sale of such 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
If the law, as interpreted by the attorney general, were strictly enforced it 
would be a severe blow to the shows at which handgun sales make up a major part 
of the business. But in the six weeks since the July 3 advisory was issued to 
police chiefs and sheriffs throughout the state, handguns continued to be sold 
at the shows, and apparently only one police agency has even warned gun dealers 
that the law will be enforced in the future. Some local law enforcement 
agencies were unaware of the bulletin and some appeared to be uncertain about 
what is expected of them when queried by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office bulletin does not cite any new laws in 
controlling handgun sales. Instead, it interprets several provisions in the 
state Penal Code, some of which have gone unenforced at gun shows. One clause, 
the attorney general said, prohibits state licensed handgun dealers from 
conducting business at the events. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, licensed as well as unlicensed vendors conduct handgun transactions 
at the shows. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin also states that unlicensed handgun vendors must use a licensed 
dealer to process the sale of a handgun -- which includes a criminal record 
check -- unless the buyer is personally known to the vendor. It also points out 
that vendors, licensed and unlicensed, must observe a 15-day waiting period 
even when selling handguns to personal acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
If licensed dealers are excluded from the shows, the unlicensed vendors would 
have no one to legally process handgun sales at the events. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, enforcement of the law, as interpreted by the attorney general's office, 
would prohibit virtually all handgun sales at the weekend events, leaving only 
rifles and shotguns to be sold legally. The bulletin does not affect antique 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of a rifle or shotgun does not require a 15-day wait or a buyer's 
criminal records check under state law, but a bill by Assemblyman Lloyd G. 
Connelly (D-Sacramento) now under consideration in the Legislature would put 
sales of such weapons under the same restrictions as handguns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affect on Gun Shows 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the law also would affect gun shows by allowing licensed gun dealers 
to act as brokers for sales by unlicensed vendors, but only within the 
jurisdiction in which they are licensed. In the meantime, gun show promoters 
maintain that Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is using the bulletin 
as a tool in his campaign for governor. But an official in Van de Kamp's office 
pointed out the bulletin was issued without any fanfare or even a press 
release. The gun show operators insist that handgun vendors at the events are 
breaking no laws and that licensed gun dealers are acting only as "agents," not 
as dealers, making arrangements for sales but not actually delivering the 
weapons at the shows. 
</P>
<P>
And the shows will go on, vowed Richard DeChambeau, executive director of the 
Gun Owners of California, a militantly pro-gun organization retained by the 
promoters of the events to represent them in their opposition to the attorney 
general's bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to conduct business as usual in a lawful manner," DeChambeau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But even the Gun Owners of California's legal counsel, Kent DeChambeau -- 
Richard DeChambeau's father -- is not certain what is lawful when it comes to 
selling handguns. 
</P>
<P>
The provision in the law prohibiting licensed handgun dealers from conducting 
business at gun shows appears clear enough: 
</P>
<P>
"The business shall be carried on only in the building designated in the 
license." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Act as 'Agents' 
</P>
<P>
Kent DeChambeau insisted, however, that this restriction does not prevent 
licensed dealers from going to gun shows as "agents" rather than dealers and 
brokering sales for non-licensed vendors at gun shows, arranging for criminal 
record checks and for the delivery of handguns after the required 15-day wait. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, DeChambeau at first said it would be unlawful for 
unlicensed dealers to arrange for the sales of their own handguns by accepting 
deposits and filling out application forms, but shortly afterward he changed 
his mind, saying that a dealer somehow might be able to act as his own agent 
without breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
DeChambeau does agree, however, that the law requires everyone, dealer and 
non-dealer alike, to wait 15 days before delivering a handgun to a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Are guys walking out with a handgun in their hand?" DeChambeau asked. "They're 
not supposed to be. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials complain that handguns frequently are sold on 
the spot, without a 15-day wait or a criminal records check, at the largely 
unregulated gun shows, and a Times reporter earlier this year was able to buy 
handguns cash and carry at gun shows all over the state. The law enforcement 
officials contend that the shows provide a marketplace for stolen weapons and a 
source of firearms for gun smugglers, drug dealers, gang members and other 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only One Agency Acts 
</P>
<P>
Still, promoters say that only one police agency has taken any action 
whatsoever in response to the attorney general's bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino police distributed copies of the bulletin as a warning at a gun 
show in that city on Aug. 6 but took no other action despite the open sale of 
handguns at the event. 
</P>
<P>
"The next gun show we'll probably be down there enforcing what the law says," 
said Capt. Larry Richards. "Nobody told them to quit operating (immediately). 
We were putting them on notice." 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, where police are noted for closer than ordinary scrutiny of gun 
shows, Chief Richard Tefank said the bulletin on handgun sales will be referred 
to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for guidance before the 
next Pomona gun show in November. 
</P>
<P>
In Fresno and Pasadena, where gun shows were held in mid and late July, police 
said they were unaware of the bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, in a statement approved by 
Undersheriff Robert Edmonds, declared that the attorney general's bulletin will 
have no effect on its policing of gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The information bulletin," said the statement issued by Deputy Richard 
Dinsmoor, "will not change the Sheriff's Department's approach to law 
enforcement at gun shows. The bulletin basically provides a summary of 
California laws that are already in effect. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Dinsmoor said the department polices gun shows primarily by responding to 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is responsible for law enforcement in Palmdale, where 
a gun show was held last weekend, but deputies did not attend the event, 
Dinsmoor said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were handguns on sale at the Palmdale show, but vendors were offering 
the weapons cash-and-carry, no waiting, no records check.

AMANDA BLAKE OF 'GUNSMOKE' TV FAME DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Amanda Blake, the earthy Miss Kitty who ran the Longbranch Saloon on 
the long-running television series "Gunsmoke," died of oral and throat cancer 
in Sacramento's Mercy Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Blake, 58, underwent surgery for oral cancer in 1977 and afterward made 
appearances throughout the country on behalf of the American Cancer Society. 
She was once a two-pack-a-day smoker. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Cancer Society named her as the recipient of its Courage Award, 
which was presented to Blake in the Oval Office by President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Blake endeared herself to a generation of television viewers as Kitty Russell, 
a worldly wise woman with a compassionate heart beneath a crusty exterior. She 
projected a subdued sensuality and a clear implication that Marshal Matt 
Dillon, played by James Arness, had only to show his interest and she would 
gladly become romantically involved with him. 
</P>
<P>
Blake left "Gunsmoke" in 1974 after 19 years in television's Dodge City. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired and it was time to go," she told The Times in a 1984 interview. 
"It was the end of the trail. The show only lasted one more year without me." 
</P>
<P>
After "Gunsmoke," she only worked sporadically, usually in guest appearances 
for television game shows, movies of the week and such series as "Edge of 
Night," "Hart to Hart," and "Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Blake was born Beverly Neill in Buffalo, N.Y., on Feb. 20, 1931. 
</P>
<P>
Her fifth marriage, in April, 1984, was to Mark Spaeth, a city councilman and 
developer in Austin, Tex. The couple later divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for next week in Sacramento, hospital spokeswoman Pat 
Lenihan said. 
</P>
<P>
A more detailed obituary on Amanda Blake will appear in Friday's editions of 
The Times.

UNREINFORCED BUILDINGS STIR S.F. QUAKE CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VALARIE BASHEDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a city that many might think would be the capital of earthquake 
preparedness, there are more than 2,100 unreinforced brick buildings in use 
here that experts say are sure to collapse when the next big one hits. 
</P>
<P>
City officials know of the danger. In fact, it was city engineers who 
identified the unsafe structures four years ago. Furthermore, San Francisco law 
contains strict, continually updated seismic building codes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the codes have a loophole. They pertain only to buildings erected 
after 1948. Th ere is no legislation requiring owners to reinforce unsafe 
buildings that went up before that. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers have known since the 1930s that these older brick homes, apartment 
houses and offices -- called unreinforced masonry buildings or UMBs -- cannot 
withstand a severe side-to-side shaking. But they continue to be occupied, 
mostly in the Chinatown and low-income Tenderloin districts of the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerned with official inaction say the reasons have nothing to do with 
safety and everything to do with politics. Elected officials fear the fallout 
from landlords and tenants who foresee rent increases that could drive 
low-income residents out into the streets. City officials also say other 
problems -- such as homelessness or the AIDS crisis -- take precedence in the 
order of chronic woes they address. 
</P>
<P>
"If disaster strikes, we'll say it's terrible, why didn't we do something?" 
said city Supervisor Tom Hsieh. "Until you see the blood, I guess nothing's 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Those supporting a tougher approach say San Francisco should copy Los Angeles, 
which enacted legislation in 1981 requiring landlords to make their buildings 
structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco city planner Paul Deutsch agrees and notes that there are 
official moves in that direction. But Deutsch says that his city -- by 
conducting an environmental impact study before it takes action -- is trying to 
avoid some of the pitfalls Los Angeles has encountered. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles ordinance requires all property owners with UMBs to reinforce 
their buildings and complete the work by 1992. Reinforcing methods include 
anchoring wood frames together with steel bolts, spraying reinforced concrete 
on the walls and strengthening roofs and supportive interior walls by adding 
plywood, according to Karl Deppe, chief of earthquake preparedness in the 
city's Building and Safety Department. About 5,000 of Los Angeles' 
approximately 8,000 old brick buildings have been strengthened or work is under 
way and 1,000 have been torn down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But among the upgraded buildings, rents have increased an average of $70 a 
month per tenant, according to James Fleck, a Los Angeles city housing planner 
and economic analyst. In addition, because of the decision to tear down many 
old structures rather than bring them up to code, thousands of people have been 
displaced each year since the program began, he said. Where these tenants went 
is not known. "They move somewhere else or they move in the street," Fleck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch fears a similar scenario could take place in San Francisco, where the 
2,100 buildings identified in the 1985 survey include 25,000 residential units. 
He said there has been no specific count of the people living in shaky 
buildings, but he said estimates exceed 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a $60-million bond issue on the November ballot will request 
funds to be partially used for seismic improvements to public buildings, which 
make up 30 to 40 of the 2,100 deemed to be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems facing seismic safety programs, adherents say, is that 
people tend to ignore life-threatening situations until disaster hits. So while 
many people associate San Francisco with the great 1906 earthquake that 
virtually leveled the city and killed 700 people, that 8.3 temblor occurred too 
long ago to frighten current city residents. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1933 Long Beach earthquake that prompted the first state legislation 
requiring earthquake safety standards on new buildings. That quake, at 
magnitude 6.2, damaged more than 86% of the city's unreinforced brick 
buildings, according to Deppe, and erased any doubts about the danger of brick 
buildings in earthquake country. Unlike wood frame or steel structures, 
buildings made of brick have no elasticity and, if they are old, are frequently 
held together with deteriorating mortar that disintegrates under pressure, 
according to Frank Lew, San Francisco seismic safety program manager. In the 
jarring of a quake, the bricks separate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once that happens, you've lost the bearing and support and the walls come 
tumbling down on your head," Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
Aware of the danger, the city in 1948 prohibited construction of buildings that 
could not sustain minimal damage during a minor earthquake. The new codes 
required builders to use wood frames, attach frames with steel bolts or 
construct inside walls designed to provide interior support to a building, Lew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no such standards were applied to San Francisco's many brick buildings 
built earlier. Nor, for that matter, were earthquake safeguards ever required 
on the estimated 35,000 other such buildings in the seismic region stretching 
from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles, according to Fred Turner, staff 
structural engineer for the governor's seismic safety commission. 
</P>
<P>
To force the issue and require retrofitting of old buildings is "an expensive 
proposition," said Deutsch. "It takes new and bigger earthquakes to provide the 
political will to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Usui, senior structural engineer for Los Angeles' earthquake safety agency, 
agreed that making old buildings earthquake-safe is not just a matter of 
construction. If costs are too high, owners tend to try to raise rents, sell 
out or convert the property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those with no direct stake in the buildings tend not to be concerned 
until disaster strikes. "All of this adds up to a political problem," Usui 
said. "It takes a major occurrence like the (1971) Sylmar earthquake to drive 
the politicians and everybody along to get these buildings improved to a level 
of safety." 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a destructive quake in recent memory, San Francisco's efforts at 
upgrading risky buildings remain stalemated. The only progress the city has 
made in the four years since its survey of UMBs has been to allocate $500,000 
for the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a horrible either/or thing," said Brad Paul, deputy mayor for 
housing and neighborhoods. "Faced with the choice of having people die in the 
future or spend the rest of their lives living in the streets, my guess is that 
politicians haven't wanted to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Hsieh, a former architect who witnessed 1987's Whittier earthquake, 
fears that Chinatown and the Tenderloin could be reduced to rubble before the 
city takes action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry with the passive style of politicians on this issue," he said. He 
said he saw how quickly an earthquake can take apart a brick building. For 
those inside, he said, "you don't even have a chance."

BEIRUT'S CHRISTIANS FACING GENOCIDE, MAHONY ASSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony told a solemn prayer vigil in Los Angeles on 
Wednesday night that the "very survival" of Christians in war-torn Beirut is 
threatened by a joint Syrian and Iran offensive. And he called for the nations 
of the world to seek a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the words of Pope John Paul II, Mahony said that the combined attacks, 
including the fierce bombardment of Christian enclaves in recent days, 
constitutes genocide on the part of Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that whatever (the) political reason, the Syrians appear to 
support the total annihilation of the Christian Lebanese people," said Mahony, 
who headed a fact-finding trip to the Middle East earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 years of claiming that its presence in Lebanon was needed to guarantee 
Syria's security, Mahony said that "finally and unfortunately, the truth of the 
real motives" of the Syrian leaders is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire international community, together with the United Nations, must 
take immediate steps to seek a cease-fire and to pressure both Syria and Iran 
to back away from their announced intentions," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
The archbishop's remarks were greeted with enthusiastic applause and cheers by 
an estimated 300 members of the Lebanese and Armenian communities who collected 
on the steps of Immaculate Conception Catholic Church and spilled onto the 
sidewalk and into the street on West 9th. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of demonstrators had earlier paraded in front of the church, singing a 
hymn and carrying signs reading "USA Save Lebanon," "Stop the Massacre of 
Christians in Lebanon" and "Pray for Peace and Freedom in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Salem, one of the organizers, said the purpose of the vigil was to offer 
prayers for suffering and dying Lebanese caught in the Beirut bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
"We come together to pray that the mighty nations of the world will take note 
of this precious land and say to those who would oppress and murder that enough 
is enough," Salem said. 
</P>
<P>
Two local political leaders, State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Los 
Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, spoke briefly, expressing their 
support of calls for an end to the threat to Lebanese Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a genocide occurring now in the tiny country of Lebanon, and any 
human being who cares about another must make it stop," Torres declared. 
</P>
<P>
"God Bless, Lebanon," Ferraro said.

ANTI-WESTERN CLERIC ELECTED IRAN SPEAKER

Iran's Parliament showed its radical bent Wednesday by electing a fiercely 
anti-Western cleric to the powerful post of speaker. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report monitored in Nicosia, said Mehdi 
Karrubi, 52, was chosen over moderate Ali Akbar Nategh-Noori by a 147-92 vote. 
</P>
<P>
He will succeed Hashemi Rafsanjani, regarded as a centrist, who is to be sworn 
in as president today. Rafsanjani reportedly backed Nategh-Noori. 
</P>
<P>
Karrubi's election had been expected because of the balance of forces in the 
single-chamber Majlis, where hard-liners favoring a militant foreign policy 
strengthened their hold in April, 1988, elections. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, 54, who won last month's presidential election by a landslide, will 
be responsible to the Majlis, which sets the outlines of domestic and foreign 
policies and has the right to impeach the president andministers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Karrubi's election is viewed as unlikely to affect Iran's stance on 
many key issues, such as the fate of Western hostages held by pro-Iranian 
militants in Lebanon. Such issues traditionally have been decided by a handful 
of top leaders in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, who was deputy speaker of the Majlis for several years, led 
anti-Western demonstrations in Mecca during the annual hajj pilgrimage in 1987. 
Clashes with Saudi security forces resulted in the deaths of more than 400 
people, most of them Iranians. Karrubi later blamed the deaths on "a calculated 
plot designed by American and Israeli advisers."

THE CALI CARTEL: COLOMBIA'S GENTLEMEN COCAINE TRAFFICKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CALI, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ciudad Jardin, Cali's most exclusive suburb, boasts a dazzling array of walled 
mansions on hillsides entwined with curving streets and blooming with satellite 
dishes. This is the neighborhood of choice for the dons of the Cali cartel, 
Colombia's gentlemen cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Like the more savage and notorious Medellin cartel, the Cali traffickers use 
Colombia as a base for smuggling huge amounts of cocaine into the United 
States. But the Cali cartel prefers whenever possible to avoid the open 
violence, including assassinations of high officials, that has focused world 
attention on the Medellin gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the philosophy of the Cali cartel, it is preferable to bribe than 
to kill," said a Colombian investigative reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The Cali traffickers try to blend peacefully with the wealthy elite in this 
clean and prosperous city of 1.5 million people, seeking respect and security 
through investments and carefully cultivated contacts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strong Influence' 
</P>
<P>
"They have 'levers,' as we say here," said a Roman Catholic priest in Cali. 
"They have strong influences in all sectors." 
</P>
<P>
When murder is required to assert their illicit power, the Cali dons also try 
to use discretion, said Col. Jose Pelaez, chief of Colombia's judicial police. 
"They abduct their victims and make them disappear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Cali-based cocaine trade has thrived in relative obscurity, drawing 
less attention than the Medellin cartel from both news media and law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely know a lot less about the Cali people than we do about the 
Medellin people," said an agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
But the low profile of the Cali traffickers is deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are very big, maybe not as big as the Medellin people, but I 
think they have been gaining ground steadily," the DEA agent said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most famous residents of Ciudad Jardin are brothers Gilberto and 
Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Together, they are said to dominate the Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The two grew up in a poor section of Cali, far from the luxury of Ciudad 
Jardin. As youths, they took low-paying jobs as drugstore clerks. Miguel earned 
a law degree from Cali's prestigious San Buenaventura University, which is run 
by Franciscan priests. Gilberto never finished high school. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Gilberto allegedly tried his hand at kidnaping, a lucrative 
industry in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the brothers built up an impressive business empire, 
including a national chain of discount drugstores, a pharmaceutical laboratory, 
a radio network, a bank, a Chrysler Corp. agency, a bus fleet, a professional 
soccer team and ranches and other real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug officials say there is no doubt that much of the Rodriguez Orejuelas' 
investment capital has come from cocaine and that millions of dollars in 
trafficking profits have been laundered through their other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto's reputation as an astute strategist has earned him a nickname: The 
Chess Player. Heavy jowled and well dressed at 50, his looks fit the role of 
successful business executive. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel, 45, is said to be equally shrewd. He enjoys local popularity as vice 
president of Club America, the soccer team controlled by the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
People in Cali hear and read about the cocaine cartel, but many tend to 
overlook its sinister implications. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like the Holy Spirit, which exists but isn't seen," said a Cali 
newspaper editor. A senior partner in the Rodriguez Orejuelas' organization is 
Jose Santacruz Londono, 45. He has invested heavily in Cali real estate and 
construction projects and currently is said to be the main financier behind a 
large shopping center being built on a prime Cali site once occupied by Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Called Don Chepe, Santacruz Londono is nearly 6 feet tall and weighs more than 
250 pounds. According to local lore, he once tried to join Cali's exclusive 
Club Colombia but was blackballed, so he built a mansion in Ciudad Jardin that 
resembles the club building. 
</P>
<P>
Another leading member of the loosely linked Cali Cartel is Francisco Herrera. 
A young man known as Don Pacho, Herrera is the son of Benjamin Herrera Zuleta, 
a pioneer trafficker who began moving cocaine in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The father, nicknamed the Black Pope, was convicted this year on 
drug-trafficking charges in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Several anti-drug officials admitted in interviews that they have little 
information about other major cartel figures. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many we don't know about," lamented a DEA investigator, adding 
that investigative manpower and resources cannot keep up with the cartel's 
burgeoning activities. 
</P>
<P>
Before Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela was well known, DEA agents documented a 
cocaine trafficking trip he made in 1981 to Los Angeles, where he was later 
indicted in federal court. He also has been indicted on drug-trafficking 
charges in New York, Miami and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in Spain in November, 1984, using a false Venezuelan passport. 
Also arrested was his traveling companion, Jorge Luis Ochoa, a leader of the 
Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The United States tried to extradite both Rodriguez Orejuela and Ochoa, but 
competing extradition requests from Colombia were honored by the Spanish judge 
who heard the case. Allegations that the judge took a bribe later sparked a 
scandal in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa was released without trial in Colombia, causing another scandal, but 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela was tried on his home turf, Cali, along with 
Santacruz Londono. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Navas, who served as prosecutor late in that case, said the charges 
against Rodriguez Orejuela were hastily concocted to keep him from being 
extradited by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"That business wounds the dignity of this country," Navas said. He said he 
believes that bribes were paid in the case -- "many bribes, I have no doubt" -- 
but he added that he had no proof. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge refused to consider evidence submitted by the DEA from cases in 
New York and Los Angeles. Rodriguez Orejuela and Santacruz Londono were 
acquitted, and the Colombian Supreme Court is now considering a government 
appeal in the Rodriguez Orejuela case. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the appeal, Rodriguez Orejuela is free of charges in Colombia, as is 
Santacruz Londono. Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela and other major members of the 
Cali cartel have never been charged with trafficking here. 
</P>
<P>
They circulate freely in Cali, and police leave them alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no arrest order," said Col. Rosso Navarro, metropolitan police chief. 
"If there were proof, we would have moved against them." 
</P>
<P>
Colombia has invalidated a 1979 extradition treaty with the United States, so 
cartel leaders are currently not threatened by U.S. charges against them. 
Nevertheless, the gentlemen traffickers are not at ease. When they move around 
their city, they do so under heavy security because of a blood feud with the 
Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half of the so-called War of the Cartels has cost dozens of lives 
on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police tally, the Medellin cartel has dynamited 47 drugstores in 
the Drogas La Rebaja chain owned by the Rodriguez Orejuelas. In some of the 
bombings, innocent employees and bystanders have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Six radio stations in the Grupo Radial Colombiano network have been bombed. A 
friend of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela said the family has sold the radio 
network to broadcast evangelists for $9 million but cannot find a buyer for the 
drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would buy them?" the friend asked. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators and analysts have different theories on the cause of the war 
between the two cartels, which used to cooperate. Some say it is a fight over 
cocaine markets in the United States. Others say it has grown from successive 
betrayals -- members of one cartel informing to law enforcement officials 
against the other. 
</P>
<P>
But most observers agree that it is a power struggle between two greedy groups 
that are natural rivals in the same immensely profitable business. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties have been low-ranking cartel soldiers, and little of the 
violence has taken place in Cali, where the hometown traffickers have a tight 
security system with hundreds of bodyguards. But in February, Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela's chief of security was shot to death on a downtown Cali 
street. 
</P>
<P>
And so the mannerly camouflage of the Cali cartel is coming unraveled. In 
Ciudad Jardin, Spanish for Garden City, there is a disturbing new reminder of 
the cartel's sinister presence: the crumbling ruins of a large corner house 
destroyed by a mysterious bomb several weeks ago.

A shipping company and a tanker captain pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal 
charges of causing a 300,000-gallon oil spill off Rhode Island in June and 
agreed to pay fines totaling more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard Shipping Co., a Liberian-registered firm operating in Piraeus, Greece, 
agreed to pay $500,000 to the state for environmental research. The captain, 
Iakovos Georgudis, a Greek citizen, agreed to a $10,000 fine. Each pleaded 
guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Ernest Torres conditionally accepted the pleas pending his 
review of the case. He set sentencing for Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the mouth of Narragansett 
Bay off Newport when the tanker World Prodigy ran aground on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Lincoln Almond said he did not press for harsher penalties because 
the spill resulted from simple negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The captain could have received a year in jail and a penalty equal to twice the 
amount of the damage. The Coast Guard has estimated the cleanup cost alone at 
$2 million.

POPULAR GENERIC DRUGS FACE FDA TESTING

The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it is conducting 
comprehensive tests of the 30 most-prescribed generic drugs and their patented 
counterparts following allegations that pharmaceutical companies provided false 
test data. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it expects to analyze more than 1,000 samples from hundreds of 
companies for potency, rate of dissolution in the body and chemical composition 
because of recent revelations that some companies falsified required test data 
to win approval to sell their generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed disclosure that the agency's governmental parent, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, had streamlined procedures to deal 
with serious violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
</P>
<P>
Samples will be collected from all manufacturers and private-label distributors 
of the 30 drugs, the agency reported. About half are already in hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recalls if Necessary 
</P>
<P>
The tests, which began Monday, may take several weeks, and "if any safety 
problem arises in either a generic or brand-name product, an announcement and 
recall will be promptly made," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The 30 generic drugs being tested cover about three-fourths of new 
prescriptions for generics, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The department's inspector general has been given authority to investigate 
violations, something the FDA previously handled itself. If the inspector 
general suspects that a felony has been committed, he can get in touch with the 
appropriate U.S. attorney directly, spokeswoman Judy Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, executives of three generic drug companies and three FDA chemists have 
pleaded guilty to an assortment of illegal gratuity charges. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has been under pressure from Capitol Hill, especially the House Energy 
and Commerce investigations subcommittee chaired by Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.) to clean up the generic drug division. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's investigators were the first to uncover the problems at the FDA 
division and turned their information over to the U.S. attorney's office in 
Baltimore, which is continuing to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Prescription drugs must undergo grueling tests ending in human trials to prove 
that they are safe and effective before they can be sold. New drugs are 
patented, and may be sold only by the holder of the patent, a temporary 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
When patents expire, any company is free to make the drug, and several 
companies frequently will compete to sell the same product, which pushes down 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The agency requires simpler tests to approve the unpatented generic drugs, a 
showing that the generic drug has the same biological activity as the patented 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies reportedly have substituted the patented drug for the generic 
drug in these tests, winding up with a test of the patented drug against 
itself, almost a guarantee of equivalent biological activity.

LEFT-WING UNIONS PROVE TOUGH ADVERSARY FOR PERU'S MAOIST GUERRILLA MOVEMENT

<P>
The most radical left-wing labor movement in Latin America is proving to be one 
of the few successful weapons in Peru's struggle against the Maoist guerrilla 
group known as Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels have scored advances on other fronts against a weak government and 
fragmented society. But in bitter and sometimes bloody conflict, the unions 
have so far fended off Sendero Luminoso's two-year attempt to infiltrate and 
seize control of organized labor, according to Peruvian analysts and union 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that the trade unions and other groups in Peru's democratic left 
form the popular front line against Sendero, parrying its challenge to win over 
grass-roots organizations that are built on leftist sympathies but committed to 
democratic methods. 
</P>

For the well-entrenched democratic left, Sendero's threat is immediate and 
real. Having failed to take over the unions, the rebels have switched to 
coercion and terror, targeting the left as often as they do the government and 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
At least 51 union leaders, representing Latin America's most radical left-wing 
labor movement, have been slain by Sendero so far this year. Leftist political 
parties, peasant groups and student movements have also become victims of 
Sendero violence. Despite the losses, the groups have largely withstood the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the unions are under attack by the centrist government and 
conservative business leaders, who accuse them of helping the insurgency by 
carrying out strikes and making other demands during Peru's worst economic 
crisis. The police regularly break up union protests, and alleged right-wing 
death squads are said to have begun targeting union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Given their success in denying Sendero any support on the left, many union 
leaders argue that the government campaign is dangerously counterproductive. 
Undermining the unions and imprecisely branding them part of the terrorist 
movement, they say, risks alienating those still on the side of democracy who 
are themselves terrorized by the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only True Communist Force 
</P>
<P>
Sendero regards itself as the only true Communist force in Peru. It dismisses 
the rest of the left as "revisionist." At least 14,000 people have been killed 
in Sendero's nine-year war to overthrow the political and social order and 
impose an authoritarian Maoist system. 
</P>
<P>
The movement emerged in the highlands in 1980 and in its early years 
concentrated on rural areas, but in 1987 and 1988 it expanded to the cities, 
principally Lima, the capital. The goal was to seize control of unions, student 
groups and other social organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sendero Luminoso tried to infiltrate us, but they are able to advance only 
where there is no organized left," said Pablo Checa, vice president of the 
General Confederation of Labor of Peru and a member of the traditional 
Communist Party. "When Sendero Luminoso encounters the opposition of the 
masses, they find it much more difficult. And that has happened in the worker 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Sendero Luminoso captured the leadership of five unions last year. I won't 
identify them. But by the start of this year, they had lost them all. The 
people threw them out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Anonymous Threats' 
</P>
<P>
Such setbacks prompted the guerrillas to switch to terror and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received anonymous threats, phone calls saying that we must withdraw 
or they will act 'without contemplation' -- that they will kill us," said Pedro 
Huillca, general secretary of the 300,000-member construction workers' union, 
the largest in Peru. "Sometimes the threats come in envelopes. But if we enter 
into fear, then they have won." 
</P>
<P>
The construction workers' union launched a national strike in July, demanding 
better pay but also a range of public works projects to provide jobs in an 
industry that, like most in Peru, has withered by 30% since austerity measures 
began in September. 
</P>
<P>
Other strikes, by medical workers, electrical workers and a host of smaller 
unions, has brought the total number of strikers to about 800,000 so far this 
year, or a third of the work force. Most strikes aim to recoup some of the 50% 
in lost buying power brought on by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The strikes have resulted in unprecedented government pressure on the unions, 
including the accusation that strikes amount to economic terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Huillca led a strikers' march through downtown Lima in mid-July that ended with 
the police firing on the strikers, killing a union member. Huillca said: "We 
are between two fires, the repression and Sendero Luminoso." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Strike 
</P>
<P>
Saul Cantoral, the leader of the miners' union, was slain in February in Lima 
in the course of a bitter 84-day strike. Many union leaders believe that his 
death was the work of a right-wing death squad. 
</P>
<P>
Huillca agrees that the right wing probably killed Cantoral, but he said the 
guerrillas may have done the killing "because the mining strike displaced 
Sendero Luminoso. . . . It showed that the struggle is not through terrorism 
but through the unions." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Rospigliosi, a political analyst at the Center for Peruvian Studies, 
said Sendero has entered a new phase in which all leftist organizations suffer 
from its brutality. Between 30 and 35 members of the leftist Unified 
Mariateguista Party (PUM) and several Communist Party members have been killed 
in recent months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted, the left is being undermined by the government. In 
February, eight peasant leaders of the PUM, leading a rice growers' strike, 
were shot and killed in a rural protest. Forty-three workers have been blinded 
by police buckshot during demonstrations, the labor federation says. 
</P>
<P>
Such tactics prevent the formation of a logical alliance between the centrist 
government and the democratic left in countering Sendero. Such an alliance has 
proved to be effective in the southwestern city of Puno. There the population 
worked with the police to track down and eliminate a rebel column that had 
killed an elected leftist mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employed Open Terror 
</P>
<P>
During the mining strike, Sendero employed open terror, killing five union 
activists, including one who was assassinated on the podium during a union 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"Sendero Luminoso doesn't advance because it has won the hearts of the people," 
Rospigliosi said, "but because it has terrorized them. People know that the 
police can't defend them." 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of leftist and union opposition, Sendero's one-day "armed 
strike" in late July failed to paralyze the Peruvian capital. Although many 
buses were idle, workers streamed to their jobs on foot, defying the strike 
call. 
</P>
<P>
In such armed strikes, whole regions are often shut down for a day or more. The 
order filters down from an invisible command structure, and those who defy the 
strike call risk being executed. 
</P>
<P>
Compliance is greatest in poor rural areas, where the left is not well 
organized and the military is inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Mujica, an adviser to several major trade unions, said that where 
Sendero has attempted to infiltrate unions, "they found the space already 
occupied, so they used a terrorist approach, and it was counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"The union movement was jealous of its democratic traditions, its assemblies, 
congresses," he said. "Sendero Luminoso tried to interrupt that process, with 
its authoritarian, vertical approach -- that workers must fall in line with the 
leaders. The workers were not just indifferent, they rejected it outright." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Braking Force 
</P>
<P>
Mujica said the left "is the only force that can act as a brake on Sendero 
Luminoso in this country" and added, "The only way to avoid a total 
militarization in this country is through the left." 
</P>
<P>
Unions remain fragmented -- employees of the state electricity company, for 
example, are represented by 11 unions -- and small shops cannot be unionized 
because those with fewer than 20 employees are exempt. For that reason, the 
unionized work force numbers just 1.5 million out of about 7 million employable 
people, more than half of whom are peasants or self-employed, mainly as street 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
The labor federation wants one-year contracts negotiated on an industrywide 
basis, but the mining industry and others have refused to give in on this 
demand. Sendero seeks three-month contracts, which Mujica said "would amount to 
a permanent strike." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Sendero's infiltration effort has taken place on the strategic Central 
Highway, which runs through an industrial zone between coastal Lima and the 
Andes Mountains. In factories and shantytowns the organized democratic left, in 
some cases armed through self-defense committees, has answered the Sendero 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the development of self-government by the masses, to organize the 
people democratically, while Sendero Luminoso uses authoritarian methods," the 
labor confederation's Checa said. "Their mechanism of the armed strike has 
nothing to do with assemblies. They don't consult anybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terror Tactics 
</P>
<P>
Checa said Sendero's terror tactics worked against the unions in another way as 
well: "It gave the police the pretext for confusing the measures of workers' 
struggle with the measures of terrorism, and to repress us as if we were 
terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
That has emboldened the most radical labor activists at the expense of the 
traditional, relatively moderate Communist leadership in some unions. The 
younger radicals criticize Checa's federation as weak and unsupportive. 
</P>
<P>
As Jorge Quesada, Cantoral's successor as head of the mining union, put it, the 
federation is "unwilling to commit itself to the popular struggle and the 
development of the masses." 
</P>
<P>
Under Quesada, of the Mariateguista party, the union resolved to call another 
national strike starting Aug. 14, only a few months after the previous strike 
that cost Peru about $300 million in lost export earnings. The union is more 
radical than ever after the leadership shake-up caused by Cantoral's death. 
</P>
<P>
"But we do not accept that political ideas can be imposed on us," Quesada said, 
as when Sendero "imposes armed strikes and then uses terrorism against those 
who resist."

11 ARRESTED IN MEXICO OVER YUCATAN FIRES

Eleven people have been arrested on charges they set fires that scorched 
370,000 acres of jungle in southeastern Mexico, according to the attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
The group started a number of fires in the state of Quintana Roo "for the 
purpose of exploiting lumber resources and creating areas for cultivation and 
uncontrolled human settlements," the office said in a communique released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Residents near one of the fires told authorities they saw two of the suspects 
pour gasoline across a wide area of jungle, then set it ablaze, according to 
the communique. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fires Moved Slowly 
</P>
<P>
The fires advanced slowly through the jungle for five months until rain 
extinguished them in early August. 
</P>
<P>
Dry wood and other forest litter from Hurricane Gilbert last September combined 
with the late start of the rainy season to help spread the fires, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican and foreign experts estimate that recovery of the jungle will take more 
than 30 years, a spokesman for the Group of 100 Artists and Intellectuals, an 
ecological organization in Mexico, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 11 were arrested in Mexico City, two in the state of Quintana Roo 
and one in the state of Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought to Cultivate Land 
</P>
<P>
With 30 others, they had taken over land in Campeche state, which is also 
located in the southeast, and set fire to it to open land for cultivation, the 
attorney general's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to control the blaze, they fled to Quintana Roo in late March, the 
office added. 
</P>
<P>
They were charged with property damage, carrying weapons without a license, 
criminal association and violation of forestry and ecological protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
The communique said some of those arrested Monday have been involved in fires 
and illegal land dealings on Ajusco, a mountain at the southern edge of the 
capital of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those arrested were also wanted for various homicides in Mexico City, 
the communique added.

information from military and industrial computers worldwide were indicted on 
espionage charges, prosecutors said in Frankfurt. Bonn called the breakup of 
the spy ring, which gave the KGB secret data from 12 countries, including the 
United States, "a major blow" to the Soviets.

Israeli officials are depriving the 700,000 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza 
Strip of adequate medical care as an additional means of battling the Arab 
uprising, a group of doctors charged. Members of the group -- the Assn. of 
Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights -- said at a news 
conference that indifference by Israeli authorities and political obstacles 
also have led to poor medical care in the territories. The group cited a severe 
shortage of doctors -- one per 1,400 residents in Gaza, compared to one per 400 
residents in Israel. The military government's chief medical officer in Gaza 
denied the charges.

Left-wing rebels trying to overthrow the government of Sri Lanka set fire to 
six official buildings during 24 hours of violence in which 21 people were 
killed. A government statement said 12 civilians, five security people and four 
rebels died in separate incidents. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's foreign minister, 
Ranjan Wijeratne, said India is investigating an alleged massacre of Tamils by 
Indian troops who are in the island nation to try to end a Tamil rebellion. 
Tamil rebels and residents of Valvettiturai, in northern Sri Lanka, said scores 
died when Indian troops went on a rampage after being ambushed Aug. 2 by 
rebels.

DUARTE RETURNS AID FUNDS

El Salvador's former president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, has returned $113,200 to 
the nation's treasury that the Finance Ministry contends was money intended to 
aid victims of a 1986 earthquake, according to a top-ranking member of the 
Christian Democratic Party, of which Duarte was a member. "Indeed, the former 
president deposited that sum in the nation's treasury, through his attorney 
Pablo Mauricio Alvergue," said Eduardo Colindres. The government-run daily 
newspaper El Diario de Hoy confirmed the repayment. On July 7, the Finance 
Ministry filed a legal demand against Duarte, saying he embezzled the money.

A U.S. Air Force plane carrying forensic experts, medical equipment and nine 
coffins arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to retrieve the bodies of Rep. Mickey 
Leland (D-Tex.) and eight other Americans killed in an Aug. 7 plane crash. An 
American official said it would probably take several days to identify the 
remains, which were recovered Tuesday from the crash site in rough terrain in 
western Ethiopia. Leland and the others were en route to visit a refugee camp 
when their twin-engine plane crashed in poor weather. Seven Ethiopians also 
were killed.

Frustrated in attempts to find the cause of the Sioux City, Iowa, crash on July 
19 that killed 111 people aboard United Airlines Flight 232, the National 
Transportation Safety Board is "fairly certain" to recommend more frequent and 
more thorough inspections of all DC-10 engines, ABC News reported. Nothing in 
the records for the engine and the plane showed any problems or violations of 
maintenance regulations, according to the network. Engines on two other DC-10 
passenger jets have suffered explosive failure in the past month.

Mendocino County two days after stabbing his girlfriend's sister to death in 
her Walnut Creek home. Kendall Dean Ramsel's body, found 200 feet below a 
bridge, was identified by fingerprints and a short suicide note, according to 
investigators. Walnut Creek Police Lt. Ross Sutton said officers have no idea 
why Ramsel apparently stabbed Laura Wang, 23, to death before taking his own

Defining politics as "the ability to decide who gets how much of what, when and 
where," Congressional Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy (D-D.C.) urged blacks to work 
within both major political parties to accomplish their goals rather than 
concentrating all their energies and loyalties on one party. Fauntroy, a 
non-voting delegate from the District of Columbia, addressed the annual 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference during a panel discussion in Atlanta. 
"We must adhere to our permanent political principles, not to any permanent 
political parties," Fauntroy said.

New York state's highest court, the State Court of Appeals, agreed to hear the 
appeals of three white men -- Scott Kern, Jon Lester and Jason Ladone -- 
convicted in the 1986 Howard Beach attack, in which a black man fleeing a group 
of whites was hit by a car and killed. Kern and Lester, both 20, and Ladone, 
18, were convicted in 1987 of 2nd-degree manslaughter and 1st-degree assault 
for attacking three black men in the Howard Beach section of the New York City 
borough of Queens. One of the black men, 23-year-old Michael Griffith, was 
struck by a car and killed as he fled. Another man, Cedric Sandiford, was 
beaten with tree limbs and a baseball bat.

Almost 125 years after Chief Red Cloud refused to sign a treaty with the 
federal government to allow a road to pass through Oglala Sioux territory, the 
Pine Ridge Reservation will get its first traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pine Ridge reservation will remain the land of Chief Red Cloud, but it 
will have a stoplight," Mayor G. Wayne Tapio said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The light will be placed in the center of Pine Ridge at Highways 407 and 18. 
The village, in the southwestern part of the state, has a population of 5,000. 
Tapio said that traffic passing through from outlying communities "makes rush 
hour risky."

China has suspended participation in the prestigious Fulbright program, 
forbidding an exchange of American professors and Chinese scholars in the wake 
of strained relations between the two nations over China's internal crackdown, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ware, chairman of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, said China told 
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that "no American Fulbright professors would be 
permitted to teach in China and that no Chinese graduate students or research 
scholars would be allowed to travel to the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Ware said that in recent years, the China Fulbright program has been one of the 
largest in the world, with 24 American professors and a similar number of 
Chinese scholars participating. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 American professors assigned to China will be offered Fulbright teaching 
posts in other countries that have not been chosen yet, said W. B. Reinckens of 
the U.S. Information Agency.

DUTCH COURT ORDERS RETURN OF TOXIC WASTE TO OWNERS

A Dutch court Wednesday ordered toxic zinc waste turned away by Brazil in July 
returned to its original owners in Belgium, Italy and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
A Rotterdam court ruled the Dutch firm Magnus International must remove the 
2,000 tons of toxic waste from the Dutch port where it has been stored after 
environmentalists and Brazilian officials prevented its disposal in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the firm would be fined $50,000 a day if it did not remove the 
dangerous chemicals within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was a victory for the Dutch Environment Ministry, which appealed to 
the court to have the waste removed. 
</P>
<P>
Magnus shipped 1,000 metric tons of toxic waste from Denmark and Belgium to 
Brazil in June. But the ship, the Pro Americana, was forced to return to 
Rotterdam after Brazilian authorities refused it entry, saying it carried 
chemicals the importer was not licensed to process.

Japan's new prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, won 46.5% support in an opinion 
poll, one of the lowest ratings for an incoming premier but far above that for 
his ill-fated predecessor, Sosuke Uno, the newspaper Tokyo Shimbun reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Uno started his brief term with only 35.5% support in the polls and resigned 68 
days later, taking responsibility for the Liberal Democratic Party's 
humiliating defeat in July upper house elections and discredited by allegations 
that he paid a geisha for sex.

MARINE OFFENSIVE DESTROYS CHUGIAK IN LEGION REGIONAL;

THIRD BASEMAN COLLECTS 5 HITS TO LEAD WOODLAND HILLS WEST TO 20-2 WIN OVER 
ALASKA ENTRY

<P>
It was hardly a mundane 24 hours for thick-skinned Del Marine of Woodland Hills 
West, who practically needed leatherneck-like resolve to survive the first day 
of the American Legion Northwest regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving safely enough Tuesday night, Marine engaged in a wrestling match 
at the hotel with burly teammate Jason Mitchell -- all 6-foot-3, 230 pounds of 
him. Marine managed to escape with a purple mouse under his left eye and a 
couple of strawberry-colored rug burns. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a first-round tournament game Wednesday afternoon, Marine booted his 
first fielding chance at third base, allowing Chugiak, Alaska, to score two 
unearned runs in the second inning. An hour or so later, when catcher Bobby Kim 
jammed his left thumb, Marine was drafted into service behind the plate. In the 
seventh inning, Marine was temporarily felled after slamming chest-first into a 
cement wall while trying to chase down a popup at the backstop screen. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, during his last at-bat in the bottom of the eighth, even the home 
plate umpire conspired against him, calling strike two on a pitch that seemed a 
bit high. The umpire mentioned something about wanting to "end the game and go 
home," Marine said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine's reaction? He laughed, then drilled an 0-and-2 pitch into center field 
for his fifth hit of the day and his fourth run batted in as West routed 
Chugiak, 20-2, at Lewis Clark State College. West (31-5) will play the winner 
of Wednesday night's game between host Lewis-Clark and Billings, Mont., tonight 
at 7:35. 
</P>
<P>
Marine, who entered the playoffs with a team-high .440 batting average and 40 
RBIs, went five for seven and scored three runs. By the time the 3-hour, 
17-minute game finally ended, a grubby Marine looked like he had just slithered 
out of the nearby Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a routine 24 hours," West Coach Gary Gibson said as he gave Marine a few 
good whacks between the shoulder blades. "He's been our best hitter all year, 
and now you see why." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Marine was hardly the only guy doing serious damage, although all it would 
have taken to beat Chugiak (23-33) was a few good men. West pounded out 20 hits 
and everyone but pitcher Pat Treend, today's probable starting pitcher, made an 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Chugiak used four pitchers and West scored at least two runs off each. Coach 
Dave Richardson started pitcher Kyle Linn (3-3) on a hunch, figuring that the 
left-hander's off-speed arsenal would keep West guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"You can time his fastball with a sundial," Richardson said of Linn, who wears 
uniform No. 60 and throws about as fast. "But they probably haven't seen too 
much of that kind of off-speed stuff where they come from." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle's guile lasted all of 1 2/3 innings, by which time he already had 
surrendered a first-inning grand slam to outfielder Carl McFadden as West took 
a 9-2 lead after two innings. Linn's offerings looked finger-lickin' good to 
most of the West batters. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been hitting the off-speed stuff too well lately," said McFadden, who 
nearly hit another grand slam in the second when a similar blast to left peeled 
off foul. "But I got some licks in today." 
</P>
<P>
West right-hander Lance Gibson (11-2) pitched six innings and allowed two 
unearned runs on seven hits. With his split-fingered fastball diving through 
the lower half of the strike zone, Gibson struck out 10, walked one and yielded 
just one fly-ball out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real crazy about some of their hits," said Gibson, who gave up four 
hits -- one a blooper and one a bunt -- in the second inning as Chugiak closed 
to within 5-2. "They were just dropping in all over. But my curve and 
split-finger were really working." 
</P>
<P>
Chugiak continued the trend on defense, dropping about every other ball that 
West put in play. Chugiak finished with precisely as many errors as hits 
(eight). It could have been worse: West scored in every inning but the third 
and fourth and stranded 15 baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Marine said that arriving in time for the tournament opener between highly 
regarded Vancouver, Wash., and Cody, Wyo., helped give the team a jump start. 
Despite entering the tournament with a record of 24-28, Cody beat Vancouver, 
4-3. Vancouver fell to 42-19. 
</P>
<P>
"We really tried not to come out here flat, to make sure we didn't get blown 
out of there in the first round, too," said Marine in reference to the 
Vancouver upset.

'CHARACTER -- THAT'S WHAT WE WANT';

DOMINGUEZ HILLS SOCCER COACH SEES ATTITUDE AS KEY TO WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marine Cano stood on a soccer field at Alta Vista Park in Redondo Beach the 
other day, exhorting youthful followers at one of his summer soccer camps to be 
the best they can be. 
</P>
<P>
"Character. That's what we want," he told a hundred boys and girls. "Let's see 
what kind of character you have." 
</P>
<P>
Cano, the feisty men's and women's soccer coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
also sees that attitude playing a major role in the Toros' intercollegiate 
chances this fall. Both teams return fine players with the potential to produce 
a pair of the school's best seasons. And as Cano sees it, the only thing that 
will hurt either group is a poor mental attitude. "If we live up to our 
potential, we'll do OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are coaches who prod. Others coerce. Then there is Cano, who applies the 
screws early. In front of his young soccer charges at Alta Vista, Cano 
introduced several Toro players working for the camp by saying that they were 
going to be the best in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure? Sure. As a professional goalie Cano thrived on it. The 34-year-old 
Redondo Beach resident, unlike most coaches who play down their team's chances 
this early in a season, Cano thinks truth is the best test. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't set my goals high, how are we going to achieve anything?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Character, then, will be the operative word this fall at the Carson campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Mediocrity doesn't set well with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, both teams appear to be strong. Following scrimmages with a powerful 
women's club team and the men from UCLA on Wednesday, Cano will know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
The Toro men, 1988 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. co-champion, return all 
11 starters for its Sept. 1 opener at Biola University. Eight starters return 
for the women, including seven seniors. Nine top-flight newcomers also join the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of scary after this year to think what it will be like without 
them," Cano said about the players in their final years. 
</P>
<P>
Cano has already had a small taste of losing. His women's assistant coach, Bill 
Merrell, left recently to reassume the head job at UC Berkeley. Merrell hired 
another Cano assistant, Andy Bonchonsky, to be his assistant at Cal. No 
replacements for them have been found. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm big on quality and right now with no assistant coach I'm looking (for 
someone)," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the women's program (8-7-4 in '88) is probably Cano's stronger, posing a 
mixture of defensive prowess, strength and speed as it works toward its season 
opener Sept. 2 against Lady Toro alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Of the midfield play consisting mainly of Kristi White, Jeanine Charroux and 
freshman Jennifer Grasso, Cano says, "It is possibly the best in the nation, 
Division I or II." Grasso, a celebrated high school player from Chula Vista, 
could be one of the top goal scorers in the nation, Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
Four players are battling senior Conni Cowman, a transfer from El Camino, and 
Deonna Collins, a freshman from Corona del Mar, for backfield spots. 
</P>
<P>
Sweepers Mandi Robertson (Huntington Beach) and Laura Moses (Torrance) return, 
as does middle stopper Donna Robertson (Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
A question mark is Lynor Johnson, who Cano says "has the potential to score 20 
goals" this season. Johnson, according to the coach, is a "blue-collar worker" 
who can change the nature of the game if she wants to. But it's unclear as to 
whether the senior forward from Redondo Beach will crack the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very strong team, a good base with 12 returning players and nine 
newcomers," Cano said. "We have seasoned veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Women's soccer teams do not compete in athletic conferences, but Cano expects 
three teams from the West to be selected for the NCAA Division II playoffs. 
However, competition nationwide is much better this season and "anything 
resembling a record like we had last year will not (get you into the 
playoffs)," Cano said. Defending national champion Cal State Hayward and No. 3 
Sonoma State are on the Lady Toro schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Toro men surprised a few people when they tied Cal State Northridge for the 
CCAA title last season, posting a 13-5-1 overall record. 
</P>
<P>
"Last season we did unexpectedly well," Cano said. "This year the boys must 
realize that they are a very good team, but that doesn't mean we can just show 
up . . . . There are other very good teams out there." 
</P>
<P>
Cano hopes to crank up the scoring machine. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be very offensive. We will be looking to score a lot of goals." 
</P>
<P>
To facilitate more firepower, the Toros will experiment with only three 
defensemen instead of four. Cano hopes that will free the shooting touch of 
players like Kaveh Rezagahi (a naturalized citizen from Iran who has not played 
in college), Willie Ayala (El Salvador) and Joe Flanagan (Torrance), who is 
eight goals shy of setting a school scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
But playing only three defenders may put added pressure on goalie Chris Wilson, 
a senior from Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cano: "I expect good things from him." 
</P>
<P>
In the midfield area Cano is looking over "six guys who can start." Martin Mira 
(San Pedro) is expected to be a sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cano, who begins his sixth season, Dominguez Hills has always had 
competitive teams, although coaching two teams simultaneously has kept him 
busy. Now, with playoff prospects looking bright, Cano could face a few 
additional weeks of double duty, hectically scrambling from one practice field 
to the other on the same day to coach both clubs. 
</P>
<P>
A schedule like that is enough to test anyone's character.

THE GIRL BATS CLEANUP; 
</P>
<P>
BEFORE THE GAME IS OVER, VICTORIA BRUCKER OF THE EASTVIEW ALL-STARS WILL EVEN 
HAVE LITTLE LEAGUE PURISTS ON HER SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Gary Sloan had just rounded the bases after hitting a first-inning home run 
Monday night in a Western Regional Little League playoff game when his 
teammate, the cleanup hitter for the Eastview Little League All-Stars of San 
Pedro, stepped into the batters box. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Brucker dug in and felt every eye in the crowd of 6,500 spectators at 
Al Houghton Stadium in San Bernardino upon her. 
</P>
<P>
Brucker, the only girl on the field, tugged at shoulder-length black hair 
protruding from a batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Behind a guardrail at the top row of the 8,000-seat stadium, a group of 
old-timers couldn't believe what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that guy's hair," said one. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, my grandson's wearin' it long like that," responded another. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, guys, that's not a guy. It's a girl," said a third. 
</P>
<P>
"A girl?," responded the first. "What's this world coming to?" 
</P>
<P>
Brucker, a student at Dodson Junior High School, was too far removed from the 
group to hear. But she has heard it all before, ever since she eschewed 
softball in favor of baseball five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the plate, as she glared at the pitcher for the Alaskan All-Stars, the 
power-hitting first baseman had only one thought: "Sloan just took the lead in 
team home runs away from me and I want it back." 
</P>
<P>
Then she hit a 1-0 pitch over the scoreboard in right field for a towering home 
run to the delight of just about everybody, including the old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
As Brucker rounded the bases to cheers from the crowd, one of the gadflies 
remarked: "Whew. So much for the weaker sex." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the evening Brucker had won the hearts of every doubter. She went 
three-for-three with a pair of walks, scored four times, drove in a pair of 
runs and played flawlessly at first base as Eastview routed Alaska, 18-6. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan and Brucker teamed up for another round of back-to-back homers in the 
sixth inning Monday. Each has eight to help Eastview (13-1) advance to the 
quarterfinals of the Western Regional tonight at 8 against the all-stars from 
Oregon. The winner of this single-elimination tournament advances to the Little 
League World Series at Williamsport, Pa., next week. 
</P>
<P>
Brucker is not the first girl to play in this tournament (the Hawaiian 
All-Stars have a girl this year), but she is the only one to hit a ball out of 
the park in the 19-year history of Houghton. Her second shot, another solo home 
run to dead center, traveled at least 270 feet, well past the 200-foot fences. 
She is also 3-0 as a pitcher and may take the mound tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Graves, a volunteer representative from Little League who has umpired in 
the World Series, called Brucker "the best girl (player) I've seen in 25 years. 
She's a very exciting ballplayer regardless of her sex." 
</P>
<P>
A tall, attractive 12-year-old with darting brown eyes, Victoria doesn't seem 
affected by the growing attention to a girl in a baseball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just one of the players," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, it is a growing entourage of supporters and teammates who are most 
affected. Eastview President Gary Miley points out that "my concern is how will 
the rest of the guys take" the attention she is getting. 
</P>
<P>
Graves estimated that every time Eastview plays, an additional thousand people 
show up to watch Brucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicky is definitely the story here, but this is a very, very balanced team," 
he cautioned. "She isn't a one-person team, but she is very much a crucial 
element." 
</P>
<P>
Six players return from last year's team that advanced to the championship game 
of the Southern California Sectional tournament. This year Eastview has 
averaged 12.6 runs a game. Pitchers Tim Harper and Steve Williams are both 4-0. 
Sloan and utility Chris Hevener hit with power. Sloan has an accurate arm from 
center field. Mike Lennox has filled a gap in the outfield and at first base. 
The defense has been anchored by right-fielder Angel Quintero, catcher Ryan 
Albano, left-fielder Joe Sulentor and second baseman Iggie Galaz, a sure-handed 
gloveman. Joey Danelo, James Ditch, Anthony Pesusich and James Santos come off 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"They play well together," Eastview Manager Joe Dileva said. "These guys take 
turns helping us." 
</P>
<P>
Dileva is assisted by coaches Nick Lusic and Mark Grgas. 
</P>
<P>
To her teammates, Victoria has become just another player, but it wasn't always 
that way. She made the Eastview All-Stars as an 11-year-old a year ago but 
played sparingly in the playoffs. Miley noticed that something wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
"The other players shied away from her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a difficult time for Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
Said Victoria's mother, Elizabeth Roderick: "That's when the questions started. 
She cried and cried. She felt bad about it. She would ask me, 'Why mom? Why 
can't girls play with boys?' " 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth reminded her daughter what both realized early in life: Victoria has 
to prove herself every time she takes the field. 
</P>
<P>
"When she first started playing, one parent, a man, told me to my face that I 
should take Victoria home and teach her to cook and clean," said Elizabeth, a 
spirited woman. "I told him, 'She not only knows how to cook and clean, she can 
also crochet and play baseball better than your son.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miley admitted that early in her career Victoria had detractors among the 
league's parents and coaches. She was the last player taken in the draft when 
she came up to the majors, a fact Miley says most coaches regret today. 
</P>
<P>
"She has to earn (everyone's respect) all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria appears to have won over her teammates this season, although she will 
be entering the eighth grade this fall while her teammates start seventh. She 
skipped a grade in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan, Victoria's biggest admirer on the team, has been impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just one of the guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sulentor, knocked to the ground by Brucker in a collision at home plate this 
season, has let bygones be bygones: "She acts like a boy on the field. She does 
what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Roderick, Victoria's stepfather, calls the home run battle between Sloan 
and Brucker "an unofficial rivalry." He attributed her extraordinary strength 
and build to five years of competitive swimming at the San Pedro Peninsula 
YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
"When she was 3 she was crossing back and forth in the pool," Elizabeth added. 
</P>
<P>
Rick and Elizabeth Roderick have been married about eight years and are raising 
four children. Victoria's father, Dave Brucker, and Elizabeth were divorced 
when Victoria was 2. 
</P>
<P>
As strong as she is, can Brucker continue to play against boys as she matures? 
She'll move up to Senior Little League next season against players three years 
older. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a South Bay parochial high school has inquired about her services, and 
if she grows taller her future could be bright. 
</P>
<P>
"She's done well here and there's no reason to believe she won't do well 
(elsewhere)," Miley said. 
</P>
<P>
Brucker is adamant about playing baseball as far as she can, despite the fact 
her size and power lend themselves to a career as a formidable softball 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd rather play baseball than eat," said Rick Roderick. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth, who has a younger daughter, Veronica, in softball, wishes her oldest 
daughter well: "Victoria doesn't want to stop playing baseball and I don't want 
to be her wall. I'm always afraid she might hit that wall someday, but I never 
want to be the one to say no, you have to stop playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the odds are against her making a high school varsity. 
</P>
<P>
But David Brucker, who watched his daughter play Monday, says: "By the time 
she's old enough to play, maybe women's lib will have come that far and she'll 
have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
It'll just give the old-timers more to talk about.

CLU SPRINTER BERNARD GOES ABROAD TO HEAL, TRAIN -- AND MAKE A NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Darren Bernard of Cal Lutheran has lived in the United States since 1982, but 
the former Thousand Oaks High sprinter will represent his native England in the 
World University Games later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard will run the first leg on Britain's 1,600-meter relay team that 
includes Paul Dennis of Azusa Pacific and Britons Richard Hill and Ikem Billy. 
</P>
<P>
Billy, who won the 800 meters in the British championships in Birmingham, 
England, on Sunday, is well-known on the European track and field circuit, but 
the other members of the British foursome -- which timed 3 minutes, 9 seconds 
in a qualifying race at Loughborough University in July -- are relatively 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the games in Duisburg, West Germany on Aug. 25-30 will give Dennis, 
Hill and Bernard a chance to gain valuable international exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what Paul and I came over here for," Bernard said by phone from his 
father's home in London. "We wanted to run some good times and hopefully 
qualify for the British team." 
</P>
<P>
Reaching that goal has helped ease the pain of a disappointing sophomore 
collegiate season for Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard began the season with hopes of running under 46 seconds in the 400; he 
ended it in disappointment after being eliminated in the semifinals of the 
National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics championships at Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Having run 46.65 to place fifth in the NAIA championships as a freshman, 
Bernard appeared to be on his way toward attaining his sophomore goals when he 
timed 47.11 to place second in an invitational meet at Cal State Northridge in 
early April. 
</P>
<P>
"He was right where we wanted him to be at Northridge," Cal Lutheran assistant 
Coach Doni Green said. "He was right on schedule. He looked very strong and 
relaxed there." 
</P>
<P>
But Bernard strained a tendon in his right hamstring competing in the 200 
meters later in the meet and the injury hampered him for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, who had high school bests of 10.8 in the 100, 21.9 in the 200 and 
48.25 in the 400, said that the injury still bothered him when he ventured 
overseas in June. He said it is nearly healed now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still getting it worked on," said Bernard, whose parents moved to England 
from Kingston, Jamaica, in 1954. "But it's feeling much better. I'm in shape to 
run some good times. I wasn't when I first came over here." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, who was born in a suburb of London, had no intention of moving to the 
United States, but his father encouraged him to remain here during a six-week 
vacation in the summer of 1982 when he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I was all set to go back, but he told me to stay here," said Bernard, who was 
visiting his grandmother and aunt. "He thought it would be best for me. I 
really didn't have much say in the matter." 
</P>
<P>
At Thousand Oaks, Bernard led the Lancers to a share of the Marmonte League 
title during his senior season, won the league title in the 400 and placed 
sixth in the Southern Section 4-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
He then came under the tutelage of Green, who guided Simi Valley High to eight 
consecutive Marmonte titles before coming to Cal Lutheran in the summer of 1986 
to coach alongside his father, Don. 
</P>
<P>
Doni Green was pleased to learn of Bernard's selection to the British team, but 
he is worried that his protege might race too much this summer, especially in 
light of the hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He's having fun over there and getting some experience," Green said, "But I'm 
going to make sure that he takes a nice, long rest once he gets back here. He's 
been training steadily for a year now without a rest." 
</P>
<P>
After the required R &amp; R, Bernard's winter training will be geared more 
toward the 800 than the 400 with the expectation that he will compete at 
varying distances this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably run him in both the 800 and 100 in the early part of the 
season," Green said. "That way, he'll get work on his endurance, strength and 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
Those qualities are vital ingredients in the makeup of a successful 400 runner, 
but Green has another motive: He expects Bernard to move up to the 800 in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, that may be his best race," Green said, "because he just doesn't 
have that blazing flat speed that you need to be a world-class 400 runner. At 
least, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the top 400 runners can run 20.5 or 20.6 in the 200 and 10.4 or 10.5 
in the 100, while Darren has 21.6 or 21.7 200 speed and 10.9 or 11.0 100 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that he may ultimately lack the speed required of an elite 400 man, 
Bernard has contemplated a switch to the 800 but not without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've definitely thought about it," he said. "If I don't get down to 45, I'm 
not going to be able to run in the big meets in the 400. But it (the 800) hurts 
a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have the speed for the 800. It's just a matter of getting the 
endurance background." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps lacking the proper base work last season, Bernard had some nightmarish 
experiences in the 800. Green recalled one meet in which Bernard ran the first 
400 in 54 seconds -- 1:48 pace -- only to slow to a 68 second lap for a final 
time of 2:02. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never hurt like that," Bernard recalled. "I remember saying 'Oh, my God,' 
it hurt so much. But I think the pain will get less as I get more experience in 
the 800." 
</P>
<P>
The 800 will not become Bernard's primary race for at least a couple of years, 
however. Green wants to wait until the 5-foot-9, 140-pound athlete has matured 
physically before assessing his future. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, I think he's going to have to go to the 800," Green said. "But it's 
hard to tell right now. If you look at him, he's still a kid. When he develops 
into a man -- which should happen in the next couple of years -- we'll have a 
better idea where we stand." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, who is expected to return to Cal Lutheran next month, will tune up for 
the World University Games by running in local meets for the Herne Hill 
Harriers, a London-based track club. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to run a good first leg at the games," Bernard said. "I want to 
open up with a 46 and then see what happens."

PINCAY AND CHEVAL VOLANT COME BACK FOR MORE, WIN SORRENTO STAKES

<P>
For Laffit Pincay Jr., who could see Wednesday's $75,000-added Sorrento Stakes 
slipping away from 2-year-old filly Cheval Volant, it was a time for 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
For Kenneth Jumps, Cheval Volant's trainer, it was a time to keep the faith. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Cheval Volant rewarded Pincay for his desperate action -- a 
left-handed-whip -- and Jumps for his confidence by coming back to win the 
seven-furlong race for two-year-old fillies by 1 3/4 lengths over Breezing 
Dixie at the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the lead at the half-pole, Cheval Volant gave it up to Breezing 
Dixie and trailed by 2 1/2 lengths entering the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was a beaten horse," said Pincay, who took his fourth Sorrento 
Stakes. "Luckily, she responded to the whip. She hadn't run in weeks, and she 
was getting tired, but she showed a lot of courage to come back like that." 
</P>
<P>
It was something Jumps said he knew his filly had. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she'd keep on running, plus I had Laffit up," Jumps said. "He's the 
best in the world, and when you've got him going for you on a horse that wants 
to run, that's a tough combination." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay wasn't so sure his horse could recover from her slumber. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a horse go by like that, they usually don't respond again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jumps, who owns a piece of Cheval Volant along with three others, said the 
Sept. 3 Del Mar Debutante is next up for the filly. 
</P>
<P>
Will one mile at the Debutante be a problem? 
</P>
<P>
"The way she's bred, I think the farther they go, the better," Jumps said. 
</P>
<P>
Jumps purchased Cheval Volant, or "flying horse" in French, for $67,000 at 
Calder in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"After this race, it sure looks like a bargain," Jumps said. 
</P>
<P>
The only apparent negative for Cheval Volant was the blood flowing from her 
nostrils after the finish. 
</P>
<P>
One of Cheval Volant's major challengers, D. Wayne Lukas' Rue De Palm -- who 
was sent to the post at 2-1 -- never made it out of the gate. She became feisty 
while awaiting the start and was scratched after hitting her head. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens said the incident was not totally unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a bad actor in the gate," Stevens said. "She just blew up. She froze and 
lunged into the front of the gate and hit her head pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Jamie, ridden by Russell Baze, finished a neck behind Breezing Dixie to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"She ran a big race," Baze said. "She got a little tired on me in the last 
part." 
</P>
<P>
Cheval Volant, an 8-5 favorite, paid $3.60, $3 and $2.40. Breezing Dixie paid 
$11 and $4.80, and Dancing Jamie paid $4. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ed Giammarino's The Medic, who finished seventh in an eight-horse field in 
the $275,250 Grade I Eddie Read Handicap Sunday, came out of the race with a 
fractured cannon bone and will be sidelined about six months. . . . Trainer Jay 
Robbins said he would skip the Del Mar Derby with Continental after an 
unsatisfactory workout Monday. . . . Pendleton and Royal T Stable's Music Merci 
worked a half mile in 48 1/5 under exercise rider Martin Ruiz. Music Merci, a 
3-year-old millionaire and the winner of the Del Mar Futurity, will carry a 
high weight of 122 pounds in the $200,000-added Grade II Del Mar Derby Sunday 
at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. No horse has ever swept the Del Mar Futurity and 
Derby. . . . Wednesday's Pick Six pot of $1,333,933 was a record. The 39 
winning tickets paid $28,121.60 each. . . . To make better use of the grass, 
the inside rail on the turf course at Del Mar was moved out 12 feet Tuesday on 
both turns and the stretch. The fence will be moved back again in two weeks 
after the worn grass on the inside has been refurbished.

FOR BRAD BURTON, CONTACT HURTS SO GOOD; 
</P>
<P>
SDSU DEFENSIVE TACKLE HAPPY TO HIT AFTER INFECTION RUINED '88 SEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the list of things in this world that football players are thankful for, the 
start of preseason practice in full gear under a hot summer sun is not near the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, that is, you are San Diego State defensive tackle Brad Burton. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this sounds corny, but you don't realize how much you like something 
until it is gone for a while," Burton said. "I didn't realize how much I liked 
football until there was a chance I would not play again. It really makes you 
appreciate what you have." 
</P>
<P>
That feeling struck Burton again Wednesday morning after he put on full gear 
and banged against his teammates for the first time since a frightening battle 
with a staph infection in his right ankle last fall. The infection cut short 
his junior season and almost ended his football career. 
</P>
<P>
There were days, weeks and even months when Burton, a senior from El Capitan 
High School, wondered if he would be out there again. Even now, nearly 10 
months after the first symptoms of the infection appeared, there are doubts 
about his future. Maybe that is why, while some of his teammates rued the 
beginning of full-contact drills, Burton enjoyed every minute of the two-hour 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The first practice in pads was special," Burton said. "You never really know 
how things will go until you go against a live person. Getting out there with 
the guys and being a part of everything again, that meant a lot to me. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact Burton took the field in pads does not necessarily mean he will 
play this season. His mobility remains limited because of stiffness in his 
ankle, his conditioning is slightly behind some of the other players, and there 
always is the risk the infection will return. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a day-to-day thing with him," said Ed Schmidt, the defensive line coach. 
"I don't know what the lasting effects will be, and I don't know if he knows 
either. I hope it is worth it to him to play football, because we sure would 
like to have him around." 
</P>
<P>
Burton's value to the team has never been questioned. Until the infection, he 
played much of last season with a cast covering a dislocated finger. And 
despite missing the final four games, he still was named the team's outstanding 
defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-5, 255 pounds, he is one of the most seasoned players on a line that 
the coaches have said is probably the strong point of a defense that has been 
the team's greatest weakness over the past several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to have him back because he is such a stabilizing force," Schmidt 
said. "He is a mature leader, and it is very important for this young defense 
to have a mature, intelligent person in our midst. He really is a good 
influence on the young players." 
</P>
<P>
The coaches have let Burton try to pick up where he left off. He is working 
with the first-team defense, along with junior Pio Sagapolutele, as one of two 
defensive tackles in the Aztecs' four-man front. But he is being pushed by 
senior Milt Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"He is with the first group until somebody beats him out," Schmidt said. "Let's 
just see if he can do it." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Burton is thankful just be getting the chance. His difficulties 
began in a 13-7 loss at Colorado State Oct. 22. The next week, he accompanied 
the team to Utah, but his ankle was too sore to let him to play in a 41-20 
loss. The next day, the pain became so severe, Burton checked into a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really in bad shape," Burton said. "I was in so much pain. I couldn't 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
It was then that he finally was diagnosed as having a staph infection. But that 
was only the beginning of his difficulties. Over the next two months, he would 
spend a total of 15 days in the hospital and undergo two operations to remove 
fluid and clean his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
For two months after the second operation, Burton had to inject himself with 
antibiotics every four hours through a catheter in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking maybe I won't have a senior year," Burton said. "Over time, I 
started to feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Once off the medication, his comeback was just starting. 
</P>
<P>
He missed spring practice. Swimming, running and weight training had to take 
the place of physical contact on a football field. Along the way, there were 
small setbacks, the most recent a hamstring pull that threatened to keep him 
from starting preseason practice on time. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all the problems, Burton was there when contact drills began 
Wednesday. And outside of Burton himself, no one could have been happier than 
his twin brother, Mitch. Through the months of rehabilitation and worry, Burton 
said he had no better friend and teammate than Mitch, his younger brother by 
five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was laid up for a long time, he was always there to help me," Burton 
said. "I couldn't have had a better friend." 
</P>
<P>
Mitch, who played alongside Brad at defensive end last year, has been moved 
back to his original position at tight end. But even from across the line, he 
knows his brother's value to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We were worried he wouldn't make it back, because he is such an inspiration to 
our defense," Mitch said. "There were times when he would get down, but he 
really worked through it. It's great to have him back." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Pio Sagapolutele caused an anxious moment when he went down 
after a collision screaming in pain and clutching his right knee. But it turned 
out to be only a mild knee sprain, and he is expected to return to practice 
today, trainer Brian Barry said. It was enough, however, to end the first 
scrimmage of preseason. . . . Receiver is supposed one of the Aztecs' strongest 
positions, but the team practiced without two of its best -- Robert Claiborne 
and Patrick Rowe. Rowe, a junior from Lincoln High School, has been held out of 
practice this week because of sore right knee. Claiborne, a senior from Mount 
Miguel and Southwestern Community College, pulled a hamstring Tuesday. He was 
kept him out of most of spring practice for a a similar injury. Claiborne, who 
redshirted last season because of an abundance of receivers, caught 26 passes 
for 374 yards and four touchdowns as a junior. "I can't go on potential," Coach 
Al Luginbill said. "I have got to go with who is at practice." The first-team 
receivers have been senior Monty Gilbreath and juniors Dennis Arey and Jimmy 
Raye. Also kept out of the first day of full-contact practice were defensive 
lineman Mike Alexander (hip), center Steve Blyth (knee), guard Roman Fortin 
(hips), defensive end Bob Graff (knee), offensive lineman Carson Leomiti 
(Achilles tendon), center Bonner Montler (foot), defensive lineman George 
Tuioti (knee) and linebacker Derrick Williams (groin). Fortin will need 
"extensive rehabilitation, and you have to very cautious with hip flexors or 
else they (the problem) can last a long time," Barry said. Fortin is 
questionable for Sunday's scrimmage. . . . Luginbill said he has been impressed 
with freshmen linebackers Turaj Smith of San Francisco, Dan Stehly of Orange 
Glen and Eric Thompson of Los Alamitos. Luginbill said they could be needed to 
shore up what might be the team's most inexperienced position.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SAN DIEGO'S DE LUCA TO FIGHT FOR NABF TITLE AT EL 
CORTEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's Tony (Bazooka) De Luca (15-2, six knockouts) will attempt to keep 
his career on track tonight at the El Cortez Convention Center when he fights 
Guadalajara's Willie Salazar (35-14-1, 25 knockouts) for the North American 
Boxing Federation title. 
</P>
<P>
De Luca, 27, lost in his first opportunity to win the International Boxing 
Federation flyweight title when his bout with Duke McKenzie on March 8 in 
London was stopped on cuts in the fourth round. De Luca was slightly behind on 
points when the referee ruled that the cut over his eye was too severe for him 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
On May 18, De Luca came back to knock out Jose Manuel Diaz in the fifth round 
at the El Cortez. De Luca is ranked fourth by the NABF and second by the USBA 
and the WBA in the 108-pound flyweight division. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who has held the NABF title for three years, lost his last bout in 
Guadalajara on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
The five-fight card, which is nearly a sellout, begins at 7:30 p.m. with the 
main event scheduled to begin at approximately 9:15.

Phil Mickelson of San Diego was one of two American singles winners in the 
first round of the 32nd Walker Cup at Atlanta. The Walker Cup features the top 
U.S. amateur golfers against those from Great Britain and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, who will be a sophomore at Arizona State, defeated Garth McGimpsey, 
4 and 2. Mickelson, the youngest member of the team, teamed with Danny Yates to 
halve their foursome match with McGimpsey and Stephen Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans lost five of seven singles matches and trail Britain-Ireland, 7 
1/2-4 1/2. The U.S. team has won the past eight Walker Cups and is 28-2-1 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Leta Lindley of Carlsbad shot a 74 and is one shot behind the leader after two 
rounds of the girls' 15-18 Junior Tournament of Champions at the Palm Beach

2 SOUTHLAND BUSINESSMEN TO BUY LIQUOR BARN CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego area businessmen on Wednesday said they have agreed to buy the 
68-store Liquor Barn chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to acquire the assets of the San Leandro, Calif.-based chain must 
still be approved by Liquor Barn's creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Oakland. No purchase price was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers, Lewis Silverberg, a San Diego attorney, and Harvey W. Rosen of 
Rancho Santa Fe, said in a statement that they were seeking an equity partner. 
Silverberg and Rosen were not available for further comment. Liquor Barn 
President John Thompson was also not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Problems 
</P>
<P>
A former Safeway Stores subsidiary, Liquor Barn grew into a 104-store chain 
with $332 million in sales on a no-frills, discount-price strategy. But the 
chain's financial troubles began after Safeway sold the chain in 1987 to 
London-based Majestic Wine, a small British wine retailer. Majestic hoped to 
boost sales by replacing Liquor Barn's discount image with an upscale wine 
merchant approach. Employees were trained to advise customers on wine 
selection, and periodic wine tastings were planned. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan backfired as old customers stayed away and the new, upscale 
shoppers never materialized. Industry analysts also said Majestic may have paid 
too much -- an estimated $110 million -- for a chain that never turned a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Control of Firm 
</P>
<P>
Majestic reversed its policy but was unable to attract former customers. Last 
year, Majestic lost control of Liquor Barn to American and British bankers who 
acquired 66% of the chain. 
</P>
<P>
A company turnaround would be both expensive and difficult, say industry 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
"They must try and regain the image and identity they had originally," said Max 
Kerstein, publisher of Beverage Bulletin. "They are going to have to compete 
against the heavyweights, like Price Club, that have taken the play away from 
them."

WANG SAYS IT WILL SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
STEP INTENDED TO PRESSURE LENDERS FOR NEW CREDIT

Wang Laboratories Inc. said Wednesday that it will suspend payments on $208.6 
million of institutional debts, an apparent step to give it a stronger hand in 
negotiations with its bank lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The cash-short computer giant has been trying to negotiate a new line of credit 
with a group of eight banks, led by Bank of Boston, to replace a $300-million 
credit line that expires Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
By suspending payments on the $208.6 million of commercial paper and bank 
notes, it is putting more pressure on the eight bank lenders, since those banks 
also hold some of the securities in question. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fairly straightforward that they're calling the bluff of their 
banks, playing hardball," said John W. Adams, chairman of Adams, Harkness &amp; 
Hill in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss for Year 
</P>
<P>
Wang reported a $424.3-million loss for the fiscal year that ended June 30, and 
had speeded up plans to lay off more than 2,200 workers by Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
An Wang, the founder, chief executive and chairman, has recently undergone 
treatment for cancer. Last week, in an unexpected move, his son and heir 
apparent, Frederick A. Wang, stepped down as president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Wang has $962 million in short- and long-term debt altogether and is trying to 
restructure all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Wang stock fell 50 cents a share to $6 a share on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Company Chairman An Wang said in a terse statement that the company would 
suspend principal and interest payments on certain institutional debts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Difficult 
</P>
<P>
Paul Henning, director of investor relations, said later that the freeze would 
apply to $125 million of commercial paper, as well as $83.6 million in notes 
payable to banks. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the negotiations had been "long and difficult and arduous and 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're dealing with a consortium of eight banks . . . getting nine 
parties to come to an agreement gets complex," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning stressed that the move applied only to institutional debts, and said 
the company intended to remain current on all other obligations, including 
trade credits, operating costs, vendor bills, customer service and overseas 
operations, while negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said despite those woes Wang's balance sheet at year-end was "a fairly 
strong one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Not Unprecedented 
</P>
<P>
"That, particularly as modern balance sheets go, is a pretty bankable 
situation," he said. "It doesn't reflect tremendously well on the banking group 
if, with that balance sheet, they can't put together a lending agreement and a 
loan." 
</P>
<P>
Adams added, "They sure have cast down the gauntlet." 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said Wang's action was unusual but not unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying well, we don't like the new terms and we don't have the funds 
to pay you under the old terms," said Fred Pastore, vice president with Moody's 
Investors Service in New York. But he added, "Certainly if a company can't pay 
its bills and meet the terms of its original obligation to the banks, that 
doesn't look good."

MORE EVIDENCE THAT RECESSION ISN'T NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
REPORTS SHOW GAINS IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, HOUSING STARTS 
</P>

<P>
Industrial production rose for the first time in three months in July while 
housing starts continued to rebound, the government said Wednesday in reports 
seen as further evidence that a recession will be avoided this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index last month stood at 
141.7% of its 1977 base, compared to 141.4% in June. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.2% increase in July followed consecutive declines of 0.1% in May and 
June. Overall production was up 2.7% over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 0.8% in 
July after posting declines for four consecutive months through May. They 
started to rebound with an 8.5% increase in June. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Fed reported that the factory operating rate remained 
steady at 83.6% in July, continuing to ease inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's consistent with the soft-landing scenario, modest growth without tipping 
into a recession," Thomas Holloway, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers 
Assn. of America, said of the reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Moderate Strength' 
</P>
<P>
David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Assn., said 
that several months of stagnant production at manufacturing plants had been 
causing fears of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's report "indicates that manufacturing may have bottomed out and 
we're seeing some moderate strength that should help with the soft-landing 
scenario," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has been walking a fine line between keeping interest rates high enough 
to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the economy 
slides into a recession. It began letting rates drop in June as inflation 
seemed to lessen. 
</P>
<P>
"The July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of total materials as 
well as continued strength in business equipment excluding motor vehicles," the 
central bank said Wednesday in releasing the industrial production report. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, automobile and truck production fell sharply, and output of 
construction supplies, on balance, remained weak," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods 
rose 0.2% after remaining flat in May and June. That was a 3.3% increase from 
July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Output at mines and oil wells rose 0.3% following a revised 1.1% decline in 
June caused in part by a coal strike. The July output was 3.5% lower than a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Production at utilities, reflecting increased use of air conditioning, rose 
0.8% in July, following a 1.3% decline in June. Utility production was up 1.2% 
from July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Kelleher, manager of the Community Resources Section of the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, said he was encouraged by the housing report. 
</P>
<P>
"This month's rebound in housing starts shows that the country's economic 
expansion is continuing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural Falloff 
</P>
<P>
The July level of construction totaled 1.43 million units at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate, up from 1.42 million in June. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family construction rose 6.3% last month while apartment starts fell 
1.2%. Analysts said the multifamily drop was a natural falloff from an 
unusually steep 32.9% increase in June. 
</P>
<P>
The operating rate at the nation's factories remained at 83.6% last month after 
declining 0.3 percentage point in June, the Fed reported. The rate hit a 
10-year high of 84.3% in December. Last month's operating rate was down from 
83.7% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater 
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and 
price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85% or above 
as an indication of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The operating rate at manufacturing plants slipped 0.1 percentage point to 
83.9%, down from June's 84%. That rate had peaked at 84.7% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The rate at factories producing durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to 
last more than three years -- edged down 0.3 percentage point from 82.6% in 
June. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods rose to 86.2%, compared 
to 86.1% in June.

CHEVROLET TO CUT PRICES ON ITS TOP SELLERS

General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division said Wednesday that it is cutting the 
base price of 1990 versions of its top-selling cars in a bid to regain market 
share lost to its chief competitor, Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
But overall prices for GM's 1990 cars are tentatively set to rise 3.4%, while 
those at Ford are set to rise 4.8%, and Chrysler Corp. has set a 5% rise. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, auto makers have generally raised prices less than 3% at the 
start of the model year. However, the larger price increases this year are 
intended to help recover the cost of installing federally required passive 
restraint systems such as automatic seat belts and air bags. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet said it lowered pre-introductory base prices on its Corsica and 
Beretta compact models by 5% and 2.4%, respectively. Those prices do not 
include standard options such as air conditioning or power window and door 
locks, and analysts said that with options packages the 1990 cars could end up 
costing more than their 1989 predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Car Division 
</P>
<P>
"We are at the point now when we are ready to face the competition," said 
Chevrolet division spokeswoman Ruth Bouldes. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford division, which excludes Lincoln-Mercury cars, has outsold Chevrolet 
in cars and trucks for the past three years, a situation that has become a sore 
point at GM. As GM's largest car division, Chevrolet accounts for nearly half 
of the car maker's auto sales. It has 5,000 dealers nationwide, one-fifth of 
the nation's dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 pre-introductory base price for a four-door hatchback Corsica sedan is 
$9,495, down from the 1989 figure of $9,985, the company said. The 1990 base 
Beretta two-door coupe will carry a price of $10,320, off from the 1989 base 
price of about $10,575. 
</P>
<P>
Corsica and Beretta have been among the five top-selling models in the United 
States in each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The comparative 1989 base price figures do not include a $425 destination 
charge. GM did not include a destination charge for its 1990 cars. 
</P>
<P>
The prices announced by GM are for use by dealers in taking fleet orders from 
business and government customers and for pre-selling 1990 models that will not 
arrive in showrooms for a few more weeks. Firm manufacturers' suggested retail 
prices will be announced by the companies closer to the start of the new model 
year on Oct. 1.

Roofing Firms Plan Merger: ACS Holding Co. of Carson and Universal Roofers of 
Phoenix said they plan to merge their roofing operations, creating the largest 
roofing contractor in North America. ACS Holding's Bryant Organization already 
is the nation's largest with an estimated $70 million in revenue this year, a 
spokesman said. Universal was ranked third last year based on 1987 revenue of 
$46 million by ENR, a weekly construction industry magazine. Merger 
negotiations are continuing, and the two companies said they hope to close the 
deal in October.

JUDGE DISMISSES CLAIM B OF A PLOTTED TO OVERTURN VERDICT

A federal judge has dismissed a woman's claim that Bank of America and two 
state appeal court justices plotted to overturn a $26-million jury award 
against the bank that she and her partners in an apple-processing business 
received. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco on Monday rejected 
Irene O'Connell Kruse's $200-million civil rights claim, calling it "wholly 
without merit" and based on "irrelevant, scurrilous charges." The judge also 
said she is considering imposing sanctions on Kruse's attorney, Frederick 
Watson of Walnut Creek, Calif., for filing the suit. Watson declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
A Sonoma County jury awarded Kruse and her partners $47 million in 1985. They 
had accused the bank in a lawsuit of fraud for allegedly causing the collapse 
of her Sebastopol, Calif., apple business by failing to lend her money after 
promising to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The award was later reduced to $26 million. A three-judge appellate panel then 
unanimously overturned the verdict, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. A 
Sonoma County judge is considering whether to grant a new trial, a Bank of 
America spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
After the award was overturned, Kruse filed a lawsuit alleging that Bank of 
America had conspired with Justices William Newsom Jr. and John Racanelli of 
the State Court of Appeal in San Francisco to quash the jury award. The 
defendants denied all of the charges.

EX-STAFFER, MCDONNELL SETTLE; DETAILS SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former employee of McDonnell Douglas' helicopter manufacturing unit Wednesday 
settled a civil fraud suit that had accused the company of overcharging the 
Army $175 million on the Apache helicopter program, but his lawyers refused to 
reveal the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William D. Keller approved the settlement and a 
confidentiality agreement providing that its details will be kept secret. 
Keller said the secrecy pact was "part of the bargain" that led up to the 
settlement and "I'm prepared to honor it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Justice Backed Out 
</P>
<P>
In late July, former employee Rod Stillwell told The Times that McDonnell 
Douglas had agreed to pay him nearly $500,000 to settle the case and that all 
major issues had been resolved. On Wednesday, Stillwell was not available for 
comment. His lawyers, William R. Ramsey and Louis J. Cohen, said they could not 
comment, as did Robert Scoular, McDonnell Douglas' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed under provisions of the False Claims Act that allow a 
private person to file a suit on behalf of the government. If there is recovery 
of damages in the case, the person gets up to 30% of the money. The rest goes 
to the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Stillwell's suit was filed in 1987. The Justice Department at one point joined 
the lawsuit, then bowed out, saying there was no evidence that the government 
had been damaged. In such circumstances, the statute allows the private 
plaintiff to proceed with the case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers for both sides issued a joint statement after a brief court hearing 
Wednesday afternoon. It said, in part: 
</P>
<P>
"After conducting an extensive investigation, the Department of Justice 
withdrew from the case, concluding that there was insufficient evidence that 
the alleged acts of the defendants resulted in any damage or injury to the 
United States. Consequently, no monies were paid by McDonnell Douglas 
Helicopter Co., Hughes Helicopters Inc. or Parker Hannifin Corp. (the other 
defendants) for, or in respect of, damages or any other amounts claimed or 
which might have been claimed on behalf of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Other knowledgeable sources said the language in the statement does not mean 
that Stillwell might not have received a monetary settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Cohen would add only that "the litigation has been settled 
and dismissed to the satisfaction of all parties." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consented to Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Since the suit was filed under the False Claims Act, the Justice Department had 
to approve the settlement. Judge Keller initially indicated that papers filed 
by McDonnell Douglas concerning the government's approval of the settlement 
were not specific enough. So, he had Scoular, McDonnell Douglas' lawyer, place 
a call to Justice Department lawyer Stephen Altman in Washington and the judge 
spoke to him over a speaker phone. 
</P>
<P>
Altman confirmed that the Justice Department had consented to the settlement. 
Keller asked him if the department's reason for agreeing was that "irrespective 
of any misfeasance, there had been no damage to the government." Altman 
answered yes. 
</P>
<P>
Scoular said the company's negotiations with the government had been conducted 
in confidence and asked that the settlement with the government be kept 
confidential, too. Altman said the government had not made a confidentiality 
agreement with McDonnell Douglas.

Amy Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Wednesday evening that 
McDonnell Douglas, the prime contractor on the helicopter, and Parker Hannifin, 
the subcontractor, each agreed to reimburse the Army $14,000 for investigative 
costs incurred in connection with the case. She said the two companies also 
agreed that they would not pass on to the government "in the form of future 
overhead" any costs they incurred during the case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Brown said, the two companies told the government that they each 
had incurred $115,000 in in-house costs in litigating the case. McDonnell 
Douglas told the Justice Department it had incurred $1.3 million in outside 
expenses, including legal fees in the case, she said, adding that Parker 
Hannifin said its outside costs had been $337,000. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, McDonnell Douglas attempted to have the suit thrown out of 
court on grounds that the law under which it was brought was unconstitutional. 
But Judge Keller rejected that argument in June, and a federal appeals court on 
July 31 declined the company's petition to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable legal sources said they believed that this was the first 
settlement of a False Claims Act suit that had not been made public.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: MATCHMAKER FOR MODEMS, PHONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Times.

<P>
Telephones are getting smarter all the time, but that can be a curse. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with a lot of fancy new telephone systems is that they don't 
connect very well with computer modems. A modem is an electronic gadget that 
gives a computer a monotone voice of sorts, allowing it to communicate with 
other computers over ordinary telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
It seems ironic that just about the time that modem manufacturers perfected the 
autodial modem, which lets a computer automatically place calls, the telephone 
system manufacturers invented products that those modems could not control. 
</P>
<P>
Until quite recently, telephones were basic electrical devices hooked into a 
sophisticated switching system maintained by the telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
Now most of the telephones installed at businesses and hotels, and even some 
pay telephones, are really special-purpose computer terminals disguised to look 
like telephones. Sure, you can talk into them, but when you punch their buttons 
to place or answer calls, you actually are entering keyboard commands into a 
computer system generically called a "digital switch." 
</P>
<P>
Such systems typically offer their owners many advantages over traditional 
phones, such as built-in message recording, multiple lines tied to a single 
number and control over telephone usage including time of day limitations and 
area code and exchange restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
A computer modem is easy to connect to a standard household telephone (where 
computerized phone systems haven't struck yet). One simply unplugs the 
telephone wire from the telephone wall jack and plugs it into a matching jack 
on the back of the modem. A second wire from the modem is plugged into the wall 
jack. 
</P>
<P>
When the computer modem is working, it takes over the line from the telephone. 
When the modem is not in use, voice signals from the telephone simply pass 
through it to the wall jack unhampered. 
</P>
<P>
The most common problem using a modem with the new computerized telephone 
systems is that it won't connect. The jack into which the telephone wire is 
plugged is the wrong size to accept the modem wire. And even if you could mate 
the modem wire and phone jack, the electrical signals are mismatched. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, a San Diego electronics engineer, Howard Gutzmer, has grappled 
with this problem for a couple of years and has perfected a virtually universal 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
It is a small plastic box festooned with switches, jacks and a short wire that 
allow any direct-connect style modem to be attached to a phone through the 
telephone handset jack instead of the wall jack. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Konexx," this $99 device lets you set the switches to match the kind of 
telephone, be it old-fashioned analog or the latest digital design. The Konexx 
is useful for hooking up with standard telephones that are hard-wired to the 
wall, as in many hotels and motels, but have a detachable handset. (There is 
also a special $124 version for fax machines that taps the electrical current 
available in a telephone line that the fax machine needs.) 
</P>
<P>
Once the connection is made and the switches are set properly (which may 
require a little trial and error), most modems can autodial through most 
telephones. In the worst cases, you'll have to dial manually with the 
telephone, but the modem will be able to establish a connection. 
</P>
<P>
The Konexx Model 106 is available from Gutzmer's firm, Unlimited Systems 
Automated, 9225 Chesapeake Drive, Suite 3, San Diego, Calif. 92123. Phone: 
(619) 277-3300. Gutzmer also makes private label versions for Traveling 
Software (it's called the Mo-Fone), Digital Systems (Black Jack II) and 
Computer Products Plus (CP+ Connection). All come with an alligator-clip wiring 
adapter that also allows them to be connected to the microphone in a handset if 
the mouthpiece is removable. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Products Plus packages its unit with telephone cable, adapter jacks, 
screwdriver and lighted magnifying glass in a handy zipper pack that it calls 
the "Road Warrior Toolkit" and sells for $140. The company is at 16321 Gothard 
St., Huntington Beach, Calif. 92647. Phone: (714) 847-1799. 
</P>
<P>
Gutzmer said he is working on another much needed gadget, a 2400-baud modem 
with acoustic couplers that can be used with pay phones and hard-wired hotel 
and motel phones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KONEXX: The Specs: A device used to connect modems to hard-wired or electronic 
telephones that are incompatible with computers. 
</P>
<P>
Features: Connects through the telephone handset or mouthpiece. Has switch 
settings for most analog and electronic telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements: Any direct-connect modem. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer: Unlimited Systems Automated, 9225 Chesapeake Drive, Suite 3, San 
Diego, Calif. 92123. Phone: (619) 277-3300. $99. Private-label versions made 
for Traveling Software, Digital Systems and Computer Products Plus. There is 
also a $124 fax version that passes needed electrical current from telephone 
line to a fax machine.

SEC ADOPTS RULE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BUYERS OF PENNY STOCKS MUST OK DEALS IN WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock brokers who deal in low-priced, often risky securities known as penny 
stocks must obtain a new customer's written approval before completing a sale, 
under a rule adopted Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the fraudulent sale of 
penny stocks, which are usually not traded on exchanges or quoted on the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System, commonly 
known as the national over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, the SEC voted to seek comment on two matters: 
</P>
<P>
* Revised rule proposals for disclosure of securities trades by corporate 
officers and other insiders. 
</P>
<P>
* A proposal to raise the minimum net capital required of registered broker 
dealers to as much as $250,000 depending on the method of computing net 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraudulent Claims 
</P>
<P>
The SEC was also supposed to consider new rules on information to be disclosed 
during takeover battles, but those proposals have been shelved until early 
September to give the agency more time to consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Because most penny stocks, usually selling for a few cents to a few dollars per 
share, are not listed nationally, information about them is hard to come by and 
fraudulent claims are difficult to dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Before the commission voted 5-0 to approve the rule, SEC Chairman David S. 
Ruder said the problem was of "great concern" to the agency. But he and several 
other members of the commission also noted that most penny stocks and penny 
stock dealers are legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Charles C. Cox said he was distressed that, because of bad 
publicity, "penny stock is almost becoming synonymous with fraud and 
manipulative practices." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in Chicago with an 
alleged $10-million penny stock scam in which the companies' share prices were 
artificially raised and the shares then sold at large profits. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Ruder created a Penny Stock Task Force that found a key element of 
penny stock fraud was high-pressure sales tactics -- often over the telephone 
-- on small, unsophisticated investors. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say the problem lies with unscrupulous salesmen who pressure 
investors to buy the high-risk stocks of new or small companies or with crooks 
peddling the stocks of sham companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The "rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse" is "the No. 1 threat" 
facing small investors, according to the North American Securities 
Administrators Assn., a state-level investment regulators group. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the current fiscal year, the SEC has received 2,462 
complaints about penny stock fraud compared to 1,510 for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This will help us in our investigations," James I. Goldstein, head of the task 
force, said of the new rule. "Here's something that will require writings to be 
made," said Goldstein, who is also an associate director of enforcement with 
the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule, first proposed in February, will require brokers and dealers to 
obtain written purchase agreements from new customers before completing their 
first three transactions in stocks that are not traded on stock exchanges or 
through the NASDAQ system. 
</P>
<P>
The rule would apply to stocks selling at $4.99 or less per share or to stocks 
issued by companies with less than $2 million in tangible assets. 
</P>
<P>
Broker-dealers would also have to obtain financial information from the 
customer such as income, investment experience and investment objectives; 
determine whether the transaction is suitable for the customer's needs, and 
write down the basis for that determination. 
</P>
<P>
Securities issued by some companies and sales to certain investors would be 
exempt from the "put it in writing" requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Those exceptions include initial public offerings that are scheduled to be 
listed with NASDAQ or a stock exchange and customers who have dealt with the 
broker previously.

CREDITORS, PHILIPPINES IN ACCORD ON DEBT 
</P>

<P>
The Philippine government and its major bank creditors said Wednesday that they 
have substantially agreed on a financing package that would provide the country 
with new loans and reduced debt. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached after only a week of negotiations, is the second since 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's debt-reduction plan was unveiled in 
March. An agreement with Mexico was announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
The bank committee represents creditors that are owed nearly half of the 
Philippines' total debt of $28 billion. Because the banks involved are not 
obliged to participate, it was not possible to determine the deal's exact 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers had said Tuesday that the overall package would likely be worth 
slightly less than the $1.7 billion that the Philippines requested when the 
talks began Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Buyback Plan 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the Philippine government and its bank advisory committee, 
headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said the talks have focused on the 
Philippines' intention to pursue its program in line with Brady's plan, which 
includes debt reduction and access to new financing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives in this exercise were candidly expressed to the banks at the 
outset of the talks," said Philippine Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez, who 
led the country's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers involved in the negotiations, which took only a week to conclude, said 
the financing package is devised of a debt buyback plan that allows banks to 
end their lending to the country or new loan options. The banks can choose 
which course to take. 
</P>
<P>
"The options of debt reduction and new lending are really directed at two 
different categories of banks -- those that wish to exit from the process as 
opposed to those that have determined to maintain their credit relationships in 
the country," said David Pflug, senior vice president at Manufacturers Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing 'Critical' 
</P>
<P>
He said the panel of negotiators is convinced that the country needs new 
financing and debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that we must reduce the country's existing stock of 
commercial bank debt if we are to sustain the country's economic growth over 
the longer term," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that "new commercial bank financing is critical for our program as the 
combined effect of our debt-reduction initiatives and our improving economy 
work to bring about the end of the debt problem for the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
Veterans of the three-month-long negotiations with Mexico that yielded an 
agreement July 23 said they were impressed by the speed and ease of the 
Philippine talks. The talks had been expected to last two full weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the committee of bankers negotiating on behalf of the 
country's international bank lenders had already agreed to a lower interest 
rate of 0.813% above the floating London Interbank Offer Rate on the new money, 
bankers said. The Philippines pays 0.875% above the London interbank rate, a 
main international benchmark.

INSURANCE LACK CAN TURN DISABILITY INTO DISASTER; 
</P>
<P>
NEW NEEDS FOR 'INCOME REPLACEMENT' POLICIES COME AT A TIME WHEN FEWER WORKERS 
HAVE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long-term disability insurance is something many workers can't foresee needing. 
But with the rise of AIDS and the advent of another modern-day affliction -- 
repetitive strain injuries -- some workers have found that they can't survive 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
The new need for the policies, which help replace lost income due to illness or 
injury, comes as competition among insurers is holding prices down. But because 
of modest payouts, most policies enable disabled workers to do little more than 
survive. Moreover, the workers who most need coverage -- those with the least 
economic cushion and some of the rougher jobs -- are often those who can't 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly referred to as "income replacement" plans, long-term disability 
policies have been around for years. 
</P>
<P>
But the policies now are covering circumstances unforeseen a few years ago, 
particularly the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the rapid 
rise of strain injuries caused by repetitive motions on the job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Important Asset' 
</P>
<P>
Long-term disability policies are designed to replace part of the salaries of 
workers afflicted with sicknesses or injuries for more than a month, and 
sometimes for years or even the rest of their lives. The usual policy provides 
either 50% or 60% of a worker's regular salary -- enough, insurers say, to help 
people get by without providing an incentive to stay out of work unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Some insurers argue that disability policies are as important as health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Your ability to earn income is your most important asset," said Joseph J. 
Milana III, an agent for Guardian Life Insurance Co. in Lake Success, N.Y. 
"Major medical (insurance) assures your physicians will be paid, but while 
you're out, who's paying you?" 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, one out of 
two 30-year-olds today will be disabled for three months or more before they 
reach age 65. But only 20% of the total U.S. work force is covered either by a 
private or corporate disability plan, according to an estimate by Daniel 
Thomas, assistant director of the Health Insurance Assn. of America, a trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Thomas said, the prime candidates for long-term disability insurance 
were white-collar professionals in low-risk occupations -- those who could 
easily afford the premiums but were unlikely to present claims, such as doctors 
and executives. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, insurers have become more aggressive in marketing disability policies 
to lower-level workers, according to Doug Carey, a partner in the New York 
office of Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting company. But workers who 
most need the coverage are usually those who can't afford it and don't have it 
unless their companies pick up the expense, Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decline in Coverage 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of blue-collar 
workers covered by long-term disability policies at large companies declined 
from 40% to 29% during the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Many large companies get long-term disability policies for employees at group 
rates, typically between 0.5% and 1% of an employee's salary. 
</P>
<P>
While some companies pay part or all of those premiums, others offer group 
policies under which employees pay the full cost. The advantage of employees' 
paying is that any benefits received are tax free -- not so, experts say, when 
the company picks up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
Group disability policies are generally less expensive than privately purchased 
ones, but employees can't keep them if they leave their company. Besides being 
"portable," private policies usually can be adapted to meet individual needs, 
experts say. Premiums vary according to a job's risk rating. 
</P>
<P>
Even people who have the insurance can encounter problems getting paid when 
they become disabled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Battle 
</P>
<P>
A Brooklyn, N.Y., pharmacist discovered the shortcomings of his disability 
coverage last year. He was earning more than $100,000 annually from two 
thriving drugstores he owned. But after years of twisting safety caps from 
pharmaceutical bottles -- between 200 and 300 a day, he estimates -- the 
pharmacist was struck with carpal tunnel syndrome, a debilitating injury to the 
nerves and tendons in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmacist, who is "totally left-handed," found it impossible to work, but 
thought he was adequately covered by two long-term disability policies. 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. One disability policy began paying out $2,400 a month, but the 
other insurance company -- asserting that he was seen carrying packages and was 
therefore not disabled -- challenged his claim, and the case is pending in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state Workers' Compensation Board required a hearing last 
month to prove that the injury was work related before paying any benefits. The 
hearing was postponed when the doctor for the insurance company holding the 
workers' comprehensive policy didn't show up. And the first insurance company 
recently requested another medical review of the pharmacist's condition. 
</P>
<P>
"With five kids, I've exhausted all my funds," said the 47-year-old pharmacist, 
who requested anonymity. "There's a lot about this coverage you don't know 
until it happens -- then you become an expert." 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in picking a policy and getting benefits is how insurers define 
"total disability," said John Nail, regional vice president for UNUM, a 
Portland, Maine-based company that handles about a third of the nation's 
$1.5-billion long-term-disability market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competitive Rates 
</P>
<P>
In the best policies, total disability isn't defined as inability to do any 
work, but as an illness or injury that prevents employees from carrying out the 
"material and substantial duties" of their occupations, Nail said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the surge in AIDS and repetitive-strain injury cases has not resulted 
in higher premiums, said John Walbridge, vice president of Hay Group, a New 
York-based human-resources consulting firm. "Rates for the group disability 
market have remained pretty competitive," Walbridge said. "It's one of the few 
stable benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the rate stability is competition caused by the entrance 
of many new insurers into the long-term disability market, UNUM's Nail said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, there were probably four or five serious players," Nail said. 
"Now there are 15 or 20 regular providers and 40 to 50 occasional ones."

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRIBUTE TO S.D. WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commonly held wisdom has it that Irving Gill is San Diego's sole legacy to the 
world of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Pick up almost any architectural book, and, if it mentions San Diego at all, 
the reference is usually to Gill. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, he has been this city's most significant innovator of the 20th 
Century, designing clean-lined, modern buildings beginning in 1907 or so, years 
before Le Corbusier, Mies Van Der Rohe, Loos and others became modern 
architecture's heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But there are important San Diego architects and designers largely ignored by 
history. Among them are the three women featured in the exhibit "In Harmony 
With the Land," opening Saturday at the Museum of San Diego History in Balboa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Women in Architecture and the San Diego Historical Society are teaming up to 
present the show, which will run through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Opening at the same time and running through Sept. 10 is "That Exceptional 
One," a tribute to 100 years of female architects, dating back to 1888 when 
Louise Blanchard Bethune became the first woman member of the American 
Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three San Diego architects featured in the local show, Lilian Rice is 
the best known. Also included are Hazel Waterman and landscape designer 
Harriett Wimmer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed in Total Site Planning 
</P>
<P>
The show's title is meant to reflect the way all three women believed in total 
site planning, with close relationships between buildings and their surrounding 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is best known for the Spanish-influenced buildings she designed in Rancho 
Santa Fe between 1922 and her death in 1938 at the age of 49 from an 
undiagnosed case of appendicitis. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was working for Richard Requa, the well-known designer of many of San 
Diego's finest Mediterranean-style homes, and his partner Herbert Jackson, when 
they were commissioned to come up with a master plan for Rancho Santa Fe and 
design several buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Because the commute from San Diego would have occupied too much of the 
partners' time, they turned day-to-day details over to Rice, and she eventually 
designed many of the buildings on Paseo Delicias in the business district of 
Rancho Santa Fe, as well as about 60 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Today, these buildings house Quimby's and Mille Fleurs restaurants, Ashley's 
market and other local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, some of the only buildings in the area were adobe ranch houses 
dating back to the mid-1800s. With these -- and probably the San Diego County 
missions -- in mind, the Santa Fe Land Improvement Co., the developers of 
Rancho Santa Fe, decided that Spanish-flavored architecture would be 
appropriate for the new community. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Rice's buildings in Rancho Santa Fe have tile roofs, deep-set window 
and door openings, interior courtyards and carefully laid-out gardens linked to 
the homes by French doors and generous windows. Most have white stucco walls 
that imitate the thick, plastered-over adobe found on buildings in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't a pioneer or innovator; she was carrying out the plan the 
developers wanted," said Lucinda Eddy, who completed her master's thesis on 
Rice at the University of San Diego in 1985 and helped organize the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to Rice's work. Outside Rancho Santa Fe, her residential 
designs have an entirely different appearance. Many use horizontal wood siding 
and shingle roofs, with interior walls paneled in redwood. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of this style is the rustic ZLAC Rowing Club at 1111 Pacific Beach 
Drive. A high ceiling supported by heavy redwood beams rises to a peak above a 
hardwood floor. French doors open out on a veranda at the edge of the beach on 
the shore of Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Rice learned to love natural materials while studying architecture at 
University of California, Berkeley, when the department was headed by John 
Galen Howard, who designed many campus buildings. Buildings such as the rowing 
clubhouse echo the organic, Craftsman style that Rice saw in the work of 
Howard, Bernard Maybeck and other San Francisco-rea architects. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rice's buildings are simple in form and materials, they do a masterful 
job of manipulating light and space. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted her structures to be an extension of the outdoors," Eddy said. "Her 
houses were intended to be details in the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subtle Innovations 
</P>
<P>
Although it is easy to pass off Rice as a talented but unoriginal designer 
heavily influenced by her mentors, her best work is innovative in subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine replacing the tile roofs on many of her Rancho Santa Fe homes with the 
flat roofs preferred by Gill, and her buildings show a strong relationship to 
modernism. Examine the way she masses and composes a home such as the Carpenter 
residence of 1928, and you see the eye of an artist at work. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rice's, the work of Waterman, who apprenticed with Gill and his partner, 
William Hebbard, is also under-appreciated. (Waterman later hired Rice as her 
own apprentice.) 
</P>
<P>
As Eddy pointed out, Waterman's success is remarkable considering she had only 
a year of college work in design and learned architecture from correspondence 
courses. Gill hired her after he designed a house for her and her husband and 
sensed she had talent. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her finest designs, including buildings in Balboa Park for the San 
Diego Children's Home, completed in 1925, are no longer standing. But 
photographs of them, and buildings such as her Wednesday Club (1911) at Ivy 
Lane and 6th Avenue, show that she assimilated Gill's flat surfaces, arched 
openings and carefully placed square and rectangular windows. 
</P>
<P>
While Rice and Waterman are well-represented by drawings and historic photos, 
Wimmer's work is tougher to document, according to Eddy. Wimmer laid out 
landscapes mostly in her head, so no drawings ever existed. Instead, her work 
will be represented by several photographs, and the lineup is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Working with landscape architect Joe Yamada, who became her partner in 1960, 
Wimmer handled plant selection and placement for Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, areas of the UC San Diego campus, Sea World and many homes. 
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday, in Room 102 at the Casa del Prado in Balboa Park, Sally Bullard 
Thornton, the author of a biography on Waterman, and Barbara Thornburgh Carlton 
will discuss Waterman's work.

HOME-GROWN SNAILS INCHING AHEAD ON MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
S-l-o-o-o-w-l-y but surely, Californians are beginning to raise, and eat, 
locally grown snails. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh snails are turning up on Westside menus, and small-time snail farmers are 
turning up in such unlikely places as North Hollywood and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Roland Gibert of Tulipe, who opened the Melrose Avenue restaurant in April 
with fellow chef Maurice Peguet, wouldn't dream of using snails from a can -- 
even one imported from France. 
</P>
<P>
When Gibert prepares his ravioli of dried cured duck with California snails in 
a lovely green sauce, or parsley coulis, ($8 per appetizer serving), he uses 
only the liveliest gastropods, delivered, on the foot as it were, from a dealer 
in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Kind of Respect 
</P>
<P>
Gibert buys 50 dozen live snails a week. With fresh snails, he explained, "I'm 
sure of what I'm getting." 
</P>
<P>
Chef Michael Roberts of Trumps on Melrose agrees that moving mollusks are 
superior to tinned ones. "From a chef's point of view, it's always better to 
start with something that's alive than with something that comes in a can," 
Roberts said. "You have a different kind of respect for food when you've 
started at the first step." 
</P>
<P>
Fresh snails have more "integrity" than canned ones, Roberts said, which is why 
he has served them as specials from time to time, either in red wine sauce with 
a whisper of garlic, or baked in a puffed pastry shell. 
</P>
<P>
"They are adorable," Roberts said of live snails. "They crawl around. You feed 
them. They become pets, and then you kill them." 
</P>
<P>
Most serious cooks and serious eaters prefer fresh snails, but preparing them 
for the table is no piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purged of Impurities 
</P>
<P>
They must be purged of impurities before they can be safely cooked and eaten, a 
process that traditionally involves feeding them cornmeal or giving them only 
water for days or even weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Feniger of City Restaurant on La Brea Avenue and the Border Grill on 
Melrose recalls that she and partner Mary Sue Milliken once shared their 
kitchen for several days with 10 buckets of California-grown snails. Eventually 
the women combined them with Serrano chilies, lime juice and cilantro to make 
snail salad for a restaurant-industry crowd. But as chef Gibert noted of the 
fresh snail: "From the live one to the plate, there's a lot of nasty work to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of back yard snail farmers are willing to deal with the 
mundane unpleasantness of "snailiculture" in hopes of eventually making money 
on the mollusks. Like an earlier generation of worm farmers, they hope, naively 
or not, to spin a profit from a small initial investment and a lot of hard work 
nurturing unusual livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Simmons, who has been eating back yard snails since 1975, is gearing up 
to farm them commercially. She has about 12,000 head of the common garden 
variety -- Helix aspera -- in a homemade snailery on her property in North 
Hollywood. Simmons said her voracious stock eats all kinds of greens (something 
home gardeners already knew). They also like commercial catfish food, although 
they turn up their tentacles at hen food. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons shields her snails from the sun so they won't dry out. She devises ways 
to keep them well watered without allowing them to tumble in the water and 
drown. She tidies up after them, doing the snail farmer's equivalent of mucking 
out the stable. And she keeps them out of her neighbor's dahlias by edging the 
snailery with copper. 
</P>
<P>
"When the copper hits their slime, it gives them a slight shock, and they 
usually won't crawl over it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Simmons, snails were the first C rations. The Roman army found the 
live gastropods a convenient food to carry into war. They are a superior, 
low-calorie source of protein, said Simmons, who also believes that snail slime 
has curative properties. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons can't imagine why more Americans don't harvest the bounty slowly 
traversing their own back yards, as Europeans have done for centuries. "How 
better to rid your garden of the little creatures than to eat them?" asked 
Simmons, who likes hers dusted with a little seasoned flour and fried. 
</P>
<P>
Like hundreds of others, Simmons has been encouraged in her dream of better 
living through snail farming by Ralph Tucker, 72, a retired insurance salesman 
who lives in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker is the nation's leading booster of the home-grown or boutique snail, 
founder and president of the Snail Club of America, which has 750 members in 
the United States and 300 in other countries. According to Tucker, half the 
members of the club have commercial aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who calls himself the snail king, is not amused by the sniggers with 
which listeners sometimes greet his strong pro-snail views. "They are 
laughing," he said, "at the greatest food God put on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
According to Tucker, the diner who downs a canned snail "might as well be 
eating paper." Tucker has given seminars in which he advises prospective 
farmers to start out with a half whiskey barrel, filled with moist dirt, snails 
and some lettuce to munch on, topped with a piece of "screen-door screen." For 
safety's sake, he warns converts never to eat a wild snail whose diet they 
haven't personally supervised for at least 30 days. "If a snail is alive at the 
end of a month, you know that's a healthy snail," he counsels. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's next project will be a videotape for cooks on what to do with them 
besides drowning them in garlic butter. His own uses for the gastropod, which 
he supplies to several restaurants in the Fresno area, include snail calzone 
(which he calls the Tucker Turnover) and snail jerky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$300 Million in Imports 
</P>
<P>
Tucker believes that there is a largely untapped market among "the upper crust" 
(the name of his newsletter) for domestic snails. Tucker said the United States 
imports $300 million worth of inferior snails from France, Taiwan and elsewhere 
each year. He believes that Americans could take over the snail market and that 
their product -- good domestic snails for the gourmet palate -- might command 
as much as $100 a pound. (Canned snails imported from France are selling for 
$10 a pound in some local supermarkets.) Tucker also believes that they could 
be dried and turned into a protein-rich, powdered food for the world's poor and 
hungry (possible slogan: "Let them eat escargots!"). 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said he has about 4,000 snails in a wooden back yard "oasis." As they 
fatten for market, he serenades them with classical and easy-listening music. 
"Right now their favorite song is 'Wind Beneath My Wings,' " he said. "They 
also like Stevie Wonder's 'I Just Called to Say I Love You.' But they don't 
like Stevie. They like the instrumental version." 
</P>
<P>
In San Pedro, Giuseppe Cracchiolo has also hitched his wagon to a snail. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old native of Italy, Cracchiolo makes his living as a fisherman. As a 
sideline, he raises white snails -- Otala lactea -- which he said are far more 
tender than the common variety. Once people discover that succulent fresh 
snails are readily available, they'll never go back to the rubbery canned kind, 
he said. "You wouldn't want to eat a fish that was three or four days old," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sicilian Style 
</P>
<P>
Although Cracchiolo sometimes keeps snails nearing market size (about 1 1/4 
inches) in plastic containers in his garage, the bulk of his herd is penned in 
a snailery on rural property owned by his uncle. There the feed bag is often 
filled with bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
In Sicily, Cracchiolo's mother stewed snails, still in their shells, with 
potatoes and tomatoes. He still likes them best that way. 
</P>
<P>
Although the young entrepreneur sells his product to a retailer in the Fresno 
area for 35 cents each, Cracchiolo hasn't been able to sell his wife, Geralynn, 
on snails. 
</P>
<P>
"She's American," he explained. "She thinks they're gross."

SPELLING OUT THE AMERICAN WAY; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRANTS LEARN MORE THAN ENGLISH AT SCHOOL DISTRICT'S 'NEWCOMER CENTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Yellow square, yo-yo, semitrailer truck and window cleaner may not be typical 
words for a high-school spelling bee, but this was neither a typical bee nor 
were these typical high-school students. 
</P>
<P>
The nine sweaty-palmed teen-agers took turns stepping to the mike and then, 
haltingly, uttered letters upon command. 
</P>
<P>
Shoes was the command. "Esch, aytch, ohh, eee, ezz," was the reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Rhinoceros," another student was told. "Aarrr, hetch. . . ." he began. 
</P>
<P>
It was the final spelling bee at the Newcomer Center, and the contestants, all 
recent immigrants to the United States, spelled with a variety of accents the 
practical words they had learned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accent on Success 
</P>
<P>
The center for ninth- through 11th-graders, housed at Crenshaw High School, and 
a companion program in Bel-Air for younger children were opened by the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. They aim not only to supply students with 
no-nonsense vocabularies but also to orient them to this country and provide 
psychological support and career advice. After a year at the centers, the 
students will move on to regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We want boys and girls to feel good about themselves, because if they do, 
they'll feel more successful," said Juliette Thompson, principal of Bellagio 
Road Newcomer School for Grades 4 through 8. "When they finish at our school, 
they will be able to go into any school . . . and operate successfully." 
</P>
<P>
Thrust into a regular school, children new to America are often ostracized, she 
said. "Even if they step out onto the playground, (if) they don't know the 
rules, how to play the games . . . they're quickly isolated. They stand under 
the tree, by the side, in back and don't feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Students are eligible to attend the centers if their English is limited and 
they are new to the United States or to its schools. Most of the students are 
from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. But others are from such 
places as South Korea, the Philippines, China, Armenia and Bolivia. Some have 
been in this country for only a few days; others had lived in Los Angeles for 
more than a year without enrolling in school, said Michael Bujazan, coordinator 
of the district's Student Guidance, Assessment and Placement Center, which 
places the students in the newcomer centers. Students with limited English 
skills from northeast Los Angeles, parts of Hollywood, and other sections of 
the city are sent to the guidance center for testing and placement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'High-Powered Orientation' 
</P>
<P>
The district has tried to help immigrant students with six-week crash courses 
in American culture and English, as well as English-as-a-Second-Language and 
bilingual classes at many schools, but these programs cannot keep up with the 
need, administrators said. An estimated 62,000 students, or more than 10% of 
the district's total, are immigrants who have attended U.S. schools less than 
three years. The crash courses barely make a dent: for the 1989-90 school year 
they will only serve a fifth of these students. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomer centers have a maximum enrollment of 450 students. But the centers 
are more comprehensive than other district programs for immigrants, said Maria 
Olmos, administrator of the center at Crenshaw High. With a slew of bilingual 
teachers, aides, psychologists and counselors, the purpose is "strictly 
high-powered orientation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
More immigrants are arriving in the district every day. The guidance center 
tests more than 30 new students daily. They are given options of attending 
their neighborhood schools if the schools are not overcrowded, being bused 
elsewhere, and if they qualify, joining the newcomer centers. About 85% of them 
are eligible for the centers and 99% would be if the centers were open to all 
grades rather than only grades 4 through 11, Bujazan said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the 450-student cap, the program at Crenshaw High is being limited 
mainly to residents of central Los Angeles, the area in the district receiving 
the most immigrants, said Gloria Sierra of the district's Office of Bilingual 
and ESL Instruction. Crenshaw High was selected as a site largely because it 
had the available space, administrators said. The Bellagio school, which is 
taking children mostly from northeast Los Angeles and parts of Hollywood and 
central Los Angeles, had been unused since 1984. Most of the students are bused 
to the centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Enrollment 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of articles in Korean- and Chinese-language newspapers, 
enrollment at the Crenshaw center shot up from 101, when it opened its 
half-day, summer session on July 3, to about 225 students from 12 countries by 
the time it closed last Friday. The center, on the second floor of the high 
school, re-opens for a full-day schedule Sept. 12. The Bellagio school opened 
Friday with 225 students from eight nations, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed two years ago by former school board member Alan Gershman, the centers 
each have annual budgets of more than $526,000 for counselors, interpreter 
aides, a psychologist, a nurse, and other support personnel, Sierra said. In 
developing the centers, district officials visited school programs for 
newcomers in San Francisco and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the teachers are immigrants. At the Crenshaw center, Bob Mei, who came 
from China last year, said he knows that his Chinese students are used to "just 
(sitting) straight, (listening) to the teacher solo," but here, they learn they 
have to speak up in class. Guillermo Pasillas has photos of Mexican actors 
Cantinflas and Lucia Mendez on the bulletin board. Pasillas said he empathizes 
with his 31 Latino students because when he arrived in this country from Mexico 
at age 9, "I had to learn, sink or swim." 
</P>
<P>
While the spelling bee continued, other classes at the Crenshaw center played 
soccer or read stories in Spanish. LaVerne Fisher's class played a version of 
bingo with names of fruits and vegetables, in preparation for a field trip to a 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
In the room decorated with charts of U.S. coins, the Pledge of Allegiance and 
students' drawings of flags and maps of their native countries, teacher's 
assistant Eva Ramos held up placards of beets and pumpkins. Students wrote down 
the names in squares on their papers. Later, those who know more English read 
from "Unusual Stories From Many Lands," while the rest copied the names of more 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
Several students in Pasillas' class, instructed to paint something, have 
depicted their war-torn homelands with stick-figure civilians under a hail of 
bombs or bullets. Jose Lopez, 16, drew a brown eye crying and a man shooting at 
a bull's-eye. In Salvadoran cities, he said, the military comes to campuses 
after school to "recruit" boys -- and if the military doesn't pick them up, 
"then the other side, the guerrillas, get them," he said through an 
interpreter. He pointed to his painting of an arrow-pierced heart dripping with 
blood, explaining that that is "what they leave behind." 
</P>
<P>
One 15-year-old boy and his mother, in fleeing Guatemala three weeks ago, had 
guns put to their heads at the Guatemalan border, said center psychologist 
Bradley Pilon. Then their money was taken by Mexicans who threatened to turn 
them in to authorities. After crossing into the United States with the help of 
coyotes, people who sneak immigrants across the border for a fee, they were 
locked in a house several days until the coyotes were paid. The mother now 
sells bags of oranges at a freeway entrance, Pilon said. 
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, adjusting to life here can be difficult, Pilon said. A 
fight erupted one day and he wondered if it was because the students are "more 
on edge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Haven From the Streets 
</P>
<P>
Octavio Rivera, who came by himself from Mexico City two years ago, says he's 
bored at school. He would rather work than go to class, but finding a job has 
become harder, he said through an interpeter at La Posada, an East Los Angeles 
boys home run by Our Lady Queen of Angels Church. 
</P>
<P>
Before living at the home, Rivera, 17, lived on the streets. He was stabbed in 
the hand by a robber and worked as a day laborer. School is just a way to kill 
time, he said, adding that as soon as he can earn some money, he wants to 
return to Mexico "and never again put my feet in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
But many students don't mind reviewing spelling lists and flash cards of 
animals, acting out skits about friendship and singing "She'll Be Coming Round 
the Mountain." They see this as part of their ticket to success. Spelling bee 
finalist Jesus Flores, who studied spelling lists but tripped up on nails, said 
in English: "I want to be somebody someday -- a medical doctor." He added that 
he's thrilled that he's starting to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the students say that coming to this country was worthwhile 
because of the educational opportunities, Pilon said. In case they start to 
doubt that, the center is ready to tout the benefits of schooling. "A high 
school education doesn't mean anything in this country in terms of pay," Pilon 
said. If a youngster just wants a job, he or she "might as well drop out now. 
But it does mean something in terms of future opportunities (to attend 
college)," he said. Scholarships are to be given to four students from the 
center who enter college, Olmos said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students are eager learners, their teachers say. Luis Rafael Bat 
scribbles down, phonetically, English phrases that he hears outside of class, 
and then brings them to teacher Pasillas for translation. His steno pad is 
filled: "Juen Quen Ay Si Yu Agen" (when can I see you again); "five tauson," 
(five thousand); "Evry Dey Yu Luk Peri-err," (every day you look prettier). 
</P>
<P>
They are also quickly forming opinions about living in this country. Bat, 15, 
who was wearing a "Venice Beach"-inscribed tank-top and black Nike shorts, 
feels a special affinity to the Batman craze because of his surname. He signs 
his papers with a bat drawing. "He likes to capitalize on American culture," 
Pasillas said. Fisher's students are allowed to play music tapes of their 
choice as a reward -- and their favorite is rap music. Jesus Flores, who came 
from Mexico in 1987, appreciates that "in the United States, the police do not 
just have the right to break into your house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learning About Bias 
</P>
<P>
But Jose Tista, a 16-year-old Guatemalan who lives at La Posada, said that 
outside of class, he feels discriminated against by Latinos who speak fluent 
English and are longtime U.S. residents. "The law says that nobody should be 
discriminated against because of color or what kind of person you are," he said 
through an interpreter. But he is put down by Mexican-Americans who know that 
he doesn't know much English. 
</P>
<P>
In class, Tista said, it's different because everyone is a new immigrant. 
Fisher said she is struck by the students' cooperation. "They help each other," 
she said, adding that students in her honors English classes at other schools 
"don't share their answers or their expertise. They're grade-hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's class and three others have all Spanish-speaking students, but in some 
classes, the students are drawn from opposite ends of the globe.

In Mei's class of youths from China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, Honduras, 
Mexico and El Salvador, everybody chips in to buy cakes on classmates' 
birthdays. Karen Ng, who emerged as one of center's five spelling bee champs, 
said she uses Cantonese, Spanish and English to communicate with her fellow 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned Spanish from my classmates: 'Good morning,' 'How are you,' 
'friend' . . . and 'Shut up,' " she said, adding that she wants to major in 
Spanish and economics in college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for September 
</P>
<P>
In September, the potpourri expands with the return of the regular Crenshaw 
students, but administrators don't foresee any problems. The newcomer students 
will be taking their own set curriculum of orientation, introduction to U.S. 
heritage, math and language arts -- taught in English with the help of 
bilingual aides, in Spanish and in Mandarin -- as well as ESL and art, Olmos 
said. But they will join the Crenshaw student body for lunch and physical 
education, she said. Olmos also wants to start tutoring, a buddy system and a 
folkloric dance group from among the two student populations. 
</P>
<P>
The center's students have been encouraged to jump into the mainstream. Junior 
Tanya Acosta, a star on Crenshaw's track team, assured Fisher's students in 
Spanish that they had nothing to worry about, explaining that she came from 
Guadalajara a year ago. The blacks and other members on the track team accepted 
her even though she was the only Latina. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, we didn't talk a lot -- they said, 'Hi, how are you?' and I 
didn't understand what they were saying, so I didn't answer," Acosta recalled. 
Fisher's class giggled nervously. 
</P>
<P>
But soon, she said, she had no problems making friends. "On the team, I learned 
a lot of English." 
</P>
<P>
The newcomer students, Fisher said, "never think they have the right to join a 
club, do sports, or to be a cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't think they're ready to do it, because they don't know enough 
English. But you don't have to know English" to start, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mei, who calls students at home to see if they have questions about their 
lessons: "In one year, they'll really be different."

CULVER CITY TIES PROJECT OK TO RECREATION FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a match to decide the fate of a vacant lot that once featured a sports club 
with tennis courts, the Culver City Council has volleyed the ball back to the 
developer, allowing him to build townhouses there only if he gives the city 
$280,000 for recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Monday has sparked arguments over the council's timing and over 
the city's need for facilities to replace those that the club had. It has also 
brought to the fore the debate over private property owners' rights versus 
public need. 
</P>
<P>
The council seems "to be overlooking completely that they're not publicly run 
facilities. . . . It's our land, it's private land," said Mitch Chupack, a 
representative for property owner Richard K. Ehrlich. Chupack said the 
developer will proceed with a suit alleging that the city has taken his 
property without just compensation and has violated his due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
"These were private tennis courts. (The council members) want (them) replaced 
gratuitously," said Fred Gaines, attorney for the developer. "The law does not 
allow them to randomly extort money from a developer," he said, calling the 
$280,000 "way out of line." 
</P>
<P>
Several council members deny that the request is extortion, saying that the 
30-townhouse project at 4901 Overland Ave. entails a substantial loss of 
recreational facilities. The owner, they say, will cash in on the several 
zoning and plan changes that are required by the development. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich proposed the townhouses when he closed the Westside Sports Club in 
September, after nearly 15 years of barely breaking even. The City Council in 
April rejected the plan, 4 to 1, because of concerns over the loss of the 
facilities. The council also determined that the city could not afford to buy 
the club to use as a recreation center. A city-ordered study concluded that the 
club would not be able to compete in today's market without major renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alexander, the only vote for the project, was concerned that 
the city could be liable for limiting a property owner to a land use that has 
proved unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council decided to reconsider its April decision, and Ehrlich 
sued the city to protect his rights pending the outcome of the reconsideration. 
Meanwhile, Ehrlich and Councilman Steven Gourley discussed possible 
settlements, such as the developer's building four tennis courts on city land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designated for Sports Use 
</P>
<P>
The site is designated for use as a sports facility, which Ehrlich had 
requested in the mid-1970s "because tennis was very popular," Chupack said. "It 
seemed like a good use for the site." The club included five tennis courts, two 
paddle tennis courts, and a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Monday night decision came after an hourlong executive session 
and conversations in which City Atty. Joseph Pannone shuttled between the 
council members in closed quarters and Gaines in the council chamber audience. 
Neighbors of the site and a former city planning commissioner called any 
developer contributions extortion, but the council attached the $280,000 
condition to its approval of the project. Councilman James Boulgarides voted 
against approval, saying that the development was too large. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone's going to tear down a vacant lot where kids used to play baseball 
. . . you've got to ask what (the developer) is going to do to mitigate the 
effect on the community," Gourley said, while praising the project for its 
"very livable units" and open space. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Blum, who sat on the Planning Commission when it approved the project, 
said at the meeting that "Culver City is on the take." Residents said afterward 
that they had been bothered by noise, lights and partying from the sports club 
and criticized the council for "trading votes for money," as neighbor Paulette 
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Other sports club entrepreneurs will be scared off, Alexander said, for fear 
that they will be slapped with fines if they fail and then try to close. He 
nevertheless voted for the approval. He said later: "I wanted to give him at 
least the approval of the project. . . . Perhaps the developer can come back to 
us with a counterproposal." 
</P>
<P>
But Gourley later said that to label the council's action extortion was ironic, 
because the approval of the project will boost the site's value by more than 
$280,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Called Backhanded 
</P>
<P>
The developer and others also faulted the council for what they said was a 
backhanded, 11th-hour decision. 
</P>
<P>
Cities such as Santa Monica require developers to offset negative impacts of 
their projects, such as increased traffic and loss of open space, but such 
requirements are spelled out "when you walk in the door," Chupack said. Said 
Alexander: "You don't wait until literally the last minute, and have additional 
fees thrown in (the developer's) face. In a government of laws, people know 
what's going to happen before it happens, not on the whim of an individual city 
council. That figure could have easily been $2 million or $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Any stipulations, Alexander said, should have been raised while the proposal 
was before the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But Pannone said that as long as the conditions are reasonable ($6 million, he 
offered, would not be in this case) and reasonably related to the detrimental 
impact, the city has a constitutional right to impose them in the public 
interest. Pannone said the condition in this case was similar to the city's 
laws that developers install public art or pay into a public arts fund and that 
commercial developers pay for mitigation of increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The 1965 state Quimby Act requires developers to pay fees or contribute land 
for neighborhood parks. 
</P>
<P>
In the sports club case, Pannone said, "it's just a different kind of impact 
that is being demanded to be mitigated." 
</P>
<P>
The city does not, and cannot, have specific laws to address all types of 
mitigation, he said, saying that to his knowledge, this was the city's first 
case involving replacement of sports facilities. "You don't know what the 
current use (of a piece of property will be)," he said. 'You need some 
flexibility to cover that one-in-50 set of facts." 
</P>
<P>
But whether the city even needs such facilities is also a contested point, with 
the developer saying the sports club failed because of under-use and 
competition. Alexander said the city does not "need any more tennis courts. . . 
. I still can get a court Sunday morning with no more than a 10-minute wait." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said that when the Westside Sports Club closed, 182 members -- less 
than a third of the total -- were Culver City residents. 
</P>
<P>
Gourley, however, said that the city had to consider future needs and that the 
townhouse tenants themselves would be demanding such facilities. And whether 
the tennis players "standing in front of you (in line) are from Los Angeles or 
Culver City . . . is (not) important," he said. "People of surrounding 
communities have a tendency to use those facilities, and we can't stop them. . 
. . We have to provide as many facilities as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Also disputed is the cost of the tennis courts. The $280,000, Gourley said, is 
the approximate cost of building four courts at $70,000 each, a figure arrived 
at by the recreation division in consultation with Los Angeles city and county 
officials. Council members indicated that the money was preferable to the 
developer's building four courts because the council could then choose to build 
courts, a swimming pool or whatever is most needed. Chupack disagreed, 
estimating that building four unlit courts would cost $80,000 at most. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball now in his client's court, Gaines said that the settlement offer 
of four tennis courts is still good but that he will serve the lawsuit on the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Chupack said the council made a serious mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked a gift horse in the mouth and said, 'Screw you, we want more.' "

SANTA MONICA MAY HIRE CONSULTANT TO LOBBY FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica, which already spends a third of its social service budget on the 
homeless, declines to prosecute them for nonviolent crimes and has entertained 
a proposal by one city councilman to let them camp on the City Hall lawn, will 
soon make another bid to take a leading role in rallying California cities to 
fight homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Mayor Dennis Zane, the city has authorized spending $30,000 to 
retain a consultant to organize local governments' support for action at the 
state and federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$30,000 Set Aside 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know that all of this is achievable because we don't know if other 
communities, other mayors for example, will be interested in participating," 
said Zane, "but we can find out." 
</P>
<P>
Zane proposed the action Aug. 1 after Gov. George Deukmejian in July vetoed 
$116 million in funding for state mental health clinics. Local health officials 
said the veto could force eight clinics in Los Angeles County to close. Health 
experts, noting that at least 30% of the homeless have a diagnosable mental 
disorder, say a shutdown of the clinics would hit the homeless especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
With little debate, the city council set aside $30,000 to hire a lobbyist to 
work at the state and national levels to increase funding for homeless-related 
programs. But Zane's request was vaguely worded and left details to be worked 
out by City Manager John Jalili. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion between the two makes it clear that the mayor envisioned a 
homelessness consultant with a much broader role, akin to that of a political 
activist. Zane, who helped lead the movement for renters' rights in Santa 
Monica, said he proposes "an organizer skilled in bringing people together to 
put presure on higher government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggestion 'Anecdotal' 
</P>
<P>
"It's politics, not electoral politics, but still politics," the mayor said. 
"Cities need to organize politically" to ensure action. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members backed the mayor's plan in general but disagreed over 
some details. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm strongly in favor of it, but what I'm not able to say is where you draw 
the line between political lobbying and building expertise," said Councilman 
David Finkel. Finkel, an ally of the mayor, said he hoped the city could keep 
the issue of homelessness apolitical while gathering enough experience to 
redirect state priorities toward the issue. 
</P>
<P>
For example, although Zane has suggested that an organizer might coordinate 
state mayoral delegations to the governor's office or to Washington to pressure 
lawmakers, Finkel called such suggestions "anecdotal" and said the consultant's 
principal focus should be on day-to-day functions such as negotiating with Los 
Angeles County on coordinating services. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Herb Katz, who differs with Zane on many issues, voted for the 
measure but said lobbying should be a small part of the effort and should be 
conducted just at the state level for local concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather spend the money more at a local level to feed the homeless than 
just throw it at a consultant," said Katz. "I'm not sure it's going to make a 
dent in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Social-service providers from other nearby communities applauded the Santa 
Monica commitment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Excellent Idea' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an excellent idea," said Jodi Curlee, West Hollywood social 
services administrator. "It can only further the goals for regional 
coordination." 
</P>
<P>
But an official with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, who 
asked not to be named, was skeptical that the consultant could be very 
effective with lobbying as the main duty. "It just seems much to me (to expect 
that) a full-time person doing nothing but lobbying for the homeless" will 
succeed, given the scope of the problem and the extent of work already being 
done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 survey by the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG) counted 
45,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County. Zane has said repeatedly that 
homelessness ranked with drug-related crime among concerns at a National 
Conference of Mayors meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the California League of Cities, SCAG and Los Angeles County all 
said the Santa Monica proposal was, as far as they could determine, unique in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a critical need today to provide a better solution to the homeless 
problem than we've been doing," said Joe Carreras, senior planner for SCAG, 
"and if you don't have any leadership, you don't get the darn thing started."

PILOT TO RE-CREATE OPEN-COCKPIT FLIGHT OF 1929 WOMEN'S AIR DERBY CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1929, an air derby featuring 20 women pilots hopscotching across the country 
in their open-cockpit planes was a big enough deal to draw thousands of 
cheering people to airstrips from Santa Monica to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was whether women could be aviators. The answer was yes, as amply 
demonstrated by such pioneering pilots as Amelia Earhart and First Women's Air 
Derby victor Louise Thaden. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a 1980s pilot, who happens to be a woman, will pay homage to Thaden 
and her cadre of trailblazers when she takes off from Santa Monica Airport to 
re-create the race on its 60th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Dusenbury, 40, a commercial pilot for Airborne Express, will be behind 
the controls of the restored Travel Air D4000 in which Thaden won her historic 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
She will be dressed in authentic 1920s aviator equipment, complete with goggles 
and hat that are essential in an open-air cockpit. There is no radar, radio or 
other communication device in the plane, Dusenbury said in a telephone 
interview from her home in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Stops 
</P>
<P>
Dusenbury will find her way with a magnetic compass and by "winging it," that 
is, navigating by visual landmarks. The plane holds enough fuel for 3 1/2 
hours, so frequent stops are built into the trip. In Texas alone, she will 
touch ground at five different airports. 
</P>
<P>
A licensed airplane mechanic who has restored antique planes, Dusenbury said 
she flies her own plane to lunch every Saturday, meeting 20 to 70 fellow flying 
enthusiasts in Madison, N.C.. 
</P>
<P>
She has already delivered the Travel Air to California, where it is undergoing 
last-minute fine-tuning for takeoff tomorrow. Dusenbury said she is excited 
about honoring Thaden, a "great person and aviatrix" whose motto was "Take care 
of your engine and your engine will take care of you." 
</P>
<P>
"This derby symbolizes the dramatic achievement that women have made in 
aviation," Dusenbury said. "Louise Thaden was more than just a winner of this 
race. She represents the spirit of all women aviators, of their abilities and 
their courage." 
</P>
<P>
In the first derby, one of the pilots died en route and another landed in a 
field, put out a cockpit fire and took off again. According to Dusenbury, they 
ranged from socialites to country-bred, but shared the trait of independence. 
"I think you sort of had to have a mind of your own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dusenbury said media interest in the 1929 race was fueled by its timing -- it 
had not been that long since women gained the right to vote. The race, later 
dubbed the "Powder Puff Derby," overshadowed a men's race that was taking place 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Thaden was involved in another first seven years later when she became the 
first woman to enter a race with men. Race sponsors offered one cash prize for 
the first-place winner and another for the woman who came in first. Thaden won 
the race and all of the money in an old worn-out plane. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew how to get speed," Dusenbury said.

RENT BOARD ATTORNEY QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel Martin Levy, who once headed the Santa Monica Rent Control Board's legal 
department before stepping down to a senior attorney position earlier this 
year, will resign effective Sept. 15. He plans to go into private practice. 
</P>
<P>
Levy, who has been with the board since 1980, becomes the third board attorney 
to quit in weeks. Sally Malloy, who succeeded Levy as chief of the department, 
resigned earlier this month. Staff attorney Barbara Greenstein quit about the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing speculation that board attorneys are becoming increasingly 
frustrated by the board's frequent decisions to ignore the legal department's 
recommendations. Levy, however, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Julie Lopez Dad also recently announced her resignation from the 
elected five-member board effective at the end of the year. That means that 
four seats will be up for election in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations come at a time when the board is trying to win public support 
for its voluntary inclusionary housing program, which would allow landlords to 
raise rents on some units by as much as $900 if the rent on an equal number of 
units is reduced to as low as $266 for poor people. 
</P>
<P>
Major groups representing tenants and landlords have come out against the 
program, although some landlords are expected to participate if it is 
implemented.

DEVELOPER FEES OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved a plan Monday night to collect an estimated $1.2 
million in fees from developers for transportation and safety improvements, 
freeing up general fund money for additional police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
The fees can only be used for traffic-signal and control devices, roads and 
highways, public safety projects and parks, and cannot be used for salaries. 
Using the fees for those projects will allow the city to allocate more money 
from the general fund to hire and train 19 police officers, create a new fire 
engine company for north Pomona and fund a hazardous-materials response team. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1, with Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer opposed, to 
establish the following fees, effective immediately: 
</P>
<P>
* 25 cents per square foot of new construction for public safety improvements. 
</P>
<P>
* $675 per residential unit for park and recreation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
* $5 per trip for projected increase in vehicle traffic to pay for 
traffic-signal and control devices. 
</P>
<P>
* $5 per trip for road and highway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The fees, along with taxes on developers, are part of a $2.7-million 
revenue-generating package approved tentatively approved last month by the 
council when it passed the $68.3-million budget for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The developer taxes -- 1% on new single-family homes, commercial buildings and 
industrial facilities and 2% on new apartments and condominiums -- are expected 
to raise $825,000 for the city's general fund, which the council may spend as 
it chooses.

PERMIT YANKED, CLUB FOLDS

<TEXT>
<P>
b.c., regarded as the trendiest nightspot in Los Angeles after it opened in 
February, has closed its doors for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to do something else," co-owner Eric Goode said after last week's 
unanimous decision by the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Administration to revoke 
the club's conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
The nightspot, which attracted a stream of celebrities as a disco, closed May 
30. Residents complained that unruly patrons had turned their quiet, 
residential neighborhood into a "combat zone." 
</P>
<P>
During its last weeks, the owners tried to operate b.c., 7561 Sunset Blvd., as 
an exclusive supper club, but were handicapped by lack of a liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
The owners had hoped to obtain a liquor license and reopen, but the loss of the 
conditional-use permit erased any chance of that happening, Goode said. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning board agreed with neighbors that the club's owners had violated the 
terms of the conditional-use permit by allowing dancing without a permit.

<P>
1,000 SIGN GROWTH PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venice Town Council members gathered 1,000 signatures Sunday in support of 
their proposal to halt commercial development in Venice for a year while an 
environmental impact report is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
John Haag, who heads the group's moratorium committee, said petitions were 
circulated at the sixth annual Venice Arts and Crafts Festival. The group goal 
is to collect 5,000 signatures to demonstrate community support for the ban to 
6th District Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has said she opposes the ban as illegal. She said a stiff interim 
control ordinance is already controlling commercial development in Venice.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL AID MOVE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision on moving a legal aid office from Pasadena to West Covina has been 
delayed at least until Monday while options that could keep the office in 
Pasadena are explored. 
</P>
<P>
Lauralea Saddick, executive director of Legal Services Programs for Pasadena 
and San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, said the organization has asked the city of 
Pasadena to help find space in city facilities or elsewhere in the northern 
part of Pasadena. The request was made after City Atty. Victor Kaleta appeared 
at the group's board meeting Tuesday to read a letter from Mayor William E. 
Thomson urging that the office remain in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Saddick said the lease on the office at 600 S. Lake Ave. expires at the end of 
the year and the organization is seeking cheaper quarters because of reduced 
funding for legal services. The recommended alternative, she said, is an office 
building at Cameron and Orange avenues in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's board will meet at 5:30 p.m. Monday at the El Monte 
Community Center to consider the matter. The legal aid program provides 
attorney services to low-income persons in civil matters. It handles about 
5,200 cases a year at its offices in Pasadena and Pomona.

MORRIS MARMON DIES; ACTIVE IN CIVIC AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morris Marmon, who as an activist, school board member, planning commissioner 
and firebrand newspaper columnist was one of the most influential figures in 
Culver City's politics for two decades, died at his home Sunday after a long 
illness. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Marmon, who served on the Board of Education from 1969-77 and on the Planning 
Commission from 1977-81, won friends and enemies in recent years with his 
column in the Culver City News in which he regularly assailed the City Council 
on issues such as overdevelopment, traffic congestion and rudeness to 
constituents. Some observers said he was a catalyst for the slow-growth 
movement that swept two longtime incumbents, Richard R. Brundo and Paul A. 
Netzel, from the council last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He single-handedly changed the whole complexion of politics in Culver City," 
said Councilman Jim Boulgarides, a councilman in the 1970s who decided to run 
again last year at the urging of his old campaign manager, Marmon. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism Marmon got for his views did not bother him, said Boulgarides. 
"He was serving the community, not himself." 
</P>
<P>
Syd Kronenthal, director of the city's Human Services Department, agreed, 
calling Marmon "the conscience of the community." 
</P>
<P>
"I think whether you agreed with Morris Marmon or not, what he did was get 
people moving," he said. "And I think an aroused public is a public that has 
good government." 
</P>
<P>
Long before he became active in city affairs, Marmon was a teacher, principal 
and regional administrator in the Los Angeles school system and was known for 
his student-first philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Blatt, now principal at Open Magnet School in the Fairfax District, 
recalled that when she was a teacher at Carthay Center School, Marmon, the 
principal, would always find excuses to work with her students, going with them 
on field trips or helping them build model boats for a regatta. 
</P>
<P>
"He made people believe in themselves," said Blatt. "He made mediocre teachers 
into beautiful, blossoming teachers by saying, 'Yes, yes, you can do it, you 
have the ability.' " 
</P>
<P>
"More people in the (Los Angeles Unified) School District consider him a mentor 
than any one person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marmon, who moved with his family from New York City to Los Angeles in 1936, 
was also active in religious affairs, serving as president of Temple Akiba in 
Culver City from 1965-67 and a religious school instructor at Sinai Temple in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He was buried Tuesday at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles. He is survived 
by his wife, Pamela; a son, Victor, of Malibu; daughters Lisa of North 
Hollywood and Cheryl of Culver City, and a sister, Billie Slutsky, of Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The family is asking that donations be made to the Los Angeles Educational 
Partnership, (attention: Leslie Dorman), 315 W. 9th St., Suite 1110, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90015; or the Culver City Morris Marmon Scholarship Fund, c/o 
Culver National Bank (attention: Debbie Harris), 5399 Sepulveda Blvd., Culver 
City, Calif. 90230.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL BACKS LIGHT RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alhambra City Council has endorsed a Los Angeles County proposal to build a 
mass-transit rail line in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Council members hope such a line will help reduce air pollution and ease 
freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rail system would consist of a light rail, or trolley-type 
service, from Los Angeles to Pasadena, and a commuter rail service running 
between Pasadena and San Bernardino. The transit system is required under the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District's air quality management plan. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which would cost an estimated $900 million, is awaiting approval by 
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, said Susan Rosales, senior 
rail development planner for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will decide in March which of two light-rail routes through the 
San Gabriel Valley should be approved, Rosales said. One route, which follows 
the Santa Fe tracks through Highland Park, is favored by South Pasadena. A 
second route, which runs along Main Street in Los Angeles before winding 
through El Sereno, is favored by Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
The planned transit project is backed by the San Gabriel Valley Assn. of 
Cities. In addition to Alhambra, Pasadena, Rosemead and Duarte have adopted 
resolutions supporting the project.

TENANTS BEAT EXIT DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer who evicted nearly all the apartment residents on the north side of 
an entire city block said that most of the tenants have vacated their 
apartments well before the Sept. 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The offer of a $1,000 bonus for leaving by July 31 helped speed the departure 
of about 100 residents, said a spokesman for Bancorp Development, which 
assembled the row of nine small buildings on Kiowa Avenue over the past year 
and a half. Only three tenants are left. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the bonus, tenants were to be paid relocation benefits required 
under city law, including a basic payment of $2,000 each and an additional 
$3,000 for disabled residents, those 62 or older, and parents with minor 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Bancorp Development has yet to decide whether apartments or condominiums will 
be built at the site once the 25-year-old buildings now occupying the north 
side of the block near San Vicente Boulevard are removed, the spokesman said.

READERS TAKE ISSUE WITH FREEWAY LINK AS A SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Mr. Ristic has forgotten that the Pasadena Freeway, which ends on 
Glenarm in Pasadena, cuts South Pasadena in two. Perhaps Mr. Ristic hasn't 
noticed that South Pasadena is a very small town, and barely has enough room to 
be cut in two, much less four parts. Perhaps Mr. Ristic hasn't noticed that 
freeways haven't been moving very freely lately, and are probably not going to 
be a long-term rapid transit solution.

<TEXT>
<P>
South Pasadena Mayor Pro Tem Evelyn Fierro's letter in The Times (Aug. 3) needs 
to be questioned because of some facts and figures she presented. Fierro 
stated: "The completion of the 710 Freeway will not . . . substantially relieve 
any traffic problems." 
</P>
<P>
Recent transportation studies indicate the 710 will operate with "severe 
congestion" the day it is completed. Current estimates put the number of cars 
at 180,000 per day. Taking 180,000 cars a day off other transportation arteries 
and onto the freeway should be viewed as a substantial reduction for people 
affected by the freeway runoff at the two 710 stubs. Traffic on Fremont Avenue 
will be reduced more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Fierro continues: "Caltrans will tell you the cost is $425 million . . . . It's 
basing its numbers on ancient history." Researching "ancient history" produced 
the following information: 
</P>
<P>
* A Caltrans environmental impact statement (circa 1976) estimated the total 
cost for an eight-lane freeway at $145.5 to $223.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
* A Caltrans second draft (environmental impact statement) (circa 1983) had 
increased the cost almost 100% to $442.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Three years later (1986) the third draft (environmental impact statement) 
came out and predicted the total cost for completing the 710 would be $425.5 
million, a $17.1-million reduction from the 1983 estimate. Could this be 
possible? 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year real estate values in South Pasadena have increased 41%. The 
cost for right-of-way purchases should reflect this increase. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, both South Pasadena and Caltrans have been engaged in a 
prolonged propaganda war at the public's expense. To paraphrase "Dragnet's" 
Sgt. Joe Friday, both entities should "just give us the facts!"

SCHOOL MEAL PRICES TO RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Board of Education voted Monday 
to increase the price of school lunches this fall to offset an expected 
shortage of government surplus food. 
</P>
<P>
The price of elementary school lunches will rise from $1.35 to $1.50; from 
$1.65 to $1.75 for secondary school lunches, and from $2 to $2.50 for adult 
lunches. Prices for prepaid lunches will remain $1.35 for elementary schools 
and $1.65 for secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
The district expects a 52% decrease in surplus cheese, fruits and other 
commodities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said food-service 
consultant Alita E. Rethmeyer.

BIG YELLOWTAIL AND MARLIN CONTINUE TO STRIKE THOSE HOOKS IN LOCAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers are flexing their muscles as summer fishing continues for heavy 
exotics. Impressive catches of yellowtail and marlin have been registered by 
South Bay fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
The half-day boat Redondo Special was returning to King Harbor, and while the 
crew was washing down the boat four large fish were churning the water. 
</P>
<P>
The deckhands baited up and tossed lines as the fish came within gaff reach. 
With the fish refusing bait, deckhand Rich Ricks reached down, free gaffed and 
brought one aboard. 
</P>
<P>
It was identified as a skipjack and weighed in at 20 pounds. Dan Armstrong in 
the Redondo Pier's sportfishing office said some skipjack in the 
four-to-five-pound class have been landed on the pier and harbor rocks but none 
as large as this one. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronado out of Long Beach Sportfishing on a trip to Catalina Island last 
weekend was on a move past the east end of the island when a kelp pattie with 
birds working around it was spotted. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach anglers Dennis Busse and Buster Bustamonte hooked up on first cast 
and landed two yellowtail. Joe Hoffman of Long Beach lost his yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Then Hoffman tossed a mackerel and a marlin came up and ran with the bait. The 
fish jumped 18 times as Hoffman with his 40-pound test line pumped and followed 
his fish around the deck 10 times. The boat moved to the fish and, after 20 
minutes, three gaffs and the boat's winch brought the striped marlin aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The sportfishing boat Pacifica, out of Long Beach, was on a three-day trip 95 
miles south of San Diego looking for elusive albacore and landed five that 
weighed only five pounds. However, 23 yellowtail made up the catch with Gardena 
angler Paul Johnston landing a 28-pound jackpot fish. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Karma and Eric Lunenschloss from Redondo Beach went shark fishing early 
Tuesday morning aboard Karma's boat, Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
The two anglers put out trolling lines five miles outside Palos Verdes on a 
slow troll when both lines got shark bites. One hit so hard it broke the boat's 
rod holder. Karma hand-lined the hooked shark and pulled it aboard. It was a 
blue shark that weighed in at 115 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The fish was dressed out and 19 shark steaks were donated for a fish fry. 
</P>
<P>
It's the fight -- not the catch -- that counts in the sixth annual Cancer 
Society's marlin shoot-out Friday through Sunday. The tournament is a tag and 
release event with fishing restricted to the waters within an area 70 miles off 
Catalina Island. 
</P>

South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Gus Hornett of Hermosa Beach, fishing aboard the Blackjack at Catalina, caught 
the whopper of the week, a 36-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Summers of West Los Angeles, aboard the Toronado at Catalina, won the 
jackpot when he pulled a 25-pound yellowtail out of the kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Itomora of West Los Angeles, on the Freedom at Catalina, caught a 19-pound 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Koyonagi of Gardena, fishing at the Oil Rigs aboard the Queen of the Sea, 
caught a 14-pound yellowtail. 
</P>

DISTRICT 13 ALL-STARS WIN 2 DIVISIONAL TITLES

Ventura County produced the best 15-year-old and 18-year-old Little League 
teams in Southern California this summer, and the 15-year-olds advanced to 
within one opponent of the World Series. It marked the first time that District 
13 (Oxnard to Thousand Oaks) has had two state divisional champions in the same 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley 15-year-olds defeated Everett, Wash., 16-13, and Spring 
Valley, Nev., 3-2, last week in the four-team Western Regional Senior League 
tournament after falling into the losers' bracket with a 14-4 loss to Union 
City, Calif. Union City eliminated Conejo Valley, 5-4, Friday and advanced to 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley (14-4) won district, sectional and divisional tournament 
championships to advance to the regional as the representative of Southern and 
Central California. 
</P>
<P>
The District 13 Big League team, composed mostly of players from Hueneme and El 
Rio, won seven consecutive games to sail through the sectional and divisional 
tournaments before losing two in a row last week at the Western Regionals in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Vince Reynoso, right fielder David Frazier, second baseman Adrian 
Estrada and left fielder Reyno Ortega were the top hitters for the Big League 
team. Julio Gonzalez, Tim Beal and David Soliz combined to do the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Four pitchers divided the work almost evenly for the Conejo Valley Senior team. 
Left-hander Chris Loll (4-1) pitched four complete games and left-hander Adam 
West (3-1) pitched two two-hit shutouts and struck out 44 in 32 1/3 innings. 
Right-hander Andy Bushart (4-1) led the staff by allowing only 38% of opposing 
batters to reach base. Right-hander Jeff Naster (3-1, two saves) led the team 
with a 1.62 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Ryan Kritscher and West -- who played first base when not 
pitching -- were the top Conejo Valley hitters. Kritscher, the leadoff batter, 
hit .500 (39 for 78), drove in a team-leading 20 runs, scored 22 runs and 
struck out only once in 86 plate appearances. West hit .413 and had eight 
doubles and three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Jeff Olin and catcher Cory Bowen each batted .339. Olin led the 
team with 11 stolen bases and Bowen had six extra-base hits. Outfielder Trent 
Martin batted .313 and shortstop Brian Capella batted .304 with 13 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Bryan Corey and third baseman Michael Moore helped bolster the 
Conejo Valley defense. Joe Liou batted .333 and had six stolen bases, Jim 
Colocchio batted .500 in a pinch-hitting role and Craig Arnold and Richard 
Murray each batted .333. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley showed a remarkable ability to overcome odds and win close games. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to Northridge, 15-2, in the sectional, the team came back to win 
three games, including two in a row over Northridge. Conejo Valley opened 
divisional play the following day and defeated San Diego, 8-0. In a 
second-round game, Rowland Heights, which had eliminated Conejo Valley two 
years ago in the 13-year-old tournament, took a 3-1 lead into the seventh 
inning. Conejo Valley rallied to tie the score and eventually won, 4-3, in nine 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
In its next game, Conejo Valley turned double plays with the bases loaded in 
the sixth and seventh innings of a 3-1 win over South El Monte and advanced to 
the championship round. South El Monte defeated Conejo Valley, 7-1, to force a 
championship game, which Conejo Valley won, 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
After dropping the regional opener to Union City, Conejo Valley outslugged 
Everett, which loaded the bases with none out in the seventh and failed to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Conejo Valley's last victory also included seventh-inning thrills. Spring 
Valley advanced a runner to third with one out but a suicide squeeze attempt 
failed and West struck out the final batter.

BACK FROM THE U.S.S.R., 60 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 60 years since the teen-aged Abe Stolar reluctantly left Chicago 
because his Russian-born Jewish parents wanted to go home. Stolar, an American 
citizen, thought he would return in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
Now at age 77, he has finally made it back. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles this week on a 15-city tour to thank Americans for helping get 
him out of the Soviet Union (he emigrated to Israel in March), Stolar tells a 
roller-coaster tale of his two worlds: inside and outside of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving inside, he was stripped of his U.S. passport and realized he would 
have a tough time getting out. But life there wasn't so bad, he says. His 
family had two rooms in a communal apartment. His father worked for an 
English-language newspaper. Stolar himself became a translator after going to 
school for four years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Hardships 
</P>
<P>
But in 1937, his father disappeared in one of Stalin's anti-Jewish purges. His 
sister's husband died in a labor camp. Stolar was fired from his prestigious 
job and given factory work. He served in the Red Army in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
And all the while, he dreamed of "outside." 
</P>
<P>
Fortune smiled again when Stalin died in 1953. Stolar became a translator for 
Radio Moscow, married Russian-Jewish chemist Gita Rozovskaya, and had a son. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived better than most," he recalls, because translators were considered an 
upper class. "They have more classes in that 'classless society' than do most 
countries in the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
But when his son, Michael, started school, Stolar started thinking seriously of 
getting out. "They were distorting my son's mind," he explains. And what was 
worse, "Jewish children could not get into any school of higher learning. My 
son had no future inside," because without a higher education, he would be 
relegated permanently to what might be called the lower class. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, however, Stolar admits, he had become a bit afraid of the 
"outside" world. "I half believed the lies I was translating every day. I asked 
my friends who emigrated to Israel to tell me what it was really like." 
</P>
<P>
Their reports were positive, and Stolar applied for his family's exit visas in 
1975, when his son was 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming a Nonperson 
</P>
<P>
The visas arrived -- "and what follows is very important for you to know," 
Stolar says, leaning forward in his chair: "You can't get an exit visa to 
Israel unless you relinquish your Soviet citizenship. And once you do that, you 
are branded automatically as a traitor to your country. You become undesirable 
and lose all your Soviet rights. You can't get mail, you can't work, you can't 
study, you can't marry, you can't travel. You have no documents in a country 
where every person is registered and documented." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, you don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
This would have been unimportant to the Stolars, except that they were snatched 
off the plane to Israel before it left Soviet soil. Their emigration papers 
were rescinded on the pretext that his wife, had done secret work. And the 
three Stolars lived as nonpersons for the next 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
They had shipped all their belongings to Israel. They had no money, no 
possessions and only the clothes on their backs. At first, they existed on the 
charity of friends, who brought food and clothes to the communal apartment to 
which the KGB had returned them. 
</P>
<P>
Then individuals and American Jewish groups, like The Jewish Federation Council 
of Greater Los Angeles, which hosted the Stolars' trip to Los Angeles this 
week, heard about the family's plight. Gifts started arriving, Stolar says, 
proudly pointing to his leather sandals, his plaid shirt and his Seiko watch. 
"Everything we own, everything we wear, we owe to those generous people." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Stolars were not allowed to work, tourists began arriving with 
merchandise they could sell to earn money. "Cameras, shoes, watches, tape 
recorders, ballpoint pens, art books, blue jeans," Stolar chants, recalling his 
undercover salesman days. They are all things that Soviets desperately want but 
can't buy "inside." 
</P>
<P>
Ballpoint pens? Yes, he explains, Soviet-made versions "just don't work" and 
American pens are "highly prized." Boots? "Soviet women love them, but the ones 
made in Russia are no good. They cost a few months' salary and they look like 
rags in five or six days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education for Son 
</P>
<P>
The higher education Stolar so desperately wanted for his son was, of course, 
not allowed. But "he is a good boy, a smart boy and he found a way to learn on 
his own, with the help of friends," Stolar says. Michael was not permitted to 
marry in the Soviet Union, so the Stolars managed to secretly import an 
American rabbi when he fell in love, "just so we could legitimize it in some 
way." Teaching religion to minor is against the law in the Soviet Union, Stolar 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Not an easy life. But neither Stolar nor his wife show signs of wear and tear. 
In fact, they seem cherubic, innocent, joyful. "I just saw my first computer 
last week," Stolar says with glee. Most Soviets have never seen one, even in a 
shop window, he adds. "Oh, perhaps some of the higher-up scientists have them," 
but not ordinary folks. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Stolar know that Americans had shot for the moon more than once. And he 
was surprised to learn that Americans take pictures with color film. "In 
Russia, it's all black-and-white. Color is hard to find, too expensive and 
takes weeks to process," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The Stolars seem to have lived whole lifetimes since they, their son and his 
family came "outside" in March, after appeals from former President Reagan and 
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.). When asked what the biggest difference is between 
inside the Soviet Union and outside, Stolar says it's certainly nothing 
material. "Outside you can think for yourself. In there, you can't think for 
yourself because you have no access to information. There is always something 
they are keeping from the people. They have thrown a curtain over the mind."

MAGAZINES: REDBOOK ISSUES A ROYAL CLIFFHANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Readers of the September Redbook -- which contains an excerpt of a children's 
story about a plucky little helicopter -- may wish their copy came equipped 
with an anti-aircraft missile. 
</P>
<P>
The weapon would be useful in venting the frustration or incredulity provoked 
by the slice of a forthcoming children's book by the Duchess of York, a.k.a. 
Fergie, wife of Britain's Prince Andrew, one of many heirs to the British 
throne. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Budgie the Little Helicopter," the three-page extract indicates that 
the story could well be titled "The Little Engine That Could Gets Rotor 
Blades." The tale opens with a bored Budgie -- his self-esteem in need of a 
lift -- lolling about his hangar. He meets a new aircraft, Pippa, a female 
Piper Warrior about to take her first flight. Off they go into the sky, where 
their carefree acrobatic play is soon darkened by an approaching thunderstorm. 
(It's not clear whether Budgie and Pippa filed a flight plan and checked the 
weather.) 
</P>
<P>
As the clouds move in they overhear an emergency radio call for Lionel -- the 
big tough helicopter who just happens to be out of touch at the moment -- to 
help in the search for a kidnaped little girl. Budgie and Pippa decide to do 
their bit, even though the control tower tells them they are "much too light 
and small" for a job that requires fully mature aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But first they have to get through those inconvenient, roiling, 
lightning-streaked clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"Budgie felt the first drops of rain and heard the thunder," writes the 
Duchess, who flies a helicopter herself. "As he watched the lightning approach, 
he couldn't help feeling frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Do they make it? 
</P>
<P>
Impossible to say because the excerpt stops there, followed by a note from the 
cunning editors -- none of whom apparently have children: "The exciting ending 
is revealed in The Duchess' book, of course." 
</P>
<P>
This teaser smacks of venality and marketing strategy, even though the magazine 
reports that a portion of the book's royalties will be donated to an 
unspecified charity. It also represents Redbook's gushing attitude toward 
Fergie that starts with the cover blurb proclaiming that the cover photo of the 
Duchess was taken by Prince Andrew "just for us." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a page of "Fascinating Fergie Facts" reveals a world record of sorts: 
"Fergie, by the way, holds a private pilot's license and a helicopter license 
-- the first royal lady ever to have either!" The editors also write that the 
Duchess' nanny is "a karate expert trained in self-defense against muggers, 
terrorists and kidnappers." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Budgie is cute and it's hard to hate an anthropomorphized helicopter 
who wears a baseball cap. But is Redbook's fawning necessary? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, unless parents rush out and buy the book -- to be published by Simon 
&amp; Schuster next month at $9.95 -- for their kids, no one can know whether 
Budgie and Pippa engineer a predictable daring rescue. Or if the Duchess has 
the artistic courage to send the two little flyers on a valorous but doomed 
mission. Which at least would nip the dread possibility of sequels and further 
excerpts in Redbook. 
</P>
<P>
As cruel fate would have it, the "Fergie Facts" page notes that the Duchess 
already has launched a second installment in Great Britain, "Budgie At 
Bendick's Point." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Bendick's Point is a convalescent hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the royal front, this week's People reports that the Duke and 
Duchess of York briefly jumped into trouble with their environmentally minded 
subjects. The uproar began when a newspaper reported that the pair gave their 
daughter, Princess Bea, a $3,270 rocking horse "made of mahogany from the 
endangered Brazilian rain forests" for her first birthday. Not true, Buckingham 
Palace retorted, explaining that the horse was a present to the baby from a toy 
firm before her birth. "So there is no question of the Duke and Duchess of York 
ordering and buying it, or choosing a special type of timber," the Palace said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Refugees 
</P>
<P>
In Stockton, the father of an 8-year-old Cambodian girl, one of five youngsters 
killed by gunman Patrick Purdy in a school yard last January, watches -- over 
and over -- a videotape of his daughter's funeral. A survivor of 
institutionalized slaughter in Southeast Asia, the father cannot let go of his 
anger and grief over the death of his child in America, despite the 
ministrations of mental-health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in California, Salvadoran refugee Heber Hernandez dreams of friends 
assassinated in the early 1980s by El Salvador's death squads. In the dream, 
Hernandez says he tells one friend, " 'But Felipe,' I said, 'I am sure you are 
dead.' And he told me, 'No, that's a lie.' So I said, 'Well, then where is 
Joaquin, our friend who was killed?' And Felipe says, 'He's fine, too. Don't 
believe what they tell you. We are alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
These are two vignettes from the troubling but enlightening spring-summer issue 
of California Tomorrow, which is devoted to the mental-health issues facing the 
state's ethnically diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the issue in an editorial, California Tomorrow president Lewis H. 
Butler maintains that California's perennially overloaded, financially strapped 
mental-health system has been unable to cope with the problems of immigrants 
and refugees. " . . . These concerns are compounded by the strains and 
complexities of building a workable multiethnic state. War trauma and culture 
shock have been added to the list of social ills afflicting Californians," 
Butler writes. 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to argue that Western and Anglo concepts of mental health may have 
to be redefined. "Clearly, in our communities, we must tap traditional sources 
of strength and healing," Butler maintains. "We have to turn to families and 
churches and tribes and elders and caring individuals, all of whom can be 
assisted by professionals but not replaced by them." 
</P>
<P>
A compilation of statistics at the front of the magazine illustrates the scope 
of the state's mental-health needs. For instance, among California's population 
of 7 million children under age 18, it is estimated that as many as 1.06 
million need some type of mental-health services. In the state's largest cities 
more than 15% of babies are born addicted to drugs or alcohol. Two years ago an 
assessment of the mental-health needs of Southeast Asian immigrants estimated 
that almost 28% were in "severe need" of mental-health assistance, compared 
with 3% of the general population. 
</P>
<P>
California Tomorrow, according to co-editor Bruce K. Kelley, is an outgrowth of 
a nonprofit organization of the same name founded six years ago to "promote 
issues of changing demographics and ethnic diversity" within the state. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the quarterly has been distributed free to members of the 
legislature; locally elected officials and their staffs, and selected business, 
community and education leaders, Kelley said. With the latest issue, however, 
he added that the magazine is seeking to convert some of its readership to paid 
subscribers. However, the old ways die hard, he said, noting that anyone who 
calls up will be mailed a free copy. Cheapskates can call (213) 623-6231. 
Earnest, financially responsible subscribers may send a check for $25 (or more) 
to California Tomorrow, 315 W. 9th St., Suite 110005, Los Angeles, Calif. 
90015.

ERMA BOMBECK: WHERE IT'S CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when I thought it was safe to leave the house again, some nuts in West 
Germany want to observe Christmas twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
You can almost guess where they're coming from. They're all members of a Father 
Christmas Union who say they can't make a living "coming to town" only once a 
year. They marched on Hamburg recently, demanding that a second Christmas be 
celebrated July 24 so they can earn more money. 
</P>
<P>
As I told my son when he won a pool at the office by picking more Academy Award 
winners than anyone else, "Don't get your hopes up, kid, it's seasonal work." 
</P>
<P>
I know people out there who at this moment have their Christmas cards bought, 
gifts squirreled away, and fruitcakes soaking up booze faster than George 
Hamilton soaks up the sun. I am happy to say I don't know them well. Maybe some 
people can get their acts together in seven months, but I'm on a different 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
From Dec. 26 to Jan. 15, I buy at half-price my wrapping paper, ribbon and 
Christmas cards to store away in a "safe" place where I will never find them 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 20 through Feb. 1, I return Christmas gifts to stores whose 
salespeople acknowledge only that it is their box but have never seen the 
merchandise in their entire 30 years at the store. 
</P>
<P>
March 3 through the 25th, I take down the last of the Christmas decorations 
outside. From April through May, I accept catalogue merchandise on back order 
and that I no longer need, having replaced them with other gifts following Dec. 
23 panic. I bundle up and return merchandise to catalogue companies for credit. 
</P>
<P>
May 25 to June 15 is major decisions time. Do I toss out fruitcakes I received 
as gifts or use them to build a gazebo? Do I toss out Christmas cards or save 
them until someone comes up with an idea of what to do with them? Do I freeze 
the remaining candy I got for Christmas or polish off the two pieces left and 
pitch the box? 
</P>
<P>
June 23: Make final payments on charges for Christmas purchases. 
</P>
<P>
June 24: Turn on television and see Santa Claus ho ho-ing there are only 30 
days left before July Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
June 24: Check warranty on TV set to see if it is covered for owner's foot 
accidentally kicking in the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of two Christmases will never fly. If it had a chance, merchants would 
have put a second one into motion years ago. Proponents seem to have forgotten 
we need permission from a higher authority. After all, whose birthday is it, 
anyway?

PULLING AN OVERNIGHTER IN BUSH WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNIE RADCLIFFE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a story -- not apocryphal -- about the night in January 1967 when 
George and Barbara Bush's furniture arrived in Washington from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
A snowstorm was in progress as the moving van pulled up at the Bushes' 
Hillbrook Lane home shortly before midnight. The movers managed to unload the 
mattresses and bedding but not much more before the Bushes called a halt, 
invited them to spend the night and sent everybody off to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody remembers the movers' names, but they surely rank first among equals in 
that exclusive group of Bush insiders on social Washington's much coveted 
A-list. Twenty-two years later, when invitations to dinner or a movie at the 
White House are as common as a Washington rumor, overnighting with the Bushes 
is the new measure of status. Only a select few, toothbrush and pajamas in 
hand, make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
They're not necessarily famous or rich or even powerful, though many are all 
three. Most are family members or Bush friends -- usually old friends, 
occasionally new friends, but always loyal friends. Friends such as Kentucky 
horse breeder Will Farish, Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, Pennzoil 
executive committee chairman Baine Kerr, fellow Yale Skull and Bonesman Thomas 
W. Moseley, and childhood friend FitzGerald Bemiss -- to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Were there such a thing as an A-plus list, theirs would be among the names on 
it, for they, not kings or presidents, have been sleeping royally in the 
Queen's and Lincoln bedrooms during the seven months the Bushes have been 
living in the White House. And if those second-floor bedrooms were filled, they 
moved up to the third-floor family quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a storybook experience," confirms Shirley Pettis, the former California 
representative who was a Bush neighbor here for 10 years. The Bushes invited 
Pettis and her husband, Ben Roberson, to stay with them during a trip to 
Washington in May. Shown to the Queen's Bedroom, where five queens have slept 
in Andrew Jackson's handsome four-poster bed, they were overwhelmed by the 
historic surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"Every place you turn there is a sense of your forebears," says Pettis, equally 
impressed by how thoroughly her hostess had done her research. "Bar makes you 
feel you must know everything about this wonderful house, and because she knows 
every piece and can tell its story, the whole floor comes alive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Gracious Staff 
</P>
<P>
Pampered by what Pettis describes as one of the world's most gracious household 
staffs, guests find all the amenities of a luxury hotel -- and then some. There 
are heavy terry-cloth robes in the bathrooms, crisp white stationery engraved 
with "The President's House" on the desks, bouquets of fresh flowers everywhere 
and the best security system in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Guests also are faced with such big decisions as whether to unpack their own 
bags or let the staff do it; what to order for breakfast (menu cards are left 
in their rooms each evening), and where to eat it -- in their rooms or the East 
Sitting Hall. Pettis and her husband chose the latter and were enjoying the 
morning sun when who should come over to join them for a cup of tea but the 
President himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He came romping down the hall. Fortunately, I was wearing my prettiest 
peignoir," says an amused Pettis, who remembers that same spontaneous nature 
from when she and the late California representative Jerry Pettis lived next 
door to another freshman congressman, then-Texas Rep. George Bush, on Palisade 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
There are tales of other unexpected encounters. One house guest, awakened by 
gentle but persistent tapping on the door, heard Bush outside inquiring, "Is 
anybody up in there?" Another said it wasn't unusual for the President to 
casually warn that he was taking someone through the room "so make sure you 
don't have anything sitting around." 
</P>
<P>
Even if for only a night or two, living amid history takes some getting used 
to. Jack Steele of Houston, longtime Bush friend and a confessed Walter 
Mitty-type at heart, says he had trouble sleeping his first night in the 
Lincoln Bedroom so he stayed up looking at the Washington Monument and writing 
notes at the desk where Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't the only one who's had trouble sleeping. Houston friends David and Ann 
Peake were put up in the Queen's Bedroom, where the original copy of "The Star 
Spangled Banner" hangs on one wall. In the morning, Peake -- a friend of 
Barbara Bush from her childhood in Rye, N.Y. -- asked his wife -- a history 
buff -- if she'd slept well. "Not particularly," she replied. "What a waste of 
time!" 
</P>
<P>
Some guests -- like the Peakes and Baine and Mildred Kerr -- have been invited 
to spend the night after a state dinner. Sadruddin Aga Khan, a former United 
Nations official and tennis friend to whom Bush turned recently in the current 
hostage crisis, stayed the night that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
was an official visitor in June. Invited to stay after other state dinners were 
country singer Crystal Gayle; Steve Fisher, coach of the national college 
basketball champion University of Michigan Wolverines; and Bush cousins John 
and Shelley Jansing of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Another recent guest was New York socialite Mildred Hilson, the Bushes' Waldorf 
Towers neighbor when George Bush was ambassador to the United Nations in the 
early '70s. Barbara Bush's favorite interior designer, Mark Hampton of New 
York, has stayed, too. So have all the Bushes' children and grandchildren, most 
of the Bushes' siblings, and many of their nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes are similarly generous with their invitations to Camp David. Their 
firstborn, George Walker Bush, and his wife, Laura, up from Texas for the Texas 
Rangers' three-game series with the Baltimore Orioles, and Bush cousins Craig, 
Debbie and Walker Stapleton, down from Connecticut, spent last weekend with the 
Bushes there. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members and their spouses, and some key presidential aides, have been 
weekend guests. Some non-family guests, such as Jack Steele, are also twofers 
-- welcome at both the White House and the Catoctin Mountains retreat. Steele 
describes that setting as "glorious -- we walked in the woods and that night 
sat with our feet up and watched a movie." 
</P>
<P>
For the unathletic, the pace is relaxed; for others, it's highly competitive, 
as when Bush invited Pam Shriver and a group for a recent weekend of tennis. 
Bush also likes "wally ball," a corrupted version of volleyball played on a 
squash court. Even before Marine One, the presidential helicopter, touches 
ground, Bush, sometimes with his grandchildren in tow, starts marshaling the 
troops to suit up and report for jogging. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, by contrast, is a bit more formal. Everyone is on best 
behavior, and those who aren't can expect a refresher course. At dinner time 
recently when the First Lady realized that her twin granddaughters, Jenna and 
Barbara Bush (George W. and Laura Bush's children), were not at the table, she 
asked the butler if he knew where they were. In the bowling alley, he informed 
her, waiting to be served. They didn't wait much longer. Barbara Bush ordered 
them back to the family quarters by sending word that Bush grandchildren do not 
eat in the bowling alley, they eat with the family in the dining room. She also 
warned the White House staff to beware of young charm artists. 
</P>
<P>
There are also rules at the family's Walker's Point compound in Kennebunkport, 
but, according to Barbara Bush, no one keeps them. She has posted notes such 
as: "Picnics should be planned early for the beach," and "Please pick up wet 
towels and use them twice," and "Please be down for breakfast between 7 and 9 
or no breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
"You're so absorbed into their activities that you don't think of yourself as a 
visitor because you become an instant member of the family," says former Bush 
spokesman Pete Roussel, who has stayed at Walker's Point several times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decades of Guests 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes have been putting up house guests in their 15-room, seven-bath, 
stone-and-shingle "cottage" there for almost a decade. Before that, they put 
them up at the house they owned across the road. Bush's family has been 
spending summers at Kennebunkport since the 1880s and at Walker's Point since 
1902, when it was bought by the President's grandfather. Dorothy Walker Bush, 
the President's mother, still has a cottage within the compound. 
</P>
<P>
It is George Bush's favorite place on earth -- "politics be damned," he says 
fearlessly -- and perhaps the most coveted overnight of all. French President 
Francois Mitterrand has already spent the night -- in a rented king-size bed 
for which Barbara Bush herself brought in the sheets, according to the 
furniture store owner who supplied it. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the doorstep is being swept in preparation for an an Aug. 24 
overnight visit by Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and his wife, Anne 
Marie Vessel, and an Aug. 30 overnight visit by Canadian Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney and his wife, Mila, and their children, Caroline, 15; Benedict, 13; 
Mark, 10, and Nicholas, 3. 
</P>
<P>
The Schlueter and Mulroney visits raise prospects for yet another A-plus list 
category, this one of world leaders whom Bush might single out for more 
intimate get-togethers than are possible during the highly ceremonial state and 
official visits. 
</P>
<P>
"You can avoid misunderstandings if you can go one-on-one in a relaxed, 
personal way," Bush has said. 
</P>
<P>
The Schlueters are stopping on their way to Mexico, where they're making an 
official visit. Schlueter and Bush have been friendly since they met in 1982, 
and when the new Danish ambassador mentioned the Mexico trip as he was 
presenting his credentials at the White House earlier this month, Bush extended 
the invitation on the spot. The Mulroney invitation grew out of an expansive 
moment in Paris last month when the company-loving President invited his 
Canadian neighbor to bring the wife and kids down from Ottawa for a few days in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
In a mood of similar unsuppressed hospitality at the Tokyo funeral of Emperor 
Hirohito in February, Bush invited France's Mitterrand and his wife, Danielle, 
to be overnight house guests. The Mitterrands came in May on their way to 
Boston, where honorary degrees awaited both Mitterrand and Bush at Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's Point guests can expect a rigorous workout. Mitterrand, not usually 
identified with informality or sports, nonedheless brought along his corduroys, 
plaid shirt and hiking boots for a walk with his host in the mosquito- and 
black-fly-infested woods nearby. When Bush invited him to take a spin in his 
high-speed Cigarette boat, Mitterrand, who gets seasick, declined and headed 
indoors for a rest. 
</P>
<P>
Schlueter plays some tennis and likes to bike, and Mulroney is the All-Canadian 
Boy type who reportedly likes horseshoes, boating, fishing, tennis (he met his 
wife at a Montreal tennis club) and just about any other sport, except golf, 
that Bush might propose. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney is also an all-star first baseman, as he proved earlier this summer 
when he was named "most valuable player" during a charity softball appearance 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bush is no slouch with the horsehide himself, a pickup game featuring 
Bush and Mulroney on opposing teams would surprise no one at all.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: TALLER TIMBER AT THE SALT LAKE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Since 1985 the Family History Library has nearly doubled its annual rate of 
microfilming original sources," David M. Mayfield, director of the genealogical 
library in Salt Lake City, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
The library now has 175 microfilming projects in 40 counties, and in 1988 alone 
completed about 85 million exposures of original records which list an 
estimated 700 million deceased persons throughout the world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the major acquisitions for this library in the U.S. and Canada 
sections alone included: 745,000 files of federal passport applications 
(1795-1918), 1.8 million cards of Canadian border crossings (1895-1924), a 
portion of the 24 million World War I draft registration cards, selected 
federal district and circuit court naturalization records, compiled Confederate 
service records, plus records in 94 county courthouses and six state archives. 
</P>
<P>
There is high priority on acquiring parish registers dating back to the early 
1500s in the British Isles. Recent acquisitions include: a general probate 
index for all English courts (1812-1858); post-1858 probate documents, 
including indexes for all of England and Wales (1858-1957); civil registration 
indexes of births, marriages and deaths (1837-1980); Scottish probate indexes 
(1846-1935); records of Royal Marines and other seamen (1755-1900) and about 
half of the Irish Catholic church records (1780-1880). 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 edition of the International Genealogical Index is now available in 
family history branches worldwide. It contains the names of more than 147 
million people dating back to the early 1500s. The new edition includes 19 
million names extracted primarily from birth and marriage records of North 
America -- including 2.3 million from Massachusetts, 2.3 million from Ohio, 
987,000 from Tennessee, 942,000 from New York, 81,000 from Pennsylvania and 
86,372 from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its sixth year, the Family Registry includes nearly 260,000 entries. 
These consist of individuals, mostly from North America, who wish to cooperate 
with others researching specific lines. The Family Registry is on microfiche 
and also is available at most branch family history libraries. Salt Lake's 
Family History Library card catalogue has been converted to an automated 
system, with most branch libraries now using the 1988 edition of this 
microfiche catalogue that you use to order microform from the main library. 
</P>
<P>
The main library is developing and testing a patron access to the main 
library's card catalogue data which is on compact disks. This computerized 
access offers some important and quick aids to researchers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When searching for a specific locality you need not know each of the 
jurisdictional levels (i.e., country, state, county and city); the computer 
will conveniently lead you to what you are searching for, based on what you 
already know (city where an ancestor was born, for example). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The computer automatically provides cross-references from subject headings 
that you think of, to those used in the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When you request a surname search, the computer automatically provides 
phonetic equivalents of the surname, increasing your chances of finding 
information filed under various spellings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It automatically searches for key words in the notes and titles of the 
catalogue records. If you are looking for information on the Case family, the 
computer will refer you to books about the Midgley or King families in which 
there is information about Case lines. This access to so-called "hidden 
genealogies" is of tremendous value to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can obtain a printout of the information displayed on the computer 
screen by using the printer.

FIRST COURSE FOR A FALL ART FEAST; 
</P>
<P>
SOTHEBY'S TO SELL WORKS FROM LATE SOUP MAGNATE'S COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heat of summer is still very much with us, but the sellers and buyers of 
the big-ticket art auction circuit are already looking ahead to a sizzling fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of that development is on view at Sotheby's Beverly Hills, which has 
unveiled a high-end sampling of a $100-million auction upcoming in New York. 
The local preview, continuing through Tuesday, features 24 Impressionist 
paintings from the collection of the late John T. Dorrance Jr., the former 
chairman of the Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
A late Vincent van Gogh painting, depicting a woman awaiting the return of her 
sailor husband, and one of Claude Monet's "Haystack" paintings are the most 
expensive works exhibited. The Van Gogh is valued at $10 million to 
</P>
<P>
$15 million; the Monet is expected to bring between $7 million and $9 million. 
Big bucks, but not enough to surpass Van Gogh's record of $53.9 million (for 
"Irises") or Monet's record of $24.5 million (for "In the Prairie"). 
</P>
<P>
The auction itself is billed as a potential record-breaker, however. Sotheby's 
expects the four-day sale (Oct. 18-21) of about 1,000 objects to exceed 
Christie's $85-million auction of 28 Impressionist and modern paintings from 
the William and Edith Mayer Goetz collection. The Goetz sale in 1988 holds the 
record for a single collection sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance, who died in April, collected a vast array of fine and decorative arts 
-- from Old Master paintings to European ceramics, French and English 
furniture, silver and Chinese jade. The local exhibition will showcase only the 
most valuable pieces, the Impressionist paintings that form the centerpiece of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a true Impressionist collection. It represents all of the 
Impressionist artists, most of them with very strong work," said Diana D. 
Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America. "You rarely see in one collection 
works by Renoir, Degas, Monet, Gauguin, Fantin-Latour -- the whole gamut -- and 
then continue into the 20th Century with Picasso and Matisse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its wide range, the collection "fits together well" and shows a 
"consistency of taste," Brooks said. One reason is that many of the works were 
screened by the eye of a single vendor. Dorrance bought most of the paintings 
from Nicholas and William Acquavella, at their Acquavella Galleries in New 
York, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh, "L'Homme est en Mer," depicts a woman rocking her baby and gazing 
into a fire. The artist painted it in 1889, the year before his death, while 
incarcerated at a mental asylum in Saint-Remy. The 26x20-inch oil was done 
after a reproduction of a painting, probably sent to Van Gogh by his brother 
Theo. Van Gogh often worked from reproductions at Saint-Remy, but he 
interpreted loosely and added his own color. In October, 1989, he wrote to 
Theo, "I have copied that 'Woman With a Child Sitting by a Hearth,' by Mme. 
Dumont-Breton, almost all in violet. I am certainly going on copying, that will 
give me a collection of my own, and when this is large and complete enough, I 
shall give the whole to a school." 
</P>
<P>
"Meules, Effet de Neige, le Matin" is part of Monet's renowned series of 
haystack paintings, depicting stacks of grain near his property at Giverny in 
different seasons and at various times of day. This particular canvas was 
painted on a winter morning in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other top lots in the local exhibition are "Au Moulin Rouge," a 1901 
cabaret scene by Pablo Picasso, and Monet's 1877 landscape, "La Berge a 
Argenteuil" (both valued at $6 million to $8 million). Another Monet landscape 
on view, "Bords de la Seine, un Coin de Berge," is expected to bring between $5 
million and $7 million. Two other paintings are each valued at $4 million to $5 
million: "Danseuses" (circa 1895-1900), one of Edgar Degas' trademark paintings 
of dancers, and Henri Mastisse's "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge, Assise de Profil" 
(circa 1919-20), depicting a seated woman on a balcony, seen through the French 
doors of a Nice hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance, whose father, John T. Dorrance, invented condensed soup, was chairman 
of Campbell Soup Co. for 22 years before his retirement in 1984. He collected 
art over a period of about 30 years, acquiring most of his Impressionist 
pictures in the '60s and '70s. The collection has been well known in art 
circles. Dorrance was chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art at his death 
and he occasionally loaned works to traveling exhibitions. His Picasso, "Au 
Moulin Rouge," was in the Museum of Modern Art's massive Picasso retrospective 
in 1980 and Matisse's "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge" appeared at the National 
Gallery's 1986-87 exhibition, "Henri Matisse, the Early Years in Nice." 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance displayed most of his collection at his home in Gladwyne, Pa. He 
donated some works of art to the Philadelphia Museum of Art during his 
lifetime, but gave only a few ceramic pieces to the museum at his death, Brooks 
said. Except for those ceramics and some porcelains kept by family members, his 
entire collection will go on the block in October. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition at Sotheby's, 308 N. Rodeo Drive, is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
today through Saturday and Monday and Tuesday; Sunday hours are 1 to 5 p.m. The 
show is the first event in Sotheby's recently doubled exhibition space. The new 
galleries will be used for lectures, luncheons and dinners, as well as 
exhibitions, to more firmly establish Sotheby's presence in Los Angeles, Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Beverly Hills, the Dorrance preview will travel to Paris, Zurich, 
Tokyo and Philadelphia. The entire collection will go on view in New York a few 
days before the mid-October auction.

ONE MAN'S CRUSADE TO REHIRE A DEEJAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His day-glo orange business card lists his various occupations -- tax adviser, 
business consultant, piano player, marathon runner and stand-up comic -- and 
now Larry Greenblatt can add another to his list of specializations: deejay 
promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Greenblatt, 38, is a man obsessed. An accountant by day, at night he haunts 
local concert halls and comedy clubs in a quest to reinstate his favorite 
deejay, Peter Tilden, to the air waves. 
</P>
<P>
Tilden, the host of the morning show on KLSX-FM (97.1), was fired on July 12 
after eight months on the air. KLSX General Manager Bob Moore said the ratings 
on Tilden's show plummeted and surveys indicated that listeners wanted less 
talk and more music on the classic rock station. Tilden was replaced by former 
KMET jock David Perry and Kate Hayes on the morning shift. 
</P>
<P>
If you've been to a pop music concert in the last three weeks, you've 
undoubtedly run across Greenblatt and his petition. So far, Greenblatt has 
collected 6,000 signatures, including those of Mayor Tom Bradley, NBC 
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff and rocker Edgar Winter. 
</P>
<P>
Greenblatt's goal is 25,000 signatures. He plans to take the petition to KLSX 
in hopes of getting Tilden rehired; failing that, he said he will carry it "to 
every TV and radio station that will hear me in town." 
</P>
<P>
Sounding like a cross between a carnival barker and a slick, high-pressure 
salesman, Greenblatt attracted a fair amount of attention Tuesday night outside 
the Greek Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, folks, we're back. The one-man crusade is here," he proclaimed. "We're 
trying to get Peter Tilden back on the radio, the local deejay who was fired." 
</P>
<P>
When Greenblatt approached a 30-ish man, the low-key response was typical: "I 
never heard of this guy. Why was he fired?" 
</P>
<P>
"Low ratings." 
</P>
<P>
The man signed. 
</P>
<P>
Greenblatt's affinity for Tilden is multifaceted. He said he began listening to 
the 6-10 a.m. program in an effort to get over a failed love affair. It worked. 
Tilden's humor brought him out of his depression, he said. Tilden also gave 
Greenblatt a shot on his show as "Greenblatt, the Singing Accountant." 
Greenblatt, who bears a resemblance to Woody Allen, provided tax tips in song. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, Greenblatt, who said he has devoted some 150 hours to 
reinstating Tilden, explained that, "When I wake up in the morning, I want to 
hear a guy with half a brain. . . . Peter Tilden just brightened the lives of 
thousands of thinking people." 
</P>
<P>
Said a young woman picnicking outside the Greek Theatre: "I used to listen to 
him. I thought he was pretty funny. I'll sign." 
</P>
<P>
A pair of young women, when informed of a common complaint against Tilden, 
asked Greenblatt: "Did he talk too much?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," Greenblatt said. "I think he had a lot to say." 
</P>
<P>
The two women signed. 
</P>
<P>
"All over America, people are coming together to bring Peter Tilden back on the 
radio," Greenblatt yelled to no one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is coming together, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who he is," said one man as he declined. "He's just not 
well-known." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't sign for the Pope of Rome," said another. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, I listen to Ken and Bob (on KABC-AM)," said a third. 
</P>
<P>
Tilden, who is writing scripts for a television sitcom, producing radio and 
television commercials and looking for another radio gig, said he's heard of 
Greenblatt's one-man campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I go somebody tells me, 'You know, I ran into this guy with this 
petition,' " Tilden said Wednesday in a phone interview. "It's great. I'm just 
real flattered that people still remember who I am. Usually, when you go off 
the air, that's the last time you hear of someone." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm flattered that he's doing it," Tilden said. "I just hope he doesn't get in 
trouble and he doesn't bother too many people." 
</P>
<P>
Greenblatt did have a run-in with the Los Angeles Police Department outside the 
Greek Theatre. Six officers informed Greenblatt that he was trespassing on 
private property by standing near the entrance with his petition. 
</P>
<P>
But the incident only made him more determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm allowed at the Universal Amphitheatre, I'm allowed at the Wiltern Theatre, 
I don't know why I'm not allowed at the Greek Theatre," he said. "I'm up 
against this a lot -- a lot of abuse. I have to harness it into positive 
energy. The more that these cops harass me, the harder I work to get Peter back 
on the radio."

ELTON JOHN AT THE FORUM: A MAN WITHOUT A GIMMICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the thunderous audience response during Elton John's show at the Forum on 
Tuesday, you'd think that the veteran pop star hadn't performed in Los Angeles 
in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, John sold out three shows at the Hollywood Bowl less than 11 months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Then he must be riding a big comeback hit? 
</P>
<P>
No. John's coming album, "Sleeping With the Past," won't be released until the 
end of the month. And his last album, "Reg Strikes Back," didn't exactly set 
the the pop world on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Then, surely, he must have decided to reintroduce the outrageous costumes and 
flamboyant stage presence that he put in mothballs a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong again. John hardly moved from his electric piano, and he wore just two 
suits during the entire show -- granted, one was lavender and the other was 
lime green. 
</P>
<P>
So what accounted for the frequently tumultuous response? 
</P>
<P>
The songs. 
</P>
<P>
John's 2 1/2-hour show drew its strength almost completely from the quality and 
diversity of his music. 
</P>
<P>
For most acts, pacing a show means simply alternating ballads and up-tempo 
songs. But John's remarkably diverse repertoire allowed him to move from the 
spacey funk of "Bennie and the Jets" to the classically shaded elegance of 
"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"; from the feel-good pop of "Philadelphia 
Freedom" to the swaggering, rave-up rock of "The Bitch Is Back" -- which was 
made even hotter Tuesday with the inclusion of several bars of the Rolling 
Stones' "Brown Sugar." 
</P>
<P>
John also struck just the right balance between engaging but disposable ear 
candy like last year's "I Don't Wanna Go on With You Like That" and more 
challenging, ambitious works like the symphonic rock piece "Funeral for a 
Friend/Love Lies Bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old singer/songwriter focused on crowd-pleasing oldies in the first 
hour. Nine of the first 12 songs dated from 1976 or before. The night's biggest 
ovation was for the graceful ballad "Candle in the Wind," which John introduced 
16 years ago. The mere mention, early in the show, of the 1973 album "Goodbye 
Yellow Brick Road" got a big hand. 
</P>
<P>
But this was no idle stroll down memory lane. John and his five-man backup band 
pumped up the arrangements of several of the songs and thoroughly revamped two 
of them. His bluesy funk version of the 1972 pop hit "Rocket Man" bore little 
resemblance to the original. And John has turned his sing-songy 1984 hit "Sad 
Songs (Say So Much)" into a muscular, gospel-flavored rocker. 
</P>
<P>
And the balance shifted to newer material in the second hour. There were no 
songs at all in the show from the years 1977-81, when John was in a commercial 
and artistic slump. 
</P>
<P>
John told the audience that his coming album was inspired by R&amp;B songs that 
he and longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin enjoyed when they were growing up. 
</P>
<P>
You'd never know it, however, from the four songs he previewed Tuesday. The 
album's first single, "Healing Hands," is a crafty mix of pop and rock 
elements, but the title song is far too pat and polite. John never came close 
to cutting loose, much less working up a sweat. What kind of R&amp;B is that? 
</P>
<P>
It once seemed that the secret to John's success as a concert performer was his 
over-the-top showmanship, which made him the Liberace of rock. 
</P>
<P>
There must have been times over the years when John worried that if he ever put 
aside the costumes and the props and the antics, fans would gradually lose 
interest. Perhaps, he must have feared, it was the outrageousness and the high 
jinks that intrigued them. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the strong response Tuesday must have been especially gratifying. 
When a visibly moved John told the audience, "You've touched me very deeply 
tonight and I thank you," one could almost see those old fears evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
When John then launched into the proud, chest-thumping "I'm Still Standing," it 
was no idle boast. 
</P>
<P>
John's sold-out, three-night Forum stand is set to conclude Friday. He's slated 
to play the Pacific Amphitheatre on Saturday.

A DIRECTOR'S 20-YEAR TREK TO THE BIG SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has been honored with every major directing award advertising has to offer. 
He has directed television commercials with Michael Jackson, Madonna, Michael 
J. Fox, Bo Jackson, Michael Jordan and E.T. His client list reads like a Who's 
Who of International Business, and includes Pepsi, Apple Computer, Nike, 
Perrier, Michelob and John Hancock Mutual Life. 
</P>
<P>
But it took almost 20 years and six aborted, self-financed film projects before 
the daring, controversial Joe Pytka, now 50, was able to accomplish his highest 
aspiration -- to direct a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Pytka's dramatic comedy, "Let It Ride," opens Friday. The film, starring 
Richard Dreyfuss, is about the wild and woolly winning streak of a compulsive, 
down-on-his-luck gambler at the horse races. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount is treating Pytka's big-screen debut like a dark horse by scheduling 
its press screenings on Friday. Screening a film the day it opens is a tactic 
normally reserved for critical disappointments, because it assures that a 
film's reviews will not appear until after its opening weekend. The last 
picture Paramount opened in that fashion was "Friday the 13th Part VIII." 
</P>
<P>
"We just finished the film," and got the final print ready early last week, 
Pytka said in defense of the studio and his film. "We were geared up to open in 
September, then the studio moved it up a month to make it a summer film. So I 
believe they have high hopes for it. They're spending a lot of money 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Pytka is buoyed that the trailer for "Let It Ride" is getting laughs in 
theaters. Still, he admits that he is full of anxieties about how audiences and 
critics will respond to his work. The impatient Pytka is forced into playing a 
waiting game uncharacteristic to the advertising field. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful aura of stories that swirl about the director have become 
advertising folklore. One executive tells of the time Pytka challenged a 
creative director he was working with to a basketball game to decide a creative 
issue. The creative director reputedly walked away from the game with a broken 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off the Airwaves 
</P>
<P>
When shooting a $2-million Pepsi commercial at the Shrine Auditorium in Los 
Angeles, a pyrotechnical special effect accidentally set Michael Jackson's hair 
on fire. Pytka's two-minute Pepsi commercial featuring Madonna dancing and 
singing "Like a Prayer" inside a church was yanked off the airwaves last spring 
at the insistence of angry Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
In the conference room of his commercial-production company in Venice, Pytka, 
who stands an imposing 6-feet-4, calmly shakes off negative criticism. He says 
Madonna's commercial was one of the best things he's ever done, and expresses 
frustration with critics who "miss the point." 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody missed the point. Between 1986 and 1988, Pytka's commercial 
production company, which he runs with his brother, John Pytka, was named the 
best at the Cannes Film Festival. In those same years Joe Pytka also took home 
a carload of Clios, the advertising industry's equivalent of Oscars, for his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Considering his talent and notoriety, why has it taken Pytka so long to get 
into film making, especially when commercials have proven to be a launching pad 
for such film directors as Ridley Scott ("Alien") and Adrian Lyne ("Fatal 
Attraction")? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Scripts 
</P>
<P>
Pytka says he was holding out for the right project. "I had read hundreds of 
scripts before agreeing to do this one," Pytka said in a booming voice that 
would fill an empty concert hall. "It's been a cat-and-mouse game. The studios 
say, 'We like your commercials and we like your visual style,' but they don't 
like to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be offered, as a first-time director, a really good piece of 
material," Pytka said. "The scripts that I got were dog-eared. Everybody had 
passed on them." 
</P>
<P>
Pytka says he was instantly attracted to the whirlwind story line and 
collection of interesting characters in Ernest Morton's script for "Let It 
Ride." But what really hooked him was Dreyfuss, who came attached to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Pytka passed on the script for "Stakeout" because he thought it 
was a routine cop-buddy story. Later, when Dreyfuss was cast in the lead role, 
Pytka was impressed with the actor's ability to transform the conventional 
script into a funny, successful film. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw the Market 
</P>
<P>
Pytka's inspiration to direct a film came in 1969, when "Easy Rider" became a 
hit. As a documentary producer from Pittsburgh who had just started shooting 
commercials, Pytka instantly recognized the market "Easy Rider" created for 
low-budget, independent films. Over his career, Pytka would write "about 10" 
unproduced screenplays but could never get any of his films into production. 
Meanwhile, his reputation as a commercial director soared. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing in the world that I can see is getting a film made," Pytka 
said. "It's scary. I always wanted to do a film with my own script. I never 
wanted an agent. I was never interested in the social aspects and the politics 
of getting into the business. And I never understood the studio system. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Let It Ride' is something I never dreamed I would do. I'm not against studio 
films, but all of the films that I've wanted to do have been my own quirky, 
personal little films -- in the tradition of commercial directors transitioning 
into film. You start with a low-budget film, kind of nurture it along. Then, if 
it becomes successful, they let you do something else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extended Play 
</P>
<P>
In structure, "Let It Ride" resembles an extended one-act play. Its 
thoroughbred pacing follows the rhythms of a race track, which Pytka says is by 
design. 
</P>
<P>
"People put too many conditions on films today," he said. "One of the problems 
with most of the screenplays I read, they were almost all written in the same 
style. It's like everybody read the same book, or went to the same school on 
how to write a screenplay. Each act must end at a certain point -- Act I, Act 
II, Act III. But this movie is like zzzzzip, from start to finish." 
</P>
<P>
The film's ensemble includes Teri Garr, David Johansen, Allen Garfield, 
Jennifer Tilly, Michelle Phillips, Mary Woronov and Robbie Coltrane. Pytka 
often had three cameras rolling to capture the spontaneity on the set. He was 
intent not to impose his distinct, close-up, fast-cutting commercial style on 
the actors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visual Stimulation 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of commercial directors today are over-stimulated visually," Pytka said. 
"In a commercial you overload a frame, and it's necessary because a commercial 
is so short. But you can't do that in films. You wear out the audience. They 
don't know what to look at. 
</P>
<P>
Pytka is working with an unnamed studio to get one of his own scripts, a love 
story, into production soon. But for now, Pytka is awaiting the outcome of "Let 
It Ride," which could help ease the way for his future projects. He is 
confident that the film will be successful if people only "get the point."

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: NEW FILMS FROM ABROAD AT MELNITZ THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Cutting Edge II," the International Film Circuit's second collection of 
new films from Europe, Asia and the Soviet Union, begins tonight at 8 in UCLA's 
Melnitz Theater with Taiwanese film maker Hou Hsiao-hsien's superb "Dust in the 
Wind" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Austere yet beautiful, detached yet compassionate, it tells a classically 
simple story of two rural young people who are in love and who seek a better 
life in Taipei. Not surprisingly, the struggle for survival is harder than they 
anticipated; in fact, nothing is really surprising in the entire film, yet 
thanks to the director's masterly talents it is deeply compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Hou's discretion is palpable, manifested in his middle-distance, 
deep-focus shots; it's as if he did not wish to intrude upon his vulnerable 
couple. At the same time Hou's vision is unwavering, and we come away with both 
a sense of timelessness and a sense of immediacy, of how the unskilled or 
semiskilled are losing out in an increasingly technological society. Wang 
Chien-wen is the young man, Hsin Shu-feng is the young woman, and they are 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Another UCLA Film and Television Archive presentation, "Marin Karmitz and MK2," 
continues Saturday at 8 p.m. in Melnitz Theater with two films that Karmitz 
produced and Claude Chabrol directed. Karmitz has been credited with reviving 
the career of the new-wave pioneer, who directed four hits in a row for 
Karmitz's MK2 Productions. Perversely, none of the four has yet been released 
in America, although the most recent and most dazzling, "A Matter Between 
Women," starring Isabelle Huppert as a small-town abortionist during World War 
II, was shown at the 1988 AFI FilmFest. 
</P>
<P>
"Poulet au Vinaigre" ("Chicken in Vinegar," 1985) and "Masks" (1986) are, 
however, vintage Chabrol, expressing his mordant, witty view of the more lethal 
aspects of human nature. "Poulet," which Chabrol wrote with Dominique Roulet, 
proceeds with delicious unpredictability. At first, it seems to be a 
David-and-Goliath tale: A small-town widow (Stephane Audran), confined to a 
wheelchair, battles to hold on to her old house against the local attorney 
(Michel Bouquet), physician (Jean Topart) and butcher (Jean-Claude Bouillaud), 
who are intent on developing her property. 
</P>
<P>
Murder, however, strikes from out of left field. What's more, far from being 
sympathetic, the widow, played with great elan by Audran, is a crazed harridan 
intent on ruining the life of her young son (Lucas Belvaux), a postman. This 
youth is the film's key character, the person who must get free not only of his 
mother but from the bourgeois hypocrisy of the men so eager to grab his 
mother's property. Also involved are Caroline Cellier as milquetoastish 
Bouquet's glamorous wife and Jean Poiret, who plays a shrewd, tough cop. (So 
successful was this film that Chabrol brought back Poiret as the star of his 
next picture for Karmitz, "Inspector Lavardin.") 
</P>
<P>
If "Poulet au Vinaigre," as enjoyable as it is, is occasionally wearying in its 
thicket of plot twists, "Masks" proceeds with unflagging zest. A startlingly 
thin, vigorous Philippe Noiret stars as the unctuous TV host of an amateur 
geriatric talent show. When he invites a would-be biographer (Robin Renucci) to 
his grand country estate, it soon becomes clear that the film is an homage to 
Hitchcock's "Notorious," with Noiret the equivalent of Claude Rains and with 
Renucci and Anne Brocher (as the TV host's goddaughter) in the Cary 
Grant-Ingrid Bergman roles. (We even hear Hitchcock's TV series theme -- 
twice.) Even so, "Masks" is very much Chabrol's film, charged with his 
preoccupation with bourgeois mores and marked with considerable stylistic 
flourish. "Masks" is as amusing as it is sinister. 
</P>
<P>
The Karmitz Sunday offerings are Romain Goupil's 1981 documentary "Half a 
Life," which screens at 8 and was unavailable for preview, and Ken Loach's 1981 
"Looks and Smiles," a poignant drama revealing the bleak future of British 
youth, written by Barry Hines and shown at Filmex '82. Information: (213) 
206-8013, 206-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
The 1927 silent, "Hotel Imperial," starring Pola Negri will be screened at 
Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills on Sundayat 7:45 p.m. For information, (818) 
888-3770.

BUCKLEY IN PHILHARMONIC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after the introduction of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's music 
director-elect may not have been a good time to make a debut with the 
orchestra. Not only was the occasion thoroughly upstaged, but the orchestra 
gave Richard Buckley rather unsettled performances Tuesday evening at Hollywood 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a different soloist than originally scheduled. Leon Bates 
replaced Ken Noda, who acquired "an indisposition" a week ago, in Beethoven's 
Second Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Given the exigencies of the Bowl rehearsal schedule, the substitution should 
not have caused artistic problems, but Bates seemed to have quicker ideas about 
the piece than Buckley. At some points, Bates' tempos seemed faster than he 
could handle articulately. Otherwise, he spun out a bright, focused and often 
sparkling account. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley apparently wanted a more mellow, plumper sort of interpretation. He led 
a down-sized orchestra in a genial, balanced accompaniment, responsive to 
Bates' goading on the tempo issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening, Mozart's Overture to "Don Giovanni," Buckley tried for 
transparency and tension. He got a scrambled, scrappy reading, in which speed 
and an almost frenzied sort of energy were the prime components. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Buckley and the full orchestra turned to Mahler's First 
Symphony. The conductor, who turns 36 on Sept. 1, accepted Mahler's judgment in 
dispensing with the "Blumine" movement and offered a formally clear view of the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
As realized in sound, though, his approach proved superficial. The Philharmonic 
played with greater cohesion than before, producing a measure of bucolic charm 
in the second movement. But the fierce contrasts and struggles of the work were 
so lightly tackled, that the various recapitulations on the road to triumph in 
the finale sounded like pro forma redundancies.

AWAKENING MACARTHUR PARK'S 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something is afoot in MacArthur Park this lazy August afternoon -- and it's got 
nothing to do with drugs or gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"One . . . two," a doe-eyed young woman commands from the band-shell stage, as 
a retinue of aspiring ballerinas in tutus jete to boom-box Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Three boys skid their bikes to a standstill, leaning forward on the handlebars 
to watch. Nearby, rows of wooden benches fill with sundry onlookers. A homeless 
man perched on a nearby hill is transfixed; the businessmen at the picnic table 
stop talking to eye the action. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the women through their paces is Helena Ross, veteran of international 
ballet competitions and best known to local balletomanes for her guest 
appearances with the Long Beach Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Her dancers are preparing an excerpt from "Sleeping Beauty" to be performed on 
Saturday as part of festivities designed as a show of strength by those who 
want to reclaim MacArthur Park for the community. 
</P>
<P>
Local girls and boys who are taking these free classes with Ross will 
participate in the parades and performance; a few of the boys will portray the 
evil Carabosse and his cohorts in the "Sleeping Beauty" selection. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by a coalition of community groups known as L.A. C.R.U.S.A.D.E.R.S., 
the parades will begin around 10:30 a.m. at Belmont High School and St. Basil's 
Catholic Church and converge upon the MacArthur Park band shell around 
lunchtime for the dances and other presentations. 
</P>
<P>
This event will be the second outing for Ross' Southern California Ballet of 
the Sun, a descendant of legendary Ballet Russe "baby ballerina" Tatiana 
Riabouchinska-Lichine's defunct Southern California companies. The group brings 
together professional dancers and inner-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
The first production of Ross' company was a fuller version of "Sleeping Beauty" 
at El Centro Wilshire Family Center in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
What's a nice classical dancer like Ross doing in an inner-city park like this 
-- working for free, no less? 
</P>
<P>
Giving something back to the community, as she sees it. Ross, who first took 
lessons at 4 in Shatto Park, studied on scholarship at the Lichine Ballet 
Academy and taught on the Westside before circling back to this part of town, 
where she once again lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I stumbled upon teaching in the inner city," Ross says, recalling her 
experience with former El Centro Wishire director Carmelo Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
"They were working on a little performance (at El Centro)," she says. "I guess 
I was too young and naive, but I said, 'Don't give up.' We had a crash course 
in 'Nutcracker' and the boys did their break-dancing. We did so much with those 
kids in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
It is, as she'll tell you, a far cry from the usual barre scene. "In Beverly 
Hills there was much more of a sense that I was baby-sitting," Ross says. "Here 
the family comes with the girls. They value the classes a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
"The community people are so pleased to see it happening," says Maria Ross, 
Helena's mother and company administrator. "There is nothing that would prevent 
these children from being as good as products of the Bolshoi or the Royal 
Ballet -- except funding." 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers are here, but somebody has to care." 
</P>
<P>
Alma Martinez, who sits beaming as her daughter runs and leaps on stage with a 
line of little girls, agrees. She calls Helena Ross a "special" teacher, adding 
that she hopes the classes will continue. 
</P>
<P>
So far Ross, who says she was a little nervous when she first brought her 
dancers to the band shell, hasn't had any problems in this unusual setting. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the so-called hoodlums appreciate culture," she says. "We joke about it, 
but there is a common bond. When we're up on that stage, they treat us 
differently, with so much respect." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing holding them back, Maria Ross says, is the lack of financing. 
"We got a grant from cultural affairs to do the show on the 19th, but that's 
it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Why aren't they putting money into recreational or cultural programming for 
the kids in the most densely populated part of the city?" she asks. "All there 
is is a senior program. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those gang members are fantastic soccer players and dancers and they 
sure as heck weren't getting into trouble when they were out there playing," 
she says, arguing that Los Angeles "might have less trouble with gangs later 
on" if such alternatives were supported. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Ross thinks so too: "The kids whose lives are shaken up need a program 
that won't be here one month and gone the next." 
</P>
<P>
"We should have a training system like they have at the Kirov, where you don't 
have to be rich to be talented. There's so much talent that's going to waste 
here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the odds these kids have against them. But if there's one thing 
that L.A. could contribute, it'd be having a company where the faces you see on 
the stage aren't all the same, aren't all WASPs. That to me is beauty."

HOW LINNEY FOUND A PLAY IN HIS NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm not sure why I wanted to do it," said Romulus Linney about his novel 
"Heathen Valley" that he turned into a play. "Maybe it was just wondering if I 
could. As a novel, it's a sprawling historical story with many characters. But 
as I got into it, I found that underneath a great deal of what was the novel, 
there was a sort of play lurking." 
</P>
<P>
Linney, who wrote the novel 27 years ago, rewrote it as a play two years ago 
and directed the piece in its maiden stagings -- at the Philadelphia Festival 
for New Plays, Milwaukee Rep and New York's Theatre for the New City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in as good shape as I could get it," noted the writer on the phone from 
his home in New York. "And now it's on its own. On Friday, a new production of 
"Heathen Valley" opens at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Based on an actual 19th-Century incident in rural North Carolina (where 
Linney's father's family was from, and where he himself spent many of his 
growing-up years), the story centers on a community parish, founded by an 
Episcopalian bishop and run by a native-born "mountain man." When the bishop 
has a change of heart and joins the Catholic Church, the mission falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked myself, 'What would happen to these very basic Appalachian 
mountaineers if this mission was built up -- which they thought a great deal of 
and which did a great deal for them -- and then, for some reason, it was taken 
away?' For me, it was a story of regeneration betrayed. I don't know about 
other writers, but the first thing I have to find is a good story. And somehow 
it has to have something to do with me personally." 
</P>
<P>
Linney notes that the connection needn't be first-hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've written plays about historical figures, Frederick the Great and (Lord) 
Byron among them. But in both cases, in reading about these great lives, 
there's been something about them that's had great personal meaning. Then I 
have the authority -- or feel I have the authority -- to go ahead and write 
about such titanic figures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same with 'Heathen Valley.' Also, these people are kind of my 
ancestors. So I felt that I had some kinship and a great deal of admiration for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Linney, who squeezed in an Army stint between studies at Oberlin 
College and graduate directing/acting courses at Yale Drama School, divides his 
time between teaching duties at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia 
College. He is married to a college professor and is the father of two grown 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, creative writing can't be taught," he said. "But what you can do is 
create an atmosphere in class where somebody's work is presented and very 
candid, supportive things can be said: truthful yet helpful." 
</P>
<P>
The work is emotionally satisfying -- and physically manageable. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach (in Pennsylvania) one day a week; it's only 1 1/2 hours on the Amtrak. 
When I get there I have a three-hour seminar, then I see some students -- then 
I get on the train and come back. When you're an adjunct, you're not 
responsible for the running of the department. You're not on committees, you're 
not terribly involved in faculty life. I don't think I'd be able to write well 
if I were a full-time member of any department." 
</P>
<P>
Linney (who's received Rockefeller, Guggenheim and National Endowment for the 
Arts grants, plus an Obie for "Tennessee" and an American Theatre Critics award 
for "Heathen Valley") counts music as his primary influence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up, I had no idea what I was going to do -- but I knew it 
would be something that music spoke about. My father was a doctor, a very fine, 
civilized man. We had a nice life, but there was no art connected to it. The 
thing that affected me most -- way back in the '30s -- was hearing concerts on 
the radio. Whatever it was, I responded to. I guess music being the most 
abstract of the arts, once you're moved by it you want to find out everything 
that has to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"So you start reading really good books instead of detective stories -- and it 
becomes a search. It's like when you first read Poe instead of having somebody 
tell you how wonderful it is. Then it becomes yours. Of course, when you first 
start writing, you do imitate. I wrote a little bit like Faulkner -- those 
huge, sprawling rhetorical things -- and a Swedish Nobel Prize-winner, Par 
Lagerkvist, who writes very fine, concise, crystalline prose. So it was kind of 
an odd crossbreeding."

ORANGE COUNTY PLANS FOR ARENA HURT BY L.A. OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH and MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Private developers offered Wednesday to replace the Los Angeles Sports Arena 
with a $100-million indoor arena for the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, 
a deal that casts a cloud over competing plans for similar facilities in Santa 
Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three financial backers of the proposed Los Angeles arena -- MCA 
Inc. and Spectacor Management Group -- also are involved in the financing of a 
proposed $85-million arena in Santa Ana. However, MCA Music Entertainment Group 
Chairman Irving Azoff said Wednesday that the Los Angeles deal would have no 
impact on arena plans for Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County and L.A. are two separate markets both very capable of 
supporting their own arena," Azoff said. "This just ends speculation about 
whether the Clippers will be moving their team to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling had flirted with the idea of moving to Orange 
County, and in May demanded that Sports Arena managers build a new facility as 
a condition of signing a long-term lease. But he had reiterated on several 
occasions that he preferred to keep his team in Los Angeles, and reacted to 
Wednesday's offer with immediate enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this offer is a victory for Los Angeles," Sterling said, adding that 
the Clippers will sign a 30-year lease if the new arena is built. 
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent assessments that an arena in Anaheim or Santa Ana 
could not be guaranteed financial viability without a National Basketball Assn. 
franchise, and the NBA is believed unlikely to approve a third franchise, 
besides the Lakers and Clippers, in the Los Angeles-Orange County metropolitan 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said Wednesday night, "I don't know, without a franchise, that there's 
much hope for an arena to be successful in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Azoff disagreed. Sterling's decision to stay in Los Angeles would not impede 
arena plans in Santa Ana, he said. "There are a lot of other NBA teams," Azoff 
said. But when asked whether there are negotiations under way to bring an NBA 
team to Santa Ana, he said, "I know of none." 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, Mayor Fred Hunter predicted that Wednesday's deal will spell the 
end of Santa Ana's arena plans. "It's not economically feasible to have (the 
same group) build one in Santa Ana and one in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said that Anaheim's plans to build an $85-million arena northeast of 
Anaheim Stadium will not be affected by the Clippers' staying in Los Angeles. 
"I don't want to speculate on what teams, but I really believe that we're going 
to get an existing team or an expansion team," he said. "The market is here in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a private management contract with the Los Angeles Coliseum may 
keep Spectacor from participating in the proposed Santa Ana arena. Joel Ralph, 
the general manager of the Coliseum and Sports Arena, said in a recent 
interview with The Times that the contract signed by Spectacor bars that 
company from participating in construction of any stadium within a 75-mile 
radius. MCA would not be barred from participating under its contract with the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Santa Fe Pacific Co., King-Guanci Realty Co. and Santa Ana were 
not available for comment Wednesday night on their plans to build a 20,000-seat 
arena on 17 acres at Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Los Angeles arena is contingent upon agreement by the Coliseum 
Commission to give the developers a long-term ground lease. In addition to MCA 
and Spectacor, the new arena would be financed by the Pritzker family, which 
owns the Hyatt Regency hotel chain. The facility would seat 21,500, with 200 
luxury suites and 2,000 club seats. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan was quick to give the offer his 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that I will definitely support and recommend to the full 
commission," Riordan said. "I'm very enthusiastic about this. It's the type of 
forward thinking we need to keep teams in the Coliseum complex." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said he will promptly appoint a committee of commissioners to study the 
economics of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said: "We're reviewing the proposed lease and expect to move forward 
after getting commission approval. The principals in this venture assure us 
they are putting up all the cash and they say the new arena can be completed in 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Clippers and USC would continue to play basketball in the 
present Sports Arena, a short distance from the proposed new facility. 
</P>
<P>
Participating in Wednesday's meeting besides Sterling were Ed Snider and 
Antonio Tavaras, Spectacor chairman and president, respectively, and Azoff. 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers are an integral part of Los Angeles," declared Snider, "and the 
new Sports Arena will provide them with a permanent home second to none. They 
are a first-class organization and they deserve a first-class facility. Our 
goal is to be ready for the 1991-1992 season." 
</P>
<P>
The new arena would also be used for rock concerts and other entertainment 
events, and plans call for it to include "the most comfortable seats and the 
most advanced technical lights, video and lighting systems in the nation," a 
joint statement issued by the Coliseum private managers and the Clippers 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of a new indoor arena and signing of the Clippers to a long-term 
lease would constitute the most dramatic success yet for the Coliseum's new 
private management arrangement. The same private managers are trying to 
negotiate a deal that would reconstruct the Coliseum in exchange for a new 
long-term lease keeping the Los Angeles Raiders football franchise in Los 
Angeles.

MCCOLL SETTLEMENT TALKS FAIL; CASE SENT BACK TO TRIAL JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Once-promising settlement talks over the city of Fullerton's potential 
responsibility for the McColl hazardous waste dump have broken down, raising 
the likelihood that the already-prolonged dispute will move toward trial. 
</P>
<P>
Two other groups of defendants -- developers and oil companies -- reportedly 
have already agreed to multimillion-dollar payments to settle their portion of 
the case, making Fullerton the sole remaining defendant. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen lawyers met this week in a last-ditch attempt to salvage an 
agreement in the last remaining portion of a second round of lawsuits involving 
the McColl dump. But the effort was thwarted primarily by a dispute -- not 
between Fullerton and the 700 homeowners near the site who are suing, but 
between the city and some of its insurers, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's financial responsibility is the last major question mark remaining 
in a dispute that is rooted in the World War II-era dumping of jet fuel waste 
at the McColl site in the western hills of the city, a site still awaiting 
cleanup four decades later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negligence Alleged 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits alleged that developers were negligent in building near the dump 
and that the city issued construction permits for the developments and failed 
to warn property buyers of the hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Among the legal issues still in contention are guarantees being sought by some 
of the city's insurers that they will be safeguarded from any future liability 
arising from the McColl controversy, guarantees that the city did not offer, 
sources close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
"We struck out," said Superior Court Judge Jerrold S. Oliver, who is overseeing 
the settlement talks. "First we had a settlement, then we didn't have a 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the turn of events, Oliver said he is sending the case back to 
its Superior Court trial judge, Tully H. Seymour. Seymour said Wednesday that 
he will now have to proceed toward trial with the remaining portion of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, who is retiring from the bench next month, said a "fruitless" meeting 
late Tuesday "was the last try at settling this thing as far as I'm concerned. 
. . . There's got to be some change in attitude among the parties if they're 
going to avoid a trial." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard G. Montevideo of Costa Mesa, representing Fullerton in the 
dispute, said this week's settlement talks "didn't go well, but there's still a 
chance. . . . It's always been a tough road to hoe in this case for the city." 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of the city remains the main hurdle in the resolution of 
what has become known in legal circles as "McColl II." 
</P>
<P>
An initial round of lawsuits resulted in total payments of about $14 million to 
more than a hundred homeowners around the McColl site by numerous defendants, 
including the city, the county, developers who put up housing tracts on three 
sides of the site, and oil companies believed to have contaminated the area in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
A second group of homeowners not involved in the first lawsuits filed suit in 
1986, also claiming that they should have been warned about the contaminated 
state of the dump and the health problems it could cause. Residents near the 
site in the past have complained of headaches, nausea and respiratory problems 
and, in some cases, a high rate of miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and oil companies have agreed in recent months to make cash payments 
to 701 residents in the second lawsuit. But exact terms of the agreements have 
remained sketchy because the pacts have been sealed under court order. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Manuel Hidalgo and Robert H. Sulknik, representing the residents, 
declined comment on the progress of the McColl II case. 
</P>
<P>
But Hidalgo, asked about the reported dispute between the city and its 
insurers, said: "That's something we (attorneys for the the residents) have no 
say in -- there's no fight over our end of the deal. . . . We're not the issue 
anymore, and it's a very sad state of affairs." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I sincerely do not believe that this case will not settle. We've 
come so close, it would be an economic waste." 
</P>
<P>
No future settlement talks have been scheduled.

MAN FACES HEARING IN VOTER FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man has pleaded not guilty to filing 21 fake voter 
registration forms during a Democratic Party drive last year. 
</P>
<P>
The forms were allegedly signed by Clifford Gordon Martens, 30, who was being 
paid $3 "bounty" for each new voter by the California Voters Registration Fund, 
an arm of the Assembly Democratic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Martens allegedly filed forms with either fictitious names or 
the names of non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
County Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney, who said an inquiry was started 
when similarities in signatures on registration cards were discovered last 
fall, described the case as the most significant involving voter-registration 
fraud in the county in the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tanney said, "as far as I know, there is no indication that illegal 
votes were cast because of this person's activities." 
</P>
<P>
Martens was arraigned last week on 42 felony counts involving the allegedly 
bogus registrations, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Friday in Santa 
Ana. Meanwhile, Martens remains in Orange County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail. 
Tanney said some of the allegedly bogus registrations occurred in the 72nd 
Assembly District, where Republican Curt Pringle's narrow victory over Democrat 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach last November is still being disputed. 
</P>
<P>
Local Democrats have asked a federal court to overturn Pringle's election, 
claiming that uniformed security guards posted at polling places in Latino 
communities by Pringle supporters intimidated potential Thierbach voters. 
Republicans contend that the guards were intended only to discourage voting by 
non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Republican officials said the alleged abuse shows that their fears of voter 
fraud on Election Day last November, particularly in the 72nd District, were 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
"We had strong suspicions that these activities were going on last spring and 
summer," said Greg Haskin, executive director of the Republican Party of Orange 
County. "It is a very serious situation because it points out how easily voter 
registration fraud can take place," Haskin said. "I personally believe that the 
fraud that took place is much greater than 21 voters." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Garza, executive director of the Orange County Democratic Party, said he 
was upset about the alleged incident but said it should not be over-dramatized. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-one cards out of over 12,000 registrations in the 72nd District is not 
a dirty trick," Garza said. "It doesn't constitute a massive amount of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're very upset it happened, but we regard this as an individual 
action," Garza said. The registration drive by the Democrats was a "very clean" 
operation, and the alleged abuses were an aberration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garza said both political parties pay a bounty to people who register voters. 
"We did it, the Republicans did it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martens was one of many canvassers hired by the California Voters Registration 
Fund during what Democrats said was one of their most successful, as more than 
300,000 voters were signed up across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Garza said Martens had been fired twice by the registration group, once for 
drinking on the job and the second time for trying to file false voter 
registration affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
Alison Harvey, an aide to Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), who chaired 
the Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee last year, said Wednesday that 
incidents like the alleged one in Orange County happen to both political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
"When we discover people faking registration cards, we fire them immediately 
and turn them into the authorities," Harvey said. It is not, she said, "a 
partisan issue."

SUPERVISORS IDENTIFY 4 POSSIBLE LANDFILL SITES; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DUMP WOULD TAKE NORTH COUNTY'S TRASH BY 1994; CURB-SIDE RECYCLING PLAN TO 
BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, faced with a growing trash-disposal problem, voted 
Wednesday to consider four of Orange County's eastern canyons as possible sites 
for a new landfill and to explore a curb-side recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the county's existing landfills are scheduled to reach capacity and 
close in the next six years, leaving North Orange County without a place to 
dump its trash by 1994 unless an alternative is found. 
</P>
<P>
The four canyons to be studied for a possible new landfill -- Gypsum, West 
Fremont, Blind and Olinda -- were selected from a list of 15 potential sites. 
The Olinda site in Brea would be an expansion of the existing landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose 3rd District includes all four sites, also 
proposed that the county consider policies that would reduce the amount of 
trash to be dumped. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reached the stage in this county where -- if we don't revamp the way 
we dispose of our trash -- we are going to be in the same situation as Los 
Angeles," Vasquez said. "The action to identify future alternative sites is not 
going to be sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
The alternatives to be studied include a curb-side recycling program in which 
residents would separate their glass, paper and cans before they are picked up. 
Another possible program would require trash haulers to separate the trash 
before it is sent to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
After the 90-day study, Vasquez said, the board will consider whether to 
implement the plan and whether it should be made mandatory, voluntary or tested 
as a pilot program. If implemented, the program would also be limited to the 
unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
A new landfill in Orange County could operate between 27 and 600 years, 
depending on the site selected. 
</P>
<P>
The County Environmental Management Agency has recommended that the Olinda 
landfill be expanded to operate for 30 more years, and that the county purchase 
another canyon as a long-term dump site. The supervisors will wait until an 
environmental impact report on the four sites is completed in about 10 months 
before deciding whether to follow that recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the proposal to convert a canyon to a landfill is drawing 
protests from environmentalists, city officials, and the Irvine Co., which owns 
most of the canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Meddick, president of the Rural Canyon Residents Assn., said the 
1,930-acre West Fremont Canyon bordering Cleveland National Forest would be the 
worst choice of the four proposed sites. Destroying the canyon would harm deer, 
the rare Tecate cypress tree and other wildlife, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Berkett, a wildlife biologist for the California Department of Fish and 
Game, also asked that West Fremont be dropped as a proposed landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
"Both forks of this canyon contain critical wildlife habitat," Berkett said. 
</P>
<P>
It would cost the county about $118 million to acquire West Fremont Canyon and 
build the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea City Council is adamantly opposed to the proposal to expand the Olinda 
landfill, which would cost the county about $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Brea community will be forced to endure these burdens for many more years 
to come" if supervisors approve the expansion, Mayor Gene A. Leyton said. The 
expansion would also delay by about 30 years a plan to convert the dump into a 
regional park. 
</P>
<P>
And the Irvine Co. sent a letter to the county complaining that "we have 
accommodated more than our share of landfill sites to meet the needs of the 
County of Orange, and we are opposed to the further study of any of the canyons 
on our property for new landfill purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Both Coyote Canyon and Santiago Canyon landfills are on property owned by the 
Irvine Co., which also owns West Fremont and Blind canyons, and most of Gypsum 
Canyon. Orange County owns Olinda Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Several supervisors expressed doubts about establishing a dump in Gypsum 
Canyon, which could contain 600 years' worth of garbage if a county jail is not 
built there. If a jail is built, the landfill could pose potential health 
problems for inmates and employees. Also, artesian wells in the lower reaches 
of the canyon are linked to ground water that could become polluted by trash, 
environmental studies show. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental study of the four sites will be conducted by the consulting 
firm of Michael Brandman Associates. A draft of the report should be available 
in February, with a decision by the Board of Supervisors likely in about a 
year, said Jerry Mitchell of the Environmental Management Agency.

BODY DISCOVERED BEHIND STORE IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police confirmed Wednesday that the partially clothed body found behind a small 
grocery store was that of a homeless man who lived in an open field next to the 
store's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbed body of Daniel Stewart Hammack, 45, was found Tuesday morning, 
lying underneath a tree in the parking lot of the Main Street Market at 2133 S. 
Main St., said police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Hammack's body was discovered at 6 a.m. by a friend, who had driven to the 
store looking for Hammack, Thomas said. The friend, who lives in his car, 
alerted police to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Hammack's pants and shoes were missing and a shirt was lying next to the 
blood-covered body when it was found yesterday, Thomas added. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said police have no suspects or motive. Police were initially uncertain 
about the victim's identity because Hammack carried no identification, Thomas 
said.

BIG WAVES LEAP OUT OF NOWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Impressive waves -- some as big as 10 feet -- thundered onto Orange County 
beaches Wednesday, in some cases catching swimmers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Two swimmers in Laguna Beach were taken to local hospitals with moderate neck 
and back injuries after sets of six-foot waves emerged from a seemingly calm 
sea and sent them plunging into the sand, lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
Waves as big as nine feet are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service warned people fishing or sightseeing near the surf 
today to be prepared for occasional, larger-than-usual waves washing over 
previously dry areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear that beach property will be threatened," the weather 
service added. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast was for diminishing surf beginning Friday as the effects of a 
South Pacific storm begin to wane. The storm, far out to sea and near the 
Equator, has been sending south-to-southeast swells against the Southern 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The swells have been causing the large waves at shore, but not a continuous 
parade of them. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is, we put out the yellow flag (indicating moderately dangerous 
surf), but it gets real calm for a while," said Laguna Beach lifeguard Kristi 
Farley. "It looks like a calm day, so people who don't know the beach think 
they can handle it. A lot of these people are tourists who haven't even seen 
surf before. 
</P>
<P>
"They go out and then a set (of big waves) comes in, and they get caught in the 
impact zone. They come right over the top of the wave -- we call it going over 
the 
</P>
<P>
falls -- and they slam into maybe two feet of water. It's like slamming into 
concrete." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest waves Wednesday -- an estimated 10 feet -- were reported at Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach State Park lifeguards reported rescuing at least 60 swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our second south swell of the summer, and it's the largest so far," 
said Dan Kennedy, a lifeguard supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente on Wednesday night was expecting its highest tide of the year -- 
7.1 feet -- which, coupled with the big surf, might threaten a lifeguard tower 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
"But our beaches themselves are in pretty good shape," said Richard Chew, the 
city's beach supervisor. "The south swells actually fill in the beach during 
the winter, so we're OK." 
</P>
<P>
Weather service forecasters expect Orange County beaches to receive the biggest 
waves today -- four to six feet with occasional nine-footers. They predicted 
waves of two to three feet in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and two to 
four feet, with a maximum five or six feet, in Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties.

MAYOR SEEKS REDUCTION OF COPTER NOISE; 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA COMPLAINTS SPUR CALL FOR MEETING WITH BASE OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to complaints from residents, Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry on 
Wednesday called for a meeting with commanders of Orange County military bases 
to press for reduction of noise generated by helicopters flying along the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Military helicopters have been spotted skimming beaches as low as 300 feet, a 
violation of guidelines calling for minimum height of 1,000 feet, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Daily flights cause windows to shake as helicopters hover along the coast en 
route to and from exercises at other bases or at sea, residents said. The 
low-altitude flights often disturb cliff-side homes, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopters are based at Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center and the 
Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps air stations. Duty officers at the bases 
declined immediate comment on the letter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Three Locations 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the noise from helicopters, which usually travel along 
the coastline every day, comes with the territory. The choppers -- 
single-engine UH-1 Hueys from Los Alamitos and CH-53 Sea Stallions from Tustin, 
and twin-engine CH-46 Sea Knights from both Tustin and El Toro -- use the route 
near the water to avoid traveling over heavily populated inland areas and to 
stay close to shore in an emergency, said Marine Lt. Col. Gary Albin, who helps 
to monitor noise complaints from residents. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just move aircraft someplace else without impacting someone else," 
Albin said. 
</P>
<P>
According to military regulations, twin-engine helicopters should be at least a 
mile off the beach if they are flying below 2,000 feet, weather permitting. The 
Hueys, normally close to shore, are directed to stay above 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Albin said Marine pilots occasionally fail to adhere to regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there's a problem sometimes, but the majority of our pilots are 
conscientious," he said. "Most pilots avoid beach areas." 
</P>
<P>
Residents called the El Toro base from throughout Orange and Riverside counties 
with about 500 complaints last year, Albin said. Each case is recorded, he 
said, and pilots are notified of the complaints. The base gets about 10 calls a 
month from Laguna Beach residents, he said, as helicopters make their way to 
and from Marine exercises at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered an Intrusion 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the helicopters have to go off routes to avoid oncoming traffic," 
Albin said. "This is when people get really incensed with aircraft. They feel 
it's an intrusion." 
</P>
<P>
Residents are studying up on helicopter types to learn more about the problem, 
said Grant Sullivan, a Laguna Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes too much sometimes. It just seems to go on and on and on," Sullivan 
said. "It's been so bad I couldn't talk on the telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's wife, Validia, said she has tracked military traffic since October. 
She is tired of the incessant "whop, whop, whop" of some helicopters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise is just horrendous," she said. "There have been constant daily and 
nightly flights that have been plowing through here." 
</P>
<P>
The noise is made worse, Sullivan said, by the echoes created by the hills near 
her house. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to The Times Orange County Edition, Emerald Bay resident J.A. 
Capobianco said: "Our weekend warriors seem to take extra delight in awakening 
us bright and early every Saturday and Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
But Col. Roger Goodrich, a former helicopter pilot with the California National 
Guard, which flies out of Los Alamitos, said the activity is necessary to train 
reserves in the event of war or disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't be there if national security didn't require it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Forsyth, a resident of Laguna near Victoria Beach, said activity on the 
weekends is particularly bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise was so intense and obtrusive that you couldn't carry on a 
conversation," he said Wednesday night. Forsyth put together a pamphlet to help 
residents identify helicopters, urging people to call base duty officers at the 
time of noisy flybys. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this can't continue," he said.

Airline passenger traffic in Orange County showed a slight increase of 1.9% 
last month over the same month a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger traffic count last month was 396,409, compared to 388,836 for 
July, 1988, according to figures just released by John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, takeoffs and landings, or total aircraft operations, dropped 
last month to 46,478, a 7.4% decline from the 50,189 recorded in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
General aviation activity -- or activity by private, non-commercial aircraft -- 
accounted for 84% of the total aircraft operations in July. That marks a 9.6% 
decrease from the comparable period 12 months ago.

PROBE OF COUNTERFEIT AIRCRAFT PARTS ENSNARLS MISSION VIEJO MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County consultant was charged with conspiracy, and officials at two 
Los Angeles area companies were implicated in a scheme that resulted in the 
placement of counterfeit parts in military and commercial planes, according to 
court documents filed Wednesday in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was outlined in federal court as Bruce J. Rice, president of Rice 
Aircraft Inc of Hauppauge, N.Y., pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and 
two counts of mail fraud in connection with the sale of the counterfeit parts. 
The firm pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Bruce Clark said no accident had been attributed to the 
parts, which were rivets and other fasteners sold between 1977 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
One way Rice Aircraft was able to sell its used parts was through an alleged 
kickback scheme, according to court records. The company paid kickbacks to 
employees of competitors in order to get advanced looks at their bids on 
important projects. It is alleged that Rice Aircraft would take that 
information and then underbid its rival firms, thereby winning significant 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Richard K. Ohlman, a Mission Viejo parts broker, was charged Wednesday with 
conspiring in 1982 with Rice and Rice Aircraft to pay kickbacks to employees of 
Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Hi-Shear Corp. in Torrance and Deutsch Fastener Corp. in Lakewood 
-- both parts manufacturers -- allegedly accepted kickbacks from Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Ohlman, 70, declined comment when contacted at his home Wednesday. If 
convicted, he faces up to five years in jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at Hi-Shear and Deutsch Fastener were not charged with a crime 
because they had agreed to cooperate as witnesses in the government's case 
against Rice, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the employees at Hi-Shear and Deutsch were acting on their own and 
not at the direction of management. Neither company has been accused of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides getting bid information, the employees allegedly supplied Rice Aircraft 
with test reports that were used to indicate that the counterfeit parts had met 
safety specifications even though they had not. 
</P>
<P>
Rice Aircraft's scheme worked this way, according to documents filed by the 
U.S. attorney's office: It took used or damaged nuts, bolts and rivets and had 
them stripped and replated. It then sold the parts as new under the original 
manufacturer's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"There were in excess of a thousand transactions detailed involving aerospace 
manufacturers and airlines throughout the Free World," Clark said. Federal 
officials said they have been unable to identify and retrieve all of the 
counterfeit parts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the airlines that purchased the used parts were United, American, Air 
France, TWA, Pan Am and Varig. They were used for everything from ensuring the 
integrity of the aircraft's structure to keeping panels inside the aircraft 
from coming loose. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rice, 42, faces up to five years in prison and has agreed to pay a 
$500,000 fine. The U.S. District Court in Seattle could impose an additional 
$250,000 fine and order restitution of up to $1 million. Rice Aircraft has 
agreed to pay a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The Rice case grew out of a tip from an anonymous whistle blower in his company 
and was investigated by a special federal task force called Northwest Defense 
Contracting. 
</P>

SMOTHERS BROTHERS STILL FIGHTING FOR LAUGHS

<P>
Dick and Tom Smothers have been carrying on the world's most famous brotherly 
quarrel since Cain and Abel locked horns lo those many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And although most of America is by now wise to the fact that the Smothers 
Brothers really don't hate each other, Dick Smothers says that he and his 
brother are actually getting the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get off a good show, Tommy and I look at each other and say, 'Well, 
fooled them again,' " Dick said recently. "If we had material, we'd be 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Yep, if the Brothers Smothers had material, they might actually make us laugh 
even harder than we have since they broke onto the nation's consciousness with 
a mid-season replacement variety show on CBS in 1967, one that knocked longtime 
Sunday night ratings champ "Bonanza" off its horse and made the Establishment 
reel. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in the 20 years since Tommy and Dickie were abruptly yanked from the 
airwaves after a dispute with the network over their decidedly liberal 
leanings, they've gotten remarkably conventional, acting in Broadway plays, 
making TV commercials and producing game shows, an indication that the 
Woodstock generation has indeed grown up. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the boys have become so mainstream that CBS, the network that 
originally spurned them, has welcomed them back -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
You see, the former "Tiffany Network" has seen the tarnish on the good silver 
that used to be its lofty ratings and has consequently given the Smothers 
Brothers a chance to come back with fresh episodes of their show after their 
20th anniversary show racked up boffo ratings two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to Dick, is that the network has jerked the show -- 
which originally introduced such talented future stars as Steve Martin, Chevy 
Chase, Pat Paulsen and David Steinberg -- in and out of time slots, never 
allowing it to build an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS doesn't promote us at all, despite the fact that we do two (Nielsen 
ratings) points ahead of anything else they put in our slots," Dick said. 
"They've got to know that promotions are crucial. But then, this is the network 
that canceled 'Green Acres' and 'The Beverly Hillbillies' while they were on 
top of the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the Brothers are contracted to CBS for eight episodes of an 
untitled sitcom, and if the network doesn't pick up the show, Dick said that 
they will sell it someplace else.

NEIL SIMON THINKS COMEDY IS BEST REFLECTION OF REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY BUCK, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playwright Neil Simon says tickling the funny bone is a better way to reflect 
reality than drama. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about what I'm trying to reflect of the human condition," said 
Simon, who will be honored on PBS's "American Masters" next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found that comedy is the best way for me to reflect my own feelings. I 
think comedy can be more realistic than drama. But I do like the mixture of 
comedy and drama in a play." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, the author of 25 plays, is perhaps the world's most successful 
playwright. Only one play, "Actors and Actresses," was scrubbed in tryouts 
before it reached Broadway. Many of them have been made into motion pictures, 
in addition to the stories he has written directly for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil Simon: Not Just for Laughs" examines his style of humor and offers a 
portrait of Simon through interviews with actors, directors and producers and a 
conversation with the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
The program includes excerpts from the film versions of such plays as "Barefoot 
in the Park," "The Odd Couple," "Plaza Suite," "Chapter Two" and "The Sunshine 
Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The cameras followed Simon for five or six months: to a tribute to the 
playwright at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel; to a comedy class he taught with his 
brother, writer Danny Simon; and to theaters where he put together his latest 
play, "Rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Many of his plays are inspired by aspects of his own life. Three plays, 
"Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway Bound," tell of an 
aspiring young playwright named Eugene Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
"Some plays deal with myself, some deal with friends of mine and some are just 
picked out of the air," he said. "My plays are never autobiographical; 
otherwise, I would call the characters Neil Simon. They're fictionalized 
experiences you remember. 
</P>
<P>
"Eugene Jerome is essentially Neil Simon. Essentially, yes. There is a 
catharsis in this. You don't go into it without purpose. I think the most 
cathartic one was 'Broadway Bound.' It dealt with my relationship with my 
family in a more traumatic period. 'Brighton Beach Memoirs' was a sort of 
idealized version of that family life." 
</P>
<P>
His current play on Broadway, "Rumors," is a farce and fast-paced comedy he 
wrote as a change of pace. Next up is "Jake's Women," which he said is a 
mixture of comedy and drama. He also has written two movies for Disney, "The 
Marrying Man" and "Heaven on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Simon is a graduate of Sid Caesar's 1950s television show, "Your Show of 
Shows," a phenomenal breeding ground for comedy that also produced such writers 
as Woody Allen, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks. Afterward, Simon 
also wrote for "Caesar's Hour." 
</P>
<P>
"I was so lucky to be able to work at that time with the best performers and 
the best comedy writers," he said. "That's what you go to college for, and I 
was getting paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success, or perhaps because of it, Simon has rarely been taken 
seriously by the critics. "I think, by and large, I've had my fair shake from 
the critics," he said. "You have to view it as a total. I think the very fact 
that they're doing a program about me indicates somebody is taking me 
seriously. When I say the critics are fair with me that includes the negative 
reviews because sometimes I agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
Simon moved to Los Angeles in 1975, and since that time all of his plays except 
"Broadway Bound" have opened on the West Coast before going to New York. He 
said West Coast audiences are more polite and generally arrive on time. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an apartment in New York and do move back and forth," he said, "but you 
reach a point in your life when you don't need the energy of New York to write. 
You take it with you in your head. I've never lost that sense of desire to 
write. If anything, out here it's increased." 
</P>
<P>
ODD SINGLE: Walter Matthau will star as a lawyer who defends a German 
prisoner-of-war accused of murder in a small U.S. town in the CBS World War II 
era movie "Incident at Lincoln Bluff." The movie, Matthau's first for 
television, will be telecast in February, 1990. Matthau has starred in more 
than 50 feature films and won an Oscar as best supporting actor in 1966 for 
"The Fortune Cookie."

A DIRECTOR'S 20-YEAR TREK TO THE BIG SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has been honored with every major directing award advertising has to offer. 
He has directed television commercials with Michael Jackson, Madonna, Michael 
J. Fox, Bo Jackson, Michael Jordan and E.T. His client list reads like a Who's 
Who of International Business, and includes Pepsi, Apple Computer, Nike, 
Perrier, Michelob and John Hancock Mutual Life. 
</P>
<P>
But it took almost 20 years and six aborted, self-financed film projects before 
the daring, controversial Joe Pytka, now 50, was able to accomplish his highest 
aspiration -- to direct a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Pytka's dramatic comedy, "Let It Ride," opens Friday. The film, starring 
Richard Dreyfuss, is about the wild and woolly winning streak of a compulsive, 
down-on-his-luck gambler at the horse races. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount is treating Pytka's big-screen debut like a dark horse by scheduling 
its press screenings on Friday. Screening a film the day it opens is a tactic 
normally reserved for critical disappointments, because it assures that a 
film's reviews will not appear until after its opening weekend. The last 
picture Paramount opened in that fashion was "Friday the 13th Part VIII." 
</P>
<P>
"We just finished the film and got the final print ready early last week," 
Pytka said in defense of the studio and his film. "We were geared up to open in 
September, then the studio moved it up a month to make it a summer film. So I 
believe they have high hopes for it. They're spending a lot of money 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Pytka is buoyed that the trailer for "Let It Ride" is getting laughs in 
theaters. Still, he admits that he is full of anxieties about how audiences and 
critics will respond to his work. The impatient Pytka is forced into playing a 
waiting game uncharacteristic to the advertising field. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful aura of stories that swirl about the director have become 
advertising folklore. One executive tells of the time Pytka challenged a 
creative director he was working with to a basketball game to decide a creative 
issue. The creative director reputedly walked away with a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off the Airwaves 
</P>
<P>
When shooting a $2-million Pepsi commercial at the Shrine Auditorium in Los 
Angeles, a pyrotechnical special effect accidentally set Michael Jackson's hair 
on fire. Pytka's two-minute Pepsi commercial featuring Madonna dancing and 
singing "Like a Prayer" inside a church was yanked off the airwaves last spring 
at the insistence of angry Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
In the conference room of his commercial-production company in Venice, Pytka, 
who stands an imposing 6-feet-4, calmly shakes off negative criticism. He says 
Madonna's commercial was one of the best things he's ever done, and expresses 
frustration with critics who "miss the point." 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody missed the point. Between 1986 and 1988, Pytka's commercial 
production company, which he runs with his brother, John Pytka, was named the 
best at the Cannes Film Festival. In those same years Joe Pytka also took home 
a carload of Clios, the advertising industry's equivalent of Oscars, for his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Considering his talent and notoriety, why has it taken Pytka so long to get 
into film making, especially when commercials have proven to be a launching pad 
for such film directors as Ridley Scott ("Alien") and Adrian Lyne ("Fatal 
Attraction")? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Scripts 
</P>
<P>
Pytka says he was holding out for the right project. "I had read hundreds of 
scripts before agreeing to do this one," Pytka said in a booming voice that 
would fill an empty concert hall. "It's been a cat-and-mouse game. The studios 
say, 'We like your commercials and we like your visual style,' but they don't 
like to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be offered, as a first-time director, a really good piece of 
material," Pytka said. "The scripts that I got were dog-eared. Everybody had 
passed on them." 
</P>
<P>
Pytka says he was instantly attracted to the whirlwind story line and 
collection of interesting characters in Ernest Morton's script for "Let It 
Ride." But what really hooked him was Dreyfuss, who came attached to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Pytka passed on the script for "Stakeout" because he thought it 
was a routine cop-buddy story. Later, when Dreyfuss was cast in the lead role, 
Pytka was impressed with the actor's ability to transform the conventional 
script into a funny, successful film. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw the Market 
</P>
<P>
Pytka's inspiration to direct a film came in 1969, when "Easy Rider" became a 
hit. As a documentary producer from Pittsburgh who had just started shooting 
commercials, Pytka instantly recognized the market "Easy Rider" created for 
low-budget, independent films. Over his career, Pytka would write "about 10" 
unproduced screenplays but could never get any of his films into production. 
Meanwhile, his reputation as a commercial director soared. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing in the world that I can see is getting a film made," Pytka 
said. "It's scary. I always wanted to do a film with my own script. I never 
wanted an agent. I was never interested in the social aspects and the politics 
of getting into the business. And I never understood the studio system. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Let It Ride' is something I never dreamed I would do. I'm not against studio 
films, but all of the films that I've wanted to do have been my own quirky, 
personal little films -- in the tradition of commercial directors transitioning 
into film. You start with a low-budget film, kind of nurture it along. Then, if 
it becomes successful, they let you do something else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extended Play 
</P>
<P>
In structure, "Let It Ride" resembles an extended one-act play. Its 
thoroughbred pacing follows the rhythms of a race track, which Pytka says is by 
design. 
</P>
<P>
"People put too many conditions on films today," he said. "One of the problems 
with most of the screenplays I read, they were almost all written in the same 
style. It's like everybody read the same book, or went to the same school on 
how to write a screenplay. Each act must end at a certain point -- Act I, Act 
II, Act III. But this movie is like zzzzzip, from start to finish." 
</P>
<P>
Pytka singled out the talent of the film's cast as the biggest difference 
between commercial and film production. The film's ensemble includes Teri Garr, 
David Johansen, Allen Garfield, Jennifer Tilly, Michelle Phillips, Mary Woronov 
and Robbie Coltrane. Pytka often had three cameras rolling to capture the 
spontaneity on the set. He was intent not to impose his distinct, close-up, 
fast-cutting commercial style on the actors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visual Stimulation 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of commercial directors today are over-stimulated visually," Pytka said. 
"In a commercial you overload a frame, and it's necessary because a commercial 
is so short. But you can't do that in films. You wear out the audience. They 
don't know what to look at. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Let It Ride' uses a very simple visual style. Where we had to be 
sophisticated visually, some of the horse-racing scenes, we did. But in the 
dramatic shots we let the people play. . . . (Francis) Coppola proved it in 
'The Godfather.' Let the camera sit and watch Marlon Brando, pal." 
</P>
<P>
Pytka is working with an unnamed studio to get one of his own scripts, a love 
story, into production soon. But for now, Pytka is awaiting the outcome of "Let 
It Ride," which could help ease the way for his future projects. He is 
confident that the film will be successful if people only "get the point."

LINNEY SCALED MOUNTAIN OF A NOVEL AND UNCOVERED THE PLAY 'HEATHEN VALLEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm not sure why I wanted to do it," said Romulus Linney about his novel 
"Heathen Valley" that he turned into a play. "Maybe it was just wondering if I 
could. As a novel, it's a sprawling historical story with many characters. But 
as I got into it, I found that underneath a great deal of what was the novel, 
there was a sort of play lurking." 
</P>
<P>
Linney, who wrote the novel 27 years ago, rewrote it as a play two years ago 
and directed the piece in its maiden stagings -- at the Philadelphia Festival 
for New Plays, Milwaukee Rep and New York's Theatre for the New City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in as good shape as I could get it," noted the Philadelphia-born writer 
on the phone from his home in New York. "And now it's on its own." On Friday, a 
new production of "Heathen Valley" opens at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Based on an actual 19th-Century incident in rural North Carolina (where the 
family of Linney's father was from and where he himself spent many of his 
growing-up years), the story centers on a community parish which doubled as a 
clinic and primitive school. It was founded by an Episcopalian bishop and run 
by a native-born "mountain man." When the bishop has a change of heart and 
joins the Catholic Church, the mission falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked myself, 'What would happen to these very basic Appalachian 
mountaineers if this mission was built up -- which they thought a great deal of 
and which did a great deal for them -- and then, for some reason, it was taken 
away?' For me, it was a story of regeneration betrayed. I don't know about 
other writers, but the first thing I have to find is a good story. And somehow, 
it has to have something to do with me personally." 
</P>
<P>
Linney notes that the connection needn't be firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've written plays about historical figures, Frederick the Great and (Lord) 
Byron among them. But in both cases, in reading about these great lives, 
there's been something about them that's had great personal meaning. Then I 
have the authority -- or feel I have the authority -- to go ahead and write 
about such Titanic figures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same with 'Heathen Valley.' Also, these people are kind of my 
ancestors. So I felt that I had some kinship and a great deal of admiration for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Linney, who squeezed in an Army stint between studies at Oberlin 
College in Ohio and graduate directing/acting courses at Yale Drama School, 
divides his time between teaching duties at the University of Pennsylvania and 
Columbia College. He is married to a college professor and has two grown 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, creative writing can't be taught," he said. "But what you can do is 
create an atmosphere in class where somebody's work is presented and very 
candid, supportive things can be said: truthful yet helpful." 
</P>
<P>
The work is emotionally satisfying -- and physically manageable. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach (in Pennsylvania) one day a week; it's only 1 1/2 hours on the Amtrak. 
When I get there I have a three-hour seminar, then I see some students -- then 
I get on the train and come back." 
</P>
<P>
Linney (who has received Rockefeller, Guggenheim and National Endowment for the 
Arts grants, plus a 1980 Obie for his play "Tennessee" and a 1987 American 
Theatre Critics award for "Heathen Valley") counts music as his main influence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up, I had no idea what I was going to do -- but I knew it 
would be something that music spoke about. My father was a doctor, a very fine, 
civilized man. We had a nice life, but there was no art connected to it. The 
thing that affected me most -- way back in the '30s -- was hearing concerts on 
the radio. Whatever it was, I responded to. I guess music being the most 
abstract of the arts, once you're moved by it, you want to find out everything 
that has to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"So you start reading really good books instead of detective stories -- and it 
becomes a search. It's like when you first read Poe instead of having somebody 
tell you how wonderful it is. Then it becomes yours. Of course, when you first 
start writing, you do imitate. I wrote a little bit like Faulkner -- those 
huge, sprawling rhetorical things -- and a Swedish Nobel Prize-winner, Par 
Lagerkvist, who writes very fine, concise, crystalline prose. So it was kind of 
an odd crossbreeding." 
</P>
<P>
 "Heathen Valley" by Romulus Linney will be staged at the Gem Theatre, 12852 
Main St., Garden Grove. Preview performance tonight at 8. Tickets: $10. The 
regular run opens Friday and continues through Sept. 16 at 8 p.m. Wednesdays 
through Saturdays; 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 27 and Sept. 3, 3 p.m. matinees Sunday and 
Sept. 10. Tickets: $16 to $20. Information: (714) 636-7213.

SYMPHONY DONORS MEET KORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It was a perfect showcase for what the maestro called "such a beautiful 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
Through the living room picture window, from the tables on the terrace, all the 
elements were in place: cloudless blue sky, neatly appointed homes, an 
occasional pleasure boat cruising the glinting bay. 
</P>
<P>
For the 50 guests at Irene Bentley's Lido Island home on Sunday, the sights 
might not have seemed all that spectacular -- these were, after all, the 
Pacific Symphony's key donors, people with bay-front or other postcard views 
from their own living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
They came by invitation only to Bentley's cocktail party to meet maestro 
Kazimierz Kord, music director of the Warsaw Philharmonic, who will be the 
Pacific Symphony's principal guest conductor and music adviser this season. 
Kord had come from his summer home in Baden-Baden, West Germany, and as he said 
in a brief talk to the enthralled patrons: "For me, it is now approximately 4 
o'clock in the morning, and I can't talk well what I should talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. It was enough that he was there -- charming, slightly exotic 
looking, amenable to the steady flow of introductions and posed pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very used to the American system," said Louis Spisto, the orchestra's 
executive director. Meaning? "This," he said, nodding in the direction of Kord, 
who was just then being led by the elbow to pose for a picture by Bentley's 
grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
For a couple of hours before dusk, the small crowd eddied around Kord, who, in 
his jet-lagged, broken-English way, could not have been more gracious nor 
looked more the part of maestro: shoulder-length salt-and-pepper hair, black 
shirt and slacks, an enormous, opal-studded Orthodox cross dangling over his 
heart. Of his unusual necklace, Kord said: "For me, it is a talisman I like." 
Just that, and a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Jeanette and Harold Segerstrom, who came with daughter Sandra 
and son-in-law John Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
John Daniels, who has conducted college and high school orchestras, said he had 
tried to talk Kord into holding an open rehearsal. "At a concert, what you're 
seeing on the podium -- from a conductor's point of view -- is just the tip of 
the iceberg," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kord had declined to open his rehearsals to observers, "I'm still 
going to try to wheedle my way in," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Rappaport had a laugh with Kord "about the last time we talked," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport, who attended the party with her husband, Irving, said she first met 
the maestro in Warsaw two years ago, when Irving was attending a medical 
convention. Now that Kord was in California, the Rappaports were headed back to 
Poland for another medical convention. 
</P>
<P>
Bogumila Laskowska and Jadwiga Ginther -- sisters who grew up near Krakow and 
now live in Laguna Hills -- said they remembered hearing about Kord during 
their childhood. "He was a famous young conductor," Laskowska said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle and Florence Van Patten watched pelicans from a table on the terrace and 
recalled Kord's guest appearance with the orchestra last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought his conducting made the orchestra seem like it was more alive," Lyle 
said. "It just seemed like they were more dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the party were George and Anne Schopick, Gerry and Christa Long, 
Floss and Ed Schumacher, Carol and George Ditzler, Margaret Mustoe and Elaine 
Redfield.

ANN CONWAY: STARS TWINKLED ON MAN OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So many superstars, so little time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tall cotton, isn't it?" said John Crean on Saturday night, ogling the 
galaxy of luminaries crammed into the ballroom of the Century Plaza Hotel in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On view at the bash, which raised more than $1 million for St. Jude Children's 
Research Hospital in Memphis: Danny Thomas, Bob Hope, George Burns, Milton 
Berle, Steve Allen, Buddy Ebsen, Red Buttons, Carol Channing, Bea Arthur, Cyd 
Charisse, Tony Martin, Virginia Mayo, Cesar Romero and more. So many more. 
</P>
<P>
But -- are you ready for this? -- the stars were there to ogle Crean, the 
second Orange County resident in as many years to receive the St. Jude Man of 
the Year Award from Danny Thomas, who founded the hospital in 1962. (Car dealer 
Roger Miller received the prestigious nod last year.) 
</P>
<P>
Crean's coup had its beginnings in 1981, the year he and his wife, Donna, 
became aware of the hospital and began to support it. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year, Crean, who lives in Newport Beach, was invited by L.A. Rams 
owner Georgia Frontiere to watch a football game in her Jacuzzi-appointed suite 
at Anaheim Stadium. Danny Thomas, a buddy of Frontiere's, was also there. 
"Danny came up to me and asked me if I wanted to be St. Jude's Man of the 
Year," Crean said. "And I told him I certainly did. So here we are!" 
</P>
<P>
The award has a hefty price tag -- a $100,000 donation to the hospital. "John 
sent me his check one week after I asked him," said Thomas, beaming a megawatt 
smile at Crean during the star-studded VIP pre-event party (where George Burns 
sat in a corner smiling impishly at guests while he puffed a cigar). "Do you 
know how many people do that? Few. The money has been collecting interest for 
the hospital ever since. Crean is a wonderful guy." 
</P>
<P>
Among guests who came from Orange County to the affair (some of them in luxury 
motor coaches provided by the Creans) -- former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, home 
from his whirlwind tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first walk on 
the moon. "John is a very kind man, generous with those of all statures," 
Aldrin said. "He is most helpful to those in need." 
</P>
<P>
After settling down to a feast that included Chateaubriand and chocolate 
squares crammed with whipped cream and fresh berries, Bob Hope welcomed guests. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can't get your attention, no one can," said Danny Thomas' daughter, 
Terre, who followed Hope to the podium. (Indeed. One of the most dreaded 
challenges for gala hosts is hushing guests.) 
</P>
<P>
Tony Thomas, the comedian's son, did the presenting honors. He said of Crean: 
"His company, Fleetwood Enterprises, a Fortune 500 company, employs 10,000 
people in 17 states and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
"I accept this honor gratefully," said Crean as 1,700 guests listened in 
silence. "It is wonderful the way Rose Marie (Thomas) and Danny Thomas inspire 
others to keep their special dream alive." 
</P>
<P>
Show time. Milton Berle, Steve Allen and Danny Thomas came on stage to crack 
guests up with a show dubbed "The Living Legends of Comedy." (Sid Caesar was 
supposed to have performed, but got hung up in New York. Allen volunteered to 
replace him.) 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the madness that had guests rolling in the aisles: 
</P>
<P>
Berle to Allen: "I love your suit. You never throw anything away, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
Allen to Berle: "If I did, you'd put it in your act." 
</P>
<P>
Berle to audience: "This hotel opened in 1967 with my act!" 
</P>
<P>
Allen to Berle: "Who was doing it at the time?" 
</P>
<P>
Thomas to audience: "They say I'm religious. Bob Hope once said I was so 
religious that the California Highway Patrol stopped me for having stained 
glass windows in my car." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: Jolene and Tom Fuentes, Pilar Wayne (in scarlet silk and a 
twinkling tiara), Buck and Colleen Johns (who are busy-busy cleaning their 
Santa Ana Heights house to prepare for Vice President Dan Quayle's visit there 
Aug. 24), Carl and Margaret Karcher, Barbara and Alexander Bowie, Mardy and Art 
Svendsen, Virginia and Paul Bender, Marion and Tony Montupert, Arvella and the 
Rev. Robert Schuller, Lois and Ted Lundberg, and Vikki Vargas and Mike Nason.

LIFE ON WHEELS: SOME LOOK FOR GAS PRICES, JUST IN THE KNICK OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My gas tank may be nearly empty, as usual, but at least my mailbox is full. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County drivers still have plenty to say on several subjects that we've 
discussed in this column recently, including fueling up: when, where and how we 
do it, and what can happen if we don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate spending time waiting in gas lines, so I drive until I'm almost on 
empty," writes Ping Gee of Anaheim, a woman after my own heart. Since she 
traded in her old car for a new -- and unfamiliar -- one a couple of months 
ago, she says: "I'm not too sure where 'empty' actually is. The manual says 15 
gallons, but the most I have put in is 14.08 gallons." (If that's true, Ms. 
Gee, then I would say that you run it down way below "almost empty.") 
</P>
<P>
"I use the trip odometer," Gee continues, "to gauge how far I actually drive 
between fill-ups, so fortunately I won't really run out of gas." (Hey, my 
philosophy is, if you've still got .92 of a gallon stashed away, you're good 
for a week.) 
</P>
<P>
Gee says she always pays cash, pumps her own gas and usually sticks to one 
brand because "they tend to have the cheapest name-brand gasoline." However, 
she has found price variations of several cents per gallon even within that 
same brand, so she tries to avoid the pricier ones, unless she's desperate. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband just rolls his eyes when I point out which gas station we should go 
to when we're out and about, but I figure, why should we pay up to 10 cents 
more per gallon of gas, when one of the cheaper stations is in the vicinity 
that we're headed to? Of course, he always points out that the most I'm going 
to save anyway is about 60 cents. Big deal! But 60 cents per fill-up is a big 
deal when I'm filling up once every 10 days. Since my work commute is only six 
miles, most people would save a lot more than I do, since they commute 
further." 
</P>
<P>
But Marilyn Vanderwarf of Garden Grove points out that not everyone has the 
choice of saving with self-serve. "It is impossible for me to use self-service 
due to rheumatoid arthritis. Prices per gallon of gas for full-service are much 
higher; the difference between full- and self-service is as much as 10 to 30 
cents per gallon. Consequently, the customer who cannot use self-service is 
penalized by the high cost of full-service. 
</P>
<P>
Good point. We make spaces for people with handicaps to park their cars, so why 
couldn't some gas stations offer assistance and/or a price break when they fill 
up? 
</P>
<P>
Several readers wrote about the times when they tried to keep going on nothing 
but fumes. Henry C. Meyer of Laguna Beach remembered the time that he and his 
friends, Howie and Stu, were on the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles, climbing 
up Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
"About a hundred feet from the crest . . . the big car began to buck and 
stutter. 'I forgot to get gas!' Howie exclaimed. Stu let out a long wail. 
'Howie,' I yelled, 'put her in neutral; maybe we can coast over the top.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's what he did and pulled over to the far right lane. Slower and slower 
the overpass approached. Would we make it? 50 . . . 45 . . . 40 . . . 35. We 
all hunched over forward, like cutting down the wind resistance. At 25, we 
groaned. Would we make it, already in the shadow of the overpass? 25 . . . 20 . 
. . 15. We were over!" 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there was a gas station at the bottom of the hill, and they 
coasted -- "neat as you please" -- right up to the pump. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring my lecture on seat belts, Jeff Draugelis of Newport Beach wrote 
to say that he's a true believer in buckling up. Draugelis says that he 
believes that "driving with seat belts can make one a better driver. Not to 
insist that there is an absence of a threat of harm, but to declare a 
different, assured attitude toward the art of driving. I feel more confident 
and certain of my actions and reactions." 
</P>
<P>
Draugelis says he comes from a family of bucklers. "I do believe it is a 
genuine example of both intelligence and concern for one's self and for others 
with whom one shares the highways." 
</P>
<P>
He says he began to appreciate seat belts about 10 years ago when he delivered 
cars all over Southern California for a leasing company. Buckling up, he says, 
gave him a "relaxed assuredness" whether he was behind the wheel of a Fiesta or 
a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
"I have owned three automobiles. . . . I tend to keep them quite a while and 
maintain them well. Just as each car was unique in its road manners, each had a 
different type of seat-belt system," Draugelis says. His first, a 1970 Cutlass 
Supreme, had a three-point, two-strap setup. "I really liked this one. A driver 
truly got the impression he was buckling up for a 'race' for sheer survival. 
Though the belts hampered freedom of normal movement, they made up for that 
deficiency by making their presence absolutely known." 
</P>
<P>
His two other cars have had passive restraint systems, which Draugelis prefers. 
"I have yet to drive a vehicle with the new, motorized belts that 'entrap' you 
-- not my terminology or sentiment. But I'm looking forward to such an 
encounter." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's San Juan Capistrano station passed 
along some new seat-belt statistics. In case the other arguments for seat belts 
haven't swayed you, here is one that might: CHP officers wrote 616,701 
citations in 1988 -- more than 50,000 a month -- for violations of the 
seat-belt law. (The fine is $20 for the first offense, $50 for a subsequent 
offense -- plus court costs and assessments, which can be several times the 
amount of the fine itself, depending on the court and the judge.) 
</P>

Looking Like New 
</P>
<P>
Do you wash your car often? Or do you wait until the kids can write graffiti in 
the dust? We would like to know about your car-cleaning habits, inside and out. 
Do you wash it yourself? What kind of cleaner works best? Do you insist on a 
chamois or will paper towels and rags do just as well? Maybe you go to a 
carwash. Or do you prefer having your car detailed?

<TEXT>
<P>
President Wojciech Jaruzelski agreed today to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's 
plan for a coalition government of Solidarity and two minor political parties 
that would make Poland the first Soviet Bloc nation not led by Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish president also agreed to accept a Solidarity member as premier, a 
lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, the Solidarity leader, has stressed that a coalition government would 
offer the ministries of defense and interior, which control the army and 
internal police, to the Communist Party. This perhaps would ease Soviet fears 
about a fissure in the Warsaw Pact military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak, who recently said he would leave office 
because he could not form a government in the face of the Solidarity-led 
opposition, turned in his resignation today. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity lawmaker Jacek Kuron, summing up a historic two-hour meeting between 
Jaruzelski and leaders of a Walesa's newly forged Parliament coalition, said 
the coalition proposed to Jaruzelski three candidates for premier, none of them 
Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In the Nearest Future' 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski "said he will grant nomination to one of the Solidarity candidates 
in the nearest future," Kuron told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates are Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek; 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, editor of the labor movement's weekly newspaper, and Kuron, 
an activist in the Polish opposition for more than 20 years who has spent nine 
years in prison for anti-government activities. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary sources said Jaruzelski's choice would be Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
"The president accepted the proposition of Walesa" to form a coalition 
government, said Jerzy Jozwiak, head of the Democratic Party, one of the two 
parties that recently aligned themselves with Solidarity. He commented after 
attending the meeting at which the opposition plan was presented to Jaruzelski. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, poised to grant enormous control over Poland's destiny to the 
Solidarity labor movement he crushed eight years ago, will issue a formal 
statement Friday, Jozwiak said. 
</P>
<P>
An official communique issued today said Jaruzelski "declared that he will 
urgently consider the presented propositions and conduct appropriate 
consultations aimed at the quickest possible appointment of such a government 
in the interest of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
The communique did not say who would lead the government, but Walesa has said 
the coalition should be based on an alliance of Solidarity, the United Peasant 
Party and the Democrats, with a Solidarity member as premier. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, mobbed by reporters as he returned to his hotel after the meeting, 
looked tired and pleased and said the outcome of the meeting was "good." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said the nomination of the premier is "the president's matter. . . . 
Let's respect the president. This matter is in his hands." Walesa said he was 
"satisfied with the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet press agency Tass, in a report on the Polish developments, said 
there is a "positive" chance that a Polish government will quickly be formed 
"in which the role of the motivating force would be played by Solidarity."

</P>
<P>
There were 11,507 tickets with four winning numbers, worth $57 each, and 
227,943 tickets with three correct numbers, each worth an automatic $5. 
</P>

VAN THIEF OUTRACES POLICE TO MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-speed chase from Santa Ana to Mexico ended early this morning when the 
driver of a reportedly stolen van eluded police and the California Highway 
Patrol and disappeared across the border. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began at 10:30 p.m. in Santa Ana when residents on West Walnut Street 
reported that a suspicious-looking van was being driven back and forth, police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Police responding to the call spotted the van, 
which had been reported stolen in Costa Mesa near the corner of Bristol Street 
and Civic Center Drive. The driver, ignoring orders to stop, began racing north 
along Bristol to the Garden Grove Freeway, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
From there, three Santa Ana police cars followed the van at speeds reaching 80 
m.p.h. to the Costa Mesa Freeway and then to the Riverside Freeway, calling the 
California Highway Patrol for help. Patrol cars then chased the van to 
Interstate 15 in Corona, where the fleeing driver turned south and headed 
toward Mexico, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended after midnight in San Ysidro, a small border town in San Diego 
County, after the van sped past border guards and into Mexico. Police have been 
unable to identify the suspect.

An Anaheim man, stopped in Laguna Hills for driving erratically early this 
morning, was wounded by gunfire after he allegedly tried to run down several 
California Highway Patrol officers, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Steve Malone, of the CHP's San Juan Capistrano station, said the incident 
began when officers tried to stop Mario Michael Wiggins, 29, near El Toro Road. 
Officers called for a backup unit when he sped off and chased him to a parking 
lot near a residential construction area, investigators said. There, Wiggins 
got out and "was acting very bizarre," said Lt. Richard J. Olson, of the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. "He apparently began waving his arms around and 
started shouting. Then he jumped back into his car." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins then sped forward, spun the car around and headed for the officers, 
according to their accounts. One of them leaped out of the way and sprained his 
ankle, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the officers fired their handguns, one of them hitting Wiggins once 
in the left arm, Olson said. Wiggins was taken to nearby Saddleback Community 
Hospital, but he resisted treatment, Olson said. He was then transferred to the 
jail ward of at Western Medical Center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said it did not appear that Wiggins was armed. Sheriff's deputies are 
seeking court approval to search Wiggins' impounded car for a weapon.

Soldiers loyal to China's president detained the defense minister and several 
commanders in a dispute over a top military post vacated by Zhao Ziyang, the 
purged Communist Party boss, Chinese sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
They said President Yang Shangkun, a central figure in the martial law 
crackdown, apparently ordered the action to strengthen his control of the 
Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
In the military power struggle, soldiers loyal to Yang went to the Beijing 
residence of Defense Minister Qin Jiwei about 6:40 p.m. Wednesday and took him 
and one of his armed guards away, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Other troopers detained the heads of the Beijing, Guangzhou and Nanjing 
military districts, who support Qin and who were in Beijing for an important 
meeting, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Control of the military is essential in high-level Chinese politics. Senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping's only official post is chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, China's top military body. 
</P>
<P>
Qin and Yang have been competing to become first vice chairman of the 
commission, left vacant by Zhao's dismissal June 24. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, government spokesman Yuan Mu confirmed reports that student leader 
Wang Dan had been arrested and said Zhao, who has not been seen in public since 
May 18, is leading a "completely normal life." 
</P>
<P>
A Shanghai newspaper said authorities have arrested or are investigating 99 
people accused of involvement in illegal workers' groups that plotted to 
establish a "people's party" and to kidnap officials. The Shanghai Liberation 
Daily said the groups planned to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the Guangming Daily, the Communist Party's leading newspaper 
for intellectuals, said senior editor Yao Xihua, 61, has been "asked to 
retire."

Neighbors led three young Lancaster boys to safety this morning after a candle 
being used for light because electricity had been turned off touched off a 
blaze in their apartment, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 12:15 a.m. in the two-bedroom apartment in the 45400 
block of Cedar Avenue, Capt. Rory Rehbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Donna Jean Halstead, 34, had lit a candle in her bedroom 
because the electrical power had been turned off, apparently for non-payment of 
a bill. Later, while she was outside talking with neighbors, the candle 
apparently fell over or burned down and ignited a fire, Rehbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Halstead's three sons, James, 11, Josiah, 7, and Phillip Aaron, 5, were 
sleeping in the second bedroom. When Halstead noticed flames coming from her 
bedroom, she screamed for help. Authorities said neighbors Chris Willis and 
Wesley White ran inside, grabbed the children out of bed and led them out of 
the apartment, which was filling with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries, and firefighters extinguished the blaze in 10 minutes. 
Damages were estimated at $20,000.

The government warned today that it will stamp out an unprecedented protest 
movement among France's gendarmes, the paramilitary police renowned for their 
stiff-backed devotion to duty. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the protests over poor conditions 
in the 91,000-member force have gone too far and are politically orchestrated. 
</P>
<P>
"Anonymous appeals are even inciting gendarmes, the guardians of legality, to 
take illegal action," Chevenement said in an open letter to all ranks. "This is 
not acceptable and will not be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
After years of grumbling in vain about low pay, long hours and the martial 
bleakness of barrack life, gendarmes spread the spirit of rebellion rapidly 
this week. In a cascade of anonymous letters to newspapers, gendarmes 
throughout France have risked dismissal by threatening to stage the first 
industrial action in the gendarmerie's centuries of history.

Gov. Gaston Caperton's estranged wife today sued him and five other parties for 
$12 million, alleging securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Caperton charged that she was forced to sell her stock in the Caperton 
family's insurance and investment business to her husband in 1988 for $2.98 
million, below fair market value, to shield him from political harm. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, also names state Sen. Lloyd Jackson, 
Caperton's top political adviser; Tom Graff, Caperton's legal adviser, and 
three Caperton-controlled companies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said Jackson told Dee Caperton while she was a member of the state 
House in 1986-88 that she was violating a law barring elected officials from 
profiting from state contracts. At the time, a Caperton-controlled company held 
a $3-million contract with the state Public Employees Insurance Board, which 
handled medical benefits for state employees. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Jackson told Dee Caperton that she was about to be 
indicted and that she "must act quickly to diminish the political damage to her 
husband and herself." Caperton at the time was a candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
No indictments were ever returned.

Soldiers today began turning back Palestinians headed to work in Israel for 
failing to have the government's new computerized identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian activists have called for a strike starting Friday to protest the 
identification cards, which Israeli officials say are needed to improve 
security. 
</P>
<P>
The system was announced several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has become primarily a test of strength between the army-run civil 
administration in the Gaza Strip and clandestine uprising leaders, who are 
trying to sever ties between Palestinians and Israel as part of their revolt 
against 22 years of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the military government in Gaza, told Israel 
radio today that 5,000 Gaza workers were allowed to enter Israel through the 
Erez Checkpoint between 3:30 a.m. and 7 a.m.

The Census Bureau, in a major experimental study released today, found large 
shifts in the poverty population over short periods of time, with as many as 
25% of those who are poor one year no longer in poverty the next. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted in 1984-85, shows considerable movement of people into as 
well as out of poverty. For example, one in five people with a poverty-level 
income in 1985 had not been poor in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The new study is expected to be closely studied by government officials and 
private researchers involved in welfare reform and social policy issues, and it 
provides some of the first official confirmation of some researchers' 
contention that many people experience poverty in spells or short episodes.

Exxon Corp. should be forced to pay billions of dollars to restore Alaskan 
areas fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, three environmental groups said 
today in announcing a lawsuit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was to be filed later in the day in Alaska Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
It seeks to force Exxon and the Alyeska pipeline company to finance the cleanup 
and restoration of the environment through an independently supervised trust 
fund after the March 24 tanker spill of about 11 million gallons of oil into 
Alaska's once-pristine Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the fund will amount to billions of dollars," said Sharon 
Newsome, vice president of the National Wildlife Federation. Other participants 
in the suit are the Wildlife Federation of Alaska and the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks punitive damages against the companies, alleging that they 
engaged in fraud and misrepresentation of their ability to react to a major oil 
spill. The damages would be paid into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon already faces 150 lawsuits, mainly by Alaskans whose livelihoods were 
impaired by the oil spill. In addition, the state of Alaska filed suit Tuesday 
seeking unspecified damages.

Donald Trump, former owner of the New Jersey Generals in the United States 
Football League, said he plans to become owner of a New York-area team in a 
proposed new baseball league. 
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed to become a part of it, to work with them and make this league a 
great success," Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday. Organizers of the 
proposed eight-team league hope to begin operations next April. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who also organized the Tour de Trump bicycle race and several 
championship boxing cards, is the first person to acknowledge that he will own 
a franchise. He said the team will play in northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a very viable league," Trump said. "We'll have a long-term 
contract with a major television network or a number of major networks, 
including cable." 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the league said other teams are expected in Washington, Los 
Angeles, Miami, Denver, Vancouver, Portland, Ore., and New Orleans or San Jose.

Charges stemming from an Aug. 6 altercation between Columbus Clippers 
outfielder Deion Sanders and two Richmond fans were dismissed today after 
Sanders agreed to make a donation to benefit handicapped fans here. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Ross and Chris S. Burke, fans of the Richmond Braves, swore out assault 
warrants against Sanders, who with his companion, Carolyn Chambers, obtained 
assault warrants against Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The altercation occurred after Sanders was lifted for a pinch hitter in the 
ninth inning of a Clippers-Braves game. He apparently went straight to the 
locker room, changed clothes and confronted Burke and Ross, who he believed had 
been harassing Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Yankees, the parent team of the Clippers, said they have fined 
Sanders and might take other action.

3 NO-HITTERS AREN'T ENOUGH TO GET PITCHER TOM DREES TO BIG LEAGUES

Vancouver pitcher Tom Drees has to wonder how to get to the major leagues. 
Apparently, pitching three no-hitters in one season doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Drees, 26, accomplished the feat as the Canadians downed the Las Vegas Stars 
5-0 Wednesday night in the first game of a double-header. In the minor leagues, 
double-header games are seven innings each. 
</P>
<P>
The performance, witnessed by Larry Himes, vice president and general manager 
of the parent Chicago White Sox, tied a mark set in 1952, when Bill Bell threw 
three no-hit games in the Class D Appalachian rookie league. 
</P>
<P>
Drees' first two no-hitters came in back-to-back starts. He blanked the Calgary 
Cannons 1-0 in a nine-inning game May 23, then beat the Edmonton Trappers 7-0 
in a seven-inning game May 28. 
</P>
<P>
However, the White Sox have no plans to promote Drees. In fact, the team has 
already told the pitcher to report to the Florida Instructional League after 
the PCL season, beginning in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver pitching coach Moe Drabowsky said Drees, 11-10, needs to develop more 
consistency and to strengthen his pitching shoulder, which was operated on last 
December.

A former White House chief of staff and Jeb Bush, son of President Bush, are 
part of a group formed to bring an NFL team to Jacksonville, a newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be announcing that an ownership group and/or somebody seeking to bring 
an NFL franchise to Jacksonville is in place," Dave Clavier, a public relations 
consultant for the group, told the Florida Times-Union. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Bush, who has served as Dade County Republican chairman and Florida 
secretary of commerce, is a Miami businessman. The former White House aide is 
Hamilton Jordan, who served under then-President Jimmy Carter and is 
commissioner of the Assn. of Tennis Professionals headquartered in Ponte Vedra 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Jacksonville business leaders Wednesday, Jacksonville Chamber 
of Commerce Chairman Mark Hulsey said the group represents a major step forward 
in the city's efforts to bring pro football to the little-used 80,000-seat 
Gator Bowl.
