ELECTIONS: RIVALS FOR A SAN DIEGO SCHOOL BOARD SEAT HAVE FOCUSED THEIR BATTLE 
ON THE WORDING OF THEIR CAMPAIGN STATEMENTS.

Is Scott Harvey a lobbyist and not an educator? Is John de Beck a paid union 
agent instead of a schoolteacher? 
</P>
<P>
The Battle of the Campaign Statements heated up Thursday between the two 
finalists for San Diego city schools board Seat C -- representing Point Loma, 
Linda Vista and downtown -- with a series of charges and countercharges between 
De Beck and Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the San Diego Teachers Assn., whose political action committee 
pumped more than $15,000 into its support of De Beck during the June primary, 
charged Thursday that Harvey lied on the campaign statement he submitted for 
the sample ballot booklet that voters will receive before the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who on the primary ballot identified himself as a businessman, has 
changed his occupation to "educator and public policy analyst and 
parent/community leader." 
</P>
<P>
"On his ballot description, Scott Harvey, a lifelong lobbyist, identifies 
himself as an 'educator,' " said Hugh Boyle, president of the teachers union. 
"As a lifelong teacher . . . I strongly object to the casual use of the term 
educator by Mr. Harvey. If I bang some nails at home, am I a carpenter? If I 
change a light bulb, am I an electrician?" 
</P>
<P>
"Does he face 35 students all day in an elementary classroom, or 175 students 
in a high school or middle school each day?" asked Boyle, who has filed a 
written request with Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack to disallow Harvey's 
claim as misleading and inaccurate under provisions of the election law. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck chipped in with his own criticism, accusing Harvey "of false and 
misleading" statements. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Harvey must be ashamed of his occupation," said De Beck, who retired in 
June from Garfield continuation high school after 37 years as a teacher and 
counselor in the San Diego Unified School District. "When he calls himself an 
educator, that really was an insult to all of us who worked hard to attain 
credentials to teach, counsel and administer public education this state." 
</P>
<P>
De Beck asked why Harvey dropped the lobbyist designation that was part of his 
primary ballot statement and switched to public policy specialist and educator. 
</P>
<P>
"If my opponent is careless with the truth about his occupation, then the 
voters must be cautious about his other statements," De Beck said, defending 
his deviation from educational issues of overcrowding, curriculum reform and 
student health. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey fired back strongly Thursday, defending his use of educator by saying he 
has frequently given talks in classrooms as an invited speaker and taught a 
course at National University. He said Boyle's action shows that his opponent 
is a stalking horse for an attempt by the teachers union to gain a seat on the 
five-member board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you have to belong to the San Diego Teachers Assn. to be an 
educator," said Harvey, a former intergovernmental affairs specialist for the 
city of San Diego before going into private consulting and lobbying. "I have 
spent 18 years of my life educating -- I have been invited into classrooms 
individually to be part of panels, to talk about the structure of government, 
about government finance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have taught a graduate course at National University and have lectured there 
frequently. I am already lined up to talk at Clairemont and Castle Park high 
schools this fall." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said his use of the term does not imply that he is a full-time teacher. 
"In that case, I would have used the word teacher," he said. Although educator 
is a change from his primary booklet statement, Harvey said, it is more 
accurate. "I am so much more than (a lobbyist). . . . My statement was changed 
to present a more complete picture of myself and reflect the breadth of my 
experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey also attacked De Beck's ties with the teachers union in his statement, 
which says, "Don't let labor unions set school policy!" in bold lettering and 
calls De Beck "a former union agent whose campaign is paid for by a union 
political committee." 
</P>
<P>
"That reflects the fact that he sat as a union negotiator across the table from 
the (board of trustees) for many years" in salary negotiations, Harvey said. "I 
question whether it is proper to have a union person on both sides of the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said he will file his own written appeal to McCormack asking that De 
Beck be required to add the word retired in front of his statement calling 
himself a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK with me," De Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
As to the PAC support, De Beck said he has no regrets over accepting it. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you add its $15,000 to the $7,890 I raised (through his own 
committee), that is less than what Harvey spent ($24,000) to get 26.5% of the 
primary vote, compared to my 61%." (School board candidates run only in their 
districts during the primary. The two top vote-getters run citywide in 
November.)

Capitalizing on the 20th anniversary of the vanity license plate in California, 
an auto products company held a contest to come up with the most creative

A panel of TV comedy writers judged more than 600 entries from across the 
nation, including IVBNFXD (a vasectomy patient), NAG NAG (owner of a horse 
trailer for two), BRTQLIT (a speech therapist), and OUT50GZ (a Mercedes owner, 
Linda Ressler of Valencia). 
</P>
<P>
The winner of a slew of prizes from Eagle One was Robert P. Schneider, a 
Hollywood film production manager, whose plate reads: IM2BZ2P. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider says the phrase refers to the fact that he puts in 16-hour days while 
working on a movie.

Ah, friendly Westwood Village -- home of overpriced designer-goods shops, a

leave, and theaters that display signs warning against pickpockets. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, a new down-home feature: The Village Theater has an automated box 
office with a recording that croaks out the $7 ticket price. One worker 
theorized that the disembodied voice was installed because the bosses didn't 
trust the employees to announce the correct prices.

In "Heat Wave," the TV movie about the Watts riots that played the other night,

Wondering about the mathematics of those billboards around town that assert

</P>

Only in L.A. hates to quibble. But we collected only 1.7 gallons Thursday

"The line was started and maintained by the Phi Delta Theta fraternity (on the

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE RESTS IN RETRIAL OF ACTOR TODD 
BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense in the assault retrial of actor Todd Bridges rested Thursday 
without Bridges taking the witness stand, even though the actor's lawyer had 
told jurors he would testify. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran told reporters that he decided not to call 
Bridges, 24, as a witness after prosecutors did not call the shooting victim or 
an alleged accomplice as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured why put Todd up there?" Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman rested his case Wednesday after presenting 
only one day's worth of witnesses. Hodgman declined to comment on why he did 
not call the alleged victim, convicted Texas drug dealer Kenneth "Tex" Clay, or 
an alleged accomplice of the defendant's, Harvey Duckett. 
</P>
<P>
Clay testified at the first trial that Bridges shot him eight times on Feb. 2, 
1989, inside a South-Central Los Angeles cocaine rock house.

REPORT OFFERS SUGGESTIONS TO MEND POWAY'S MIGRANT PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRANTS: PANEL FORMED AFTER LAST YEAR'S RACIAL INCIDENT URGES REFORMS FOR 
LEGAL MIGRANTS, BUT ELIMINATION OF THE CAMPS OF ILLEGAL WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If Poway can bring its legal migrants into the mainstream of the community, by 
providing housing and full-time jobs for the newcomers, ethnic friction will 
wane in the North County community, a new city report says. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to its charitable attitude toward legal immigrants, the report 
called for wiping out the makeshift encampments of illegal workers in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The report is the result of a 16-month study by a citizens' committee formed 
early last year, after a Poway teen-ager reported that she had been raped by 
several migrants and sheriff's deputies rounded up more than 80 Latino men, 
women and children for questioning. The rape charges later were found to be 
baseless. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same problems as anyone else," said Rick Howard, city management 
analyst who provided staff support to the nine-member group. "Migrants are 
involved in minor crimes, shoplifting, drunkenness, loitering in the evening 
and on weekends. But, as the report points out, the rate of crime among 
migrants here is about the same as the population at large." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Emery, Poway councilman and an Escondido schoolteacher, started the Migrant 
Worker Relations Committee after the mass arrest of migrants raised racial 
tensions in the community. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, to be presented to the Poway City Council in September, the 
committee also blasts state and federal officials for leaving the burden of the 
alien problem to local governments. 
</P>
<P>
"With the abdication of federal and state authorities of their responsibilities 
in these areas of social services, housing, legal assistance, etc., other 
agencies must pick up the slack, and most often that agency is the city," the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a refugee situation, but without normal assistance given to refugees 
such as temporary housing, medical relief, legal aid and relocation assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"At no other time in our history have we thrown open the doors to such a mass 
migration without providing at least the barest support for the immigrants. The 
federal government, for all intents and purposes, has washed its hands of the 
ensuing impacts and has, in effect, declared the border open," the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The report offers nine recommendations for improving relations that clearly 
define benefits for the city's more permanent, legal migrant population and 
call for removal of the outlying migrant camps occupied mainly by undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"For health and safety reasons, the city of Poway should continue to pursue the 
elimination of illegal migrant camps," the report recommended. The Poway City 
Council had begun consideration of an ordinance outlawing the makeshift migrant 
encampments last year but suspended its action until the committee studied the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
During its discussions, "no topic was more difficult to focus upon than illegal 
encampments," the report said. "The committee made field visits to camps and 
occupied 'abandoned' houses. The squalor, safety hazards and lack of sanitation 
facilities were overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of sanitation facilities within the camps is obvious. Toilet 
facilities are the open ground. The 'shower' at one camp was a waterfall 
created by runoff. Cooking facilities range from open fires to Coleman stoves 
to makeshift propane 'stoves.' 
</P>
<P>
"All of the above conditions dictate that the city of Poway continue its policy 
of camp eradication," the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway group rejected the idea of establishing a Poway migrant hiring hall 
after visiting the one in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rauch, one of the committee members, explained that "we don't have the 
same problem here of large numbers of migrants congregating on street corners 
to wait for work," he said. "I don't think the reason for the (Encinitas) 
hiring hall was to help the migrants. I think it was to pacify the residents 
and merchants. After talking with them, it didn't seem to be working all that 
well, anyway. It only works if the employers cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
However, another committee member, Helen Wilson, felt that the Encinitas hiring 
hall was "a very successful operation" that should be copied in Poway. She 
pointed out that the Encinitas hall also serves the education of the migrant 
workers and their families and disseminates information to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We did accomplish a lot that really needed to get done and met most of our 
goals," Wilson said. "I think that we needed to do more, but we just couldn't 
get everything done." 
</P>
<P>
Housing for legal migrants, especially those with families, "probably was the 
No. 1 issue" the committee tackled, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the committee recommendations to provide migrant housing: 
</P>
<P>
* Adoption of a City Council policy requiring that adequate housing be 
available for agricultural workers, either on the work site or elsewhere. Amend 
some city zoning and land-use codes to allow for farm-worker housing and mobile 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Use of city redevelopment agency funds to provide rent subsidies for migrant 
workers, especially those with families. 
</P>
<P>
* Designation of temporary housing during inclement weather at locations around 
Poway, including church social halls, community centers and senior-citizen 
buildings, social and fraternal organizations and the Lake Poway pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of "mini-barracks" at or near sites of migrant worker job sites 
was discussed in the report, but not recommended because the dormitory-type 
structures are "inconsistent with the General Plan." 
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations of the committee dealt with creation of a regional 
organization "to apply political pressure" for legislation to address the 
national problem of immigration; dissemination of information, in both Spanish 
and English, about the programs available; creation of a community awareness 
program "to alleviate fears and misunderstandings and promote openness 
throughout the community"; and expansion of educational opportunities for 
Poway's new migrant population. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Perez, one of the committee members, said the group worked innumerable 
hours trying to resolve differences of opinion and exploring avenues that would 
lead to a better understanding between Poway residents and the new migrant 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to defuse the situation. We brought in a lot of people with 
expertise; we asked a lot of opinions; we visited other communities to find out 
what they were doing and how it was working. We didn't want to reinvent the 
wheel," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the committee will meet for a final session Monday to give final 
approval to their report. It then will go to the City Council for 
consideration.

DATA BANK TAKES ON DAY-LABORER PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael MacBeane of Santa Clarita says he may have found a way to get day 
laborers off the streets and into regular jobs. 
</P>
<P>
And all it will take, MacBeane says, is his personal computer, some volunteers 
and some willing employers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning MacBeane, 23, unveiled plans for a computerized job bank to 
match employers with the scores of Latino laborers who gather at street corners 
along San Fernando Road in Newhall each morning in search of a day's work. 
Merchants up and down the street have complained in recent months that large 
crowds of workers scare off customers and create a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
MacBeane's idea is simple: Workers will enter their names in the job bank, 
indicating what kind of work they can handle. When an employer needs workers, 
the job bank will pass on the name of laborers and where they can be reached. 
If the workers don't have telephones, the job bank will pass on messages. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't have to sit on the street anymore," MacBeane said as he showed off 
the bilingual computer program at The Mail Handler, a postal outlet MacBeane 
owns along San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
MacBeane said he has enlisted the aid of Centro de Amor, a Latino religious 
organization down the street, which will serve as headquarters for the program. 
MacBeane has notified about 65 restaurants and construction companies that the 
service is available and, beginning today, volunteers will help enter 
information into the computer and distribute flyers announcing the new job 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
MacBeane said he launched the free program because he is concerned about the 
impact the laborers are having on businesses, including his own, along San 
Fernando Road. MacBeane said the job bank is a practical solution to a 
frustrating problem. It also would treat the laborers with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
"They're there for employment," he said in their defense. "They're not there to 
loiter." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Sweezer, a legal clerk who helped MacBeane organize the job bank, said 
some merchants complain about the laborers but do nothing constructive to solve 
the problem. "Their solution is to call the police," Sweezer said. 
</P>
<P>
MacBeane said he does not condone the hiring of undocumented workers but said 
he will not ask the laborers for proof of citizenship. That's a matter for the 
employers, not the job bank, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Santa Clarita Valley residents mistakenly believe that all of the workers 
are in the United States illegally, he added. "That is not the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacBeane said he hopes to win the backing of the Santa Clarita City Council, 
which has asked its staff to develop possible solutions to the day-laborer 
problem. The council is scheduled to hear staff proposals on the issue this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Some Southern California cities have created hiring programs for day laborers, 
but such an effort by a private citizen is virtually unheard of, said social 
workers familiar with the laborers. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like one of these unique individuals who says, 'Enough of this. I'm 
going to do something,' " said Leo Guerra, who specializes in day-laborer 
issues for Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an immigrant rights group in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to hand it to him," said Alfredo Vasquez, a Los Angeles County 
community worker in Newhall. "There is no other merchant in the area offering 
something like that." 
</P>
<P>
A few laborers in Newhall seemed skeptical when told of the new job bank 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if they would use the service, they shrugged their shoulders and one 
gave a noncommittal "maybe."

PALMDALE PLAN FOR TEEN-AGE CENTER RUNS INTO DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited plan for Palmdale's first indoor recreation center for 
teen-agers faltered Thursday night when the City Council delayed action on a 
proposal to lease and remodel a former downtown toy store. 
</P>
<P>
Despite months of negotiations, city officials said they had been unable to 
reach a lease agreement with the owner of the building. That news cast further 
doubt on prospects for an early opening of a center many residents say is 
desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so far apart on so many different things," said Alex Kaminar, the Van 
Nuys businessman who owns the building sought by the city. Kaminar said issues 
other than the basic $162,000 first-year price for the lease are in dispute. 
But he and city officials refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents, teen-agers and city officials in the Antelope Valley community 
have long complained that the city, despite its tremendous growth, has no 
indoor recreation facilities where youngsters can play sports or just socialize 
in a supervised setting. 
</P>
<P>
The city wants a 10-year lease for Kaminar's vacant, 32,000-square-foot 
building in Palmdale Plaza, a rundown shopping center near City Hall. The 
building at 815 E. Avenue Q-6 for years had been a supermarket, and more 
recently a toy store, which closed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The lease had been scheduled to be acted upon by the council a week ago but was 
continued. It was again on Thursday night's agenda, but council members pulled 
the item from their regular agenda and held a 50-minute, closed-door discussion 
before returning to announce another delay. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Robert Toone said he hoped the lease deal might be concluded 
by the council's next meeting on Sept. 13, but gave no assurances. Should that 
occur, though, the center still might not open for many months because of the 
time needed to transform the building. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to spend about $742,000 to prepare the building and operate it 
for the first nine months, including nearly $284,000 for remodeling, $233,000 
for operating expenses, $176,000 for staff and $49,000 for equipment. City 
officials said it would then cost about $500,000 per year to operate 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also said they hope the recreation center plan, along with a 
separate city plan to lease another adjoining store for a new city library, 
will help restore some luster to a complex that was the valley's first shopping 
center when it opened in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
John Lasagna, city parks and recreation director, said the city hopes to 
operate the center seven days a week, including night hours on most days. Plans 
include two basketball courts, areas for volleyball, badminton and activities 
classes, and a snack bar and music for teen-agers.

Palmdale, despite its population of about 56,000, has neither a city-run 
gymnasium nor a municipal recreation center. Its only indoor basketball courts 
are those at local schools, and the city's popular recreation classes and 
programs are crowded into several city buildings.

DINERS ARE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an article by Dolores Long (Valley View, July 19) on the Single Diner Social 
Club, she stated that during an interview with me regarding the club, I was 
hesitant to give the group my approval. 
</P>
<P>
Since Long did not ask me whether I approved of the club, I am not sure how she 
concocted such a distortion. 
</P>
<P>
Had she inquired, I would have been able to tell her that I very much approve 
of the club, and have helped promote it with referrals. I have been friends 
with its founder, Marilyn Wolff, since nearly the beginning of her 
organization, and have been able to watch with admiration the steady growth of 
the club resulting from the hard work, great patience, hospitable personality 
and inventive ideas that Marilyn has demonstrated during the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Long was disappointed when I did not respond positively to her 
implication during part of her questioning that this could be a "lonely hearts" 
club. That it is not. But it is an active organization for kinetic and spirited 
people who enjoy dining and traveling. The people are not "cliquey," and the 
conversation at the tables is always openly shared. It is simply a pleasant way 
to enjoy new restaurants with new people. 
</P>
<P>
I endorse and enjoy the Single Diners Social Club and encourage other singles 
to give it a try. It is a great alternate and an enjoyable way to simply get 
together with other singles for a nice couple of hours.

LAWSUITS FILED OVER CRASH OF NAVY F-14 IN EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three civilian helicopter mechanics who were injured in the 1988 crash of a 
Navy jet at Gillespie Field in El Cajon have sued the military, alleging that 
the crash was caused by negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Although no specific damage amounts were listed in the lawsuits, filed 
Wednesday in U.S. District Court, letters attached to the documents suggested 
that their cases could be settled for a combined $55.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the men -- William Grant and Edward Barnes -- were working as helicopter 
repairmen at Skydance Helicopters at the time of the Sept. 12, 1988, crash. 
Grant's wife, Laurie, is also a plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth plaintiff, Michael Taras, was working as a helicopter repairman for 
Krauss Helicopters. Taras' suit is separate from the one filed by the Grants 
and Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
Both actions allege that the Navy failed to inspect the F-14 Tomcat before the 
ill-fated flight and "carelessly" permitted the aircraft's hydraulic system to 
be "in a state of disrepair." 
</P>
<P>
The F-14 crashed at Gillespie Field after experiencing total hydraulic failure 
while on a training mission. One of the jet's two crewman was killed after 
ejecting from the disabled aircraft, the other parachuted to safety. They were 
attempting to return the disabled aircraft, which at first had suffered partial 
hydraulic failure, to Miramar Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy had faced several damage claims since the crash, which also destroyed 
about 20 aircraft and a half-dozen vehicles on the ground at Gillespie Field.

El Cajon police arrested a Spring Valley man Wednesday night after he allegedly 
held a group of store clerks hostage at knifepoint during a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Migel Angel Marrugo, 32, outside Leo's Market Wednesday about 9 
p.m., police dispatcher Patti Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
A passer-by alerted police after spotting the robbery going on at the market, 
which is in the 600 block of El Cajon Boulevard, Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
After police surrounded the building, Marrugo allegedly held the store 
employees briefly as hostages, then fled out the store's back door alone. 
</P>
<P>
Two officers arrested Marrugo outside after a short scuffle, Conrad said. No 
injuries were reported.

Police are investigating the death of a Southeast San Diego man whose body was 
found near his front doorstep Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Officers responding to a call at 7 a.m. Thursday in the 5300 block of Geneva 
Avenue found the body of Francisco Domingo Estrada, 27, just a few feet from 
the front doorstep of his home, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"His face was covered with a sweat shirt, and it appeared that he had been 
dragged a short distance," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives had reportedly last seen Estrada five hours earlier when he left the 
house on an errand, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of Estrada's death was not known.

The Balboa Park Naval Hospital is reducing some services for military 
dependents, military retirees, and retirees' dependents because some medical 
staffers have left for the Middle East, the Navy announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercy, a hospital ship, left earlier this week with medical personnel from 
San Diego on board. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, active duty patients will have priority for treatment. 
Inpatient surgery is expected to be reduced by 50%, and outpatient services 
should be reduced by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The obstetrics-gynecology department has not been affected, but the 
hematology-oncology department will not be taking new patients. 
</P>
<P>
Nonactive duty personnel who are eligible for medical services will continue to 
get treatment as staffing allows, the Navy said.

COUNTY URGED TO CONSIDER 2 ALTERNATE COURTHOUSE SITES; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: COUNCILMAN ERNANI BERNARDI SAYS TWO VACANT BUILDINGS IN HIS 
DISTRICT MIGHT BE BETTER OPTIONS THAN THE PROPOSED CHATSWORTH LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi proposed Thursday that instead of 
moving ahead with plans to build a municipal courthouse in Chatsworth, the 
Board of Supervisors should consider using an abandoned hospital in Lake View 
Terrace or a former department store in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's suggestions came two days after county supervisors voted 3 to 1 to 
move ahead with plans for the courthouse in Chatsworth, despite intense 
opposition from local residents who say the plan will bring traffic and noise 
to the residential community. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, Bernardi said either of the two 
sites in his district should be considered as an alternative to the Chatsworth 
site or as supplemental court facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Neither site is in the West Valley area, however, which is where officials have 
said the new courthouse space is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a long shot, but they're having a lot of problems in Chatsworth and 
maybe we can offer them a site," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Lake View Terrace site has good freeway access and bus 
service, making it a convenient alternative to a West Valley site. 
</P>
<P>
One of the proposed sites is the former Lake View Medical Center in Lake View 
Terrace, which includes 14 acres of land and three buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The property was seriously considered at one time as a home for a Phoenix House 
drug rehabilitation center for which former First Lady Nancy Reagan has raised 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The second site is a former Robinson's Department Store, a three-story building 
at the corner of Chase Street and Van Nuys Boulevard in Panorama City.

WEEKEND OF MILD TEMPERATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unusual low-pressure trough moving in from the Pacific Northwest will cast a 
long shadow over the West Coast this weekend, bringing with it Junelike skies, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The low-pressure trough more typical of June is keeping night and morning skies 
shrouded in clouds, but afternoons will turn sunny, said forecaster Dan Atkins. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a pleasant weekend," Atkins said. The humidity from Hurricane 
Diana is gone and temperatures are mild, just about normal for this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The high Thursday was 78 at Lindbergh Field, with a low of 69, which compares 
favorably with the norm of 78 and 67 for this time of year. The record high for 
this date was 88 in 1983; the record low was 59 in 1881. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches today and through the weekend will range from 72 to 
77, Atkins said, with a water temperature of 70 degrees. Sea breezes are 
expected to blow at 10 to 16 m.p.h., and the surf will crest at 2 to 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs will range from 77 to 82 with lows of 66 to 77, Atkins said. The 
mercury in the inland valleys is expected to rise into the mid 80s to low 90s.

So Wilson is being challenged by Feinstein to vote against the confirmation of 
Souter if Souter isn't a firm proponent of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
If justices are to be placed on the court according to their stance on this one 
issue, can we say Feinstein would fully support Souter if he was a proponent of 
abortion rights, yet legally inept? Would she have a pro-choice court, even if 
the justices couldn't tie their own shoelaces?

SO YOU WANT TO BE IN PICTURES?;

HARDER FOR SOME PEOPLE THAN OTHERS; ENTER NOW DISNEY STUDIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the Walt Disney Studios, it's no Mickey Mouse move. The Burbank company is 
launching an ambitious new program with special emphasis on developing more 
minority and women writers into "first-rate screenwriters." 
</P>
<P>
This step in the right direction may open up creative opportunities behind the 
camera to minority writers who feel shut out of the system because of sex or 
ethnicity. Disney's commitment is the biggest by any Hollywood studio to date. 
Let's hope other studios will followsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The Walt Disney Fellowship Program begins next month. The first participants 
will include 27 aspiring screenwriters -- most of them African-American, 
Latino, Asian-American and female writers ranging in age from 20 to 46. They 
will participate in a yearlong program, earning an annual salary of $30,000. 
They will work and train on developing film and television projects for four 
Disney production units: Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Walt Disney 
Pictures and Walt Disney Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's move was not entirely altruistic. The company ranked at the bottom in 
surveys of job opportunities for minority writers conducted by the Writers 
Guild of America West in 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Disney's effort is unprecedented in the number of writers and length of 
commitment. Studios generally have employed minority writers only sporadically. 
Last month, the Beverly Hills/Hollywood Chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People issued a report noting there were fewer 
opportunities for blacks in Hollywood executive suites now than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's program is likely to earn kudos from civil rights groups and the 
Writers Guild. The hiring and training of minority and women writers will 
create greater diversity behind and before the camera. They will add a new 
perspective in both product and roles. If they help to eliminate stereotypical 
Hollywood characterizations of minorities, Disney will again have helped make 
Hollywood history.

TWO MORE TAXICAB DRIVERS ASSAULTED, ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two cab drivers were beaten and robbed, bringing to three the number of 
assaults on cabbies this week, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two National City women were arrested in connection with the robbery and 
stabbing of a Diamond Cab driver about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, said Bill Robinson 
a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, Odessa Cordova, 45, and Louise Harvey, 31, hailed a cab in 
National City and directed the driver to go to an address in East San Diego, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
They allegedly ordered the driver, Jose Elguezabal, 38, to stop at the 4100 
block of Redwood Street, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the women put a knife to the driver's throat while the other took money 
from his pants," Robinson said. "One of the suspects tried to slice the victim 
across the throat." 
</P>
<P>
Elguezabal blocked the stabbing attempt, and suffered only a laceration on his 
hand, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the suspects a short distance from the crime, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the other robbery, two men beat a Yellow Cab driver and escaped with about 
$30 shortly after 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Jerry Moody. 
</P>
<P>
The men hailed the cab driver, Mark Gilligan, 41, at 16th and F streets, Moody 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilligan drove the men to the 400 block of Cedar Street, where they grabbed him 
and punched him before escaping with his money, Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still looking for suspects in that case, Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a cab driver was beaten and robbed of $140 after picking up 
a fare at a La Jolla hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials and mayoral aides have been trying to devise ways to reduce 
the number of attacks that have plagued cab drivers this summer. Officials set 
up a meeting with representatives of the city's cab companies last month after 
two drivers were shot, one fatally, during robbery attempts on consecutive 
days.

In response to Pete Wilson's savings and loan contributions: 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial ("A Good Issue, but the Wrong Man," Aug. 7) supporting Wilson in 
accepting contributions from the S&amp;L industry is premature. 
</P>
<P>
With painful knowledge of how this particular segment of our business community 
has operated in the past, it is hardly likely this immense amount of money was 
granted to Wilson because he's just a nice kid. Maybe he is a nice kid, but the 
S&amp;Ls don't give unless they can get. This is a situation which bears close 
scrutiny, and your editorial is premature.

Show Industries Inc., owner of the Music Plus chain, has charged in a complaint 
to the National Labor Relations Board that about 25 Music Plus warehouse 
workers violated federal labor law when they directed their picketing at the 
Burbank office of Shamrock Holdings Inc., a major investor in Show, said 
Michael Sitrick, a Show spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Teamsters Local 598 also picketed the North Hollywood house of Roy 
E. Disney, Shamrock's chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Show argued in its NLRB complaint that the workers, by picketing Shamrock 
instead of Show, violated national labor law, Sitrick said. Show, not Shamrock, 
determines the terms of the workers' employment, Sitrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The picketers said they were protesting an earlier move by the company to 
challenge their vote to form a union. The warehouse workers voted in November 
to form a bargaining unit under Local 598, but Show has complained to the NLRB 
that the election was faulty.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: AVANT-GARDE OUTPOST MAINTAINS NOVEL STYLE WITH 
INVENTIVE MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there are two chefs in town who would find it easier to grab a white-hot 
skillet barehanded than to write a menu that includes an unadorned, grilled 
chicken breast, they would be Chris Walsh and Gunther Emathinger. 
</P>
<P>
Given the menus they do write, however, this shared limitation translates into 
a virtue. Walsh, long a fixture in the kitchen at Hillcrest's trendy California 
Cuisine, probably was one of the few local chefs able to fill the void when 
Emathinger surrendered his saute pans at the equally trendy 515 Fifth in the 
Gaslamp Quarter to open his own new place, Falco, a few blocks up the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor of 515, Laurie Woodside, managed a nice continuation in style 
when she replaced Emathinger with Walsh. Walsh has written a pleasant summer 
menu that, as will be the case with future seasonal lists, is supplemented by a 
daily menu of some length. Even the soups show his penchant for combining 
seemingly mismatched ingredients and making the result decorative. 
</P>
<P>
One recent example finished a cream of spinach with a swirl of pasilla chile 
butter. Another, rather grandiloquently called "chilled French morning and 
evening melon soup," paired sweet honeydew and cantaloupe soups in the same 
bowl, so that the jade color of one and the dusky peach of the other played 
upon each other like two stones in a pendant. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike those chefs who save their best for the daily specials card, Walsh 
includes much that is imaginative on the standing menu. One of the more 
startling is the steak au poivre blanc, an appetizer that takes the basic idea 
of French pepper steak and turns it on its head. The dish is parsimoniously 
portioned but quite intriguing and consists of a bit of filet that has been 
coated in cracked pepper, very briefly sauteed, chilled and garnished with a 
"bread salsa" made of crumbs flavored with assorted herbs, a great many capers 
and just enough jalapeno to make the mix sprightly. This one-of-a-kind creation 
is excellent, but take note that the meat is nearly raw and it may take a 
degree of determination to take the first bite. The others follow easily. 
</P>
<P>
Among other standing appetizers, the lobster tamale is either a masterwork of 
subtlety or exceedingly bland, depending upon one's reaction to the thick layer 
of masa dough that encases the tiny, delicately seasoned morsels of lobster. 
The dough and seafood actually play nicely under the covering of 
tequila-flavored butter sauce, studded with sliced apricots that supply a sweet 
flavor that here seems not at all out of context. As a nice complement to its 
basic ingredient, the tamale is presented in a partly opened husk, which makes 
it look like a half-shucked ear of corn. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh also makes something unusual of potstickers, the Chinese fried dumplings 
that at some restaurants have usurped the place once held so securely by egg 
rolls. The bundles of soft but fairly crunchy dough are stuffed with a 
sweet-savory blend of minced chicken and Bing cherries, and served with a 
potent dipping sauce of soy and vinegar seasoned with a good deal -- but not 
too much -- of chile oil. 
</P>
<P>
The summer menu also (and rather inescapably, in this era) includes several 
pastas and pizzas, all of the designer variety. A dish of penne pasta, given a 
Mexican flavor by its garnish of manchego cheese, cubed avocado, roasted 
peppers, oregano and olive oil, was the only weak item sampled over the course 
of two recent visits. As strong as this combination of flavors might sound, in 
point of fact it was remarkably bland. 
</P>
<P>
But the flavors of ginger, garlic, lemon and Dijon mustard did join forces to 
add a spirited note to a serving of peanut-crusted pork tenderloin, the meat 
cut into several log shapes that, given their nutty armor, looked for all the 
world like a popular candy bar. Pork can be dull, but this manner of 
preparation gave the meat a thoroughly novel and somewhat Oriental flavor. An 
understated sauce of caramelized shallots and balsamic vinegar had an equally 
pleasing effect on segments of charbroiled duck, a stronger meat that can take 
a relatively subtle sauce and turn it to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The specials lists almost make the standing menu seem conservative. One 
recently offered appetizer, the "savory seafood Napoleon," not only co-opted a 
famous dessert by alternating layers of flaky pastry with a rich seafood 
filling, but finished the item with a jazzy coulis (a strained sauce) of 
rhubarb and cilantro. To effect the union of rhubarb and cilantro requires an 
open mind, to say the least, but 515 places few bars on inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
A salad of roasted peppers, on the other hand, was certainly tasty, but more 
notable for its beauty. Walsh twisted strips of yellow, red and green peppers 
into roses, gave each blossom a chive stem, and planted them all in an "earth" 
of eggplant caviar (chopped, highly seasoned eggplant); a generous splash of 
olive oil masked the plate and gave a certain smoothness to each item. 
</P>
<P>
Among entrees, a serving of flash-grilled tombo tuna required a taste for 
exceedingly rare fish, but once past that hurdle the tuna was brought along 
handsomely by its strong butter sauce, flavored with jalapeno, ginger and 
triple sec liqueur. Sweetbreads, dusted in flour and crisped in hot butter, 
were fork tender and succulent in their garnish of fresh pear chutney (very 
lightly spiced) and hazelnut liqueur glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's urge to decorate continues to the end. A fine, deeply bitter chocolate 
truffle torte arrived on a plate painted in a "stained glass" pattern of 
caramel and raspberry sauces. A richly gooey caramel-walnut torte included a 
few raisins and a layer of apricot preserves in the center as sweet surprises, 
and was placed on a plate patterned with Expressionist squiggles of chocolate 
sauce and fruit purees. These decorations, squeezed from plastic bottles, 
require little extra effort but add a good bit of class to the serving. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant will observe its second anniversary this Halloween, which seems 
an appropriate date for this artsy, avant-garde outpost in the Gaslamp. The 
high-backed booths, painted a glossy black and softened by black cushions 
splattered with bright paints, provide a look both contemporary and Bohemian. 
The walls display both a changing show of works by local artists and down-home 
posters from Wine Country vintners. 515 Fifth also is among the increasing 
number of Gaslamp eateries that offer service at sidewalk tables.

UNIQUE L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Louis R. Negrete is a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Los Angeles 
and a member of the Industrial Areas Foundation network, a minority activist 
group. He commented on the appointment of William R. Anton, a Latino, to head 
the Los Angeles Unified School District: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vision of Supt. Anton has got to go beyond individual programs. He has to 
think of a reconfiguration of the entire school system, or the schools will 
graduate (a few) success models like him while the vast masses of Latino, 
minority and poor children will go under educated. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 210 mostly Latino elementary schools, only one is at or above state 
school averages in reading, writing and math. 
</P>
<P>
He can help shape a radical vision for major change in the ways schools 
operate. The way the school district operates is just out of whack. It's 
top-heavy, too rigid. Parents don't have any real power. It's possible (to 
bring major change) because there's a national movement to restructure school 
districts. New York, Chicago, they've done it. But the challenge is not to 
imitate what Chicago has done. The challenge is to create something unique to 
the Los Angeles experience.

ADOPTEES HAVE RIGHT TO KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a birth mother. I became pregnant at the age of 18 and subsequently 
relinquished my first-born child to a process known as adoption. 
</P>
<P>
It was not my choice, but rather the decision of society as it was in 1950. I 
listened attentively to the social worker who advised me get on with my life, 
that I would have other children to replace this one, and to forget this ever 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
I did everything but the latter. Although I never forgot, I was filled with a 
sense that someday there would be that feared knock at the door. I had told my 
husband long before we married, but not our children. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter began a search for me when she was 21. It was 10 years later that I 
received my first phone call from her. But instead of being fearful of the 
contact, I was relieved, overjoyed and grateful that she was so diligent in her 
search. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it dredged up old feelings! But they came up to be healed and released, 
something I could never do alone. 
</P>
<P>
I support the right for adoptees to know their heritage and to be able to meet 
their birth parents if they so desire. It is as healing for them to find the 
missing pieces as it is for us to be found. 
</P>
<P>
How can an adoptee have a balanced sense of self-esteem when the birth parents 
and history are shrouded in secrecy, locked in sealed records? 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gritter, a social worker from Traverse City, Mich., says: "Secrecy in 
adoption is outdated. It implies something unwholesome, something shadowy. If 
we really want to convey that birth mothers are good people, then let the 
children meet them." 
</P>
<P>
In this age of extended families, why can't we all know each other without 
family members being threatened by a relationship with another? 
</P>
<P>
My daughter will be 40 this year and has chosen not to inform her adoptive 
mother of our relationship because as she puts it, "She couldn't handle that." 
This grieves me. I would like to someday talk to her. But her fear of me 
suggests that we shall never meet.

CARSON STAR THOMAS HAS TROUBLED PAST, BRIGHT FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: ALL-AMERICAN HAS PROVED HE CAN DO THE JOB ON THE FIELD, BUT MUST BECOME 
A WINNER OFF IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite his status as a high school All-American, Clayvand Thomas has a lot to 
overcome heading into the 1990 football season. 
</P>
<P>
The Carson High defensive back is recovering from a broken kneecap suffered in 
a car accident in March and he has yet to be re-admitted to the school after 
his expulsion for disciplinary reasons in February. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Thomas is confident everything will work out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll get back (into Carson) with no problem," he said. "I'm not even 
worried about that. I know they're going to watch me tight and stay on my back, 
but that's not going to be a problem. I'm going to take care of business and do 
what I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has always taken care of business on the football field. He earned 
All-L.A. City honors last season after leading Carson with six interceptions, 
including three he returned for touchdowns to set a school record. This year, 
his name has turned up on several preseason All-American lists. Street &amp; 
Smith selected him one of the top 50 seniors in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle rates Thomas among the best defensive backs to ever 
play at the school, which produced two former NFL defensive backs -- Darrel 
Hopper and Wendell Cason. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the natural instincts for the game," Vollnogle said. "He reads 
(offenses) well. He defends between the run and pass well. He breaks to the 
ball well. He has a 150 IQ on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Off the field is where Thomas has run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He missed Carson's final two games last season after he was suspended from the 
team for fighting on campus. Two months later, he was kicked out of school for 
threatening a girl who accused him, some say falsely, of being involved in 
another on-campus fight. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also admitted to ditching classes, associating with gang members and 
talking back to teachers. Not exactly the stuff of All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a hoodlum since day one," Vollnogle said. "I'd venture to say he has 
three or four pages in his (school) file of things he's done." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle, though, has never given up on his standout cornerback, who first 
started on the varsity as a sophomore and helped Carson capture the L.A. City 
4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wasn't improving all along, I'd say forget him," he said. "But he has 
been improving and getting better. He just had so far to come." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he is committed to turning around his life. 
</P>
<P>
Since his hospitalization for injuries suffered in the car accident, Thomas has 
restored order to his life with the help of behavioral counseling. Looking 
back, he said his problems stemmed from a lack of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most painful is the knowledge that he let his teammates down after 
being suspended for fighting. Without Thomas at cornerback, Carson was upset, 
26-15, by Dorsey in the L.A. City 4-A championship game. Earlier in the season, 
Thomas helped the Colts defeat Dorsey, 29-8. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret the whole season last year," he said. "My 10th grade year, I hung 
around with a lot of guys on the team. They kept me together. Last year when I 
was playing, I drifted off in my own little world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be different this season. I look at things differently. I used 
to ditch, but there's not going to be any more ditching. Everyone I tell that 
to laughs at me. They don't believe me, but I've changed." 
</P>
<P>
One of the changes Thomas plans to make is in his attire. In the past, he has 
favored the flamboyant clothes and accessories worn by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to dress like a thug," he said. "I'm not going to do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vollnogle: "He hung around with the wrong guys. He was always where he 
shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was in the wrong place at the wrong time March 12. He was riding with a 
friend in a Suzuki Samurai when the vehicle was broadsided by another car. 
Thomas, who wasn't wearing a seat belt, was ejected from the back and suffered 
a broken right kneecap and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to hold onto something, but I just flew," he said. "It happened too 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which occurred while Thomas was attending Narbonne after his 
expulsion from Carson, has put his senior season on hold. He hopes to be ready 
for the Colts' season opener Sept. 14 against Bishop Amat, but that depends on 
how fast he can rehabilitate his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
The kneecap has healed following surgery and a dislocation that occurred in a 
passing league game in June. But the muscles surrounding the joint are still 
recovering. He is making progress by riding a stationary bicycle and attending 
physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have to do is strengthen my thigh and my calf, and my knee won't be a 
problem," Thomas said. "I'm not in a rush anymore to come back. I'm not going 
to participate in physical fitness (which starts Monday) or hell week. 
</P>
<P>
"I might be able to come back for the first game. It depends on how hard I 
work. My muscles are starting to come back now, so I don't think it will be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle would like to see Thomas take it slow and easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best thing that can happen for him is if he starts playing halfway 
through the season," he said. "I think it will be difficult for him to be ready 
in September. He hasn't done anything since the first of December. That's a 
long layoff." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has used the layoff to catch up on his schoolwork. He completed four 
classes after the accident last spring and this summer he is taking economics 
and Spanish at Carson Christian. He does most of the work at home. 
</P>
<P>
Because Thomas has worked diligently to earn class credits -- summer school 
will put him ahead of schedule -- Vollnogle believes Thomas will be re-admitted 
at Carson without much resistance from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
"He might not be attending Carson High School, but I wouldn't bet on it," 
Vollnogle said. "I know the guy well enough to know that he bounces back. I'm 
sure they're going to let him back in." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas knows that in order to fulfill his dream of playing college football he 
will have to perform as well in the classroom as he does on the field. That 
means approaching high school with a more serious attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Carson used to be boring to me," he said. "But now I'm going to make it into a 
fun place." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he fell into a pattern last year of trying to get away with as much 
as he could. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed as many as 20 days in certain classes and still passed," he said. "I 
became a lazy person." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of behavioral counseling, Thomas has a new outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to put more into school and listen to my parents more," he said. 
"(Counseling) made me look at myself and what type of person I am. I wake up 
every morning now and think about what needs to get done. Before, I never 
looked to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
Denard Jefferson, Thomas' godbrother and a former Carson offensive lineman, has 
noticed the change in his friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more positive than he was last year," Jefferson said. "He works hard 
every day. If he can't go to his therapy, we work out on the street. I really 
think he has his head on straight after what he went through." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle is glad to hear those kind of reports. He remembers a different 
Clayvand Thomas, a player who frequently tested his patience. 
</P>
<P>
"His biggest problem has been his mouth," the coach said. "He was that way in 
football meetings. Invariably, I would have to tell him to shut up. I don't 
know if he was bored or what. I think he needed the attention." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle, who has announced he will retire after the season, remembers a 
warning he gave Thomas during the player's sophomore year. 
</P>

"I told him the two of us weren't going to get out of here together," he said. 
"I knew I wasn't going to change, so told him: 'Either you change, or you're 
history.' " 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Vollnogle was nearly a prophet. But Thomas has every 
intention of finishing his high school career alongside the winningest coach 
(298-75-1) in state history. He has even told Vollnogle he is going to help 
Carson capture the mythical national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Voll expects me to be a leader," he said. "He doesn't have to tell 
me that. I think he knows I can take care of the job. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in 10th grade, I used to have fun a lot. I used to joke around a 
lot. I guess he didn't like that. But now I listen to what Voll has to say. I 
really don't get out of control anymore."

LOYOLA'S FAST BREAK COULD BE EVEN FASTER THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's Loyola Marymount basketball team could be even faster than last 
season's, but that premise might depend on the health of the fast break's 
linchpin, Tony Walker. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' speedy point guard played his entire junior season with a damaged 
right wrist -- his shooting hand -- and had surgery in May. This week the pins 
were removed and Walker began rehabilitation, but he won't be allowed to shoot 
for a while and has not played in several months. 
</P>
<P>
Walker can scoot with the fastest guards in the country -- Coach Paul Westhead 
couples him with Corey Gaines as possibly the swiftest guards he has ever 
coached -- and led the West Coast Conference in assists with 7.1 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing coaches often say that the key to defending against Westhead's offense 
is slowing the point guard. Few teams were successful last season, as the Lions 
set an NCAA scoring record by averaging 122.4 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
If Walker is healthy, he will team with junior Terrell Lowery and swingman Tom 
Peabody in the backcourt. Westhead has also recruited five guards/swingmen. 
</P>
<P>
Walker has spent an antsy summer going to classes and working out. "I'm running 
the (Manhattan Beach sand) dune and lifting weights with the left hand," Walker 
said. "I should be ready for practice but it seems to be slow healing." 
</P>
<P>
Walker broke a navicular bone in his wrist as a sophomore at Ventura College 
and the injury never healed properly. The surgery after his junior season was 
performed by Dr. Norman Zemel of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic. (Zemel 
declined to offer a prognosis.) 
</P>
<P>
Walker had the wrist taped before games last season and played with discomfort 
that limited his shooting. Although he hit 54% from the field, he attempted 
less than four shots a game and most of those attempts came off drives to the 
basket. He rarely attempted jump shots, but the tip-off on his shooting 
problems was his 59.5% accuracy on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said if his wrist heals, Loyola fans will see more offense from him. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot (of pain) but I didn't make no excuses," Walker said. "It hurt 
plenty of times in practice, but once I got in games, you get the adrenaline 
going and it's OK. Then it really hurt after. That's why I didn't shoot jumpers 
-- it hurt so much to release, I basically didn't shoot all year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can shoot. People basically haven't seen (my jump shot)." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Loyola will be a guard-oriented team is because Per Stumer 
has signed with a pro team in his native Sweden. Stumer, a husky 6-foot-7 
veteran of international play, had a year of eligibility remaining at Loyola. 
He was among the team's leading rebounders the past two seasons and often 
defended against the opponents' toughest front court players. He also had a 
deft three-point shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
Stumer, who has a commitment to the Swedish National Team that is trying to 
qualify for the 1992 Olympics, felt he had been away from home long enough and 
was ready for the next step in his basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
He played in the Summer Pro League at Loyola last month, but was getting so 
little playing time that he returned to Sweden, where he joined Team Albik in 
Stockholm. He had signed a conditional contract with Albik in May. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone, Stumer said he signed a contract for about $50,000 -- "We 
have high taxes here but it's enough to live on," he said -- and has joined the 
Swedish National Team for tournaments in Poland and Finland in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play here this season, then hopefully play in the summer league (at 
Loyola)," he said. "I wouldn't mind playing a couple years in the NBA -- that 
would be a high goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish National Team faces European Championship qualifying rounds in the 
fall, when the Swedes need to beat Greece and, most likely, Romania to get to 
next summer's championship round, which will decide teams for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Stumer will also stay busy trying to help Albik, which he described as "one of 
the country's top teams in the early '80s, now it's an in-between team but 
trying to get big again." 
</P>
<P>
Stumer won't forget his record-setting years at Loyola, which made an 
impression even in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"All my friends and most of my coaches asked about Loyola," he said. "They've 
heard about them." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills, which begins its fall athletic session Aug. 24, has 
added several assistant coaches to its staff. Soccer Coach Marine Cano, who 
will continue to coach both the men's and women's teams, will be assisted by 
Alberto Bru, a starting fullback for the California Emperors of the American 
Professional Soccer League. Bru will help out with the teams, replacing Paul 
Krumpe and John Gerrard, who have other commitments this season. Cano will also 
be assisted by former players Joe Flanagan (with the men's team) and Connie 
Cowman (with the women's team). Flanagan and Cowman will be graduate 
assistants. The men's team plays its first scrimmage Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Coach George Wing will have a new No. 1 assistant in Tom Pokorski, who 
was an assistant at Mt. San Antonio College last season. His main 
responsibility will be the pitching staff, which was the Toros' weak point last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball Coach Dave Yanai will be assisted by former Toro guard Tony 
Carter-Loza. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Pepperdine point guard Lamar (Marty) Wilson has joined basketball Coach 
Tom Asbury's staff as a part-time assistant. Wilson, 23, who graduated from 
Pepperdine in 1989, succeeds Bob Hawking, who accepted an assistant coaching 
spot at UC Davis last month. Wilson was an assistant coach at Simi Valley High 
last season. . . . Loyola Marymount is still looking for an athletic trainer to 
replace Chip Schaefer, who took a similar job with the Chicago Bulls after 
three years at Loyola. . . . Loyola baseball Coach Chris Smith is working to 
replace three assistants who accepted different jobs after the season. The 
staff may be set by next week. . . . Morningside High basketball star Martell 
Bland has signed with St. Mary's College. He's the second South Bay player to 
sign with Coach Paul Landreaux, joining Darrell Daniel of Bishop Montgomery. 
Bland, a 6-3 guard, averaged 18 points and was a member of the Times All-South 
Bay team.

CRAIG GREBECK IS CHICAGO'S LITTLE BIG MAN FOR A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diminutive rookie Craig Grebeck could stand on a pile of baseball record books 
and still be looking up to the accomplishments of future Hall of Fame pitcher 
Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
But one day, Grebeck, who at 5-foot-6 is the smallest player in the American 
League, rose above Ryan and his record collection. 
</P>
<P>
Grebeck, the former Cal State Dominguez Hills standout, shocked Ryan with his 
first major league home run, a three-run shot to help the Chicago White Sox 
complete a doubleheader sweep, 5-2, 5-1, over the Texas Rangers Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll remember this homer as long as I live," Grebeck said. "It came off one of 
the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Grebeck, who was recalled from the minor leagues Aug. 2, waited until his 69th 
at-bat before hitting his first home run. He had a .118 batting average with 
three runs batted in in 37 games before his confrontation with Ryan. He drove a 
Ryan fastball into the left-field stands in the second inning after a one-out 
double and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan had just walked a guy and with Ron Karkovice on base, I figured Ryan 
wants to make a good pitch, but he made it too good," Grebeck said. "When I hit 
it, I usually know the ball is going a long distance, but since I'm a little 
guy I don't try to hit homers." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan will remember Grebeck's home run as a footnote to his 269th career defeat 
and his second consecutive loss since won his 300th game. 
</P>
<P>
"When Grebeck hit that first pitch, I knew he hit it good," Ryan said. "I felt 
like I had better stuff than the last three or four outings, but I simply made 
some bad pitches, and it doesn't make any difference who's at bat." 
</P>
<P>
Grebeck can't wait for another round. That night the drinks were on him. 
</P>
<P>
No handouts -- Reliever Scott Neill, a former Loyola Marymount College 
standout, continues to receive requests to hand over a baseball, but it no 
longer means that he's being taken out of a game. Nowadays, Neill is being 
hounded by souvenir collectors, not angry managers. 
</P>
<P>
In the bullpen, Neill gets tapped on his cap by young fans requesting 
autographs. Neill tries to ignore the fans because it's against league rules to 
give away baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could sign every piece of paper and hand out a ball to every fan that 
requested one, but I can't," said Neill, who nevertheless enjoys the attention. 
"The umpires really watch us when a foul ball goes into the bullpen. We get 
fined for every ball we throw into the stands." 
</P>
<P>
A long reliever for the Cleveland Indians Class A team in Kinston, Ohio, Neill 
has an impressive 8-3 record with a 2.66 earned-run average entering this 
week's games. He pitched 28 2/3 scoreless innings until Greg Blosser of the 
Lynchburg Red Sox ended the streak with a home run two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a first-round draft pick to score a run off me," said Neill of 
Blosser, who was the Boston's top pick in the 1989 June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
No one thought Neill would be holding a baseball after graduating from Loyola 
Marymount in 1988. He had an unimpressive 5-4 record as a senior with the Lions 
and his fastball was judged to be too slow by professional standards. 
</P>
<P>
After being bypassed in the 1988 draft, Neill played with the Santa Maria 
Indians, a semi-pro team near his hometown of San Luis Obispo. Neill impressed 
an umpire, who had connections with major league scouts, and was signed as a 
free agent by the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a really slow process," Neill said. "I started at the bottom and 
have moved up one level at a time. I've been pretty close to the 10th and last 
man on every pitching staff until last year." 
</P>
<P>
Neill, 23, had his best minor-league season in 1989 when was 3-2 with a 1.80 
ERA as the stopper for Watertown, N.Y. (Class A). 
</P>
<P>
During spring training, Neill changed his delivery to become more of a side-arm 
pitcher and received a promotion to Kinston where he gained popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally had to tape a piece of paper to my hat that said, 'I don't give away 
baseballs,' " Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't been giving away too many runs, either. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of trouble -- Taunting can get pretty bad in the minor leagues, 
especially in North Carolina where Kinston plays the Durham Bulls, a team that 
became popularized by the movie "Bull Durham." The field is favorite hangout 
for college students attending nearby Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
In the season's first series, Kinston reliever Greg Ferlinda walked to the 
mound with the score of the NCAA basketball championship taped to his back. His 
handmade sign read: "UNLV 103, Duke 73." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't there, but I heard that sign silenced the crowd," Neill said. "We 
already have a pretty good rivalry with Durham, but I think that added to the 
intensity of our games. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to draw big crowds whenever we play there."

BEACH NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS COMPETE FOR HIGH STAKES IN LAUGHLIN, NEV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stakes have been steadily rising in women's pro beach volleyball 
tournaments in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
So it's fitting that the marquee event of the season will be played this 
weekend at little Las Vegas on the Colorado River -- Laughlin, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the major sponsorship of the Flamingo Hilton, cable television 
coverage and a handful of other sponsors, the women's tour has taken off this 
year. The women's purses haven't reached the levels of their male counterparts, 
but the tour's top players are making a comfortable living. 
</P>
<P>
"This year has been a major turning point for our sport," said four-year pro 
Patty Dodd of Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's World Championships in Laughlin carries a purse of $50,000 -- 
the second-biggest on the women's circuit and roughly equal to the standard 
weekly package on the men's tour. 
</P>
<P>
The event is one of 10 women's tournaments televised by ESPN. The Nevada-based 
Flamingo Hilton chain scheduled the tournament to parallel this month's opening 
of its newest luxury resort on the banks of the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows, maybe if you can't win on the court, maybe you can win a little on 
the blackjack tables," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors at Laughlin will have to find a way to stop Jackie Silva -- a 
Redondo Beach resident by way of Brazil -- and her partner, Karolyn Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, the tour's top money winner the past two seasons, has overcome a series 
of nagging injuries -- a sore back, shoulder and ankle -- to win more than 
$35,000 this season, which is more than all but a dozen men's beach pros. 
</P>
<P>
Silva is indisputably the best player on the tour. But Dodd thinks much of the 
tandem's recent success is due more to Kirby's development. 
</P>
<P>
"Karolyn is playing better right now than anybody on the tour," Dodd said. "Her 
jump serve has really come along, and it's such a great strength for that 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Kirby played six tournaments together at the start of this season 
before Silva lured Kirby to her side. After switching partners two more times, 
Dodd is settling in this weekend with her fourth teammate of the year, Lisa 
Strand. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot Strand from the University of Hawaii is one of the tour's most 
dynamic young pros. She teamed with San Juan Capistrano's Janice Opalinski to 
shock everybody in the Tokyo Open late last month, knocking Silva and Kirby 
into a fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dodd had struggled with Rita Crockett-Royster, finishing third once 
and fourth twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a partner-switch for the future," Dodd said. "I don't want to be stranded 
without a partner at the beginning of next year." 
</P>
<P>
She won't if Strand sticks around. 
</P>
<P>
Playa del Rey's Tim Hovland is predicting big things for himself and partner 
Kent Steffes in the final two events of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hovland and Steffes are seeded third this weekend at the $60,000 Seattle 
Seafair Open. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the two skipped the Seal Beach Open to play in an exhibition 
tournament in Linguano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
For the mercurial Hovland, who played six years in the Italian Professional 
indoor league and speaks fluent Italian, it was a happy return. He and Steffes 
won "substantially more" for their victory in Linguano than if they had won at 
Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a volleyball hero in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy was great," Hovland said. "We beat everybody up pretty bad and showed 
them how to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
Hovland, who is a ferocious blocker, and Steffes -- a cat-quick athlete with a 
devastating jump serve -- are easily the tour's most physical team when their 
games are on. 
</P>
<P>
But in last week's Cuervo Gold Crown event in San Diego, Sinjin Smith and Randy 
Stoklos played the parts of the cunning veterans, downing Hovland-Steffes, 
15-6, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"Sinjin and Randy have the experience," Hovland said. "But we're just getting 
over being a little nervous and we're starting to play calm, cool and 
collected. We're the new team on the block, so we've got nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
The most powerful hitters on the beach tour hammer the volleyball at about the 
same speed as many major league pitchers throw a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of Volleyball Professionals put a radar gun on the sport's top 
athletes in early June in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Ayakatubby is the tour's third-most powerful spiker, with an average of 
90.75 m.p.h. on his put-aways. Former Olympian Steve Timmons is second at 91.25 
m.p.h., and local favorite Brent Frohoff is fifth at 89.2. 
</P>
<P>
Pono Ma'a, who splits his residences between his native Hawaii and Los Angeles, 
where he is a part-time model, was clocked at 89.6. 
</P>
<P>
The tour's heaviest hammer belongs to the muscular Stoklos, who recorded a 
circuit-best 94 m.p.h., with an average of 91.6. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dodd -- Patty's husband -- still owes his wife a set of golf clubs for her 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd is an avid golfer and his wife has been yearning to take up the sport with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and beach-rival Frohoff often golf together during the week after playing 
volleyball -- sometimes at Manhattan Beach Country Club, or sometimes at the 
Rolling Hills Country Club, where the Dodds are members. 
</P>
<P>
Frohoff and Dodd have about a 12 handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"On any given day we can beat each other," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd figures about a dozen beach pros are addicted to golf. He wants to 
continue playing golf long after his volleyball career ends. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to play on the Senior PGA tour after I turn 50," Dodd said. "Or 
maybe they'll set up a senior golf tour for retired beach players." 
</P>
<P>
If Patty gets her way, they might have to set up a ladies' version, too. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach has always been one of the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals' most enterprising surfers. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has modeled for Calvin Klein underwear and has dabbled recently in 
snow-boarding. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, he made it to the final of the $50,000 Salt Creek Beach Pro-Am in 
Laguna Niguel along with Dino Andino, Vince De La Pena, and eventual winner 
Matt Archbold. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's off to France for a series of ASP events, but not before giving 
Oakland Athletic slugger Jose Canseco a run for his money on the 900 toll 
telephone number market. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and two Manhattan Beach buddies have set up a 900 number for surf 
enthusiasts who want to get advice from the top surfers on the ASP 
international tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids can call in and punch in a code to pick the surfer they want to 
listen to," Robinson said. "If they want to listen to Martin Potter talk about 
floaters (surf maneuvers), they'll dial one number. If they want to hear Derek 
Ho talk about surfing pipeline, they punch in another number." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's taped interviews begin operation on Aug. 20, on the 1-900-PRO-SURF 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson sees a legitimate demand for his service from the market of young 
waterlogged beach rats. 
</P>
<P>
After all, even Jose can't do a floater.

DIGEST: WESTLAKE'S FISHER TAKES NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Fisher, former athletic director at Westlake High, has taken over as 
principal at Santa Paula High. Fisher, who replaces Hank Johnson, was hired 
last week and assumed his new post Monday. Jack Loritz succeeded Fisher at 
Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 52, leaves the Conejo Valley Unified School District after 28 years of 
service, including 16 years as an administrator, the past four as the Westlake 
athletic director. He had been transferred this summer from Westlake to Conejo 
Valley High, a continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher attended UCLA on a basketball and track scholarship after graduating 
from Hart High in 1956. He played for John Wooden at UCLA and was a teammate of 
Denny Crum, the Louisville coach. He also ran track with Olympian Rafer 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula celebrated its 100th anniversary last year and the town passed a 
bond issue last spring to allocate more funding for education. Fisher, whose 
first duties include finding a basketball coach, said he is excited about the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a really great community with a lot of potential," he said. "They've 
been a little down in athletics but we expect to improve that." 
</P>
<P>
A Glendale all-star team has advanced to the finals of the junior (ages 11-12) 
division of the softball Little League World Series in Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (2-0) will play Tallmadge, Ohio (2-1) at 3 p.m. today. Glendale can 
claim the title with a win over the team it beat earlier in the tournament, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
A Glendale loss would force a deciding game between the two teams Saturday. 
Glendale beat Naples, Fla., 2-1, to advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Another Glendale team also is still alive in the senior division for players 13 
to 15. That team defeated Duncan, British Columbia, 10-2, on Thursday. The 
Glendale seniors (2-1) play Georgetown, Mich. (1-1) today at 1 p.m. The winner 
advances to Saturday's final.

FULL WEEKEND OF AUTO RACES SCHEDULED FOR VENTURA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS

DOMINGUEZ HILLS GOALIE FAILS TO SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer team began fall practice Thursday 
afternoon without goalie Jose Castenada. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for another goalkeeper," said Coach Marine Cano, who was 
counting on the Mexican National to be in goal this year. "He didn't show to 
the team meeting the day before so I assume he decided not to come. Therefore, 
I have to find someone fast." 
</P>
<P>
The Toros open the season Sept. 1 against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who is also the backup goalie for the Los Angeles Heat, said he hopes 
there is a former high school goalkeeper in the area who wants to attend 
college and play for Dominguez Hills. No one on the roster has experience at 
the position.

PEPPERDINE COACH FOX FINDS FAULT WITH PARENTS' INSTRUCTION OF KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine men's tennis co-Coach Allen Fox has a message for parents who are 
thinking of coaching their children: Think again. 
</P>
<P>
"More kids have been ruined by a parent as a coach than have been helped," Fox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 51, a former tour player and Davis Cup team member, holds a doctorate in 
psychology from UCLA and has written several articles on the subject of 
coaching one's child. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference between pushing your child to achieve in school and 
pushing the child in sport," he said. "Sports is a pastime -- it's for fun. 
</P>
<P>
"The parent becomes too involved and doesn't know where his interest ends and 
the kid's begins." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, entering his 13th year as coach at Pepperdine, said the negative effects 
of a parent's coaching his child can be early burnout for the athlete, 
incorrect instruction and the ruining of one or more family relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"When a coach criticizes you, that's one thing. But the coach you can leave -- 
the parent you can't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox acknowledges that there are exceptions to his rule. He cited the success of 
several parent-child teams, such as those involving Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, 
Jimmy Connors, and Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
"Capriati's parents do a good job with her," said Fox. "You can tell she's 
well-balanced and stable and gets lots of love. Her dad coaches her without 
attacking her. You look at her face and you can tell she's happy. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is no good documentation on the parents who coached their kid and 
ruined them, because those kids obviously didn't get far," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"If the kid really likes the game, he'll get good anyway. If a kid has the 
potential to be a champion, they'll develop anyway on their own -- they can do 
it without coaching," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who is writing a book on the mechanics of tennis, also wrote "If I'm the 
Better Player, Why Can't I Win?" a book published in 1979 that has sold more 
than 20,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, Fox has seen tennis players gain more attention and 
prestige, but thinks tennis has lost some of its integrity in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"There's much more money and glory now," Fox said. "Parents look at tennis as a 
way to get into show business. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth in tennis has been a negative, really, to most players -- it has 
led them astray. (Players) have given up school and their education, family 
values and life in order to pursue this potential they have in tennis," he 
said. "What if they don't make it?" 
</P>
<P>
Teens in tournaments: Nine Valley-area teen-agers took part in the U. S. Tennis 
Assn. national championships last week. They are Natasha Pospich of Woodland 
Hills, Meilin Tu of Northridge, Gary Potter of Thousand Oaks, Darren Potkey of 
Ventura, Derek Pope of Ojai, Staci Jellen of Calabasas, Molly White of 
Camarillo, and brothers Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Pope and John Roddick of Austin, Texas, was defeated in the boys' 
14-and-under doubles final Saturday in San Antonio. Pope and Roddick went down 
in straight sets, 7-5, 6-4, to Scott Humphrey of Alamo, Texas, and B.J. Stearn 
of New City, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In girls' 18-and-under doubles, Pospich and partner Laura Richards of Vista 
lost to Rachel and Rebecca Jensen of Norcross, Ga., 6-2, 6-4, in quarterfinal 
action at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Pospich was easily beaten, 6-1, 6-1, in the fourth round of singles competition 
last week by Lisa Raymond of Wayne, Pa., who went on to defeat her next three 
opponents in straight sets to earn the title. 
</P>
<P>
Tu came back from a 6-0 loss in the first set of her fourth-round match against 
Karen Miller of Trenton, N.J., to win, 0-6, 6-4, 6-2. But Tu was eliminated in 
the quarterfinals of the girls' 14-and-under division by Tracy Kotseos of 
Winter Springs, Fla., 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Add tournaments: The 15th tournament of the junior circuit K-Swiss Summer Grand 
Prix began Monday and will conclude today at Cal State Northridge. The 
21-tournament series will culminate in the 11th Masters Championships in North 
Hollywood. The top eight point earners from all tournaments in each of five age 
divisions will advance to the championships. 
</P>
<P>
Many current and former pro tour players have left their mark on this Grand 
Prix series. Debbie Graham of Fountain Valley, who was defeated by Martina 
Navratilova in straight sets Tuesday in the second round of the Virginia Slims 
of Los Angeles in Manhattan Beach, won the 12-and-under division title in 1982. 
Graham, 19, who played for Stanford this year, is the 1990 NCAA singles 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Team Tennis playoffs: Sectional playoffs for the USTA/Volvo Team Tennis League 
start today and continue through Sunday at Los Caballeros Sports Village in 
Fountain Valley. Eight of the 56 Southern California teams are from the Ventura 
County area. 
</P>
<P>
Winning teams in each division will advance to the national championships in 
October. More than 750 Valley-area residents took part in the league this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo event: The Cabrillo Racquet Club in Camarillo is playing host to the 
Wilson/Eagle Tennis Fest on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Five tennis pros will 
provide instruction and a radar gun will be used to clock the speed of serves.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ANTIHISTAMINE EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Everyone seems to know that antihistamines can cause a person to 
become drowsy. I know that whenever a doctor has told me to use an 
antihistamine, I'm usually warned not to drive and not to work around 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from drowsiness, are there other side effects? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Some elderly individuals who take antihistamines may experience a 
degree of confusion. In addition, antihistamines may increase the effects of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that there's no cure for a cold, but would you have any suggestions 
about how to relieve the sore throat that comes with it? I find that that's the 
worst part of a cold. 
</P>
<P>
A: There are a number of over-the-counter preparations that can ease the 
discomfort of a sore throat, including a variety of pain relievers. It might 
help if you would increase your intake of liquids and gargle with warm salt 
water. A humidifier might also relieve symptoms.

You get to know the Glass family gradually, as if you'd moved down South and 
been introduced first to Eleanor -- perhaps at a gallery opening in Atlanta, 
where she's living when the book opens. Eleanor is a painter, happily but 
uneasily married to her second husband, Will Turner, whose brisk, 
straight-ahead manner contrasts strikingly with the more complex personalities 
of his in-laws. Will arranges Southern tours for performing artists, and in 
that business, a Yankee outlook can be an asset. One by one, you meet the rest 
of Eleanor's folks: her parents,Henry and Coraruth Glass; her former 
mother-in-law, Fitz Ballard, who continues to be her confidante and friend, and 
finally, Will Turner's kid sister, Marilyn, who is still trying to resolve some 
10-year-old anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
There's also Ben Bolt, an oddball bachelor with a name from a plaintive English 
ballad, once Henry Glass's foreman at the peach cannery but now supporting 
himself with a shoe-shine stand in one of Atlanta's new office towers. 
Eleanor's brother, Lucas, is a sensitive, hard-working physician, remote both 
physically and emotionally from the rest. That's the entire cast, just the way 
you'd find them if Eleanor asked you to keep her company on the drive up the 
interstate to South Carolina on one of her frequent trips back home. 
</P>
<P>
On the road, you'd hear about Eleanor's childhood, and how she adored her 
father, trailing him everywhere, climbing the peach trees, then waiting 
patiently in the steaming cannery for him to check on the progress of the 
harvest. She'd play under the conveyor belts, listening to the Appalachian 
migrant workers talk while water from the washing vats dripped on her head and 
damp leaves stuck to her skin. "They'd stand there for hours -- their hands 
swollen and wrinkled from the water and the fuzzy peach skin -- until the lunch 
horn blew and the belt rattled and banged to a stop," when they'd break for a 
lunch of dry cheese, biscuits and sausage. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was 9, Eleanor could run the water wheel that moved the fruit 
along, and long before she could legally drive, she was taking the truck out 
into the orchards with water for the pickers . . . all of it fine training for 
an artist. Formed by that background, she still drives north often, haunted by 
the feeling that she's needed on the farm, only to find that an essential 
connection has frayed and disintegrated. "Something is gone there that once 
was, something that no amount of money or accomplishment or physical pleasure 
or other children can ever replace." 
</P>
<P>
Finding that elusive something is the subject of "The Picture Makers," and 
Ellison gives each of her major characters a chance to assist in the search. We 
hear from them in turn, at different times and in entirely distinct voices, and 
in the process we see how changes in society have impinged upon their lives and 
altered their attitudes. From Coraruth we learn that there was a middle child 
killed in an auto accident -- an incident that forever unbalanced the family 
relationships. In her breezy, outspoken way, Fitz Ballard emerges as a true 
original, a woman who has rejected the bland life of a Southern widow to become 
a crusading ecologist in late middle age, eventually embarking upon a romance 
that flouts convention to the utmost. Listening to Henry Glass reminisce about 
the recent past, we understand Eleanor's growing concern for her parents. Ben 
Bolt is heard from in a shorter segment, struggling to explain his abrupt and 
mysterious departure from the Glass farm, an event more pivotal that it seemed 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
With virtually no redundancy, each person's version of incidents augments and 
enhances the one that has gone before, until Eleanor, the artist and leading 
voice, succeeds in creating order and continuity from the shards of Glass 
history. To do that, she temporarily puts a thousand miles between herself and 
her family, an experiment that succeeds equally well for the artist as writer 
and the writer as artist.

NIGHT LIFE: NEW COMEDY CLUBS SPRINGING UP AS SAN DIEGO COUNTY RESIDENTS SPURN 
TELEVISION FOR LIVE ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable and network television brought comedy to the small screen in a big way, 
but thousands of San Diegans are leaving the electronic hearth for the warm 
glow of live comedy and triggering a comedy club boon. 
</P>
<P>
Four new comedy clubs have sprung up in the county in the past year. Hotels and 
nightclubs have joined the rush by offering weekly comedy nights. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize many of the comics' names from television, and we'd like to seem 
them live," said Mira Mesa resident Jim Snow, who was taking in a weekend show 
with his wife at The Improv in Pacific Beach. "They don't have to hold back as 
much as they do on television." 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of a treat," said Ronnie Warren, who had come down from San Juan 
Capistrano to take in the show at The Improv. 
</P>
<P>
Going to a comedy club is "different than a nightclub and a step up from a 
movie," said San Diegan Jonathon Chillas, who was at the Comedy Isle on Mission 
Bay with his girlfriend. "It's more of a show." 
</P>
<P>
People who have never been to a comedy club are often surprised by the 
experience, said Benny Ricardo, a former Chargers place-kicker who became a 
comedian and frequently performs at Oceanside's Comedy Nite club. Since it 
opened a year ago, the club has had no fewer than 6,000 people a month pass 
through its doors. 
</P>
<P>
After shows, Ricardo stands outside the club and talks to people about their 
reaction. They were afraid every word was going to be vulgar, he said. "There 
are the Andrew Dice Clays, but it's better to be clean and clever." 
</P>
<P>
Tripling the number of night clubs from two to six in a year has turned the 
county into a consumer's market with something for everyone. San Diego 
entertainment spots are offering everything from the abrasive Andrew Dice Clay, 
who has nearly sold out 7,500 seats at the Sports Arena for his appearance 
tonight, to Mrs. Hughes, billed at the Comedy Nite as "Erma Bombeck with an 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody with a flashlight and a microphone thinks they have a club,"said 
Mark Brazill, who travels the circuit to perform at the more than dozen Improv 
clubs throughout the country. Even strip joints are adding comedians to their 
performances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But each of the full-time comedy clubs has carefully carved out a niche by 
offering something a bit different to club goers, according to club managers. 
</P>
<P>
The Improv in Pacific Beach bills itself as the premier dinner cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are is a comedy cafe," said Improv manager Dave Becky of the 
5-year-old club. "It's a dinner theater. People can do an entire evening here." 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old Comedy Store in La Jolla bills itself as a place run by comics 
as a training ground for bright, new comics. The three Comedy Stores in La 
Jolla and Hollywood have spawned such stars as Robin Williams and Sam Kenison, 
manager Fred Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a comedy college," he said. "Our bartender, cashier, some of our 
waitresses and doormen are aspiring comics. They develop and become comics. We 
raise our own like a comedy stable." 
</P>
<P>
The Stand Up downtown and The Stand Up in Solana Beach bill themselves as 
smokeless comedy showcases. The downtown showcase is housed at Croce's Top Hat 
Bar and Grille, and the Solana Beach Stand Up presents its shows at Diego's 
Surfside restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is a very health-conscious city," said owner Paul Messier, who 
created the month-old twins. "We're going after the nonsmoking customers, and 
we're confident they will come out. My wife and I have 10 years in the comedy 
business. At other clubs, we got so many calls from people asking if we had a 
nonsmoking section. A lot of people don't like to go to the clubs because of 
the smoke, but they still like to drink and enjoy themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Comedy Nite, which opened in Oceanside in June a year ago, has positioned 
itself as the "king of North County comedy," owner Pierre Turgeon said. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I felt the North County was growing," he said. "We felt the North 
County could support a full-time comedy club, and we would be far enough away 
we wouldn't be in competition with the other clubs." 
</P>
<P>
The nearly year-old Comedy Isle at the Bahia Resort Hotel on Mission Bay books 
a variety of acts including comics, magicians, hypnotists, and musical comics. 
</P>
<P>
"Most comedy clubs are going with straight stand-up comics, and I'm finding out 
novelty is working for us," said manager Randy Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the full-time clubs, other entertainment venues such as Humphrey's, an 
outdoor venue on Shelter Island, and Smokey's, a rhythm and blues nightclub in 
Mission Valley, offer comedy on a periodic basis because it is a good draw, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Humphrey's is not primarily a comedy club at all, but I book headline 
comedians when I get the opportunity to," said promoter Kenny Weissberg.

"We're known for booking music, but we do book comedy," said John Nelson, 
spokesman for Bill Silva Presents, which is bringing Andrew Dice Clay to the 
Sports Arena. Clay won't be the first comic to play the arena either, said an 
arena spokesman. Eddie Murphy blazed the trail before him. 
</P>
<P>
With the mushrooming of comedy clubs and showcases has come an enormous 
increase in the number of comics. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many comics. Everybody wants to get a piece of the pie," said 
Improv manager Dave Becky. None of the comics he auditions to emcee his shows 
goes on with less than three years of experience unless they're really good. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the stage time to get that kind of experience means paying some dues in 
some very unglamorous spots, say comics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played everywhere in San Diego," said Comedy Store manager Fred Burns. 
And a lot of other cities, from Eureka to Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played lots of bars, lounges, dance places, private parties in living 
rooms and college rushes," Burns said. At the Comedy Store he went from taking 
tickets at the door to answering the phone to assistant manager and finally 
manager. He honed his skills trying out material during Open Mike Nite for 
amateurs, and watching and talking to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who has been disabled since birth, starts off his routine making fun of 
his physical condition. He hobbles on stage with the aid of crutches and peers 
out over the audience through the bright lights. The crowd falls silent at the 
sight of a handicapped comic, but he soon has them laughing with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what you're thinking -- another Elvis impersonator," he says to break 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy Nite performer Carol Hughes made her debut at The Improv in Los Angeles 
one fateful Sunday at 5 minutes to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I met a woman at a Weight Watcher's meeting who was a comedian," Hughes said. 
"I asked her how to get started, and she said write five funny minutes and go 
to The Improv." 
</P>
<P>
At The Improv, they pulled her name out of a champagne bucket, and she went on 
stage, did her five minutes worth of material, and was hooked -- at the age of 
40. 
</P>
<P>
"Comedy is the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life," said Hughes, 
who calls herself Mrs. Hughes on stage. "But it is so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' act is a tongue-in-cheek review of the trials and tribulations of 
raising children and all the real-life things that have happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two beautiful daughters and Scooter the Surfer Dude," Hughes jokes, 
referring to her son, too. "I knew babies grew into teen-agers. I just thought 
when I had mine, there would be a cure. Now I'm a grandmother, but I don't have 
any jokes about it. They live with us, and it's not funny." 
</P>
<P>
On being fat: "I went to the beach, and the lifeguard says, 'Lady, when are you 
going home. The tide would like to come in.' I didn't think I was that fat," 
Hughes tells the crowd, now screaming with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in the act is based on truth or is an exaggeration of something 
that happened to me. That is why the audience can relate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Working her way out of the legions of comic wannabees hasn't been a free ride 
though. During the eight years since her debut, she worked her way up from 
coffee shops and discos to the "Oprah Winfrey Show" and an appearance this fall 
on Fox television's "My Talk Show." 
</P>
<P>
She remembers driving for more than eight hours to get to a show and being put 
up overnight in a room where "you could see light coming through around the 
door." 
</P>
<P>
Being a woman in the world of mostly male stand-up comics is not the easiest 
trail to blaze either. 
</P>
<P>
"People do not want to hear women using bad language," said Hughes, whose act 
is clean. "Things that are a problem for women, like PMS, men don't want to 
listen to. And, sometimes, when women are being funny, men think they're 
complaining." 
</P>
<P>
"There are as many comedians as life insurance salesmen," said comic John 
Padon. He should know. He worked eight years as life insurance salesman before 
he turned to comedy. Then he tried out his material on amateur nights and sold 
cars by day. At one point, even his father asked, "are you going to laugh your 
way through life?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate that I started in Albuquerque. I had a lot more access to 
stage time, and I matured quicker. The more you do it, the funnier you get. 
It's all experience, and it's constant learning. Just the first couple of 
years, you're trying to figure out what works with an audience." 
</P>
<P>
He's perfecting a routine now about America being just one big junkie worried 
about dealers raising the price of drugs, and having its oil taken away by the 
Iraqis, Padon said. "I do think we need to find a way to ship oil without 
spilling it -- like the Colombians. Now these guys know how to ship a product. 
You never see them spilling cocaine," he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
When he started working professionally as a comic about a year ago, Benny 
Ricardo took a philosophical attitude toward his new career. In football, "I've 
bombed before 80,000 people, so what's bombing before 200 to 300 in a 
nightclub." But he works hard at writing his material because "once you get up 
there and your stuff works, it's an incredible high." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the sheer number of comedy offerings at clubs and on television and 
radio, audiences are getting more sophisticated, say both comics and club 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the audience is catching on to the generic Yugo, K-Mart and condom 
jokes," said comic Padon who has played The Improv and Comedy Isle. "It's 
getting more and more demanding to please the audience." 
</P>
<P>
"The audience has gotten a lot broader; you see all ages," Improv Manager Becky 
said. "They've gotten more sophisticated. They expect great shows. If you slip 
in an inferior show, they'll notice." 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes toward comedy have also changed since the '50s when comic Lenny Bruce 
shocked the world with his satire, comics, club owners and club goers say. 
Bruce, repeatedly arrested on obscenity charges, was known for his biting 
social commentary on bigotry, homosexuality and hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
Comics are dealing more freely with sex, and they're much more explicit, Dayna 
Miller of San Diego said while at the Comedy Isle for a show recently. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to today, even George Carlin seems laid back, Terri Snow of Mira Mesa 
said at a recent show at The Improv. "Carlin was raunchy in his day, but he's 
mild today." 
</P>
<P>
But "he's an old favorite, like an old shoe you don't want to get rid of yet." 
</P>
<P>
Today's shock comics such as Andrew Dice Clay draw mixed reviews from comics, 
club managers and club goers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Andrew Dice Clay is funny, but he's not that original or innovative," 
Duncan Fitzgerald of Del Mar said at a show at the Comedy Isle. "Richard Pryor 
is my all-time favorite." 
</P>
<P>
With his dirty, anti-female humor, "Andrew Dice Clay is kind of the mud bog 
comedian of the '90s," comic Padon said. But "I think Dice has very much 
calculated the size of his audience. He knows what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Clay says it is a character he's portraying on stage, comic Mark Brazill said. 
"I believe it is a character, but I believe you're responsible for what you 
create. If Spike Lee wrote a movie that says everything Clay says, everybody 
would be all over him. You have to at some point take responsibility. I have a 
problem with the female violence. That is what you ultimately have to be 
responsible for. People tend to identify and like that character. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much hate. There's just no comparison between him and Lenny Bruce. 
Bruce was making fun of the racist. He was attacking the racist. Dice is 
emulating the racist for laughs. It's a very dangerous character." 
</P>
<P>
Comedy Store Manager Fred Burns said he expects the trend carrying Clay to 
shift in a different direction toward more witty comedy. Also, most comedians 
are trying to convert their acts to television material, Comedy Isle's Randy 
Butler said. "You can't go on (Johnny) Carson and do sex and drug jokes. You'll 
never be on the show." 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to throw the "F" word around, and it's a lot harder to be clever," 
said Mrs. Hughes, adding that she prefers a clean and clever act. "Keeping it 
clean is the only way to make it in the media."

FLOATING CINEMA IS DUE TO DOCK IN 'FINEST CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Rubin, creator of Floating Cinema, confesses to getting a little mystical 
when talking about the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful place to experience things," he said. "Water at night is both 
magical and scary." 
</P>
<P>
Floating Cinema is the relatively simple concept of displaying films on the 
water, using a 30-foot screen and a rear projection system on a barge. It makes 
the venue part of the event, melding the images of the film with the 
picturesque setting. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of floating movies in New York, St. Paul, Minn., and New 
Orleans, Rubin is bringing the concept to San Diego, the first time it has been 
done in California, as part of America's Finest City Week. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, the 43-year-old chairman of the film department of the State University 
of New York at Purchase, has turned Floating Cinema into his own cottage 
industry. Although, at first glance, it is not the ideal setting to view a 
movie, he sees it as a different way to appreciate films. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the sterile environment of a screening room, Floating 
Cinema allows the audience to experience more 
</P>
<P>
than just a movie. There is also the romance of watching the film under the 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
"I like seeing the films reflecting on the water," Rubin said. "You're dealing 
with the film and the setting, the shadows on the water." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of Floating Cinema grew out of Rubin's frustrations as a filmmaker. 
Specializing in "somewhat unconventional" short films that focused on images 
instead of plots, he found it difficult to find places to display his works. 
</P>
<P>
Because his films were categorized as "experimental," his choice of venues was 
often limited to museums and galleries, which Rubin thought was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel my work was as esoteric as where it found itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He tried different things, including taking a mobile screen through the streets 
of Boston on a New Year's Eve, displaying images of summer in the dead of 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
The first version of Floating Cinema evolved from a class he taught in 1980 at 
Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass. The class was in optical printing, a 
special-effect technique. Rubin didn't want his students displaying their class 
projects, which were nothing more than images, in the same format as other 
students' feature-style films. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of a nearby pond, two rowboats were used to turn the projects 
into floating images. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the school jumped into the pond and it got kind of silly," Rubin said, 
but a concept was born. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by grants from several organizations, he and his compatriots built a 
giant screen on a small boat and traveled the waterways of Pennsylvania and 
Upstate New York. They would arrive at a campground unannounced, displaying 
their films and images for the startled campers. 
</P>
<P>
The spontaneity of the moment and the setting were as essential to the 
experience as the films, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most events are advertised and hyped and people go because it looks exciting," 
Rubin said. "What was exciting about this was that people were encountering it. 
It wasn't presented as higher art. They were just encountering it." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the rustic experience of spending six weeks traveling on boats, Rubin 
decided to scale the concept up, to attempt to bring it to a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
He soon discovered that many cities were looking for ways to improve their 
waterfronts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of the urban phenomenon of the '80s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He began attending meetings of Waterfront Center, a Washington, D.C.-based 
nonprofit group focusing on the problems of upgrading and developing 
waterfronts. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing going on at night on waterfronts, except for occasional 
fireworks displays," Rubin said. "There was no performance that fit." 
</P>
<P>
A festival in New Orleans was his first major gig, presenting the films on a 
barge in the Mississippi River. In 1988, Floating Cinema presented nine movies 
in New York; 22 the following year. This summer, Rubin will screen 27 films at 
12 different in New York's five boroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin was able to overcome several technical problems, primarily devising a 
system that makes the image bright enough to be seen from the shore. His rear 
projection system allows more detail in the image than the DiamondVision 
systems employed by stadiums, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The image has to be bright and clear," he said. "It's an illusory image 
competing with the real world. Trying to get the image to stand up against (the 
setting) can be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin also must deal with the elements. At first, he was using two small boats, 
which made it difficult to navigate the currents of the waterways he was using 
as venues. A sturdier barge solved those problems. 
</P>
<P>
He also developed a screen that could be easily raised and lowered, in case the 
winds grew stronger during a screening. 
</P>
<P>
"The little boat (used in early versions of Floating Cinema) was on the verge 
of turning into a sailboat" on at least one occasion, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Floating Cinema now takes up much of Rubin's time, he expects to 
return to filmmaking later this year. He will probably drop some of his 
academic duties to make more time. 
</P>
<P>
Although he realizes he has hit on a hot idea with Floating Cinema, it bothers 
Rubin that it may grow more popular, that it could be used for advertising 
purposes. But he takes comfort knowing that he may help films replace fireworks 
and laser shows as standard waterfront entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea that this can carry content, that it's not just a zapping 
light show," he said.

Dead Ahead: The Grateful Dead has canceled three scheduled Labor Day weekend 
shows at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., in the wake of 
the drug-related death of keyboard player Brent Mydland last month. 
</P>
<P>
The band will go ahead with East Coast shows in September, including a 
six-night stand at New York's Madison Square Garden, followed by a swing 
through Europe. The band's pal Bruce Hornsby will sit in with the Dead for the 
last five of the New York shows. Band publicist Dennis McNally said auditions 
are proceeding for a new full-time keyboardist who is expected to be on board 
before the East Coast tour starts. BETH KLEID

GUITARIST DAVID STAROBIN IN RECITAL AT CALTECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of guitarist David Starobin as an interpreter of contemporary music 
made his Wednesday evening recital at Caltech's Ramo Auditorium, Pasadena, an 
unexpected though pleasant surprise. In a program devoted entirely to the music 
of Fernando Sor and Mauro Giuliani, Starobin evidently made an attempt to 
rediscover his roots in late Classical repertory. 
</P>
<P>
His intelligent approach yielded commanding results, though the simplicity of 
the music was sometimes overpowered by his innate aggressiveness. Two 
diminutive guitars -- copies of instruments from the era -- brought a 
provocative dimension to the music while contrasting sharply with Starobin's 
large build. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the program, dedicated to Sor's music, romped playfully, 
though less tidily than ideal. A overly romanticized, but handsome reading of 
"Souveirs d'une soiree a Berlin" started off the evening, followed by five 
other shorter Sor works. 
</P>
<P>
Following an intermission, the Giuliani half explored a wider variety of moods 
and techniques. Among ten selections was a work described by Starobin as "the 
single most important 19th-Century guitar piece," the Variations, Opus 20. His 
reverent performance of the work convincingly revealed a sophisticated 
architecture of dynamics and articulations. GREGG WAGER

PALETTE CAFE: TORRANCE'S BURIED TREASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are still bargains around -- some of them are just buried. At the bottom 
of a Torrance mini-mall, past a furniture store and a Radio Shack and right 
next to a big bowling alley, you can unearth a little treasure called Palette 
Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The nondescript name belongs to a sophisticated Franco-Japanese restaurant. 
Inside it's a pretty-looking place, a bit larger than you'd expect from the 
plain exterior, and with the full Franco-Japanese ambience. There are paintings 
on the walls, a color scheme of black and white with pink accents, the whole 
precise and geometrical feeling. 
</P>
<P>
The printed menu, which looks at first glance like something from a lunch 
counter with handwritten additions, lists nothing but salmon, a chicken dish 
and a steak, augmented with pasta salads at lunch and a short changing list of 
appetizers and entrees at dinner. In the evening you have the choice of 
ordering a la carte or taking a prix fixe dinner (spelled "pre fixe") that 
includes soup or salad, appetizer, entree and dessert. Let's talk bargain. That 
dinner is $18.50, and there's even a reduced version without appetizer and 
dessert for $12.50. Top that at a Franco-Japanese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
You do have to persevere a little, because the appetizers are the least 
interesting part of the meal. The best I've had was "soft smoked salmon," 
smoked on the premises. Served over julienne daikon radish and sprinkled with 
onions and capers, it was indeed soft and had an elegantly mild smoke flavor. 
It was considerably more interesting than the rather plain marinated salmon, 
served on the same sort of radish bed but topped with a wisp of sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the appetizers are nothing to get entirely depressed about. A 
tomato and goat cheese salad is made with a thoroughly ripe peeled tomato; the 
melange salad is full of the fashionable lettuces. Once there was a very 
gentle, practically placid, scallop terrine. 
</P>
<P>
But the soups are either subtle as all get-out or just plain austere. I've had 
pumpkin soup with a faint but true pumpkin flavor, but the leek and potato is 
like half and half sprinkled with chives. The endive and walnut salad is 
positively severe: endive leaves, a couple of walnuts, chopped tomato, some 
slices of leek and apparently no dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The real reason to come is the entrees. One night there was a stunning roast 
lamb with tarragon tomato olive oil sauce. The plate was pretty to look at, as 
Franco-Japanese plates tend to be, but not in the usual cool, Zen manner. It 
was full of primary colors, naive and eager, like a Stuart Davis abstraction 
from the '30s.

The chunks of lamb rested on a coyly hidden bed of diced potato. Surrounding 
them was a pool of meaty sauce with an understated flavor of tarragon and olive 
oil, and spraying out in various directions were bright green long beans, 
cauliflower florets in a bit of cream sauce and some mounds of fried sweet 
peppers and onions. Next to the roasted whole garlic clove was an exquisite 
little luxury: half a dozen peeled, sweet, lightly poached fava beans. 
</P>
<P>
Another night there was beautiful grilled salmon resting on three long, skinny, 
partially peeled asparagus spears. Odds and ends of squashes, peppers and 
carrots were scattered around, and the sauce was a tarragon beurre blanc. I've 
also tried a very tender New York steak with a little bit of sherry sauce with 
a similar scattering of vegetables, and yellowtail dotted with a hash of sweet 
pepper and zucchini diced small -- one of the many quasi-ratatouilles floating 
around these days. 
</P>
<P>
The yellowtail was a tiny bit dry, and while another special of sweetbreads and 
chicken livers in white wine sauce was pleasant, the sweetbreads were not 
perfectly tender. Basically, though, at these prices you'd never complain. 
</P>
<P>
There are only about four desserts, but they include a wonderful espresso 
"cheesecake" with the exotically light texture of a mousse. A chocolate mousse 
cake, by contrast, actually has a cake texture, and it's plenty chocolatey. The 
characteristic pastry of this kitchen is a mixed fruit tart (say, blueberries 
and mangoes or blueberries and apricots) in tender yellow aspic. The apple pie, 
densely filled with apple slices and practically unsweetened, is for baked 
apple lovers, not apple pie lovers. 
</P>
<P>
The treasure hunt goes on, but as far as the corner of Hawthorne and Sepulveda 
is concerned, we've already struck pay dirt.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MOONRAKER FINDS PLACE IN THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cliche: Hotel food is boring food. But in the past few years, as 
experimentation has gradually replaced the old Continental glop, this has 
become less true. 
</P>
<P>
This new-style food isn't always good, but it's hardly dull. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the new Sheraton hotel in San Pedro opened Moonraker, a restaurant 
with a menu that is anything but safe. The chef, Larry Canas, comes with an 
impressive resume: He's cooked at Chez Melange in the South Bay, Le Bel Age and 
385 North. And he calls his food Asian nouvelle cuisine. That means there are 
things like duck livers served on soba noodles, Thai shrimp salad, and onion 
soup made with a reduction of sake -- Canas' pan-Asian 385 North training 
shows. He's fond of gimmicks like caper-shiso butter, and tropical fruit on 
just about anything, but it all beats staring down at another plate of trout 
amandine. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Moonraker is more ambitious than polished, but its weekend 
brunches have already become popular. Dinner entrees might run from $10.95 
specials to $22.50 for a veal chop grilled with foie gras and a Creole 
bordelaise sauce. 
</P>

CHEAP THRILLS IN A DIABOLIC REALM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1985, Dennis Oppenheim, a sculptor who played a central role in the 
conceptual art movement of the '70s, stopped producing work because he simply 
didn't feel like making any. Three years later, however, he dived back into the 
fray with a vengeance and began making art at a furious pace; the results of 
this recent two-year period of activity are on view at the Ace Gallery through 
Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The largest U.S. exhibition to date of Oppenheim's work (which is more widely 
known and appreciated in Europe), this ambitious museum-quality show is an 
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink installation of the sort associated with 
Jonathan Borofsky. A disorienting hodgepodge of seemingly unconnected 
information, the show (which includes sculpture, drawing, painting and 
photography) is essentially conceptualism shot through a surrealist filter, and 
non-sensical absurdities abound. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing the shrill wackiness of '60s pop like a not-too-convincing disguise, 
the show comports itself with an exaggerated sense of fun. Everything feels 
goofy and oversize and many of the pieces are kinetic -- heads spin, deer 
antlers shoot flames, a piano shaped like a pair of hands slowly claps. Giant 
domestic utensils -- salt and pepper shakers, toasters, a steam iron -- share 
quarters with glass bowls giving off clouds of steam, while oversized drums 
resonate with a steady boom. Noisy as a carnival midway, this is art with a 
Universal Tours sense of showmanship. There are lots of visual tricks and cheap 
thrills. 
</P>
<P>
Look closer, however, and you realize that what Oppenheim's saying isn't much 
fun at all. Inflatable cows appear to be devouring themselves, a helplessly 
drifting toy boat is caught in a swirling whirlpool in the hollow head of a 
statue, and a pair of motorized plastic heads spin wildly "Exorcist" style. 
Adjoining galleries house a pair of chairs that appear to be copulating, a toy 
train track is painted black and twisted into the shape of the number 8 million 
(an allusion to Jews killed in the Holocaust), and a piece titled "Badly Tuned 
Cow" involves a life-size plastic cow surrounded by fencing embellished with 
musical notes a la the Graceland gates. According to a gallery aide, this piece 
is a metaphor for the genetic engineering destroying the cow gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative effect of these tableaux is a feeling of hopelessness evocative 
of recent work by Bruce Nauman. Oppenheim implies that man is destined to keep 
crashing in the same car over and over, that he's doomed by biology to repeat 
the same activities ad infinitum. Breathing, eating, spinning in circles, 
copulating, fighting -- it goes on forever, pointlessly and at a frantic pace, 
and the collective weight of these behaviors is crushing. 
</P>
<P>
Of all these behaviors, aggression is clearly the king of the hill, and 
Oppenheim suggests it to be the dominant sensation of our time. In a tableau 
titled "Murder in Hawaiian Shirts," we see a pair of oversized resin shirts, 
one patterned with fish, the other with boats; on the floor between the shirts 
plastic fish and boats do battle. In Oppenheim's diabolic realm everything is 
in a state of hyper-animation as it either devours or is consumed. 
</P>
<P>
A Mixed Bag: In an adjoining gallery is a survey of recent work by David Amico. 
Along with Larry Pittman, Amico is one of the few L.A. artists in serious 
pursuit of the idea of Great Painting, and while achieving those lofty heights 
is clearly his goal with these very large canvases, he falls a bit short of the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Amico's work is absolutely correct -- a bit too correct in fact. 
He handles light, space, color and pictorial space like a master, but he seems 
to hold something of himself apart from his work -- it feels emotionally 
disengaged and cool in a way that seems unintended and out of sync with the 
larger ambitions of the work; in other words, the strategy of these paintings 
upstages everything else about them. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to operate on several levels, the paintings employ the motifs 
associated with music as a unifying theme. This is a perfectly fine system for 
Amico to structure his work around. However, it remains unclear exactly how 
Amico feels about music and what he sees as being its relationship to painting. 
With the reading he gives it here, it seems little more than an arbitrarily 
selected vocabulary of symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Though still a young artist (he's in his late 30s), Amico has already been 
through several incarnations as a painter and he tends to test out styles and 
discard them. He's worked through a figurative phase, a period heavily 
influenced by Robert Ryman, and a pop/cartoon phase. This body of work is his 
most mixed bag yet, and one detects the faint residue of all his past styles, 
plus traces of Arthur Dove, David Salle and Francesco Clemente. It all comes 
together rather smashingly -- these are very impressive paintings. Still, one 
comes away with the nagging feeling that at its very core, Amico's work is as 
yet a bit out of focus. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasure Principle: Also on view are paintings by Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe. Mostly 
monochromatic canvases exploring theories about pleasure and the sublime 
associated with Emanual Kant and Longinus, Gilbert-Rolfe's work is strikingly 
similar in appearance to that of Barnett Newman. Theoretically, however, 
Gilbert-Rolfe's work is an entirely different kettle of fish that combines the 
ideas of all the heavy-hitting French semioticians (Derrida, Lyotard and that 
crowd) with good old Sigmund Freud. Gilbert-Rolfe succeeds in wringing the 
juice out of all his influences in these extremely dry canvases.

LITTLE RUSSIA COULD PUT A BABUSHKA TO SHAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russians in Glendale? You bet your boots, boychick. Right here at Little 
Russia, we've got the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
The place has an ultra-authentic Russian look, like the sort of moody, 
neglected restaurant you'd find in a second-rank Moscow hotel. The dining room 
is large and boxy, crammed with maroon tablecloth-covered tables with matching 
maroon napkins standing straight up in the water glasses. There's a parquet 
stage for musicians and a dance floor just beyond it. Red neon lights give off 
a mournful glow. Tango, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
But first let's eat. Little Russia serves a combination of homey Russian and 
Armenian specialties that would make anybody's babushka go green with envy. I 
haven't had a single bad dish in this restaurant, and some were the equal of 
any I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Take the combo appetizers, a large, showy plate of exotic finger foods 
representing a variety of cultures. They include baklazhannaya ikra (literally, 
"eggplant caviar"), a piquant, grainy Russian eggplant dip; hummus from Syria; 
thin slices of a spiced Armenian beef called basturma, a sort of Caucasian 
carpaccio; and Turkish-style sarma, cold stuffed grape leaves with a 
meat-and-rice filling. There are also roasted eggplant slices, Russian pickled 
vegetables and huge hunks of Bulgarian feta. Every component is superb. 
</P>
<P>
Khinkali, boiled dumplings from Georgia (the Soviet one, that is) with a thick 
skin and a dense, garlicky filling of minced beef are about the most sensuously 
juicy dumplings found in any cuisine. Their intense fragrance borders on the 
overwhelming. Each is approximately the size of a baseball, and at six to an 
order, even Mischa the bear would have trouble finishing a plateful. 
</P>
<P>
About now you'll want to get up and dance your calories away. With luck, the 
musicians won't be playing one of those droopy-lidded Gypsy slow dances. 
Fortunately, they do perform some aerobic numbers. After a rousing rendition of 
Khatchaturian's "Sabre Dance," I could have sworn the musicians broke into a 
square dance tune along the lines of "Turkey in the Straw." 
</P>
<P>
Whether you decide to dance or not, the food keeps coming. The soup and salad 
course includes a refreshing Greek-style chopped number full of sweet onion, 
feta cheese, tomatoes and iceberg lettuce in a powerful wine vinegar dressing. 
The soups are peasanty. You can order either kharcho, an Armenian meat soup 
with vegetables, or borscht, which is particularly good, just loaded with 
cabbage and stewed meat. 
</P>
<P>
The entree plates -- mostly kebabs or chops, broiled with consummate skill -- 
are loaded too, with either a chicken-rich rice pilaf or a mixed vegetable stew 
of eggplant, carrot and potato. Shashlik Pokharski, thick lamb chops with 
garlic and parsley, are wonderful: tender, flavorsome and wonderfully spiced. 
Chicken tabaka is a flattened Cornish game hen, pressed on the grill to perfect 
crispness. The fish of the day one night was grilled swordfish, a man-sized 
chunk broiled with lemon and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a stickler for authenticity, there are some dishes -- beef stroganoff 
and chicken Kiev, to name two -- that you'd actually find served in those moody 
Moscow hotels . . . if you were lucky. 
</P>
<P>
A deep red glass of Georgian wine would suit this sort of food, but as yet 
Little Russia has no wine license. You'll have to content yourself with an 
imported Georgian mineral (and they do mean mineral) water called Borjomi -- 
alkali-heavy, even chalky, poured from a blue-green bottle. For many, Borjomi 
is an acquired taste. Myself, I like the stuff a lot better than Perrier. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, try the sticky, Armenian-style baklava, the cylindrical kind with 
a walnut filling and pistachios on top. There is also a second option, 
something the waiter referred to as a naplion. I think he meant Napoleon, but 
I'm still not sure. It was quite flaky, covered with shaved nuts and not 
particularly sweet. I liked it, and the name he gave it is just fine with me. 
</P>
<P>
Wash everything down with the muddy demitasse known in this region as Armenian 
coffee. Then get up and swing your partner, do-si-do . . . I mean, give your 
partner a soulful look and burn your face into her shoulder. They don't really 
square dance in Moscow, do they? 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: khinkali, $5; combo appetizers, $6.57; eggplant ikra, 
$2.82; shashlik Pokharski, $7.93; chicken tabaka, $6.57.

Warning to all participants in tomorrow's 1990 Los Angeles Citywide Senior 
Talent Show: No matter how good you are, you're going to get upstaged -- by 
something called the indomitable human spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing is they give 120%," said Meyer Bernfield, president of the 
Los Angeles Federation Council of Senior Clubs. "They do their bit, and some 
are really excellent. Some are mediocre, but no matter what, they do it with 
fervor, and they love it." 
</P>
<P>
All that fervor and 120%-effort will be on stage tomorrow beginning at 1 p.m. 
at Fairfax High School Auditorium, 7850 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, when senior 
finalists from all over the city sing, dance, tell jokes, act and play music 
for a panel of six judges. The event, sponsored by the city's Department of 
Recreation and Parks, will be co-hosted by Cesar Romero and Anne Jeffreys and 
emceed by Mario Machado. 
</P>
<P>
A number of these 60 indomitable human spirits will represent senior groups in 
the San Fernando Valley, and a few of them spent some time talking about what 
is certainly their greatest talent -- their ability to live active, full lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to dance the lambada sola! Meaning by myself," said Clarita Kern, 
who gives her age as "late 60s." 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. How can one dance the lambada -- the highly erotic forbidden 
dance -- sola? Isn't that something like playing one-handed strip poker? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I use the same steps," Kern said. "Of course, it's nicer because when 
you have a partner, it looks more -- oh, what's the right word for it -- well, 
suggestive." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't the point of the dance to be suggestive? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Kern said, laughing. "Well, it's still suggestive. I still use the same 
movements." 
</P>
<P>
Kern came to the United States from El Salvador 45 years ago, and taught dance 
for the Arthur Murray Studios in Portland, San Diego and Seattle. Married life 
slowed and eventually ended her dancing career in which she specialized in 
rumba, samba, bolero and that forbidden dance emeritus -- the once-dreaded 
tango. "My husband doesn't dance, so I put it aside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Living in Encino in recent years, Kern took up dance again after a visit to the 
Reseda Resource Center for Seniors. From there it was just a few steps, so to 
speak, to the lambada -- which she learned by watching dancers on television. 
Last year, she won first place in the talent show semifinals for a salsa dance, 
but was out of town during the finals. This year, she will compete. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandchildren? They get a big kick out of grandma doing the lambada! They 
are used to seeing me move. They can see my spirit and my enthusiasm. You just 
change when you dance." 
</P>
<P>
And you lose weight -- she says she's back to her teen-age level of 105. Does 
Clarita Kern recommend the lambada for other seniors? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes!" she said. "It's good for the waistline." 
</P>
<P>
With or without a partner? 
</P>
<P>
"Both. But oh, if they have a partner, it's better!" 
</P>
<P>
The members of Today's Golden Dreams range in age from 62 to 94. Some have to 
walk an hour to get to rehearsal -- instruments in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not professionals," Violetta McHenry said. "They are just students 
who never had a chance to sing or play music, and finally now they are getting 
a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Today's Golden Dreams is an orchestra of about 30 seniors who play instruments 
they have only begun to study in their senior years. For 16 years, McHenry has 
organized, taught and conducted the group at the Pacoima Senior Citizen Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful for their lives and very encouraging for them," said McHenry, a 
Mexico City-born musician who is decidedly not a senior -- she gives her age as 
"in my 30s." "Many of them have said they were very bitter and very depressed, 
and now they feel more fulfillment in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Refugio Zamora is one. The guitarist, 94, couldn't play a lick until he was 
about 84 and a beginning student in McHenry's class. 
</P>
<P>
Another is Lupe Gil, who, at 65, will sing "La Bamba" at tomorrow's contest. 
"She sings very wonderfully," McHenry said proudly. "She sings a solo, and 
that's one of the things she's wanted to do her whole life. In the beginning 
she was embarrassed. Now she does it so well." McHenry said Gil will sing "Amor 
y Lagrimas" ("Love and Tears"). "Also, Lupe is now learning guitar. She has 
been playing maracas and tambourine for 50 years, and about three months ago, 
she came with the guitar. It's so wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Sal Consolo, 67, will sing "Rags to Riches" in a hobo outfit at tomorrow's 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"There's joy in my heart every day," said Consolo, a retired North Hollywood 
postman who will represent Joslyn Senior Center in Burbank. "I sing in 
convalescent homes; I've been doing that for 30 to 40 years. I moved out here 
in 1946 with mom and pop, took care of them, never got married. . . . That's 
all I do now -- sing, and little acting." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps his hearty second-tenor voice in good repair, singing around the 
house, in hospitals, and acting with Serendipity Players, a senior drama group 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Does he expect to come in first tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
No, he said, "I'm looking to be part of a unit that will make a good show and 
show friendship among all of us and a little bit of love that we all need." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 years ago, at a Sisters of Mercy elementary school in the little 
Philippine town of Ilo Ilo, a little girl named Carmen Betita learned how to 
play a song called "Rosas y Perlas" ("Roses and Pearls") on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow at the talent show, that little girl -- now 78 -- will sit at the 
piano and play it again. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped playing piano when I was 19 because I was preparing for my high 
school graduation, and there was a competition for valedictorian," said Betita, 
who represents the Van Nuys Senior Citizen Center. "I wanted to compete for 
that position. If I continued playing piano, I would have no time for my books 
and grades, and I would not become valedictorian." 
</P>
<P>
Betita, who became a U.S. citizen in 1986, did indeed become class 
valedictorian, and her piano remained neglected for nearly half a century. A 
few years ago, while living with a friend who owned a piano, the Van Nuys woman 
sat down at the keyboard again and tried to remember. 
</P>
<P>
"And I started thinking about it little by little, and to remember -- little by 
little. Then I started remembering all those pieces I had learned when I was 
young. But without the books! I play everything by memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing 'Rosas y Perlas' and my friend said, 'Oh that is "First Waltz" 
by Durand.' I said, 'No, that is "Rosas y Perlas." ' She opened a book and 
showed me it was really called 'First Waltz.' 
</P>
<P>
The piece became her husband's favorite as well as her own. "I have a 
sentimental feeling for that piece because I learned it when I was 10 years 
old," she said. "Rosas y Perlas" -- uh, "First Waltz." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, that Sister of Mercy would be proud. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Bernard doesn't think he's funny. It's the things he says that are funny. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't call myself a funny comedian, I just tell things that are funny," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard hasn't always been a comic. In World War II, he flew P-40s in the 99th 
all-black fighter squadron, doing escort duty in North Africa and Sicily. 
Later, he flew supplies in and out of war-torn Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, 70, a Van Nuys resident who left his lifelong home of Harlem about 10 
years ago, retired as an air freight inspector nearly two years ago, but a 
sedentary life was far from his mind. A visit to a high school reunion that he 
said was "like going to a morgue" was additional impetus to "keep moving," as 
he puts it. Since retiring, he has written a novel titled "The Last Bus to 
Freedom," a political fantasy about Harlem becoming a separate nation, and has 
resurrected his stand-up routine (with appearances at the L.A. Cabaret).

Almost every afternoon for the past 28 years, Shelly Cohen has commuted from 
his Calabasas home to NBC Studios in Burbank. There, the assistant music 
director for "The Tonight Show" Band coordinates musical selections, chart 
arrangements and tempos alongside Doc Severinsen and Tommy Newsom. After a 
brief rehearsal, "The Tonight Show" Band is ready for its 5:15 p.m. taping. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's rehearsals with St. Mel Catholic Church Choir in Woodland Hills aren't 
so quick. The 100-member chorus, which consists mostly of amateur singers from 
14 to 80 years old, requires about 10 weeks of intensive practice to get ready 
for a major performance. But the experience is rewarding, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have to turn off a switch," Cohen said of his 18 years of directing the 
St. Mel Choir in comparison with his "Tonight Show" activities. "I need to take 
more time with them, have more patience. But this is emotional music. It's 
something with spiritually in it. When they sing 'You'll Never Walk Alone,' 
it'll raise the hair on your back." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight and Saturday, Cohen leads the St. Mel Choir, and is the guest conductor 
for the Los Angeles Pops Orchestra's final "Show Stoppers Summer '90" concert 
series at the Trillium Event Center in Woodland Hills. Both shows begin at 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The theme is "Broadway Treasures -- Curtain UP!" and includes the music of Cole 
Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Jule Styne, Stephen Sondheim, Leonard 
Bernstein, selections from "Phantom of the Opera" and a tribute to George M. 
Cohan. 
</P>
<P>
Originally a classically trained violinist, Cohen also mastered the saxophone 
and clarinet and earned his living as a studio musician on "The Tonight Show." 
Conducting was something "I just slowly fell into," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I watched and I learned. It's not just standing up there. It's 
working together as a family, changes in tempo by a look or a subtle arm 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
"He's transformed our choir," St. Mel pastor emeritus Msgr. Michael O'Connor 
said of Cohen. He added that the "Tonight Show" conductor has also used the 
church choir in two NBC Christmas specials, both of which Cohen produced. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 13th season, the Los Angeles Pops Orchestra has made the West Valley 
location its official summer home since 1986, said Victor Wong, general 
manager. Cohen has been a guest conductor for the orchestra once before, in 
1985, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen what he's done with the group, too," said Wong, referring to the St. 
Mel Choir's annual holiday extravaganza and television appearances. "He's an 
exceptional conductor." 
</P>
<P>
"Show Stoppers Summer '90" Los Angeles Pops Orchestra and the St. Mel Catholic 
Church Choir, with guest conductor Shelly Cohen, tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. 
in the Trillium Event Center, 6320 Canoga Ave., Woodland Hills. Stadium seating 
$15 to $20, table seating $35 to $50. Call (800) 233-7677. HEATHER W. MORGAN

AT THE GALLERIES: PAINTINGS LONG ON TEXTURE, SHORT ON VARIETY;

<P>
ART: ALVARO BLANCARTE'S COMPOSITIONS ARE TIRED AND FORMULAIC, AND HIS PALETTE 
TOO UNIFORM TO INSPIRE MUCH THOUGHT.

The paintings of Alvaro Blancarte have a lulling effect -- less from their 
placid beauty than from their numbing uniformity. The Tecate-based painter's 
current show at the Iturralde Gallery (7592 Fay Ave., through Sept. 2) is 
titled "En Mi Ventana" (Through My Window), and consists of heavily textured 
works on canvas, paper and board. 
</P>
<P>
Blancarte bases all of his work around a central motif of slightly undulating 
vertical lines, which often interrupt their course to bulge outward into 
knob-like protrusions. Occasionally, horizontals cross the verticals to form 
irregular grids. The format varies to include shadowy geometric shapes, as well 
as other, more concrete protrusions and a sporadic scribble. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's palette and composition don't vary enough to keep this viewer's 
gaze alert. From edge to edge of each canvas, Blancarte spreads the same 
mottled hues, all at the same middle range of intensity, neither pale enough to 
utter of ethereality nor sharp enough to cry of passion. Instead, they speak in 
unison in a cloying monotone. Dusty blue, soft mauve, lavender and the colors 
of sand, smoke and soot prevail, as do the many muddy tones in between. In 
isolation, or even smaller doses, Blancarte's colors could exude a delicate 
beauty, but here, applied with such evenhandedness, they are as moving as 
wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
If Blancarte's use of color seems less than fresh, his compositions, too, feel 
tired and formulaic. He sets the grid or grill of lines dead center in each 
image and surrounds it every time with layers of blocky brushwork and 
splattered color. 
</P>
<P>
There are passages of great movement and animation to be found, such as the 
frantic, tight grid work central to "Las Siete Colas del Perro 13" (The Seven 
Tails of the Dog 13). The lines, scratched with urgency into a thick crust of 
gray and mauve, fray at the edges -- a rare example here of tension and release 
amplifying each other. But further, beyond the stray lines of the grid, those 
same blocky brush strokes splattered with paint wrap the image in a neat 
package of predictability. 
</P>
<P>
Blancarte exercises his imagination most in creating his textures. Mixing sand 
and marble dust into his paint, he then sculpts the ribs and rivulets of his 
abstract images. "En el Fin del Tiempo" (At the End of Time) makes the most of 
the organic quality of the textures. Here, Blancarte's telltale lines have 
eroded, as if gnawed by wind and water to reveal a pocked and crusty underlying 
skin. In other works, too, irregular fissures and barnacle-like forms echo the 
composition of Earth's own surface. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most involving of Blancarte's images here, however, is one of the 
most shallow in texture. "Mi Ventana Negra" (My Black Window) pairs two 
canvases with dark, nearly impenetrable surfaces. An irregular grid has been 
scratched into the scarred, charred-looking paint, mostly black with highlights 
of white and glimpses of red and pale yellow. The two canvases are mounted, a 
few inches apart, on a common support. The space between them, painted bright 
blue, throws a decorative stripe into the otherwise cryptic work, breaking what 
is for Blancarte an all-too-rare mood of mystery and intensity.

4 KENTUCKY SHERIFFS ARRESTED AS FBI CLOSES DRUG-PROTECTION TRAP

<P>
The sheriffs of four counties in the eastern Kentucky hills were arrested 
Thursday on charges that they took money to provide protection for drug 
traffickers passing cocaine through the state. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI set up the sting operation last year with two agents acting as Chicago 
businessmen interested in shipping cocaine. At one point, cocaine packages were 
airdropped onto a farm owned by one of the officers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"What this particular situation does reflect is the absolute corrupting 
influence of drugs," said U.S. Atty. Louie DeFalaise. "As far as law 
enforcement officials . . . this is the largest case that we can recall." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriffs and two other officers were charged in a 42-count indictment that 
accused them of conspiracy, drug distribution and protecting other drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Forty FBI agents fanned out through the contiguous counties of Breathitt, Lee, 
Owsley and Wolfe to make the arrests Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Detained were Lee County Sheriff Johnny Mann, 39; Breathitt County Sheriff Dean 
Spencer, 46; Wolfe County Sheriff Lester Drake, 51; and Owsley County Sheriff 
Billy McIntosh, 57. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were Beattyville Police Chief Omer Noe and Wolfe County deputy 
Wilson Stone. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing before a federal magistrate, five of the men were released on 
bond. Mann was denied bond after an undercover agent testified he had promised 
during the yearlong sting to kill anyone who set him up. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, agents first met with Mann in Lee County. He 
allegedly introduced them to the other local law officers. 
</P>
<P>
From August, 1989, until this month, the agents paid officers more than 
$85,000. The money was in exchange for protecting the agents' fake cocaine and 
marijuana smuggling and distribution business from police detection and other 
interference, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
DeFalaise said the cocaine, which totaled almost 250 pounds, was never 
distributed for sale to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The initial conspiracy and extortion counts carry a maximum penalty of 20 years 
in prison and a $250,000 fine, or both. The drug counts carry a minimum prison 
term of 10 years to life and a fine of $4 million.

A drifter suspected of stealing up to $1 million from public telephone coin 
boxes in 32 states has been sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to 
repay Ohio Bell $802.50 in a plea bargain with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin County Judge Patrick McGrath sentenced James Clark to three 
consecutive one-year prison terms and to repay $802.50, little more than half 
of the more than $1,400 he is suspected of stealing from Columbus telephone 
booths. 
</P>
<P>
Clark pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of theft and two counts of 
tampering with a coin machine. Ten other counts of tampering were dismissed in 
the plea bargain.

SEABEES SENT TO MIDEAST AND TO GUAM; 
</P>
<P>
PORT HUENEME: BATTALION 4 HAS LEFT PUERTO RICO FOR SAUDI ARABIA. BATTALION 40 
IS IN ROTATION WITH ANOTHER UNIT.

One Port Hueneme-based Seabee battalion has left its post in Puerto Rico for 
Saudi Arabia and another battalion has been sent to Guam, possibly en route to 
the Middle East, according to Navy officials and family members of troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The Seabees have left Port Hueneme," said Port Hueneme spokeswoman Linda 
Wadley in confirming the departure of the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 
40. Battalion 4, which has been stationed in Puerto Rico, left for Saudi Arabia 
on Tuesday, said relatives of unit members. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Curtiss, which has been ordered to join the U.S. forces in the 
Arabian Sea, returned to its berth at Port Hueneme's deep-water harbor to 
repair a malfunctioning water pump that supplies the ship's boilers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was minor engineering problems with her boiler feed pump," said Marge 
Holtz, director of public affairs for the Navy's Military Sealift Command in 
Washington. "She is going to get underway on Friday." The Curtiss, designed to 
repair Marine Corps jets and helicopters, left without carrying any Seabees, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 650-member Seabee Battalion 40 were flown to Guam on Wednesday. 
Their departure was part of a scheduled rotation with another Seabee battalion 
that just returned from a seven-month tour in Rota, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw people muster, wearing their gear and being inspected and then, boom, 
they were gone," said Richard Flock, a utilities man second class at Port 
Hueneme. "It all happened very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Navy leaders have tried to keep secret all troop movements, leading to 
considerable confusion and concern on base about whether Battalion 40 will be 
leaving Guam for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't telling us anything," said Lyssa O'Boyle, whose husband is in Guam 
with Battalion 40. "We are all shook up," she said of herself and her five 
daughters. "Sitting here and not knowing what's going on is not cool." 
</P>
<P>
Dianna Penrose confessed that she worries about her husband, who left more than 
a week ago for Guam with Battalion 40's advance party. "We just pray for 
peace," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to sleep since the husbands left," said Margaret Kelly, 
another wife of a Battalion 40 Seabee. Kelly, the battalion's ombudswoman, 
assists other wives and family members left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion 4, which has been temporarily stationed in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto 
Rico, shipped out for Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, said Sol Caceres, the wife of a 
Battalion 4 Seabee. "I have some friends who are very upset because their 
husbands have left. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, my husband was not able to go to the Middle East," Caceres said. 
Navy officials recently called her husband back to Port Hueneme because Caceres 
had complications with her pregnancy and she needed help with her three 
children. "I'm lucky he is home right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme Chaplain Ken Rodes, a Catholic priest, acknowledged that it is a 
tense time for families of Seabees deployed overseas. "I would imagine if there 
was shooting over there, the tension would be worse," Rodes said. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes waiting is worse," he said. "Hopefully, everything will be 
resolved peacefully and everyone will be able to come home." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to turning to Port Hueneme's three chaplains, each battalion has 
support groups for Seabee wives, Rodes said. "We all pull together and do what 
we can." 
</P>
<P>
Marge Hayes said she is delighted that her Seabee husband returned this week 
from a seven-month tour in Rota. Until this week, his unit was the closest to 
the crisis in the Middle East that began when Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, whose father was also a Seabee, said she was concerned, but not worried 
about her husband's fate. "You can't let it get to you. Otherwise, every time 
he puts on a uniform, you'd be a basket case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
John Swank, a spokesman for the federal Maritime Administration in Washington, 
said the Curtiss was on a short sea trial and was supposed to return to Port 
Hueneme before steaming off for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Administration, an agency under the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, is in charge of maintaining the ship until it is needed by the 
Military Sealift Command. The Curtiss is run by a crew of 41 civilian mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some minor problems and repairs are under way," Swank said. "If the 
Military Sealift Command expects it will be ready Friday, that sounds 
reasonable to us."

L.A. OFFICIAL COULD FORCE HUGE TRACT TO SHRINK; 
</P>
<P>
AHMANSON RANCH: PLANNERS SAY COUNCILWOMAN JOY PICUS' EFFORT TO BLOCK THE 
EXTENSION OF VICTORY BOULEVARD INTO THE COUNTY COULD HAMPER THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Developers of the proposed Ahmanson Ranch project could be forced to reduce the 
size of the huge Ventura County development if Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Joy Picus succeeds in blocking the extension of Victory Boulevard, a planning 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Picus elaborated Thursday on plans to block a proposal by the Ahmanson Land Co. 
to extend the western end of Victory Boulevard into southeast Ventura County, 
where the 3,000-house development would be located on nearly 2,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The extension is a crucial element of the company's plans, which also include 
building 3 million square feet of commercial development, two golf courses and 
two hotels, said Dennis Hawkins, senior Ventura County planner in charge of the 
environmental impact report for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible they'd have to downsize the project" because the other four 
main access roads to the project probably could not handle the 70,000 trips per 
day the project is expected to generate, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
An Ahmanson Land Co. executive refused Thursday to speculate on the possible 
effect of Picus' action but acknowledged that a Victory Boulevard connection is 
very important to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Extending Victory Boulevard into the project "would provide us with the easiest 
and most logical access" to the west San Fernando Valley and offer 10,000 
motorists per day an east-west alternative route to the Ventura Freeway, 
Ahmanson Senior Project Manager 
</P>
<P>
Guy Gniadek said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gniadek said the effect of Picus' plan could not immediately be determined. 
"It has never been analyzed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gniadek also said he hoped that Picus would meet with Ahmanson officials to get 
a firsthand look at their plans for the project. "Her input on the project 
would be invaluable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus' opposition adds to the obstacles facing Ahmanson Ranch. The election 
last spring of a slow-growth candidate also leaves the project facing a 
possible hostile majority on the five-member Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the development proposal, Victory would link up with Las Virgenes Road, 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Crummer Canyon Road. Those three roads would loop 
northward into the Ahmanson Ranch project. Victory now dead-ends just west of 
Valley Circle Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, if Picus can block the Victory Boulevard extension, a 
1,000-page, $500,000 environmental study of the Ahmanson Ranch project -- which 
had been set for completion by early next month -- would have to be revised, 
Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus' strategy depends upon a 1-by-100-foot strip of land known as a "one-foot 
blocker," which resembles a narrow crosswalk near the end of the road. The 
blocker is a device by which the city retains control when developers want to 
link their projects to city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Until that ribbon of land, lying near the county line, is designated as a 
public street, Ahmanson can not link its roadway system to Victory Boulevard, 
Picus and city officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
"We could put up a barrier there if they tried" to build the road without city 
permission, said Linda Arnold, a Los Angeles city Bureau of Engineering 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The strip of land was reserved for use by the city in 1983 when the adjacent 
subdivision was approved by the City Council, said Stan Sysak, a senior Bureau 
of Engineering official. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to Ahmanson Land Co. to initiate the request that the land be 
designated as a public street. Assistant City Atty. Ed C. Dygert said Ahmanson 
could prompt the City Council to vote on its request. "But there's no way they 
can compel the city to accept the land as a public street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gniadek said Ahmanson's attorneys believe that their client already has 
authority under a deed to the land "to connect a road from Ahmanson Ranch to 
Victory Boulevard," Gniadek said. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it 'limbo land,' " Picus said of the 100-foot-long-by-1-foot-wide 
section of Victory Boulevard at a news conference Thursday at which, flanked by 
about 20 local homeowners, she made a second announcement of her plan. "I do 
not want this project to be a defeat for Victory Boulevard," the councilwoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only will there be a tremendous amount of traffic, it will increase smog 
around here until it's like a freeway," said Angela Herschel, a resident of 
West Hills, a neighborhood traversed by Victory Boulevard. "We'll work closely 
with Joy on this -- she's our only hope." 
</P>
<P>
With all the hurdles facing it, "there's no guarantee the project would be 
approved anyway," regardless of the outcome of Picus' efforts, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, about 3,000 acres of the 5,477-acre Ahmanson property 
would be dedicated to the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area. The remainder 
is now zoned as open space, a designation the developer is proposing to change 
through a General Plan amendment that would eventually come before the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors. Advocates of slow growth will hold a majority on 
the board in January when Maria VanderKolk takes office. Voters narrowly 
elected the environmental activist in June.

Members of two rival street gangs pummeled each other with fists, metal 
signposts and trash cans Thursday in the crowded lobby of the West Los Angeles 
Municipal Courthouse until law enforcement officers poured out of nearby 
courtrooms and broke up the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously hurt, but county Deputy Marshal Frank Gutierrez said he 
crashed through a plate glass window as he tried to separate two of the 
combatants. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them spun around and the momentum took us both through the window," 
Gutierrez said. They landed on the concrete patio outside and suffered minor 
cuts and bruises, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The melee broke out after members of the Venice Shoreline Crips and the Playboy 
Gangster Crips taunted each other while they were arraigned on various 
misdemeanor charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends from the spectator seats joined in as the fight escalated and spilled 
out into the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 gang members were involved, along with about 20 officers, including 
police, deputy marshals and sheriff's deputies, who waded into the brawl and 
broke it up within a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gang members tried to escape but were chased down outside, Deputy 
Marshal Bob Gibbs said. Ten were arrested on charges of fighting in a public 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective C. Harkness, an officer of the city's CRASH gang 
control unit, said it was not unusual for members of rival groups to be 
arraigned at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common that they bring their gang-member friends with them, and this time 
it just got a little out of hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both groups call themselves Crips, the Shoreline and Playboy Gangster 
groups have been "at war with each other for years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang members, all ages 18 to 22, were wearing distinctive shoes, pants and 
shirts. They knew each other from past altercations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"These people, when they see each other, they are going to fight," Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. Russ Kilby said. "They don't care where they are or who's watching. 
They're kind of foolish people."

L.A. REGISTERS A 11.4% DROP IN ITS WATER USAGE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: WHEN ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN POPULATION AND WEATHER, THE DECLINE 
FOR AUGUST IS 14.2%. THE REDUCTION FURTHER DIMS PROSPECTS FOR MAYOR BRADLEY'S 
MANDATORY RATIONING PLAN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Halfway through the critical month of August, Los Angeles residents are saving 
water in near-record amounts, pushing back the prospect of Mayor Tom Bradley's 
mandatory water rationing plan well into the fall. 
</P>
<P>
For the two weeks ending Aug. 15, city water users cut consumption by 11.4% 
compared to the same period a year ago, according to figures released Thursday 
by the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
When adjusted for changes in population and weather, the conservation figures 
soared to 14.2% -- the second-highest monthly figure this year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said there appears to be widespread public acceptance of water 
conservation, but they could not pinpoint specific reasons for the large 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
The conservation rate in August is of particular concern to city officials 
because its hot, dry weather typically leads to the heaviest water usage of the 
year. And, under a city ordinance adopted last month, mandatory rationing would 
be implemented if the adjusted conservation figure dips below 10% in August or 
any subsequent month. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not going to happen this month," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, 
who led the effort to halt rationing as long as residents voluntarily conserve 
water. "We gave people the opportunity to (conserve) on their own and they are 
responding." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who joined Flores in the vote to delay rationing, 
said "It validates . . . that the people of Los Angeles are capable of 
attaining ambitious conservation goals without being forced to" through a 
cumbersome and expensive rationing program. 
</P>
<P>
The mid-August figures represent a rebound in conservation from July. City 
residents had voluntarily reduced water use an estimated 9.8% in July, after 
hefty cuts of 17.5% in June, 11.7% in May and 12.3% in April, according to DWP 
figures for adjusted water conservation. Actual water use dropped by 5.8% in 
July, 8.4% in June, 9.1% in May and 15.7% in April. 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary saving persuaded City Council members last month to delay 
implementing mandatory water rationing, in favor of continuing the successful 
voluntary effort. 
</P>
<P>
If triggered, the rationing plan would limit all residents and businesses to 
90% of the water consumed in comparable periods of 1986 -- before the drought 
and the start of city-sponsored conservation efforts. Residents and businesses 
using more than their allotment would face surcharges for excessive water use. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way it could go below 10% this month," Flores said. "No way could 
we backslide that much." If conservation stays over 10% on an adjusted basis 
through the remainder of August, the earliest that rationing could be 
implemented would be October. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley, who favored implementing rationing months ago and has continued 
to press for its adoption, had warned that residents would backslide in their 
voluntary conservation efforts once the threat of rationing was no longer in 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement Thursday, Bradley said, "It seems the call to save 
water has been heard by many residents. I hope this continues." He credited 
much of the saving to "our continued emphasis on the need to conserve water and 
the release of daily statistics about water use." 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said they were not sure just how the water was being saved. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Derry, DWP director of customer service, who heads the conservation effort, 
said he suspects it is a combination of several programs, including a 
multimillion-dollar ad campaign and two dozen "drought busters" who cruise the 
city looking for excessive water use. 
</P>
<P>
Since May 14, the drought busters have handed out 3,500 citations for 
violations of the city drought ordinance, including hosing down driveways, not 
repairing leaks in a timely manner, watering lawns between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
and allowing water to run off into the street. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the drought busters have made 5,737 "informational" contacts, in 
which they deliver requested information on conservation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 20 PROTEST S. KOREAN ARRESTS OF ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 demonstrators picketed the Korean consul general's office in the 
Mid-Wilshire District Thursday, protesting the South Korean government's mass 
arrest of reunification activists this week. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Pan-Korean Conference Preparatory Committee of North America, 
who carried placards and marched at the consular office, called for a more 
lenient stance by South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, which would allow public 
participation in peace talks with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The group also chanted slogans demanding the release of political prisoners in 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came on the heels of protests in South Korea surrounding the 
August 15 anniversary of the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea. At the 
end of World War II, Allied forces defeated Japan and divided the country 
between capitalist South and communist North. No peace treaty has even been 
agreed on and the peninsula remains divided and heavily armed.

Two men firing from a passing car shot and killed a South-Central Los Angeles 
man early Thursday as he vainly tried to duck their bullets behind parked cars, 
police said. 
</P>

The victim, Donald Clark, 30, died in the street only steps away from a 
friend's house where he was going for a visit in the 500 block of 98th Street, 
said Lt. Larry Hinrichs of South Bureau Homicide. 
</P>

"He jumped between two parked cars, but got stuck and became an easier target," 
Hinrichs said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BONNER SWORN IN AS HEAD OF FEDERAL DRUG 
AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert C. Bonner, who was a federal judge and U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, on 
Thursday was sworn into office as head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Reminding those at the ceremony that the drug crisis has been building for more 
than 20 years, Bonner said, "It is going to take at least five years, and 
perhaps more, of steady effort and involvement by all segments of our society 
to work our way out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bonner took the oath of office from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia before 
about 300 people gathered at DEA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, 48, had been a U.S. district judge since June 16, 1989. Before that, he 
was the U.S. attorney for five years. He was assistant U.S. attorney in Los 
Angeles from 1971 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush nominated Bonner to succeed John C. Lawn, who retired in March 
after five years at the DEA's helm. The Senate approved the nomination by voice 
vote on July 27.

AN INARTISTIC THEFT;

<P>
LEAVING PART OF SCULPTURE BEHIND MAKES LOOT WORTHLESS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: 'THE WATER GODS,' THREE-PIECE WORK FROM A BEVERLY HILLS PARK, WAS 
APPRAISED AT $250,000. BUT DEALERS SAY THE STOLEN PIECES HAVE NO VALUE OF THEIR 
OWN. 
</P>

They pulled and twisted the statue of the girl, but it just wouldn't come 
loose. As a result, the thieves who stole two of three bronze figures at a 
Beverly Hills park this week now possess some impressive, but virtually 
worthless, art works. 
</P>
<P>
The three-piece sculpture, "The Water Gods," by the well-known Mexican sculptor 
Victor Salmones, was independently appraised recently at $250,000. But without 
the girl called "Rain," art dealers say, the stolen pieces depicting the boys 
"River" and "Sea" have no real value. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just sit and wait for awhile," said Babbs Shoemaker, director of the 
Victor Salmones gallery in Beverly Hills. "Maybe we'll find them in a dump or 
something. How else are they going to hide them?" 
</P>
<P>
The heist from Maltz Park on Sunset Boulevard has baffled police and puzzled 
art dealers. Beverly Hills police say the sculptures were probably removed from 
their pedestals sometime Saturday or Sunday night. The statues were discovered 
missing by a park official Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear exactly how the sculptures were taken from their bolted 
stands, which surround a water fountain in the small corner park, or how they 
were carted off. Police say each sculpture weighs at least 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The girl alone takes three men to lift," said Travis Hansson, vice president 
of the late artist's gallery on Wilshire Boulevard. "So I would guess there 
were at least that many involved." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Curtis said detectives don't know if the heist 
was the work of art thieves, but gallery officials doubted that it was an act 
of vandalism. Two other Salmones sculptures were stolen from public buildings 
in Texas during the last few years, but there appears to be no connection 
between the thefts except that the works were all on public display, gallery 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Salmones, whose bronze figures are in public buildings in 42 countries around 
the world, lent "The Water Gods" to the city before he died of cancer last 
year. Shoemaker said that in addition to the artworks "Force" in the UCLA 
Sculpture Garden and "Aquarius" at Metromedia Square in Hollywood, there are at 
least 50 Salmones pieces in collections in Southern California -- including 
that of Beverly Hills City Councilman Maxwell Salter. 
</P>
<P>
Salmones' associate, E. G. McGrath, flew in from Acapulco on Wednesday to 
assess the damage to the Maltz Park sculpture. The thieves broke part of the 
foot on the "Rain" statue and bent it at a sharp angle in their attempt to tear 
the piece from its metal bolt. 
</P>
<P>
"Either it was a random art theft or a collector may have commissioned the 
theft," McGrath said, "because whoever took it sure went to an awful lot of 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker said he is hopeful that when word of the theft gets out, the thieves 
will realize they made a mistake and return it. But police are skeptical the 
sculptures will turn up anywhere soon. 
</P>
<P>
"These sculptures are pretty distinctive," Curtis said. "I doubt if you'll see 
it in the Rose Bowl swap meet or anything like that."

POLICE CHASE, ARREST 3 IN ROLEX ROBBERY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE EXPENSIVE WATCH IS TAKEN FROM A SANTA MONICA CAR SALES MANAGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three men who police said robbed a Santa Monica used car sales manager of his 
expensive Rolex watch Thursday morning were run down and captured a short time 
later by a fleet of squad cars guided by a police helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The three were shadowed for about 10 miles on the Santa Monica Freeway before 
police converged on their car, rammed it and arrested them, said Santa Monica 
Police Sgt. Steve Brackett. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they were investigating whether the three were involved in some 
of the other 50 Rolex robberies that have occurred on Los Angeles' Westside in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Two men have been killed, including a nursery owner who was shot to death two 
weeks ago after refusing to turn over his Rolex, and as many as eight other 
victims have been injured in the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
"No single Rolex bandit or group of bandits is at work in the city," said Los 
Angeles Police Department Lt. Fred Nixon. "We're getting different descriptions 
of suspects and different weapons reported." 
</P>
<P>
The robbery left longtime car salesman Bob Gordon, who had quickly surrendered 
his expensive Rolex watch to the armed men, pondering what to do with the 
diamond-studded time piece when he gets it back. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that watch. It's a sign of my success," he said. "But I don't think I 
can wear it, certainly not to work. It's too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he was working on his second cup of coffee Thursday morning, "sort 
of planning the day," when he looked up at a pistol "pointed right at my 
heart." The man behind it was motioning at Gordon's $17,750 watch. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who has been wearing his Rolex to work at Len Sheridan Toyota for five 
years, groaned to himself "because I've been reading about the robberies and I 
promised my daughter I wasn't going to wear it so much anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful that other Rolex owners have been wounded or killed fighting to keep 
their watches, Gordon said he "right away unclasped the watch and held my arm 
out" to the gunman and an accomplice. He said the robbers grabbed the watch, 
herded Gordon and two of his salesmen into an office and fled. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Santa Monica police, responding to Gordon's call, "got a 
break" and spotted a car matching the suspects' vehicle speeding east on the 
Santa Monica Freeway, said Brackett. 
</P>
<P>
When the car exited at Crenshaw Boulevard, about 10 miles from the dealership, 
police converged in what house painter Phil Holmes, working on a commercial 
building just off the freeway, termed "the scariest thing I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said police cars "came out of everywhere. . . . They were shouting on 
the loudspeakers and (had) sirens going." Holmes said one of the suspects "got 
out and tried to run but he didn't get a hundred feet." 
</P>
<P>
Brackett identified the suspects as Eric Jones, 23, of Gardena; his brother, 
Derrick Darnell Jones, 20, also of Gardena, and Isaac Williams, 21, of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
They had a 9-millimeter pistol as well as a Rolex that Gordon identified as 
his. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are being held in Santa Monica jail in lieu of $25,000 bail each.

MUFFLER SHOP OWNER WANTS TORRANCE TO UP PURCHASE OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The offer from the city arrived one day last month when Walter J. (Jake) Egan 
was hard at work at the hydraulic racks outside Aable Muffler Shop, fitting a 
muffler into a car's underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is straightforward enough: The city wants to buy Egan's muffler shop 
and the land it sits on for $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city says plans to widen Torrance Boulevard would slash 18 feet off Egan's 
piece of land -- expanding the roadway to where the shop's hydraulic racks 
stand today. 
</P>
<P>
Egan bristles when he talks about the offer. His jaw stiffens behind his 
trademark gray beard. His voice rises with indignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't rush down to City Hall and accept a check, did I? I think the offer 
is ridiculous. Less than ridiculous," he said Tuesday during an interview at 
the muffler shop. 
</P>
<P>
Corner lots at busy intersections sell for millions, Egan contends. He says his 
land is worth at least $1.8 million. And he has a challenge for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"You find a corner on a main thoroughfare, with 46,800 cars a day going by it," 
Egan said with a flourish. "Find that corner, buy it for $78,000 -- and I'll 
move." 
</P>
<P>
But he's not ready to reject the offer outright -- at least, not in the 
newspapers. Jake Egan has become an expert at this dueling game. He's been 
fighting Torrance city officials on and off for seven years over this 
3,514-square-foot wedge of land where Torrance Boulevard meets Van Ness Avenue 
in the city's old downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The humble motif of Aable Muffler Shop -- its aging gray walls, oil-spotted 
pavement and jaunty red-and-blue painted trim -- is a startling accent amid the 
new redevelopment area much prized by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The shop squats at the edge of the landscaped expanse of the 101-acre, 
$225-million headquarters of American Honda Motor Co. Next month, employees 
will be moving into the sleek headquarters building, with its sea green-tinted 
windows that look out toward Aable Mufflers. 
</P>
<P>
Old Torrance collides with new Torrance at this intersection -- and that 
doesn't make city officials happy. 
</P>
<P>
The July 13 offer from the city opened the latest chapter in a long-running 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
It followed a Superior Court judge's April ruling that the city could begin 
condemnation proceedings against the shop. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Egan from City Manager LeRoy J. Jackson starts the condemnation 
process. The city had the muffler-shop property appraised, the letter states. 
"The offer is the full amount of the appraisal, and the city has determined 
this amount to be just compensation for the property," it says. 
</P>
<P>
An enclosed appraisal statement places the market value of the land, building 
and equipment at $78,000, but adds on "severance damages" of $8,900. 
</P>
<P>
The damages apply when the city takes part of a property and leaves a 
"non-economic portion," said Assistant City Atty. William G. Quale. In this 
case, Egan would be left with only 400 square feet after the condemnation, so 
the city would buy that piece as well, Quale said. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing will be convened in the next month on the city's taking public 
use of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Then the City Council will vote on whether the condemnation is necessary. If 
that passes, the city would file a case seeking eminent domain in Superior 
Court, Quale said. 
</P>
<P>
The city condemns property about once every three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The current offer is negotiable, said City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson. "Probably 
95% of the acquisitions we go through, we negotiate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Egan says he bought the muffler shop in 1970 for $25,000. He has been making 
$100-a-month payments and probably still owes about $3,400, he said this week. 
He says he does $287 in business a day at his shop. 
</P>
<P>
And he is suspicious about the city appraisal, he says. "I never seen no 
appraiser. I don't know who the appraiser is." 
</P>
<P>
But Quale counters: "We've hired an absolutely top-notch appraiser. This guy is 
not going to be off by a factor of 10 or 15." 
</P>
<P>
He gives little credence to Egan's own estimate of the property's worth. "$1.8 
million? There's no way," Quale said. "Based on the appraisal we have from the 
appraiser, I don't know how the city could justify paying that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
Even at $1 million, the property would be difficult to sell, said Richard 
Rizika, a retail specialist and sales associate at Coldwell Banker Commercial 
in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have no buyers at that price," Rizika said. On a per-foot basis, "the 
finest buildings in the South Bay would be in that range." He gave as examples 
well-placed properties on Sepulveda Boulevard in Manhattan Beach or Hawthorne 
Boulevard in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
As for the $87,000 city price, Rizika added, "there are buyers out there for 
properties at that price." 
</P>
<P>
A widely known figure in the old downtown, Egan is a former Carson councilman 
who spent nine months in federal prison for mail fraud and extortion in 
connection with the W. Patrick Moriarty political corruption case that rocked 
the state in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Egan's problems with the city of Torrance date from 1983, when the city tried 
to include his property in the Honda redevelopment project. After Egan sued, 
the Torrance City Council -- in its role as the city Redevelopment Agency -- 
agreed in 1984 to exempt his wedge-shaped piece of land from the project and 
even paid his legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Then, three years later, the city began work on plans to improve Torrance 
Boulevard, saying it needed 18 feet of Egan's property to straighten a curve. 
The 1984 agreement said only that the city would not take the property for 
redevelopment, and therefore it did not apply to road-widening, city officials 
said. A fraud lawsuit filed by Egan against the city is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Egan says, he owes his lawyer $21,000. But he insists he is far from 
surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says he is looking into the historical merits of his muffler 
shop, which he believes was first erected in 1936. He hypothesizes, 
half-flippantly: "Art Deco-style gas station, beautiful downtown Torrance. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
He suspects the condemnation has less to do with street improvements than his 
close proximity to Honda. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the city has anything against me. I think you have a city that's 
acting as an agent for a foreign investor," Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
A Honda spokesman says the company has no opinion in the condemnation debate. 
</P>
<P>
"That matter is strictly between the city and the muffler shop property and 
doesn't involve American Honda," said spokesman Robert Butorac. 
</P>
<P>
And Egan, standing outside his shop and gazing at the new headquarters, says he 
does not feel ill will toward Honda. 
</P>
<P>
"What does this represent? Compatible business," he said, motioning first at 
the Honda building and then at his shop. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't turn down a Honda. You bring in a Honda -- I'll fix it."

CHILD SURVIVES AS SHOTS PIERCE HOME;

<P>
VIOLENCE: 8-YEAR-OLD IS WOUNDED AS SHE SLEEPS. POLICE SEE NO MOTIVE FOR GUNFIRE 
IN SOUTH-CENTRAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

<P>
The blood has dried on the living room sofa where 8-year-old Jacqueline 
Aguilera was nearly killed by shots that suddenly slammed through the walls and 
door of her parents' South-Central Los Angeles apartment early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard shots and then her screams," the child's uncle, Franklin Vallecillo, 
24, said, pointing out four large holes in the front door and walls, from 
bullets shot by unseen assailants for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
"She was screaming, 'Daddy, what happened to me? What hit me?' " her father, 
David Aguilera, 28, said. "She was covered in blood." 
</P>
<P>
The long-haired child, whose dancing eyes and big grin shone from a large 
photograph on a wall of the East 54th Street apartment, had been seated on a 
red velvet sofa a few feet from the front door. She had fallen asleep watching 
television, her uncle and father said, when she was wounded in the cheek, arm 
and legs. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center said the child was 
in stable condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Dennis Scherr said the family, immigrants from 
Nicaragua, had no known gang affiliations and the shooting seemed to have 
occurred without motive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no witnesses," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been here four years, with no problems," Vallecillo said. "Nothing ever 
happened. Never." 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting started, Jacqueline's father, who is a construction worker, 
and 7-year-old brother, Dennis, were asleep in one bedroom and Vallecillo was 
asleep in another, he said. The child's 26-year-old mother, Savaluz, a postal 
worker, was at work. 
</P>
<P>
The shots rang out shortly after 12:30 a.m., Vallecillo said. When he ran to 
the living room, the uncle said he saw that Jacqueline had fallen from the sofa 
to the linoleum floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked her up and put her on a bed and tried to calm her until the 
paramedics came,." he said. 
</P>
<P>
The small three-bedroom apartment had been converted from the garage of a 
two-story apartment building. Thin wooden panels of garage doors make up most 
of the outer wall of the $400-a-month unit, which faces a back alley. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors contacted Thursday said they did not know the Aguilera family. 
</P>
<P>
Even though gangs are common to the area, "it's real quiet," Lupe Estrada, 58, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, another resident said a car "throwing bullets" drove through the block 
about half an hour before the shooting of the child. 
</P>
<P>
The building where the Aguileras live is a few doors from the location of the 
1974 police shootout with members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, when 
publishing heiress Patty Hearst was a fugitive.

WEEKENDER: WILMINGTON FIESTA 'HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 9 YEARS AND PEOPLE LOOK 
FORWARD TO IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS What: Wilmington Fiesta. When: Today, 4 to 10 p.m,; Saturday, 
Sunday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Where: Banning Park, 400 E. Pacific Coast Highway, 
Wilmington. Admission: $5; $1, children 11 and under. Information: 835-1751; 
549-0052.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wilmington is throwing itself a party this weekend, complete with carnival 
rides, mariachi music and food booths offering everything from homemade tamales 
to Thai delicacies and hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day Wilmington Fiesta begins today at 4 p.m. at Banning Park, 
culminating almost five months of work by more than 200 volunteers to organize 
and stage the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"The fiesta has been going on for nine years and people know about it and look 
forward to it," said co-chairman Ray Madrigal. "There's plenty of food and 
entertainment. People come to the fiesta and reacquaint themselves with old 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Though the fiesta -- Wilmington's biggest celebration -- is aimed at providing 
a weekend of fun, it has a serious purpose. It provides a means for more than 
20 community service organizations to raise funds for their programs and 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from being a nice get-together for the community, it gives an 
opportunity for a lot of us to make money for our organizations," said Connie 
Calderon, project director of the Wilmington Teen Center, which helps local 
youngsters -- some of them gang members -- through counseling, job 
opportunities and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which started the fiesta as a fund-raiser, is the main beneficiary, 
and Madrigal said he hopes up to $20,000 will come into its coffers this 
weekend, largely through the admission charge, booth rentals and beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
Other organizations bring in money through their booths, which offer games for 
kids and a large menu including Mexican carne asada and seafood, pizza, Chinese 
food and all-American hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making sure there's enough food," said John Mendez, also a fiesta 
co-chairman. "Last year, everyone ran out early on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
A host of business and community sponsors underwrites the $30,000 to $40,000 it 
costs to stage the fiesta so that money raised goes into community programs. 
</P>
<P>
Madrigal said many of the volunteers who help with the festival are people who 
participated in teen center activities when they were youngsters. Said 
Madrigal: "They benefited from the center and they want to help out wherever 
they can." 
</P>
<P>
A menudo cook-off has been a hit at every fair, and organizers say this year 
should be no exception. Cooking in colorful booths Saturday, 10 to 15 
contestants will create their own special versions of the traditional Mexican 
stew of tripe, hominy, onions, peppers and spices. 
</P>
<P>
Cooks are required to provide 10 servings for judging, but they always have 
enough left over for fiesta-goers to sample. Madrigal said the cooks always 
have their own special -- and secret -- ways with menudo, varying the 
ingredients and spices. 
</P>
<P>
"Some put in large pieces of meat and others don't," he said. "The spiciness of 
the soup really varies. Some are really hot and others are really bland." 
</P>
<P>
What pleases the palates of the judges on Saturday will be worth money for 
three of the cooks, with $500 going to the winner, $300 to the runner-up and 
$200 to the third-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
Singers, dancers and musicians will offer hours of entertainment Saturday and 
Sunday on two stages. Headlining the fiesta will be Yolanda del Rio, a Mexican 
singing star, and two mariachi groups -- Los Camperos and Sol de Mexico -- that 
perform with Linda Ronstadt and Vikki Carr. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said these are stars people would have to pay high prices to see in 
theaters or clubs. "Here," he said, "they see them for $5," the general 
admission price. 
</P>
<P>
The Latin jazz sound of Poncho Sanchez will be heard, along with the band 
Tierra, which specializes in Latin-flavored rock 'n' roll. Also on the bill 
will be an "oldies but goodies" show and an appearance by radio personality 
Humberto Luna -- billed as "the Mexican Rick Dees" -- who will emcee some of 
Sunday's show. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington's own Ballet Folklorico Raices will be on hand to perform Mexican 
regional dances. Dressed in colorful costumes with ribbons, lace, sequins and 
full skirts, the youthful dancers -- who range in age from 4 to 21 -- will have 
a repertoire including the famous Mexican hat dance, polkas from the northern 
Mexican ranch country and a light-hearted dance depicting jumping frogs. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet director Catherine Rodriguez said the dances are rooted in Mexico's 
culture and history, which she instills in the youngsters as she teaches them 
how to perform the dances. 
</P>
<P>
The audience at the fiesta also will get some of this lore along with 
entertainment. Said Rodriguez: "We give the history of the dances to the 
audience. A lot of people don't know about them." GERALD FARIS What: Wilmington 
Fiesta. When: Today, 4 to 10 p.m,; Saturday, Sunday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Where: 
Banning Park, 400 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Wilmington. Admission: $5; $1, 
children 11 and under. Information: 835-1751; 549-0052.

THE SCHLEVES AND READY MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I loved the letter from Leona Thomason (July 22) about Tom and Pat Schleve and 
Blue Star Ready Mix. 
</P>
<P>
It is about time someone spoke out against people who moved onto a street 
leading to a quarry and now are screaming their lungs out trying to get the 
quarry closed. It is my opinion that people who move next to quarries, 
airports, chicken ranches, freeways, dumps and other unaesthetic or unsavory 
places generally pay less for their property because of those very 
characteristics. To demand the closing of such establishments so that they may 
profit from increased land values at the expense of businesses and their 
employees is reprehensible and disgusting.

UPSET HELPS FUEL REHE'S COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After losing the first set and trailing Gabriela Sabatini, 4-1, in the second, 
Stephanie Rehe closed her eyes. She already could see the story line taking 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
"It was looking like, 'Rehe's coming back, but not quite,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
It proved a much different story Thursday at Manhattan Country Club, where Rehe 
almost lost, but not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Playing only her fourth match in 21 months, Rehe defeated Sabatini, the 
fifth-ranked player in the world, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, in the third round of the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just lucky today," said Rehe, who was not as fortunate in Chicago the 
night of Nov. 7, 1988, when the car in which she was riding was struck 
broadside by another car. 
</P>
<P>
Rehe required back surgery to remove bone spurs and parts of her lower lumbar 
disks. Until last week, she had not played since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Once ranked as high as No. 13, Rehe is ranked No. 44 in her comeback at 20. 
Some experts believed her career had ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I had several doctors' opinions, and very few gave me a chance to come back," 
said Rehe, who is suing King Tours, the owners of the tournament in Chicago 
that provided the car in which she was injured. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Rehe will accept her prize money from the person she is suing, at 
least indirectly. Jerry Diamond, promoter of the Manhattan Beach event, was 
part-owner of King Tours in 1988, and gave her a wild card into the Slims 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Rehe's suit seeks to recoup tennis earnings she lost while sidelined. Diamond 
said he believes Rehe had a chronic back condition before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever caused Rehe's back problems, she looked fit enough to Sabatini, who 
offered this assessment: "She play unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini was asked what she thought happened after she was leading, 4-1, in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"I just lost the set," she said. "I don't know how." 
</P>
<P>
Rehe's confident service returns helped a lot, as did her consistently deep 
groundstrokes that kept Sabatini on her heels. Sabatini seemed to think Rehe 
played over her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see all the matches she has," Sabatini said. "I don't know if 
she can do much better than she did today." 
</P>
<P>
Rehe's quarterfinal opponent will be sixth-seeded and ninth-ranked Mary Joe 
Fernandez, who won her third-round match against Laura Gildemeister, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova defeated Catarina Lindqvist, 6-1, 6-1, in 43 minutes under 
the lights and put up some pretty impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Projecting a semifinal against Zina Garrison, Navratilova is 48-1 against the 
trio of Lindqvist (13-0), Kathy Rinaldi (6-0) and Garrison (29-1). 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist won only 23 points in 14 games and won four points in the first five 
games against the top-seeded Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no chance at all," Lindqvist said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said her quick start was completely by design. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to mosey on down, I wanted to get out of the blocks fast," she 
said. "I just try to worry about what happens on my side of the net." 
</P>
<P>
Monica Seles complained about her timing being off, but she arrived in the 
quarterfinals on schedule with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Anne Smith, who was 
slowed after suffering a pulled leg muscle in the first game of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Seles will play Amy Frazier, a 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 winner over Nathalie Tauziat, in 
her third match in three days. It may be a busy week for Seles, who started 
play Wednesday night and could play five consecutive days if she gets to the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Next for Navratilova is 23-year-old Floridian Rinaldi, who is continuing a 
comeback of her own. Rinaldi burst upon the scene as a 14-year-old French Open 
quarterfinalist from Stuart, Fla., and was ranked No. 7 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching the third round of the 1987 French Open, Rinaldi was visiting 
Monte Carlo. She slipped on some stairs and suffered a broken right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Rinaldi hasn't been the same since. Her ranking slipped to No. 26, then to No. 
88. Now ranked No. 70, she defeated Jana Novotna in her third-round match, 3-6, 
6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Also reaching the quarterfinals were fourth-seeded Garrison and fifth-seeded 
Katerina Maleeva, who experienced the same degree of difficulty in setting up 
their meeting today. Garrison defeated Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer, 6-2, 6-0, and 
Maleeva beat Amanda Coetzer, 6-2, 6-0.

<P>
 All hunting has been banned in the state since the old Department of Fish and 
Game lost its last case in court in the early 1990s. When Cleveland Amory 
became the new director, his first move was to strike half of the department's 
title. His second was to fire all the biologists who advocated killing any 
wildlife species -- furry or feathered -- as a management tool. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no longer any game management. Without hunters to support it, there 
were no funds. So the creatures were left to themselves, as nature intended. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is no longer any game, because nature did not intend that freeways, 
housing tracts and industrial parks would be built the length and breadth of 
the state, devouring and subdividing the habitat and crippling the balance. 
Without help, the creatures couldn't cope and so died natural deaths, which was 
preferable to a slug from a .30.06. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no quarrel with this. The anti-hunters prevailed legally in court and 
at the polls, not by running around hunting sites in camouflage clothing, 
blowing airhorns and getting themselves arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The forests are silent. There are no tracks in the wilderness. The people got 
what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The future . . . or just a worst-case scenario? Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Item: Prop. 117 passes by a margin of 52% to 48%, outlawing the hunting of 
mountain lions in California forever. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Item: Sacramento Superior Court Judge Cecily Bond disallows this year's 
archery bear hunt proposed by the Fish and Game commission. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Item: Anti-hunting activists, on a roll, indicate that they will oppose the 
migratory bird and waterfowl seasons. 
</P>
<P>
There is only a whisper of protest about all of this. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Moose, the Sacramento lawyer who represents the Fund for Animals, which is 
leading the anti-hunting crusade, said: "We haven't lost a single hearing yet 
and, frankly, it's almost like shooting fish in a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Hunters, did you miss your wakeup call? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that they slept through it," said Wayne Pacelle, national 
director of the Fund for Animals. "Before the bear suit, the DFG had lost four 
lawsuits in a row and a proposition that was clearly in the public eye for a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
But while hunters slept, the DFG was fighting a lonely, losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
And if hunting interests are finally starting to stir, said author Cleveland 
Amory, who founded the Fund for Animals in 1967, "They're a little late. 
(Hunting of the) mountain lion's gone and (hunting of the) the bear's gone, and 
maybe by the time (hunters become organized), a lot of other things will be 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Loren Lutz of Pasadena, who has organized the California Wildlife Conservation 
Committee to fight the trend, said: "Anti-hunting hysteria is sweeping the 
North American continent." 
</P>
<P>
But the anti-hunting forces have picked their battleground carefully. It is 
California, a large, progressive state known for flouting tradition -- and a 
tiny percentage of hunters. The state's current population is 29,473,000. Only 
411,752, or 1.4%, bought hunting licenses in 1988-89, the last full season for 
which figures are available, and the numbers are declining steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Romero of Simi Valley, field representative of the National Rifle Assn. 
for Southern California and southern Nevada, said: "California is the 
battleground for all issues pertaining to firearms. The rest of the states are 
looking at us to see which direction we're going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Others think the NRA is partly responsible for letting the anti-hunting 
movement get this far by concentrating its powerful lobby on gun control issues 
rather than hunters' interests. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not doing the job they should do," Lutz said. "And Ducks Unlimited 
does nothing but sit around and wring their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Powell of San Marino, an archery hunting advocate, conceded that the NRA 
opposed Prop. 117, "but too little and too late." 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Evans, executive vice president of Quail Unlimited who is organizing a 
national pro-hunting movement, said: "Prop. 117 could have easily been 
defeated, but nobody was organized on the national level to fight it. We were 
in the NRA boardroom, and I was screaming at these people, 'Hey, if you guys 
had put $150,000 into this thing to battle it like you would one of your gun 
bills, we would have won.' 
</P>
<P>
"That is one of the key problems with the NRA today. They haven't been involved 
enough in the hunting issues. (But) they are a hunters' group, and you are 
going to see them heavily involved (now)." 
</P>
<P>
The issues run deeper than simple, clashing philosophies about the killing of 
birds and animals for sport. Under the California Environmental Quality Act, 
the Department of Fish and Game is required to submit scientific evidence that 
specific hunts will not harm the overall resource -- and such reports 
concerning bears, tule elk and mountain lions have been repeatedly rejected by 
the courts as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
But the DFG has gone a step further in pursuing the basic premise -- a myth, 
opponents call it -- that hunting is an important tool of game management, 
controlling populations within limited habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pacelle: "There are 10 times the number of species in California that are 
not hunted that are doing fine." 
</P>
<P>
And Amory added: "The 'management' of birds is a joke. It's a sport to kill as 
many birds as you can . . . (within legal) limits." 
</P>
<P>
The next critical date is Wednesday, when the Fish and Game Commission will 
meet in Sacramento to consider approval of the dove and band-tailed pigeon 
seasons that would open Sept. 1. Ordinarily a rubber-stamp procedure, approval 
this time would immediately trigger another challenge by the Fund for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 3, the court will consider the challenge against the regular, firearm 
bear season scheduled to open 10 days later. Again the case will be heard by 
Bond. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as optimistic as I was," said Terry Mansfield, assistant chief of the 
DFG's Wildlife Management Division. 
</P>
<P>
However, during the archery bear hearing Aug. 9, Bond commended the DFG for its 
documentation and said her decision will have no bearing on the firearm bear 
season, which will be considered on its own merits. Her main objection seemed 
to be with what she considered to be the inhumane method -- i.e., trying to 
kill a bear with a bow and arrow. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that more than half the bears shot were merely wounded and 
escaped to die a slow death or carried arrows around in their bodies for the 
rest of their lives. They submitted as evidence surveys done on hunting deer 
with bows in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Mansfield said archers have killed an average of 30 of the 1,245 bears taken 
the last nine years during which legal hunting was allowed in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"If the contention was that there's high wounding associated with archery 
hunting, why wouldn't we see it?" Mansfield said. "Instead, the judge 
apparently put more weight on information presented by the petitioners on 
wounding rates in Texas in archery hunting of white-tailed deer." 
</P>
<P>
For the archery bear case, the Fund for Animals brief alluded to the 1989 book, 
"The Bowhunting Alternative," by Adrian Benke, advocating the use of arrows 
treated with the tranquilizer succinylcholine chloride (SCC). 
</P>
<P>
Powell, the Southern California representative for bow hunter education, said: 
"It isn't any panacea. It's a hazard to you if you're messing with the stuff, 
and if you hit an animal, it doesn't cause an immediate, humane death. What it 
does is paralyze the breathing muscles, and the animal suffocates (without 
losing consciousness)." 
</P>
<P>
The use of so-called "poison arrows" is illegal under the Fish and Game Code. 
Earlier, the Fund for Animals urged repeal of that provision, then had second 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"(The poison arrow issue) was not a major thrust of the brief," Pacelle said. 
"We argued (instead) that under CEQA principles (the DFG) had an obligation to 
reveal all sides of the scientific issues involved with bow hunting, and that 
they had failed miserably to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"We provided about 20 documents which demonstrated that the crippling rate for 
bow-and-arrow use exceeded 50%. They didn't even include the discussion in 
(their) document." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said: "In places where detailed studies have been made -- (such as) 
military installations where they have a closed area and conduct hunts to keep 
the population to a reasonable number -- they've searched the area after the 
seasons, and there has been no evidence that the archery fatalities that aren't 
recovered are as much as (those from) firearms. 
</P>
<P>
"With an arrow, you have a smooth, clean cut, and if you don't cut a blood 
vessel, there's a good chance of healing. If you do cut a blood vessel, there's 
a very good chance of recovering the animal." 
</P>
<P>
So, where was that documentation Aug. 9? Clearly, hunters in general and bow 
hunters in particular are going to have to mobilize if they want to protect 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Amory said the Aug. 9 decision was a "landmark" case, adding: "We're the first 
to pinpoint the cruelties involved in the kind of game management today. I've 
never heard of a suit that addressed itself to the cruelty to the animal." 
</P>
<P>
Mansfield said: "Here's an indictment against one method of take. I think 
you're looking at a blanket challenge for archery hunting next year." 
</P>
<P>
Those opposed to hunting say the DFG documents share a common, major flaw: All 
are conceived with the purpose of justifying a hunt, not with an open mind as 
to whether a hunt is really a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Pacelle and Amory say their intent is not to outlaw all hunting in California 
and ultimately the country -- only what they call the most "egregious" forms, 
such as bow hunting and the use of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fund for Animals is against sport hunting -- all sport hunting," Pacelle 
said. "To outlaw all hunting at this point is not feasible. (But) I think the 
trends in California are clear. The hunters represent a small and diminishing 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Short of seeing an end to sport hunting, we'd like to see some responsible 
ecosystem management, and we're not seeing that from the California Department 
of Fish and Game. It continues to be controlled by a bunch of hook-and-bullet 
boys." 
</P>
<P>
As for a blanket attack on all hunting, Amory said: "I don't think that would 
win in the courts. We are going to make continued attacks on a sport that is 
represented by about 4% of the people of California. We are sick and tired of 
them calling the shots -- in all senses of the word. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need is a fish and game (body) that represents the vast 
majority of people . . . the non-hunter as well as the hunter." 
</P>
<P>
The Fund for Animals has 250,000 donors and paid office staffs in Sacramento, 
Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're fanatics," Amory said. "But we stick to our guns." 
</P>
<P>
That is what the hunters are up against. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA's Romero said: "It's not really fair to say we've forsaken hunting 
interests to go after the firearms issue, but the firearms issue came up a lot 
stronger and with more motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"And to tell you the truth, hunters by and large have been rather apathetic. As 
a sports group, they are the hardest to get on a bandwagon to become interested 
in those things that are going to affect them. Even now, a lot of them still 
think, well, they don't have to hunt bear or mountain lion, but there are still 
deer." 
</P>
<P>
Two other movements have sprung from the Antelope Valley -- one for each sex. 
David Whiteside, who owns a private pheasant ranch called the Antelope Valley 
Sportsman's Club, has organized the Shooting and Hunting Sports Legal Defense 
Fund, with a goal of raising $1,000 a day to fight the anti-hunting challenges 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside said: "We want to have those guys looking over their shoulders from 
all directions. If we don't stop 'em here, they aren't going to stop until 
hunting is stopped all across the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A splinter group is the California Sports Person's Legal Defense Fund, a 
women's group less oriented to hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to be with the gun-waving guys," said Whiteside, who 
nevertheless has agreed to serve on their board. 
</P>
<P>
Quail Unlimited's Evans said: "We've got to reach the hunter and wake him up. 
When we tell people what's going on in California, they say, 'Nahhh, that's not 
going to happen.' And I say, 'It just happened. You're on the threatened or 
endangered list right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Part of Evans' program is to organize an educational program to reach 
non-hunters "to tell them about wildlife management . . . where the money comes 
from for the programs we have been enjoying for so many years (and) to make the 
term hunter synonymous with conservationist. 
</P>
<P>
"If hunting were ever banned, we would lose hundreds of millions of dollars for 
other wildlife conservation programs. Wildlife would suffer a crushing blow." 
</P>
<P>
Pacelle disputes that notion. 
</P>
<P>
"The non-hunters are quite anxious to foot the bill," he said, "(through) a 
general form of funding for wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
Evans is also organizing a legal war chest supported by the hunting industry 
and publishers of hunting-oriented magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to reach our elected officials (and) judges. The point of the 
coalition is to say, 'We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it 
anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
One DFG official, who declined to be identified, is looking for help from those 
officials and judges, many of whom are known to favor duck hunting as a winter 
rite. 
</P>
<P>
Lutz, a leader in the pro-hunting Society for the Conservation of Bighorn 
Sheep, said: "The Department of Fish and Game is not getting enough help (and) 
is certainly not at fault in the bear situation, nor ducks or anything else. I 
don't think anything's been more studied in this state than ducks and black 
bears, except for bighorn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) the sportsmen sit by rather complacently and say, 'God will take care of 
it for me.' "

BRUINS SEEK END TO DEPRESSION; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: DONAHUE DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT WRONG IN 1989, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT 
IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1980s were like the Roaring '20s for Terry Donahue and his UCLA football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins set an NCAA record with seven consecutive bowl victories in the last 
decade. Moreover, the school's winning percentage of .720 ranked first in the 
Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the end of the '80s, like the stock market crash at the end of the 
'20s, the bottom inexplicably fell out of Donahue's previously efficient 
program. UCLA stumbled to 3-7-1, its first losing season since 1979 and worst 
record since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
As UCLA prepares for another season with practice opening Monday, Donahue tried 
to sort out the reasons for his team's puzzling collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us, either consciously or subconsciously, began to believe that 
you can inherit winning," Donahue said. "We had so much success in the decade 
of the 1980s and accomplished so many good things that you forget how you got 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to work to get there. Sometimes you think you're working, but you're 
not working as hard as you used to." 
</P>
<P>
There has been a significant turnover in Donahue's coaching staff since last 
season. He has five new assistant coaches, if Homer Smith, the offensive 
coordinator, can be included in this category. Smith had previous tours of duty 
with UCLA in 1972-73 and 1980-86. 
</P>
<P>
"I had people doing jobs for me who were in the wrong positions," Donahue said, 
reflecting on last year's staff. "They were good, competent people, but I 
didn't feel I did a good enough job with the right people doing the right jobs 
on the staff. That was a factor." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue cited other factors for the Bruins' decline into the second division of 
the conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
There were players -- including Willie Crawford, Roman Phifer and Damion Lyons 
-- who were suspended from school for off-the-field altercations that became 
police matters. A total of six players were involved in incidents that were 
embarrassing to the university and, possibly, affected the morale of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the players who got into trouble off the field upset the chemistry 
of the football team," Donahue said. "They were a distraction to our football 
team. We lost some kids, which undermined the depth of our team." 
</P>
<P>
Phifer, a first-team linebacker candidate, and Lyons, a cornerback, have been 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
"I also think we had some attitude problems on our team where players were more 
concerned with their own individual accomplishments and futures, as opposed to 
the team's accomplishments and future," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though one recruiting service rated UCLA's incoming freshmen in recent 
years as on a par with Notre Dame, Donahue says some of these players were 
over-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our recruiting classes weren't what they were publicized to be," he 
said, "particularly in the area of overall team speed. We didn't run as a 
football team anywhere near the way we had traditionally run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I failed to take into account the departure of players like Carnell 
Lake, Ken Norton and Chance Johnson, who can really run." 
</P>
<P>
As there is momentum in winning, the same could be said of losing. After being 
beaten by Michigan, 24-23, early last season in a game UCLA probably should 
have won, the team didn't go downhill immediately, but its confidence was 
eroding, according to Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost three games by one point and one game by three points," he said. "We 
could have won those games as easily as we lost them. Just as winning can 
become contagious, so can losing." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue, who is beginning his 15th season as UCLA's coach and is ranked sixth 
among the active winningest Division I-A coaches, is not passing the buck for 
the Bruins' dismal 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blaming anybody," he said. "I'm at the core of things. It's my program 
and I'm responsible for it." 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990s begin, Donahue seems fairly optimistic while aware of the pitfalls 
that lurk for any program, however successful in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In spring practice, he said, the team showed resolve to redeem itself from last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of genuine enthusiasm and excitement, and I think the 
injection of some coaches has been a positive factor," Donahue said. "Although 
the continuity factor of the staff isn't there, the quality is." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said his players enjoyed a productive summer in terms of physical 
conditioning, something that wasn't evident among some players he depended upon 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite UCLA's losing record in 1989, the Bruins have been ranked from first to 
fourth in the Pac-10 in preseason magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that winning isn't inherited, Donahue said: "I'm more cognizant of what 
our limitations are. I was more blinded by our success and didn't see some of 
the problems coming at us." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue called UCLA's schedule "murderous," with a Sept. 8 opener against 
Oklahoma at the Rose Bowl, followed by Stanford and Michigan (at Ann Arbor). 
The last three games are against Oregon and Washington, both on the road, and 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
A capsule look at the Bruins: 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE -- UCLA's secondary is intact, led by safeties Eric Turner and Matt 
Darby. The linebacking corps should be strengthened by the return of Phifer, 
who will join Roceen Keaton, Stacy Argo, Meech Shaw and Arnold Ale, a former 
starter at Notre Dame now eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue is concerned about his linemen, saying UCLA hasn't recruited well in 
that area in recent years. Brian Kelly is the only returnee who has started 
more than three games. Mike Chalenski, a transfer from Pittsburgh, could 
upgrade this inexperienced area. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE -- Donahue said he will name a starting quarterback fairly early into 
the practice sessions, choosing from among Bret Johnson, who started 11 games 
in 1989; Jim Bonds; redshirt freshman Tommy Maddox, and Bert Emanuel. 
</P>
<P>
Tailbacks Kevin Williams, Brian Brown and Shawn Wills shared the position in 
1989, and Donahue would prefer that one player emerges as the established 
starter. "The position has to produce and it hasn't," Donahue said. "Perhaps 
they haven't gotten proper blocking, or the offensive design didn't utilize 
their talents, or maybe they're not as good as they were heralded to be, or 
haven't shown the durability or toughness to be consistent in the league. Those 
are all possible reasons, and I'm darned to find the answer." 
</P>
<P>
The fullback prospects are Maury Toy, Kevin Smith and Kaleaph Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had four returning starters in the offensive line last year and, as 
a group, they did not perform to expectations. Now Donahue has only one 
returnee, center Lance Zeno, who was a full-time starter as a guard in 1989. 
"It's a concern, but I think (the line) will jell," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are seemingly set at wide receiver with the return of Reggie Moore 
and Scott Miller. Donahue conceded that he needs to develop depth at the 
position. UCLA is solid at tight end with Corwin Anthony and Randy Austin, 
making up for the departure of oft-injured Charles Arbuckle. 
</P>
<P>
KICKING GAME -- Donahue has to replace kicker Alfredo Velasco and punter Kirk 
Maggio.

SUIT FILED TO STYMIE VINCENT; 
</P>
<P>
STEINBRENNER CASE: INJUNCTION IS SOUGHT BY TWO MINORITY OWNERS OF YANKEES, 
INCLUDING OWNER'S LAWYER. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two minority owners of the New York Yankees, trying to keep George Steinbrenner 
in power, sued Commissioner Fay Vincent and investigator John Dowd Thursday and 
likened their investigation of the club owner to an "inquisition." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court by limited partners Daniel R. McCarthy 
and Harold M. Bowman, seeks to nullify Steinbrenner's July 30 agreement with 
Vincent by which Steinbrenner agreed to quit as managing general partner of the 
Yankees by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged "flagrant violation of Steinbrenner's fundamental rights" and 
"oppressive conduct by Dowd." It said "the procedures employed by Dowd in (his) 
interviews were unfair, unjust and resulted in a skewing of information." It 
also said "these depositions were conducted like an inquisition." 
</P>
<P>
The 62-page complaint is filled with many of the allegations made by 
Steinbrenner's lawyers in recent months. But Steinbrenner, in an attached Aug. 
6 letter to McCarthy, wrote: "I must tell you, Dan, that I am opposed to what 
you are proposing here . . . " 
</P>
<P>
When he agreed to Vincent's penalty, Steinbrenner said he would not challenge 
Vincent in court. 
</P>
<P>
"George has nothing to do with this," Steinbrenner spokesman Joe Carella said. 
"This is the partners." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy is Steinbrenner's tax and business lawyer. Bowman is president of 
National Utility Products of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, in a statement released in New York, said, "The allegations against 
Mr. Dowd and me are without merit and we are confident the matter will be 
disposed of by the court in Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Dowd's only comment was, "The matter is before a court." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, suspended from baseball for 15 months during 1974-76 for making 
illegal campaign contributions to President Nixon, had agreed to step down by 
Monday and give up control of the team he has run since Jan. 3, 1973. He also 
said he would reduce his interest in the team from about 55% to less than 50% 
by August of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent acted against Steinbrenner because of his association with gambler 
Howard Spira, and a $40,000 payment Steinbrenner made to Spira for information 
about Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and 
permanent injunction to prevent Vincent and Dowd from punishing Steinbrenner. A 
hearing on the restraining order request was scheduled for this morning in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit took baseball into the federal courts for the fourth time in 15 
years. Charles O. Finley, then-owner of the Oakland Athletics, unsuccessfully 
sued Commissioner Bowie Kuhn in 1976 and Ted Turner, owner of the Atlanta 
Braves, lost a suit against Kuhn in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose, then-manager of the Cincinnati Reds, sued Commissioner Bart Giamatti 
last year, but dropped the suit and agreed to a lifetime ban. 
</P>
<P>
The Steinbrenner case first was assigned to Judge George W. White, who declined 
it because he knows McCarthy. It was then given to Judge Alice M. Batchelder.

ABSENTEE VETERAN HAYNES IS RELEASED

Cornerback Mike Haynes, who failed to report to training camp because of a 
contract dispute, was released by the Raiders Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After asking the team to let him play a final season and move him to safety, 
Haynes was unable to agree to terms with the Raiders, who relinquished their 
rights to him. He is free to negotiate with any team. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get Mike in here, but there comes a time when you have to say 
goodby, and that time came," Coach Art Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
If Haynes' NFL career is indeed over, Raider owner Al Davis thinks the 
defensive back will be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a truly great player who made a tremendous contribution to the 
greatness of the Raiders," Davis said. "And we'll always appreciate him for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, 37, was one of the NFL's best defenders during the past 14 seasons, 
intercepting 46 passes. But Haynes became expendable because of his age and the 
Raiders' talented young corps of defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Raider cornerback Lionel Washington said Haynes taught him to play defensive 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was one of the best corners that played here," Washington said. "I 
learned a lot from Mike. He's going to be missed by a lot of players because he 
was an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders cut Haynes last season, then re-signed him after cutting his salary 
in half to $375,000. Used as a fifth defensive back in passing situations, 
Haynes played in 13 games, starting one. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a possibility that the Raiders would ask Haynes back this season if he 
does not sign with another team and their defensive backfield was depleted by 
injuries? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if we made the call, he'd be willing to come back," Shell said. "When 
I retired, I would have come back, but I'm glad they didn't need me because I 
was through." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes did not return calls to comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the first seven years of his career with the New England 
Patriots, Haynes joined the Raiders in mid-1983 and intercepted five passes in 
five regular-season games and three playoff games, including the Super Bowl. In 
1984, he intercepted six passes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Haynes was a great contributor to this football team; he helped us win a 
Super Bowl," Shell said. "He's a future Hall of Famer. He's one of the best 
defensive backs ever to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Displeased with practice Thursday, Coach Art Shell delivered a tirade. "We made 
too many mental errors," he said. "Sometimes those things happen, but we've got 
a game to play in two days and it's too late for those kinds of errors to be 
happening.". . . Shell said there has been no progress in negotiations with the 
Raiders' unsigned players -- quarterback Steve Beuerlein, defensive end Greg 
Townsend and safety Vann McElroy.

MAAS PLAYING IT BY THE NUMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: YANKEE ROOKIE HAS STEPPED IN FOR INJURED DON MATTINGLY AND REWRITTEN 
THE RECORD BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Kevin Maas signed the last baseball, finishing off a boxful, and moved aside as 
Steve Sax took his place at a table in the New York Yankee clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's he?" Sax said, tossing his head in Maas' direction, where a baseball 
card representative had intercepted him. "Yeah," Sax said, turning back to the 
baseballs, "Put the (guy) in the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
The razzing comes with the statistics. Kevin Maas, a 25-year-old rookie who has 
stepped in at first base for injured Don Mattingly, hit 10 home runs in his 
first 77 at-bats with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
No one in major league history had reached 10 homers more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Maas hit a homer July 4 in his 15th at-bat, off the Kansas City Royals' Bret 
Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
He hit homers in three consecutive games, July 23-25, against the Texas 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
He hit his 12th homer off the Seattle Mariners' Erik Hanson, becoming the 21st 
player to hit a ball into the Kingdome's upper deck, an estimated 448-foot 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
After 100 at-bats, he had 12 homers, tying a major league record. 
</P>
<P>
After 110, he had 13, another record. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in stretches like this before," Maas said. "They don't happen all 
the time, though. Not even once a year. It's not a fluke, put it that way." 
</P>
<P>
As he prepared for one of the Yankees' games against the Angels at Anaheim 
Stadium this week, Maas finished another piece of business and made his way to 
his stall, where a few reporters waited. Greg Cadaret, a Yankee pitcher whose 
stall was a few yards away, sniffed at the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"What did you do? You haven't even played yet." 
</P>
<P>
Maas laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of it," he said. "You take it in stride. I can turn one cheek with 
the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
Maas, a Cal graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering, is adding a bit 
of suspense to a season that has been unsuspenseful for the Yankees, at least 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
A left-handed hitter, Maas has a swing that is built for Yankee Stadium, where 
the right-field foul pole is only 310 feet from home plate, and right field is 
353 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of his homers have come at Yankee Stadium, one in every 7.4 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Maas was playing at double-A Albany in 1988, people were thinking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured Yankee Stadium was the perfect place for him," said Deron Johnson, 
the Angels' batting instructor who was then coaching at Albany. "He has a nice, 
short swing and real strong hands. . . . He worked real hard. He knew where he 
wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
Now, quickly it seems, he is there, and everyone wants a piece of him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty crazy," Maas said. "That's an understatement. . . . My days 
become very short. By the time I wake up to the time I go to bed, it seems like 
a couple of hours. I'm certainly trying to stay focused on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
After the series against the Angels, Maas is hitting .266 with 13 homers in 124 
at-bats, with a slugging percentage of .605. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether this is the beginning of a long career or the start of 
one that will be buried in the Baseball Encyclopedia, along with his name. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Maas has hit a homer every 9.5 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth hit one every 11.8 at-bats over the course of his career; Ted 
Williams one every 14.8; Willie Mays one every 16.5; Hank Aaron one every 16.3; 
Carl Yastrzemski one every 26.5. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-homer record was held by George Scott, who needed 79 at-bats with the 
Boston Red Sox in 1966 to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-homer record belonged to the Baltimore Orioles' Sam Horn, who needed 123 
at-bats to reach that mark in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mass is tied for most homers in a first 100 at-bats with the Texas Rangers' 
Dave Hostetler, who did it in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Some names and numbers flatter, some do not. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't build a career in a month and a half," Maas said. "You build it by 
doing it every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really trying to play down what I've done. I still feel I have to prove 
myself every day."

VAN SLYKE IS A TONIC FOR PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Van Slyke, cleared to play by team doctors shortly before the game, hit a 
home run in the ninth inning Thursday to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates past the 
Atlanta Braves, 4-3, in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, only the third for the Pirates in the past nine games, let 
Pittsburgh keep its half-game lead over the New York Mets in the National 
League East. 
</P>
<P>
Van Slyke, making his first start since suffering a badly sprained left ankle 
Aug. 5, gave the Pirates a 3-2 lead in the seventh with a run-scoring single 
against Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Van Slyke, who is 16 for 31 (.516) in his past nine starts, hit 
his 13th home run of the season against Kent Mercker (4-2), the Braves' third 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's Bob Kipper (5-1) worked a scoreless ninth and got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Cabrera's run-scoring double gave the Braves a 1-0 lead in the first 
inning against rookie starter Randy Tomlin. The Pirates got the run back on 
Jeff King's leadoff homer in the second. King went three for four and is 
hitting .329 in his last 18 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates turned infield singles by Bobby Bonilla and King, and Jose Lind's 
sacrifice fly, into a 2-1 lead in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Justice tied the score in the seventh with his third home run of the 
four-game series and 10th in 11 games. He has 20 runs batted in in his past 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta tied the score at 3-3 in the eighth against Stan Belinda after a 
leadoff double by Ernie Whitt. Lonnie Smith beat out an infield single and Jeff 
Treadway singled home Whitt. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, San Francisco 4 -- Von Hayes hit a two-run home run in the 
ninth inning at Philadelphia, handing the Giants their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes hit his 15th home run of the season against Mark Thurmond (2-3), giving 
the win to Roger McDowell (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Darren Daulton hit a two-run single to give Philadelphia a 4-2 lead in the 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Two walks by relief pitcher Dennis Cook helped the Giants tie the score, 4-4, 
on Will Clark's two-run single in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, St. Louis 2 -- Danny Darwin gave up four hits in six innings before 
being ejected after a fight with Pedro Guerrero as the Astros won for the third 
time in four games at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Darwin (8-1) won his sixth consecutive decision as a starter. He gave up one 
run, struck out three and walked none. Dave Smith went 1 1/3 innings for his 
20th save. 
</P>
<P>
Darwin and Guerrero had words after an inside pitch in the sixth, and Guerrero 
punched Darwin in the face at first base after the pitcher singled in the 
seventh. Houston Manager Art Howe also was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davidson and Franklin Stubbs homered for Houston and Rafael Ramirez 
doubled home a run off Joe Magrane (8-13). 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 3, Montreal 2 -- Joe Carter's run-scoring single capped a two-run 
rally in the 11th inning at San Diego to lead the Padres past the Expos, whose 
seven-game winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who have played the most extra-inning games (8-10) in the majors, 
beat the Padres, 5-3, in 17 innings Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Carter drove in the winning run with his fourth hit of the game. He hit his 
20th home run and doubled earlier, and leads the National League with 95 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Rodriguez (1-0) got the victory. Oil Can Boyd's streak of scoreless 
innings against the Padres ended at 23 2/3 when Carter homered in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 7, Minnesota 5 -- Sandy Alomar homered and Greg Swindell won for the 
seventh time in his past nine decisions as the Indians won at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Puckett, Minnesota's All-Star outfielder, played shortstop, third base 
and second base in the eighth inning. He moved from position-to-position 
between batters and did not get any balls in his first career infield 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to save my pinch-hitters," said Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly, 
referring to infielders Gary Gaetti and Kent Hrbek, who didn't start the game. 
"I was trying to get by for one inning so I'd be able to get my pinch-hitters 
in there in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 8, Detroit 4 -- Darryl Hamilton had four hits and scored three runs 
to lead the Brewers at Detroit. It was Milwaukee's eighth win in 10 games with 
the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder went four for four, including his major league-leading 37th home 
run for Detroit. He had two runs batted in, giving him 95, which tops the 
American League.

TENNIS ROUNDUP;

<P>
EVERNDEN CHIPS AWAY AT MCENROE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelly Evernden used a change-up serve to upset defending champion John McEnroe, 
6-2, 6-4, Thursday in the third round of the U.S. Hardcourts championship at 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
In another upset, 14th-seeded Richey Reneberg took advantage of third-seeded 
Aaron Krickstein's shaky serve, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Boris Becker and No. 2 Andre Agassi each needed tiebreakers to 
advance with straight-set victories. Becker beat No. 15 Kevin Curren, 7-6 
(7-4), 6-4, and Agassi struggled before defeating amateur Todd Martin, 7-6 
(7-3), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, ranked ninth in the world, lost his serve three times. 
</P>
<P>
"My serve put me in a whole in both sets. My game flows with my serve," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Evernden kept the fifth-seeded McEnroe off-balance with a confusing off-speed 
serve that had McEnroe standing still. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between playing John now and three or four years ago is that he 
doesn't have that aura of invincibility anymore," said Evernden, ranked 78th in 
the world. "He had this wall built up around him for a long time, but people 
have been chipping away at it for some time." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe took Evernden to deuce in the final game before Evernden hit a forehand 
that McEnroe watched sail by. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hot and cold, and today he was hot," McEnroe said. "But then I didn't do 
anything to make him cold either." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was hoping to use the U.S. Hardcourts to prepare for the U.S. Open 
beginning Aug. 27. Now, he's thinking of passing next week's event in Long 
Island to concentrate on the mental part of his game. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Gomez simply threw away his match with Christo van Rensburg in the Volvo 
International at New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez trailed, 5-4, in a third-set tiebreaker when he served into the net for a 
double fault. Then his racket broke when he slammed it to the court in 
frustration. Chair umpire Richard Kaufman, who warned Gomez earlier for a 
similar incident, penalized him a point, giving van Rensburg the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the rule," van Rensburg said. "Everyone knows that's the rule. That's 
why he didn't complain." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, of Ecuador, said that after more than 2 hours 40 minutes in the heat he 
couldn't help but get upset. 
</P>
<P>
"I just reacted," he said. "I think we should be allowed to show our emotions." 
</P>
<P>
According to the rule, a player may not "violently or with anger hit, kick or 
throw a racket or other equipment." 
</P>
<P>
"It's entirely the chair umpire's judgment on whether it was thrown violently 
or dangerously," tour supervisor Mark Darby said. 
</P>
<P>
An emotional player, Gomez said he was especially frustrated by his play 
against van Rensburg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when you're playing someone like Christo," Gomez said. "He's tough 
and makes you work and puts pressure on you." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, seeded second, said he was upset that he gave van Rensburg so many 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all the chances to win and he had only one or two. But he took advantage 
of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-seeded Jonas Svensson was upset by Mark Woodforde, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, fifth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov defeated No. 12 Jim Grabb, 7-6 
(7-4), 6-3; No. 11 Wally Masur beat Paul Chamberlin, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-3; Todd 
Woodbridge defeated Brad Pearce, 6-4, 6-4; Derrick Rostagno ousted Jim Pugh, 
6-2, 6-2; Bryan Shelton beat MaliVai Washington, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-1), and 
Cristiano Caratti of Italy outlasted No. 13 Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 5-7, 7-6 
(7-5), 6-3.

NEWSWIRE: ROSE GETS GOOD REPORTS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose is earning 11 cents an hour working in a prison machine shop and 
isn't playing for the inmates' softball team yet, the assistant warden said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, serving a five-month sentence at the Federal Work Camp in Marion, Ill., 
spends eight hours a day welding and fabricating metal with 70 other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"His work supervisor says he has been getting good reports; he gets in there 
and works just as hard as the rest of them," assistant warden Randy Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's all-time hit leader has also been watching the inmate softball 
teams, but hasn't been able to play because his knee is healing from surgery 
July 20, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Rose is treated like any other inmate -- doing basic chores eight 
hours a day and sharing a dormitory cubicle with another prisoner. Rose is 
scheduled to be released Jan. 7, then spend three months at a halfway house in 
Cincinnati.

DESIGNERS RESORT TO THE '60S; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: SILHOUETTES FOR THE 1991 SEASON RECALL FLOATING TRAPEZE, EMPIRE-WAIST 
DRESSES. EVEN UNITARDS ARE GIVEN A '60S FLAVOR BY WIDE, HIP-HUGGER BELTS.

<P>
Los Angeles women's wear designers are loosening up for the 1991 resort season. 
</P>
<P>
That much was apparent in fashion shows hosted last weekend by the California 
Mart, the wholesale shopping center in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a few skinny little suits, mummy-tight clothes are being edged out 
by swinging '60s-shaped ensembles. Trapeze, A-line and baby-doll shapes are in. 
Women who wax nostalgic for the decade might also welcome the return of dresses 
and suits with geometric graphics, Pucci-like prints or hippy flowers. 
</P>
<P>
More baby boomer reveries of their wonder years take the shape of teased 
hairdos. Chin-length bobs, long-haired flips and Audrey Hepburnesque, 
restrained beehives are back. So are false eyelashes, heavy eye liner and 
frosted pink lips. 
</P>
<P>
At several shows, silhouettes recalled floating trapeze and Empire-waist 
dresses; flyaway vests; short, James Bond trench coats, and Hugh Hefneresque 
pajama sets. Newer were the very '90s unitards and body suits given a '60s 
flavor by wide, hip-hugging belts. O-rings, plastic rings centered at the 
breast bone to anchor fabric, are also popping up. Designers Magia, Hot Lava 
and Saelee are among those using them for their cruise/resort wear. 
</P>
<P>
Flashes of bare skin, free of '60s-nostalgic tattoos, crop up everywhere. Upper 
arms are bare to the shoulder in every designer's collection. Halter tops, as 
well as circular and triangular cutouts across the bodice, are featured on 
jackets and tops. 
</P>
<P>
Hoda Meysami seems particularly fond of circular shapes. In her very '60s 
signature collection, Meysami appliques huge navy, brown and white polka dots 
on her trapeze dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Knitwear -- especially the Lycra/spandex fabric blends popular this summer -- 
takes a back seat to wovens, except for a smattering of Pucci-like prints shown 
by Hot Lava and Roberto Robledo. These look as if they've been lifted out of a 
"Laugh In" rerun. Linen, crepe, chiffon, cotton and other floating fabrics take 
on fluid shapes with Marie Antoinette-like fichu collars on jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most wearable looks in the new resort collections are the Audrey 
Hepburn-inspired dresses and suits. Sleeveless linen chemise styles that graze 
the knee round out almost every resort collection. Among the best are the wispy 
confections of Holly Sharp, who uses muted shades of butter, rose and mint. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Steffe, the only New York designer featured Sunday night at the 
Biltmore, also showcases chemises. Hers are less fitted and shorter (mid-thigh) 
than most other chemises shown but were fresh nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the newest revived look is the baby doll, worn as either a top over 
leggings or as a dress with bare legs and teamed with platform-heel shoes. The 
baby doll look is made of lingerie-sheer chiffon prints or more modest solids. 
Junior boutiques are already carrying baby doll tops this summer, but not 
everyone is sure the look is destined for a long life. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Klopmeyer, market representative for Directives West, a store buying 
service, calls it a "questionable trend at best." 
</P>
<P>
The retro tribute to a past decade also showcased relevant details. Dainty 
covered buttons, minimalist shapes with darts, "op art" printed scarves and 
hat-and-glove ensembles are just a few of the accessory must-haves for fashion 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
Small bags with straps short enough to swing flirtatiously are another 
must-have. Triple-strand pearls, slightly smaller than those worn by First Lady 
Barbara Bush, are an au courant extra. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, denim didn't make an appearance during the Mart's resort shows. 
Likewise, all but designer Roberto Robledo left bell bottoms inside the '60s 
time capsule. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these resort collections will be in stores by Thanksgiving. The term 
resort -- used interchangeably with "cruise" by swimwear companies and "spa" by 
New York's young spirited designer, Isaac Mizrahi -- once signified clothing 
created exclusively for winter vacations, purchased primarily by the jet set 
and sold out of stores long before most people even thought about their spring 
or summer wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
For some, resort will forever suggest the well-to-do. But lately, the clothes 
have become more directional, giving strong hints of where fashion is going for 
the spring-summer season that follows. 
</P>
<P>
What the models wore down the runway in last weekend's shows was far more 
fashion-forward than the once-predictable array of nautical looks associated 
with winter vacations in warm climates. 
</P>
<P>
Designers like Mizrahi say they use resort lines to flesh out concepts for 
future seasons. "Stores are not only able to tell what will sell during the 
spring, they will also be able to tell what their customer wants for summer," 
Klopmeyer says. "What they will find here are creative, individual designers 
who are not afraid to do their own thing." 
</P>
<P>
The most individual definition of the term "resort" comes from designer Tina 
Hagen. She sees it as a time of creative cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
"The season is a way to put the heaviness of fall behind you," says Hagen, "so 
you can concentrate on fun and the newness it will bring for spring."

AT THE BEACH, FANS IN A VOLLEYBALL STATE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL, QUINTANILLA TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huddled near a volleyball court at Manhattan Beach, Cara Klinger and 
girlfriends -- their aerobically conditioned frames sporting bright bikinis -- 
are oblivious to the preacher with the megaphone shouting "go home and cover 
your bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Klinger and friends are in a "UC state" (volleyball lingo for an unconscious or 
rapturous state), as they take in the sun, surf and scene of men's professional 
beach volleyball. Forget football, they say. Blow off basketball. For these 
women and the thousands of fans who attend the game played on a sand court, 
volleyball is king. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a spectator sport. It's a sport of spectators," says 
Klinger, 25, a Club Med account executive who has come to cheer her favorite 
players at the recent Off Shore Manhattan Beach Open. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like football or basketball where you sit in the stands for hours," 
says the Redondo Beach resident. "Out here you can walk around, sit in the 
sand, talk to guys, get a tan, swim, go back to the sidelines and watch the 
players," including stars like Sinjin Smith, Randy Stoklos, Karch Kiraly and 
Brent Frohoff. 
</P>
<P>
But people-watching may be the biggest "sideline" event at a volleyball 
tournament. Undeniably, hordes of hormones are at high tide as men watch the 
"Bettys" (volleyballspeak for women) some of whom wear a G-string bikini called 
a floss, and women, likewise, check out the guys. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, when the men's pro beach volleyball season started (four of the 20 
tournaments were in Southern California), fans have flocked to seaside nets 
from Venice to Seal Beach to see the action both on and off the court. And that 
action will peak the weekend of Aug. 25 and 26 when the 1990 Miller Lite USA 
Championship takes place at Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there's a game in town, I'm there," says Klinger, who adds that she 
plans to attend the Hermosa Beach event. "I love coming to the games because of 
all the people. It's nice being out at the beach on a hot summer day wearing a 
little something and meeting people -- you know, guys." 
</P>
<P>
Klinger and her best friend, Brenda Cooksey, 21, a Southwest Airlines ticket 
agent who lives in Hermosa Beach, admit they like attending the tournaments for 
the skin show, but say they have respect for the sport and the athletic prowess 
of the pros. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys are true athletes," Cooksey says. Among her favorite players are the 
team of Steve Timmons and Adam Johnson. "They play just as hard as the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
Talk like that pleases Jon Stevenson, president of the Assn. of Volleyball 
Professionals (AVP), which represents 330 men. Women players are represented by 
the Women's Professional Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit men's volleyball association was founded in 1983 when marketing 
gurus started to jump on the bandwagon to cash in on the players' popularity, 
says Sam Lagana, the association's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Lagana says that although the 1984 and 1988 Olympics bolstered interest in both 
indoor and beach volleyball, "The beach game had a very strong showing way 
before then. It became a pro sport in 1976 and had been around since the 1930s 
as a recreational activity." 
</P>
<P>
Today, a number of the men who played on the 1984 and 1988 Olympic teams are on 
the pro beach circuit, including Pat Powers, Timmons and Kiraly, who, with a 
partner, won two world beach championships before winning Olympic gold in 1984 
and '88. 
</P>
<P>
With more than $2 million in prize money for this year's AVP tour, men's pro 
beach volleyball is drawing increasing numbers of fans, Lagana says. 
</P>
<P>
The recent two-day tournament at Manhattan Beach pulled in 24,000 fans. A 
two-day event earlier this month at Seal Beach drew 27,000 people. And the 
showdown at Hermosa Beach, which officially closes the season, is expected to 
lure 40,000 folks. Five years ago, the Hermosa Beach tournament drew half that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
The players are making fewer appearances in Southern California this year (the 
1990 tour has taken them to 14 states, Japan, Brazil, France, Italy and 
Australia) and Lagana says that's why crowds are growing. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson adds that the sport also is garnering devotees because of players 
like Smith and Stoklos -- superstars -- who have given the game a higher level 
of glamour and respectability. Smith has modeled for GQ, for example; Stoklos 
appeared in the volleyball movie "Side Out." 
</P>
<P>
"The people who come out here love the beach, the lifestyle of the sport and 
they love the players. The fan turns on with the sport and the lifestyle. 
That's it. This is all part of the beach volleyball culture," says Stevenson, a 
top 10 player, speaking at the Seal Beach tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson says the exposure of beach volleyball via national TV (Prime Ticket 
Network, ESPN and NBC, which will televise the Hermosa Beach event on Sept. 1) 
and sponsors, who promote products at the free tournaments, also have created 
more followers. 
</P>
<P>
"Volleyball is my favorite sport. I'm here to watch the games. I'm not here to 
pick up a player," says Susan Meyer, 22, reclining on a beach chair at the 
Manhattan Beach tournament. Meyer is flanked by other volleyball fans Adrienne 
Pilmanis, Monique Figueroa and Barbara Lambkin, all dripping in dark tanning 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Says Figueroa, 22: "This is a really good time and plus I'm getting a tan." 
</P>
<P>
Chimes in Lambkin, 21: "And we're not bimbos out here. We're sports 
enthusiasts." 
</P>
<P>
At the Seal Beach tournament, David Argyle, 28, says he doesn't care what the 
women want to call themselves. Adds the Long Beach computer programmer: "(The 
women are) all babes. I'm just kicking back, man, grooving." And waiting for a 
bikini contest to commence. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, 20 scantily clad women, most of them "studying to be models," walk on the 
sand in high heels while making their way to an elevated stage before a sea of 
thousands of cheering men. The winner, 21-year-old Toni Ayabarreno, a junior at 
Long Beach State University, proves to live up to her title. She loves 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
And volleyball players say they appreciate their fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the fans," says Stoklos, 29, who has received flowers, letters and 
surprise visits by women while on tour and on his home turf. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes it can be scary," he says about the female fans who trail him 
home or to a hotel after a game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 33, says he likes the atmosphere of the sport more than anything -- from 
the serious fans to those who only come to see and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"We're outdoors, by the ocean, on the sand with a net, a ball and thousands of 
people. They make us stars and I respect them for that," he says. "I'd go out 
of my way for them." 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers Fred Hall and Ray Chen offer evidence that Smith and other players 
take time for fans. 
</P>
<P>
Tossing a fluorescent green volleyball between them on Seal Beach, the two show 
off its autographs: Smith, Stoklos, Stevenson, Timmons, Mike Dodd, Tim Hovland 
and others. Hall, 17, a senior at Cerritos High, and Chen, 16, a junior at 
Whitney High, began their autograph hunt at 10 a.m. Eighteen signatures later 
at 4:30 p.m., their star search is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe we got so many," says Hall about the autographs. "What a day, 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Adds his friend, Chen: "Yeah, and the girls weren't bad either." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SURF HAMBURGER? TEAM ADVIL? IT'S VOLLEYBALLSPEAK 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball players and fans, and beach-goers in general, have their own 
language. What follows is a rundown of volleyball slang. 
</P>
<P>
Bambi: A player who tenses up and does not play aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
Betty: A bikini-clad beach girl. 
</P>
<P>
Boom: A ball spiked straight down into the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck: A ball that is pushed or thrown, rather than hit. 
</P>
<P>
Facial: A spike to the face. Also known as a six-pack because volleyball 
etiquette holds that if you give another player a facial, you buy him or her a 
six-pack to help ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Flosser: A woman wearing a thong or G-string bikini. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Jed: A block. 
</P>
<P>
Juice head: A body builder at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kong: A one-handed block similar to the move King Kong performed on the 
biplanes in the original movie. 
</P>
<P>
Lip: A good dig. Gets its name from the lip-like appearance the arms create 
when they're placed together for a dig. 
</P>
<P>
Missile: A spike or serve that rockets out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Rock: A guy without the body for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Roof: An excellent block that ignites barking from the crowd, as in "Roof! 
Roof! Roof!" 
</P>
<P>
Spade: An ace serve. 
</P>
<P>
Stone: A woman without the body for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Surf hamburger: A swimmer who gets banged up in the undertow. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
UC State: An unconscious state where a player or team can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Volley Dolly: A female groupie. 
</P>

SURF CHIC; 
</P>
<P>
FOR FICKLE OP PRO CROWD, FASHION BECOMES ECLECTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

other active-sport magazines.

<TEXT>
<P>
Epic waves, surfing's elite and cash prizes totaling a hefty $90,000 were 
almost overshadowed at Huntington Beach by a massive crowd making an eclectic 
fashion statement during this summer's biggest surfing competition and beach 
bash, the OP Pro. 
</P>
<P>
Bandannas, baseball caps worn backward and lifeguard hats -- big-brim straws 
with fringed edges -- turned out to be the summer's newest trends in men's 
headgear. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber sandals that resemble leather huaraches, especially when worn with white 
athletic socks, also made a strong fashion impact at the four-day event, held 
during the last week of July. Puka shell necklaces were other leading looks. 
</P>
<P>
But all told, the fickle crowd had a tough time defining what exactly was hot 
and what was not. Case in point: Dozens of young women wore Rio-inspired, 
thong-style, almost-bare-backed swimsuits, unofficially referred to as the 
dental floss model. "The tan lines are the greatest," said 21-year-old Mariann 
Martin of Anaheim, pointing to her barely there black thong suit. A group of 
women a few feet away frowned and declared the suit distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
For the hard-core beach crowd, neon was the worst fashion faux pas. Craig Owens 
of Torrance, 16, in his all-black wet suit, said, "Forget flashy colors, I let 
my surfing do the talking." 
</P>
<P>
For men, long, silky blond hair and dreadlocks were the most fashionable 'dos. 
Derrick Taylor of Orange, 22, was the epitome of cool, wearing dreads, Lycra 
cycling pants over volley shorts, cyclists shoes and a tiny diamond earring. 
</P>
<P>
Pro snow-boarder Lee Johnson, 19, of Newport Beach, wore diamond-studded, 
cat's-eye sunglasses, a wild Bali-print headband he'd borrowed from his 
girlfriend, and baggy trunks. "Style? I didn't know I had one," he said.

ESTEE LAUDER COSMETICS GO HOLISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Is Estee Lauder getting hip? Or has America's queen of cosmetics and fragrance 
gone bonkers? 
</P>
<P>
With her newest company -- botanically based Origins -- launched last week at 
Nordstrom, 82-year-old Lauder is breaking beauty business rules. No fancy 
packaging. No fancy names or ingredients. In fact, Origins includes several 
products with non-cosmetic names and unexpected uses. 
</P>
<P>
Stress Buffer, for instance, is a gel designed to be rubbed on the kidney 
region and the solar plexus (just finding your solar plexus is a challenge for 
most people). Energy Boost, a blend of vetiver (a fragrant East Indian grass), 
cinnamon and lavender, is said to "keep nerves from knotting." There's even 
Peace of Mind, a natural headache reliever containing basil, rosemary and 
peppermint, to rub on the temples. 
</P>
<P>
The point, says Lauder's 30-year-old grandson, William -- who heads the new 
company -- is "a more holistic approach to looking your best -- beauty from the 
inside out." 
</P>
<P>
There's an environment-friendly message for every product. Recycling bins for 
used bottles, caps and boxes are positioned at every cosmetics counter that 
carries the line. A consumer dictionary is always on hand in stores to explain 
the uses of natural ingredients and essences like ylang ylang, myrtle and great 
mugwort -- herbs said to be natural relaxants. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying cosmetics line is more conventional, but all the colors are 
earth-toned. There's not a fuchsia lipstick or blue eye shadow in the lot. 
Another Origins touch is the pressed powder, embossed with a mantra: "One touch 
of nature makes the whole world kin." To that end, like many of today's 
cosmetics, nothing is safety-tested on animals. Origins goes one step further. 
None of the products contains ingredients derived from animals -- that means no 
lanolin, collagen or other animal proteins, and no fur brushes. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gubernick, the Lauder scientist who developed the collection, reasons, 
"From a scientific viewpoint, it doesn't really make any significant difference 
that we use no animal-derived ingredients, but it makes people feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Origins has its share of conventional skin-care products, but even they sound 
like they emerged from a '60s sensitivity seminar. These creams and lotions 
don't address oily, normal or dry skin, but rather skin that "acts" oily, dry, 
confused, sensitive or mature. The premise is that all skin is "normal" and can 
be troubled at times. 
</P>
<P>
The products are carried at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, but the West Coast 
launch was more significant, Leonard Lauder says. "People on the West Coast are 
far more environmentally aware than anywhere else in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Spikula, a shopper who lives in Santa Monica, was in Nordstrom at the 
Westside Pavilion on Sunday, sniffing the various Origins elixirs. She said the 
environmentally friendly approach didn't attract her, but the prices did. No 
Origins skin care product costs more than $25. "I'm going to buy this one 
called 'Peace of Mind' -- it's only $10," said Spikula. "If it works, that's a 
bargain."

Anita Baker continues to defy doomsday predictions with her very jazzy 
"Compositions" album. Some said her pop fans wouldn't like its jazz 
orientation, which would cut down on pop sales. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the album has been selling very well. It moved up a notch to No. 5 
on the Billboard magazine chart, without the aid of a hit pop single. 2 Live 
Crew's controversial rap album, "Banned in the U.S.A," is big in the U.S.A. -- 
bolting up to No. 21 in just three weeks. Hot new metal albums: Winger's "In 
the Heart of the Young" (No. 15) and Vixen's "Rev It up" (No. 54). Mariah 
Carey's "Vision of Love" is the No. 1 pop single for the fourth straight week. 
</P>
<P>
* Jon Bon Jovi entered the Billboard pop album chart in a blaze of glory, with 
"Blaze of Glory" -- the "Young Guns II" soundtrack -- opening up at No. 32.

LYNCH'S 'WILD' HAVING HARD TIME WITH U.S. FILM CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
REVIEWS: MANY FEEL THAT THE FORMULA THAT WORKED SO WELL IN 'BLUE VELVET' AND 
'TWIN PEAKS' IS LESS EFFECTIVE THIS TIME AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," which opens today nationwide, may have captured 
the imagination of Europe. But the winner of the top prize at this year's 
Cannes Film Festival is having a harder time winning over critics at home. 
</P>
<P>
A comedic road film about a duo (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) fending off a 
bunch of crazies en route from New Orleans to Texas, "Wild at Heart" features 
the director's trademark mix of subliminal sex, violence and out-and-out 
weirdness. Though few of the critics interviewed by The Times disputed Lynch's 
talent, there was a pervasive feeling that the formula that worked so well in 
"Eraserhead" (Lynch's cult classic), "Blue Velvet" (which put him on the map) 
and TV's "Twin Peaks" (which just landed 14 Emmy nominations) is less effective 
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynch works better with constraints like network standards and practices that 
require him to be sly and inventive," says David Denby of New York magazine. 
"Given complete freedom, he gives way to his obsessions. It becomes a 
procession of freaks which is now getting grotesque." 
</P>
<P>
In a review that ran last Sunday, The Times' Peter Rainer alluded to the same 
sort of heavy-handedness. "For Lynch, wickedness is, in visual terms, all 
goblins and demons," Rainer wrote, "and there's something peculiarly child-like 
and limiting about that vision." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Clark of USA Today believes that Lynch is falling back on old tricks 
rather than breaking new ground. "This film felt kind of 'microwave' to me," he 
says. 'Blue Velvet' was shocking -- saying something for the first time. This 
one was by the numbers . . . it left me cold." 
</P>
<P>
Though Time's Richard Corliss says he had a "great time watching the movie" he, 
too, perceives a change. "Lynch's 'style' is becoming 'mannerism,' but you 
really can't blame him," he says. "If you were on the fringe -- hanging by a 
thread -- and just received all those Emmy nominations, you'd become a 
corporation, too. In 'Twin Peaks,' he created the school of David Lynch and had 
a number of other directors shooting in his style. Lynch is essentially 
copyrighting weirdness." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Ebert gives the picture two-and-a-half stars out of a possible four in 
today's Chicago Sun-Times, reflecting "my disappointment in the film, but 
acknowledging Lynch's skill as a film maker," he told The Times. In his mind, 
"Wild at Heart" and "Twin Peaks" are "slices from the same sausage" -- flawed 
by the director's sensationalist approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynch is not unlike the Hearst press of the 1930s, which would titillate 
readers by running a three-part series on a whorehouse," Ebert says. "The 
reporter would take you upstairs and, then -- when his clothes are off -- make 
his excuses and leave. Lynch sticks you with all that violence and disgusting 
imagery . . . while he's standing in the corner saying it's all a joke. He 
diffuses everything with that layer of parody. He's a good director with a good 
visual eye . . . but he needs to find new toys to play with." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Robert Osborne of the Hollywood Reporter, who liked the film a 
lot. "It smarts to think that David Lynch who is so young and has such a short 
catalogue of films can already be accused of copying himself," he says. "John 
Ford always went for the same thing -- he had his style and we all applauded 
it. Why are applying a double standard with Lynch -- encouraging him to do his 
thing and coming down hard on him when he does? In a time of rather ordinary 
film makers, Lynch's wonderful, crazy mind is a breath of fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gold, who gave the movie a positive review in Variety, also rises to 
Lynch's defense. "I got a tremendous rush of adrenalin from the film," he says. 
"It's an American 'Heart of Darkness,' an all-out bombardment on the senses. 
Lynch's images are extraordinarily cinematic. Even when he's overreaching, he's 
mesmerizing. In a summer with a lot of headache-inducing films with gratuitous 
violence, Lynch uses violence lyrically to make a point. I liked this film 
better than anything he's done -- including 'Blue Velvet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek's David Ansen, another Lynch admirer, disagrees. "This film was silly 
. . . very cartoonish and campy," he says. "Things gross you out, but it's only 
fake-disturbing -- not up to Lynch's usual stuff. Still, it will have its fans. 
This will be the 'David Lynch movie' for people who don't like David Lynch."

ARTIST GIVING A FACE LIFT TO MURAL OF MEXICAN HERO; 
</P>
<P>
ART: WILLIE HERRON RACES TO RESTORE HIS IMAGE OF MIGUEL HIDALGO IN TIME FOR THE 
L.A. FESTIVAL. 
</P>

<P>
Something eerie and peculiar happened after Willie Herron painted Mexican 
Revolutionary leader Miguel Hidalgo on the facade of an East Los Angeles 
pharmacy 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Evoking the mystical realism of writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Herron described 
how "odd" that he unwittingly positioned the face of the "Father of Mexican 
Independence" directly over a weak area on the aging farmacia wall. 
</P>
<P>
Odd, he explained, because 18 months later, the face of the priest -- 
decapitated by Spanish soldiers -- fell off the mural wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before I began working, they had freshly plastered the whole building, 
but I wasn't aware there was substructure damage where I painted Hidalgo's 
face," said Herron, noting that over the years the mural remained stripped of 
its powerful focal countenance -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, Herron has been restoring "La Doliente de Hidalgo" (Hidalgo's 
Pain), a project he plans to complete Sept. 1, when the Los Angeles Festival 
opens. 
</P>
<P>
The work will be featured in its visual arts component after $3,000 for its 
restoration was contributed from the festival, $4,500 from "Neighborhood Pride: 
Great Walls Unlimited" (a mural program run by the Social and Public Arts 
Resource Center in Venice) and $3,000 from present owners of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"A huge part of the identity of Los Angeles, both as a community at large and 
within the art world, is the presense of these murals all over the city," 
festival director Peter Sellars said. "One of the most important artists in the 
whole mural movement is Willie." 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1976, the mural wraps around what is now a small market at City 
Terrace Drive and Miller Avenue in City Terrace. "It is a tribute to 'El Grito' 
(the scream), "the original cry for independence and liberty of the Mexican 
Indians against the rule of Spain," Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
A mighty, white-haired Hidalgo, said to have shouted the freedom demand on 
Sept. 15, 1810, after clanging the bells of a village church, is depicted with 
his mouth agape, waving a flaming torch beside a crowd of rebellious followers 
echoing his call for action. A stylized Spanish soldier with bayonets for arms 
hovers nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I used (David Alfaro) Siqueiros' mural of Hidalgo as a reference," said 
Herron, 38, who rose to prominence in the early 1970s with the "blood and guts 
and fists" style he uses to portray the barrio where he was raised and began 
drawing and painting. 
</P>
<P>
Just three years out of high school, Herron was commissioned to paint the mural 
by Luis Duarte, who bought the pharmacy across the street from Herron's home. 
Duarte wanted to name the building after the Mexican priest. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'It will be called "Farmacia Hidalgo" and I'd like you to do a 
mural about Hidalgo and the struggle of Mexico against Spain,' " said Herron, 
who was paid $900 for the job. "After a couple of years, the mural faded very 
fast because $900 for a wall that size doesn't pay for the best kind of paint." 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the work with a rainbow of durable acrylics isn't like painting by 
numbers. Some areas were so badly faded that restoration "verged on 
re-creation," he said, "because I had nothing to work with other than 
photographs that were taken right after the mural was completed." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti, the muralist's scourge, posed another challenge. Surprisingly, over 
the past 16 years, only 1% of the mural had been hit, said Herron, who has 
completed 14 other murals throughout Los Angeles, including one of 12 
commissioned in connection with the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The 160-foot-long artwork itself is still largely spray-paint free, but since 
the plastering and painting began, Herron said "local guys" have coated a 
three-foot-thick section of brick running along its base. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't mind. In 1988, the former co-founder of a '70s anti-Establishment 
performance collective named ASCO (Spanish for nausea) moved from the barrio to 
upscale Laguna Hills in Orange County. For most of 10 years, Herron had been 
working on graphic design in a commercial studio he co-owned, on interior 
murals for hotels and private homes and on paintings he's shown in Laguna Beach 
and San Diego galleries. 
</P>
<P>
But his feel for the grittier reality of his past, including the ability to 
cope in a community where he has sometimes had to dodge bullets between brush 
strokes, isn't lost. He plans to incorporate the graffiti into his mural rather 
than eradicate the urban iconography. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it's now been sort of resurrected or reawakened by its restoration, the 
mural has become a focal point in the community and (if) the local graffiti 
artists feel they need to put their 'John Hancock' on it so they can be noticed 
too, it's fine by me," Herron said. "Now I just have to figure out a creative 
way to make the two sort of marry each other."

WILL PERMIT FEES KILL ROCK FESTIVAL?; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERTS: PROMOTER PREDICTS 30,000 TO 60,000 A DAY WILL ATTEND. HE'S SOLD 7,000

Between 30,000 and 60,000 people per day will attend a three-day pop-rock 
festival over Labor Day weekend at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, 
the festival promoter predicted Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But a top county official said that promoter Michael Scafuto must pay more than 
$150,000 in overdue permit fees by next Friday if the Rock 'n' Roll's Main 
Event is to proceed. Scafuto denied that he is delinquent on permit fees and 
said the matter will be resolved by next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Sept. 1-3 affair -- featuring about 50 acts, ranging from rock "oldies" 
such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino to such contemporary artists as country 
singer Tanya Tucker and R&amp;B group Tony! Toni! Tone! -- would be the first 
major pop event at the San Bernardino site since the US Festivals in early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Scafuto, a Montclair nightclub owner who has been producing concerts and 
festivals in California for five years, said that he has invested more than 
$900,000 in the project since 1988 and that he estimates the production costs 
at an eventual $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the festival are slated to be broadcast live during the Muscular 
Dystrophy annual telethon to more than 200 stations nationwide. Steve Ackerson, 
regional director of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., says Scafuto has pledged 
$100,000 or 10% of the profits from the event to the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A permit for the three-day festival was approved by the San Bernardino County 
Board of Supervisors on June 24, but Supervisor Jon Mikels said this week that 
Scafuto still owes more than $150,000 in fees contracted to finance emergency 
services provided by various governmental agencies. The fees were originally 
due July 1, Mikels said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Hawthorne, chief of park operations for the San Bernardino Regional Parks 
Department, said Scafuto has been given an extension until next Friday on the 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has the option at that point to terminate the contract, but we're 
working with the promoter," Hawthorne said. "Its up to Mr. Scafuto to make the 
final decision as to what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
Scafuto said he has already spent more than $100,000 on an environmental-impact 
study required by the county. He said that he also agreed to pay $144,000 for 
use of the park plus pending permit fees, but complained that San Bernardino 
officials consistently inflated costs for security and additional services as 
the project proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
"When we made the original deal to put on this festival, nobody ever mentioned 
anything about all these other fees," Scafuto said. "I didn't realize I was 
going to have to pay for the entire county of San Bernardino to come to the 
party." 
</P>
<P>
Scafuto said more than 7,000 tickets had been sold through Thurdsay noon to the 
outdoor affair, which will also feature carnival rides and crafts booths. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, this is a major undertaking. It's not everyday that you get a 
chance to see this many kinds of American music on one stage at one time," 
Scafuto said. "We're trying to create something that has never been done 
before. We view this as a unique historical event."

HOLLYWOOD REDISCOVERS AN OLD MARKETING PLOY; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: BY NOT ALLOWING CRITICS TO SEE FILMS IN ADVANCE, STUDIOS WITH POTENTIAL 
CLUNKERS ON THEIR HANDS ARE ABLE TO PRACTICE DAMAGE CONTROL DURING THE 
ALL-IMPORTANT OPENING WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Has it come to the point where some movie studios stand to make more money by 
not showing their movies than by showing them? 
</P>
<P>
That just might be the case when it comes to screening films for critics. 
</P>
<P>
Three films from major distributors open today. Two of them, "Exorcist III" and 
"My Blue Heaven," side-stepped the traditional journey to the marquee: they 
were not made available for viewing ahead of time by critics. The third, 
Hollywood Pictures' comedy "Taking Care of Business," was screened in advance 
-- which means reviews of that film appear today in newspapers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the opinions of the assorted reviewers, "Taking Care of Business" 
may or may not benefit from early screenings. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the catch -- and the key to a clever marketing ploy: By not 
allowing critics to see movies in advance, studios with potential clunkers on 
their hands are able to practice damage control during the all-important 
opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic was put to effective use earlier this summer with "Problem Child." 
Produced by Imagine Entertainment, and distributed by Universal Pictures, the 
comedy about a nightmarish 7-year-old was the first major film of the season 
that wasn't screened early for critics. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of industry analysts, the film had opening weekend ticket sales 
of $10 million -- ranking third for the weekend, after "Presumed Innocent" and 
"Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Most critics didn't get to take their whacks until the following week. Though 
they virtually ganged up on the movie -- which Daily Variety dubbed "a serious 
contender for the worst release of the year by a major distributor" -- it was 
by then being heralded in ad copy as "America's No. 1 Comedy!" 
</P>
<P>
The film has managed to continue its momentum, grossing $31 million in three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Pictures declined to discuss its "Problem Child" marketing tactics. 
But it's clear that keeping the film from the critics didn't hurt it at the box 
office. And the opening weekend marketing campaigns for "Exorcist III" and "My 
Blue Heaven" are following in its path. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to try and cover your bases, and cover your flanks as much as you 
can. So you go for your target audience," explained Gordon Armstrong, marketing 
president for Morgan Creek Productions. Morgan Creek produced "Exorcist III," 
which 20th Century Fox is distributing. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Armstrong added, that target audience is 25 and younger. "So I 
don't know that reviews are really that important to a film's success," he 
said. "It's a tragic commentary, but our young people do not really read 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study entitled "The Age of Indifference," sponsored by the Times 
Mirror Co., parent of The Times, found that Americans 18 to 30 are today far 
less likely to read a newspaper than their counterparts were a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Morgan Creek's Billy the Kid saga "Young Guns II" -- which got 
mixed reviews and has earned $21.2 million in two weeks -- Armstrong mused, "I 
don't know that it was even necessary for us to have screened that movie (in 
advance). Because I don't think our target audience bothered to read the 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"They responded to the film's young stars (a roster of young male heartthrobs), 
and the subject material and word-of-mouth. And even, I think, to the strong 
musical score by (rock star) Jon Bon Jovi." 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to what has been a highly-competitive summer, dominated by 
high-profile titles, he said: "We want the market to be as clear as it can. 
What we did was our prerogative. This is nothing new, you know. Studios have 
done it for years." 
</P>
<P>
Added Armstrong: "Why contaminate the marketplace with reviews that might not 
be good? Why not let the public decide whether they enjoy a movie or not?" 
</P>
<P>
Keeping movies under wraps -- away from potential critical barbs during the 
all-important opening weekend -- is, indeed, a longtime industry tactic, 
especially when a studio smells a stinker. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, troubled Orion Pictures released a succession of titles -- 
"Everybody Wins," "Madhouse," "The Last of the Finest" and "The First Power" -- 
without advance screenings. Of the quartet, the comedy, "Madhouse," and the 
supernatural thriller, "The First Power," each had opening weekend ticket sales 
of more than $5 million. Both films went on to outrun the decidedly negative 
reviews that followed to gross more than $20 million. ("Everybody Wins" and 
"Last of the Finest" were not so lucky: each grossed less than $2 million.) 
</P>
<P>
As Orion learned, plenty of opening weekend tickets can be sold with exhaustive 
TV advertising campaigns and trailers of coming attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Spots for "My Blue Heaven" have been running on TV for several weeks; the 
trailers have been in theaters for months. Directed by Herb Ross from a script 
by Nora Ephron, clips depict Steve Martin as a mob informant who moves to 
suburbia under a witness relocation program, where he's under the watchful eye 
of federal agent Rick Moranis. 
</P>
<P>
Both Martin and Moranis did interviews to promote the film at a junket held for 
feature writers. Warner Bros. declined to comment on "My Blue Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
But William Peter Blatty, the writer-director of "Exorcist III," is boiling 
over the decision to keep his movie under wraps. "I guess the thinking is, 'If 
it's a good review, it won't really help. And if it's a bad review it might 
hurt.' That kind of thinking fills me with consternation," said Blatty, who 
also wrote and produced the original film based on his best-selling novel. "It 
beats the hell out of me why they would make this kind of decision. I guess 
they're just afraid of upsetting the apple cart." 
</P>
<P>
The second sequel to the 1973 landmark shocker (the first was the notorious 
1977 bomb, "The Exorcist II: The Heretic"), "Exorcist III," stars George C. 
Scott (in the role played by the late Lee J. Cobb in the original film), Jason 
Miller (returning as Father Damien Karras) and, as new characters, Nicol 
Williamson and Brad Dourif. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a slasher picture, it's a psychological thriller -- a supernatural 
detective story," said Blatty, who believes that the film's "most appreciative" 
viewers will be from the "mature" segment of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Armstrong, Morgan Creek is selling the film mainly to the 
under-30 crowd, which knows the original "Exorcist" from its frequent showings 
on TV, cable and video and "doesn't even remember the second one." 
</P>
<P>
The critics, however, may remember the previous entries. Predicted Armstrong: 
"They'll be gunning for us because it's a sequel. And let's face it, it's going 
to be difficult to get the good reviews and the notoriety that the very first 
'Exorcist' got." 
</P>
<P>
He hastened to add that Morgan Creek is "very proud" of "Exorcist III." "We 
stand behind it. But we also stand behind the marketing program we've come up 
with. We're doing this in the best interest of the picture." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think we're hiding anything," stressed Carter De Haven, the film's 
producer, who claims he originally sought to have a big publicity junket for 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
And now? "We'll know soon enough -- in some cases by Saturday or Sunday -- if 
the reviews will be positive or not. If they're mixed, or negative, we still 
have a chance to get the people in over the weekend."

A RESPECTABLE 'INTO WOODS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods" is briefly back in the Los Angeles area, 
for the first time since the national tour originated at the Ahmanson. This 
ingenious examination of a group of fairy tales is at Pierce College's main 
theater, a much more intimate space (375 seats) than the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
The company is the Soap Box Players, a community theater that's using one 
Equity actor. 
</P>
<P>
The revival will best be appreciated by those who already have seen the show 
and/or listened to the album and want to refresh their memories. There are some 
strong, well-cast singer/actors here, especially Jeff Wallach as Jack, Darryl 
D. Winslow as the Baker and Fiama Fricano as the Baker's Wife. But on opening 
night, Roy Spicer III's orchestra overwhelmed some of the lyrics sung by the 
production's weaker cast members, especially in the first part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Lima cast a recent sixth-grade graduate, Suzy Ekerling, as Little Red 
Riding Hood, and she handles this difficult role with considerable assurance. 
Lima, producer Kevin Traxler and set designer Kelly Asbury all work on Walt 
Disney animated features, and the sets and costumes -- while certainly not as 
sophisticated as the original company's -- have a nice Disneyish look. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more performances at 6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills: Friday and 
Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m. $15; (818) 241-3665.

CHANNEL 4 NEWS PLANNING STAFF TRIMS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: KNBC TO ELIMINATE NINE UNION JOBS. OTHER CUTS ARE LIKELY TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fresh off a clean sweep in the July ratings book, KNBC Channel 4's news 
department will eliminate at least nine union jobs before the end of the year, 
according to a local representative of the National Assn. of Broadcast 
Employees and Technicians (NABET). Additional layoffs of non-NABET newsroom 
personnel are also expected at the NBC-owned station. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Smith, president of NABET Local 53, said he was informed this week that 
9 or 10 NABET news writers, editors, field crews and couriers would not have 
their jobs at year's end and that some of the layoffs will take effect as early 
as next month. He said that cuts in non-union jobs would be even deeper. 
</P>
<P>
A KNBC spokeswoman confirmed that there will be "some layoffs, mostly through 
attrition and voluntary layoffs" as part of the station's "ongoing staff 
analysis to provide maximum efficiency." She declined to specify how many or 
what kinds of positions will be eliminated or whether the cuts would be limited 
to the 9 or 10 NABET positions. She said that the layoffs would not affect 
KNBC's "on-air product." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the cuts were implemented after NBC conducted a survey at its 
Denver affiliate, which broadcasts four hours of news a day with a much smaller 
staff than the one at KNBC. Denver is the 19th-largest television market in the 
country with about 20% of the total number of viewing households of the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided that if Denver could put on a newscast with a certain number of 
people, then they saw no reason why Los Angeles couldn't do it with the same 
number of people," Smith said. "But it's like comparing apples and oranges. You 
can't compare the markets, you can't compare the sales revenue, you can't 
compare the product. This is a network-owned station, covering a huge area and 
doing it very well. This is our reward for finishing No. 1 in the nation's No. 
2 market." 
</P>
<P>
Though the station has yet to make any official announcement, KNBC has been 
contemplating the addition of a 9 a.m. newscast to its current schedule of four 
hours of weekday news. Smith suggested that the cutbacks would have even been 
larger were the station not planning the additional show. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he would attempt to work out details of the layoffs in the coming 
week. He hopes that most of those leaving would volunteer to be part of a 
buyout offer that in the past, he said, has paid a 20-year veteran about one 
year's salary as incentive. If there are not enough volunteers for such a 
program, the least senior members in each eliminated position would be forcibly 
laid off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an action that a network spokeswoman said was unrelated to the 
cuts at KNBC, NBC on Wednesday unilaterally implemented the terms of an 
unratified four-year contract with NABET. The union leaders responded by filing 
an unfair labor practices charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
in New York. Union members have been working without a contract since March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The NABET membership at the NBC-owned-and-operated stations in New York, Los 
Angeles/Burbank, Washington, Chicago and Cleveland -- including 2,373 news 
writers, engineers and technicians -- had rejected the proposed contract. The 
network said it decided to implement the contract since negotiations had 
reached an impasse. NABET officials claimed that negotiations have not reached 
an impasse and that the union is willing to bargain in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the complaint filed with the NLRB was the first of several legal 
measures the union will take in an effort to force NBC back to the bargaining 
table. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, NBC also declared an impasse in negotiations with the union and 
implemented its final offer. At that time, the NLRB rejected a similar union 
complaint and the union eventually went on strike for 17 weeks.

U.S. SKEPTICAL OF JORDAN PLEDGE ON EMBARGO

KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, after an emergency meeting Thursday with Jordan's King Hussein, 
said he was "very pleased" by a renewed Jordanian pledge to honor the U.N. 
embargo against Iraq, but Administration officials privately expressed fear 
that the king may still help Iraq obtain basic foodstuffs and other vital 
material. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, whose country is economically dependent on neighboring Iraq, has 
been a reluctant supporter of the U.N. sanctions from the beginning. And, while 
reaffirming his willingness to abide by U.N. policy after meeting in 
Kennebunkport with Bush, Hussein indicated that he may allow material 
classified as "humanitarian" to reach Iraq through Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, meanwhile, for the first time issued detailed, formal orders to 
U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf region to intercept all ships and cargoes 
bound to or from Iraq or Kuwait. The orders provide Navy commanders with 
explicit guidelines for enforcing the "interdiction" policy announced by Bush 
after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraqi trade last week. 
</P>
<P>
The orders will cover the Jordanian port of Aqaba, Pentagon sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Aqaba, at the northern end of the Red Sea, has become a critical element in the 
U.S.-led international effort to pressure Iraq into retreat from Kuwait. 
Although the port is in Jordan, it serves as a main conduit for goods destined 
for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged that Aqaba poses a particularly difficult problem for 
Bush because it is not only a transshipment point for Baghdad but also the sole 
port of entry for Jordan itself. And Jordan, under Hussein, is America's oldest 
Arab ally in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the pivotal nature of Jordan's role and the vulnerability of the 
king's position, Bush publicly put a bright face on their meeting, saying: "The 
differences that possibly existed with Jordan have been narrowed." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Administration officials conceded that serious questions remain 
about the role King Hussein will play in the mounting confrontation with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We leaned on him and he promised, but there's little doubt that he's playing 
for time. He was in a no-win situation before, and now it's even worse," one 
Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The king, his demeanor tense and serious as he emerged from his two-hour 
session with Bush, refused to say whether he would close Aqaba to Iraqi 
commerce. "This is a question of detail. The government is dealing with it," 
was all he would say on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein had come to Kennebunkport hoping to serve as an intermediary in a 
diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
two weeks ago, sources close to the monarch said. But Bush made it clear that 
the United States sees no basis for negotiation until Iraq pulls out its 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said King Hussein would not give up attempts to find middle ground. "He 
feels we are now in a tunnel and that he is the only light in that tunnel," a 
knowledgeable source said. But Arab diplomats acknowledged that prospects for a 
quick diplomatic solution are diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're in for the long haul," said a State Department official. "Now 
it's all up to Saddam Hussein," the president of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, after his meeting with King Hussein, met separately with Saudi Foreign 
Minister Saud al Faisal. Later, the Saudi official provided reporters with a 
decidedly pessimistic assessment of the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We still hope that conflict can be avoided but . . . if, and only if, Iraq 
withdraws from Kuwait," the Saudi foreign minister said just before leaving 
Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush, at a news conference after the two meetings, declared: "We're in sync 
with the Saudis." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's "intercept" directives were sent just hours after Bush bid 
goodby to King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Pentagon had sent an earlier set of orders to ships 
Wednesday night, but Bush's political advisers hurriedly withdrew them, fearing 
that their dissemination during Hussein's visit with the President would 
embarrass the Jordanian monarch. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration lawyers refined the orders throughout the day Thursday, but 
a senior Pentagon official said Hussein's pledge had not affected the wording 
of the orders. 
</P>
<P>
By using the term "intercept," the Pentagon's directive legally falls short of 
a blockade -- potentially an act of war against Iraq. But U.S. warships are 
authorized to stop and board ships headed in the direction of ports supplying 
Iraq and to "use the minimum force necessary . . . to turn away or otherwise 
divert" ships carrying goods to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said all ships destined for Iraq or Kuwait would be stopped and 
boarded and diverted if necessary. In addition, the Pentagon said U.S. ships 
would be permitted to intercept vessels traveling to or from ports of other 
Middle East countries and carrying material destined for or originating from 
Iraq or Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of ships entering or leaving the Gulf of Aqaba, a senior Pentagon 
official said the commander of a U.S. Navy ship would be permitted to judge 
whether vessels are carrying goods bound for Iraq or Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced that it is sending a 15,000-man Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade to Saudi Arabia, which will bring the Marine presence 
there to more than 45,000. Thirteen amphibious ships pulled out of the Navy's 
port at Norfolk, Va., to pick up the Marines, based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrive in the Persian Gulf in a little over two weeks, the Marines, 
equipped with more than 50 tanks and a host of armored vehicles and howitzers, 
would be able to fight their way ashore if Iraqi and American forces in Saudi 
Arabia are engaged in combat. 
</P>
<P>
Two more Marine brigades -- roughly 30,000 troops -- are on alert and ready for 
possible deployment to Saudi Arabia. The addition of those brigades, including 
one from Camp Pendleton, could bring the Marine presence to 75,000, although 
officials said no final decision has been made to send the remaining units. 
</P>
<P>
A day after sending dozens of its high-tech F-117 Stealth fighters to Saudi 
Arabia, the Air Force announced that it also has sent some of its A-10 
Thunderbolt aircraft, specially designed as tank killers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bush said that he is continuing to consider a limited call-up of 
military reserves. But Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that any such 
call-up would probably involve a limited number of part-time soldiers whose 
specialties are in short supply in the active-duty forces. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the meetings with King Hussein and the Saudi foreign minister, 
Bush spoke by telephone Thursday with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey and with 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told Mubarak of Hussein's statement of support for the U.N. sanctions, 
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings in Maine reflected the Administration's efforts to maintain as 
much support among the Arab states as possible. But there was no outward sign 
of success, with the expressions on the faces of the officials uniformly 
serious and tense. 
</P>
<P>
Using the accepted diplomatic parlance that often conveys a failure to bridge 
differences, it was, Hussein said, "a very frank, open and candid discussion." 
</P>
<P>
The king told reporters that no agreements had been reached. Nor, he said, had 
he carried any message from Saddam Hussein, with whom he visited in Baghdad 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had any reason for hope, he replied, without much animation: 
"I suppose one has to have hope. Without hope you can't get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein arrived at Bush's 11-acre compound at Walker's Point at midday, 
accompanied by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, aboard a U.S. Marine 
Corps helicopter that carried him from Pease Air Force Base. He said that he 
planned to return to Jordan after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and the king met first in private and then -- over lunch -- in an expanded 
conference with six advisers each. 
</P>
<P>
Faisal arrived about 30 minutes after Hussein had departed. He was greeted by 
Baker and walked immediately toward Bush's home. 
</P>
<P>
The concern about the port of Aqaba reflects even broader questions about 
adherence to the U.N. sanctions, imposed by a 13-0 vote of the Security Council 
on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions are the centerpiece of an international effort, spearheaded by 
Bush, to squeeze Iraqi President Saddam Hussein (no relation to King Hussein) 
into submission, and Jordan's compliance with the sanctions is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased that King Hussein, who previously had announced his support 
for sanctions . . . reiterated that to me, making clear that this was a 
decision that Jordan had taken some time ago," Bush told reporters at a news 
conference on his lawn moments after the second of the two meetings ended. 
</P>
<P>
But that was not the impression left by King Hussein in his brief comments to 
reporters while Bush was preparing to receive Faisal, the Saudi foreign 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
He said his nation had stated "very clearly at the very outset . . . that it 
regarded these mandatory sanctions and measures as ones that the government of 
Jordan would respect. And this has been the case." 
</P>
<P>
But he said Jordan is seeking clarification about whether the embargo includes 
food. "I believe there are certain categories or areas where the situation is 
unclear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, however, has been adamant on that point. On Sunday, the President said 
tersely that the embargo includes "everything, everything." Later, his 
spokesman said that medical supplies are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Wednesday that King Hussein, in stating that he was seeking 
clarification from the United Nations about the scope of the sanctions, "meant 
. . . that there is a provision in the sanctions that permits food for 
humanitarian purposes." 
</P>
<P>
"There's really been no definition of exactly when that triggers and what that 
means," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The question -- central to the opposition to Saddam Hussein -- is more 
important for Jordan than any other embargo participant. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan finds itself squeezed on both ends, caught by its economic reliance on 
trade with Iraq as well as by diplomatic pressure from the West, with which it 
has long sought to get along as a representative of the more moderate Arab 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan's main exports are to Iraq -- over $2 billion (a year). Our oil imports 
are from Iraq. Our services and transportation are from Iraq," a senior 
Jordanian official said. On the other hand, he said, the Jordanian economy 
benefits from money sent home by Jordanian citizens working in Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia and the other gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush said that he believes the sanctions "are beginning to take 
hold." 
</P>
<P>
"There doesn't appear to be any shipments of oil coming out of Iraq. And that 
is very positive because I think 90% of their foreign exchange . . . is based 
on petroleum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President said he could cite no evidence, however, that the impact is being 
felt in Iraq, save "one little tidbit" -- bakers had been ordered to halt 
production of confectionary goods to produce more basic foods. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think one can sustain true international isolation for long, 
especially when you depend on the outside world for a lot of your goods," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he was not totally satisfied regarding compliance with the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to guard against cheaters. You've got to guard against people who, 
for economic gain, will try to violate these sanctions from whatever part of 
the world they come from, whatever country they come from," he said.

<P>
COUNTY GOVERNMENT: PANEL OF FEDERAL APPEALS JUDGES PUTS ELECTION FOR 1ST 
DISTRICT SUPERVISOR ON HOLD.

<P>
A federal appeals court on Thursday indefinitely blocked a dramatic 
reapportionment of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and postponed 
the November election to replace incumbent Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to extend a stay they issued last week, the three-judge panel of 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the historic voting rights 
case raises "difficult and close legal questions" and that the status quo 
should remain pending the outcome of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. District Court earlier this month had found that the Board of 
Supervisors intentionally discriminated against Latinos in the drawing of 
district boundaries. The lower court threw out the results of the June primary 
election, drew new district lines to create a Latino-majority district and set 
a special election for November. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court last week temporarily stayed the District Court decision 
and, after hearing oral arguments Thursday morning, the appeals court 
indefinitely extended its stay. 
</P>
<P>
Latino groups, who brought the suit and were backed by the U.S. Justice 
Department, had expected that the court-ordered reapportionment would lead to 
the election of the first Latino supervisor in county history. The supervisors 
bitterly criticized the reapportionment and had appealed the District Court 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 appeals court ruling was seen as a surprise by all parties and angered 
the winners of the June primary election in the 1st District who had hoped to 
meet in a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered that there be neither a runoff between June primary 
victors Sarah Flores and Gregory O'Brien, nor a special election in a redrawn 
1st District in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather the equities favor maintaining the status quo" pending the outcome of 
the county's appeal, wrote Judges Robert R. Beezer and Alex Kozinski. 
"Accordingly, the county shall hold no election for supervisor, District 1, 
pending further order of this court." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Dorothy Nelson dissented, saying she would have denied the county's stay 
request. 
</P>
<P>
The court will hear arguments on the county's appeal in October and could rule 
any time after that. 
</P>
<P>
County attorney John McDermott said, "I'm thrilled. Our primary concern was 
that there not be irreversible change in the status quo until the merits of the 
case could be reviewed. . . . We would have preferred that the Sarah Flores 
election go forward, but this is a middle ground that is fair" to all parties. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who attended the hearing, called the ruling a 
"mixed blessing." He said he is encouraged by the tone of the judges who 
appeared to have a better understanding of what's at stake for voters than the 
district court judge, who he accused of "ideological manipulation" of the 
electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Schabarum said he thought the ruling is appropriate, adding, "It 
appears to me the appellate court is attempting to sort out the extraordinary 
mischief" done in the district court. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fajardo, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, a plaintiff, said he is considering seeking a review of the 
decision by a larger, 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit or appealing to Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems as if they spread the benefits and the hurt around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John R. Dunne, assistant attorney general for civil rights, made a rare trip 
from Washington to argue for a new primary in November in a redrawn 1st 
District. Supervisor Deane Dana also attended the hearing, as did Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne urged the judges to allow a November election in the new, predominantly 
Latino district to remedy the "egregious wrong that has been suffered by the 
Hispanic community so long." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Board of Supervisors had asked the appeals court to allow the 
Flores-O'Brien runoff to proceed and to stay implementation of a redistricting 
plan pending the outcome of the county's appeal of the lower court ruling that 
reapportioned the district. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon approved the redistricting plan on Aug. 3, 
finding that the Board of Supervisors had diluted Latino voting power by 
splitting the community among three supervisorial districts. 
</P>
<P>
If the reapportionment is upheld, Latinos would comprise 51% of the voters and 
71% of the population in the new 1st District. Latinos now comprise 25% of the 
voters in the district, while 49% of its population is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of indefinitely postponing the November election was raised for 
the first time by Judge Kozinski from the bench Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski suggested that holding no election until the appeal is decided would 
prevent candidates from wasting time and money to win an election that could be 
nullified. 
</P>
<P>
Flores called the ruling "shocking and deeply disappointing" but vowed to run 
no matter when an election is held. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said the ruling was "disturbingly ambiguous. . . . It doesn't give 
anybody enough to go on." 
</P>
<P>
"They only cancel elections in places like Nicaragua," said O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Until he gets a clarification and some idea of when an election might be held, 
O'Brien said he will continue his campaign. "I'll be back in the (campaign) 
office tomorrow, and I expect everyone else to be here too." 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said the ruling, if upheld, would allow Schabarum, who has said he 
plans to retire at the end of his term on Dec. 3, to stay in office until a 
successor could be appointed or elected. If Schabarum resigned, his seat could 
remain vacant or the governor could appoint a successor who would serve until 
an election could be held. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Schabarum, who hinted last week that he might run in the new 
district, would only say, "I'm on until replaced." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said, "I would hope Mr. Schabarum would retire and allow 
the governor to make an appointment, but I don't think (Schabarum) will." Dana 
said he is certain that Governor George Deukmejian would appoint Flores to fill 
any unexpired term. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said a date for the election to choose Schabarum's successor would 
depend on how long it takes the appeals court to decide on the county's appeal. 
"It is hard to predict how long it will take to get an opinion out," McDermott 
said. "It could be three or four months." 
</P>
<P>
McDermott had argued that it is too late to prepare for a November election in 
a new district without jeopardizing the entire November election, including 
balloting for governor. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the judges to resolve the legal questions raised by the historic case 
"before you interfere in the local electoral process" and let Flores meet 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bourke, an attorney for Flores, argued that it would be unfair to call 
off the November runoff when Flores stands a chance of becoming the first 
Latina and the first woman elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, after she has mortgaged her house to run, after she mobilized $400,000 of 
support and successfully ran the primary race through completion, she is told 
to start over," Bourke said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien too said that he must soon make a decision about continuing with the 
campaign or going back to work. "At some point my resources will be tapped 
out," said O'Brien who has taken a leave of absence from his Superior Court 
post to run for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the appeals court, the Justice Department had talked about 
that problem: "Clearly, both candidates ran this year knowing full well that 
the 1981 redistricting plan was under legal attack and could be invalidated. . 
. . The inconvenience to these two individuals is hardly harm sufficient to 
forestall the long-overdue grant of constitutionally protected voting rights to 
citizens of Los Angeles County."

IRAQ ESCALATES VERBAL WAR, TELLS BUSH: 'NO GOING BACK' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed Thursday that Iraqi troops will not 
withdraw from occupied Kuwait, declaring in a televised "open letter" to 
President Bush: "There is no going back." 
</P>
<P>
In a personal lecture laden with prophesies of disaster, Hussein told Bush that 
"you, the President of the United States, have chosen to be a liar like the 
band you have selected and consider to represent the Arab nation." 
</P>
<P>
He warned that U.S. support of the Kuwaiti regime -- "backward oil emirs," he 
called them -- puts American soldiers in peril. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray to God that the two sides will not clash," he said, "because if they 
do, thousands of Americans whom you have pushed into this dark tunnel will go 
home in shrouded coffins." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's message, advertised hours in advance, was read by a studio announcer 
as Jordan's King Hussein traveled to Maine for talks with Bush. It contained no 
new initiatives but reflected President Hussein's smoldering anger at Bush's 
charge in a Pentagon speech Wednesday that the Iraqi leader had lied when he 
promised not to invade Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The man you hate the most," the message said, "is Saddam Hussein, because of 
his truthfulness to his principles, to himself, and to his people and nation. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Since the rapid buildup of U.S. troops and hardware in support of Saudi Arabia, 
Hussein has sought by means of broadcasts and diplomatic maneuvers to turn Arab 
opinion in his favor. He has repeatedly denounced the Persian Gulf intervention 
by foreign governments but has rarely mentioned his conquest of Kuwait on Aug. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Kennebunkport, Me., Bush said he had not reviewed the 
entire speech but had seen some excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clear that what we need to do at this point is to enforce the 
international law. The statements at the United Nations from many countries 
really say it all. So there's no point in me responding. . . ," the President 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Iraqi leadership sought to put the best face on the 
peace concessions it offered to Iran a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's Arab enemies said that Hussein's vaunted army has blinked. In Saudi 
Arabia, the daily Al Jazira commented: "Saddam Hussein has entered a stage of 
weakness and confusion which has reached the point of humiliation and 
disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Iraqi government remained defiant and threatening. The Iraqi 
air defense force warned that it is "prepared to repulse the aggression" and 
cannot guarantee the safety of foreign pilots bailing out of damaged planes 
over Iraqi territory. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, government and ruling-party newspapers said that peace with Iran 
will "give Iraq added strength and more resources for victory," permitting the 
military command to withdraw 30 divisions -- at least 300,000 men -- from the 
eastern frontier to confront the American, European and Arab forces deployed to 
the south in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iraqi press organs moved to motivate political opposition to 
foreign intervention in the Middle East, an issue potentially more powerful 
than 30 divisions. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry statement called for "a popular Islamic consensus which 
rejects this Crusader pollution of Islamic holy places . . . to eliminate this 
American intervention and free Mecca and the tomb of the Great Prophet from 
this disgraceful filth." 
</P>
<P>
This message was aimed particularly at Iran -- and may have touched receptive 
ears. In Tehran, where the United States continues to be the "Great Satan," 
officials have adopted a split policy on the Kuwait crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran rejects the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait, ostensibly on principle but also 
because of the greater territorial and oil power it gives Iraq in the Persian 
Gulf region. It also fears that the invasion and Saudi Arabia's acceptance of 
foreign troops on its soil have introduced a third force that will be hard to 
dispel. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, in a telephone conversation with Turkish 
President Turgut Ozal, expressed Iran's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian news agency IRNA, Rafsanjani drew a line between peace 
with Iraq, which has been received with enthusiasm in Tehran, and the invasion 
of Kuwait. He also alluded to foreign intervention, a political plague among 
the ruling clerics in Tehran since the days when the United States delivered 
Western ways along with support for the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace with Iraq is a different issue," Rafsanjani reportedly told Ozal, whose 
government is supporting U.N. sanctions against Baghdad. "We hold to our view 
that Iraq must evacuate from Kuwaiti territory so as to create the necessary 
conditions for re-establishment of peace and tranquillity. We believe that the 
problem which has been created in the region must be solved by the regional 
countries in cooperation with one another." 
</P>
<P>
Most Arab nations agree with Iran that the Kuwaiti invasion and annexation is 
unacceptable and that the crisis can be resolved only by an Iraqi withdrawal or 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Iraqi leader's motives in offering peace to Iran, officials in 
Tehran have been quick to portray it as capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that Iraq finally accepted the principled view of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran," Morteza Sarmadi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said when 
Baghdad Radio announced the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian newspapers on Thursday hailed the surprise announcement as a "great 
victory for the Iranian revolutionary nation." 
</P>
<P>
Sadegh Khalkhali, a cleric who is anti-American, said that "all countries" must 
press Hussein to withdraw and added that Saudi King Fahd "has become like the 
governor of Alabama, but on Hijaz (Saudi) soil." Islamic nations and Arab 
countries, he said, "should try at any cost to make the world-devouring America 
leave the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Late reports from IRNA said the top political and military leaders of Iran's 
National Security Council have taken "appropriate decisions" in response to 
Hussein's offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader, telling Rafsanjani that "everything you wanted . . . has been 
realized," promised an immediate exchange of prisoners of war, withdrawal of 
Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and acceptance of a 1975 accord that gave 
Iran sovereignty over the eastern half of the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that 
forms a section of the frontier between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that officials of Iran's Red Crescent Society have gone to the 
Iraqi border to receive Iranian prisoners. Hussein had said that the first of 
the Iranian POWs will be turned over today.

Vicki Long, the Roman Catholic lay minister whose affair with former Archbishop 
Eugene Marino led to his downfall, said Thursday that she married the prelate 
in December, 1988, and that "I love him and . . . stand by him." 
</P>
<P>
Long, 27, said that church officials knew of her relationship with Marino since 
the two exchanged rings in a ceremony performed by Marino. "I have considered 
myself to be married to him since that time," she said, reading from a brief 
statement at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Marino, 56, stepped down July 10, claiming he was in need of medical and 
psychological therapy. Last month, his successor, Bishop James P. Lyke, 
announced that the main reason for Marino's resignation was the Long affair. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who accompanied Long at the news 
conference, portrayed her as a victim of sexual misconduct who turned to the 
church for solace, only to be further abused. Allred also provided a detailed 
description of Marino's behavior with Long. 
</P>
<P>
Long and Marino "went on numerous trips together, and they often stayed at 
hotels and were often registered as husband and wife," Allred said. Marino told 
Long that he intended to let "everyone know, including the Pope," about their 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to have a child together," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
Long has been at the center of a growing scandal in Atlanta involving reports 
that she had sexual relations with Marino, along with other Catholic officials. 
She has filed a paternity suit alleging that her daughter, born May 17, 1986, 
was fathered by a priest -- not Marino. Blood tests proved he was not the 
father, but the church is paying child support. Long also has said that she was 
once seduced by a nun. 
</P>
<P>
Allred declined to say whether she would file a suit against the church. But 
the news conference seemed designed to lay a foundation of blame on the church 
for Long's involvement with church officials. 
</P>
<P>
Allred claimed that Marino seduced Long when she went to him for comfort over 
the affair she had had with the priest. 
</P>
<P>
"(Marino) professed his love to her and began a sexual relationship with her 
which lasted for two years." During that time, she said, the two "spent almost 
every night together when he was in town," openly attending concerts, the 
theater and eating at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Long still loves Marino, Allred said, and she said the relationship is "far 
from over," asserting that up until last week, Marino "was still calling her 
and telling her that he wanted to be with her." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the marriage was legal, Allred said: "In Ms. Long's eyes, she is 
married in the eyes of God." She refused to say whether a marriage certificate 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta television station WAGA reported Wednesday that Marino, who church 
officials said was admitted to a psychiatric hospital last Thursday, had 
overdosed on sleeping pills and was under a suicide watch at St. Vincent's 
Hospital in Harrison, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Lyke categorically denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Long, apparently fighting back sobs, said: "I encourage 
Archbishop Marino to be strong and to know that I love him and that I stand by 
him."

<P>
Actors' Equity on Thursday reversed its controversial decision to bar British 
actor Jonathan Pryce from playing a Eurasian on Broadway in the hit London 
musical "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
The move leaves the door open for producer Cameron Mackintosh to bring the 
$10-million musical to New York. Last week, he canceled the show rather than 
let Equity dictate his choice of star. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released through a publicist, Mackintosh said he was encouraged 
by Thursday's decision. "Over the next few days, I will confer with members of 
the creative team and with Jonathan Pryce to determine if it will be possible 
for the production to be reinstated for Broadway," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Saigon," which had a $25-million advance ticket sale, the largest in 
Broadway history, had been scheduled to open in March. 
</P>
<P>
The new Equity ruling, reached after a six-hour session of the union's council, 
met with mixed reaction on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Eisenberg, Equity executive secretary, apologized for the rancor that has 
colored the debate, saying the union never intended the dispute to become "one 
of personalities and innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
Equity's original decision to bar Pryce in order to promote minority casting 
opportunities met with a storm of protest from union members who petitioned 
Equity to reconsider its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Asian-American theater community had applauded the original 
decision, which set off a national debate. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg said Thursday that the Equity council had determined that Pryce 
qualifies as a "star" under the union's agreement with the League of American 
Theatres and Producers and, therefore, that his casting was not subject to 
Equity approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people would have been happier had it been an Asian (playing 
the role)," Eisenberg said, when asked to characterize the meeting at a press 
conference at Equity's New York headquarters. "But we deferred to the contract; 
we deferred to Mr. Pryce's talent, and we deferred to Mr. Mackintosh's wishes 
to have Mr. Pryce play the role." 
</P>
<P>
"M. Butterfly" playwright David Henry Hwang, whose protest of Pryce's casting 
helped trigger the controversy, used a moderate tone in a written statement 
Thursday: "I have stated my intention to support whatever decision Actors' 
Equity feels best reflects the interest of its membership, and I stand by that 
today. I do hope that the complex issues of opportunities for minority actors 
and artistic freedom will continue to be discussed, albeit in a less polarized 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Dewhurst, the president of Actors' Equity who had likened "Miss Saigon" 
to a "minstrel show," did not appear at Thursday's press conference because she 
was filming in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Eisenberg delineated Equity's policy toward 
non-traditional casting, which, he said, was "distorted and misconstrued" in 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
According to the contract between Equity and the Theatre League, 
non-traditional casting is "the casting of ethnic actors in roles where race or 
gender is not germane to the character," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Jensen, executive director of the Non-Traditional Casting Project, a 
nonprofit arts organization that lobbies for the hiring of minority actors, 
lauded the new ruling. She said the 50-member cast of "Miss Saigon" includes 
parts for 34 minority actors. "Assuming this show's a success, it can mean 
literally hundreds of jobs for ethnic actors" as touring companies are later 
formed, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Sab Shimono, who auditioned for Pryce's role last January in Los Angeles 
and was a member of the original cast of "Pacific Overtures" on Broadway, was 
bitter over the decision to allow Pryce to perform on Broadway. "I suppose 
we're still part of the colony . . . . The good thing is that the discussion is 
out in the open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did they (Actors' Equity) collapse?" asked Dom Magwili, who resigned his 
post as director of the AsianAmerican Theatre Project at Los Angeles Theatre 
Center because he disagreed with an LATC official's statement condemning 
Equity's original decision. "Because $25 million in advance sales is a tough 
argument. Jobs are valued more than principle. In the end," Magwili said, "it's 
the money that talks." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad decision. It'll set us back 20 years," said actor Robert Hooks, a 
star of the 1988 ABC series "Supercarrier" and co-founder of the Negro Ensemble 
Company in New York and the now-defunct D. C. Black Repertory Theatre. "Only 
the minorities are crying. They're a small voice -- or that's how they're 
viewed on the Great White Way. To make this decision and then retract it is a 
real kick in the behind." 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said he had heard "a lot of intellectual arguments about artistic 
integrity." Although some jobs for minorities may be restored if the show now 
goes on, Hooks said: "There's a tremendous principle here that goes far beyond 
'Miss Saigon.' " 
</P>
<P>
Charlton Heston, who resigned his active membership in Equity in protest of the 
original decision to bar Pryce, said he would not change his mind. "I objected 
to what they did. Now they have stopped doing it. But they still did it. The 
reason they gave in was because there was a firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
"My central concern is not Jonathan Pryce or the numbers of fine Asian actors 
who are underemployed. We're talking about artistic freedom here." 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Velina Hasu Houston, president of the Amerasian League in Santa 
Monica, said that despite its reversal on the issue, "Equity has accomplished 
some important things. The Asian-American community has spoken up and said 
yellowface has to go the way of blackface, and Equity has shown support for 
that voice, despite this decision. Producers have shown their true colors . . . 
. Neither side heard the other side." "That has been the most unfortunate thing 
in this situation.

TERRORISM / GAVIRIA'S OTHER CHALLENGE; 
</P>

GUERRILLA ATTACKS CUT OIL REVENUE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COLOMBIA PRESIDENT MUST FIND WAY TO PACIFY REBEL GROUP

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the toughest challenges faced by Colombia's new president, Cesar 
Gaviria, is how to stop attacks by an armed group whose terrorist tactics have 
cost the country millions of dollars. The enemy in this case is not the 
Medellin cocaine cartel but a small band of leftist guerrillas, the National 
Liberation Army, or ELN. 
</P>
<P>
The Marxist-Leninist group has caused serious damage to both the economy and 
environment through an unrelenting sabotage campaign against petroleum 
facilities. ELN leaders say they want the government to nationalize the oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, in his efforts to pacify the country, must give priority to either 
coaxing or forcing the ELN's estimated 2,000 armed members to lay down their 
weapons, government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The ELN has inflicted its greatest damage by dynamiting the country's main oil 
pipeline, which runs about 500 miles from the rich Cano Limon oil field on the 
Venezuelan border to the Caribbean port of Covenas. Since 1986, 125 attacks 
have cost the industry nearly $500 million in lost production and repairs, the 
state oil company Ecopetrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Future bombings are sure to be more costly. As a result of the Persian Gulf 
crisis, the world price of crude has risen, and Colombia, fighting a costly war 
with drug traffickers, needs the extra foreign exchange promised by the 
increase. The country exports about 200,000 barrels a day, almost all of it 
transported through the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if the ELN dynamites it, the delay in exporting will mean much more in 
terms of lost income," said Luis Soto, a Bogota petroleum consultant. "Making 
peace with the guerrillas is more important than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts say the environment has suffered more than the oil industry at the 
hands of the ELN. Ecopetrol just completed a $1.4-million cleanup of what 
environmental officials call one of the worst messes ever left by an ELN 
attack. A May 12 attack on the pipeline caused 14,200 barrels of oil to spill 
into the country's largest body of fresh water, the Zapatosa marsh, which feeds 
the Magdalena River in northeastern Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
President Gaviria, who succeeded Virgilio Barco on Aug. 7, says he will try to 
stop the ELN violence by continuing his predecessor's peace strategy, which 
stressed quick demobilization of guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The one guerrilla group to lay down its arms under the plan, the April 19 
Movement, or M-19, received several official promises in return. Among them was 
a guarantee that the government would work to reform the political system, long 
dominated by the Liberal and Conservative parties. 
</P>
<P>
The M-19's first presidential candidate, Antonio Navarro, finished third in the 
May 27 elections, and Gaviria, a member of the Liberal Party, appointed him 
health minister. The government is negotiating with three other small leftist 
guerrilla groups and has guaranteed their participation in a November assembly 
to reform the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
ELN leaders dismiss the peace initiative as a farce. Some political scientists 
say the government will have to turn up military pressure on the guerrillas if 
it wants to persuade them to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
But Gonzalo De Francisco, one of Gaviria's peace advisers, says the 
administration's main weapon will be state money invested in regions where the 
ELN operates. Barco's Administration spent millions of dollars on public works 
projects in the states, including some ELN strongholds. De Francisco said the 
program would be expanded under Gaviria. 
</P>
<P>
Spending of another kind played a role in the rise of the ELN. Colombian 
officials accuse the German firm that built the Cano Limon pipeline of paying 
the ELN a $6-million "oil tax" to let the work proceed in 1983. That payment 
whetted the guerrillas' appetite for petroleum dollars and led to a string of 
kidnapings of foreign oil executives and other forms of extortion. The tactics 
transformed the ragtag band of rebels into a potent economic force in several 
rural regions. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials and oil executives say the changes in the Communist world 
have removed the ELN's ideological footing. But few here believe the ELN is 
ready to stop attacking the pipeline.

PAKISTAN / THE OLD GUARD RETURNS; 
</P>
<P>
SPURNED BY BHUTTO, HE GETS EVEN

<P>
He was one of the "uncles," a key party elder who served for decades as 
adviser, alter ego and personal confidant of Benazir Bhutto's father, Zulfikar 
Ali Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
He stood beside the elder Bhutto whether in power or in prison, holding six 
separate Cabinet posts during Zulfikar's seven years of rule, then spending a 
year in solitary confinement after the 1977 military coup that drove the elder 
Bhutto from power. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi was Old Guard, patriarch of a 
political family even older than the Bhuttos. And when the young and 
charismatic Bhutto daughter returned to Pakistan in 1986 from exile, promising 
to lead the nation from the darkness of martial law into a new dawn of 
democracy, Jatoi, it appeared, had outlived his usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
The split was a public one, irreparable. And, in many ways, it sowed the seeds 
of Benazir's recent fall from power. For now, Bhutto is out and Jatoi is 
Pakistan's new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
If it all sounds a bit feudal, such is the nature of Pakistani politics. The 
falling out between the younger Bhutto and her father's former lieutenant, a 
personal rejection that forced Jatoi out of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party 
and into the opposition camp four years ago, helps explain the sudden change at 
the top in Pakistan earlier this month, when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan fired 
Bhutto, accusing her of rampant corruption, nepotism and mismanagement and 
appointed Jatoi as caretaker in her place. 
</P>
<P>
But it also helps define the character of Pakistan's new leader, the 
59-year-old, Westernized political veteran who will chart the course of one of 
America's closest Third World allies, at least until new elections are held 
Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest change is really one of style," said Kamal Azfar, Jatoi's closest 
personal adviser and now a member of his Cabinet. "The entire politics of 
internal confrontation has been replaced by a politics of consensus. This is 
Mr. Jatoi's style, and his goal is to gradually rebuild confidence in 
institutions rather than individuals." 
</P>
<P>
The key word there, according to veteran Pakistani political analysts, is 
"gradual." Jatoi's politics are a vintage strain of old-world deliberation and 
almost-tribal consultation. When his differences with Bhutto in 1986 forced him 
to break ranks and form the rival National People's Party, for example, he 
resisted the temptation to take quick revenge, preferring to plod through the 
years of political confrontation and, as one of his supporters said, "allow 
Benazir time to self-destruct." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the weeks since he was hastily sworn in, Jatoi has pledged 
several times that "there will be no witch-hunt," although Bhutto and her 
supporters remain convinced that the purpose of the corruption courts he has 
established is to charge, try and convict members of the Bhutto clan in time to 
bar them from contesting the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers say Jatoi is working hard to bring together all of the rightist forces 
who opposed Bhutto in the last elections in a united front that will permit him 
to keep his new job, a victory that would amount to a meteoric rise for a 
politician whose party won just one seat -- his own -- in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Critics strongly believe that Pakistan's powerful armed forces were the true 
engineers of what Bhutto charges was "a constitutional coup d'etat." They say 
that if Jatoi exceeds the bounds of permissible politics implicit in the order 
that brought him to power, the army will take power from him as well. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true at all," said his adviser, Azfar. "The army obviously has its 
own weight. The Pentagon certainly has its own weight as a lobbying force in 
America as well. But, in fact, what is now happening is we are consulting 
everyone in all institutions in an effort to rebuild those institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most encouraging for Western interests in Pakistan, though, is Jatoi's 
urbane and secular manner. In a region rife with Islamic fundamentalism, and in 
a nation founded as an Islamic state with 98% of its population Muslims, Jatoi 
favors three-piece suits over Pakistan's pajama-like shalwar-kameez national 
dress. He likes thick cigars, speaks English in perfect idiom, and hardly 
shares the disdain of Pakistan's Islamic priests for alcohol, which has been 
legally banned in Pakistan since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"He clearly is not a fundamentalist," Azfar said. "He is a modern man."

Seven West German warships slipped out of the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven 
and headed for the Mediterranean on Thursday, leaving in their wake a heated 
debate about the military role of a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The ships -- five minesweepers and two support vessels -- are to relieve U.S. 
warships ordered to leave the Mediterranean and move into the troubled Persian 
Gulf, along with ships of Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the matter of West Germany's longstanding, self-imposed ban on 
deploying military force in an area of potential conflict outside Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's takeover in Kuwait, coming on the verge of German unification and at a 
time when Germany is about to recover its full sovereignty for the first time 
since World War II, has touched off a premature confrontation for Germans and 
other Europeans on the question of limiting German military power. 
</P>
<P>
So far, European defense experts seem more relieved than upset at the tenor of 
the debate, which has gone into German military activity only in connection 
with multinational action. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany has to begin to rethink its future (military) role," said Francois 
Heisbourg, head of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. 
"Its defense capabilities (outside Europe) have to have either a national or a 
joint European-Western emphasis. The debate seems to have stressed the second 
option. It shows they have learned the lessons of history." 
</P>
<P>
The debate broke into the public domain earlier in the week with reports that 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had raised the prospect of West German 
military units joining in the Western effort to prevent Iraq from advancing 
beyond Kuwait into Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Kohl emphasized that no binding commitment has been made. They 
said Kohl's thinking reflects his belief that West Germany should support the 
U.S.-led action against Iraq in return for Washington's strong support of 
German unity, which is expected to be complete by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Social Democrats quickly condemned the idea of sending West German 
forces to the Persian Gulf, arguing that to do so would contravene 
constitutional restrictions on the use of German forces. 
</P>
<P>
But Kohl's Christian Democrats argue that restrictions on military activity are 
based not on any constitutional provision but on the policies of successive 
governments. They look on opposition proposals to amend the constitution as 
part of an attempt to limit future German military activity with clear, 
explicit language. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister 
Gerhard Stoltenberg are scheduled to discuss the issue at a meeting in Bonn of 
the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee. On Tuesday, Stoltenberg and Genscher 
will travel to Paris for a meeting of the West European Union to coordinate the 
command of forces sent to the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Raes, a spokesman for the West European Union, said there will be no 
attempt to pressure the Germans to enter the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not up to us," he said, "to ask the West Germans to alter their internal 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
West Germany alone among the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization places virtually all its armed forces under the alliance's 
integrated command. The West Germans have rarely been asked to take part in 
U.N. peacekeeping operations, and on the few occasions when military units have 
been employed it has been for humanitarian purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The Luftwaffe recently helped fly out European civilians trapped by fighting in 
Monrovia, the war-torn capital of Liberia. In 1987, during another crisis in 
the Persian Gulf, West German minesweepers were sent to the Mediterranean to 
relieve allied ships ordered to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Although the restrictive policy has kept West Germany down as a military power, 
few seem to have minded -- in West Germany or in neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
The West German economy has benefited by not having to support military 
ventures in distant places; West German exporters have happily traded with both 
sides in most disputes, and the neighboring countries have been free of the 
fear of revived German militarism.

In what one called "a little cat and mouse," U.S. fliers said Thursday that 
American pilots have locked on their weapons radar on Iraqi planes, which have 
quickly turned and fled. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to play with us," one crew chief said. "If I were in a Mirage 
and an F-15 locked onto me, I'd get out of there fast, too." 
</P>
<P>
When an American jet's weapons systems radar locks onto another plane, it means 
the U.S. jet has found its target and communicated that to its missile. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi pilot knows it, too, because his plane carries a warning system 
something like the "fuzz buster" radar used by some automobile drivers in 
America to warn them that they're under the scrutiny of police radar. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. airmen declined to go into detail, there was no indication 
that any of the encounters involved Iraqi planes attempting to intrude into 
Saudi Arabian air space. The airmen suggested that the encounters occurred 
during missions near the border with Kuwait.

Col. John McBroom, commander of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing from Langley Air 
Force Base in Virginia, refused to confirm the pilots' reports and said he had 
instructed his airmen not to discuss any contact with Iraqi jets. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get into our encounters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McBroom did say he considers U.S. air power here far superior to Iraq's. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not over here to go to war," McBroom said, "but we will finish one 
quickly in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Another officer in the unit and several crew chiefs said there have been 
several instances in which weapons systems aboard U.S. F-15s locked onto the 
Iraqis' French-made Mirage jets. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the radar locks on," one 
crew chief said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock on, they're 
gone," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Asked again about the encounters, McBroom said: "All I'll do is remind you our 
radar can lock on at a pretty good range. Beyond that you'll have to ask the 
Iraqis." 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to be suggesting that the episodes involved Iraqi planes flying well 
within Kuwaiti airspace. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said he had asked 
military officials about the report but had received no information that would 
enable him to confirm or deny the accuracy of the crew chiefs' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
McBroom said the fighter unit felt somewhat vulnerable on the ground when it 
arrived last week. But now it has received powerful ground protection from 
other U.S. forces, including Patriot ground-to-air missile systems. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has set up camp at a Saudi air base. It uses spare Saudi hangars, 
maintenance garages and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ground rules for the pool of U.S. reporters flown here by the Pentagon prohibit 
disclosure of the base's location, the number of planes and other weapons 
systems or the names of non-command officers. 
</P>
<P>
The men are living in Saudi barracks and schools. But a tent city is under 
construction on the base, as is a portable hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Heat is a big problem. The hospital is treating about 15 cases of heat stress a 
day, Air Force officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with the airmen were conducted between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. local 
time, when temperatures already were approaching triple digits and the sun was 
scorching. 
</P>
<P>
One Air Force sergeant was taken to the hospital during the pool's visit for a 
minor case of heat stress. He had been swinging a sledge hammer for several 
hours helping to set up the tents. 
</P>
<P>
McBroom said the Saudi base facilities are the best he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis build everything big and everything right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McBroom and his crew chiefs and maintenance personnel said they have had very 
few equipment problems associated with the heat. Most of the planes are being 
kept outdoors in the heat because electronic systems sometimes have temporary 
troubles when going from a cool to hot environment, McBroom said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has extensive stocks of missiles for the jets, and crews were 
seen unloading boxes of 20-millimeter shells for their on-board guns as well.

For all the fear that Iraq is generating with its threat of using chemical 
weapons, the fact remains that the United States has a far larger and more 
potent supply of nerve and mustard gas at its disposal -- enough, by some 
estimates, to kill everyone in the world 5,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegate Stephen J. Ledogar reminded the 40-nation Geneva Disarmament 
Conference of this country's capabilities Thursday, when he repeated the U.S. 
position that it has the right to "respond in kind" if its troops are hit by 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the possibility of the United States turning its chemical weapons on the 
Iraqis remains remote, even if Iraq uses chemicals first. For one thing, world 
opinion likely would turn against a superpower that inflicted the torture of 
chemical weapons; for another, other weapons probably would work better. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than make their missile sites more difficult to operate (by disabling 
Iraqi troops with chemical weapons), blow them to smithereens," suggested 
Gordon Burke, senior policy analyst for EAI Corp., a defense-industry 
consulting firm. "That would get to the point much faster." 
</P>
<P>
Using chemical weapons is a decision that could be made only by the President. 
However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday that he "cannot conceive of 
a situation" in which the United States would use chemical weapons against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The world has viewed chemical weapons with particular horror since the Germans 
used mustard gas in World War I, killing 100,000 and causing 1.3 million 
casualties. Troops sometimes woke up in their foxholes to find that they were 
lying in pools of the viscous liquid, which causes terrible blisters when it 
touches skin, Burke said. Inhaled, it can blister the inside of the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Nerve agents, developed in the late 1930s, cause the entire nervous system to 
break down. A lethal dose of some types could fit on the point of a pin, and a 
liter jar could contain enough to kill a million people, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has been building its stockpile of chemical weapons for 
decades. Production was halted for 18 years after former President Richard M. 
Nixon declared a moratorium in 1969. President Ronald Reagan began pressing for 
a resumption early in his Administration, citing evidence that the Soviets were 
adding to their chemical arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
The United States acknowledges having about 25,000 tons of chemical weapons, a 
supply second only to that of the Soviet Union, which says that it has 50,000 
tons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed in June 
to begin dismantling the two countries' stockpiles, so that neither country 
will have more than 5,000 tons by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, America produced chemical weapons because it feared that "the 
Soviets might come roaring across Europe behind a cloud of chemicals," Burke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the United States' top priority was countering a superpower threat, 
chemical weapons also were becoming what analysts call "the poor man's nuclear 
arsenal" -- weapons available to any country with a petrochemical, fertilizer 
or pharmaceutical industry, according to a report by the Center for Defense 
Information in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is believed to have several thousand tons of chemical weapons, CIA 
Director William H. Webster told Congress in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
More frightening than the size of Iraq's arsenal is its inclination to use it. 
About 200 civilians died during the Iran-Iraq War when both sides used chemical 
weapons, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has used nerve gas against Kurdish 
rebels in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Iraq signed the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which 
banned first use of chemical weapons. The talks currently under way in Geneva 
are aimed at a global ban, but it probably will be years before a treaty is 
negotiated and signed.

WOMEN MARINES GEARING UP TO GO TO MIDEAST; 
</P>

DEPLOYMENT: THEY MAKE PLANS FOR THEIR CHILDREN, CARS, HUSBANDS, BILLS AND A

Women Marines at Camp Pendleton are scrambling to find a place for their 
children, get inoculations, sign wills, figure out how to handle bills and what 
to do with their cars -- all in preparation for possible deployment in the 
Persian Gulf area. 
</P>
<P>
"Women serving in roles that are going to be needed are preparing to go," said 
Capt. Rose-Ann Sgrignoli, a Camp Pendleton Marine Corps spokeswoman. "If her 
job is essential to the mission, she will be there." 
</P>
<P>
That has meant special hardships for some Marines. One Camp Pendleton-based 
Marine took her two mentally handicapped toddlers to stay with a sister in 
Florida in case she is called. Another made arrangements with an Oceanside day 
care center to have her husband pick up their children. And as U.S. military 
muscle gathers in the Middle East, women in such units as the First Force 
Service Support Group at Camp Pendleton are scurrying to get ready for possible 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they say, they will be ready should the time come. 
</P>
<P>
"My father didn't think I had it in me to complete Marine Corps training," said 
Cpl. Dawn Anderson, 24, "but I did it. And if my country needs me, I am ready." 
</P>
<P>
Women throughout the military face the same dilemma: They can carry a gun but 
they are not suppose to fight -- though they are allowed to defend themselves. 
Prohibited by law from actually fighting, women can work in a variety of 
non-combat positions, such as technicians, mechanics and doctors. During the 
invasion of Panama, however, American military women were reportedly fired upon 
and returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of all Marines, and those at Camp Pendleton, are women. The North San 
Diego County camp is home to about 36,000 Marines, but officials refused to 
reveal how many women were destined for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
At El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, spokesman Lt. Gene Browne said no women 
stationed at the air base were among troops sent so far to the Mideast. He said 
there are no current plans to train or ready any El Toro female Marines for 
deployment to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the military, the Navy has 140 female sailors aboard support 
vessels in the North Arabian Sea; of those, 34 are aboard the West Coast-based 
ammunition ship Flint, Navy officials said. Army officials, while unwilling to 
give actual numbers, confirm that they have sent women. And about 12% of the 
Air Force now deployed in the Middle East "is, in all probability, female," 
said Major Lou Figueroa, a spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, women make up almost 14% of the Air Force, and we have not made any 
exceptions over there," Figueroa said. "They do the same things they would 
normally do with their units." 
</P>
<P>
At Camp Pendleton, the tension is almost palpable. Public affairs officials 
have added extra phone lines. And to help busy parents, who are now putting in 
longer than usual shifts, two of the five on-base day care facilities at Camp 
Pendleton have lengthened their hours so they tend children until 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All Marines who are parents have already signed an agreement indicating that 
they have made provisions for their children, should they be deployed. In some 
cases, the other spouse or family members are on standby to take care of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, a Marine will not have much time and a fellow Marine will care 
for a colleague's child until family members arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Marine Corps, we take care of our own," Sgrignoli said. 
</P>
<P>
At the base, both men and women are trying to prepare their personal world so 
they can be uprooted at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the intent of the Marine Corps to preclude women from participating 
in Operation Desert Shield," Sgrignoli said. "In keeping with Marine Corps 
policy and operational concepts, the initial scheduled assault waves will not 
include women. However, as Marine Corps service support (personnel) are 
established and functioning ashore, women will serve alongside their male 
counterparts." 
</P>
<P>
And the strain of parents' preparations and deployments has begun to trickle 
down to the children of Marines, day care center operators in Oceanside say. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you explain to an 18-month-old? They don't understand," said Dorothy 
Baker, director of the Ivey Ranch Day Care Center. "One day they have a parent; 
the next day the parent is gone." 
</P>
<P>
At Ivey Ranch, teachers are planning to have children tie yellow ribbons on the 
walkway outside the facility. Teachers there cared for the two mentally 
handicapped toddlers whose mother abruptly took them to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Those little girls couldn't understand. I just hope it ends soon," Baker said. 
"The mother was just distraught." 
</P>
<P>
Women Marines, dubbed "WM's," who have endured the grueling 13-week boot camp, 
say they are prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any apprehensions whatsoever," one female 17-year veteran of the 
Marine Corps said. Her husband already has been deployed, she said, but she 
figures her 15-year-old son can fend for himself if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've put in as much time as I have, you don't hesitate when you have a 
call to arms." 
</P>
<P>
This woman, however, said she had, in fact, never been called to a combat area. 
</P>
<P>
One female officer, based at Twentynine Palms, said she was looking over her 
apartment, figuring out which of her possessions she might manage to pack along 
to the Middle East. Marines will heft a duffel bag, wear a pack and tote a 
carry-on bag, which can be filled with personal items. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike others, she was more open about her anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fear of the unknown. I don't think anyone goes to a situation like that 
facing a madman and says they are not going to be scared," said the 24-year-old 
officer, who requested anonymity. "It's just a natural fear -- one that a man 
or a woman would feel."

SOUTH AFRICA: ANC PLEADS WITH BLACKS TO 'STOP SLAUGHTERING ONE ANOTHER.' SIX 
KILLED IN ATTACK ON COMMUTER TRAIN. FIGHTING SPREADS TO SOWETO.

<P>
Nelson Mandela and President Frederik W. de Klerk, facing a serious challenge 
to their peace process, met Thursday to explore ways of ending ethnic clashes 
that have taken more than 150 lives since Monday in black townships near 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in Pretoria, Mandela's African National Congress issued an 
impassioned plea for blacks to "stop slaughtering one another" because "every 
black life lost prolongs the period of our suffering." 
</P>
<P>
The killing, which began with clashes between Zulus and Xhosas in three 
townships southeast of Johannesburg, spread Thursday to Soweto, South Africa's 
largest black township. Scores of men armed with machetes and knives attacked a 
commuter train and killed six people. 
</P>
<P>
Later, mobs carrying weapons ranging from axes to AK-47 rifles rampaged through 
Soweto's streets, and the day's death toll rose to at least 10. More than 120 
were injured. Hundreds of police officers and army troops sought to impose 
themselves between the warring factions, using tear gas and shotguns to break 
up the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the police designated a bridge as no-man's-land between two angry 
mobs as civic leaders held impromptu peace talks. The groups dispersed, but 
scattered confrontations erupted throughout the day in Soweto, a township of 
2.2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frightening, I've never seen anything like it," Belede Mazwai, a Xhosa 
mother of three, said Thursday night as a gang of Zulus with guns and spears 
ran past her home in a middle-class section of Soweto. "I just want out of this 
place. The whole thing is collapsing." 
</P>
<P>
Soweto police were inundated with calls from worried residents Thursday night, 
and a police dispatcher told many callers that he did not have enough officers 
to send to their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and a regional police 
commander met in Soweto with Mandela and a delegation of residents in an effort 
to halt the violence. There was no indication that any specific measures were 
discussed or whether any plan had emerged from the earlier meeting between 
Mandela and De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain we're going to curb this violence," Brigadier Leon Mellet, 
spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, said in a televised interview. "We're 
getting more men on the ground, but we need to get the warring parties together 
so we can end this violence." 
</P>
<P>
Mellet said the police believe that the week's trouble began with "a simple 
fight" in a men's hostel in Tokoza township, where a Zulu resident killed a 
Xhosa over a woman. Then, he said, ethnic animosities, rarely seen in urban 
centers, were stirred by rumors, leading to violence. 
</P>
<P>
The escalating unrest has presented a major challenge to the government as well 
as the ANC and its rival, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha 
movement. Although the ANC is a multiracial organization, Mandela is a Xhosa 
and the ANC is perceived by some to be led primarily by Xhosas. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi blames the trouble on Mandela's refusal to meet with him. The ANC 
says the violence has been caused by attempts by Buthelezi's Inkatha movement 
to force non-Zulus to join its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say the fighting is an outgrowth of three years of clashes 
between supporters of Inkatha and the ANC in Buthelezi's home base of Natal 
Province. More than 3,000 people have died in that feud, which has most 
frequently been a battle over scarce resources between middle-class blacks who 
support the ANC and those in squalid squatter settlements who support Inkatha. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the fighting in Johannesburg-area townships has started in 
poverty-stricken squatter camps and overcrowded hostels, to which tens of 
thousands of single men, many of them Zulus, have moved from rural areas in 
search of work in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the far-right Conservative Party said Thursday that the fighting 
supports their theory that ethnic groups in South Africa cannot live together 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Thursday, the ANC pleaded for calm in the townships. It said 
that "the blood of black people is flowing like rivers." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do we butcher one another like beasts?" the ANC asked. It blamed the 
trouble on "a few misguided individuals calling on us to fight against one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC noted that, although blacks have political differences, speak different 
languages and come from different parts of the country, they should unite in 
their desire for better education, housing and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We can and must debate, yes," the ANC said. "But butchering one another will 
not take anyone anywhere."

JEWELER LINKED TO NORIEGA GETS 10 YEARS IN DRUG-SMUGGLING PLOT

<P>
A Panamanian jeweler charged with Manuel A. Noriega in a marijuana-trafficking 
scheme was sentenced Thursday to up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique A. (Kiki) Pretelt admitted last month that he had conspired with 
Noriega to take bribes from Tampa-based drug smugglers to help ferry 
$300-million worth of Colombian marijuana through Panama and hide the profits. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Castagna set a special status on Pretelt's term 
that would enable him to be freed on parole at any time. The judge told him to 
come back after he testifies in Noriega's drug-racketeering case in a separate 
indictment in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
A federal prosecutor from Miami told Castagna that Pretelt has been cooperating 
in the Noriega case and is expected to be an important witness in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, in prison outside of Miami, is accused in a February, 1988, indictment 
of taking $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn 
Panama into a way station for U.S.-bound drugs. The trial of the former 
Panamanian leader has been delayed until at least January. 
</P>
<P>
Pretelt's attorney, George Tragos, said Pretelt is likely to be the 
government's "big gun." 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the best witness the government has," Tragos said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Pretelt was a legitimate, well-respected businessman who, with the 
exception of this case, was "clean as a whistle." 
</P>
<P>
Pretelt, 47, promised to cooperate fully and agreed to forfeit $108,000 -- the 
amount he received for his part in the transactions, Tragos said. 
</P>
<P>
Pretelt pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money in one drug deal and to 
aiding a second marijuana-smuggling attempt by making arrangements to relabel a 
shipment from Colombia as being of Panamanian origin. 
</P>
<P>
He could have been sentenced to a 20-year prison term.

The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir Thursday said that all Western hostages 
held in Lebanon, including six Americans, will be freed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In a front-page report, the pro-Syrian newspaper quoted well-informed 
diplomatic sources as saying "secret contacts . . . involving the concerned 
capitals, particularly Tehran," were under way to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the captives are believed to be held by Shiite Muslim extremists 
operating under the umbrella of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Shiite Muslim leader on Thursday said he thinks that no 
American hostage in Lebanon will be released soon because of U.S. military 
intervention in the Persian Gulf -- but that European hostages may be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a demarcation line between American and European hostages," 
said Hussein Moussawi, who heads the Islamic Amal wing of Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the American occupation of Saudi Arabia leaves no chance for an early 
release of the American captives. But there is a chance the case of the 
European hostages might shortly ease up." 
</P>
<P>
He said the outlook for the European captives was brighter because France has 
taken an independent stance from the United States in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Moussawi also cited French President Francois Mitterrand's decision to release 
Anis Naccache, a Lebanese serving life for trying to assassinate former Iranian 
Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris in 1980, as a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision . . . is , I think, highly appreciated by Islamic groups holding 
the hostages. The Europeans (being held) might benefit from that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 12 Western hostages being held by extremist Muslim groups in Lebanon, 
including three Britons and six Americans. Most have been held three years or 
more. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for 
the Associated Press, who was kidnaped March 16, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
A British Embassy source would only say that there was "no knowledge of any 
breakthrough" and that "we cannot confirm the report by As-Safir." 
</P>
<P>
The As-Safir report quoted the unnamed sources as saying they "expect positive 
developments in the coming few days related to the fate of the Western hostages 
held in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the hostages, as a result of the developments in the Gulf region, 
has been put on a very hot burner," they said. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage takers have made various demands for the release of prisoners held 
by Israel in southern Lebanon, as well as convicted terrorists jailed in Kuwait 
and in Western capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has refused to free hundreds of inmates held on suspicion of involvement 
in attacks against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, there has been no firm word on the 
fate of 15 Shiite prisoners whose release had been demanded by the kidnapers in 
return for American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the prisoners were serving long jail terms and three were awaiting 
execution for involvement in a 1983 bombing spree against the U.S. and French 
embassies and Kuwaiti installations. 
</P>
<P>
As-Safir also said that the release of Swiss Red Cross orthopedic technician, 
Elio Erriquez, on Sunday was part of the deal being worked out for an end to 
the issue.

GINGRICH URGES TAX CUTS TO AVOID RECESSION

Breaking again with President Bush and other budget negotiators, House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) called Thursday for big tax cuts instead of tax 
increases to stimulate the economy and avoid a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"My individual belief is that we ought to look at a broad collection of tax 
cuts," Gingrich said in a telephone interview from his congressional office in 
Newnan, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my individual belief that we ought to look at a fairly wide range of tax 
cuts that help the American family, that help home buying and that help job 
creation." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came roughly two months after Bush broke his "read my lips -- no 
new taxes" campaign pledge and called for higher taxes to help cut the deficit. 
Gingrich and other Republicans broke with Bush over the tax issue and House 
Republicans passed a resolution opposing any tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's comments also came three weeks before the White House-congressional 
budget talks are scheduled to resume during the first week of September. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators have given themselves an unofficial deadline of Sept. 10 to reach 
agreement on a deficit reduction package.

A jury in its eighth day of deliberations heard doctors and two of three youths 
on trial describe how a female jogger was nearly beaten to death during a gang 
rape in Central Park last year. Descriptions of her critical injuries and the 
gruesome way they were inflicted were contained in testimony read back at the 
request of the jury trying to reach a verdict on the attempted murder count. 
</P>
<P>
Antron McCray, 16, Yusef Salaam, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, are on trial on 
13 criminal counts -- including rape and attempted murder. They are accused of 
being part of a gang of up to 30 youths that rampaged through the moonlit park 
during a random crime spree on April 19, 1989.

<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating whether its decision to 
grant a full-power license for the Seabrook nuclear power plant was "corruptly 
induced," agency documents say. 
</P>
<P>
An Aug. 7 memo said the NRC inspector general's office was interviewing staff 
members about Nov. 9, 1989, rulings by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. 
The board recommended that the plant in Seabrook, N.H., receive a full-power 
license and it approved evacuation plans. The action came just two days after 
an NRC appeals board said it found four problem areas with the previously 
approved evacuation plans. The NRC licensing board then ruled the four areas 
not to be a problem.

A man shot and wounded his wife and barricaded himself in his home with his 
3-year-old son Thursday, then surrendered to police after a brief volley of 
gunfire, a police official said. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Mulkey, 32, held his son in the three-story apartment building for four 
hours, police commander James Fruin said. 
</P>
<P>
Fruin said Mulkey, also known as John Polache, shot his common-law wife during 
a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Potter, 29, was taken to Illinois Masonic Hospital with a wound to her 
left arm and was in good condition, Fruin said. Their son, Dillon Mulkey, was 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 4:45 a.m., police said. Mulkey fired several shots at 
police surrounding the apartment building before he surrendered about 9 a.m. No 
one was hit by the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Mulkey faces charges of aggravated burglary and aggravated assault, Fruin said.

<P>
Sauntering out of the Ohio Bell Telephone Co. headquarters at lunchtime, a 
middle-aged man was greeted the other day by a familiar sight: 25 or so 
chanting demonstrators marching in a circle in front of the building. "This is 
becoming a Friday ritual," he said, stopping for a while to watch with a friend 
before moving on. 
</P>
<P>
The well-behaved demonstrators, who also have regularly targeted other downtown 
sites since their protest began June 29, are mostly Cleveland State University 
students. In what some are calling one of the longest campus protests since the 
1960s, black students at the university are campaigning for the reinstatement 
of a black university vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The firing of Raymond A. Winbush last June, 10 months after he started his job, 
has galvanized the black community in Cleveland as have few other controversies 
in recent years, in part because Winbush was hired in direct response to 
charges of racism at the state-supported university. 
</P>
<P>
As vice president for minority affairs and human relations, he was supposed to 
help resolve racial tension. Now his firing has sparked an even louder uproar 
that echoes growing racial tensions on college campuses across the country. It 
also has generated a communitywide debate over what the role of the 25-year-old 
"urban" university should be. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, some say, was Winbush's aggressive and sometimes confrontational 
style in dealing with racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He was brought here to do his job and he did an excellent job, but they didn't 
like the way he did it," said Gloria Rice, the mother of one of the student 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that University President John A. Flower did not want to seriously 
address racial concerns, student protest leader Dante Merriweather said: "He 
wanted a Tom in the job. He thought he bought one." 
</P>
<P>
Merriweather, backed by area ministers and political leaders and a growing 
number of national civil rights figures, vowed that the demonstrations would 
continue until Winbush is reinstated. Martin Luther King III, son of the slain 
civil rights leader, recently came to campus to lend moral support to the 
students. He was preceded the previous week by Joseph Lowery, head of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Protesters said they expect other 
national civil rights leaders to lend their support in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Flower, in the face of this mounting pressure, vows that Winbush will never 
be rehired. Flower has rebuffed efforts by outside parties, including the U.S. 
Justice Department and the mayor's office, to mediate the issue. Differing 
styles, he said, is not the issue -- "the issue is performance." 
</P>
<P>
Winbush's position was created three years ago after then-City Council 
President George Forbes charged the university with racism, and a U.S. Labor 
Department investigation had found that some black employees at the university 
were victims of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush was hired away from Vanderbilt University, where he was director of the 
black cultural center. His problems began almost immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush said he should have known there would be problems when Flower wrote him 
a letter before he began his Cleveland job that said in part: "We must be 
careful not to let the misperception emerge that you are the black community's 
instrument to get a bigger piece of CSU." 
</P>
<P>
Winbush and his supporters contend that, since blacks and Latinos are 
inequitably represented in the student body and work force at the university, a 
"bigger piece of CSU" is exactly what they need. 
</P>
<P>
"That statement alone has outraged the black community," Winbush said. "It sent 
a shock wave through me when I read it . . . . We could triple, in fact we 
could quadruple, the rate of black graduates and still be just at the national 
average." 
</P>
<P>
Winbush was asked by trustees to prepare a report on minority student retention 
rates and goals. When it was completed in November, Flower criticized it as 
inadequate, inaccurate and polemical, and he extensively edited it before 
turning it over to the board of trustees. Winbush and his supporters contend 
that Flower wanted to water it down. 
</P>
<P>
According to the university, 16.1% of the 18,535 students are members of 
minority groups and 11.6% of that number are black, making Cleveland State 
second in Ohio only to a traditionally black school in minority enrollment 
among public universities. Flower said minority enrollment increased 5.9% from 
the 1986-87 school year to September, 1989. In addition, the university says 
minorities are 16.3% of the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush and his supporters contend, however, that the university's figures are 
inflated. He also said the retention rate for black students is low, arguing 
that, although blacks were 10.7% of the 1986 enrollment, they were only 6.3% of 
the graduating class. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the university's figures are accurate, Winbush and his supporters 
argue that Cleveland State, as an urban university with open enrollment 
policies, should strive to more closely approximate the population of the city. 
Cleveland's population is 52% black and the county is about 30% black. 
</P>
<P>
Flower contends that "no one has tried harder than I have to work with the 
various minority communities here in Cleveland to help improve their 
participation here at CSU. We want blacks to have more opportunity at CSU." 
</P>
<P>
Flower stresses, though, that when he refers to minorities he means Cleveland's 
large Eastern European community as well as blacks, Latinos, women and the 
handicapped. And, although the university is "part and parcel of Cleveland and 
the Greater Cleveland area, at the same time we have to strive to maintain . . 
. the integrity of what the university is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That means, in essence, that the university has to protect itself in some 
measure from the pressures exerted upon it by minority groups, the Legislature, 
the business community and others "who justifiably perceive themselves as 
having a vested interest in the university," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush's main problem, Flower said, was that he was "not functioning within 
the ground rules" so necessary to running a large organization. 
</P>
<P>
Students continue to hold protest marches at businesses owned by members of the 
university board of trustees. And a 24-hour sit-in has continued since June 
29th. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven protesters were arrested for entering Tower City Center, the 
city's new showcase retail development downtown that is managed by a company 
headed by a Cleveland State trustee. 
</P>
<P>
But as campus protests go, this one is particularly well-behaved. The 30 to 50 
students staging a sit-in at the administration building -- now in its sixth 
week -- are attended by a contingent of lawyers and an auxiliary group headed 
by parents, who bring meals and issue press releases. A schedule of events is 
distributed to the media weekly. 
</P>
<P>
The times, as somebody once said, are a'changing. But then, King's son, on his 
visit to campus last week, had a rejoinder: "History has a way of repeating 
itself . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with problems here," he told black students, "that we thought 
we had dealt with in the '60s."

GRAND JURY ACCUSES 7 OF LINKS TO ILLEGAL ALIEN SMUGGLING RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury Thursday indicted a Carlsbad motel operator, five Los 
Angeles men and a Mexican man on charges of running an alien-smuggling ring 
from a motel that helped whisk about 600 people per month to Santa Ana and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Travel Inn Motel, Bharat Thakkar, 28, of Carlsbad, was 
charged with conspiring to smuggle aliens and two counts of harboring aliens, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. George C. Aguilar said. Thakkar was released on $15,000 
bail, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
The six others, all of whom are in custody, were indicted on charges that 
ranged from conspiracy to transporting aliens, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
Each count in the four-count indictment carries up to five years in prison and 
a maximum $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Though prosecutors contend the scheme moved hundreds of people monthly, Aguilar 
said it was not large-scale. "It was a tedious but extensive operation" that 
involved "a few people in a van here, a few people in a car there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents had been watching the motel for about four months, even raiding 
it once in mid-May and finding 71 illegal aliens in two motel rooms, Aguilar 
said. The immigrants were charged $250 to $300 to go to "drop houses" in Santa 
Ana and Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Thakkar agreed to rent motel rooms to Leandro 
Duran-Correa, 45, of Los Angeles, and Rodrigo Pineda-Solorio, 32, of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Duran-Correa and two other Los Angeles men -- Jose Angel Hernandez-Amaya, 35, 
and Brigido Rios-Castro, 31 -- transported illegal immigrants from the 
U.S.-Mexican border, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
Another Los Angeles man, Ricardo Rodriguez-Hernandez, Angel Tenorio-Rojas, 27, 
of Morelos, Mexico, were charged with taking part in the conspiracy, according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Thakkar, Tenorio-Rojas and Pineda-Solorio were arrested Aug. 10, Aguilar said. 
Hernandez-Amaya, Duran-Correa and Rios-Castro were arrested Aug. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez-Hernandez is serving a misdemeanor sentence in Texas for an unrelated 
illegal immigration conviction, Aguilar said. He is scheduled to be arraigned 
in San Diego later this month.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
LUNGREN ACCUSED OF DOING ABOUT-FACE ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Thursday accused 
Republican opponent Dan Lungren of flip-flopping on the abortion rights issue 
in order to boost his chances in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
"He has changed his views on abortion to save the life of his political career 
and onlyfor that reason," said Smith, an abortion rights advocate, during a 
press conference in the lobby of the downtown Million Dollar Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint radio appearance this month, Lungren, a staunch abortion opponent, 
said that, because of society's lack of support for crime victims, he would 
support the right to abortion in cases of rape, incest or threat to the 
mother's life. While in Congress in 1987, Smith pointed out, Lungren 
co-sponsored a proposed "right to life" constitutional amendment that would 
have banned abortions, except in cases in which the mother's life was 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Lungren's camp issued a two-page statement blasting Smith for 
ducking a joint radio talk show appearance in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 
Lungren's statement made no mention of the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
When asked for further clarification, Lungren press spokesman Dave Puglia said 
that, as acongressman, Lungren voted consistently against public financing of 
abortions. Puglia said that the recent radio statement was nothing new, since 
Lungren has supported abortion in cases of rape or incest during Congressional 
floor debates. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how that squared with Lungren's co-sponsorship of the constitutional 
amendment, campaign manager Brian Lungren said, "Lungren's record is clear on 
the issue of abortion. There has never been any change. We have answered the 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Carroll, legislative director for the California Pro-Life Council, said 
Thursday that her organization has no problems with Lungren's stance. The 
council, she said, occasionally supports legislation that restricts abortions 
except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the mother's life. "We support 
what it is politically possible to get. . . . If you're out to save lives, you 
save as many as you could save. We have no doubts or qualms about Dan Lungren." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren has repeatedly sought to downplay the abortion issue, saying it takes 
up only a minuscule portion of the attorney general's time. Smith has countered 
that it could become a major issue at the state level if the U.S. Supreme Court 
eventually dilutes abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Smith stood beside a makeshift marquee that his 
campaign aides had altered to read, "The Two Dans." 
</P>
<P>
"It stars Dan Lungren, the quick-change artist," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The protagonist in this story has suddenly changed his view." 
</P>
<P>
Also speaking was California Abortion Rights Action League board member Joanie 
Parker, who said: "To trust Dan Lungren on abortion rights is like believing 
Saddam Hussein is spreading democracy through the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lungren campaign Thursday released the results of a poll 
conducted for Lungren between Aug. 2 and Aug. 9. Statewide, Lungren led Smith 
38% to 35%, with the poll having a three-point margin of error.

1 KILLED, 2 HURT IN SHOOTING AT WEST COVINA TRADE SCHOOL

A gunman shot three people in a West Covina vocational school Thursday, killing 
one and critically wounding another before escaping in a car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Vasquez, 36, a counselor at Northwest College, died of her wounds at 
Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Stanford, 27, of Rancho Cucamonga, also a counselor, was in critical 
condition at the hospital after undergoing surgery, West Covina police said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old male tutor was seriously wounded in the leg, investigators said. 
His identity was not available. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 5 p.m., the gunman walked into the school building at 2029 W. 
Garvey Ave. and asked for a female student by name, said Police Lt. Clint 
Collins. When told she was not there, he began firing with a handgun for no 
apparent reason, fatally wounding Vasquez, and shooting Stanford in the 
stomach, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just opened fire on the people in front of him," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
As he left the building, the gunman turned and shot the tutor outside, the 
lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the man fired at least five shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a speculative motive yet," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
However, investigators said they believe the assailant is the boyfriend of the 
woman student he asked for. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said detectives planned to go the suspected gunman's house Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the gunman ran to a car driven by another man, detectives 
said. They described the vehicle as a 1980 or 1981 "shiny, beige Oldsmobile 
with wire wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Marsha First, administrator at the school, which offers training in 
health-related fields, described Vasquez, who lived in West Covina, as "a 
lovely, lovely person."

ST. JOHN CLAIMS ALLEGEDLY STOLEN CASH WAS HER SALARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the money Juanita St. John allegedly stole from a city-funded Los 
Angeles-Africa trade task force was actually part of a $75,000 annual salary 
she drew out of the nonprofit agency, her lawyer contended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Victor Sherman said $110,000 of the $178,000 St. John is accused of 
taking from the task force was salary due her as executive director. The rest 
was spent on travel and other task force business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Licker said investigators have found nothing 
authorizing St. John to be paid more than about $40,000 per year. Licker said 
that St. John illegally drained task force accounts to pay loans and mortgages 
on her San Marino home. 
</P>
<P>
The salary dispute erupted at the beginning of a much-delayed Superior Court 
preliminary hearing to determine whether St. John will stand trial on five 
counts of felony grand theft and filing false state tax returns. St. John has 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the most serious of a series of legal battles for St. John, 58, a 
friend and former business partner of Mayor Tom Bradley. She headed Bradley's 
scandal-plagued Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations. 
</P>
<P>
St. John was acquitted in April on charges of failing to honor a city subpoena, 
but the city attorney has sued St. John to recover nearly $400,000 that his 
office contends was misspent. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman offered no evidence at Thursday's hearing before Judge David Doi that a 
$75,000 annual salary was approved by anyone other than St. John. Most of those 
who served on Bradley's advisory board for the task force have maintained that 
they knew nothing of St. John's salary or the group's finances. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman said he may call Bradley, who helped create the task force and pushed 
city funding to keep it alive, as a witness, presumably to back St. John's 
salary claims. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is the only person associated with the task force who has indicated 
that St. John's salary may have been as high as Sherman contends. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview under oath last year, Bradley told city auditors he recalled 
discussions that the executive director be paid $60,000 to $75,000, although he 
said he did not know St. John's salary. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor would not comment on St. John's 
salary or whether he had been subpoenaed. "The mayor will fully cooperate in 
all requests for information in the court proceedings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those testifying Thursday was UCLA Vice Chancellor Elwin Svenson, who 
helped negotiate a 1985 agreement for the university to provide payroll 
services and office space for the task force. Svenson said the mayor and St. 
John agreed to keep St. John's salary in the same range it had been when she 
was an employee of the university -- about $40,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly agreed what her salary would be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the courtroom debate over the salary, a leading City 
Hall critic of the task force reacted angrily to the notion that St. John might 
have collected a $75,000 annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't pay a police sergeant $75,000, and clearly we get more from him than 
we did from her," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "It was a boondoggle. It was 
a fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Several task force advisory board members testified Thursday that St. John was 
given a free hand in running the group's financial affairs, and was thought to 
be doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman also noted that St. John was allowed to set her own salary. "Is a 
$65,000 to $70,000 salary out of line?" he asked. "So you have a difference of 
opinion."

STATE SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW INVALIDATED METRO RAIL TAX PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The state Supreme Court has agreed to review a lower court ruling that threw 
out a commercial property tax plan to finance the first stages of the Los 
Angeles Metro Rail system. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the high court review, Dorothy Wolpert, a lawyer for the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District, called the lower court decision "a potential 
roadblock to public works projects throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
"If some public improvement which generally benefits the public confers a 
special benefit on property owners, those people ought to contribute a portion 
of their windfall," she said Thursday, after the high court agreed to review 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Justices Allen Broussard, David Eagleson, Joyce Kennard and Armand Arabian, the 
majority needed on the seven-member high court, voted to grant a hearing on the 
transit district's attempt to revive the tax. 
</P>
<P>
The action nullifies a 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling May 1 that the tax 
plan improperly singled out commercial property owners, both to pay the 
assessments and to votein any referendum repealing the tax. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, approved in 1985, would raise $130 million to build stations along the 
first 4.4 miles of the planned 18.6-mile subway line, from downtown Union 
Station to Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. Nearly $1 billion more for 
the first stage would be provided by the city, state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
Concluding that commercial property values near the rail line would be boosted 
by the construction, the district ordered a tax on owners according to the size 
of their parcels. The Los Angeles City Council approved the plan after 
requiring a tax exemption for all residential property. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, challenged by downtown property owners, was approved by Superior Court 
Judge Billy Mills but overturned by the appellate court, which said both the 
tax plan and the law authorizing it were invalid. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-0 appellate decision, Justice Lynn Compton said the transit district had 
no power under state law to exempt residential property from the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the Legislature possesses the power to exempt property from special 
taxation or local assessment," Compton said.

MURDER CHARGES LIKELY IN SHOOTING

Prosecutors are expected to file murder and assault charges today against two 
men arrested in the drive-by shooting death of a 12-year-old Santa Ana boy who 
happened on the scene of a drug deal gone awry, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Robert Helton said investigators recovered a .45-caliber handgun 
when they took Thomas Trung Nguyen 22, of Santa Ana and Minh Chi Nguyen, 19, of 
San Bernardino into custody. Both suspects are being held in Orange County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Sanchez Hernandez was fatally wounded late Tuesday as he and his 
16-year-old brother Gus walked to the corner of Wood and Myrtle streets in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
A short time earlier, two men in a white Nissan truck had allegedly attempted 
to buy drugs from someone on the corner. A dispute erupted and police and 
witnesses say several youths in the neighborhood hurled bottles at the truck. 
The truck sped off, but returned moments later. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said four shots were fired from the vehicle, one striking Hernandez 
in the head and another hitting a 17-year-old bystander in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours later, Westminster police stopped a truck matching the 
vehicle's description and took two teen-agers into custody. After questioning 
them and other witnesses, police later arrested the two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The central Santa Ana neighborhood where the shooting took place has seen a 
flood of drug activity despite heightened police patrols, said Lt. Robert 
Chavez. It is considered one of the city's "priority areas" for drug 
enforcement, Chavez said. But many of the dealers warn each other of 
approaching police patrols and have enlisted neighborhood youths to act as 
lookouts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say we have been really successful," Chavez said. "Soon after we 
arrest the dealers, they are back on the streets again." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old's death is the second drug-related homicide in the neighborhood 
in four months. In May, Celestino Morales Davila was accidently shot by a 
friend who was attempting to fire a warning shot to scare away a group of drug 
dealers. LILY ENG

<P>
As many as 5,000 people from across the nation and around the world are 
expected to attend the second annual Vietnam War veterans reunion at El Centro 
Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The event, sponsored by the Brothers of Vietnam, a La Habra-based organization, 
will be held from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will offer a host of activities and give 
veterans a chance to rekindle friendships with their former brothers in arms. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that we hope to find some partners we served with," said 
Larry Hughes, the group's commander. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment will be provided by a disc jockey playing music from the Vietnam 
War era and a live band that is scheduled to perform in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies for fallen comrades, Gold Star mothers, veterans, prisoners of war 
and those missing in action are planned. A special dedication will be held for 
Fullerton Police Officer and Vietnam War veteran Tommy De La Rosa, who was 
killed in the line of duty this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was apprehensive about doing anything like this. But (it is good) to be with 
brothers again and feel a love and brotherhood," said Dennis Seitz, the group's 
treasurer. Seitz was an Army infantryman in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Booths will be set up for games, raffles, food and the sale of pins, patches 
and T-shirts. Guest speakers, including local dignitaries, will address the 
crowd and make presentations to veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers of Vietnam meets on the first and third Wednesday of each month in the 
La Habra American Legion Hall at 209 E. Orange St. Members celebrate birthdays 
and schedule other social events. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said they mostly get together just to talk. "We have rap sessions about 
Vietnam. We're not political. We're just all veterans. We have a bond like we 
had in Vietnam. We help each other out come hell or high water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For information about Saturday's reunion or the Brothers of Vietnam, call 
Hughes at (714) 680-4106 or Seitz at (714) 529-5929. DAVID F. BURKE

RESIDENTS BACK PLAN TO CONTROL SPEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to put radar guns into the hands of citizens concerned about speeding 
along their neighborhood streets was strongly backed by planning commissioners 
and residents this week. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 residents attended the Planning Commission meeting Tuesday night to 
voice their support for the Neighborhood Speed Watch program, a city-backed 
proposal that would place radar and an electronic speed display board in 
communities with traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed by the program," said Planning Commissioner Howard Revie. 
"It's probably the best way to control speeding in San Clemente." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission unanimously supported the proposal, which city 
officials said should go before the City Council for approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood volunteers would be trained to use the radar guns and display 
boards placed in highly visible locations on residential streets. The 
volunteers would take down license plate numbers of speeders and send them to 
City Hall, which would then mail warning letters to the offenders. 
</P>
<P>
City officials emphasized that no citations will issued by either the city or 
the residents. 
</P>
<P>
Mehran Sepehri, a city traffic engineer, said the program will be relatively 
inexpensive, costing about $3,000 for equipment and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of the residents (Tuesday night) said they wanted us to buy more than 
one unit," Sepehri said. "I think we would want to wait and see how this one 
does." 
</P>
<P>
The traffic engineer and several police agencies say this is one of the first 
times they have heard of the program being used in California. The idea was 
brought over from Renton, Wash., by City Manager Michael W. Parness. 
</P>
<P>
Sepehri said several traffic engineers from other cities and private firms have 
contacted him about the Neighborhood Speed Watch since the program was 
publicized. FRANK MESSINA

BOYS CLUB DIRECTOR QUITS AFTER PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The executive director of the Buena Park Boys Club announced his resignation 
this week, less than a month after angry parents, athletes and children 
protested the dismissal of Bob Eastland, a 30-year employee of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Larson, who was hired 11 months ago to run the club, resigned Wednesday, 
according to John Leland, president of the board of directors. Leland declined 
to provide details about Larson's departure; he said, however, that the recent 
outcry over Eastland's dismissal played a part. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that there was a lot of misunderstanding as to what we were trying to 
do at the Boys Club," Leland said. "He (Larson) just felt it was best." 
</P>
<P>
Larson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board has offered Eastland another position which he has 
accepted. Eastland, acknowledged a popular employee, was given notice in June 
and told that his $40,000-a-year job had been eliminated because of a budget 
crunch. Eventually, he was offered another position at substantially less pay. 
</P>
<P>
Eastland's initial dismissal prompted about 120 protesters to picket the club 
last month. Parents whose children participate in a wheelchair-hockey program 
led the demonstration in an effort to reverse his dismissal. The protesters 
said they were afraid that the program and others run by Eastland also would be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Eastland said he was thrilled over the recent offer despite a $10,000 pay cut. 
"They are in financial trouble. Maybe as we get going, the salary will go up," 
he said, adding that the board told him he could apply for the executive 
director's job vacated by Larson. 
</P>
<P>
Since the issue over Eastland arose, two members of the board of directors have 
resigned. Trustee Donna Bagley has since returned. Priscilla Atkinson, 
assistant director of the Buena Park Chamber of Commerce, said that new 
obligations with the city's VISION 2010 committee have forced her to leave her 
post. 
</P>
<P>
The club is not expected to fill the executive director's post for several 
months, Leland said. LYNDA NATALI

A suspected burglar who was arrested with the help of a police dog died 
Thursday while being treated at a hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Martinez Taffola, 36, of Santa Ana died of "unknown causes" about 3:30 
a.m. at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, Police Lt. Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary autopsy revealed that Taffola, who was "extremely violent" when 
police encountered him, tested positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy also revealed no injuries that could have caused his death, Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Taffola was arrested by police after they received several reports of a burglar 
prowling around a house on the 1300 block of West Saint Andrews Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Taffola on the grounds of nearby Sepulveda Elementary School when 
they went to investigate. When officers attempted to question Taffola, he 
became violent and had to be subdued, Helton said. A canine unit was called in 
to help in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, Taffola lapsed into unconsciousness and died while being 
treated for dog bites and minor scrapes and bruises.

WOMAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING RELEASED

<P>
A 49-year-old Newport Beach woman arrested Tuesday in the shooting death of her 
estranged husband was released from jail Thursday after prosecutors declined to 
file homicide charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Susan Parser, who police said admitted firing the single gunshot that 
killed Roger Hughes, 42, of Long Beach, was released from custody when the 
Orange County district attorney's office concluded there was not enough 
evidence to prosecute her. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said law enforcement officials are 
required by law to release suspects after two days in custody if charges are 
not filed. Newport Beach police said the investigation is continuing, however. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Parser at her Upper Newport Bay townhouse about 6:30 a.m. 
Tuesday. The fully clothed victim was found by police on the floor of an 
upstairs bedroom. Law enforcement officers believe Hughes was gunned down 
several hours before they were notified of the shooting by a friend of 
Parser's. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police said it was still unclear Thursday whether the couple's 
1984 marriage in Las Vegas was officially dissolved. They were not living 
together at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parser had bruises at the time of her arrest, police said after her 
release that the investigation "revealed that a questionable altercation 
between Parser and Hughes took place in the residence." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis Rosenblum said he refused to file charges because more 
evidence was needed to determine whether Parser was defending herself during a 
fight with Huges. 
</P>
<P>
"A man was shot and a woman obviously suffered some injuries," Rosenblum said, 
"and what we need to do is take a good, hard look to see if it was 
self-defense, if it was legal self-defense, and if there was some other motive 
for the killing." 
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, detectives learned that Hughes "had displayed 
violent tendencies on several occasions in the past," according to a police 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the files of the Pasadena Police Department, Gonis said, was an 
incident in which Hughes attacked Parser with a fireplace poker and she 
"defended herself by slashing him with a knife." Newport police said Hughes 
also had ignored a restraining order by telephoning her. 
</P>
<P>
After her release from jail, Parser appeared to be stunned by the events of the 
last few days. Bruises on her face and neck were thinly disguised by thick 
makeup she said she applied to hide the injuries. GEBE MARTINEZ

<P>
The value of nonresidential building permits was off 17% from last year for the 
first five months of the year, the most recent period for which information is 
available. There were some increases, though, in the five major building 
categories: the value of permits issued for both industrial buildings and 
stores increased from last year's totals. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how 1990's totals compare to 1989. Amounts are listed in thousands of 
dollars, not adjusted for inflation.

HOSPITAL WELCOMES BACK QUADS

Brianna, Jeffrey, Vincent and Whitney Miner are not alone. Not only do the four 
have the special bond of being quadruplets, but they also share the miracle of 
their lives with the more than 100 medical professionals who helped bring them 
into the world. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by pink and blue balloons and crepe paper, the infants celebrated 
six months of life Thursday at the hospital where they were born to Al and 
Karen Miner as a result of a new form of artificial insemination called GIFT -- 
Gamete Intra-Fallopian Transfer. They are the first quadruplets born in Orange 
County after use of this technique and only the second in California.167772160 
Dozens of nurses and doctors who helped deliver and care for the babies were on 
hand to cuddle the infants and share chocolate cake and fruit punch. They all 
displayed the same proud smiles as the parents -- cooing and gasping when the 
babies drooled or smiled. For the Miners, Thursday was just another day to 
enjoy their well-behaved family. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we just sit back and say, 'Can you believe it? Look how miraculous 
you guys are,' " said Karen Miner, a former elementary school teacher in 
Fullerton. She said the babies are even-tempered and do not cry very much. 
Indeed, they did not fuss much at all during their two-hour party at UCI 
Medical Center, though dozens of people held and played with them. 
</P>
<P>
Miner, 33, gave birth to the quadruplets Feb. 10, about eight weeks premature. 
She said they decided to celebrate the six-month mark a week late so Dr. Manuel 
Porto, who performed the Cesarean section on Miner, could attend. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of their birth, three of the babies were in good health. Jeffrey 
had fluid in his lungs and was on a respirator for four days. Now, Jeffrey is 
the second biggest of the bunch, Miner said, and growing stronger every day. 
</P>
<P>
When asked right after the birth how it felt to be the father of quadruplets, 
Al Miner responded, "I don't know if the reality has struck me yet. Ask me in 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
When asked Thursday, Al Miner said: "Actually, it's been relatively easy. Well, 
easy isn't the right word. The babies are very good babies -- as babies go." 
</P>
<P>
The GIFT technique has been used in Orange County for about three or four 
years, Porto said. The process involves placing sperm and unfertilized eggs in 
a woman's Fallopian tubes to let conception occur where it naturally would. 
</P>
<P>
Ten doctors and a team of about 100 were on hand when Miner delivered her 
children. Set up in four color-coded teams, the groups took care of the babies 
as each one was born. For some of them, the experience will always be special. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so natural and it is so rare," said Dr. Jack Sills, the neonatologist who 
cared for the children while they were in the hospital after their birth. "It's 
really special -- not only to be there when they are very ill but when they are 
like this. It is just wonderful." LUCY CHABOT

VIRAL INFECTION HOSPITALIZES MAYOR SHERIDAN

Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan was hospitalized this week after she complained of 
severe headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan's doctor said she is suffering from a viral infection and dehydration, 
City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, who was admitted Wednesday to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, is 
being given sedatives and heavy doses of antibiotics, he said. She is scheduled 
to undergo more tests today to determine the cause of her headaches. Sheridan 
is expected to remain in the hospital through the weekend, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, 55, said Thursday from the hospital that she had been feeling ill 
Tuesday but attended the City Council meeting anyway. The next morning, 
Sheridan said, she awoke with a severe headache and called her doctor, who 
later admitted her to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Her hospitalization forced her to miss a fund-raising reception Wednesday for 
the Irvine Barclay Theatre, a joint city-university theater nearly completed on 
the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor has not provided a release date from the hospital, but Sheridan said 
she hopes it will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of stuff to do," she said.

64 HOMELESS MEN SEIZED IN SANTA ANA POLICE SWEEP;

<P>
Leo Boyd was watching his buddies play a leisurely game of chess in the Civic 
Center on Wednesday afternoon when he unexpectedly found himself handcuffed, 
thrown into a police car and taken to nearby Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Once he was there, police officers scrawled a large red number on the 
frightened 19-year-old transient's forearm and chained him and 63 other 
homeless men to a bench for more than six hours. 
</P>
<P>
For his frustrating evening in custody, Boyd was handed a ticket for littering. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way I was littering," Boyd said. He and the other men were 
arrested in a police sweep that on Thursday drew criticism from immigration and 
legal rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"They just wanted to make us leave 'cause they don't want us around," said 
Boyd, as he sat in an office at the Legal Aid Society of Orange County. His arm 
still bore the large No. 3 that identified him during the roundup. 
</P>
<P>
City and police officials said the series of arrests that began at 4 p.m. was 
part of a new commitment to slow a reported increase in crime around the 
complex of courthouses and county and city offices. 
</P>
<P>
Other roundups of the hundreds of homeless men who live in the nooks and 
crannies around the Civic Center complex are to be expected in the future, 
Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did was appropriate," Walters said. "There are just so many things 
that have been happening in this area. We are getting a lot of complaints and 
letters." 
</P>
<P>
But legal rights and immigration advocates complained that this week's sweep 
unfairly targeted the homeless and will probably cause the Latino community to 
distrust the police. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen of those arrested were later determined to be illegal aliens and 
turned over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
All day Thursday, Legal Aid Society attorneys took statements and began 
preparing to fight the citations that were passed out to the men, said Robert 
J. Cohen, the clinic's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The men were released at 10:30 p.m. after police officers handed each of them a 
ticket for one of four infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Although some were ticketed for jaywalking, urinating in public and public 
drunkenness, the vast majority received tickets for littering. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the men were held on outstanding warrants, the rest were released with 
orders to appear in October to answer the citations. 
</P>
<P>
Legal rights activists said they are considering filing a class-action suit on 
behalf of the homeless men. 
</P>
<P>
"We as a legal community are personally outraged by it, and professionally we 
are going to do what we can to fight the city on this," said Justin Clouser, an 
attorney with the Poverty Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
Clouser also criticized the Police Department for drawing red numbers on the 
men's arms, comparing the action to the Nazi practice of tattooing numbers on 
concentration camp inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"These type of tactics are about 50 years out of date," Clouser said. "You 
cannot treat human beings like that." 
</P>
<P>
Several City Council members interviewed said that they were not informed of 
the police action. 
</P>
<P>
Although he criticized the police administration for not calling him before 
launching the series of arrests, Councilman John Acosta praised the department 
for rounding up the homeless men. 
</P>
<P>
"My constituents would just as soon wipe the slate clean of the homeless 
problem," Acosta said, adding that the homeless men who occupy the area create 
health hazards by urinating and defecating in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I know situations where there are truly homeless people, but these are 
vagrants, bums and panhandlers," Acosta said. "They don't truly want to help 
themselves. They absolutely don't want to stop begging, stealing and bumming 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said that police believe some of 
the homeless may be responsible for an increase in reported crime in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she said, there have been 86 thefts from cars and 22 stolen cars 
reported this year. She also said that reports of public drunkenness, vandalism 
and other crimes have risen dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"It was necessary to conduct this program because of the general rise in 
crime," she said. "It was not aimed at any group or individual or not directed 
to the homeless or the Hispanic community."

Reopening a debate that earned him widespread scorn among his legislative 
colleagues last year, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has introduced 
a resolution that states "it is simply untrue that Japanese-Americans were 
interned in concentration camps during World War II." 
</P>
<P>
The non-binding measure urges the Legislature to agree that relocation of the 
Japanese in California was not the result of racism but of military expediency 
based on the documented "existence of several thousand Japanese subversives" 
and on "acts of sabotage, espionage, and disloyalty by groups of Japanese 
nationals and European nationals on the West Coast, preceding and following the 
Pearl Harbor attack." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution is Ferguson's response to a resolution adopted over his 
objections last year that calls for California schoolchildren to be taught that 
the internment of 110,000 Japanese was a violation of human rights based on 
"race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-San Francisco), the measure was 
modeled on conclusions reached by a federal commission convened by former 
President Ronald Reagan, who signed a 1988 law officially apologizing for the 
wartime action. 
</P>
<P>
When the Speier measure came up for debate last August, Ferguson rose to his 
feet and admitted that the relocation was a "bad decision" but vigorously 
rebutting the charges of racism. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks ignited acrimonious debate, during which speakers called Ferguson's 
views "contemptible." 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, Ferguson has returned a year later with his own measure aimed at 
including his explanation for the internments. The measure at first denies any 
internment, but then points out that Canada, Mexico and nations in Central and 
South America instituted similar relocation programs. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution cites recently released, "top-secret Japanese military code 
messages broken by U.S. intelligence before and during the war which document 
that the Empire of Japan was counting on its nationals living in the United 
States and Japanese-Americans to assist in the war effort against America." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said Thursday that he sponsored his counter-resolution because he 
wants to make sure that California schoolchildren receive a "balanced" view of 
the reasons behind the Japanese internment. "If they want to say our families 
and fathers were racists, they have to include this, too," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Speier called Ferguson's resolution "absolutely preposterous" and said she 
would try to kill it in an Assembly committee before it gets to the floor for 
debate.

MIKE PENNER: HE'S BACK WHERE HE BELONGS

There is a rustling in the cornfield, a parting in the sea of green. There we 
find Augie Garrido, clad again in blue and orange, looking for something or 
someone -- probably a place to play or someone with deeper pockets than 
Shoeless Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath Garrido's feet, words appear: 
</P>
<P>
IF YOU BUILD IT, HE WILL COME. 
</P>
<P>
We are not hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
We are merely inspecting the planned cover art for the 1991 Cal State Fullerton 
baseball media guide. 
</P>
<P>
"It came to us while we were watching 'Field of Dreams' at a baseball camp," 
says Fullerton sports information director Mel Franks. "It hit us like a 
vision." 
</P>
<P>
Insidious movie, that "Field of Dreams." It drives people to a wide variety of 
bizarre behavior. Like praising it in public. 
</P>
<P>
But Garrido is cornfield-bound because, stranger still, he is Fullerton-bound. 
For Round II, against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
How can this be happening? How does Fullerton, a.k.a. Cal State Stepping Stone, 
shift an entire athletic history into reverse and reclaim a winning coach who 
once did what almost all winning coaches at Fullerton do -- leave? 
</P>
<P>
The Titans shoo coaches, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
Talk about comeback of the year. Garrido builds the Fullerton baseball program 
from the sandlot up, installs a lighted stadium, installs two NCAA 
championships, basically takes the Titans further than they ever had reason to 
expect -- and three years later, agrees to hitch up with Mission Impossible all 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
In a rough 12 months for Fullerton athletics, out of the blue comes a shining 
victory. Titan football players get their mug shots up on post office bulletin 
boards. The Fullerton basketball team, with Cedric Ceballos and three other 
returning starters, lands in the dumpster. Financial cutbacks nearly pull the 
plug on Dick Wolfe's nationally ranked men's gymnastics program. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Larry Cochell's Titans advance to the College World Series, they are 
ousted in two quick defeats, one by those perennial Beasts of the Southeast, 
the Bulldogs of The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
But Augie has returned. 
</P>
<P>
It's all right to be a Titan again. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three days, new university president Milton Gordon, Athletic 
Director Ed Carroll and assistant athletic director Steve DiTolla have been 
busy taking bows, probably justifiably. This was a public-relations triumph, 
for one and for all. 
</P>
<P>
For Gordon, the Garrido rehiring sends just the recommitment-to-sports message 
his office was seeking. For Carroll, it's a neat way to recoup the substantial 
loss of Cochell. And for DiTolla, the point man in the Garrido negotiations, 
it's an impressive shot in the resume for a young and rising athletic 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
But the main man in the operation was none other than Garrido. Fullerton may 
have wanted Augie but Augie, according to friends, wanted Fullerton even more. 
</P>
<P>
As a Californian coaching baseball at the University of Illinois, Garrido was 
in no-man's land. He was lured there by the man who hired him at Fullerton, 
Neale Stoner, then the athletic director at Illinois. Stoner was a man with a 
plan -- to turn this Big 10 football and basketball school onto baseball -- but 
soon, he was a man without a job. When Illinois football Coach John Mackovic 
replaced Stoner, Garrido lost not only a crucial ally but also the fight to 
keep his baseball program out of the minor sports division. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido won two Big 10 championships at Illinois. Friends came less easily. The 
other day, he recalled one of the first speeches he gave as Illini baseball 
coach, as the featured speaker at a prestigious fund-raising dinner. Not one 
person clapped when Garrido was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was perceived as a Stoner bobo, because he arrived with a six-figure 
salary and because he came across as a sun-tanned, slick-tongued Newport Beach 
hustler, Garrido ran into instant resentment in Champaign. It also snowed a lot 
in Champaign. That, Garrido resented. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the handwriting on the wall was in pencil; when Garrido's top 
assistant, Bill Kernan, left to become head coach at Cal State Northridge, 
Garrido was not permitted to replace him. The ink came later, when Garrido's 
three-year contract expired and Illinois requested he take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
Call it fortuitous timing. Garrido wanted out and when Cochell jumped from 
Fullerton to Oklahoma, he saw an opening. Fullerton only had to meet him 
halfway. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing too. Fullerton can barely afford halfway. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido will inherit some of his old problems -- not enough funds already 
raised -- and some new ones, too. Garrido's first two seasons back will be 
spent off-campus, at Amerige Park, while the hard hats complete assembly on 
Fullerton's $8 million multi-sports complex, which is to include a 1,500-seat 
baseball facility. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido will tackle it Augie style. Brightly, he notes that he has been pledged 
support in the fight for scholarships and equipment. Glancing at Amerige Park, 
he grins and bears it, claiming, "I love a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
A step in the right direction? Garrido can only hope. Inside the Fullerton 
athletic department, however, they already know. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask the average guy on the street in Northridge what he knows about Cal State 
Fullerton," Franks suggests, "He'll say, 'Good baseball team, Augie Garrido, 
Leon Wood and their football team never plays at home." 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much sums it up. 
</P>
<P>
Good to have Augie as part of the equation again.

EX-TITAN ABBOTT GIVEN TRYOUT WITH THE 49ERS

Former San Diego Chargers and Cal State Fullerton kicker Vince Abbott was given 
a tryout by the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday as the team continued to be 
concerned about the condition of kicker Mike Cofer. 
</P>
<P>
Cofer has been limited in his work by a pulled muscle in his left hip and is 
listed as probable for Monday night's game with Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at Abbott was just a precautionary measure," said John McVay, director 
of football operations. "We had former Minnesota kicker Chuck Nelson in 
Wednesday for a tryout and there is a possibility that we might sign one or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
McVay said the team wouldn't have to make up its mind about signing a kicker 
until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cofer insisted he should be ready to play against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"The muscle feels a lot better today than it has and I think I'll be able to 
kick," said Cofer, who missed Saturday night's game against the Raiders.

<TEXT>
<P>
Judy Barry cringes whenever she sees two women at an elegant black-tie affair 
wearing identical gowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed for them," Barry says. "I've seen women seated at the same 
table in matching dresses." 
</P>
<P>
Barry is so determined to avoid a similar fate, she designs her own glamorous 
gowns, traveling to Hong Kong to oversee production of her sequined sheaths. 
</P>
<P>
Her friends, seeing Barry show up at galas in one slinky, sparkling dress after 
another, commissioned her to make gowns for themselves. Barry, a Newport Beach 
resident, now sells her one-of-a-kind dresses under the name Judy Lee's Designs 
and Classic Editions. 
</P>
<P>
"No two gowns are alike," Barry says. "I don't like to see myself standing 
there across the room." 
</P>
<P>
Barry's gowns do have one thing in common: Every inch of fabric is doused in 
sequins, beads, rhinestones and pearls. 
</P>
<P>
Some dresses have three-inch drops of beads dangling from capped sleeves and 
hems. Others have beaded leaves or flowers appliqued around the shoulders, hem 
or bodice. 
</P>
<P>
Like Madonna in "Dick Tracy," women pour themselves into these breathless 
gowns. Barry has never designed anything with a full skirt or gathers. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be fairly thin," she admits. They're perfect for Barry, a tall, 
slender brunette. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her gowns accentuate the body with high slits, keyhole backs and low 
V-neck fronts. Some have scalloped borders around the neckline or hem. 
</P>
<P>
One off-the-shoulder gown has pink beaded flowers and painted silk leaves 
floating on a sea of pale peach sequins. A strapless royal blue sheath has 
swirls of emerald sequins and a scalloped edge bordering its diagonal hemline. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Barry's glitzy dresses are long. She designed a halter dress in a 
leopard print made of hand-painted silk and sequins that falls to the knees, 
with a simple bolero-style jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Barry began creating her Bob Mackie-style gowns five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I were going to a lot of black ties, and you really have to 
shop around a lot to find a gown that's different," she says. "Everywhere you 
go, you see the same dresses. They're all beautiful, but you know out of 400 
people someone will be wearing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
So began her search for affordable glitz. On a trip to Hong Kong with her 
mother, Barry discovered a shop that sold jars filled with beads. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured someone back home would be able to sew them on a dress. So I bought 
a 5-pound bag of every kind of bead in the shop and brought them back here." 
</P>
<P>
When her search for a tailor who did bead work proved futile, she hired a 
researcher to track down someone in Hong Kong who made beaded garments. The 
search led her to Paula Soo (her name, coincidentally, is pronounced sew). 
</P>
<P>
Soo worked with Barry to come up with designs for the dresses, then turned the 
sewing and beadwork over to a team of 75 to 100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought a couple of the gowns back and my friends said, 'This is wonderful 
-- can you do one for me?"' 
</P>
<P>
Barry now sends sketches of gowns to Soo, then meets with her in Hong Kong when 
the garments are half completed to position appliques on the dresses and make 
changes or alterations. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Barry had to steer Soo away from "Oriental-looking" designs. Mandarin 
collars and sequined dragons don't sell well in Orange County, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Barry also found that her initial desire to make gowns in solid colors didn't 
work -- the detail was lost and the dresses didn't sell. Eventually Soo and 
Barry hit upon the right formula -- colorful appliques or beaded patterns on a 
straight sheath. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic dress is the same, but then we add capped or long sleeves and beads 
that dangle or appliqued leaves." 
</P>
<P>
Customers can help design their dresses, choosing the style, colors and type of 
beaded appliques. The gowns cost from $450 for a short dress to $1,700 for an 
elaborate, long gown. 
</P>
<P>
While Barry doesn't call herself a designer, she has a knack for altering and 
improving the look of any garment. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I buy clothes, even if they're off the rack, they always go to the 
tailor," she says. "I usually change the collars and I always change the 
neckline and the buttons. I taper everything for a much more fitted look. 
</P>
<P>
"I own nothing with a flared skirt." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally her experiments with clothes lead to a new creation. 
</P>
<P>
"I always come up with these ideas I like, not knowing anyone else will like 
them too." 
</P>
<P>
That's how she invented her magnetic shoulder pads, which attach to the outside 
of a garment instead of the inside. Barry can turn a plain jacket into a 
Michael Jackson-style blazer by adding shoulder pads decorated with gold fringe 
and braid, or she can dress up a simple black chemise by attaching velvet 
shoulder pads draped with jet beads. 
</P>
<P>
To attach the pads without sticking pins through the garment, Barry decided to 
bury magnets inside each pad so it would cling to another magnetic shoulder pad 
worn underneath the garment. The pads have sold at Nordstrom and Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Barry's gowns have become so popular, she's trying to keep her "fun 
hobby" from turning into a full-blown business. 
</P>
<P>
Last year she made six trips to Hong Kong to pick up gowns. This year she wants 
to limit the number of trips to two or three. With each trip, she brings back 
25 to 30 gowns, shipping them in boxes because the sequins make them too heavy 
to carry. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get back from my trip people call and ask, 'When are you going to 
unpack?' I've never had a problem selling the gowns." 
</P>
<P>
For now, she's resisting the idea of selling her dresses through a department 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like knowing who my dresses go to," she says.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jill Bramlette's bodyboarding classes all begin with the same lesson: Be afraid 
of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when Bramlette asks her students, "Do you have any fear of the water?" the 
answer is a resounding, "No!" 
</P>
<P>
After all, these are adventurous 7- and 8-year-olds, mostly boys, strong 
swimmers who are fearless and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
That's why safety is the primary emphasis of Bramlette's classes, offered for 
the first time this summer by the Dana Point Harbor Youth and Group Facility. 
</P>
<P>
Bodyboarding, a simpler, easier alternative to riding a surfboard, has been 
around since the early 1970s, when former Laguna Beach resident Tom Morey 
developed the Boogie Board, a short polyethylene board that has become a 
popular beach plaything. Riders lie on the 4-foot-long boards, either straight 
with the wave or cutting across the wave's surface for more sophisticated 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
Today, every weekend you can see hundreds of bodyboarders riding the surf along 
the county's beaches. Many are children such as those in Bramlette's classes, 
for which the minimum age is 7. Participants must have their own equipment and 
be able to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen young bodyboarders sat on the grass near Doheny State Beach one recent 
weekend as Bramlette, longtime surfer and surf instructor, lectured them on the 
importance of respecting the power of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone told me they had no fear of the water," she said. "But the ocean is 
so powerful, it can really do some damage. You need to develop a healthy fear 
of it. A healthy respect." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important rules of bodyboarding, Bramlette said, is learning 
how to assess the ocean before you go out. Don't even think about doing a drop 
knee, stand up or el rollo -- all popular maneuvers -- until you have first 
thought about currents, tides, wave heights, sand bars and underwater rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine dove into the water and it was shallower than he thought and 
he broke his neck and now he is paralyzed," she said. "So you should always 
assess the situation before you go diving into it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important accessories a bodyboarder should have, Bramlette 
said, is a tide chart for the target area. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's high tide," she said, glancing at the ocean. "The waves are 
breaking close to shore. But what is usually out there?" 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a section of beach close to a jetty. Zack Hickle, 8, looked to 
where Bramlette was pointing and said, "Rocks." 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," she said. "They are covered with water now because it is high 
tide. But you need to know they're there." 
</P>
<P>
Bramlette cautioned her young students never to surf near piers, jetties or 
rocks, especially if there is a current. She also advised them not to venture 
out when conditions are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
When they do go out, she suggested that they have a lineup point on the beach 
so they can determine how currents are affecting them. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup point can be a lifeguard tower, a rock -- any fixed point on the 
land. "You know how your moms get mad if you go out and she says, 'Stay in 
front of me' and you end up down the beach somewhere? Well, think of your mom 
as your lineup point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bramlette also offers this advice: 
</P>
<P>
* Watch for other boards, other swimmers and other objects all the time. 
</P>
<P>
* Hold onto the board to keep it from hitting other swimmers. (Most boards are 
attached to the rider's wrist by a leash.) 
</P>
<P>
* Learn surfer etiquette. (For example, the surfer closest to the wave crest 
has the right of way.) 
</P>
<P>
* Always wear swim fins. 
</P>
<P>
* Always wear a waterproof sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
* Always keep your hands out in front to protect your head in a fall. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't panic. "Always keep yourself in control. Never do anything that is 
uncomfortable, and never go out alone. If you find yourself caught in a 6-foot 
wave set and it gets kind of scary out there, paddle out beyond it and wait. 
Then come in on a smaller wave set." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the content of the class is very basic, parents like Herb 
Hickle are grateful for the emphasis on safety. Hickle's sons, Zack, 8, and 
Tyler, 7, are both enrolled in the course. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of them have been rescued by the San Clemente lifeguards," Hickle said. 
"This class is wonderful for them. This is one of those sports that when 
parents stand back on the beach, it looks simple, but it is not as simple as it 
looks." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Spenuzza, who enrolled in the class with his 8-year-old son, Peter Jr., 
said, "We've both been doing this and needed to learn more about water safety, 
currents and all that." 
</P>
<P>
The class will be offered again Saturday and Aug. 25. For information, call 
(714) 661-7122. 
</P>
<P>
Sculling and rowing -- Have you always wanted to try sculling or rowing? The 
Newport Aquatic Center offers introductory clinics at 9 a.m. every Saturday. 
Cost is $5. For information, call (714) 646-7725. The center is at 1 
Whitecliffs Drive in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina cruising -- The Women's Ocean Racing Sailing Assn. will hold a cruise 
to Santa Catalina Island Aug. 24-26. The event is open to all members, friends 
and family, according to Shannon Aikman, president. For information, call (714) 
548-8755. 
</P>
<P>
Boating classes -- Two 13-week boating classes will be offered by Flotilla 15-4 
of the Coast Guard Auxiliary. A class for powerboaters will begin Sept. 12, one 
for sailboaters Sept. 13. Classes will meet from 7 to 9:30 p.m. at Tustin High 
School, 1171 E. Camino Real, Tustin. For information, call John Velasquez at

MASSEUSE RUBS SHOULDERS WITH -- AND OF -- STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

View.

Suzanne DeFranco reaches out and touches the stars on a daily basis. Naomi and 
Wynonna Judd, the royal family of Saudi Arabia, members of the band Little Feat 
and other heads of state, athletes and entertainers have benefited from the 
masseuse's educated touch. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a 'touch-deprived' society to start with," says the Laguna Niguel 
resident, who has been working as a masseuse for 14 years. "High technology of 
the '90s leaves little room, if any, for people-to-people contact. Computers, 
phones, fax machines all insulate us. 
</P>
<P>
"Add to that a very fast pace where appointment books have the say in what we 
do and the phrase 'We don't stop until we drop' becomes reality. Massage 
therapy by a licensed professional helps cope with the often overwhelming 
stress. It gives you time to drop everything, relax and listen to your bodies 
and spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Beauty shops and skin-care centers in Southern California report that massage 
appointments have tripled during the past year. Area health clubs have 
discovered that clients appreciate after-workout rubdowns to ease weary 
muscles, and physical therapists are offering a handful of healing massage 
methods. Even pregnant women are finding relief from back pain with special 
massage. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of massage centers has caused some confusion. It's sometimes 
difficult to distinguish the therapeutic massage centers from illicit 
establishments listed in the Yellow Pages. If an establishment discourages 
female clients, think twice about it. 
</P>
<P>
The most reliable selection method is to get a personal referral from a friend 
or health professional or to telephone the California Massage Therapy Assn. at 
(408) 365-7401 for the name of a member salon. 
</P>
<P>
DeFranco says people in the entertainment industry counteract the stress of 
traveling and performing with massage. Madonna, Sting and Bob Hope travel with 
a massage therapist. 
</P>
<P>
When the Judds, the singing mother-and-daughter country-Western duo, appeared 
at the Pacific Amphitheatre earlier this month, DeFranco greeted them again 
with open arms. She met them in Omaha last year. "I massaged Naomi Judd (the 
mother) right after a show, and we ended up talking until 2 in the morning," 
says DeFranco. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old masseuse met John Wayne through her father, who was one of 
Wayne's business partners, and she later traveled with Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
It was through this association that she recognized the special needs of 
high-profile, pressured people in the entertainment industry, sports and 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
DeFranco, who has lived in Orange County most of her life, traveled to Kona, 
Hawaii, in 1973 and met "Auntie Margaret," who taught Lomi-Lomi massage. 
</P>
<P>
"She was not supposed to teach this art outside of her Hawaiian culture," says 
DeFranco. "But she was a Christian and finally decided that this technique 
should be shared. She felt that people with loving hearts should be able to 
pass it on with their hands." 
</P>
<P>
DeFranco returned to the mainland fascinated with the art of massage and 
enrolled at the California Institute of Massage. There she learned basic 
Swedish massage, and she has since studied other massage styles. 
</P>
<P>
DeFranco stresses the importance of selecting a well-trained, licensed massage 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask if they've graduated from an accredited school, how many hours they've 
studied and if they belong to a national association for massage therapists," 
she says. "Be sure and ask for references." 
</P>
<P>
The more than 100,000 registered masseuses currently in the United States 
attest to massage's growing popularity.

MUSIC: THE O'KANES' FREEWHEELING APPROACH TO COUNTRY INCLUDES OCCASIONAL FREE 
VERSE. 'IT GOES BACK TO TRYING TO WRITE SOMETHING HONEST AND REAL,' KIERAN KANE 
SAYS. 'TRY TO USE WORDS YOU'D ACTUALLY SAY.'

<P>
Listening to the O'Kanes music is a lot like veering off a superhighway to 
explore some inviting side road that snakes its way through God's back yard. It 
carries you through breathtaking territory, and just when you expect to hit the 
main road again, the trail jags and leads instead to yet another eye-opening 
vista. 
</P>
<P>
Through three albums and a handful of Top 10 singles, the Nashville-based duo 
has established itself as one of the most arresting new talents country music 
has produced in the '80s. The unrelated O'Kanes -- Kieran Kane and Jamie O'Hara 
-- carry on the tradition of the brothers Louvin and Everly via songs that defy 
convention at every corner and vocals that resurrect the much-neglected genre 
of two-part male harmonizing. 
</P>
<P>
Their records -- from their debut 1986 single, the sprightly "Oh Darlin,' " to 
their most recent, the devastating breakup tale "Tell Me I Was Dreaming" -- 
feature a spare, mostly acoustic instrumental backing that spurns the 
superficial sheen and production weightiness other artists rely on to generate 
an illusion of substance. 
</P>
<P>
While admirers marvel at their ability to churn out appealing, genuinely felt 
songs largely without resorting to such tried-and-true country-music topics as 
lyin', cheatin', drinkin' and killin' -- often dispensing with such songwriting 
basics as rhyme -- the O'Kanes shrug it all off with characteristic humility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall us ever sitting down and articulating that: 'Let's avoid all 
cliche and let's avoid all expected routes,' " O'Hara, 39, said by phone from 
his home in Nashville during a few days' break in their 40-date national tour 
with Emmylou Harris, which stops Saturday at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think unconsciously, in both of our hearts, we want to try to stay away 
from cliche, to be as direct and simple and honest as we possibly can. In and 
of itself, that will direct you away from cliche," O'Hara said. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to trying to write something honest and real," said Kane, 40. 
"When we are writing songs and get to that point -- 'Where do we go from here?' 
-- we try to think about what would you actually say here? Forget about rhyme 
-- try to use words you'd actually say. 
</P>
<P>
"And we are usually able to craft it together that way. Most people don't 
notice (when lyrics) don't rhyme, if it rings true. It's fun to write like 
that. You're a lot freer to use language you may not be able to use otherwise, 
if you lock yourself into a rhyme scheme." 
</P>
<P>
Case in point of how the duo peels back truths while skirting predictability is 
found in "This Ain't Love" off their latest album, "Imagine That." 
</P>
<P>
 I think about you night and day 
</P>
<P>
 I need you by my side 
</P>
<P>
 I'm lonely when you're not around 
</P>
<P>
 I'm hollowed out inside 
</P>
<P>
 But this ain't love" 
</P>
<P>
 "That cut may be one of my favorite O'Kanes records of all time," Kane said. 
"It's classic O'Kanes. . . . It started out unintentionally -- we just had the 
guitar riff, then we began debunking all the myths (about love) in some way." 
</P>
<P>
Added O'Hara: "As it was taking shape, it became apparent the song was going to 
debunk cliches about how we define love. The deeper we got into that idea, the 
more and more I liked the song. In the creative process of songwriting, in the 
beginning it's best to stay away from trying to decide what you are trying 
decide before you do it. Try your best to see where you are being led, rather 
than where you want (the song) to go. . . . A lot of people misunderstand that 
song and get really confused by it. It takes a particular type of mentality to 
get it, and I think the reason I love that song is exactly that, because those 
particular ideas run so deep in our culture. We are just bombarded by it." 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds like a downcast view of love and romance, O'Hara doesn't intend 
it to be, and he resists the tag of "pessimistic country music" that one writer 
saddled them with. (The same writer, however, went on to say their music 
"nonetheless soothes and comforts the listener because it's so darn pretty and 
irresistible.") 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully the music is accurate; I don't know if it's pessimistic," O'Hara 
said. "To me, living is difficult for all of us. I don't think it's pessimistic 
to report on heartache. For myself, I know that I am comforted by a really 
accurate sad song, because it articulates for me the sadness that I feel. As a 
consequence I feel better. Sad songs make me feel good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think some of the O'Kanes' material is humorous, but I love songs like 
'Together Again' and 'I Fall to Pieces.' When I hear that kind of stuff, it's 
where I gravitate; when I hear that kind of wrenching soulfulness, I feel like, 
'Let's try to write that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kane once remarked that there is "a lonesomeness to me in the music, and even 
on the bright side there's underpinnings of sadness which goes back to the 
mountains, back to the Appalachians." 
</P>
<P>
It's a comment that begs the question: What can a couple of Northern boys -- 
one from Ohio, the other from New York -- know about the sadness born of life 
in the Appalachians? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people from a rural Southern mountain background have a corner 
on sadness and the blues," O'Hara said. "There's all kinds of poverty and all 
kinds of sadness. It cuts across all economic strands of society; north, west, 
south, east -- it doesn't matter. There are such things as poverty of the soul, 
of the heart, all those things, and I think that's what good country music gets 
at." 
</P>
<P>
The circuitous routes that brought Kane and O'Hara into country music, and 
ultimately to their partnership, may have something to do with their 
unconventional yet immediately accessible songwriting style. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being native sons of the South immersed from birth in country music 
traditions, as their sound might suggest, the O'Kanes were born and bred 
Yankees: O'Hara grew up in Toledo; Kane was born in Queens and reared in 
Upstate New York. Both cited rock 'n' roll as their first musical love, but at 
the same time remember being exposed to country music early on, when the line 
between rock and country wasn't as sharply drawn as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard country music," O'Hara said, "I didn't know I was hearing 
country. My older sisters would buy early Elvis and Jerry Lee records, and 
they'd bring home Everly Brothers songs. I remember Elvis' first Sun Records 
single, 'That's All Right, Mama,' and the flip side was (the Bill Monroe 
bluegrass standard) 'Blue Moon of Kentucky.' The flip side of Jerry Lee's 
'Great Balls of Fire' single was (the Hank Williams song) 'You Win Again.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably like Emmylou's experience -- I was not born into country music, 
but acquired a real appreciation for it as I grew older. . . . It's beautiful, 
soulful music when done properly. It's so direct; it can go right into your 
heart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Kane, there were two key events that redirected his focus from rock to 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up in Upstate New York, I heard a lot of country on the jukeboxes in 
the joints when I was a kid, hanging around cowboys," he said. "When I was 
about 12, my brother and I went to a hootenanny. We heard a bluegrass band and 
just went nuts. The next day he bought a banjo, I bought a mandolin. I had 
started out playing drums in a rock band, doing Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley stuff, 
but this bluegrass music turned my head around. 
</P>
<P>
"Then when I was 17, I went to a Bill Monroe concert and heard Buck Owens, who 
was opening for Monroe, and he turned my life around. Here was rock with 
country and mountain music -- everything I loved brought together." 
</P>
<P>
Though Kane spent eight years in Los Angeles trying to carve out a career, he 
moved to Nashville in the late '70s, where he took a job as a staff songwriter 
at Tree Music, one of country music's biggest publishing houses. 
</P>
<P>
There he met O'Hara, who had moved to Nashville to pursue a songwriting career 
not long after a knee injury ended the All-America high-school football star's 
NFL aspirations. Individually, they had penned hits for the Judds, Alabama, 
Ronnie McDowell. The two began collaborating on songs and after a while decided 
to take a stab at performing. 
</P>
<P>
Kane and O'Hara modeled themselves largely on singers who also wrote their own 
material, although O'Hara says he respects certain singers "who have the soul 
of a songwriter." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kane: "I think of country music as a singer-songwriter medium. Then there 
are the great singers: George Jones, Emmylou, Tammy Wynette. But the songs I 
always gravitated toward were the ones by people like Johnny Cash, Hank 
Williams, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, because they wrote their own music. When 
Buck came on the radio, there was no question who it was." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of transcendent individualism hasn't necessarily been the case 
recently. "Country went through a really dismal time (in the early '80s) when 
you could go down the charts and see that everything was produced and written 
by the same four or five people," Kane noted. "Everybody was indistinguishable 
from one another. Now you've got more people like Garth Brooks and Clint Black" 
who are writing their own songs and spawning more distinctly personal styles. 
</P>
<P>
That quality has been increasingly true of the O'Kanes sound to the extent that 
when they want to offer a song up for other performers to record, they find 
they can't record a demo tape themselves like they used to. 
</P>
<P>
"We still tend to pitch songs that I may write, or he writes, or we write 
together, that we just don't feel comfortable with ourselves," Kane said. "We 
can't record it with both of us singing, because then people ask, 'If it's such 
a good song, why don't they do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with their off-the-beaten-track style of songwriting, both members 
of the O'Kanes shy from typically cheery assessments of the future, possibly 
because the "Imagine That" album, despite being a creative step ahead of the 
previous two, was a commercial disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"When we finish touring in September," Kane said, "I don't have immediate plans 
for more touring. Who knows when we'll record again? We don't have a schedule. 
I'll just get back on the songwriting routine, which is pretty conducive 
because I can write at home, whenever I feel like it. . . . My main (objective) 
right now is finishing out the summer (tour), then sitting down and talking 
about what the hell do we do now?" 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara echoed the sense of uncertainty. "It's one album at a time. We made this 
album and we'll probably sit down soon and talk about whether we'll make 
another one."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: SMART CASH REGISTERS AND DUMB PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems to be some concern that as cash registers get smarter, the people 
behind them get less so. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers complain that clerks can't add up even two or three purchases without 
a register. A newspaper columnist writes of his encounter with a salesclerk who 
couldn't "do 10%" of $28.86 in her head. 
</P>
<P>
And a Los Angeles lawyer named George Schulman had to fight a McDonald's clerk 
and her manager over the proper charge for two "Happy Meals" with milkshakes 
substituted for the provided drinks. It was computed several times, with 
different results. "Maybe the register can't ring up something that's not 
already in the computer," says Schulman, "or maybe they were just unable to 
explain what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
The sagging capability of American workers is neither news nor limited to 
retail counters. Overall, "the rate of increase in productivity has dropped 
dramatically" in this country since the 1970s, said the recent report of the 
Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce. The commissioners, from 
both industry and government, blamed, among other things, the poor education 
and training of front-line workers, and the fact that management would rather 
turn to machines or offshore workers than train them. 
</P>
<P>
Our math skills in particular have been slipping. It has been reported that a 
quarter of American 13-year-olds don't understand basic math principles, that 
American eighth-graders scored 13th among 17 nations in math and that the 
average Japanese 12th-grader is better at math than the top 5% of American 
12th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The wonderful abilities of the machines further depress the operators' 
abilities. As Emerson wrote in 1841, "The civilized man has built a coach, but 
has lost the use of his feet." 
</P>
<P>
Plain old cash registers are often computer terminals connected to a company's 
mainframe. They do everything from registering sales to keeping track of 
inventory, leaving it to the employee just to punch in the item number, price, 
and amount tendered. Most machines even announce the correct change. "You don't 
need math to operate the machine," says Jim Cortese, spokesman for NCR 
(formerly National Cash Register) in Dayton, Ohio, "but you still have to count 
out the change." 
</P>
<P>
Many machines don't even demand item number and price. Fast-food stores with 
limited menus may have machines with buttons describing each item, which 
automatically ring up the price when pushed. Big stores with a wide range of 
goods have scanners which read a bar code; again, the machine supplies the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
With such machines, why should salespeople know math? Why, indeed, should 
children learn math procedures, wrote a New York math teacher (a teacher!) to 
Time magazine, "when a $4.95 calculator will do it more quickly and 
accurately?" 
</P>
<P>
Cortese's answer: "The issue is larger -- it's what learning those skills does 
to your brain, which needs software in it." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, these machines have real advantages, having been developed not to 
depress everyone's math skills but to automate retail sales procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"They enable us to take care of customers a lot quicker, which improves the 
level of service," says Rob Rohde, director of human resource planning and 
development for Sears Merchandise Group. 
</P>
<P>
Salespeople can spend more time helping customers on the sales floor. 
</P>
<P>
Machines also free people from the need to master certain skills. Many retail 
counter jobs are now open to the young, untrained, and uneducated. Fast-food 
restaurants, supermarkets and big merchandisers generally require neither proof 
nor exercise of arithmetic skills and in return, pay little. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, employees are freed to develop their abilities elsewhere, if still 
sales-directed. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to spend half a day on the arithmetic part of it -- how to figure out 
a discount, how to compute sales tax," says Jack Fraser, vice president for 
human resources at the National Retail Federation in New York. "Now retailers 
can spend it on customer service." 
</P>
<P>
"The register does everything now," says Aileen Gorman, spokesman for 
Boston-based Bradlees discount stores, which is installing scanners, along with 
a formal course in customer service for salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to do much thinking, but they do have to smile, to listen 
actively, to treat the customer with courtesy." 
</P>
<P>
Such civility training seems a limited enough goal, but even that is hardly 
widespread. Few managements even seem to be thinking of the new automation as 
offering benefits beyond better, faster sales processing. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find retailers using this freed-up time to train low-wage 
employees in anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a handful of our companies invest in training," said the Commission on 
the Skills of the American Workforce report, so low-paid workers are trapped in 
low-paid jobs. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard even to find retailers providing more customer service out on the 
floor: most just install computerized registers, cut their staffing, and save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Better machines make a better world, right?

INFLATION AT HOME, TENSION ABROAD SEND DOW DOWN 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market, which had lapsed into an edgy calm in recent days, was 
wrenched again Thursday by new warlike noises from Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein, and signs of mounting inflation and a weakening economy at home. 
</P>
<P>
In a last-minute selloff, the Dow Jones industrial index fell 66.83 points to 
2,681.44, a 2.4% drop on a light New York Stock Exchange trading volume of 
138.6 million shares, compared to 135.2 million on Wednesday. The fall followed 
two sessions in which the Dow had moved less than one point, and marked the 
index's lowest point since the Kuwaiti crisis began Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Saber-rattling has rattled the market," said Jonathan Groveman, head of equity 
trading for Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. in New York. "We went from a couple 
days of stabilization to more bad news. This market is riveted by what's going 
on over there." 
</P>
<P>
The market was also reacting to news that the inflation rate, as measured by 
the consumer price index, rose 0.4% last month. Another report showed that 
housing starts fell 2.6% last month to their lowest point since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
* Oil gained in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. September futures 
contracts jumped 90 cents a barrel to $27.36. 
</P>
<P>
* Gold continued its rise. Futures contracts for August added $6.60 to $409.20 
an ounce in New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
* Overseas stock markets also were hit. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index slid 562.68 
to 27,549.44 on Thursday and fell another 870.59 points, or 3.16%, to 26,678.85 
as of today's midday close. In Frankfurt, West Germany on Thursday, the DAX 
index gave up 14.7 to 1,727.45. A drop in the London market shaved 17.2 points 
off the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index, to 2222.1. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. stock indexes suffered with the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 
500-stock index fell 7.67 to 332.39. Over-the-counter markets also went head 
over heels, dropping the NASDAQ composite index 9.18 points, or 2.2%, to 
402.27. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered gainers 1,285 to 325 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Stock traders were troubled by several Mideast developments. In an "open 
letter" to President Bush, Iraq's Saddam Hussein spoke of "American deaths," 
and also ordered Britons and Americans in Kuwait to report to a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, it was clear that contrary to earlier hopes, King Hussein of 
Jordan was not carrying a message from Saddam Hussein to Bush. Earlier reports 
said the king would bring a proposal for a resolution of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
James Creber, partner in the New York investment firm of Miller Tabak Hirsch, 
said traders were looking Thursday at "a combination of stagflation at home, 
the costs of expensive military buildup over there and the prospect of war. 
It's a tough combination."

He said that in an effort to divine how the combination would affect the 
market, some traders were taking out market charts from 1973-1974, when the 
country was hit by the first oil crisis. The S&amp;P 500 index, the market 
gauge favored by money managers, dropped to 75 from 125 in that period, a 40% 
loss, Creber noted. 
</P>
<P>
"So you see things can really get pretty bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the Dow tumbled rapidly in the last half hour of trading and 
triggered one of the "circuit breaker" devices intended to provide time outs in 
disorderly markets. The fall meant that traders performing the kind of 
computer-directed trading called index arbitrage couldn't sell the stocks 
involved in those trades except when prices were rising. 
</P>
<P>
But the limits on programs didn't stop fearful money managers from bailing out, 
joining others who have exited the market since mid-July. The Dow now is off 
318 points, or 10.6%, from its all-time high of 2,999.75 on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* The stocks that were hit hardest were many of the growth stocks that 
investors had crept back into over the past week -- adding credence to the 
bears' view that even those stocks won't be able to hold onto any short-term 
gains. Merck plunged 4 1/8 to 83 3/4, Procter &amp; Gamble tumbled 2 7/8 to 80 
5/8, Philip Morris lost 2 to 45 1/4, Home Depot slumped 2 1/4 to 34 7/8 and 
Gillette dropped 3 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil and oil-related stocks were mixed. Mobil rose 1/4 to 66 3/4 and Arco 
gained 1 1/4 to 135, but Dresser Industries dropped 2 7/8 to 51 1/8 and 
Halliburton fell 3/4 to 55 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Gold stocks continued their rise, as ASA jumped 2 5/8 to 56 1/4 and Newmont 
Gold rose 1 1/8 to 54. 
</P>
<P>
* Security Pacific plunged 3 to 28 3/4. The company disclosed that its earnings 
in this year's second half would be lower than expected due to slower growth in 
non-interest income and an increase in provisions for loan losses. The increase 
in loan-loss provisions reflects a weaker economy and continuing real estate 
problems in Arizona, Australia and Great Britain, Security Pacific said. 
</P>
<P>
After the news, Merrill Lynch cuts its 1990 earnings estimate for the bank to 
$5.70 a share from $6.35, and its 1991 estimate to $6.20 from $6.80. 
</P>
<P>
The Security Pacific bomb helped send other California bank and real estate 
companies' stocks sharply lower. Wells Fargo slumped 3 1/8 to 59 5/8, Ahmanson 
fell 3/8 to 16 7/8 and First Interstate lost 1 3/8 to 31 1/4. Among home 
builders, Kaufman &amp; Broad dropped 3/8 to 7 1/2, Del Webb lost 1/2 to 6 1/4 
and Standard Pacific fell 3/8 to 7 5/8. Elsewhere, Hilton plunged 2 3/8 to 37 
5/8.

POWER GLITCH HOLDS UP FED TRANSFERS, GENERATES PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The communications system that is used to transfer billions of dollars between 
U.S. banks was disrupted Thursday by a glitch in a backup power generator that 
has been in use at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since a power outage 
struck Manhattan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The glitch forced the New York Fed to delay the opening of the so-called 
Fedwire, a step that drove up short-term interest rates and backed up the 
processing of big interbank transactions. The 2 1/2-hour delay also panicked 
dealers in government securities, whose transactions are completed through the 
computerized system and who also use it to arrange financing. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials were able to start up the system only by rerouting the flow of 
computer information through a backup system in Pearl River, N.Y., across the 
Hudson River and about 25 miles north of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The disruption was the second demonstration this week of the vulnerability of 
the nation's financial infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a fire in a Manhattan electrical station cut off power to much of 
Wall Street, halting trading at the American Stock Exchange and five New York 
futures and options exchanges, and curtailing market activity through much of 
the United States. It was that outage that forced the New York Fed to turn to 
the backup diesel generator. 
</P>
<P>
E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, said at an afternoon news 
briefing that the disruption was "Exhibit 'A' of the relevance and importance 
of the plumbing of the financial system." 
</P>
<P>
Although he sought to minimize the difficulties, he said the Fed was "not out 
of the woods yet." The transfer to a backup system is "incredibly complicated," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Fedwire has been called the central nervous system of the nation's banking 
system and functions somewhat like a trillion-dollar checking account run by 
the central bank. The primary electronic transfer system among banks, savings 
and loans, credit unions and U.S. government agencies, it handles about $900 
billion in financial transfers on an average day. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials were told Thursday morning of difficulties with the diesel 
generator and quickly decided to halt the usual 8:30 a.m. opening, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A failure poses the risk that records of billion-dollar transactions could be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Corrigan said the technical problems developed because the backup system had 
been working "full blast" since the Monday outage. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials spent the first hours of the morning consulting with officials of 
government and major banks, while technical personnel arranged changes in the 
computer protocols and software needed to reroute transactions through the 
Pearl River computer operation. Many banks also needed to reroute their 
computer connections. 
</P>
<P>
But as preparations were under way, some of the nation's banks couldn't wait 
for the opening to arrange overnight loans that they need to finance part of 
their assets. They began bidding up the overnight loans and raising the 
so-called federal funds rate to as much as 8.5% during the day from 8%. 
</P>
<P>
"That half-point doesn't seem like much, but it adds up," said Paul Kasriel, 
vice president and economist with Northern Trust Bank in Chicago. "At a time 
when a lot of banks are feeling earnings pressure, it'll hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials hope to return to the regular system this weekend.

JAPAN LOBBY CRITIC CHOATE OUT AT TRW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Choate, a leading critic of Americans who leave top government jobs to 
lobby for Japanese firms, has been forced to resign from TRW Inc. because of 
controversy over an upcoming book on the subject, friends said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Choate, a vocal trade commentator and policy analyst based in Washington, was 
told by TRW that his continued employment was untenable given the publication 
in October of "Agents of Influence," according to friends. The book is expected 
to examine how 200 former U.S. officials have taken jobs as lobbyists for 
foreign interests, primarily Japanese, and include details on payments made and 
secret agreements to hide the true source of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Choate has estimated that Japanese government agencies, corporations and 
foundations spent $150 million in 1988 and $250 million in 1989 on lobbying and 
other public relations efforts in the United States, far more than any other 
foreign nation. 
</P>
<P>
His supporters expressed concern Thursday that Choate's separation from TRW 
would have a chilling effect on other critics of foreign trade practices or 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
"If Pat was forced out, it means it's going to be very difficult for people who 
work for American companies to develop an independent viewpoint on U.S.-Japan 
trade," said John B. Judis, senior editor of a Chicago-based political journal, 
"In These Times." Judis wrote a widely publicized piece on Japanese lobbying, 
"Yen for Power," for the New Republic magazine earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
TRW, a maker of auto and defense-related products with headquarters in 
Cleveland, reportedly does $400 million in business a year with Japanese firms. 
TRW Space &amp; Defense Sector is based in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Makoto Kuroda, a retired official with the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, has acknowledged he raised the issue of Choate and his book with TRW 
President Joseph P. Gorman last year, but denied asking for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
One Japanese government official said it was "inconceivable" that pressure from 
Japan had led to Choate's departure. But he said many Japanese were deeply 
concerned that the book would worsen U.S.-Japan relations and that publication 
of it immediately prior to mid-term elections would give candidates cause to 
use Japan as a scapegoat in their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokesman Mike Johnson denied the firm had fired or forced Choate out of 
his job, and said his departure was "in no way" related to pressure from 
Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
"His leaving was a mutual agreement between Pat and TRW so that he could go off 
and write and lecture full time," Johnson said. TRW will retain him as a 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Choate declined comment. Friends, however, described him as stunned over the 
severance because the firm had known he was working on the book for the past 2 
1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles), who has worked closely with Choate on 
issues of U.S. industrial competitiveness, called his departure from TRW 
"perplexing" and "regrettable" and said Congress should look into it if there 
were evidence of foreign influence. 
</P>
<P>
"If he lost his job due to foreign influence . . . it illustrates what his book 
is all about," said Roger Hickey, vice president for communications of the 
Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington that favors more 
direct government efforts to help industry compete with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Choate, a Texas native who picked cotton on his father's farm, joined TRW in 
1981 as a vice president for policy analysis. A ubiquitous presence on talk 
shows and task forces, in hearings and news reports, Choate is regarded as a 
brilliant economist with a flair for transforming dense issues such as 
infrastructure into hot national topics. In the mid-1980s, he drew national 
attention to the issue of America's industrial competitiveness, with Ronald 
Reagan making it the center of his 1987 State of the Union Message. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in Choate's book is so high that its publisher, Alfred Knopf, has 
increased the first printing run from 20,000 copies to 50,000 copies. The 
Economic Policy Institute plans to hold a seminar on the book in Washington in 
October. In addition, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, is planning a hearing on 
foreign lobbying efforts this fall.

PEOPLE: CETUS' CHIEF QUITS AFTER FDA SPURNS KEY DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cetus Corp.'s outspoken president and chief executive, Robert A. Fildes, 
resigned Thursday, less than a month after a Food and Drug Administration panel 
recommended against approval of the company's crucial anti-cancer drug. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Ronald E. Cape, who relinquished the CEO title to Fildes in 1986, was 
again named to the post, the Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology company 
said in a statement. Also, Hollings C. Renton, chief operating officer, was 
given the additional title of president. Cetus also said it was reducing its 
work force by about 10% to cut costs, laying off about 100 of 950 people. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Fildes nor Cape was available for comment Thursday. Renton declined to 
elaborate on a company statement that said the resignation resulted from 
"differing views regarding the company's priorities." He acknowledged that the 
company is looking at strategic changes that would include forming more 
marketing and research alliances with others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said they believe that the delay in approval of 
Proleukin interleukin-2 was a major factor. "As head of the company, (Fildes) 
was ultimately responsible for overseeing the clinical strategy and oversight 
of regulatory affairs," said David Webber, a New York based-analyst with Alex. 
Brown &amp; Sons of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Cetus is one of the nation's oldest and best-known biotechnology companies, but 
it has been hemorrhaging red ink since 1987. And, in the years when it was on 
the plus side during the decade, it was barely profitable. It has focused much 
of its attention recently on drugs to fight cancer and infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. approval of interleukin-2 is "pivotal to getting Cetus to profitability," 
said analyst Margaret B. McGeorge of San Francisco-based Sutro &amp; Co. 
Although everyone knew that making the case for approval of interleukin-2 would 
be a challenge, many thought Cetus' presentation was nevertheless a 
"disappointment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cetus' drug has been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer only in 
Denmark and the Netherlands. The FDA panel recommended that the company conduct 
further studies to more specifically identify which patients would benefit from 
the highly toxic drug, which has serious side effects -- such as massive fluid 
retention -- that can lead to temporary heart or kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
Cetus' data showed that kidney tumors shrank to about half their normal size in 
about 15% of patients treated with the drug. In about 4% of the patients, the 
tumors disappeared altogether. But most of the treated patients showed no 
effect from treatment, and many suffered side effects. About 4% died of 
complications from the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Robert Kupor of New York-based Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. agreed that 
the FDA panel's decision hurt Fildes. And "his highly intemperate comments" 
accusing the FDA of bias against the company didn't help his case, Kupor said. 
However, he added, "his position was probably imperiled considerably before 
that because of the overall condition of the company, which the CEO must take 
responsibility for." 
</P>
<P>
Kupor said Fildes, a London-born research scientist who had held posts at other 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, was brought in, in 1982, to turn Cetus 
around at a time when it had a "dreadful reputation for slowness and 
unproductivity." It was inevitable that Fildes would leave after 8 years of 
little improvement, he added.

North Carolina Is Tops for Manufacturers: Low wages, few unions and modest 
unemployment benefits give North Carolina the best manufacturing climate among 
the nation's industrial states, according to a study of business costs. 
California ranked 22nd among the 29 industrialized states, according to 
Chicago-based accounting firm Grant Thornton. Michigan had the worst 
manufacturing climate, with the highest average hourly wages, the highest 
percentage of union workers and high rankings in unemployment and workers' 
compensation benefits.

U.S. TELECOM INDUSTRY LOSING MARKET SHARE

The U.S. telecommunications industry is still a world leader in high-tech 
products but sales of its low-end goods have fallen, causing a drop in the 
overall global market share, a Commerce Department report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The report demonstrates that the U.S. industry remains strong, but the 
long-term trends are not going in a positive direction," said Under Secretary 
of Commerce Michael Farren. 
</P>
<P>
Farren told a news conference that although private industry must take the lead 
to regain competitiveness, the government was doing its part to help. 
</P>
<P>
"In an industry as pivotal as telecommunications, U.S. companies must maintain 
their lead in the Pacific Rim, the New Europe and our own hemisphere," said 
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher in a statement issued with the report. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher called on industry to spend more on research and development, improve 
manufacturing technology and stress exports further. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government will do its part by aggressively pursuing measures to open 
markets in countries that erect unfair barriers," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The report, ordered by Congress, said U.S. producers will likely remain 
competitive in such high-end telecommunications as advanced switching and 
information services, but not in more basic telephone equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It said U.S. companies were disadvantaged compared to Japanese and some 
European companies because American workers lacked the needed education and 
training of their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The report added that foreign market barriers and state subsidies granted to 
some overseas companies created drawbacks for American firms trying to sell 
products abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the overall trade picture was mixed, citing both last year's 
export increases, which cut the telecommunications trade deficit by $673 
million, and the remaining substantial deficit of $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. market share in fiber optics fell to 50% in 1987 (the latest year 
available for detailed figures) from 75% in 1984, and in office data switching 
equipment to 36% from 100%, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
But in other areas, the United States held its ground. The report said the U.S. 
share in voice mail systems remained at 100% during the period and in local 
area telecommunications networks fell only 2% to 98%. 
</P>
<P>
The report said current Administration proposals that would help 
competitiveness include capital gains tax relief.

Bad inflation news from Washington and war words from Iraq's Saddam Hussein 
combined to wallop the bond market Thursday, jacking up interest rates and 
depressing prices sharply in nervous trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 1 23/32 points, or $17.19 per $1,000 in 
face amount. The bond's yield jumped to 8.92% from 8.76% late Wednesday. It was 
the highest yield since it flirted with 9% in early May. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the bond market's deterioration began early in the day when the 
Labor Department said the consumer price index for July rose 0.4%, considered 
an unexpectedly high increase. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last measurement of inflation prior to the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, which has sent oil prices sharply higher. Strategists 
concluded the inflation rate will likely be even worse than previously thought 
when the effect of the oil price jump is calculated for August and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're looking at here are straight worries about inflation," said 
Lincoln Anderson, an economist for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. "The CPI report was 
not a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders sell on bad inflation news, which erodes the value of fixed-income 
investments and lessens the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will ease 
interest rates to stimulate economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.375% late Wednesday.

Dollar Continues Downward Tumble 
</P>
<P>
The dollar tumbled to an all-time low against the German mark during domestic 
trading as heightened Persian Gulf tensions and further signs of U.S. economic 
weakness spurred a wave of selling. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 1.5525 marks in late New York trading, down from 1.566 
marks late Wednesday and from 1.5645 marks Tuesday, the previous low in the 
modern mark's 42-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was sharply lower against the Swiss franc and British pound. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the U.S. is involved in this crisis I think we're going to find 
that the dollar is not the safe haven it once was during international crises," 
said Scott Horwitz, a vice president for foreign exchange trading with Bank of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar fell to 147.25 Japanese yen from 147.65 yen late 
Wednesday. Earlier in Tokyo, it rose to 147.90 Japanese yen from 147.15 yen at 
Wednesday's close. In London, the dollar was quoted at 147.62 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell worldwide against the British pound. The pound rose to 
$1.9095 in New York from $1.9090 late Wednesday. In London, sterling fell to 
$1.8985 from $1.9045 late Wednesday.

COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold Rises; Other Markets End Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices surged Thursday on New York's Commodity Exchange as a 
flurry of developments in the Persian Gulf triggered a rally in crude oil 
prices, a dive in the stock market and a renewal of inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed, and grains 
and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $6.20 to $6.90 higher, with the contract for spot delivery 
up $6.60 at $409.20 an ounce; silver was 9.9 to 10 cents higher, with the spot 
August contract at $5.168 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
The heightened tensions in the Mideast contributed to a 66-point drop in the 
Dow Jones industrial index and a sharp rise in oil prices on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting dimming prospects for a resumption of Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti oil exports any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 to 92 cents higher, with September 
at $27.36 a barrel. Heating oil was 2 to 2.62 cents higher, with September at 
75.47 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline was 1.8 to 3.41 cents higher, with 
September at 87.46 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as 
cattle traders evened up their positions ahead of today's monthly 
cattle-on-feed report from the Agriculture Department.

TRUMP MAY MISS PAYMENT ON BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid signs that Donald J. Trump's financial problems are worsening, a report 
released Thursday shows that the deal maker is in danger of missing a 
$47-million junk-bond payment due Nov. 15 on the Taj Mahal casino hotel in 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, is a 
scathing assessment of the finances of Trump's most costly and lavish 
investment, the opulent $1-billion gaming palace that opened in April. It also 
says the Trump Shuttle is dangerously low on cash and the Trump Castle casino 
hotel, which got an 11th-hour rescue in June, may face a repeat crisis next 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, asked at the New Jersey Casino Control Commission hearings about a 
possible default on the Taj Mahal bond payment, responded with a terse, "No 
comment."

<P>
A federal grand jury indicted a Carlsbad motel operator, five Los Angeles men 
and a Mexican national on charges of running an alien-smuggling ring that 
whisked about 600 people per month to Santa Ana and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Travel Inn Motel, Bharat Thakkar, 28, of Carlsbad was 
charged with conspiring to smuggle aliens and two counts of harboring aliens, 
federal prosecutors said. The six others, all of whom are in custody, were 
indicted on charges that ranged from conspiracy to transporting aliens, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. George C. Aguilar said. The immigrants were charged $250 
to $300 to go to drop houses in Santa Ana and Los Angeles, he said.

Oil platform workers rescued four people from the Pacific after their 
single-engine plane crash-landed nine miles off the coast of Santa Barbara, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The only injury was a slight cut over an eye suffered by the pilot, Jack Loomis 
of Goleta, said Will Bailey, foreman on a Texaco drilling platform. A worker on 
the platform spotted the plane's tail in the water, and a rescue boat was sent, 
Bailey said. "They were cold and disoriented," he said. "We let them shower, 
fed them and a helicopter flew them to a hospital in Goleta for observation." 
The plane had left Santa Barbara for a sightseeing tour over the Channel 
Islands.

VELODROME CAN HIDE, BUT IT CAN'T RUN WITHOUT SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balboa Park's Morley Field is not all lush landscaping and well-manicured ball 
yards. There is one part of this recreational area that remains dusty and 
seemingly neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Well behind the tennis courts and swimming pool, on the other side of the 
Eucalyptus trees, tucked below a ridge above which the baseball diamonds lay 
and at the edge of Florida Canyon sits the San Diego Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
It is an almost perfect setting for a sport which, relatively speaking, remains 
out of view in this country. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's is one of only 18 velodromes in the country and many park goers 
still don't know the structure exists. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there's good reason for that. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being off in its own little corner, there are no paved parking lots 
nearby, just a long, bumpy dirt road leading from Pershing Drive that actually 
remains unseen from that busy roadway. 
</P>
<P>
To find the velodrome, one either must be armed with good directions or stumble 
upon it. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Rowe, 9, found it earlier this week. He didn't have directions, in fact 
he wasn't even looking for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was here the other day playing baseball with my Dad," Rowe said. "I was just 
looking around." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe not only happened upon the velodrome, but he found Martin Graf, who is on 
the coaching staff of the San Diego Velodrome Assn., which operates the 
facility on lease from the city. Graf was giving lessons to other youths at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him how much it cost to sign up," Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
The answer explains how desperate the sport is for participants -- lessons are 
free to kids through the age of 17. As it turned out, Rowe signed up for a 
four-week class. His first lesson was a one-on-one session with a former 
world-record holder in the 4,000-meter pursuit: Graf. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Switzerland, Graf qualified for the 1980 Swiss Olympic team with a 
world record time of 4:40.01 in the pursuit. The next day he broke his wrist, 
keeping him out of the Moscow Games. 
</P>
<P>
He now spends his afternoons giving free lessons to kids at the velodrome. It 
isn't that he works for free, but because the program is funded by the Amateur 
Athletics Foundation of Los Angeles through profits from the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to develop future Olympians. And both Graf and Doreen Smith, who 
heads the velodrome association, maintain that just might be happening. 
</P>
<P>
"The program has only been here for three years," Graf said, "and already it 
has been very successful." 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Cycling Federation Junior Nationals, which were held here last 
week, two San Diego youngsters who started out in the AAF program took home 
gold medals. Crystal Waters won the four-event omnion for girls 13-14 and Zac 
Copeland won the 200-meter match sprint for boys 17-18. There were other local 
children -- Dirk Copeland (not related to Zac), Denise Mueller and Vincent Ones 
-- who also got their start through the AAF program and who also won medals 
during the championships. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' story is the most striking. Her family moved here from Oregon a couple 
years ago with the intention of finding good training for Crystal's brother, 
Rocky, but when they learned there was no cost involved, Crystal also began 
cycling. Waters' mother, Ginny, credits the AAF with her daughters' progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," Ginny said. "I was never in a situation where I could plunk 
down $60 for a 12-year-old to start cycling." 
</P>
<P>
Waters is now considered one of the best young cyclists in the country, but 
most of the youngsters who take lessons or ride at the velodrome simply do so 
for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone could just acknowledge and understand the types of things we've 
accomplished here," Smith said. "We're talking about underprivileged kids and 
we're providing them with an opportunity to enjoy a new sport. I think the city 
needs more programs of this type." 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just children who are getting started at the velodrome, and 
neither are its activities limited to cycling. 
</P>
<P>
Adults can sign up for beginners' lessons, which go twice a week for four weeks 
at a cost of $70. 
</P>
<P>
While most adults who take the classes do so for fun or cardiovascular fitness, 
several have taken the sport rather seriously and have begun racing on the 
masters circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I started in March," said Greg Laney, who as a member of Cyclo-Vets uses the 
velodrome every Wednesday night. "I wanted to improve my bike-handling skills 
and everybody recommends that you go ride on a track to do that. I found out 
that the San Diego Velodrome Assn. has a developmental program that acquaints 
you with the sport and teaches you about the various races. I got involved in 
that so I could ride in masters." 
</P>
<P>
Laney competed in the Masters National championships, held here last month. 
Though he finished eighth out of eight racers in the 3,000-meter pursuit for 
50-54 year-olds, he nevertheless dropped his personal best by seven seconds to 
4:32. 
</P>
<P>
But one need not take formal lessons or be a member of a cycling club to use 
the velodrome. It is open to the public when classes and races are not being 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Many users don't even own a track bike, which is quite different than a road 
bike. Track bikes have no breaks and only one large gear to which the pedals 
are directly connected. Once it is going at a good clip, the bike won't stop 
pedaling. 
</P>
<P>
Besides cyclists with road bikes, mountain bikers, skateboarders and 
rollerbladers have all found the structure, with its banks and turns, a more 
than suitable alternative to roads and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
And this is an easy velodrome to use. At 28 degrees, it has the shallowest 
banking of any in the country. Some velodromes are so steep that cyclists fall 
down if they are not going 20 m.p.h. At this one, users can come to a complete 
stop and maintain balance. 
</P>
<P>
Although signs say "bicycles only," the velodrome association doesn't really 
mind alternative uses, as long as those people don't interfere with cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't tolerate anyone else on the track when we're having races or 
classes," Graf said. "But we're pretty tolerant of any other sports. The basic 
idea is to promote sport and get people involved in a healthy lifestyle no 
matter what sport they choose." 
</P>
<P>
But alternative sports may some day become the mainstays at the velodrome. The 
AAF grant runs out in another year and Smith has so far been unsuccessful in 
securing a corporate sponsor to keep the association intact. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, everybody wants to turn on the TV and watch the gold medals flow," 
Smith said, "but no one wants to do what it takes to develop the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Without the AAF, which puts in $40,000 per year to keep the association, track, 
bikes and equipment operational, Smith estimates she would have to charge $50 
per youngster just to break even and keep everything running.

REGULATORS VETO FARWEST PLAN TO RAISE CAPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE REJECTION, PLUS NEW CURBS ON THE S&amp;L'S ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS, 
RAISE QUESTIONS ON WHETHER IT CAN SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a stunning blow to FarWest Savings &amp; Loan, federal regulators have 
rejected the thrift's plan to raise new capital and have imposed harsh new 
restrictions on its ability to do business, the ailing firm said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, FarWest will not be able to make new loans without 
regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
The action raises new questions about whether FarWest, owned by the billionaire 
Belzberg brothers of Canada, can survive. Newport Beach-based FarWest is among 
the few thrifts that invested heavily in risky junk bonds to so far avoid 
government seizure. 
</P>
<P>
The action also appears to bring added pressure upon the Belzbergs to shore up 
the firm's capital base -- or possibly risk losing their investment. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-branch FarWest, principal subsidiary of Los Angeles-based FarWest 
Financial Corp., said it was appealing to Washington officials the rejection of 
its capital plan by the Office of Thrift Supervision in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L also reported new losses Thursday, apparently caused by growing 
problems in its portfolio of real estate loans. FarWest said it lost $3.7 
million in the second quarter after setting aside new reserves of $16.9 million 
-- almost three times its first-quarter reserve -- to cover potential loan and 
investment losses. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest's losses for the first half of the year now total $29.9 million. The 
S&amp;L lost $46.1 million last year, all in the final six months. Much of the 
red ink has been attributed to the government-mandated writedown of its junk 
bond portfolio, which was valued at $412 million as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
While the appeal of its capital plan rejection is pending in Washington, the 
thrift has been barred from selling or purchasing assets or making new loans 
without prior approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision's San Francisco 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift will continue to service already issued loans and maintain other 
operations as normal. Deposits will continue to be insured up to $100,000 per 
account category. 
</P>
<P>
Selling a large chunk of its assets to raise cash was a key ingredient of 
FarWest's capital improvement plan. FarWest officials have said they intended 
to shrink the S&amp;L's asset base to $2.7 billion from $3.7 billion now. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest Financial said the capital plan "depended in part on the liquidation of 
a wholly owned subsidiary into FarWest Savings," but federal regulators in San 
Francisco opposed the sale. FarWest would not identify the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Rejection of the plan by the regional OTS office "is a fairly significant 
action," said thrift analyst Ken Thomas, president of KH Thomas Associates in 
Miami. "There are many steps along the way that we look at for signs of when 
the government will get into the situation, and this is always considered a 
very big step. The rejection of a capital plan is not to be taken lightly." 
</P>
<P>
If the thrift's capital improvement plan is not reinstated by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., which oversees thrift regulation, FarWest S&amp;L said 
its net worth would plunge to somewhere between negative $23.6 million and 
negative $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company currently has a net worth of $37.7 million, which means the thrift 
is still solvent, but it is still below capital standards mandated by the 
federal thrift law. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest officials emphasized the thrift continues to be profitable on an 
operating basis. 
</P>
<P>
The unanswered question in FarWest S&amp;L's case is whether the Belzbergs are 
now willing to pump more of their own money into the thrift to keep it alive. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Green, FarWest S&amp;L's president and chief executive, said Thursday 
that he has not been informed of any investment decision by the Belzbergs. 
</P>
<P>
Green declined to characterize the impact of the OTS decision on FarWest, but 
said the restrictions on loans and disposition of assets shouldn't impose a 
hardship. "I believe we will be able to get approved what we want approved," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Green also said regulators have not set a time limit on the thrift's efforts to 
raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
A cash injection from the three Belzberg brothers, whose wealth stems from a 
diversified real estate, energy and financial services empire and from success 
in corporate raids, was not part of the capital improvement plan rejected by 
the OTS. 
</P>
<P>
"The capital plan clearly didn't contemplate money from the brothers," analyst 
Thomas said. "Just because they've got deep pockets doesn't mean they are going 
to dig into them." 
</P>
<P>
FarWest is among a handful of thrifts that invested heavily in junk bonds, the 
high-risk, high-yield debt securities that helped pay for many corporate 
mergers in the 1980s. But Congress last year passed legislation requiring 
thrifts to dispose of those portfolios by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the junk bond market has suffered and many thrifts with large 
holdings have been hurt, including Columbia Savings in Beverly Hills, Lincoln 
Savings in Irvine, Imperial Savings in San Diego, Gibraltar Savings in Beverly 
Hills, CenTrust Bank in Miami and Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest Financial said Thursday that the federally mandated capital improvement 
plan for the S&amp;L, which was filed with regulators Dec. 26, was rejected 
when thrift regulators in San Francisco determined that the proposed 
liquidation of a major subsidiary was not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Finley, a Brea-based thrift analyst, said the liquidation plan appears to 
have been an attempt by FarWest to claim the net worth of the subsidiary unit 
as its own. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest did not identify the subsidiary, but some analysts believe it is the 
thrift's stock and direct real estate investment unit, which had a $463-million 
portfolio as of April 12. New investments by thrifts in those areas now are 
barred by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest also said it is currently undergoing its regular annual audit by state 
and federal regulators. The examination could result in the thrift being forced 
to establish higher reserves for loans.

Dreyer's Hires New Ad Agency: San Francisco agency Goldberg Moser O'Neil 
Advertising, formed by former executives of Chiat/Day/Mojo, has won the account 
for Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. The account has estimated annual billings of 
$8 million to $10 million. For the past year, Oakland-based Dreyer's has used 
independent free-lancers for the business. Prior to that, the Dreyer's account 
was with Hal Riney Partners, which developed the "unbelievable spokesman for an 
unbelievable product" campaign that featured such offbeat celebrities as G. 
Gordon Liddy and Zsa Zsa Gabor.

A chemical spill forced officials to close three lanes of the northbound Golden 
State Freeway near Gorman for more than four hours early this morning, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a truck rear-ended another truck carrying a shipment of 
antifreeze and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The 3 a.m. accident occurred half a mile south of California 138. Antifreeze 
spilled onto the roadway, but there were no injuries and only minor truck 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County firefighters called for a hazardous materials unit after 
learning that the truck carried a variety of chemicals that could be dangerous. 
After firefighters determined that only antifreeze leaked, the emergency was 
downgraded and sand was used to soak up the liquid. All freeway lanes were 
reopened by 7:42 a.m., the CHP said.

<P>
The stabbing death of a Northridge writer is under investigation after a 
neighbor became suspicious when a back yard sprinkler was left running for two 
days and called police. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Douglas Scott Rogo, 40, was found at 1 p.m. Thursday on the floor 
of his home in the 18100 block of Schoenborn Street. 
</P>
<P>
Officers responding to the unidentified neighbor's call, turned off the 
sprinkler and found a side door partially open, Los Angeles Police Lt. L. A. 
Durrer said. There were no signs of struggle and the home where Rogo lived 
alone was not ransacked, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Durrer added there are no suspects nor a known motive. 
</P>
<P>
Rogo was author of about 30 books on parapsychology, the investigation of 
psychic phenomena, police said. He worked at home in an office with shelves 
containing several books on telepathy, clairvoyance and other areas of 
extrasensory perception.

NASA: THE LONG SILENCE FROM THE SPACECRAFT SENT TO MAP VENUS HAD SCIENTISTS 
HOLDING THEIR BREATH.

Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lost contact with Magellan, the 
sophisticated radar-mapping spacecraft that entered orbit around Venus just 
last Friday, for 14 hours before communications were regained today. 
</P>
<P>
During a routine orientation test Thursday night, the spacecraft turned its 
antennas from Earth and pointed a small on-board telescope at two bright stars 
whose positions provide reference marks for the spacecraft's internal 
gyroscopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get a signal back," JPL spokesman Allen Wood said today. 
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the spacecraft may have inadvertently locked on to a 
different, third star, disorienting its internal reference system so that it 
could no longer point its antenna toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the spacecraft is in no immediate danger. "We're pretty 
certain it is not tumbling," Wood said, because Earth-based receivers would 
pick up intermittent radio signals if it were. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of Magellan would have been a shattering blow to NASA, which has already 
been rocked this summer by the grounding of its shuttle fleet because of 
hydrogen leaks and defects in its highly touted Hubble Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Tony Spear was in the midst of a news conference today to 
outline the loss of contact when excited engineers ran in to announce a signal 
had been received from Magellan, the centerpiece of a $551-million mission to 
map the hidden surface of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
"It is Magellan's signal," project engineer Steve Wall said. "It is in lock. It 
has been verified to be Magellan's signal. This is slow telemetry (but) the 
spacecraft looks healthy." 
</P>
<P>
However, both of Magellan's high-data-rate radio transmitters were off, 
indicating that the spacecraft was or had been operating in a computer-induced 
state of hibernation called a "safe mode."

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HITS 7-YEAR LOW; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: TREND HAILED BUT ANALYSTS WARN THAT OIL IMPORTS COULD BECOME A GROWING 
FUTURE PROBLEM.

Record exports and shrinking oil imports helped push the nation's merchandise 
trade deficit to a seven-year low in June, the government reported today. But 
analysts saw oil as a problem in coming months because of the Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the deficit dropped to $5.07 billion -- a 34.7% 
decline from $7.77 billion in May and the lowest since a $3.96-billion 
imbalance was posted in June, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who had joined many analysts earlier in 
predicting the deficit would drop significantly this year, was quick to note 
the record $34.29 billion in exports. 
</P>
<P>
"While the month-to-month figures can be erratic, the strong, positive trend 
indicates increasing U.S. export competitiveness in the world marketplace," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 4.6% increase in exports included not only $500 million in aircraft 
shipments but gains in other business capital equipment as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, called the exports "good 
news" because that sector "was the only part of the economy with any strength" 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Benz, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said the figure 
will boost the second-quarter gross national product, which earlier had been 
estimated to have grown a meager 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one component that might help us skate around a recession in the 
second half of the year," Benz said. 
</P>
<P>
Imports declined 2.9% to $39.37 billion, helped by a $631-million drop in oil 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Oil imports in June fell 14.6% to $3.69 billion. Americans imported 8.40 
million barrels a day, down from 8.95 billion in May. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit is the difference between imports and exports and, for the first 
six months, was running at an annual rate of $91.62 billion. If it ended the 
year at that pace, it would be the first deficit since 1983 under $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were quick, however, to toss in the Middle East caveat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Persian Gulf crisis is already generating oil price increases which likely 
will contribute to a worsening trade deficit in the future," said John Howard, 
international finance director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

PAKISTAN: IJAZ UL-HAQ CALLS FOR NEW INVESTIGATION INTO AIR CRASH TWO YEARS AGO 
THAT ALSO COST U.S. ENVOY HIS LIFE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Zia ul-Haq's oldest son today blamed former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
and her government for his father's death in a mysterious plane crash two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
At a memorial ceremony marking the anniversary, Ijaz ul-Haq called for a new 
investigation into the Aug. 17, 1988, crash that killed Zia, many of Pakistan's 
top military generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel. 
</P>
<P>
An inquiry ruled the crash was sabotage, but a criminal investigation was never 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Ijaz spoke at a news conference as tens of thousands of Pakistanis, reeling 
from 20 turbulent months of democracy, streamed to the grave of the fallen 
dictator to pay tribute. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners traveled by foot, cart and bus to the giant Faisal Mosque to offer 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
"The previous government through criminal negligence covered up any evidence," 
charged Ijaz, who is launching his own political career. "The former prime 
minister and her ministers actually ridiculed the tragedy, provided cover to 
the criminals and shut the door on any investigation." 
</P>
<P>
He said Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party was responsibile for the crash and 
demanded that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, head of the military-backed 
caretaker government that replaced Bhutto on Aug. 6, and the army chief of 
staff open a new investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, who in turn blames Zia for her father's execution in 1979, could not be 
immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's government was dismissed after being accused of corruption, nepotism 
and ineptitude. Bhutto, whose father was overthrown by Zia in 1977, claims a 
similar coup was staged against her but camouflaged by the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 on charges of conspiring to 
murder a political enemy who was never killed. 
</P>
<P>
While in power Bhutto proclaimed her father a martyr for democracy. Ijaz says 
his father was a martyr for Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ijaz vowed to carry on his father's pan-Islamic dream. 
</P>
<P>
"The dream is being fulfilled -- Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey," Ijaz 
told an estimated 100,000 people who crowded onto the sprawling grounds of the 
Faisal Mosque and climbed its sloping roof and towering spires for the brief, 
low-key ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"A new movement, a new unity will start from here," he said. "I swear by the 
grave of Zia ul-Haq. I will be the first to sacrifice my life." 
</P>
<P>
Ijaz led a huge procession to the mosque from the neighboring city of 
Rawalpindi, the headquarters of the army that has ruled Pakistan for more than 
half of its 43-year history.

RAPE CHARGE HINGES ON SPLIT PERSONALITIES;

COURT: THE VICTIM DISPLAYS THREE DIFFERENT IDENTITIES DURING TESTIMONY.

A woman who says she has 21 personalities displayed three of them -- herself 
and characters named Franny and Jennifer -- in testifying that she was raped by 
a man who took her out for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The judge required her to take an oath each time she changed identities during 
the hearing Thursday. Lawyers introduced themselves to the different 
personalities. Each time, she behaved as if the testimony was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the testimony, Judge Robert Hawley ordered Mark A. Peterson, 29, 
to stand trial for sexual assault. No trial date was set. 
</P>
<P>
To convict Peterson, Dist. Atty. Joseph Paulus said he must prove three things 
-- that the victim had a mental illness, that she was incapable of appraising 
her own conduct and that Peterson knew about the illness. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson claims the woman consented to sex and that he did not know she had 
multiple personalties. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman said she told Peterson that she had multiple personalities and 
introduced him to some of them, and that he took advantage of one of them -- 
Jennifer, a fun-loving 20-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
That personality was dominant when Peterson forced her to have sex in the front 
seat of a car after they went out for coffee, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, she also testified as herself, a 26-year-old single Oshkosh woman 
who is in therapy for multiple personality disorder and cannot remember the 
incident, and as Franny, a 32-year-old motherly type who reported the alleged 
attack to friends. 
</P>
<P>
According to Leonard Kaplan, a University of Wisconsin Law School professor, 
state law clearly says that someone deemed mentally ill cannot consent to sex. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Edward Salzsieder said the key issue is whether the woman is 
mentally ill or just a "big show." 
</P>
<P>
During about 90 minutes of testimony, the woman paused only briefly during 
personality switches requested by Paulus. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I have Jennifer, the one who likes to have fun?" Paulus asked after 
talking with Franny. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," the woman replied, smiling and closing her eyes. Seconds later, 
she opened her eyes and blurted, "Hi, Mr. Paulus" in a slightly higher voice. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, with her therapist seated nearby, testified that Peterson, a man she 
met two days earlier while fishing, raped her June 11. She testified Peterson 
wanted Jennifer to appear. She said he asked: "'Can I love you?' I said, 'OK.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer did not know what sex was but agreed because "he just told me to," the 
woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Peterson noted that during sex, the woman's 6-year-old personality, 
Emily, appeared before she eventually became Franny again.

Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) angrily stormed out of a meeting with labor leaders

"I'm not going to take these threats," Packwood said Thursday.

Officials of the Oregon State District Council of Carpenters met Packwood on 
the steps of the Embarcadero Resort Hotel, saying the group should not be held

But Packwood said the group's conduct had been "ungentlemanly" and added before 
leaving, "Don't count on me any more, fellas."

Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos told educators from this Texas-Mexico 
border area today that students who do not speak English are not ready to 
learn, and drew swift criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, speaking to about 1,500 Laredo principals and teachers, urged them to 
get parents more involved in education and to make sure students have a command 
of English. 
</P>
<P>
"Parental involvement and language competency are basic," Cavazos said. "If 
that child cannot speak English the first day of school, that child is not 
ready to learn." 
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion afterward, South Texas superintendents took issue with 
Cavazos. 
</P>
<P>
To rousing applause, La Joya Supt. Robert Zamora called the secretary's remarks 
"disabling." Zamora said students are capable of learning in other languages.

MUSCOVITES RUN INTO TRULY SPINE-CHILLING SHORTAGE: ICE CREAM

<P>
The Soviet capital, which often boasts of having the world's best ice cream, 
has a shortage in these waning days of summer, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream kiosks on street corners and city parks have been displaying "No Ice 
Cream" signs, although they continue to sell souvenirs, marshmallows, 
chocolates and other candies, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream is still available at foreign outlets, such as the Baskin-Robbins 
stores in the Rossia Hotel and on the Arbat pedestrian mall, or the 
Soviet-Swiss joint venture Pinguin. 
</P>
<P>
But lines are long and prices are high for Muscovites who have always taken 
pride in their own ice cream, which they buy in paper-wrapped slabs or on 
sticks, rather than in cones. 
</P>
<P>
Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Mosgortorg, the Directorate for State-Run Trade in 
Moscow, as saying two of the three ice cream-making factories in Moscow are 
closed for repairs this summer. One might reopen early next month, it said.

The plant, which employs 2,100 hourly workers who build about 3,700 Mustangs a

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter called today for countries to 
push for farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round of multinational trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce, Yeutter said one of 
his principle objectives in the Uruguay Round, which ends in December, is the 
elimination of subsidies that distort global trade in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said talks have stalled in past years because the agricultural sector 
of most nations is a strong political force, making reform difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is a tough issue. We have been trying to negotiate better GATT 
rules on agriculture for 40 years without success," he said, referring to the 
Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "Hopefully, we will have 
some success this time for the first time ever."

State and local law officers enlisted the aid of truck drivers to keep a swarm 
of motoring fans away from buses carrying the popular rock group New Kids on 
the Block. 
</P>
<P>
The truckers, called in on their citizens' band radios, formed a slow moving 
blockade on I-40 behind buses carrying the singers from a Thursday-night 
concert in Nashville to an appearance tonight in Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that as many as 85 cars carrying fans had begun following the 
buses, often pulling their vehicles perilously close. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus drivers were having a little trouble with fans darting in and out in 
front of them trying to get a look inside the buses," said Roane County 
Sheriff's Deputy Dowell Isham. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't trying to wreck the buses or anything. They were just trying to 
get a glimpse inside."

Comedian Francesca Hilton, daughter of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and Zsa Zsa

<P>
"Every time I need material I ask my mother to go out there and do something," 
Hilton said Thursday. 
</P>

She begins a two-week Vegas World casino stand on Sept. 12, opening for Tony 
Martin in what she calls "the biggest break of my career." She has been playing 
the comedy club circuit for years.

<P>
"Comedy is OK," Hilton said. "I felt it was cheaper than shock treatment. If I 
survived the Gabors all these years, I figure comedy should be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Hilton opens her routine by getting family matters out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them who I am right away. I say my mother is the queen of outer space," 
said Hilton, referring to one of Gabor's campy movies, "Queen of Outer Space."

ROONEY JR. LOOKING FOR A BREAK

Mickey Rooney Jr. has endured a series of false career starts, but his 
autobiography -- "Which One's Your Mother?" -- and a couple of new country 
songs might signal the break he has been looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is still cautious even though his country songs "It Takes a Good Girl to 
Get Me" and "There's No Easy Way Out of This Love" have been greeted 
enthusiastically by record companies in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"The people there are very interested," he said Thursday, adding that he 
expected to sign a recording deal soon. But he is quick to temper his optimism, 
citing past experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had eight record deals since I was a kid and it never went anywhere," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is the first of the actor's 10 children. His mother is Betty Jane Baker.

Stone collapsed in his corner seconds after scoring a unanimous decision over 
fellow Australian Garry Wills to win the vacant Queensland state title.

Official ring physician Jim Yates treated Stone in the ring for apparent heat 
exhaustion. Ten minutes later, his head rolling from side to side and blood 
dripping from his mouth, the boxer was carried into the dressing room and later 
taken by ambulance to the nearby Princess Alexandra Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Stone has a blood clot on the right side of his brain and is paralyzed down 
his left side," Yates said. "He is responding to some commands, but is not

Former Vanderbilt football player Brad Gaines says he's ready to challenge the 
NCAA in court. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines, who made himself available for this spring's National Football League 
draft but was not selected, contends that he should not lose his final year of 
eligibility with the Commodores. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines and his attorney, former Vanderbilt quarterback Roger May, contend that 
Gaines should not be considered a professional since he was not drafted and he 
never contacted an agent. 
</P>
<P>
May said Vanderbilt would be named in the suit as a "nominal party" but the 
suit is actually against the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to play football," Gaines said Thursday night before referring all 
other questions to May. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt football Coach Watson Brown said the case is strictly a legal 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court rules Brad can play, we'll welcome him back. But we're not going 
to break any NCAA rules," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
May said Gaines' case parallels that of former Notre Dame player Braxton Banks, 
whose request to return to college football was denied today by a federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Banks decision, Gaines said he may pursue his case even if the 
Indiana court rules against Banks, May said. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, we will sit down and think about it. I feel the suit has 
merit, and Brad's case is even more compelling than Banks'. Banks contacted an 
agent, which is against NCAA rules, while Brad did not," May said.

BREAKING BRONCOS OR COACHING THEM, IT'S HIGH-STRESS PURSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HAMELIN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are even more stressful ways of making a dollar than coaching a 
professional football team. 
</P>
<P>
You can walk a high wire for the circus, be an air traffic controller, hunt 
great whites in scuba gear, hear confessions or go undercover busting Bolivian 
drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
You can umpire Little League baseball games, cat-burgle the Empire State 
Building, command the Red October, staff the complaint window at K mart or work 
a paper route across the South Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
You can do exorcisms, bounce drunks at a biker bar, handle public relations for 
Zsa Zsa Gabor, search for the Maltese Falcon or cover the Sacramento Kings for 
a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
I have probably left out a few. 
</P>
<P>
Still, beyond question, coaching professional football is a high-stress 
pursuit. Witness Denver's Dan Reeves, a driven and excitable man, who was 
carried off a practice field nine days ago complaining of chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
He checked into a hospital, had his engine bored out with a high-tech scraping 
process called an atherectomy, and Tuesday -- six days later -- was back 
coaching the Broncos, saying how everything will be fine from now on as long as 
he avoids that old devil cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The risks must be worth it to Reeves, who can't need the dough and doesn't seem 
insecure about who he is. Yet his very reason for being seems to be the pursuit 
of a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I'm dumb. 
</P>
<P>
I don't get it. Larry King had a heart attack. That's another one: Do a TV show 
in the evening, and a radio show almost till dawn, and in between write a 
newspaper column. King says he had a cigarette on the way to the hospital, 
refusing to give up the things he liked doing until the doctors got his 
attention by implanting five arterial bypasses. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he runs and eats lots of granola and avoids filet mignon as if it were 
poison. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, poor diets cause heart attacks. It isn't just stress. But beyond any 
question, your ticker's biggest enemy isn't food, it's too much adrenaline -- 
which happens to be the life's blood of football. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Brown, the coach who redefined the game in the 1950s, knew what it took to 
win football games: "I doubt if any football team can succeed," he said, 
"unless the coach has the final word on everything from the draft and trades to 
all the responsibilities of a general manager." The burdens implied here are 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
In Don Coryell's first game as coach of the Chargers, the San Diego crowd gave 
him a standing ovation that lasted for minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He had coached the college team there and was an immensely popular choice. 
Later, he was asked if it moved him -- and he astonished the writers by seeming 
astonished. Coryell HADN'T NOTICED! 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about the game," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
The late Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy perhaps best defined the qualities needed for 
coaching: "You have to be smart enough to understand football," he said, "and 
dumb enough to think it's important." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Reeves is well-qualified. Football is a game, supposedly. It has 
little impact on the overall human condition. 
</P>
<P>
When, 300 years from now, some historian's textbook on American history gives 
the 20th Century its nine or 10 paragraphs, my guess is you'll find no mention 
of football at all. 
</P>
<P>
John Madden, I think, understood that. When he had done all there was for the 
doing as the coach of the Raiders, John walked away, saying: "I gave it 
everything I have, and I don't have anything left. . . . I'm retiring from 
football and coaching, and I'm never going to coach again in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has done beer commercials and TV analysis and seems more, rather 
than less, of a person. 
</P>
<P>
If I go down with chest pains tomorrow, and doctors have to go in and scrape 
the plaque from my arteries, try to guess how long it will be before I write 
the next column in hot pursuit of my Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a hint: It will be more than six days. 
</P>
<P>
My old man was a businessman. He smoked black cigars, drank Scotch in 
occasional volume, loved a good steak, and the only time I remember him 
breaking into a run is the one time he chased me out of the kitchen and down 
the block, pausing to break a whippy limb off a lilac tree. I never saw him 
perspire. Not once. He lived to be 95, and it was cancer that got him, not 
stress. A week before he died he was out raking leaves. 
</P>
<P>
His trick was never forgetting that building race tracks and shopping centers 
was what he did, and not what he was. 
</P>
<P>
I wish Reeves well. I hope he earns his Super Bowl and lives to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not, I wouldn't want to be the boss of the Broncos, having to 
explain to Reeves' family why I didn't insist that he take some time off.

BO'S SUCCESSOR HOPES TO HAVE A BALL; 
</P>
<P>
WOLVERINES: WITH SCHEMBECHLER GONE, MOELLER SEES AN OPEN, LONG-BALL GAME.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Michigan Wolverines will still wear black shoes and their old-fashioned 
winged helmets. And the Michigan band will still play "The Victors" after every 
Wolverine touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But in many ways, Michigan football will have a new look this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gone after 21 seasons is Bo Schembechler, the tough and temperamental coach who 
guided the Wolverines to 13 Big Ten championships with a conservative 
philosophy that stressed ball-control offense and dominating defense. 
</P>
<P>
Taking his place is longtime assistant Gary Moeller, a low-key leader who is 
planning to open up the offense with a deep passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had the long-ball threat and now we're going to take it a step 
farther," Moeller said. "We've got to do some things we haven't done before." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Moeller has no desire to change is Michigan's winning ways. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines went 194-48-5 under Schembechler and finished in the Top 20 in 
19 of his 21 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"What's tough is knowing what you've got to live up to," Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller knows Bo as well as anyone. After all, he started his college coaching 
career as a Schembechler assistant at Miami of Ohio in 1967 and followed Bo to 
Michigan in 1969. Except for a two-year stint at Illinois in the late 1970s, 
Moeller has been at Michigan ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between me and somebody else taking over this program is that I 
belong here," said Moeller, whose son Andy played linebacker for the 
Wolverines. "A lot of the things we do here might be things I had a hand in 
putting in." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's never easy to replace a legend. Just ask Earle Bruce, who was 
forced to leave Ohio State despite a .755 winning percentage. His record was 
good, but not good enough to satisfy Buckeye fans who kept comparing him to the 
man he replaced, Woody Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Is Moeller worried that he'll face a similar fate at Michigan? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm nervous. But nervousness can be a positive emotion," Moeller said. 
"I'm looking forward to the challenge. I'm as anxious as anybody else to see 
what this team is going to be like." 
</P>
<P>
When Moeller looks, he is bound to like what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, who are trying to become the first team to win three straight 
outright Big Ten titles, have 17 starters back from a team that went 10-2 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Even Elvis is back. 
</P>
<P>
That's Elvis Grbac, a 6-foot-5 sophomore quarterback who led the Wolverines to 
four victories last season while filling in for injured starter Michael Taylor. 
Grbac has a strong arm, and Moeller intends to use it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to fit our style to our personnel," Moeller said. "No 
matter who the new coach was, he was going to have to change a little bit. 
Elvis Grbac obviously is not going to run the same type of offense that Michael 
Taylor did." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines will also have a new look at running back, where they must 
replace last year's leading rusher, Tony Boles, and fullback Leroy Hoard. 
Senior Jarrod Bunch will take over at fullback, while senior Allen Jefferson 
and sophomore Jon Vaughn will probably share time at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever carries the ball will have the luxury of running behind a huge, 
experienced line that includes all-Big Ten guard Dean Dingman. 
</P>
<P>
Experience also will be a plus on defense, where All-American safety Tripp 
Welborne is one of nine returning starters. Welborne leads a strong secondary 
that includes cornerback David Key and safety Vada Murray. 
</P>
<P>
The Moeller era officially opens Sept. 15 at Notre Dame. But he knows that 
Schembechler's shadow will linger at Michigan for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
There are several photographs of Schembechler in Moeller's office, and the 
team's media guide includes a farewell tribute to Bo. 
</P>
<P>
"I know why everybody's asking these questions about Bo," Moeller said. "I 
imagine it'll be like this for two or three years. But it's always going to pop 
up. . . . They're still talking about Woody Hayes in Columbus."

CAN LE PRINCE REIGN AT A LONGER DISTANCE?

<P>
In workouts, Le Prince has beaten the best horses in his trainer's barn. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday in the Travers at Saratoga, he will try to beat 13 other 3-year-olds, 
including Go And Go and Thirty Six Red, who ran 1-2 in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the best horse on the grounds," trainer Dominick Imperio said. 
"He does everything perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Well, his record is perfect, but he's only raced once in his life -- winning a 
maiden race July 29 at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
That race was at seven furlongs. The Travers is a testing 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Le Prince, who was hampered by bucked shins as a 2-year-old and also this year, 
was supposed to start in the 1 1/8-mile Jim Dandy on Aug. 5 at Saratoga, but he 
missed the race because of a rash. 
</P>
<P>
Imperio is confident, however, that the colt can handle the Travers distance in 
stakes-toughened company. 
</P>
<P>
Imperio doesn't think the speedy colt's lack of race experience will hurt him 
in the large field because "if he's going to win the race, he'll go 
wire-to-wire." 
</P>
<P>
"He'll pull the jockey to the lead," added Imperio, who said it takes a 
160-pound exercise rider to hold the colt in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
The jockey Saturday will be Laffit Pincay, who will replace Jose Santos. Santos 
was impressed by Le Prince in his debut, but he is committed in the Travers to 
ride Profit Key, winner of the Peter Pan and Dwyer, both at 1 1/8 miles at 
Belmont Park, for trainer D. Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
The track oddsmaker made Le Prince, who will start from the No. 12 post, 12-1 
in the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
Le Prince will start just inside of Go And Go, who will be ridden by Michael 
Kinane of Ireland. Kinane rode him to victory in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes 
on June 9. That was the last start for the Irish-bred colt, who arrived at 
Saratoga from Ireland early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Go And Go is the 3-1 early favorite. The second choice at 9-2 is the Lukas 
entry of Profit Key and Sir Richard Lewis. Next is Thirty Six Red at 5-1, 
followed by Rhythm and Restless Con, each at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red, who won the Gotham and Wood Memorial before finishing ninth in 
the Kentucky Derby, has raced once since the Belmont, finishing fourth in a 
seven-furlong allowance Aug. 1 at Saratoga. He will be ridden by Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret again will be aboard Rhythm, the 1989 2-year-old champion whose 
only stakes win this year was in the 1 1/8-mile Colin on June 9 at Belmont. In 
his last two starts, he finished second in the Dwyer and third in the 1 
1/8-mile Haskell Handicap on July 28 at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
Restless Con, who will be ridden by Tim Doocy, won the Haskell in his last 
start. 
</P>
<P>
If all 14 3-year-olds go to the post, the 121st Travers will be worth 
$1,186,000, with $711,600 to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
The field in post-position order is Shot Gun Scott, Sir Richard Lewis, Rhythm, 
Restless Con, Thirty Six Red, Profit Key, Baron de Vaux, Rowdy Regal, Secret 
Hello, Solar Splendor, Yonder, Le Prince, Go And Go and Tee's Prospect. 
</P>
<P>
All will carry 126 pounds.

A ROSE OF COUNTRY MUSIC BURSTS INTO BLOOM AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
REBIRTH: A GRANDE DAME OF THE TRADITIONAL COUNTRY SOUND, ROSE MADDOX STAGES 
COMEBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years after suffering a near-fatal heart attack, Rose Maddox, one of the 
grande dames of traditional country music, is cautiously resuming her quest for 
a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seven bypass operations and was unconscious for three months, so I'm 
just now starting to get back into it," said Maddox, who will perform Sunday 
night at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the music business; it's a part of me, and I love it. I've never done 
anything except music, and I can't ever imagine doing without it -- although 
I've had to, for the last couple of years, due to circumstances beyond my 
control." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s and early '60s, Maddox, now 65, scored more than a dozen solo 
hits on the national country charts, including "Gambler's Love," "Kissing My 
Pillow" and "Sing a Little Song of Heartache," which remained in the Top 20 for 
37 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
She also recorded four chart-topping duets with Buck Owens and an album with 
Bill Monroe. In 1963, Maddox was named country music's Top Female Vocalist by 
Cashbox magazine, beating out the legendary Patsy Cline. 
</P>
<P>
Her commercial fortunes, however, soon waned. Maddox's last hit was 1964's 
"Bluebird, Let Me Tag Along," and her last album, recorded in 1986 with John 
Jorgenson of the Desert Rose Band, was never released, due to a lack of record 
company interest. 
</P>
<P>
"They all want this young, new stuff, and I don't know why, I just don't know 
why," Maddox said. "There's a lot of good talent still left in the older ones, 
but they just won't give us the opportunity to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Now that she has returned, Maddox said, things look a lot more promising. She's 
got a new group, the Foggy Notion Band, featuring her 20-year-old grandson, 
Donnie Maddox, on bass. And she's just finished recording an album with Merle 
Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the whole thing completed; it just hasn't been mixed yet because 
Merle's out on the road and we're waiting for him to get back and get it 
mixed," Maddox said. "He says he's sure he can get it on the label he's on, and 
hopefully he can. He's pretty enthused about it." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox was born in Boaz, Ala., to a family of impoverished sharecroppers. In 
the early 1930s, the Maddox clan followed the Dust Bowl migration to 
California, and in 1937, 11-year-old Rose began her musical career. 
</P>
<P>
"We was known as fruit tramps," she recalled. "We had to scrub out a living 
some way or another, so we followed agriculture, pickin' our way through the 
San Joaquin Valley -- until my brother Fred decided he had had enough of 
pickin' cotton. He wanted to be on radio, and he wanted us with him." 
</P>
<P>
Fred soon got his wish. The Maddox Brothers and Rose were hired by Modesto's 
KTRB to play half an hour of "hillbilly music" every weekday morning. Fan mail 
and requests began pouring in, and KTRB added evening and weekend shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We got very popular on radio, and then we started following rodeos up and down 
California on weekends, working for the kitty," said Maddox, who now lives in 
Ashland, Ore. "After we won a hillbilly band contest in Sacramento, we got even 
bigger, and we started spreading out, working dance halls and things. 
</P>
<P>
"But then my brothers got drafted, and that put a halt to our career, it 
certainly did, until the war was over -- and then we started back up." 
</P>
<P>
The Maddox Brothers and Rose not only regained their earlier popularity, they 
exceeded it. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we needed a recording contract, so me and Mama went looking for 
one, down in Hollywood," Maddox recalled. "We only had two days to do it, and 
all the head men of the big companies were out, so we went to this small label 
called Four Star, and they signed us, just like that." 
</P>
<P>
Hyped as "The Most Colorful Hillbilly Band in America," the Maddox Brothers and 
Rose remained with Four Star for six years before signing with Columbia Records 
for another six. 
</P>
<P>
They made several fine records, including a cover of Woody Guthrie's 
"Philadelphia Lawyers" and "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down." They made their 
Grand Ole Opry debut in 1949 and then did a four-year stint on "Louisiana 
Hayride," a Shreveport radio show whose stars used to travel together in weekly 
tour packages between Saturday-night broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We toured with Elvis Presley, Marty Robbins, Jim Reeves, Jimmy Dean and every 
one of the big ones," Maddox said. "We was one of the most popular groups in 
the whole country." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1950s, however, the group was falling part. They weren't getting 
along, Maddox said, and country music was shifting away from bands and toward 
solo artists. 
</P>
<P>
She'd been recording on her own since 1950, but only after the Maddox Brothers 
and Rose broke up in 1957 did she really pursue a solo career. After an 
abortive six-month run as a Grand Ole Opry cast member -- she was kicked off 
for sporting a bare midriff on stage -- she moved out West again and married an 
Oceanside nightclub owner, Jimmy Brogdon, who ran the 101 Club. 
</P>
<P>
For the next six years, Maddox was on top, cranking out hits for Capitol 
Records and touring all over the United States and Europe. Red Smiley, Don Reno 
and Ralph Mooney are among the respected session players who backed her in the 
studio; Albert Lee once backed her on a tour of England. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, however, it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
"The record business wasn't as good as it used to be; it was like it is now, 
everyone looking for new sounds and new faces," Maddox said. "I wasn't the only 
one -- we all sort of lost. It didn't make me feel too good, but I stood up 
under it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Maddox is still standing. Her career got a big boost last year when 
Emmylou Harris invited her out to Nashville to tape a television special. Even 
so, she has yet to graduate from the out-of-the-way honky-tonks and roadhouses 
she's been regularly playing for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the big places; it's much nicer to work in auditoriums, concert halls, 
things like that," Maddox said. "But that's just the way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
"And after what I went through two years ago -- they gave me just a 10% chance 
of living -- I'm happy to be here, period."

Student protesters have widened a campaign to obstruct oil production in the 
Indian state of Assam after New Delhi threatened tough action against them, an 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Assam's Home Minister Bhrigu Kumar Phukan said members of the All Assam 
Students Union had formed a human chain around all six crude-pumping stations 
in the northeastern state, preventing employees from working. 
</P>
<P>
The students want the government to implement a 1985 accord promising 
deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and industrial development of 
resource-rich Assam.

SEABROOK PLANT'S LICENSING PROBED

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating whether its decision to 
grant a full-power license for the Seabrook nuclear power plant was "corruptly 
induced," agency documents say. 
</P>
<P>
An Aug. 7 memo said the NRC inspector general's office was interviewing staff 
members about Nov. 9, 1989, rulings by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. 
The board recommended that the plant in Seabrook, N.H., receive a full-power 
license and it approved evacuation plans. The action came just two days after 
an NRC appeals board said it found four problem areas with the previously 
approved evacuation plans. The NRC licensing board then ruled the four areas 
not to be a problem.
