Cross-Canadian rail traffic was stopped for a second day by two Indian 
blockades in northwestern Ontario. Spokesmen for the Long Lake Ojibwa band and 
the Pic Mobert Ojibwa band said they will not remove their blockades until 
Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon or his deputy minister meet them for 
face-to-face talks. Bernard Abraham of the Long Lake group said the Indians 
want their land expanded, "deplorable" housing conditions improved and services 
upgraded.

Jurors in the Minneapolis trial of three former Northwest pilots charged with 
flying a jetliner while intoxicated asked to review court transcripts and a 
copy of the men's bar tab from a tavern they drank at the night before their 
early morning flight. Attorneys for the pilots maintain crew members proved 
they were not impaired by flying the aircraft "flawlessly" through a freezing 
drizzle and heavy cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants -- captain Norman Prouse, 51, Conyers, Ga.; co-pilot Robert 
Kirchner, 36, Highland Ranch, Colo., and flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, 
Antioch, Tenn. -- guided a Boeing 727 with 91 passengers aboard on a March 8 
flight from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis. In tests, the Northwest Airlines 
pilots had blood-alcohol readings of 0.06%, 0.08% and, for the captain, 0.13%.

Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said he plans to cut $333 million in local aid to help 
balance the state budget, and those reductions will hurt school budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to state Senate committees in Richmond, Va., Wilder detailed his plans 
to deal with a projected $1.4-billion deficit in the state's $26-billion 
1990-92 biennial budget. Wilder's budget director, Karen Washabau, said other 
cuts the governor has proposed in state agency spending could cause 400 to 
1,500 layoffs. But she said those figures were tentative until the governor 
decides on Sept. 14 what specific cuts he will order.

The National Science Foundation chose Florida State University over the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to establish a laboratory for 
high-magnetic field research. 
</P>
<P>
The grant could be worth up to $60 million over five years. "Florida State 
University, while not having on board at present the scientists of the quality 
of those at MIT, was clearly committed to creating a national center of 
excellence," David A. Sanchez, an assistant director of the foundation, said. 
Research related to production and use of magnetic fields can lead to new 
devices for the computer industry, new materials with exceptional strengths and 
major advances in medicine.

SALVAGE TIMBER SUPPLY INCREASED

<P>
Wildfires and drought have more than doubled the amount of salvage timber the 
U.S. Forest Service plans to sell to loggers, officials said. Two-thirds of all 
timber sold on federal lands will be salvage material this year, compared to 
the average 15%, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups filed lawsuits to prevent removal of salvage timber after 
forest fires in 1987 and 1988. Environmentalists argue that fires so damaged 
the land that logging should be permitted only if it is proven that the 
activity will not cause more problems. Timber industry officials say the 
decision to allow greater sales of salvage timber could cut their profits as 
the cheaper wood takes the place of more valuable lumber harvested from living 
trees. "The salvaged trees can't be used to make high-value molding, for 
example, so there's a value loss," said John Hoffmann, director of timber sales 
services for the Timber Assn. of California.

DRUG PANEL'S VIEWS DENIED PUBLICATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has refused to publish the recommendations of a 
state advisory commission which has recommended that California legalize 
marijuana and consider decriminalization of other drugs. The San Francisco 
Examiner disclosed that Van de Kamp's office refused to pay for the printing of 
the Research Advisory Panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, appointed by state agencies and the governor, found that anti-drug 
laws have been "manifestly unsuccessful in that we are now using more and a 
greater variety of drugs, legal and illegal." Created by the Legislature in 
1969 to study drug abuse and possible remedies, the panel recommended that the 
Legislature legalize cultivation of marijuana for personal use, consider 
decriminalizing other drugs on an individual basis and legalize possession of 
hypodermic needles. Assistant Atty. Gen. John Sugiyama accused the panel of 
basing its recommendations on "personal views." Dr. Frederick H. Meyers, the 
panel's vice chairman, said he would use his money to print the banned 
recommendations, and called Van de Kamp's reaction "hysterical." Meyers, a 
professor of pharmacology at UC San Francisco, has served on the panel since 
its inception.

A grocery store has introduced pint-sized shopping carts for children, causing 
a sensation among the toddler-and-older set who tag along while their parents 
shop. Miniature speedways may not be exactly what the owners of the Whole Foods 
Market had in mind when they bought a dozen of the sturdy, 2 1/2-foot-high wire 
replicas of full-sized shopping carts, but so far the carts are drawing in 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can't get her to another store," said Barbara Perkins as her 2-year-old 
daughter, Vanessa, zipped toward the blue-corn tortilla chips. "As long as I 
can steer her away from the ice cream, we'll be fine." The Whole Foods chain 
has had the carts in its Texas stores for two years, and East Coast 
preschoolers have been enjoying life in the fast lane for several years. "They 
were such a hit, we decided to bring them here," said Renee Weller, Whole 
Food's marketing manager. Five-year-old Aaron Zonka sees the produce aisle of 
the local market as his own personal speedway. "It's little, just like me," 
Aaron said of the mini-cart. "Vrrrooooom." A store clerk reported a slightly 
higher rate of breakage where bottles are within reach of groping hands, and 
some parents said they have gotten home with items they don't remember pulling 
from the shelves.

A man who killed a teen-age girl before taking his own life early this month 
may also have attacked four women in the foothills near Stanford University, 
police said. Robert Michel Christy, 28, shot himself to death in his car soon 
after killing 17-year-old Stephanie LeDoux in Rocklin on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford police said he may have been the "foothill rapist," wanted for one 
rape and three rape attempts that appear to have been connected. No motive has 
been established for the killing of LeDoux, who was returning home from a date 
when she apparently got into an altercation with Christy. Stanford police Capt. 
Raoul Niemeyer said Christy was "linked definitely" to one of the attempted 
rapes because he left behind his eyeglasses and a distinctive folding knife.

NAVY: ONE OF FOUR SAILORS WHO WENT PUBLIC WITH ALLEGED SAFETY PROBLEMS ON THE 
NUCLEAR SHIP NIMITZ WAS MET BY HIS FAMILY WHEN THE SHIP DOCKED IN SAN DIEGO.

Rima Puma wept when she saw her son Friday after he debarked from a nuclear 
aircraft carrier in San Diego. Her son was returning not from a war-torn region 
but from a heated battle with the Navy aboard the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
Machinist Mate 2nd Class Steven Puma, one of four sailors disciplined for 
blowing the whistle earlier this month about purported safety problems aboard 
the vessel, said: "These last two weeks have been very stressful." 
</P>
<P>
And that was it. 
</P>
<P>
At the advice of his lawyer, Puma said he could not discuss the controversy 
that has embroiled his life since he and three others told a Seattle television 
station that crew members had flouted safety regulations and the four 
threatened to sabotage the ship's reactors to draw attention to their 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Navy ruled that Puma and the other three sailors would 
no longer be allowed to work aboard a nuclear vessel -- signaling a 
reassignment that will cost each sailor almost $2,000 in annual salary. Puma's 
supervising officers "lost confidence" in him and the others after they spoke 
to the television station about safety problems, rather than take their 
complaints to the Navy through hot lines or other officers, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob 
Pritchard, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Since stepping forward, Puma and the others were threatened, his wife Sara Puma 
said. Both she and her mother-in-law flew to San Diego this week in hopes of 
catching a glimpse of Steven Puma. On Friday, the Navy obliged, and officials 
showed the Pumas aboard the vessel after it docked. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Puma family were given time alone in Capt. Robert C. Williamson's 
quarters, and then all three talked with Williamson about Puma's plight. 
</P>
<P>
The Puma family plans to spend the weekend together in San Diego and on Monday, 
Steven Puma will return to the Nimitz. It could take weeks -- or days -- until 
Puma is reassigned, Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
For Rima Puma, this is the first time she has seen her son in a year. She says 
she is angry at the Navy for making a scapegoat of her son. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a nightmare. It's not an experience I wish for any other parent to 
go through," said Rima Puma. "It just leaves me speechless. They have made it 
appear that my son is unreliable. My son hasn't done anything wrong, and he is 
honest, trustworthy and reliable." 
</P>
<P>
She and her daughter-in-law said they were overjoyed to see Steven but worried 
about the Navy, which has formally closed its investigation into Puma's 
allegations after finding that nine sailors cheated on a safety exam. 
</P>
<P>
"What about all those men on the ship? We still have to push for further 
investigation," Sara Puma said. "I wish I could get them all off the ship, but 
I can't do that. I wish I could. I wish I could make them stay in port and have 
an investigation now."

The origin of the Freeway Tomatoes, recently spotted growing on the Harbor 
Freeway, is still a mystery. But Carol Garnjost of North Hollywood may have 
solved the case of the New Freeway Chickens. 
</P>
<P>
She says that these critters, who roam along the Burbank on-ramp of the 
Hollywood Freeway, aren't related to the Original Freeway Chickens, who resided 
two miles south after surviving the 1969 crash of a poultry truck. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, a neighbor acquired chickens and rabbits," Garnjost writes. 
"He then brought home a pit bull. Needless to say, the chickens and rabbits 
escaped, the chickens to the freeway buffer and the surviving female rabbit 
(who was pregnant) to our yard. 
</P>
<P>
"The chickens have thrived despite predation and their own territorial natures. 
The roosters occasionally fight to the death. We have had opossums take the 
eggs, and local cats and dogs will on occasion obtain a chick dinner (as will) 
a juvenile red-tailed hawk. 
</P>
<P>
"Animal Regulation came by about three years ago after a complaint about the 
noise. I was told the scene was comical -- the roundup netting mostly hens (who 
don't make as much noise). 
</P>

"The noise? We don't mind it. In fact, they serve as remarkable burglar 
alarms."

SAN DIEGO-BASED SHIP TO SAIL FOR MIDEAST

The San Diego-based destroyer tender Acadia will depart within weeks for the 
Persian Gulf, making it the first San Diego-based Navy vessel to sail from the 
West Coast to join the escalating crisis in the Middle East, Navy officials in 
Washington said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sending the Acadia, which could take almost a month to arrive, is a signal that 
Navy officials are gearing up for a long-lasting stint at sea, some say. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly means we are in for the long haul if necessary, but remember a 
ship can always turn around and come back," said retired Capt. James Bush, a 
26-year Navy veteran who is the associate director for the Center for Defense 
Information in Washington. "But it's a signal to Iraq that we are in for the 
long haul, though it's not too costly for us." 
</P>
<P>
The ship, whose 1,200-member crew includes 308 women, will not be deployed to 
an area with heavy fighting should combat erupt, since it is a repair vessel 
with little ability to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We would want to be in a central area where ships could get to us and some 
protection is afforded," said Capt. Larry King, the Acadia's commanding 
officer, who emphasized that he could not discuss the possibility of the 
Acadia's deployment. Navy officials were unwilling to be specific about when 
the ship might leave. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's crew repairs vessels, whether steam- or nuclear-powered, that float 
by its side. The Acadia also can provide services to other ships' crews, such 
as medical care, or supplies such as drinking water and food. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials say 140 female sailors serve aboard support vessels in the North 
Arabian Sea. Of those, 34 are aboard the San Francisco-based ammunition ship 
Flint. The Flint, however, was already in the region when the Middle East 
crisis heated up and did not sail from the West Coast. Since U.S. law prohibits 
women from participating in combat, those deployed in the Persian Gulf area 
serve in support roles, in roles such as welders and electricians. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the women aboard the Acadia said they resented the attention they had 
drawn because they are women sailors. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have been on ships like this for more than eight years -- it's annoying 
to see so much focus on women at sea rather than looking at the Navy itself," 
said the ship's navigator, a Paso Robles native who declined to give her name. 
"I just don't see what's so important about having women on a ship or sending a 
ship with women to the Persian Gulf."

FORCES BEHIND IMMIGRATION

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Powerful Economic Forces Behind Illegal Immigration" 
(editorial, Aug. 6): 
</P>
<P>
How wonderful to read of a government commission reaching practical and 
realistic conclusions. The Times' editorial and July 29 article (Opinion) by 
Diego C. Asencio and state Sen. Art Torres of the Commission for the Study of 
International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development get to the crux of 
massive migration -- jobs. 
</P>
<P>
When immigrants both legal and illegal leave homes in pleasant, uncrowded 
places to live three families in a decaying apartment there's got to be a 
reason. They are not here for the climate or the tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
As hard-working and charming as most of these people are, cities like Los 
Angeles are at the breaking point of absorption, with daily headlines citing 
lack of funds for hospitals, freeways and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Now the news of our declining prosperity bodes even more trouble. Historically, 
Americans do not welcome immigrants when times are bad. They may be out of work 
themselves. There could be some ugly scenes in large cities. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this commission for finally telling it as it is -- no quick answer. 
Excess immigration is a very serious problem for native and newcomer alike, as 
well as the country losing its best and brightest.

FORCES BEHIND IMMIGRATION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary by Asencio and Torres reveals the hidden agenda behind the 
free-trade talks with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The authors confessed it is their "hope that fostering (economic) growth in 
migrant-sending countries (like Mexico) would eliminate the need to enforce our 
immigration laws." 
</P>
<P>
This call for open borders has been a frequent cry from voices on both sides of 
the border. For example, Mexico wants more than just free trade. President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari has indicated he wants to see the "free movement of 
labor" as a part of any trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, many politicos in this country are also hoping to get more than a 
free trade agreement with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The trade talks with Mexico involve more than meets the eye. Many want an 
open-border agreement, and some even want to achieve a political harmonization 
with Mexico. American citizens should beware.

ANIMAL TRAINER CRUELTY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Colorful pageantry disguises the fact that animals used in circuses are mere 
captives, forced to perform unnatural and often painful acts . . . they would 
quickly lose their appeal if the details of the animals' treatment, 
confinement, training and 'retirement' became widely known." Thus People for 
the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA) position paper on "Circuses: Three 
Rings of Abuse," begins. 
</P>
<P>
Besides spending much of their lives in cages, legally required to be only 
large enough for the animals to stand and turn around, in transit the climatic 
conditions around the country force the animals to face radical shifts of both 
heat and cold (bears especially suffer from heat, lions from cold) that would 
not normally be encountered under "free range" (natural) conditions. During the 
off-season, animals may be kept in crates, barn stalls or trucks, as few 
circuses desire to put much money into comfortable winter housing. 
</P>
<P>
As for training, physical punishment is giving way to mental control to teach 
entertaining "tricks." However, some animals are less adaptable to various 
training techniques and are stressed enough to require drugging and tooth 
removal in order to make them manageable. As for the "tricks" themselves, bears 
balancing on balls, apes riding motorcycles, elephants standing on two legs -- 
are physically uncomfortable and behaviorally unnatural. 
</P>
<P>
After the animals have outlived their usefulness, they are permanently kept in 
winter housing, or, more likely, sold to other circuses, zoos, private 
menageries, game farms (to be shot for recreation or "exotic" meat) or even 
research laboratories. They spend the balance of their lives in confinement, 
coercion and misery. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, animals in entertainment have been restricted or banned in several 
countries, including Sweden and Denmark. In England, circuses with animal acts 
are often denied public space.

We have no guarantee that Mexico and other countries will reform their 
economies in the next 30 years and illegal immigration will subside. However, 
if we enforce our immigration laws it will awaken other countries to expedite 
economic and political reforms and address their population problems. 
</P>
<P>
Economic advancement seems to be assisted by population control. U.S. people 
are becoming resentful that our country is an escape valve for another 
country's population explosion. 
</P>
<P>
It simply is not true that we cannot stop illegal immigration now. If we make 
the effort we can have adequate barricades, we can increase the size of our 
Border Patrol and INS, levy fines and enforce deportations, all of which will 
send a clear message to unscrupulous employers and illegal aliens that our laws 
and IRCA can work and are meant to be obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
These actions will require a priority from the President and Congress. U.S. 
taxpayers are aware of the billions of tax dollars going to subsidize illegal 
aliens.

<TEXT>
<P>
In all the heated rhetoric over the newest Middle East crisis, three major 
realities have been overlooked: 
</P>
<P>
1. Had Israel not taken out the Iraqi capability to develop nuclear missiles 
some years go, the forces in Saudi Arabia might well be confronted with those 
missiles as well as chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
2. Never, in all its confrontations with the numerically superior Arab forces, 
did Israel ever ask for the deployment of even one single American GI. 
</P>
<P>
3. Yasser Arafat, in his support of Saddam Hussein, has revealed once and for 
all what he truly stands for: support of a despot who would murder men, women 
and children with gas and sacrifice untold thousands of his citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are actions for which Israel might be criticized, but the above 
realities should not be ignored.

Of all the industrial nations affected by this conflict, Japan, which imports 
virtually all of its oil, has the most to lose. Could it be possible that the 
United States is now fighting a war that was initiated by the greed of Kuwait 
and Japan? I believe that with Japan having the most to lose economically from 
this conflict that country should be one of the first to offer economic and 
military aid to achieve rapid resolution. To date, Japan has been conspicuously 
quiet.

<P>
ACTION IN THE GULF MUST NOT STOP SHORT OF REMOVING SADDAM HUSSEIN AND HIS 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, Charles Krauthammer writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is now fashionably cynical to say that the only reason the United States is 
in the Persian Gulf is oil. Oil is, of course, a major reason. But not the only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
We are living an extraordinary moment. With the abdication of Soviet power, the 
world has been transformed from a bipolar into a unipolar one. The United 
States and the alliance it leads have unprecedented control of the 
international order -- an order whose benignity and humanity have been 
testified to yet again by the rush of the newly liberated peoples of Eastern 
Europe to join it. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's Iraq presents a challenge to that order as direct as Nazi 
Germany's to the order of the 1930s. If he is permitted the unprovoked conquest 
and plunder of a defenseless neighbor, then the post-Cold War peace dissolves 
into chaos. Only this time, the nightmare will be worse and even more 
universal. It will be the nightmare not just of indiscriminate aggression but 
of indiscriminate aggression with missiles, poison gas and, soon, nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high not because this is the first test of the new unipolar 
system presided over by the West. And first tests establish ground rules. If 
Hussein gets away with swallowing Kuwait, it will be clear that this is a world 
with no rules and no one in charge. Not only will he be back for more, but 
every tyrant with ambition and an army will get the message that everything 
goes. And every potential victim will get the message that it must either arm 
itself to the teeth or, like King Hussein of Jordan, buy protection by siding 
with the regional thug of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stakes are so high, the United States has to be clear about its 
objectives in the Gulf. And because the stakes are not just oil, the objective 
has to be more than just the protection and preservation of Saudi Arabia from 
Iraq. We have three other important goals: 
</P>
<P>
* Unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, with the restoration to power 
of the emir. 
</P>
<P>
* Removal from power of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
* Elimination of Iraq's capacity for mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
This last objective -- the destruction of Iraq's unconventional capacities: its 
chemical-weapons factories, long-range missiles and nuclear-weapons facilities 
-- can be achieved only if Iraq provokes a shooting war with the United States. 
In which case, purely as a matter of self-defense, this should be our first 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of war, the United States must settle for nothing less than 
Hussein's unconditional surrender of Kuwait and his downfall. These two 
objectives are linked. The one will lead to the other. Saddam has staked so 
much on his Kuwaiti adventure that a forced, unconditional withdrawal would be 
more humiliation than his rule could endure. 
</P>
<P>
That is, if the blockade does not topple him first. Hungry people have a way of 
replacing their leaders. Hussein is not a madman. He is a cold and calculating 
thug who has this time miscalculated. Before starvation sets in, he will seek 
some face-saving compromise. Any compromise, any negotiation, any face-saving 
formula for getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait would be a grave error. 
Hussein should be granted no say in Kuwaiti affairs, no territorial or 
financial concessions, nothing that saves face. 
</P>
<P>
To save Hussein's face is to save Hussein. It would be an astonishing 
misreading of our interests, and those of a stable world order, to save an 
adventurer who, if he makes it through this crisis, will undoubtedly be back, 
next time with nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The notions of shame and honor carry extraordinary weight in Arab culture. 
Which is why we don't need secret agents or assassination plots to get rid of 
Hussein. We need only deny him an honorable retreat. He will not last long if 
he returns from little Kuwait to nothing but grieving widows, an empty 
treasury, and shame.

Present U.S. policy poses no benefit for anyone -- neither for American lives 
nor world security. The American presence and military involvement strikes a 
very sensitive chord in the political culture of the Middle Eastern states. 
</P>
<P>
Historically the Arab people have been subject to the influence and wishes of 
foreign powers. American troops in Saudi Arabia stand consistent with this 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
We want to see indigenous forces handle this conflict, particularly the Arab 
League. Indeed, the reason for the existence of the Arab League is to mediate 
these regional disputes. At the moment, the beneficiaries from this dilemma are 
the American oil companies, who really control every single drop and barrel of 
Arab oil. They are manipulating the price of this black gold on the world 
market. 
</P>
<P>
That Arabic people are yearning for democracy in their own homeland does not at 
all imply an affinity for American government and certainly not the politics of 
that government. 
</P>
<P>
How can the United States call for the immediate eradication of Iraqi 
occupation of Kuwait while remaining virtually silent about the Israeli 
occupation of the Palestinian people and their homeland? 
</P>
<P>
A policy of fairness insures a policy of true strength. We hope that the Bush 
Administration will strengthen its position through a policy of fair play. We 
hope Bush will avoid any further escalation, thus war.

RIDERSHIP ON GIANT DIPPER SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A week after its grand reopening, the Giant Dipper roller coaster has had about 
15,000 riders, and coaster officials said those numbers are meeting their 
ridership expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping to have a real busy summer, and that's what we've had," said 
Steve Rodondi, general manager of the San Diego Seaside Co., the company 
responsible for the $1.2-million restoration of the coaster. 
</P>
<P>
"If these numbers continue into the fall, we'd be ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
The historic, 65-year-old wooden roller coaster at Belmont Park was opened last 
Saturday, after initial plans for the reopening were derailed earlier in the 
week because of a faulty sprocket. 
</P>
<P>
Since its opening, the coaster, at West Mission Bay Drive and Mission 
Boulevard, has operated Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 
Fridays and Saturdays until 11 p.m. Rides cost $2. 
</P>
<P>
The coaster was closed Thursday for routine maintenance and was scheduled to be 
opened again early Friday afternoon in time for weekend crowds, Rodondi said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have been checking the coaster's track and wooden rails, as well as 
doing some oiling and greasing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just doing routine stuff we figured we'd end up doing," Rodondi said. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the riders on the coaster have been at night and on the weekend, 
with waits in line averaging about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The coaster was designated a national historic landmark by the National Park 
Service last month. DEANNA BELLANDI

OIL ISSUES

Sen. Richard H. Bryan's call for drastic increases in motor vehicle fuel 
economy as a way to assure that the U.S. won't be "hostage to the vagaries of 
Middle-East politics" ("Fuel Economy: A Shield Against New Oil Shocks," 
Commentary, Aug. 6) sidesteps too many facts to go unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
The current Middle East situation is being used by some to stampede Congress 
into taking precipitous action that would result in limited energy security 
benefits and that could be harmful to American consumers and our economy. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Bryan's bill, calling for a 40% fuel-economy increase in 
manufacturers' fleets of new cars and light trucks, would do little to reduce 
our dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
I point to the fact that today, after motor vehicle manufacturers improved fuel 
efficiency over 100%, U.S. oil imports are higher than in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The present crisis in the Middle East underscores the urgency for a 
comprehensive, broad-based energy security program. It does not call for 
singular action that would have limited benefits, but serious repercussions for 
all Americans.

Bill Veeck lives. Maybe not in reality, but at least in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped by the office one day this week dressed as Tom Day, San Diego 
State's president. He was accompanied by P.T. Barnum, who looked a lot like 
athletic director Fred Miller. 
</P>
<P>
These guys were excited by the upcoming football season . . . and not just the 
prospects for success in Al Luginbill's second year as coach and Dan McGwire's 
second (and last) year as quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, these fellows were more interested in detailing the total experience 
of attending SDSU football games. This will not be a no-frills football season. 
</P>
<P>
What Drs. Day and Miller had in hand was a program for the selling of SDSU 
football. Indeed, it filled an 18-page booklet. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is part of it," Day conceded, "but we think we can put people in the 
seats by making Aztec football a total family experience. We have to put people 
in the seats." 
</P>
<P>
Winning is a great part of it. The booklet notes that the Aztec football has 
not been major college in caliber. But the 1989 team was encouraging (6-5-1), 
and prospects for 1990 are better. 
</P>
<P>
Given the potential for improvement, SDSU does not want to make progress in a 
vacuum. It would certainly be discouraging to step up to 7-4 or even 8-3 and 
continue to average 20,000 a game. About the only thing that would be more 
discouraging would be to get folks interested and finish 4-7 or 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, here is the menu, from hors d'oeuvres to entree to dessert, for 
SDSU football in 1990 . . . 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 15 vs. Cal State Long Beach: 
</P>
<P>
This game figures to be a tough sell, because CSLB is a few notches below what 
anyone hereabouts perceives as a major college opponent. It will be a tougher 
sell should the Aztecs stink up the joint in Oregon in their season opener 
Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
However . . . this game, followed by fireworks, will honor the return of George 
Allen, 72, as the 49ers' coach. If the combined score is higher than Allen's 
age, each ticket stub is good for free pizza. (No joke!) Of course, that will 
also mean the defense is as bad as it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the score, fans will get free Aztec cups. A pregame reception is 
scheduled for alums who were graduated before 1950, which would make them 
contemporaries of most of Allen's professional players. 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 29 vs. Air Force: 
</P>
<P>
The visitors get a little snub here, because Navy jets will fly over before the 
game. Pregame activities also will honor alums who were graduated since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be followed by a paper-airplane throwing contest, which may seem 
like an invitation to a gigantic mess. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Minnesota Twins have had such a promotion for seven years and a 
spokesman for them was enthusiastic: "It looks like Times Square on New Year's 
Eve." 
</P>
<P>
The paper-airplane throwing contest will be followed by a concert, though the 
attraction has not been announced. May we suggest Guy Lombardo's band? 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 3 vs. Utah: 
</P>
<P>
Homecoming! Walk in the gate and get a pom pon. Buy your game program and get a 
free Aztec water bottle. Listen to oldies music and watch Great Moments in 
Aztec sports (most of them pre-1980) on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 10 vs. Hawaii: 
</P>
<P>
Can San Diego do a beach party or what? Wear beach clothes, watch beach movie 
outtakes and listen to surf music. In fact, everyone wearing a Hawaiian shirt 
gets a neon (gasp!) Aztec visor. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment will be by the OB Geriatric Surfboard Team. (No, George Allen 
does not coach the OB Geriatrics.) 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 24 vs. UTEP: 
</P>
<P>
A country carnival begins in the parking lot at 3 p.m. Notice how these 
promotions tend to spin off the geography or identity of the visiting team? 
Heaven knows how a visit by USC might be promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Alum letter winners also will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
* Dec. 1 vs. Miami: 
</P>
<P>
Ta da! The defending national champions come to town for the season finale. 
Great moments in college football will be featured on the scoreboard, but not 
likely on the field. 
</P>
<P>
High school bands will play at halftime, but the kids figure to be a little 
young to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks likely will follow both the opening kickoff and the game. 
</P>
<P>
This is also Fan Appreciation Night, and that's really what this whole 
marketing program is all about. SDSU is trying to position itself so that (a) 
it gives its fans more to appreciate and (b) it ends up with more fans for it 
to appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
Promotions, to be sure, have long been a part of sports, but SDSU has given 
them a little twist here and there. These gimmicks will not fill the stadium, 
but maybe, combined with continued improvement by the football team, they can 
accelerate the process.

NEW TEAM, OLD GLEAM FOR MURPHY; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: DALE MURPHY HAS CHANGED TEAMS, FROM THE ATLANTA BRAVES TO THE 
PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES, BUT HE HASN'T CHANGED HIS COLORS. HIS HOMER LED THE 
PHILLIES TO A 2-1 VICTORY. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre fans had read the news, and some had seen the news reports, but they 
really couldn't believe it for themselves until they saw it Friday night with 
their own eyes. 
</P>
<P>
They nudged one another, saying it sure looked like him. He was even wearing 
good ol' No. 3. But instead of a tomahawk on the front of his jersey, he was 
wearing a crimson and gray uniform, and red shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that was Dale Murphy returning to haunt Padre fans as a member of the 
Philadelphia Phillies, leading his new teammates to a 2-1 victory over the 
Padres in front of 18,488 fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who was traded from Atlanta to the Phillies two weeks ago, might look 
different with his new uniform, and he's struggling more than ever this season, 
but it's the same ol' Murph, hitting a mammoth third-inning home run that went 
about 20 rows up the left-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 58th home run of his career against the Padres, and his 24th homer 
at San Diego Jack Murphy, the most by any opposing player in the 22-year 
history of the stadium, surpassing the 23-homer total by Hall of Fame catcher 
Johnny Bench of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
It was Murphy's first home in 16 games, his last occurring July 31 against 
Padre pitcher Eric Show, but most important to him was that this was his first 
as a member of the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, my first one with my new team," Murphy said, "feels a lot like my 
first one ever. It feels good. Real good." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy just so happens to have 372 homers in his career, but after failing to 
hit a homer in 52 at-bats since joining the Phillies, Manager Nick Leyva told 
him to quit experimenting with his stance, and go back to where he feels 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
He singled in his first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
He homered in his second. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked like geniuses, didn't we?" Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Phillies' front office is looking awfully wise. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a month ago when they went on their search for a cleanup hitter. 
They talked with several teams, and for a while, looked as if they might swing 
a deal for Padre first baseman Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked," General Manager Lee Thomas said. "We were interested in Clark as a 
cleanup hitter. But we might have wanted him to play the outfield, and I don't 
know if Jack would have wanted to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's any secret that there are a lot of teams that would like to 
have Jack Clark. I hear people saying how Clark (who was sidelined with a 
ligament tear in his right ankle) didn't want to play in the '87 World Series. 
I'll tell you what, if he could have played, he would have been out there. 
There's no question in mind mind. That's what kind of player he is. Everyone 
wants a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Leyva: "Yeah, there were other (No.) 4-hitters available, but some would 
have taken half of our ballclub to get them." 
</P>
<P>
So the Phillies settled on Murphy, a two-time National League MVP and 
seven-time All-Star, signed him to a two-year, $5 million contract extension, 
and put him in right field. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't pay a guy $2 1/2 million a year if we don't think he can produce," 
Leyva said. "I think he'll be just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's homer tied the game at 1 in the third inning, and then it was left to 
Dickie Thon, one of four former Padres on the Phillies, to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
Thon, who was sold to the Phillies after the 1988 season, led off the sixth 
inning with a triple to right-center. Padre pitcher Calvin Schiraldi, who had 
pulled off a marvelous Houdini act all game, kept Thon standing at third when 
he induced a shallow fly ball by pitcher Jose DeJesus and a bouncer back to the 
mound by Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
But the magic finally ended for Schiraldi -- who allowed 14 baserunners in six 
innings, including six walks, the most by a Padre pitcher this season -- when 
he yielded a ground ball by catcher Darren Daulton that squirted into right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
While the focus Friday night might have been on Murphy playing in San Diego for 
the first time as a Phillie, the Padres got a close-hand look at a new pitcher 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
That would be DeJesus, who is 6-foot-5, 180 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the name. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus, the latest pitcher the Kansas City Royals have allowed to escape their 
system, pitched a six-hit complete-game. It was his fourth victory of the 
season, and the way his 98-m.p.h. fastball and hard slider come across the 
plate, there might be a lot more victories where those come from. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember facing the guy in Puerto Rico about 1984, 1985," Padre catcher 
Benito Santiago said. "But I couldn't remember what kind of pitcher he was." 
</P>
<P>
Now he knows, along with the rest of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus, who entered the game with 41 walks in 66 innings, told himself the 
moment he set foot in San Diego not to walk anyone. "I must have told myself 
that five times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he goes out in the first inning, gives up a leadoff single to his buddy, 
Roberto Alomar, and another to Tony Gwynn, and is down 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I told myself, well, at least I'm not walking anybody," DeJesus, 25, said. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus faced 29 more batters after Gwynn's hit, and just four managed to reach 
base. The only other trouble he encountered came in the ninth when he struck 
out Joe Carter after Carter hit a long foul. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' offense was shut down again, and after 46 innings on this home 
stand, they have scored just 10 runs, including a meager three extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Schiraldi hit a two-out double off the yellow striping above the 
left-field fence in the fifth inning, it was the first extra-base hit by a 
Padre player other than Joe Carter in 40 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have successfully been able to clear waivers with all of their 
submitted players, according to league sources, making them available to trade 
before Aug. 31 deadline when playoffs rosters are frozen. It used to be a 
gentleman's agreement that no one ever claimed anyone's players on the waiver 
wire, making them available for clearance, but this year, sources say, about 25 
major league players have been claimed on waivers since July 31. . . . Robbie 
Beckett, the Padres' first-round selection in the 1990 June free agent draft, 
was promoted to the Padres' Class A club in Riverside and pitched Friday night 
against Bakersfield, allowing seven hits, eight runs and six walks in 4 2/3 
innings. . . . The Padres have decided to eliminate their team in the Arizona 
Instructional League. The reasoning, the Padres say, is that the benefit of the 
two months of play for the minor leaguers was not worth the $250,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
Ever so quietly, Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn is putting together the highest 
RBI total of his career. Gwynn already has 57 RBIs this season, just five fewer 
than his total all of last year. If he continues on this pace, Gwynn will 
finish with 79 RBIs, eight more than his career-high of 71 set in 1984. 
Although he says it would take a miracle to win the batting title this season, 
trailing Phillie outfielder Lenny Dykstra by 30 points, .346-.316, Gwynn said 
he'd have a shot at his fourth consecutive title if he can close to within 20 
points by the start of September . . . Phillie first baseman John Kruk tried to 
pull a prank on Padre pitcher Ed Whitson by telephoning him in the wee hours 
Friday morning, only to find out that Whitson had already left his house at 
4:30 a.m. for a fishing expedition. "Tell him, nice try anyway," Whitson said. 
"Hey, what was he doing up so early, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Just what kind of luck is Whitson having this season? He owns the second-lowest 
ERA in the National League at 2.53. He has 20 quality starts in 24 appearances 
-- pitching at least six inning while yielding three or fewer runs. He has 
allowed just 17 earned runs in his past 10 starts? So what does he have to show 
for it? A 9-7 record, thanks to his teammates scoring two or fewer runs in 10 
of his starts, and more than four runs in just five starts. . . . The Padres 
have been involved in 16 extra-inning games this season, including three in the 
past six games, the most since 1985. . . . The Padres will play the second game 
of their three-game series against the Phillies at 7:05 p.m. today. Andy Benes 
(8-8) will make his first start for the Padres since Aug. 7. Tommy Greene (1-0) 
will make his first start for the Phillies, becoming the 11th starting pitcher 
they have employed this season.

HIGHEST PRAISE FROM ONE COACH TO ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Aug. 11 edition carried an article concerning the controversy surrounding 
the dismissal of Ollie Butler (as basketball coach) at Victor Valley High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Having coached on the college level for 15 seasons, I have frequently seen 
Coach Butler's teams in action, recruited his players and worked with him at 
summer camps. On all of these occasions, Coach Butler has conducted himself in 
a professional manner, worthy of the high esteem in which he is held. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say that I wish my son could play for Ollie Butler.

BREAKING UP THE KINGS NOT A SOUND DECISION

<P>
I can't believe the Kings are breaking up the best announcing team in Los 
Angeles. By demoting Nick Nickson to radio only and replacing him with former 
player and rookie broadcaster Jim Fox, King fans come up big losers. With Bob 
Miller and Nick you were always sure to get an accurate and honest call of the 
game, with no cheerleading.

Trying to watch golf on ABC during the PGA was futile. 
</P>
<P>
The most important aspect of this tournament to ABC was obviously the 
controversy about blacks not belonging to country clubs. I have never been so 
sick of a subject. They beat it to death Friday night instead of showing the 
tournament; they beat it to death Saturday and Sunday. It would be nice to be 
able to watch some of the tournament.

RECRUITING STORIES CAN HAVE DIFFERENT ENDING SECOND TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Harrick, criticized by some earlier in the year for the Bruins' poor 
recruiting, looks like a genius now because he had a stockpile of scholarship 
money available for Southern California's top two prep players, Ed O'Bannon and 
Shon Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
While at Pepperdine, Harrick benefited from transfers such as Jon Korfas, Tom 
Lewis and Dwayne Polee. Coaches do not always win the recruiting war the first 
time around, but, in some instances, there is a long-term benefit for finishing 
a close second.

In the Viewpoint letters Aug. 11, Sandy Cohen stated that the media had blown 
the Shoal Creek situation out of proportion and that a more urgent need was to 
" . . . educate young blacks so that they can get better jobs and economically 
have their own private clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more urgent is the need to educate whites, both young and old, so 
that there will be no more private clubs like Shoal Creek.

BUSTER DOUGLAS JUST DOING WHAT WILL SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Mike Downey believes Buster Douglas is blowing his image (Aug. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because he is doing what every other athlete does, and that is to psych 
himself up by mouthing off, with expectations of generating interest and 
building the gate. 
</P>
<P>
As Muhammad Ali said, "If your opponent listened to all of your hype and 
rhetoric, you already have the edge going into the fight." 
</P>
<P>
I seriously doubt if we will have another "Ah was lucky," a la Joe Louis or 
Rocky Marciano. The name of the game today is hype.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW? SAM AND STEVE CVIJANOVICH;

<P>
TOAST OF THE TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER SANTA CLARA ATHLETES SCORE POINTS AS SALOON OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buried in a hamper full of damp towels, Sam Cvijanovich held his breath. Not so 
much because the hamper stunk but because his father would find him if he made 
so much as a peep. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Cvijanovich burst into the locker room, looked around, and, not seeing Sam, 
cursed under his breath and headed back to the basketball gym. It was only the 
third quarter and Santa Clara High had a game to win, Sam or no Sam. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for his father wasn't easy, Sam mused as he climbed out of the hamper 
and sprinted home. But he had no choice: Lou was varsity football, basketball 
and baseball coach at Santa Clara and Sam was a three-sport athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Sam knew he shouldn't have talked back during the game, but he had been taught 
to speak his mind. And he wasn't surprised that Lou had chased him across the 
court and into the locker room in full view of the Santa Clara faithful. Like 
father, like son. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the episode from the stands was Steve Cvijanovich, a ninth-grader 
three years younger than Sam. On that winter evening in 1967, Steve vowed to 
have more sense than his brother; to this day he swears he has never defied his 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three years later, Lou knows exactly where to find his eldest son. His 
name is on the door: Sam's Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Steve is there too. He has been Sam's partner since they bought a biker hangout 
10 years ago and transformed it into a classic sports bar complete with five 
satellite dishes and 12 TV sets. Every NFL football game is shown here. 
</P>
<P>
The saloon's location -- two blocks from Santa Clara High in Oxnard -- is 
perfect for the close-knit Cvijanovich family. The Saints have won back-to-back 
state Division IV basketball championships under Lou, 63, who will begin his 
33rd season as coach this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sam and Steve, the eldest of Lou and Martha's eight children, dabbled in 
coaching after graduating from Cal Lutheran but pursued another family 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grandpa ran a bar in Jerome, Arizona. It's in our blood, it was destined 
to happen," said Steve, 37, who lives with Sam, 40, a few miles from the 
saloon. Neither is married and their parents still loom large in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Sam and Steve were busy readying the saloon for its 4 p.m. opening a few days 
ago when the first customer walked in. The glance they shot each other was 
unmistakable: Dad's home. 
</P>
<P>
Lou, sweating from a day of coaching summer basketball, ambles behind the bar 
and helps himself to a light beer. Three more patrons soon pull up bar stools. 
Lou motions for Steve to set them up with drinks. "Thanks, coach," they say in 
unison as Lou plunks down a bill to cover the round. 
</P>
<P>
Sam's Saloon is a second home for the Cvijanoviches and a comfortable spot for 
sports fans to spend an evening. Hundreds of caps are pinned to the ceiling and 
the walls are covered with photos, football helmets and jerseys, many of them 
given to Sam and Steve by friends and former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
A walk around the saloon, in fact, is a journey through the Cvijanovich 
brothers' playing careers. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Bauer's San Diego Chargers jersey hangs from the ceiling. Steve 
Cvijanovich was Bauer's roommate at Cal Lutheran in 1972 and Hank's brother Jim 
worked as a bartender at Sam's for years. "I broke Hank's nose in a rugby game, 
that's why it's so pretty now. He had plastic surgery," Sam said with a gleeful 
cackle. 
</P>
<P>
On another wall is a 10-year-old framed and autographed photo of New York 
Giants linebackers Brian Kelley, Lawrence Taylor, Harry Carson and Brad Van 
Pelt. Kelley lined up alongside Sam in 1971 during Cal Lutheran's NAIA 
championship season. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Las Vegas jersey worn in last year's NCAA basketball final by 
Stacey, the youngest Cvijanovich brother, is displayed nearby. Lou points to a 
plaque hidden in a far corner. "There's the most valuable thing in this bar," 
he booms. The award is Stacey's for finishing fifth in the national Pass, Punt 
and Kick competition a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Absent is memorabilia from Sam's four-year Canadian Football League career. In 
1974, he was CFL Rookie of the Year as a middle linebacker with the Toronto 
Argonauts. But he donated his uniform and helmet to an auction benefiting a 
cancer foundation in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent, however, are team photos of the Los Angeles Raiders, whose summer 
training camp is in Oxnard. For several years, the Raiders held air hockey 
tournaments at Sam's Saloon and players and coaches still pop in. 
</P>
<P>
Visits from former Santa Clara and Cal Lutheran teammates give Sam and Steve 
their greatest pleasure. Both went to the Thousand Oaks college after 
graduating high school. On the '71 championship team, Sam, a senior nicknamed 
"Jawbone," was captain and spiritual leader. Steve, a freshman, started at 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the old Cal Lutheran guys can drive through Ventura County without 
stopping at the bar," said Gene Uebelhardt, the fullback on the '71 team and 
now the Royal High football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Uebelhardt, in fact, dropped by this week after a round of golf. Sitting in the 
saloon, he is overwhelmed by familiarity and fond memories, like the day in 
1977 when Steve pulled up in his Volkswagen square-back and told Uebelhardt to 
hop in for a quick ride. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-eight hours later, we were in Vancouver watching Sam play a CFL game," 
Uebelhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
That season was Sam's last. He set a league record for interceptions by a 
linebacker (seven) as a rookie and played three seasons in Toronto before being 
traded to Vancouver. Foot injuries ended his 1977 season early and he retired. 
</P>
<P>
He played long enough in Canada to gain a measure of revenge for his most 
painful high school loss, though. Rocky Long, the quarterback who led Alta Loma 
to victory over Santa Clara in the 1967 playoff semifinals, returned a punt for 
the British Columbia Lions in a game against Toronto and became reacquainted 
with Cvijanovich. 
</P>
<P>
"I tackled him and knocked him out of the game," Sam recalled. "While he was 
lying there, I told him, 'That's for beating me in high school.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tenacity and competitiveness that marked the Cvijanoviches on the field has 
served them well in business. The saloon makes enough money that its business 
hours have been trimmed over the years from 20 to 10 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Sam and Steve would like to cut off another 10 hours. That's right, the tavern 
soon might be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it corporate burnout," Sam said, grinning. "We've been talking about 
getting into coaching, maybe at the junior college level." 
</P>
<P>
They probably will join the same staff if they do. As a team, Sam and Steve 
Cvijanovich are tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"Their names are synonymous with one another," Uebelhardt said. "You don't talk 
about one without the other. It's always Sam and Steve. They are a credit to 
brotherly love everywhere."

WEST LEADS, 3-0, IN THIRD-ROUND LEGION CONTEST

UNION CITY, Calif.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching a seemingly endless game between New Mexico and Utah on Friday night, 
Woodland Hills West right-hander Corey Bromberg uttered what was meant to be a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
After New Mexico had taken a two-run lead in the top of the 13th inning and a 
Utah batter had come up with a man on, Bromberg -- waiting to start West's 
third-round game in the American Legion Southwest regional tournament -- said: 
</P>
<P>
"If this kid hits it out, I'm not pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Boom. Gone. The home run delayed the start of West's game against host Union 
City until 10:22 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At press time, West held a 3-0 lead with Union City batting against Bromberg 
with one out in the top of the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
A loss would have sent West into an elimination game against Hawaii at 4 p.m. 
today. Hawaii, which trailed, 10-0, at one point, rallied to defeat Arizona, 
17-16, Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would have guaranteed West a berth in Sunday's final round. West, 
which would have improved to 3-0 in the double-elimination tournament with a 
victory late Friday, would play a 7 p.m. game with New Mexico today. 
</P>
<P>
In an elimination game that lasted 5 hours 20 minutes, New Mexico defeated 
Utah, 14-10, in 16 innings. 
</P>
<P>
West scored a run without a hit in the bottom of the first on consecutive walks 
to Paul Geller, Jeff Marks and Del Marine and a sacrifice fly by Bobby Kim. 
</P>
<P>
West again loaded the bases against Union City right-hander Bob Pailthorpe in 
the third and got more mileage out of this threat than it did in the first. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Marine singled to left on an 0-2 pitch and moved to second when 
Union City third baseman Jeff Borges bobbled Jason Cohen's grounder in the 
hole. Kim worked out of an 0-2 hole to draw a walk, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Greg Lederman, who jokingly has started referring to himself as 
"Stickman," drove in Marine and Cohen with a line single to right field to give 
West a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Through three innings, Bromberg had allowed three baserunners, one via a base 
hit and two because of infield errors.

WHITE JOINS CAL AT PRACTICE AFTER GAINING HIS ELIGIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Trying to create an impact such as he could not make last year, running back 
Russell White donned a Cal practice jersey for the first time Friday. The 
Crespi High record-setter was ineligible to play football for the Golden Bears 
last season under terms of Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else wants to know, 'Who is Russell White and what can he do on the 
college level?' " said White, who on Friday morning completed an English 
requirement, his last obstacle to eligibility. "But I want to know myself." 
</P>
<P>
White, who chose Cal over USC, established a state high school rushing record 
of 5,998 yards at Crespi, including 2,339 yards and 31 touchdowns his sophomore 
year. 
</P>
<P>
On letter-of-intent signing day, White claimed that he could win the Heisman 
Trophy his freshman year and eventually lead Cal to a Rose Bowl. But after 
failing four times to score the minimum requirement of 700 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, he became a Prop. 48 casualty and was unable to participate in 
practices or games until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lost when I said that," White said of his signing-day boast. "I wish I 
could take it back, but I can't turn back the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Now a sophomore after losing a year of eligibility, White comes into Cal's 
training camp third on the depth chart behind senior Anthony Wallace and 
redshirt freshman Lindsey Chapman. Wallace ran for 560 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
White said that being a Prop. 48 casualty was the best thing that could have 
happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was coming here, I was going to finish (earn a degree), because that's 
the way I've been brought up," White said. "Don't start something you can't 
finish. If you don't have a degree from a university, you can't do much in 
life. I want to eat sirloin." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears, 4-7 a year ago, open their season at Wisconsin on Sept. 8.

RUELAS SEALS WALTERS' FATE IN 9TH TO SET UP A TITLE FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: ARLETA TEEN-AGER RUNS RECORD TO 20-0 WITH OVERPOWERING PERFORMANCE 
AGAINST JAMAICAN FEATHERWEIGHT.

<P>
Job Walters, a swift and muscular Jamaican featherweight who had easily whipped 
former world champions in his past two bouts, was a fighter on his way up. 
</P>
<P>
But just seconds after running into a crushing left hook from Rafael Ruelas of 
Arleta, he was a fighter on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, 19, dropped Walters early in the first round, then stopped him with a 
blistering barrage of punches in the ninth Friday night in a scheduled 10-round 
bout at Bally's Hotel. Ruelas used the overpowering performance to run his 
record to 20-0 with 17 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
The victory set up Ruelas' first shot at a title. He is scheduled to fight Pee 
Wee Parker of Los Angeles in November at the Forum for the International Boxing 
Council featherweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's bout ended 2 minutes 10 seconds into the ninth after Ruelas had 
blasted Walters, who fights out of New York, with stinging combinations from 
the start of the round. He staggered Walters with a whistling left hook and as 
Walters sagged against the ropes, Ruelas unleashed a furious combination, 
snapping back the head of the defenseless Walters seconds before referee Toby 
Gibson jumped in and stopped the beating. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, 126 1/2, who entered the bout ranked 20th in the featherweight division 
by the World Boxing Council, was ahead by five points on the scorecards of two 
judges and by three points on the third scorecard after eight rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 125, came into the bout off a pair of impressive wins over former 
world champions Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela and Azael Moran of New York. 
Moreover, he had not lost a fight in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
He withstood the punishment that Ruelas was handing out in the early rounds, 
and, after the first-round knockdown, he began landing solid punches of his own 
to win a few rounds. But none of the punches seemed to bother his opponent and 
by the fifth round Ruelas -- a tall featherweight at 5-foot-10 -- had regained 
control. His quick and heavy jabs nearly closed Walter's right eye in the sixth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Walters' swollen eye began to bleed heavily and Ruelas began a 
heavy attack, rocking Walters with stiff jabs and left hooks to the body and 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard because he moved a lot and stayed busy," said Ruelas, who fights 
out of the Ten Goose Boxing Club of Van Nuys. "But I thought I was in control 
throughout the fight. He never hurt me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy. I'm really pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas won 50 of 55 amateur bouts before starting his professional career just 
19 months ago, fighting mostly at The Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Gabriel Ruelas -- Rafael's 20-year-old brother -- had his career put 
on hold when he sustained a freak injury during a bout against Jeff Franklin in 
Las Vegas. In that fight, Gabriel Ruelas, who had piled up a 20-0 record, 
sustained a broken bone in his arm and underwent surgery on his elbow a day 
later.

TO LEARN BURNSIDE'S SECRET, ASK ANY MERMAID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Burnside doesn't mind letting you in on his secret: 
</P>
<P>
He cheated last year in becoming Grand Champion of the World Body Surfing 
Championships (WBSC) at the Oceanside Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Burnside, of Palm Desert, said so himself Friday at the beginning of this 
year's 14th annual contest that has attracted nearly 400 body surfers from 
throughout California, Hawaii and even Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
How else could it be explained that a 57-year-old man emerged as world champion 
-- by far the oldest ever -- against competitors like five-time champ Mike 
Cunningham of Gardena, who competes in the 25-34 age group, and teen-agers such 
as T.J. McIver of Laguna Hills and Andy Law of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Not the least bit apologetic, Burnside confessed: "I have a little mermaid out 
there that guides me around. She tells me where to go and when to go. Without 
her, I'd be a little minnow in a pool of sharks." 
</P>
<P>
There you have it. Truth be known. Burnside's a cheater, even though no where 
in the rules does it state, that a body surfer can't apply the help of a 
mermaid. That's Bob. 
</P>
<P>
Guess 30 years of experience as a lifeguard for the county of Los Angeles had 
its advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was his work as a member of the world's first underwater recovery 
team in the 1950s. Those five guys, without precedent, set the standard for the 
way dead bodies are located and recovered in the seas. Burnside said they had 
about a 75% success rate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is where Burnside met his lady friend. Help or no help, his feat 
at last year's championships was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Why, he even survived a maneuver called "shooting the pier" -- a dangerous and 
illegal move where a body surfer gets sucked under the pier and into the 
hazardous pillars. 
</P>
<P>
Burnside may want to think twice if his mermaid guides him that way again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Spectacular. It really was," said Dave Carter, a retired high school principal 
who witnessed the accidental stunt. "The old-timers on the pier really gave him 
a rousing ovation for that one." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill Missett, a director of the WBSC, "We consider him lucky to be able to 
maneuver himself through a dangerous condition. He is shrewd. He's a shrewd 
competitor, and he's very sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Said Burnside of his accomplishment, "Winning the championship sort of capped 
the whole year. I had gone undefeated in every contest (five) up till then. But 
even then my goal was just to win my age bracket. I had no concept of winning 
the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"To win that, at my age, was gratifying . . . damn gratifying. I've know a lot 
of those kids since the day they were born. Mike Cunningham and (two-time Grand 
Champion) Tim Casinelli (of Leucadia), I knew their dads." 
</P>
<P>
Burnside had other advantages, too, that his younger counterparts did not. 
</P>
<P>
Retired for the past seven years, Burnside has plenty of time to train. He 
swims every day, rides bicycles and runs occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Since he lives in Palm Desert, he doesn't have an ocean readily available, but 
he does have a good deal of friends up and down the coast that lend him a bed 
whenever a good swell kicks up. 
</P>
<P>
And in the winter, it's off to the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
An avid skier, Burnside moved to Mammoth from Los Angeles when he retired from 
lifeguarding as the county's deputy director of operations, the second highest 
position in the field. 
</P>
<P>
He went there not only to ski, but to compete. In 1987, he won the overall 
Western United States master's division points championship in the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
But the next year, he blew out his knee and shoulder in a spectacular crash. He 
took last year off because of the injuries, but plans on competing again this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Burnside used to play water polo in the 1940s for El Segundo High and USC. He 
also competes in masters' swimming events, and last week won the 100-meter back 
stroke in the Southern Pacific Assn. long course championships. 
</P>
<P>
Through lifeguarding, diving and dealing in rare automobiles, Burnside has 
built a rather comfortable nest egg for himself, his wife, Annette, and his 
yellow Labrador retriever, Molly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want for anything," he said. "I have a nice house, an attractive wife, 
two daughters and eight grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention his little fish-tailed friend in the water. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Competition in the World Body Surfing Championships, which began Friday for the 
younger age divisions, continues today and Sunday beginning at 6:30 a.m. on 
both sides of the Oceanside Pier. . . . Tim Casinelli of Leucadia, David Ross 
of Carlsbad, Keith Hoffman of San Diego and Chris Dunn of Oceanside won their 
first-round heats Friday in the men's 18-24 division. John Paul O'Neill of 
Chula Vista won his heat in the men's 15-17 division, and Juniper Fitzgerald of 
Encinitas took hers in the women's 12-17 division. . . . The Chargers' new 
general manager, Bobby Beathard, another El Segundo High graduate, competed in 
the contest in 1989. Unfortunately, he's a little too busy this year.

SWAI HOPES COMEBACK TRAIL INCLUDES VICTORY IN HALF MARATHON

<P>
Alphonce Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania, but who later fell 
prey to alcoholism, continues his comeback bid in Sunday's America's Finest 
City HomeFed Half Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The race is scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. at the Cabrillo Monument atop the 
Point Loma Peninsula. It will wind its way to the finish line in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Swai began his comeback in late May when he ran the Trib 10K, finishing 16th in 
30 minutes 8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Swai has won two races, the Coronado Half Marathon in 
July, which he finished in 1:04.50, and the Goodwill Games 10-kilometer run 
last month in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games victory came despite Swai's taking a wrong turn and running 
150 yards in another direction before getting back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Now Swai, 26, is looking to turn in a 1:02 or 1:03 on Sunday. He insists he'll 
need that kind of a time to beat a bevy of Mexican and African runners. 
</P>
<P>
The runners Swai fears most include: 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ayala of Mexico City, who finished fourth in this year's Grandma's 
Marathon; Jose Luis Chuela of Mexico, who was second in this race in 1988 
(1:03:42); Sam Sitonik of Kenya, who placed fourth in the 1987 America's Finest 
City Half Marathon at 1:06:01; and Sammy Rotich, a Kenyan who ran a personal 
best 1:01:55 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The women's field is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash. Track &amp; Field News 
ranked Jones third among women marathoners in 1989 and first among U.S. 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 32, finished the 1989 New York City Marathon second to Ingrid 
Kristiansen of Norway with a personal-best time of 2:27.54. Also in 1989, Jones 
won the Twin Cities Marathon, placed second in Houston and third in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
She will be challenged by Janine Aiello of Toas, N.M., who placed second in 
this year's San Francisco Marathon; Lynn DeNinnof of St. Louis, who won a gold 
medal in the 10 kilometer at the 1990 TAC championships; and Kathryn Evans of 
Fort Collins, Colo., winner of the 1990 Nebraska Half Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The course is considered by runners to be a difficult one -- so difficult, in 
fact, that most elite runners who train in San Diego stay away from the race. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a challenging course," Swai said. "The runner who is smart and thinks 
through it will be the one who is going to win. You can't just go out and run 
hard on this course."

BOLSHOI TO ADD 'GISELLE' FOR S.D. AUDIENCES; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: MEMBERS OF THE 214-YEAR-OLD TROUPE WILL BE VISITING SAN DIEGO FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE THE 1960S, BRINGING TWO FULL-LENGTH BALLETS THAT DATE BACK TO 
THE 19TH CENTURY.

<P>
The dancers in the Bolshoi Ballet may be feeling the pinch of the political and 
social unrest going on back home in the Soviet Union. But the San Diego 
performances -- the first since the 1960s -- of the 214-year-old bastion of 
classical dance will conjure the make-believe world of ballet, abundant with 
fairy-tale fervor, ghostly otherworldliness and elaborate spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
During their run at the Civic Theatre beginning Tuesday, the Moscow-based 
company will perform two full-length ballets that date back to the 19th Century 
-- the golden age of Russian ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"Swan Lake," which completes its run at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on 
Sunday, will inaugurate the Bolshoi's San Diego visit, and will be performed 
three times Tuesday through Thursday. Friday through Sunday, the company will 
perform the only four California stagings of "Giselle." 
</P>
<P>
The version of "Giselle" in preparation for the Civic Theatre this weekend 
bears the personal stamp of Yuri Grigorovich, artistic director and chief 
choreographer of the Bolshoi since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
However, Grigorovich claims little credit for the old chestnut's new look. He 
considers the changes to be a unifying factor, linking the classic to its 
finest Russian roots. 
</P>
<P>
"My main goal was to go back to the original -- forward to (Marius) Petipa," 
the gregarious Grigorovich joked during an interview in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I put more of the dancing on pointe," he said, referring to all the peasant 
dancing in Act I, "because in my opinion, that gives it more stylistic unity" 
with the pointe work of the otherworldly Wilis in Act II. "I also changed some 
mime scenes, adding more choreography," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Charlton, co-chairwoman of Entertainment Corp. U.S.A., which 
represents the Bolshoi in the United States, described Grigorovich's emphasis 
on stronger dance values as a major innovation that separates the Bolshoi's 
production from other contemporary "Giselle's," including the recent staging of 
"Giselle" performed by the Australian Ballet in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't hang around," Charlton stressed. "There's a lot more dance in this 
'Giselle.' We go straight into the dance, and even the minor roles are played 
by Bolshoi soloists. We have to, with all those top-notch dancers in the 
company. Western ballet companies can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
The ballerina role in "Giselle," with its formidable dramatic and technical 
challenges, is the most coveted in the classic repertory, and the dancers 
slated to perform the role in San Diego are among the Bolshoi's most 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
Nina Semizorova, a protege of the famous Galina Ulanova and a Bolshoi ballerina 
since 1978, is one of the stars tagged for the San Diego staging. Semizorova 
will dance the title role on opening night with Alexander Vetrov as Albrecht, 
and again during the Bolshoi's final San Diego performance with her danseur 
husband Mark Peretokin. 
</P>
<P>
Semizorova and Peretokin were in San Diego earlier this summer to talk about 
their upcoming appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I will dance both ballets here," Semizorova said of "Giselle" and "Swan Lake," 
speaking through an interpreter as she savored a dish of fresh raspberries and 
cream at the Westgate Hotel -- an uncommon luxury in the Soviet Union, she 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
" "Giselle" is brilliant, and I love it very much, but it is very complicated. 
</P>
<P>
"Grigorovich's version of 'Giselle' has new choreography and much more pointe 
work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have new sets and costumes, which are only 3 years old. They are all 
historically accurate, but they're new." 
</P>
<P>
"They were made for Paris," Charlton added. "And they're very lavish. But the 
most important thing is the change in the company. You no longer have to keep 
the dancers for 20 years -- whether they're good or not. Now, they're much 
younger on the average." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there is change," Grigorovich said . "Thank God, they have changed 
since 1966. But we need more changes if we are to survive. And we still need a 
contract system (to increase the salaries) of the dancers." 
</P>
<P>
"There's been tremendous upheaval," Charlton acknowledged. "Yuri is not going 
to be told what to do any more. He's standing up for his rights. He weeded out 
a lot of the dead wood," she said, referring to the older and less technically 
secure dancers who are gone from the company. "And it's now more financially 
feasible for the dancers to go do guest appearances with other countries than 
to leave the Bolshoi." 
</P>
<P>
The threat of defections and financial shortfalls still hovers over the 
Bolshoi, however; only recently the Bolshoi's Irek Mukhamedov defected to join 
England's Royal Ballet. But Semizorova agrees that perestroika has increased 
the possibilities for Soviet dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go abroad to study now," Semizorova said. "You can learn modern 
techniques. You can even start your own company. Some of the smaller ballet 
companies are self-supporting, but it's difficult to (fund them). I'm free to 
leave the Bolshoi and I'd like to have my own ballet company some day, but it 
isn't easy to walk away from the Bolshoi." 
</P>
<P>
Teranda Gedeminas, who will dance Hilarion in two of the upcoming performances 
of "Giselle," has the same emotional attachment to the Bolshoi. 
</P>
<P>
"We have interesting male roles in particular," he said. "And even if the 
living conditions are bad, it's still the Bolshoi -- and you're working with 
the best dancers in the country." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gedeminas, who was interviewed backstage at the Shrine Auditorium, was 
quick to add, "I'm a little skeptical of the situation (in the Soviet Union). 
It changes too often, and I think some people will still be leaving, because 
they have no confidence in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Gedeminas, more than any of his peers, perhaps, is looking forward to the visit 
to San Diego, since he has studied -- and performed -- with one of San Diego's 
leading ambassadors of modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
"When Betzi Roe was in Moscow, I worked with her, and danced in a concert with 
her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Grigorovich has the staunch support of most of his dancers and a 
proven ability to survive, he is concerned about the Bolshoi's future. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a rich country," he said. "We're not at all rich now."

A STRAIT PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I demand that The Times find someone to review country music who knows what 
he/she is doing. 
</P>
<P>
I attended the George Strait concert and I'm very disappointed with Robert 
Hilburn's Aug. 14 potshots at a singer just named country entertainer of the 
year! 
</P>
<P>
I am not a barefoot country bumpkin. I am a professional in Beverly Hills who 
grew up in L.A. There are a lot of us who appreciate the values, morals and 
smooth presentation of country music.

THE PROBLEMS OF THE LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am upset by the lack of publicity for the L.A. Festival, and particularly by 
director Peter Sellars' comments in an Aug. 4 article that the festival will 
"run by word of mouth" and that people who care will be there. 
</P>
<P>
I am a person who cares! Finally, I had to call and request a brochure, which 
(as I write this letter) I still haven't received. 
</P>
<P>
If the festival loses money due to lack of attendance, it will be difficult if 
not impossible to stage another event of such magnitude.

METAL GRANDMOTHER

<TEXT>
<P>
About Chuck Philips' Aug. 7 article, " 'My Heart Aches,' Mothers in Judas 
Priest Trial Tell of Their Five-Year Ordeal": How chilling that these women 
blame music for their own failure to "do it" (go to therapy themselves). 
</P>
<P>
I worked for five years with disturbed teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Christians with whom I worked were so upset by this music that as 
an open-minded, 60-year-old grandma, I got earphones to try to form my own 
opinion. Some of the lyrics were quite philosophical and poetic. The music to 
me offered a release -- a joyous celebration and outlet. I began to go to 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
This music offers an outlet for kids filled with hypocritical dogma from 
parents who are cruel, narrow and ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
We had 70 kids where I worked. Their parents never tried to change themselves; 
instead they blamed anything that they could to get off the hook themselves.

THE PROBLEMS OF THE LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Los Angeles Festival falls on its face, as a number of people now seem 
to fear ("Is the L.A. Festival Getting the Word Out?," Aug. 4), I'm sure there 
will be lots of hand-wringing about a failure to support non-Western cultural 
performances. Let me disabuse everyone of seeing that beastly notion as an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Both publicity and ticketing have been too little and too late. And a larger 
problem is the catalogue, which is partly unreadable and partly unusable. The 
designer decided it would be fun to lay dark type over dark backgrounds. (Good 
luck on page 15, kids.) 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to go. I tried to go. But at the end of an hour of eye- and 
mind-frazzling investigation. . . .

THE TEXAS TORNADOS BLOW INTO PALOMINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True to their name, the Texas Tornados filled the Palomino with a lot of hot 
air on Thursday. Also a stream of corny country, Mexican polkas, slow and fast 
R&amp;B, '60s pop hits, demented Lone Star psychedelia, hybrids of all of the 
above and, as ringmaster Doug Sahm might put it, good vibes. 
</P>
<P>
Sahm, his longtime cohort Augie Meyers, Chicano country singer Freddy Fender 
and the great conjunto accordionist Flaco Jimenez comprise the Tornados, a San 
Antonio semi-supergroup in the vein of country's Highwaymen and rock's 
Traveling Wilburys. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like a good way to get some idle careers back in gear, and it made 
much more sense in a sweaty nightclub than it does on their new album, where 
the music is often pedestrian and regressive. At the Palomino, the frolicsome 
foursome, supplemented by four other players, kept it loose and spirited. 
</P>
<P>
They know more about personality than pacing, and they haven't quite figured 
out whose solo comes next, but between Fender's couple of hits ("Wasted Days 
and Wasted Nights," "Before the Next Teardrop Falls"), Sahm's Sir Douglas 
Quintet chestnuts ("She's About a Mover," "Mendocino") and Jimenez's explosive 
workouts, plus an encore version of the legendary Roky Erickson's "You're Gonna 
Miss Me" and visits from Harry Dean Stanton and Los Lobos' Cesar Rosas, they 
kept the heat on. Pretty good for guys hovering around 50. 
</P>
<P>
The hot air? Frequent bursts of self-congratulation for playing "real" music, 
and regular breaks for record-biz chatter ("The single didn't chart, but the 
album's going crazy," Fender reported, as if heading a promotion meeting). Kind 
of blew the vibes. The Tornados and opening act Kelly Willis appear on Monday 
at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. RICHARD CROMELIN

X-CLAN RAPPERS PUT MESSAGE OVER GROOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They wore pounds of beads and leather fezzes; women shimmied behind them in 
African-cloth bikinis. Sidemen twirled red-black-and-green Afrikan flags, as if 
it were half-time at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
They led their audience in Zulu war chants, proselytized for a Brooklyn 
political-action group called Blackwatch, and asked the musical question, "How 
Black Is It?" (The answer came booming back, "Very, very black.") One of them 
mopped his brow halfway through the set, and said, "Isn't it great to be sweaty 
and black?" 
</P>
<P>
They were the hot New York political rap group X-Clan, making their West Coast 
debut at a packed Hollywood Live on Thursday. But the group's rappers Lumumba 
Professor X and Grand Verbalizer Funkin' Lesson Brother J could have been 
performing in an "In Living Color" parody of militant hip-hop if they weren't 
so serious about what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Between sermons they rapped to beats taken from George Clinton, rapped 
professionally and remarkably solemnly, never for a moment sacrificing the 
sanctity of their message for the sake of the groove. Topic A . . . and B and C 
and D . . . was the semiotics of Blackness, from its roots in African 
prehistory to lynchings that might have happened last week, smoothly put in 
context. You could admire their act, but it wasn't easy to like. X-Clan appears 
again at Hollywood Live tonight. JONATHAN GOLD

COMPUTAINMENT: 'LES MANLEY': ELVIS IT'S NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE deCOSTER and DAVID CROOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor guy. He's such a loser. His job is boring. His boss is nasty. His love 
life is non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
But opportunity knocks. Fame and fortune are just a contest away. Prove the 
King is still alive, and collect the $1-million prize. Can the lovely Stella be 
far behind? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to "Les Manley in Search for the King." Tacky but timely. 
</P>
<P>
Les works for a television station WILL in the ghetto of New York. In an effort 
to boost sagging revenues, Les' sleazoid boss decides to cash in on a national 
pastime. Is the King alive or dead? Of course there is no question -- the 
superstar can't possibly be found, and nobody could ever claim the money. 
</P>
<P>
But no one let's our hound dog Les in on the scheme, so he collects a few 
necessities and heads off on his quest. He goes to Las Vegas and a place that 
bears a striking resemblance to Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
(Those with suspicious minds should note that the striking but unlicensed 
similarities between the King and Elvis are obligingly disclaimed in the 
manual: " 'Les Manley in Search for the King' is a work of fiction. Any 
similarities of characters in the game to persons living or dead is either 
coincidental, or unintended." Return to sender.) 
</P>
<P>
The setup for this game is very easy. And, for newcomers to adventure-style 
computer games, the manual provides an especially clear explanation of how to 
play. It also sets up a good walk-through to get you started. Included are 
several nice features in the command word processor providing some handy 
communication shortcuts. But even experienced players are likely to run into 
problems moving Les across the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, so Les is now on the road. What's he doing out there? Since it is 
buried in a trivial piece of advertising included in the game package, it's 
probably OK to mention an essential secret: Les must "do a stint as a King 
impersonator." 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty in digging out that vital bit of information shows how the 
designers of the game have confused obscurity with intricacy. A good adventure 
game, like a good mystery, should lead its player/reader on a merry chase. Key 
word: lead. Even if clues lead to the wrong conclusions or destinations, throw 
up smoke screens or implicate the wrong person, they should at least be there. 
The "King" tends to leave out lots of clues, leaving you irritated and 
frustrated rather than intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
The "King's" publisher (Accolade), however, doesn't just leave you all shook 
up. The company provides at least three different sources for hints to help you 
help Les accomplish his goal. A clue book is available from software dealers, 
and Accolade has both a 900 number (users are charged by the minute) and an 
electronic bulletin board for players with a modem. We'd love to hear from 
someone who got Les and his diminutive good luck charm Helmut to Las Vegas 
without using one of the hint sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Manley in Search for the King" is published by Accolade of San Jose.

SEXY HBO TRILOGY SEDUCTIVELY LITERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home Box Office is having admirable success reviving the omnibus TV series, 
most notably with its popular horror anthology show "Trilogy of Terror." This 
weekend, the cable network presents a trilogy of terror of a distinctly 
different sort with the triple-headed premiere of "Women &amp; Men: Stories of 
Seduction," which in fact offers stories less about seduction than about 
subsequent romantic withdrawal, paranoia and betrayal. Now that's scary. 
</P>
<P>
HBO can count on a much tougher sell for "Women &amp; Men" (premiering Sunday 
night at 9), which -- notwithstanding the saucy subtitle -- veers mighty close 
to PBS territory by offering stately adaptations of time-honored short-story 
properties, albeit with bigger names in front of and behind the camera. It's 
worth the effort it might take to find and keep an audience: The episodes on 
view in the premiere are by turns wildly funny and quietly affecting, and at 
all times seductively literate. 
</P>
<P>
Wittiest and best of the three is "The Man in the Brooks Brothers Suit," with 
Frederic Raphael (the Oscar-winning screenwriter of "Darling") writing and 
directing Mary McCarthy's pathos-tinged story about a one-night stand on a 
railroad car between a haughty left-wing journalist and an initially boorish 
traveling salesman. 
</P>
<P>
Playing from sophisticated to girlish to churlish -- in direct proportion to 
the alcohol she's consumed -- a terrific Elizabeth McGovern reels off one 
zinger after another, the cynical barbs in her voice-over narration only 
slightly more stinging than those she aims at her conservative trainmate. 
("Stand by for a Fascist invasion," she intones before finally succumbing to 
his sexual overtures.) Her world-weary, drunken soliloquy about men is both 
hilarious and moving. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Bridges achieves an equally difficult task, sympathetically taking his 
middle-class Everyman from obnoxiousness to empathy and creating the kind of 
character you can believe the liberated McGovern might spend her days pining 
for. 
</P>
<P>
If only the middle episode, Dorothy Parker's "Dusk Before Fireworks," were cast 
as well. Elegantly directed by Ken Russell in his most subdued mode, the 
lighthearted Valerie Curtin teleplay has a wealthy, bathrobe-clad Lothario 
trying to placate an increasingly suspicious young flapper while fielding calls 
from other lady friends in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that Molly Ringwald is too anachronistic a presence to do justice to 
the period archness of her lines; the overwhelming effect of her fulsome youth 
may be intentional, given that Peter Weller, exuding wooden romantic 
insincerity, appears to be playing older than type in marked contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The subtlest and most serious tone is set with the third episode, director Tony 
Richardson's filming of one of Hemingway's more female-sympathetic stories, 
"Hills Like White Elephants." Writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne pad 
the dialogue a bit more than they might've -- as short as the teleplay is, 
Hemingway's story was even shorter. But it's remarkably faithful to its skimpy 
source, with a pair of American lovers in Spain bickering over the "it" that 
neither will refer to out loud: an impending abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting both meek compliance and a submerged sophistication that may never

who presses for the abortion but makes her feel the decision is hers.

TRIAL ORDERED IN BOY'S DEATH FROM ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers from Thousand Oaks were ordered Friday to stand trial on charges 
of involuntary manslaughter in the April death of a 14-year-old boy who died 
after they allegedly gave him part of a bottle of whiskey and bet him he could 
not chug it all without getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu Municipal Judge Lawrence J. Mira said the circumstances surrounding the 
death of Leland (Lee) Scovis -- the youngest of five teen-age boys chaperoned 
by the defendants on a camping trip to Leo Carrillo State Beach -- were tragic 
and egregious. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me a loaded gun is not unlike 80-proof liquor," Mira said. "The 
coroner indicated that the blood alcohol level was more than twice what he 
thought lethal." 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, 29, and Patrick Campbell, 23, will each stand trial on one 
count of involuntary manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor 
and four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The two are free 
on $5,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Another chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park was ordered to stand 
trial on charges of being an accessory to involuntary manslaughter and five 
counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Vernon, who is free on 
her own recognizance, is the sister of one of the boys and is engaged to David 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was invited on the April 14 camping trip by Vernon's brother, a friend 
of his, according to testimony during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the trip, David Campbell told a park ranger that he would 
take responsibility for the boys and then gave them alcohol, witnesses said. 
Patrick Campbell allegedly bet Leland that he could not drink the two to three 
inches of alcohol left in a half-gallon jug of whiskey without getting sick, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Leland drank the whiskey and collapsed shortly after that, witnesses said. He 
vomited and over the next one to two hours, Patrick Campbell cleared his airway 
to help him breathe. Patrick Campbell and the boys also tried to revive Leland 
by dragging him to the ocean's edge and letting cold water wash over him. 
Leland eventually stopped breathing and was taken by helicopter to Westlake 
Medical Center in Westlake Village. He died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Leland's blood alcohol level shortly after drinking the whiskey may have been 
as high as 0.52%, said Joseph Lawrence Cogan, forensic pathologist for the Los 
Angeles County medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Leland's family members, who have sat through hours of testimony in the 
four-day preliminary hearing, said they were happy with the ruling but said it 
did little to ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Very frankly, I'd forgive them if they saw him in trouble and took him to 
help," said Leland's mother, Jenny Scovis. "But to see a kid lie there and 
gurgle -- I wouldn't do that to a dog or cat or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Public Defender Carol A. Clem, who is representing 
David Campbell, said she had no comment on Mira's decision. 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Campbell's attorney, William J. Hardy, said he was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"It may very well have to go to trial to resolve the manslaughter case," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three will be arraigned in Santa Monica Superior Court on Aug. 31.

AIDS BOARD SEEKS TO CUT 21-WEEK WAIT FOR CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the 21-week waiting period that AIDS patients now face 
when seeking help at outpatient county medical facilities, the Los Angeles 
County Commission on AIDS on Friday recommended the immediate expenditure of 
$500,000 that had been set aside to staff a clinic next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"A 21-week waiting period is a huge crisis . . . it is unconscionable," said 
AIDS commission chairman Rand Schrader, a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge. 
"We can't keep our money in the bank and tell people we'll help them later." 
</P>
<P>
The money could help cut the 300-patient waiting list at County USC-Medical 
Center in half by as early as the fall, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Using the money now will cut into funding earmarked for operation of the 
outpatient AIDS clinic scheduled to open at County-USC Medical Center next 
April, Schrader said. He said the commission will deal with that problem when 
it comes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader said the commission's hope is that once the additional staffing is in 
place, the county Board of Supervisors will find it hard to cut back the level 
of service and will continue funding it. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the commission's recommendation, the county health department's 
AIDS Program Office agreed to earmark the $500,000 to reduce the long waiting 
period for initial appointments for patients with AIDS and the underlying human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
</P>
<P>
Program director Robert Frangenberg said his office will prepare an action plan 
for the commission within the next few weeks. Once the plan is approved by the 
commission, the health department will begin recruiting additional medical 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Frangenberg said these employees will be transferred to the outpatient clinic 
at USC-Medical Center once it is built. The new facility will handle an 
additional 1,000 patient visits per month. County-USC Medical Center now 
handles 2,500 monthly visits. 
</P>
<P>
Although the timing is hard to predict, Frangenberg said, he hopes to hire 
additional staff within the next two or three months and ultimately reduce the 
waiting list by about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the additional staffing will occur at County-USC Medical Center, 
which serves more than half of the county system's AIDS patients, Frangenberg 
added that his office will also look into the possibility of distributing some 
of the additional personnel at other county medical facilities serving 
outpatients with HIV and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS advocacy groups greeted the commission's action with little more than a 
shrug. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't make a dent in the problem," said Connie Norman of the militant AIDS 
Coalition to Unleash Power/Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA), which has staged several 
demonstrations to pressure supervisors for additional AIDS funding. 
</P>
<P>
"This little $500,000 is going to get sucked up in no time by a totally 
bankrupt system," Norman added. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader noted that the Board of Supervisors' recent appropriation of $3.5 
million in new AIDS funding fell far short of the $9 million requested by the 
commission, the AIDS Program Office and a coalition of community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Vandervelden, board chairman of the Shanti Project, which offers support 
services for AIDS patients, said that the $500,000 expenditure is "a stopgap 
measure" that "doesn't address the larger issue the county is facing with 
respect to access to (AIDS) care generally." 
</P>
<P>
"Even cutting the waiting time in half still leaves people waiting an 
unacceptable period of time," he added. "We still have a long way to go before 
people with HIV can receive treatment equal to that enjoyed by most people."

WATER, OIL PROBLEMS TAKE TOLL IN VENTURA; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE INDICATES THAT SOME FIRMS ARE CONSIDERING 
LEAVING BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ventura's water shortage is so serious that many businesses are considering 
leaving the city, a survey by the Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The organization released the results of a questionnaire mailed to its 1,700 
members and returned by 227. The respondents viewed the water situation with 
alarm and criticized the city's response to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura City Council is controlled by advocates of slow growth, and in 
response to the water shortage it has placed a moratorium on new taps. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Bennett, chairman of the chamber's water committee, said in a statement 
that the survey showed that "few businesses locally can plan to compete here in 
the long term" because of the water situation. "As we stare at Southern 
California's unfolding long-term drought scenario, businesses have to weigh the 
locally politicized mentality compared to everywhere else our business 
competition is." 
</P>
<P>
The survey said the vast majority of the respondents believe the council is 
performing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates on the City Council responded that the survey was 
manipulated for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I really wonder whether the chamber wants Ventura to fail," 
Councilman Gary Tuttle said. Unlike many business people who favor the 
importing of state water, Tuttle favors building a desalination plant as the 
long-term solution to the city's water problems. "When people work toward 
failure and preach failure, failure is more likely to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 31 people said they were seriously considering or knew 
businesses that were seriously considering relocating "because of unreliable 
ongoing water supply." 
</P>
<P>
Respondents indicating such sentiments included Leach Mounce, one of the most 
prestigious architectural firms in the city, and Ventura Spaghetti Co. 
Indicating similar sentiments were "six farmers, four builders, three plumbers 
and three electrical contractors." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the respondents -- 98% -- thought the water situation in the city 
was "serious" or worse, and half believed it was "extremely serious." 
</P>
<P>
Respondents were unhappy with the council's handling of the water situation and 
its overall performance. Two-thirds said the council's handling of the water 
crisis was "unsatisfactory" or worse, and one-fourth said the council was 
handling it "very badly." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also asked business owners to rate individual council members on a 
1-to-10 scale, 10 being the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman James Monahan, an ally of business interests and often a lone 
dissenter, ranked highest with 6.9. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Francis and Councilman John McWherter, who have sided with 
Monahan in calling for immediate state water importation, finished second and 
third, respectively, with 4.3 and 4.1. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Donald Villeneuve and Councilman Todd Collart, who are leaning 
toward state water importation but believe such a decision should be tied to 
strict growth control, finished fourth and fifth, respectively, with 3.9 and 
3.5. Council members Tuttle and Cathy Bean, who are the most closely aligned 
with slow-growth and environmental agendas in the city, finished at the bottom 
with 2.2 and 1.9 ratings, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said it is the chamber that is trying to manipulate the water 
crisis for political gain. The council and the organization have been sniping 
at each other over the issue for months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt by the chamber to bypass the democratic process by putting 
pressure on us to import state water before we study ways of controlling growth 
that the water would otherwise bring," Villeneuve said. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter said he was surprised by his low rating but believed the businesses 
were bluffing in saying they might leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always rated awfully high on chamber surveys," he said. "It just goes to 
show you what the overall image of the council can do to you. But I'm a member 
of this council and proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle, who owns a sporting goods store in downtown Ventura but is not a 
chamber member, said he was not surprised by his low rating. He did not seek 
the chamber's endorsement, he said, and has been faithful to his slow-growth 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
As for the prospect of businesses leaving town, he said, "If they think they 
can find greener pastures elsewhere, then so be it. But I know Ventura is still 
the best place in the county to do business and live in." 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, on the other hand, was predictably happy with the survey's results. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows the council is not dealing with the water situation as it should," he 
said. "I agree that there is a water emergency, but we're not out of water. A 
voluntary water conservation plan would work, but the moratorium was imposed to 
control growth in this city."

CARNIVAL RIDE OPERATORS CALL FALLING COINS A WELCOME BONUS 
</P>

It's the law of the carnival ride: What goes up must come down. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ventura County Fair, a virtual tempest of pocket change showers the 
ground around the 38 carnival attractions that tilt, whirl and shake 
fair-goers. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the few perks that come with working as a carnival ride operator. 
Part bouncer and part mechanic, operators are at the grounds from midmorning 
often until late at night and their pay is only slightly above minimum wage, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
The change -- the carnies call it the shakes -- that rains down from 
fair-goers' pockets, is part of the job, said Shawn Johnson, who operates the 
Round-Up, a giant centrifuge that rises to an 85-degree angle off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten pocketknives, watches. I've even gotten $100 bills," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the operators keep the "tips." Bobby Lee Jennings, 24, said he found 
$890 in a money clip on the Gunslinger ride he operates, but returned it to a 
man who came back to retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
The Sky Diver, one of the most popular rides at the fair, is a Ferris wheel 
with 16 cages that tosses riders as they dangle upside down at a height of 
nearly eight stories. But the Sky Diver should be called the Change Loser, 
operator Lance Holcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're wearing loose pants, and they've got $10 to $15 in their pockets, 
they lose it," Holcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
Operators often see wallets and stuffed animals fly out the windows of the wire 
cages that spin around the 90-foot-tall wheel, Holcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
Other rides are tamer. The Gunslinger is one of the attractions termed a "dud 
ride" by some teen-agers after more heart-pounding experiences. On Friday, it 
was abandoned until Karen Rowell, 32, let her three small children take a spin 
around the relatively tame ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them a little lecture coming over here about fair rides and how unsafe 
they are," Rowell said. "I figured this one's a safer one." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rowell's son Nathan, 3, looked tense and grasped the bar for several 
minutes as his two siblings roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
The rides have been inspected before being opened to the public, said Sharie 
Davis, who along with her husband runs Davis Enterprises, the firm running the 
carnival rides at this year's fair. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the popular Zipper ride was shut down for several hours while a 
mechanic checked the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
County fair officials expect to see carnival rides bring in about $325,500 this 
year in ticket sales, Assistant Fair Manager Art Amelio said. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage riders, ticket prices were lowered to 25 cents on Monday, Tuesday 
and Thursday between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. On Monday and Thursday, a $6 wrist 
ticket will allow riders to jump on any ride during a six-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
But today and next weekend, a ticket costs $2 to $5. 
</P>
<P>
When ridership is slow, operators tend to stretch a two-minute ride longer, 
they said, although the practice is discouraged by their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask people as a joke before they get on sometimes, 'What did you have for 
lunch?' " Holcomb said. "I don't keep people on longer, because they start 
throwing up." 
</P>
<P>
The length of a ride is not the only criterion for some demanding fair-goers. 
For 9-year-old Miguel Ortega of Oxnard the faster the attraction, the better. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's more fun than the rest of them," Miguel said, pointing to the Sky 
Diver. "It goes faster and I don't get sick. I could ride it again and again."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATION RESCUE TO HOLD PRAYER VIGIL AT 
CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, cheered by Catholic Archbishop Roger 
Mahony's comparison of them to formerly oppressed Eastern European Christians, 
announced plans Friday to protest at a Los Angeles women's clinic today. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid risking arrest, the protesters will not block entrances at the Women's 
Health Clinic on Spring Street, but will stand in prayer at an 8 a.m. vigil, 
then march to City Hall, officials of the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they will object to what they consider unjust jail sentences 
given to hundreds of protesters who attempted to block doors at clinics. 
</P>
<P>
A national organizer for Operation Rescue said the action is a tactical 
maneuver that has been used elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony spoke to about 200 Operation Rescue stalwarts at a conference at 
Catholic-run Loyola Marymount University. He urged patience with what he called 
the "ignorance" of abortion rights advocates.

<P>
A 46-year-old San Pedro man was shot to death in his bed early Friday morning 
by an unknown assailant, according to Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Lt. Larry Hinrichs said the victim, Mohammed Mahran, was found dead by 
his family about 7:10 a.m., moments after they awoke to gunfire in the home in 
the 22300 block of South Harvard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hinrichs said family members told police that they heard footsteps in the house 
just after the shooting but saw no intruder. They told police that the front 
door was open after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
No motive for the killing has been established, Hinrichs said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY ORDERS ALL CITY DEPARTMENTS TO SAVE 
FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday ordered all departments in the city of Los Angeles 
to begin saving gasoline and diesel fuel to offset an increase in prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Each department is expected to reduce their consumption and each employee is 
asked to join with us and shift to ride-sharing or public transit," Bradley 
told a meeting of his top managers. 
</P>
<P>
The city's cost of fuel oils has risen 30 cents per gallon, to $1.08, in the 
past year, and if a further increase of 20 cents occurs it could cost $3 
million during the next two months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Police Department, officers were told to save gas by turning off engines 
when writing tickets and doing other duties, Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city bought 13.1 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel for 
its vehicles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED FOR HUNTING DUCKS IN WILDLIFE 
REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Redding men on a midnight duck hunt in Marina del Rey were arrested early 
Friday for firing at birds in a protected wildlife area. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Burns Jackson, 26, and Richard Theodore Arellano, 20, both of Redding, 
face charges of firing a gun in a negligent manner, possessing loaded firearms 
in a vehicle and cruelty to animals, Sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
A resident called about 2 a.m. deputies, saying two men were shooting at ducks 
in a pond near the 4100 block of Admiralty Way, Ramirez said. The men drove 
away in a pickup truck, but were arrested eight blocks away. Deputies found two 
rifles and a shotgun in their truck and the suspects admitted they had been 
shooting at ducks, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
No dead ducks were found in the truck or at the pond, which is in a wetlands 
area set aside when the marina was built.

ABORTION FOES HEAR MAHONY, PLAN PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, cheered by Catholic Archbishop Roger 
Mahony's comparison of them to formerly oppressed Eastern European Christians, 
announced plans Friday to protest at a Los Angeles women's clinic today (8/18) 
without risking arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of blocking entrances at the Women's Health Clinic on Spring Street, 
protesters will stand in prayer at an 8 a.m. vigil, then march to City Hall for 
a rally, officials of the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they will object to what they consider unjust jail sentences 
given hundreds of protesters arrested for attempting to block doors at clinics 
in Los Angeles and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time the Southern California branch of Operation Rescue 
has planned a protest without attempting to block entrances, but a national 
organizer said the action is a tactical maneuver that has been used elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony spoke to about 200 Operation Rescue stalwarts at a conference at 
Catholic-run Loyola Marymount University. He said he had talked early this 
month to Catholic priests in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria who had been 
imprisoned for their beliefs before the communist governments collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard how they suffered, I couldn't help but think of the pro-life 
movement in this country ... how (people) were ridiculed for their beliefs and 
attacked," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles archbishop praised the group's emphasis on prayer. He also 
urged patience with what he called the "ignorance" of abortion rights 
advocates, saying their stance is based "so much on simplistic slogans." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony had cautiously backed Operation Rescue when it began protests in 
Southern California before Easter last year. But he denied the use of Catholic 
churches last August for the movement's rallies, contending that the church 
might lose its insurance coverage.

WHEN HISTORIC BUILDINGS MOVE, THE BUZZ CAN BE QUITE LOUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As members of the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society well know, it's not 
easy moving a historic building. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful crane must be rented to lift the structure off its foundation and 
onto an equally powerful truck, which carries the building oh so slowly to its 
new resting site. 
</P>
<P>
Then, sometimes, there are bees. 
</P>
<P>
Colonies of angry bees have been one of many obstacles -- from low-hanging 
power lines to narrow bridges -- the society has confronted over the years 
while moving historic houses, a school and even a train station to Heritage 
Junction Historical Park in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
Bees like to build their nests in the rotting wood of old, abandoned buildings 
-- the kind the society likes to save. Checking for apian interlopers is now 
standard procedure when the society prepares to move a new acquisition to the 
historical park. 
</P>
<P>
This week a ranch house dating from the 1870s was moved from behind Six Flags 
Magic Mountain in Valencia to the park eight miles away. The Newhall Ranch 
House, the seventh building at the park, was part of the famed Newhall Ranch 
purchased by land baron Henry Mayo Newhall in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
Society members say the 4,000-square-foot house has been used as a home, a 
storage shed and even a stable. The two-story structure was cut into two pieces 
and hauled to the park over two nights. 
</P>
<P>
Beekeepers said they could not remove some hives embedded in the walls and the 
insects were killed before the trip. "You hate to kill them," said Paul 
Kreutzer, society president. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little choice. Society members recalled the time they hoisted up 
a tiny chapel for its journey from Saugus in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire bottom of the chapel was one gigantic honeycomb," Kreutzer said. 
"Our mover got stung three or four times." 
</P>
<P>
Bees were the heroes, however, during the drama surrounding the society's 
effort to save the Mitchell Adobe, a tiny schoolhouse built by Col. Thomas 
Mitchell for children in Sulphur Springs in 1879. 
</P>
<P>
Society members formed a human chain to protect the building from a bulldozer 
that was going to clear the spot for a developer four years ago. Shortly after 
sheriff's deputies forced the protesters to disperse, the bulldozer rammed the 
building, letting loose a swarm of bees which, appropriately, made a beeline 
for the driver. 
</P>
<P>
"He backed off," Kreutzer recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The bee attack stalled the adobe razing long enough for the society to 
negotiate with the developer, who agreed to permit the preservationists to 
dismantle the schoolhouse. As Sandra Forbes, a society member, put it: "They 
were about to lose the battle when Mother Nature intervened." 
</P>
<P>
The adobe is now being restored in the heritage park. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the society tried three times to move the Edison house, a 1920s 
bungalow. Huge snowdrifts near Gorman blocked the moving company from reaching 
Santa Clarita for the first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The snow melted in time for the second effort, but the mover never showed up. 
He mistakenly drove to Palmdale. The third attempt proceeded without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time the society moved the 103-year-old Saugus Train Station 
in 1980. The station, which weighed 90 tons, had to be carted across railroad 
tracks and railroad officials assured the preservationists that a train would 
not disturb the move. 
</P>
<P>
But as the truck lumbered up to the tracks, spectators spotted a glowing light 
in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just starting for the tracks and boom, here comes a train," said Jerry 
Reynolds, a Santa Clarita Valley historian. "The truck was right up to the 
crossing gate when it started to drop. It came down inches in front of the 
truck." 
</P>
<P>
The movers got another shock, so to speak, when they discovered the station was 
too tall to pass beneath a 16,000-volt power line. But they were not concerned 
because the power to the line was to have been cut off before the journey. 
</P>
<P>
But an electrical worker, when asked if the line was truly dead, hollered down 
from a power pole: "Oh, no it's not!" His other comments are not printable, 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
After the power was cut, the line was lowered to the ground and the station 
trundled away. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the journey of the Newhall Ranch House was momentarily halted 
Tuesday morning when the San Joaquin Movers, a Bakersfield company, discovered 
that the house wouldn't pass through a narrow bridge crossing the south fork of 
the Santa Clara River, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
The company quickly jacked up the building so the sides could pass over the 
bridge's retaining walls. The ranch house arrived at the heritage park safely 
and now sits on wooden pilings while workers prepare a new foundation. 
</P>
<P>
As workers hammered together the wooden forms for the foundation on Friday, 
Forbes said the historical society has been told that a ghost has been known to 
inhabit the building. It remains to be seen, she said, whether the ghost made 
the trip.

PARAPSYCHOLOGIST STABBED TO DEATH IN NORTHRIDGE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northridge parapsychologist who wrote several popular books on phenomena 
ranging from near-death experiences to poltergeist activity was discovered 
slain in his home, and Los Angeles police said Friday they had few clues to 
help them find the killer. 
</P>
<P>
D. Scott Rogo, 40, was found stabbed to death after police were called to the 
house Thursday afternoon by a neighbor who became suspicious because he thought 
Rogo's back yard sprinkler had been running for two days. 
</P>
<P>
An officer found a side door to the house partially open, Police Lt. L.A. 
Durrer said, and discovered Rogo dead on the floor. The home had not been 
ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't determined if anything was taken," Durrer said. "We haven't figured 
out what the motive was." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said there was no evidence linking the slaying to Rogo's profession 
as a writer and investigator of psychic phenomena such telepathy, clairvoyance 
and extrasensory perception. The victim lived alone in the home in the 18100 
block of Schoenborn Street and primarily worked out of a home office, where he 
had a large library on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have any appearance of being related to his work," Detective 
Michael Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogo, a lifelong resident of the San Fernando Valley, was the author of 30 
books with titles such as "The Poltergeist Experience," "Beyond Reality," 
"Phone Call From the Dead" and "NAD: A Study of Unusual Other-World 
Experiences," published when he was a 19-year-old student at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Associates said Rogo was considered a serious investigator of strange phenomena 
and had also published articles in Parapsychology Review and the Journal of the 
Society for Psychical Research. He lectured on the topic at at John F. Kennedy 
University in Orinda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Bayless, former president of the Southern California Society for 
Psychical Research, said Rogo had an international reputation among 
investigators of paranormal phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
"He was top-rank," Bayless said. "This is a tremendous loss to the field." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 story on Southern California society, Rogo told The Times that he 
found "a lot more acceptance of paranormal phenomena out here than I do back 
East." 
</P>
<P>
"California is kind of a center of New Age thinking," Rogo said. "You are much 
more likely to be asked what your sign is at a cocktail party in Los Angeles 
than you are in Boston or New York." 
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother, Winifred Rogo of North Hollywood, said her son became 
interested in psychic phenomena after having what he believed was an 
"out-of-the-body experience." He wrote that the phenomenon occurred when "an 
element of an individual's consciousness appears to detach itself physically 
from the body and continues to function independently of it for a short time." 
</P>
<P>
"He investigated strange phenomena, but it wasn't dangerous," Winifred Rogo 
said. "I don't think it had anything to do with what has happened. I think it 
was a prowler, someone off the street."

SYLMAR HANG GLIDING ENTHUSIASTS HAVE PLAN FOR AERIAL CRIME-WATCH CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To join the Southland's newest crime watch group, you have to jump off a 
mountain, soar through the air and operate a camera thousands of feet above the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
That's no problem for "sky bums" from the Sylmar Hang Gliding Assn., who 
launched their anti-crime effort Friday in the skies above Angeles National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 200 aerial snitches say they frequently see illegal dumping, 
maverick skeet shooters and a lot of cars parked with no apparent purpose in 
the San Gabriel Mountains above Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see couches and stoves dumped up here because it's such a beautiful 
area," said Robert Laukka, 28, of Thousand Oaks, as he prepared to leap off 
wind-swept Kagel Mountain, his sleuthing camera strapped to the frame of his 
glider. 
</P>
<P>
Brush fires in the forest are also common, and they create an inconvenience for 
hang gliders because the National Park Service usually shuts down launch pads 
near the fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching out for arsonists will save us sky-bums a lot of grief," said Bob 
Lafay, 56, of Tujunga, who made his 1,217th hang-gliding flight from Kagel 
Mountain on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hang gliders decided to capitalize on their bird's-eye view in the hope 
that their presence will deter people from dumping stolen cars over the sides 
of cliffs and shooting guns illegally in the forest, said Rome Dodson, 
spokesman for the Sylmar group. Indeed, three men in a white pickup truck were 
observed Friday shooting at a tin car by the side of the 2 1/2-mile dirt road 
leading to the launch site. 
</P>
<P>
"If our watch stops one person from doing something wrong, it will be worth 
it," Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and law enforcement officers said the idea of such a group is, 
well, lofty. The snoops will swoop as close as 10 feet -- when wind conditions 
allow -- to photograph cars in isolated spots with lightweight, disposable 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The hang gliders will keep records of the vehicles they see and, in the event 
of a fire, will report the information to rangers or the police on hand-held 
radios or telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think it is a very good idea," said Jim Sanchez, chief of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department's air operations. "Whatever these folks can do, 
we appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three fires have burned so far this summer in the 690,000-acre Angeles 
National Forest, which stretches from the Sylmar area to San Bernardino, said 
Jim Stump, deputy fire management officer for the forest. Twenty were started 
by arsonists, none of whom were apprehended, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a bad year in terms of number of fires started, but we've been lucky 
only 1,735 acres have burned," Stump said. "Every little bit the hang gliders 
can do helps." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Chief Paul Blackburn, head of the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department's Prevention and Conservation Bureau, warned that like any crime 
watch group, the hang gliders need guidance from law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"They need direction," Blackburn said. "Some of those arsonists may be 
dangerous, so they shouldn't try to catch anyone themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Sylmar club said there is no chance of that. One of the reasons 
they started the watch group, they said, is to change the image of hang gliders 
as danger-loving and foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safer than most sports," said Dodson, as he prepared to race down a ramp 
and throw himself off the side of the mountain.

BASEBALL DIAMOND MAY BE SCALED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After eight years of bickering over the fate of a troublesome baseball diamond 
at Thousand Oaks' Fiore Field, nearby homeowner Austin Schoenfeld will have to 
wait a little longer until park officials decide how to stop wayward baseballs 
from flying into his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Little League, Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District 
officials have agreed to study a proposal to scale down Diamond 1 instead of 
removing it completely, as planned by the district. 
</P>
<P>
During its meeting Thursday night, the board asked Parks and Planning Division 
Administrator Fletcher Friedman to gather estimates on how much it would cost 
to modify the full-sized diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The board took the action after Russell Manthey, Conejo Valley Little League 
secretary, said the small diamond could be used for the Little League 
"Challenger" program for handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
Because the diamond would only be about 120 feet long, it would be too small 
for adults to use, virtually solving the wayward ball problem, he said. It is 
believed that adults are hitting most of the balls into Schoenfeld's yard. 
</P>
<P>
For lack of a better alternative, the park board voted earlier this year to 
spend about $45,000 to close Diamond 1. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials said they will meet with Schoenfeld to discuss the alternative. 
</P>

TEST PILOTS' MONUMENT DRAPED IN SECRECY; 
</P>
<P>
COMMEMORATION: GRANITE 'WALK OF HONOR' ON A LANCASTER STREET TO HONOR FIVE 
AVIATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The secrecy surrounding preparations for the "Aerospace Walk of Honor" in 
Lancaster, a sidewalk monument display that will honor Edwards Air Force Base 
test pilots, rivals the secrecy of the pilots' experimental flights. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, city officials will launch the project by unveiling five granite 
monuments along Lancaster Boulevard honoring five distinguished pilots. The 
tribute is modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame and celebrity "walks" 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
This week, officials showed off the official logo that will appear on aluminum 
medallions affixed to each monument. It depicts a test pilot staring off into a 
sky streaked with jet trails. 
</P>
<P>
But the names of the five pilots to be honored and the 10 other nominees remain 
a closely guarded secret. Officials have not disclosed the identities of the 
seven members of the panel that voted on the nominees; in fact, none of the 
members know the names of their colleagues on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Even the exact location of the Walk of Honor is unclear. Planners will only say 
that "pedestrian-size" monuments designed by a City Hall graphics artist will 
be placed along an unspecified three-block stretch of Lancaster Boulevard 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to keep it strictly confidential," said Assistant City Manager 
Dennis Davenport. "The intent is to maintain the integrity of the program. We 
want to avoid any pressure from peers or the public and prevent anyone from 
lobbying on behalf of nominees." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the nominees, whose service spans 48 years of flight testing at the 
base 20 miles north of Lancaster, are internationally known and include pilots 
who later became astronauts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the list includes Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) or Chuck Yeager, two of the 
most widely known test pilots, Davenport said: "People who have accomplishments 
like that are certainly being considered. These are the best of the best in a 
profession that is extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
But Lancaster spokeswoman Nancy Walker said fame is not the only qualification. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking at a history of achievement in the field, people who have 
been continuously outstanding, not just one thing that brought them media 
attention," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerospace Walk of Honor is believed to be the first such tribute in the 
nation, officials said. There is an aviation Hall of Fame in Ohio, officials 
said, but Lt. Col. Jan Dalby of Edwards Air Force Base said, "As far as we 
know, there is no other test-pilot walk of fame in the country." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members first proposed the idea in 1982 but then shelved it 
because of the need to revitalize the aging Lancaster Boulevard commercial 
strip. Like other old downtown areas, Lancaster Boulevard had deteriorated with 
the growth of outlying shopping malls. A performing arts center under 
construction and a historical museum are among recent redevelopment projects in 
the area that has been chosen for the monuments. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope the monuments will draw tourists to the area by promoting 
the Antelope Valley as an aerospace center and capitalizing on Edwards and

The selection panel consists of military, commercial and private aviators, an

POLICE DON'T MEAN SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the days when the sight of a police officer made you feel secure? He 
was a protector of your rights! 
</P>
<P>
Those days are apparently over in Ventura County -- at least from what I read 
in the L.A. Times. In horror, I read parallel stories of Ventura County women 
harassed by Ventura County "peace" officers for wanting to help injured 
children. The following Thursday (July 26) I read of a Ventura policeman who 
used a stun gun nine times on a helpless disabled man. 
</P>
<P>
Am I really reading this? A stranglehold used on a woman for protesting the 
anti-human acts of "law" men? A stun gun used on a helpless man for "causing" 
an accident? 
</P>
<P>
(And I am reading this within two weeks after returning from the Berlin Wall. 
What country am I in?). 
</P>
<P>
Yet the worst thing is to read that district attorneys -- our "public 
defenders" -- insist that these officers were only performing their duty! As a 
former professor in two university-run police academies (as well as a 
grandmother), I am outraged -- and embarrassed for those many fine law 
enforcement officers who still maintain a sense of personal dignity, restraint 
and dedication, yet must live and work in the paranoidal atmosphere that 
permeates the law enforcement offices in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is time we put warning signs up for those entering Ventura County: 
"Enter at your own risk: Lawmen dangerous to your health. First Amendment 
rights -- to say nothing of the Second, Third or Fourth -- do not apply here." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Thousand Oaks woman who retorted "offensively" to the 
sheriff's deputy, let me affirm: No self-respecting woman in America would have 
acted any differently than this "doctor's wife." 
</P>
<P>
Did I say "doctor's wife"? The sheriff's deputy who allegedly held a 
stranglehold on this woman said " . . . just because she's a doctor's wife 
doesn't mean she can . . . " etc. By focusing not by her own identity but only 
in relation to her husband -- and carrying out her act on this basis (if the 
L.A. Times story is correct), the officer showed a pathetic need of awareness 
training in what sexism is.

GOOD SURFING STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo, yahoo, excellent, great! 
</P>
<P>
The article about Mitch Thorson (Ventura County Life, Aug. 2) was the best 
surfing article to come out from any area newspaper ever! Perfect! The focus 
was on a transplanted local, local board-builder, (Malcolm's, the best we have 
in Ventura County), etc. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks very much for depicting surfers as intelligent human beings and not 
going for the stereotype "Jeff Spigoli"! 
</P>
<P>
You have endeared the Ventura County Edition of the Los Angeles Times to every 
surfer in Ventura County. Please more, more, more surfing of the Ventura County 
variety.

IF THIS ISN'T NEPOTISM, WHAT IS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of the "marriage in management" at the Child Support Division, the 
D.A.'s office has initiated a number of special arrangements specifically to 
accommodate the Troms. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to remove the child support ombudsman from the office and put her 
in a location completely separated from the child support function. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a newly created classification awaits her (in order to fit in with the 
organizational chart that has been renovated). 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary defines "nepotism" as undue favoritism and/or special treatment 
shown to a relative. 
</P>
<P>
Is this not special treatment for an individual based on her marriage? Mr. Trom 
is the managing attorney-D.A./Child Support, but there is now a child support 
employee who is no longer answerable to him. Is this not a change to his 
responsibilities required as a result of his marriage? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the "investigation" by the personnel department was conducted jointly 
with the D.A.'s office. As Mr. Bradbury has openly supported the waiver of the 
rules for the Troms, how can the study be considered objective? 
</P>
<P>
I prefer to consider the situation for what it is, a special treatment of 
certain employees due to their family relationship. In a word, nepotism.

JORDAN RANCH DEVELOPERS PUSH TOWARD SETTLEMENT ON MALIBU PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
HOPE PROPERTIES: BUILDER TAKES OVER THE OPTION ON ENTERTAINER'S CORRAL CANYON 
LAND, WHERE IT HOPES TO BUILD 50 HOUSES ON 339-ACRE TRACT AFTER SETTLING 
LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The developers of Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch property have taken over the option 
on his Corral Canyon tract in Malibu and will try to settle litigation over 
approval of a golf course and luxury housing there. 
</P>
<P>
The company, Potomac Investment Associates, which is attempting to develop the 
2,308-acre Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County, recently succeeded Sun 
Pacific Inc. as holder of the option on Hope's Corral Canyon land, Potomac Vice 
President Fred Maas said this week. Maas said Potomac will soon apply for state 
Coastal Commission approval to build 50 houses on part of the 339-acre Malibu 
property. 
</P>
<P>
To clear the way for the housing development, Potomac is hoping to settle three 
lawsuits challenging the approval in December by Los Angeles County supervisors 
of a golf course and residential project on the Corral Canyon property. The 
plaintiffs, including the state attorney general's office, the Sierra Club and 
the Natural Resources Defense Council, contend the approval violated the 
county's general plan and state environmental laws because the project would 
require massive grading of sensitive stream-side habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits were scheduled for trial on Aug. 22 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
But Potomac and the plaintiffs agreed on Thursday to delay the case pending 
settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
The various fates of Hope's mountain properties have been linked since April, 
when Hope offered part of Corral Canyon and a second tract as parkland if his 
troubled Jordan Ranch project in eastern Ventura County is allowed to go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the terms, a Corral Canyon settlement could affect Jordan Ranch by 
removing one incentive for approving a big golf course and housing project 
there. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Hope conditionally withdrew the Corral Canyon plan and turned over to 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy the 173 acres of the property on which 
the golf course was to be built. But the move and a related transfer to the 
conservancy of Hope's Runkle Ranch property in the Santa Susana Mountains had a 
big string attached. 
</P>
<P>
An access road to serve Jordan Ranch can be built only over National Park 
Service land, and Hope had offered 1,100 acres of Jordan Ranch to the Park 
Service in exchange for the 59-acre road site. 
</P>
<P>
The Corral Canyon and Runkle dedications were an effort to apply pressure by 
sweetening the deal. If the exchange did not go through, Hope retained the 
right to take back his Corral Canyon and Runkle Ranch properties. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Angel, attorney for the Sierra Club and Corral Canyon Homeowners Assn., 
plaintiffs in one of the Corral Canyon lawsuits, said his clients have no 
reason to settle the case without assurances that the 173 acres in Corral 
Canyon will remain parkland regardless of the outcome of the Jordan Ranch 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac officials said they are willing to discuss that condition. "We want to 
go ahead and engage in settlement discussions," said Bob Break, an attorney for 
Potomac. "Obviously, saving Corral Canyon and making that available for public 
use is the cornerstone of . . .the concern" of those who filed the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a PGA golf course and 750 residences on the Jordan Ranch has 
driven a wedge between environmental activists. Some have opposed the plan 
because of its impact on the scenic ranch and neighboring Park Service 
holdings, while others favor it because of the Jordan Ranch, Runkle Ranch and 
Corral Canyon lands that would come into public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is under review by officials in Ventura County, where a majority 
of county supervisors are believed to be in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
If the Corral Canyon land gained permanent park status through a settlement 
there, conservationists would have one less incentive to support the Jordan 
Ranch proposal and the land exchange that is the linchpin of the project. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement, however, would bring Potomac closer to building housing on the 
part of Corral Canyon not donated to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Maas, the Potomac vice president, said the firm hopes to get Coastal Commission 
approval for the housing by the end of this year. According to Maas, no further 
review by the county is needed, since supervisors in December approved the 
residences along with the golf course.

CAMP COUNSELOR, 19, PLEADS NO CONTEST TO MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old former camp counselor pleaded no contest Friday to charges that 
he molested three teen-agers at a Castaic camp for deaf children two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Luther Willis faced one count each of sodomy, sexual battery and child 
molestation and was being held in lieu of $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested Willis Aug. 10 at the Lion's of California/Nevada 
Wilderness Camp for Deaf Children held at 38001 Golden State Highway. Deputies 
were called to the camp after a camp official learned of the alleged 
molestations from a teen-ager there, Sgt. Joaquin Herran said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged incidents involved two 16-year-olds and a 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Willis, who is also deaf, had been a counselor there for two 
weeks. Two of his victims were deaf and attending the camp when the alleged 
molestations occurred, and another was visiting her brother. 
</P>
<P>
Had the case gone to trial, Willis would have faced nine years in state prison. 
Because of his early plea, he will probably receive one year in prison and five 
years of probation, Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Davis-Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors agreed to the arrangement because of Willis' age and to keep the 
victims from having to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"Sparing the victims the trauma of testifying, early admission of his guilt and 
his age all entered in the decision" to allow the plea, Davis-Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
Willis will be sentenced in September.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi troops began withdrawing from Iranian territory Friday, and the first 
1,000 Iranian prisoners of war were sent home. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, on schedule, delivered on his promise of peace 
after a decade of war and hostile truce, clearing the decks for a possible 
confrontation with other foes over his occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from Iran started at 5 a.m., with troops pulling out of a 
1,000-square-mile salient on the central front around the war-torn town of 
Mehran, captured in a final Iraqi offensive in the 1980-88 war. No figures were 
given on the number of troops involved Friday; the withdrawal is expected to be 
completed by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The release of Iranian POWs -- to an exultant welcome -- took place farther 
north on the border, at the town of Qasr-e Shirin on the main Baghdad-Tehran 
road. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move Wednesday, the Iraqi president gave Iran peace on Iran's 
terms, ending a conflict that began with his invasion of Iran's southwestern 
provinces a decade ago. Iraqi officials said Thursday that peace with Iran will 
free 30 Iraqi divisions, at least 300,000 men, for possible use in the crisis 
over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Western military spokesmen said the Iraqi armored troops in Kuwait -- estimates 
have ranged from 120,000 to 160,000 -- were still in defensive positions north 
of the frontier with Saudi Arabia. They said it is doubtful that Hussein will 
shift the entire force withdrawn from the Iranian border south to the new front 
with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi rulers fear that Iraq, with Kuwait absorbed, may 
want to repeat its Aug. 2 invasion by pushing into the kingdom to the south. 
</P>
<P>
A force of 66,000 Saudi regulars, supported by 25,000 Americans with more on 
the way, 5,000 Egyptians and 1,000 Moroccans, have "drawn a line in the sand" 
at the Kuwaiti border. Behind them are more than 160 American and British 
warplanes and a carrier-led Western naval force. 
</P>
<P>
As the strictures tightened on trade with Baghdad, two Iraqi vessels were 
intercepted Friday by U.S. Navy ships but were allowed to proceed when they 
were found to be empty, Reuters news service quoted the Pentagon as saying. 
There was no immediate reaction from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first known interception of Iraqi vessels in the gulf since the 
United States ordered its Navy to begin enforcing the U.N. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The guided missile cruiser England and the frigate Bradley challenged the Iraqi 
vessels, then let them proceed without boarding after a visual inspection, the 
Defense Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British governments had announced Thursday that they will use 
whatever force is necessary to choke off seaborne supplies for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"If (cargo ships) refuse to stop, then we will use the measures necessary to 
ensure that they comply with the sanctions," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams 
said in Washington, referring to the U.N. Security Council decision to embargo 
trade with Iraq because of its invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq promptly declared that any interception of ships at sea would be "flagrant 
piracy" and vowed that it would retaliate. U.S. and British officials insisted, 
however, that the noose will be tightened until Iraq withdraws from Kuwait and 
the oil-rich little sheikdom's rulers are allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
At the Suez Canal, Egyptian officials said they had permitted the passage of an 
Iraqi freighter carrying a cargo of food. They said the U.N. embargo did not 
prevent the vessel, the Zein al Qaws, from using the waterway to get from the 
Mediterranean to the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The freighter's destination was not disclosed, but a likely port is Aqaba, 
Jordan's port on an arm of the Red Sea, where a large convoy of trucks carrying 
food for Iraq moved out earlier this week. President Bush said Thursday after 
meeting in Maine with Jordan's King Hussein that the king had agreed to enforce 
the sanctions at Aqaba, but other U.S. officials expressed skepticism that the 
monarch will follow the sanctions to the letter. Jordan is heavily dependent on 
Iraq for oil imports and other trade. 
</P>
<P>
Four foreign tankers, including two Iraqi-flag ships, were still anchored off 
Muajjiz, Saudi Arabia, the terminus of an Iraqi oil pipeline. Saudi officials 
have refused to allow the tankers to tie up at the loading platform and on 
Friday reportedly turned down a request from one of the Iraqi ships, the Al 
Faw. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure, Iraq on Friday switched back to normal programming on 
Baghdad Radio after two weeks of patriotic music in the aftermath of the 
Kuwaiti invasion. No explanation was given, according to a news agency in 
Nicosia that monitors Iraqi broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
The monitors also reported a radio announcement that the curfew in Kuwait had 
been shortened. Baghdad said the new curfew will be from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. It 
had been going into effect at 7 p.m. Again, there was no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's call for an emergency meeting of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel, was facing resistance. Saudi Oil 
Minister Hisham Nazir, who asked for the meeting Thursday, said that OPEC 
should deal with oil shortages caused by the embargo on supplies from Iraq and 
occupied Kuwait. The ministers of Nigeria, Ecuador and Indonesia reportedly 
oppose the move. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rising prices, oil analysts said, a number of OPEC producers favor 
maintaining current production quotas until a six-month supply of oil on the 
world market is drained. 
</P>
<P>
On the Iran-Iraq border, Tehran Radio reported, the first Iranian POWs to 
return were weeping with joy and kissed Iranian soil that some had not touched 
for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of 10 years of patience and resistance," a Tehran Radio 
broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian news agency said a group of Iraqi prisoners had been taken to the 
border and would be handed over to Iraqi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein capitulated to Tehran's peace demands Wednesday, 
saying he was giving Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani "everything you 
wanted." He agreed to withdraw his troops from Iranian soil, exchange POWs and 
return to Iranian sovereignty the eastern half of the Shatt al Arab, the 
waterway that forms the frontier separating the two countries in the south. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials estimate that 60,000 Iraqis and 30,000 Iranians were held as 
POWs. In the two years of uneasy truce, only a few hundred injured or ill 
prisoners were repatriated. No formal peace treaty has been signed, but 
Hussein's concessions have presumably cleared the way for one. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, a reporter for Reuters, the British news agency, said he saw 100 
buses filled with Iranian POWs who had been held in the northern city of Mosul 
pass by, accompanied by Iraqi military police. They were dressed in yellow 
prison uniforms, he said, and some had full beards in the Iranian custom. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials said that all the returnees were interviewed to be certain 
they wanted to be repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, merchant Hamid Sajjdehchi told another Reuters reporter that his 
son, who he had thought was dead, was coming home. 
</P>
<P>
"My son has been a prisoner for seven years, six months and five days," the 
merchant said. "How the world changes. Once we mourned him, thinking he was 
dead. Now we are preparing a celebration for his return."

As Iranians celebrated the peace, a top official of one of Baghdad's staunchest 
foes, Syrian Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam, left Tehran after three days 
of talks with officials there. 
</P>
<P>
"In our meetings with Iranian officials, we stressed the need for withdrawal of 
Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the return to power of the legal government," 
Khaddam said. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has pledged to send a contingent of troops to the defense of Saudi 
Arabia.

U.S. READY TO CALL UP RESERVES; 
</P>

<P>
President Bush is preparing to act on a Pentagon request for permission to call 
up as many as 150,000 members of the National Guard and other reserve units to 
meet critical shortages of support troops that are developing as a result of 
the massive U.S. military deployment in the Persian Gulf, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials said no final decision has been made on exact numbers, 
but they left little doubt that a substantial mobilization of reserves is 
imminent -- with the first wave of call-up notices expected to go out as soon 
as early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Pentagon officials said, the armed forces cannot sustain the current 
buildup in Saudi Arabia -- now approaching 50,000 troops and growing rapidly -- 
without a heavy infusion of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has sought approval for mobilizing 80,000 reservists, while the Navy 
and Air Force are seeking approximately 35,000 each, sources said. Secretary of 
Defense Dick Cheney is supporting the services' requests and is understood to 
have discussed the need for a major call-up with Bush when the President made a 
speech at the Pentagon last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, the Pentagon ordered 16 civilian airlines to provide up to 
38 aircraft for an indefinite period to help shuttle troops and equipment to 
the Middle East in the first-ever deployment under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines have been asked to provide the planes and the crews needed to 
operate them within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Any large-scale mobilization of reserves -- with its disruptive impact on lives 
of individuals, families and communities -- is politically sensitive. As a 
result, Bush may elect to start with a relatively modest call-up, sources 
indicated, perhaps beginning with only a few thousand. 
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon officials said that far larger numbers are needed and that they 
expect to get a substantial proportion of what they are requesting. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything less than tens of thousands of reservists would be meaningless," said 
one Army official. Not all of those called up are expected to go to the Middle 
East; some are likely to be used at bases in the United States and other 
countries as replacements for troops used directly in the Persian Gulf buildup. 
</P>
<P>
The Army official said the Defense Department is prepared to begin sending out 
notices at the beginning of next week and is waiting only for a green light 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
A White House source said Friday night that final paperwork on a call-up had 
not yet reached the President, but he indicated that Bush was "almost certain" 
to take some action soon. 
</P>
<P>
Present-day U.S. military units are structured in such a way that they are 
almost totally dependent on reserves for such vital support services as 
transporting supplies, providing medical treatment and maintaining 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to 80% of combat service support troops -- everything from water and oil 
handlers and stevedores to engineers and signals corpsmen -- are in the 
reserves, attached to combat divisions," one Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he cited the Army's 24th Mechanized Division, which was sailing 
Friday for the Middle East with two of its three brigades. "The third brigade 
is in the Georgia National Guard. We plan on calling that brigade. It's organic 
to the 24th Division," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
A brigade consists of approximately 3,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in recent years, as the Pentagon has faced rising budget pressures, 
more and more support functions have been moved out of regular units and 
assigned to reserves. Now, the Pentagon may learn whether that strategy -- 
adopted primarily to save money -- can meet the test of a major crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering U.S. airlines to make the 38 planes available, the Pentagon said 
the move is necessary "in order to meet mounting airlift requirements for 
Operation Desert Shield" -- the official designation for the Middle East 
military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
The action marks the first time that the government has activated the Civil 
Reserve Air Fleet, a program under which the Pentagon pays to equip privately 
owned aircraft to handle military payloads in times of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department said the additional aircraft would be used "for several 
weeks" to supplement both military aircraft and existing support provided by 
civilian airlines through charter arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 commercial airlines participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, 
but only 16 are included in a "Stage 1" alert, the lowest of three possible 
levels of deployment. The government did not identify the 16 carriers or 
specify what kind of planes they would provide. 
</P>
<P>
"These aircraft would be used to augment the Military Airlift Command's routine 
overseas mission as well as operations in the Middle East," the Pentagon said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, which was developed in the 1950s, airlines equip specified 
planes to transport military troops and equipment. The government reimburses 
the carriers for the costs they incur, including additional fuel burned as a 
result of the planes' increased weight. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet is necessary 
because the deployment of U.S. forces to the Middle East has been bottlenecked 
to some extent by a shortage of cargo and troop transport planes. 
</P>
<P>
The order to the airlines was issued by Gen. H. T. Johnson, commander in chief 
of the U.S. Transportation Command.

PEARL BAILEY, ENTERTAINER FOR 57 YEARS, DIES AT 72

<P>
Pearl Bailey, a Southern preacher's daughter who became a top performer best 
known for her throaty rendition of "Hello Dolly," died Friday at Thomas 
Jefferson University Hospital. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital official refused to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
The singer, dancer, humorist and homespun philosopher -- Pearlie Mae to friends 
-- had suffered from a recurring heart condition since the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Singing does bring out the soreness," she once said. "But when I get on the 
floor, baby, you know nothing hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the singer underwent surgery to replace her arthritic left knee 
with a metal and plastic joint. 
</P>
<P>
She left Pennsylvania Hospital on July 30, intending to continue visiting two 
sisters for a week while undergoing physical therapy. She then planned to 
return home to Arizona with her husband, jazz drummer Louis Bellson. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, a performer for 57 years, is one of the few entertainers who could 
still be called a trouper in the classic sense. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Newport News, Va., Bailey moved with her family to Washington and then 
to Philadelphia, where she made her debut at age 15, winning an amateur contest 
by singing "Poor Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps best known for playing Dolly in the black version of the musical 
"Hello, Dolly!" in the late 1960s, she also enjoyed a long film career and 
appeared in "Carmen Jones," "Porgy and Bess" and other movies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, she received a special Tony award for her role in "Hello, Dolly!" 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey considered herself foremost a singer. 
</P>
<P>
Her standbys included "Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home," "St. Louis 
Blues," "Row, Row, Row," and "That's Good Enough for Me." 
</P>
<P>
She also has served as a delegate to the United Nations during the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey did her first show for U.S. servicemen in 1941 and had been a staple 
performer of the USO ever since. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote humorous and inspirational books, including "Hurry Up" and "America 
&amp; Spit." Her autobiography, "Between You and Me," appeared last year. 
</P>
<P>
Flipping a feather boa or swathed in chinchilla, ablaze with rhinestones and 
jewels, Bailey was famous onstage for her throwaway style of singing, a 
mumbling growl laced with husky patter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a comedienne," she once told an interviewer, "I call myself a 
humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people 
who call me an actress." 
</P>
<P>
She attributed her talent to God. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Pearl, what style do you have?' I say 'it's God, not style.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tall, folksy daughter of a preacher quit school for show business at 15. 
Her blossoming career made her a star of nightclubs, motion pictures, 
television and Broadway shows and earned her the friendship of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
At a Washington performance of "Hello, Dolly!" she was joined onstage by 
then-President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1970, President Richard M. Nixon named her America's "ambassador of 
love" to the world. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her death she was married to Bellson, her fifth husband, a white 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
The interracial marriage proved to be a happy one. The Bellsons adopted 
children and at one time lived on a ranch in Northridge in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The singer said in 1970 that perhaps she had failed to speak out enough about 
racial injustice, "but I've lived that way. I walk with love and hope it rubs 
off." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in humanity in that you don't bother to look at the color of a man's 
face. That's brotherhood," she added. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, she took a spin around the Persian Gulf to visit U.S. Navy personnel 
on ships there. 
</P>
<P>
That year she also told the World Health Organization that she wanted to 
dedicate her life to fighting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had her own television show in the early 1970s and in 1982 appeared in 
an NBC production of "Member of the Wedding."

Thunderstorms rumbled through the Plains and the South on Friday, flooding 
parts of Texas and triggering downpours in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Although the thunderstorms brought some relief from recent heat, customers of 
the Southern Co. set a record for electricity consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The company said customers in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi used 
28.3 million kilowatts of electricity Thursday to fight 90 degree-plus weather, 
topping the previous mark of 27.4 million kilowatts. 
</P>
<P>
Flash flood watches were posted in southeast New Mexico and southwest Texas as 
showers and thunderstorms drifted through the Southern Plains, the National 
Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain caused street flooding overnight in the Texas Panhandle town of 
Hart, and strong winds overturned trees and damaged roofs in Midland. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms rolled across southwest Minnesota, part of a storm system that 
extended into east-central Iowa. Related storms dropped heavy amounts of rain 
over parts of northwestern Iowa and northeastern Nebraska, the weather 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A slow-moving low-pressure trough stretching from North Carolina to central 
Alabama dotted parts of the South with thundershowers and dumped heavy rain 
overnight across parts of southeast Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
An Army convoy truck hauling Stinger missiles apparently for shipment to the 
Middle East overturned in a heavy thunderstorm near Savannah, Ga., dumping the 
weapons onto Interstate 95 and slightly injuring the driver. The missiles did 
not explode and the wreckage was cleared in about two hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A blanket of fog, meanwhile, covered much of the Northeast from Vermont to 
southern Maryland early Friday.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only weeks after South Africa lifted the lid on political expression in 
February, police in this small town arrested Valentine Senkhane during a 
protest march and tossed him into jail. 
</P>
<P>
Senkhane, a black lawyer and local African National Congress leader, was held 
in solitary confinement for three months. He was denied visits from his lawyer, 
his family and even his doctor. He had nothing to read and only jailers and 
police detectives for human contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I would look forward to interrogation, just for the company," 
Senkhane said. "But they never came." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it is sometimes with Section 29, one of the more notorious 
security laws on South Africa's statute books and, lately, a source of 
increasing friction between the ANC and the government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a much-touted peace accord last week and removal of the state of 
emergency in most of South Africa, there is still a strong web of security laws 
that give police broad powers to detain political activists indefinitely 
without filing charges. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 25 years, Section 29 of the Internal Security Act has empowered 
police to hold anyone in solitary confinement "for purposes of interrogation" 
until "all questions are satisfactorily answered." And no court in the land has 
the power to review or overrule such a detention. 
</P>
<P>
More than 24,000 South Africans, including some of the most famous names in 
black liberation lore, have been detained under Section 29, some for months. 
More than 50,000 additional activists have been detained under emergency 
decrees over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Of all those so held in the last three decades, less than a fourth were ever 
charged with a crime, and only 3% were convicted, according to human rights 
groups. Senkhane's detention ended three weeks ago, when he was charged with 
forming an illegal gathering and was released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
But police contend that Section 29 is an invaluable investigative tool because 
it allows them to prevent additional crimes by yanking suspected terrorists out 
of society while they build a case that will hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"Interrogating suspects takes time, and that's why we have Section 29 -- to 
save lives," police Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
But Section 29 has been loudly criticized by the ANC and other anti-apartheid 
organizations. They say police use the law to extract information by isolating 
and disorienting detainees. In the worst cases, they contend, police use it to 
torture confessions out of activists. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 people have died in detention, including two this year. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement reached last week, the ANC suspended its armed struggle, and 
the government, among other things, agreed to review its security legislation, 
including the Internal Security Act. But, within days, the ANC had accused the 
government of using "Section 29 and other repressive laws to disrupt our 
organizations and to harass our members." 
</P>
<P>
It specifically protested the detention of Mac Maharaj, a member of the ANC's 
national executive committee, who has been held since last month. Maharaj's 
associates say he was arrested in connection with a 3-year-old ANC plan to 
stage an armed insurrection in South Africa if negotiations failed. 
</P>
<P>
Maharaj is one of about 100 blacks and several dozen white right-wing militants 
who sit in Section 29 detention today. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing whites were once among the strongest supporters of extra police 
powers, but they have recently had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people are being held in solitary confinement, and they have no legal 
representation," Robert van Tonder, leader of the far-right Boer State Party, 
complained recently. "You read about these things happening in Russia, but you 
never used to see this here." 
</P>
<P>
That gives Maj. Gen. Stadler, the police spokesman, a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody reckoned Section 29 was just for black people," Stadler said. 
"Right-wing people always told us we must keep it because it's a good thing. 
Now they're all screaming that it's bad."

MEXICO CITY YIELDS MORE CLUES TO PAST; 
</P>
<P>
A PRE-SPANISH SKULL, TABLETS ARE DISCOVERED BY REPAIRMEN UNDER A DOWNTOWN 
MANSION.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a captured warrior in the Aztec Empire, the most honorable way to die was 
fighting. Tied to a giant stone, the prisoner would do battle against four 
gladiators at once. In death, he -- or she -- was decapitated, a sacrifice to 
the gods. 
</P>
<P>
This, anthropologists say, may have been the fate of the Indian soul whose 
skull was unearthed in downtown Mexico City last month five feet beneath a 
colonial mansion that was undergoing restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, diggers found what may be the key to the skull: six stone tablets 
depicting dismembered limbs, symbols of divine blood and acorns for the god 
Xipetotec, one of the many Aztec gods to whom sacrifices were made. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we have found something like this downtown," said 
anthropologist Elsa Hernandez, who is in charge of the urban site. "The cranium 
is deformed. That is a characteristic of someone of high social class. As 
babies, their heads were bound with pieces of wood in the front and back until 
the bones gave way. It was considered beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologists, who are just beginning to study the skull and tablets, are far 
from certain to which god the offering was made. But they consider the new find 
another clue to unraveling the mysteries of Mexico's extensive and often grisly 
pre-Spanish past. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish conquerors built Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital, 
Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Templo Mayor, or Great Temple pyramid, was discovered 
in 1978, a block from the Spanish-built National Palace and the Roman Catholic 
cathedral. The Templo Mayor was the principal religious site, surrounded by 
lesser pyramids dedicated to minor gods. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion at Argentina 12, where the skull and tablets were found, was built 
atop one of those. The temple was directly in front of the Templo Mayor and is 
believed to have been dedicated to either Coateocalli, the god of prisoners, or 
to Cihuacoatl, a serpent woman and goddess of land. The discovery may help 
anthropologists decide which one. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 18th Century, Spanish tax collector Jose Francisco de Fagoaga 
y Arozqueta bought the land and commissioned Valencian sculptor Manuel Tolsa to 
build his three-story mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Fagoaga's elegant home was completed in 1805, five years before Mexico's war of 
independence from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the 20th Century, the Mexican government bought the colonial 
building to house its growing bureaucracy, using it for one of its ministries. 
Since then, the mansion has been in continuous use by various government 
offices. In 1988, it was turned over to the National Council for Culture and 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1901, archeologists discovered the stairway to a pyramid beneath the 
mansion's central patio. Soon afterward, they unearthed a carved stone jaguar, 
called Cuauhxicalli, with an opening in its back for offerings to the Aztec 
gods. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City, sitting on a dry lake bed prone to earthquakes, shakes like a soft 
bed under a restless sleeper. Its colonial buildings teeter, sink and crack. In 
1985, while repairing the foundation of Argentina 12, workers discovered a 
stone eagle the size of a sheep. 
</P>
<P>
The arts council has continued restoring the building amid the desks and 
paperwork. When fixing a crack last month, workers found the skull and tablets 
in the corner of a storeroom. 
</P>
<P>
"These are pieces of the great mosaic that was the ceremonial center of 
Tenochtitlan," Hernandez said. "They are pre-Hispanic information." 
</P>
<P>
Such digging goes on throughout downtown Mexico City, despite hordes of street 
vendors, office workers, shoppers and tourists. One gets the impression that 
all of the central city is sitting atop a pre-Spanish treasure chest: The Sun 
Temple was discovered beneath the cathedral in 1976; the Education Ministry 
building is being excavated now.

By law, anthropologists may examine all downtown work sites and renovations of 
colonial buildings. The subsoil is under the guardianship of the National 
Institute of Anthropology and History. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes they arrive too late. Workers renovating the San Agustin Church 
on Uruguay Street shoveled up a graveyard of Spanish viceroys before 
anthropologists could get to them. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers don't like us anthropologists very much because we interrupt their 
schedule," Hernandez said. "But we have the right and obligation to go in. This 
is our history."

Rebel leader Charles Taylor suffered minor injuries in an auto accident, 
delaying his departure for peace talks with a rival rebel chief and an envoy of 
President Samuel K. Doe, a rebel official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Woewiyu, Taylor's spokesman and defense minister, said the accident 
occurred as the rebel chief prepared to leave Liberia for talks Monday in 
Banjul, Gambia, on how to resolve Liberia's eight-month civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was not serious, but Taylor returned to the Firestone rubber 
plantation clinic for treatment and to arrange new transport, Woewiyu said from 
Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The plantation is 35 miles southeast of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Woewiyu did not say when Taylor would leave Liberia for Banjul. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was announced Thursday by Gambian government sources. Word of the 
talks could lead to further delays in the deployment of a six-nation West 
African force charged with halting the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Marines Friday flew about 360 Indian refugees 
from Liberia to Freetown, capital of neighboring Sierra Leone. A U.S. Embassy 
spokesman in Freetown told reporters that the Marines had evacuated about 700 
people in the past week, mostly foreigners, and would continue evacuating the 
capital this weekend.

READY FOR PEACE PACT, EL SALVADOR SAYS

The Salvadoran government is ready to bring to a swift halt the decade-old war 
with leftist rebels, the chief government negotiator in peace talks said Friday 
in opening a fourth round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of President (Alfredo) Cristiani is interested in conciliation 
in matters regarding the reorganization of the armed forces that would allow a 
pact to end armed hostilities," said Oscar Santamaria, leader of the government 
delegation and Salvadoran justice minister. 
</P>
<P>
Santamaria arrived in San Antonio de Belen, a tourist resort 12 miles northwest 
of San Jose, on Thursday to begin a new six-day round of talks with rebels of 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, known as the FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
The major issue in the United Nations-mediated talks is reform and reductions 
in the Salvadoran armed forces, a subject the two sides failed to agree on 
during the second round of talks in Mexico and the third round last month at 
San Antonio de Belen. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said it was ready to talk about handing over control of 
two of El Salvador's three highly militarized police forces to civilian 
ministries and disband the rural civil defense forces, but rebel sources said 
the concessions do not go far enough to prompt the FMLN to re-enter El 
Salvador's political arena.

A group of nine foreigners, including three Americans, bolted across the 
Kuwaiti desert to this border town Friday in an effort to avoid an Iraqi order 
to gather at a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"No one responded to the Iraqi call, as far as I know, but everyone is making a 
rush to get out of Kuwait," said Stephanie McGehee, 37, a part-time reporter 
and photographer for the Associated Press who was in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Contact with McGehee, from the San Diego county town of Leucadia, was lost two 
days after the Aug. 2 invasion as the Iraqis gradually cut off all telephone 
and telex lines. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iraqi military authorities ordered Britons and Americans to 
assemble at Kuwait hotels but then failed to turn up to meet them. There are 
about 4,000 Britons and 2,500 Americans in Kuwait. McGehee said she escaped 
along with two other Americans, a Briton, a Canadian and four Indians. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had heard that only two Britons showed up at the Regency Palace 
hotel in response to the Iraqi order. They were told: "We have no room for you, 
stay in the ballroom." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it was all only an Iraqi show, but everyone is trying to get out," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
McGehee said she and the others all dressed as Kuwaitis. She spoke Arabic, so 
she sat next to the driver. She said she carried the identity card of a 
Lebanese friend. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we left the paved road, we ran into Iraqis, and they said we had to 
go back," she said. "We moved away and then took another turn through the 
desert sands and made a dash for it," she said. "It was very, very 
terrifying.".

KUWAITI RAIDS FUEL IRAQ CRACKDOWN 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Ross of The Times' Washington Bureau is a member of the Pentagon press 
pool currently in Saudi Arabia. This report was written for the pool, whose 
members are not allowed to disclose their exact location. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait have closed mosques and sealed the border 
with Saudi Arabia in response to continuing hit-and-run attacks by Kuwaiti 
resistance cells, according to refugees arriving here. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance is still relatively small and uncoordinated, but "it is growing 
as we become more organized," said a Kuwaiti shopkeeper, who fought with the 
underground for nearly two weeks before the location of his cell was discovered 
and surrounded by Iraqi tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The shopkeeper, an army reservist who asked to be identified only as Nasser, 
his first name, said resistance members were holding more than 150 Iraqi 
soldiers prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
They were captured, he said, in night-time raids on Iraqi patrols in 
residential areas of the Kuwaiti capital. 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee, a high school soccer coach who fled on Thursday, said Kuwaitis 
knew that the resistance was continuing because scattered shooting could still 
be heard throughout the city at night. 
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Anazi, 37, said the Iraqis had imposed a curfew Wednesday because 
"young Kuwaitis are shooting at their soldiers in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
No formal curfew had been in effect before Wednesday, Anazi said, adding that 
it was but one of several security measures the Iraqis have taken this week to 
deal with the still small but apparently growing underground resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"They also closed the mosques whose ulemas (prayer leaders) were denouncing the 
Iraqis and speaking out against the invasion," Anazi said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the young people," he added. "They are the ones who are taking up arms 
and fighting . . . but only at night." 
</P>
<P>
Other newly arrived refugees also confirmed reports by Saudi sources that the 
Iraqis have closed the border to Kuwaitis trying to enter Saudi Arabia. Until a 
few days ago, the Iraqis were barring foreigners from leaving but were allowing 
-- even encouraging -- Kuwaitis to go. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials said more than 100,000 Kuwaitis were now in the kingdom but 
that the flow of refugees abruptly slowed to a trickle a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Anazi and another refugee who arrived in Saudi Arabia after the border was 
closed said they escaped by crossing the desert at a remote spot far from the 
frontier post where they had been turned back by Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees, interviewed at a school, a hotel and other locations where they 
have been given temporary shelter by the Saudi government, gave similar 
accounts of the Aug. 2 invasion, which appeared to have taken their tiny 
country and its unprepared defense forces by complete surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought they would do this to us," said Nasser Asmi, a 32-year-old 
worker with the Kuwait Oil Co. "We thought, 'How could they do this to us, a 
neighbor and fellow Muslim country?' But Saddam Hussein is a bad man. We never 
had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Stunned into submission by the overwhelming size of the invasion force, the 
Kuwaitis offered only scattered resistance for the first day. 
</P>
<P>
"We woke up in the morning and found Iraqis everywhere," said Asmi. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Iraqi troops had been massing on their borders, Kuwaiti leaders 
apparently chose to believe Hussein's assurances, delivered to other Arab 
governments, that he would not invade Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Kuwaiti National Guard was not on alert, and its main garrison 
in the capital was nearly deserted on the morning of the invasion because most 
of its men had been given the Thursday-Friday (Friday is the Muslim Sabbath) 
weekend off, according to one of the defenders who escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, there are about 2,000 soldiers stationed at the garrison, but there 
were only about 120 on duty on the morning of the invasion," when the Iraqis 
surrounded the garrison with tanks, said Cpl. Melfi Asmi, 34. 
</P>
<P>
"We resisted all day, from 7 in the morning until 7 at night, but they were 
firing at us from all sides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asmi, who is Nasser Asmi's cousin, said about half the defenders were killed or 
wounded before the rest chose to flee. "There was no officer there to make 
decisions. The highest-ranking soldier was a sergeant. We did the best we 
could, but at last we realized we would all be killed if we stayed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser's garrison apparently held out longer than did the defenders at other 
installations in Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
In the first eyewitness account of the storming of the emir's palace, Mansour 
Mohanni, 32, said that it fell to a force of "about 70 Iraqi commandos who came 
over the back wall" at about 12:30 p.m., more than 10 hours after the initial 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"They came over the wall firing rockets and machine guns," said Mohanni, a 
clerk at the palace. 
</P>
<P>
He said the palace guards killed 15 of the Iraqis before being overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Mohanni, who escaped after the Iraqis entered the palace to hunt down the 
remaining guards, said that the emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, 
was not there at the time of the attack. He said he knew how the emir had 
escaped but would not divulge it. 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaitis who were interviewed all said that the invasion appeared to have 
been well-planned. "They bombed the runways so our jet fighters could not take 
off, and they cut the communications right away," leaving National Guard bases 
throughout the country isolated from one another, Cpl. Asmi said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis had very good intelligence. They knew where everything was. They 
even knew where the foreigners lived," added Nasser, the shopkeeper and army 
reservist. 
</P>
<P>
While the thoroughness of their intelligence suggests that the Iraqis may have 
been planning the invasion for some time, every Kuwaiti interviewed over the 
past several days -- from senior government officials to ordinary citizens -- 
professed shock and profound disbelief at what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we were so complacent, so foolish," another refugee, who 
asked not to be identified, said bitterly. "As Muslims, I guess we never 
thought our brothers could do such a thing to us." 
</P>
<P>
As the initial shock began to wear off, some Kuwaitis using arms taken from 
police stations -- and from the Iraqi soldiers they later killed -- went 
underground and began ambushing Iraqi patrols at night, Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not attack large groups of Iraqis, but if we saw two or three 
together, we would shoot them," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In the first week after the invasion, the troops patrolling the capital were 
"relaxed" and undisciplined, Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who carried out the initial attack -- Iraq's elite Republican 
Guards -- were withdrawn soon after the invasion and replaced by ordinary 
troops, many of whom had been told by their commanders that they were going to 
Kuwait to safeguard it from an American invasion, Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not expect us to attack them, so they were easy targets. These were 
also the soldiers who did the terrible things, the ones who raped our women," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They looted everything," another Kuwaiti said. "They made motorists stop in 
the street and give them their cars. They even stopped people on the street to 
take the watches off their wrists." 
</P>
<P>
Another witness said he saw some Iraqi soldiers shoot the plate-glass out of 
the window of a Mercedes-Benz dealership and drive off with the cars. "They 
took all the new American and European cars back to Baghdad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the behavior of the occupying force became worse, the resistance grew 
bolder, Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
He asked that his group's method of operations and the area in which it fought 
not be disclosed in detail because his cell was still believed to be active. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that, on the third day following the invasion, he and his 
friends chased two Iraqi soldiers into a restaurant, where they shot one and 
captured the other. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to hide in a big refrigerator in the back of the restaurant. One 
resisted and we killed him. The other one surrendered," Nasser said, adding 
that the resistance was holding "about 150 Iraqis as prisoners" by the time he 
left Kuwait last week. 
</P>
<P>
Using gasoline bombs made from bottles with dates pressed into the necks to 
hold the wicks in place, the group also disabled an Iraqi tank one night. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis would stand outside their tanks. We would sneak up and shoot the 
men outside the tanks, then open the hatch and drop the bomb inside," Nasser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that a number of tanks were disabled in this manner. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance is still largely uncoordinated, "but we are getting more 
organized and better disciplined every day," Nasser said.

<P>
When James Zogby called fellow Arab-Americans across the country to arrange an 
emergency meeting today on the Middle East crisis, he realized how difficult it 
will be to fashion a unified response: One Arab community leader in Ohio had to 
back out because he had just been called up for active duty with the Naval 
Reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an American doing his duty, so it's not difficult for him," said Zogby, 
executive director of the Washington-based Arab-American Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, the incident underscores the diversity within the 
Arab-American community and the problems it faces in attempting to arrive at a 
consensus on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not one group with one voice," Zogby said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait among the 2.5 million 
Americans of Arabic descent has been just as troubled and varied as the 
response within the Middle East itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community reaction is certainly not uniform," said Khalil Jahshan, 
associate executive director of the National Assn. of Arab Americans in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many Arabs here are increasingly concerned that a prolonged 
crisis will lead to discrimination against Arab-Americans -- even though many 
are just as strongly opposed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been scattered reports of obscene phone calls placed to the 
offices of Arab organizations since the invasion, most Arab-American leaders 
report little hard evidence of widespread public resentment toward them. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been very few incidents of harassment so far, but if this crisis 
escalates, it could get bad," said Michael Sarafa, an Iraqi-American community 
activist in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"We get blamed for the problems of that part of the world," said Salam 
al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles. 
"That puts us in an uncomfortable position." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the Arab-American attitudinal split more evident than among the 
250,000 Iraqi-Americans. While some support President Saddam Hussein's view 
that Iraq has historic claims on Kuwait, others endorse the deployment of U.S. 
troops to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is just a conflict between Iraq and Kuwait, and it should have 
been resolved by the Arabs themselves without American troops," argued Salim 
Mansour, a Virginia physician and president of the American-Iraqi Foundation. 
The group was just founded in July and was in the midst of its first membership 
drive when the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we've got an American armada, with Stealth (fighters) and everything, 
going against a tiny country," complained Mansour. 
</P>
<P>
Hatem Shaaban, a professor at the Arabic and Islamic University in Los Angeles, 
said many Arab-Americans believe that what "Hussein did was of necessity, 
especially since Kuwait was once part of Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, Arab-American leaders have publicly condemned 
Iraq's invasion and supported the imposition of international sanctions against 
Hussein's regime. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs here are far more divided, though, over the deployment of U.S. troops to 
Saudi Arabia. Many warn that Arab resentment over American support for Israel 
will spill over into anger and opposition to U.S. involvement in the Gulf 
region. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that many Arab-Americans see a double standard in American 
foreign policy, with swift action against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait contrasting 
sharply in their minds with U.S. acquiescence to Israel's occupation of the 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many community leaders say Iraqi President Hussein's peace proposal, 
which linked an Iraqi pull-out from Kuwait to an Israeli withdrawal from its 
occupied territories, has found a receptive audience among Arabs here. The 
proposal was rejected by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam has no moral authority to raise the issue of a Palestinian homeland, 
but if we don't join that battle, we undermine our credibility," said Zogby. 
</P>
<P>
The demographics of the Arab community in the United States clearly influence 
its attitudes. Fewer than 1% of Arab-Americans are from the rich Persian Gulf 
states. The vast majority are natives of the poorest Arab regions. As a result, 
there is relatively little sympathy for the Saudis and Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Arabs here are either Lebanese, Syrian or Palestinian, and they 
identify more closely with Iraq's relative austerity than with Kuwait's 
opulence. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a resentment in the Middle East among the have-nots towards the 
haves, and that resentment has spilled over into the Arab-American community," 
said Jahshan of the National Assn. of Arab Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts of people like Zogby, it has been impossible to develop an 
Arab-American consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has become the first major Arab 
group to publicly oppose Bush Administration military policies in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that 90% of Arabs in this country are condemning Iraq's move into 
Kuwait, but 90% are also opposed to the unilateral deployment of American 
troops," said Abdeen Jabara, president of the anti-discrimination group. 
"President Bush's decision is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But other Arab organizations have reluctantly supported an American military 
presence in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the defense of Saudi Arabia," said Zogby. "For us, it is a matter 
of credibility. We have based our arguments against Israel's occupation on the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, and so we must now be 
consistent."

White House officials have adopted a bleak appraisal of what lies ahead in the 
16-day-old confrontation with Iraq, despite remarkable international support 
for U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf and the successful deployment of about 
50,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Most immediately, senior officials fear that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
will "lash out" in a surprise military strike as the economic noose tightens 
and the U.S. arms buildup, already the speediest major U.S. military 
mobilization since World War II, gains strength by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
Even if such an attack is avoided, the Administration foresees a long, 
politically draining conflict -- with no quick and easy way to bring the troops 
home. Such a war of economic and diplomatic attrition -- while less dangerous 
than armed combat -- would nonetheless impose heavy burdens on the United 
States even if it slowly tipped the balance in the Administration's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, despite its success in lining up international support for the economic 
and military embargo the White House hopes will eventually break Hussein's grip 
on Kuwait -- and despite the successful deployment of military manpower, 
materiel and air cover in Saudi Arabia considered sufficient to blunt an Iraqi 
invasion -- the view of the situation within the Administration as the crisis 
enters its third week is decidedly grim. 
</P>
<P>
The new concern about an Iraqi assault, Administration officials say, is based 
in part on the fact that Saddam Hussein is increasing his military buildup 
along the Kuwaiti border with Saudi Arabia -- to 160,000 troops, according to 
some estimates, far more than necessary to defend the occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
The bleakness of prospects for an early solution to the crisis is increased, 
Administration officials acknowledge, by their determination not even to 
consider negotiations with the Iraqi leader until he withdraws his troops from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of the White House, such a withdrawal might open the door to 
discussion of Iraqi grievances over the price of oil, its disputed borders with 
Kuwait and similar issues. 
</P>
<P>
But officials repeatedly echo Bush's view that talking with Iraq at this point 
would be the equivalent of negotiating with Hitler after German troops took 
over Czechoslovakia in 1938 in a prelude to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Administration sees little immediate chance that Hussein will 
pull back -- despite his reputation for suddenly reversing positions -- because 
doing so could engender such opposition among Iraqi military leaders that it 
would threaten his grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, one scenario being looked at by the Administration has the military 
build-up continuing -- in an unrelenting effort to deter an Iraqi move against 
Saudi Arabia from its reinforced positions in Kuwait -- and the undeclared 
blockade at sea putting ever-increasing pressure on Iraq by cutting off crucial 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
It is this pressure, rather than military operations, the Administration says, 
that will lead to the "liberation" of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has taken heart from the support shown throughout the Arab 
world for its position -- support, it is felt, that stems from a direct and 
personal sense of affront felt by such key Arab leaders as President Hosni 
Mubarak of Egypt and others after what they view as a betrayal by Saddam 
Hussein when he invaded Kuwait despite personal pledges to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials are also buoyed by the fact that, while concern continues to 
exist over how tightly Jordan will enforce the U.N.-mandated embargo, as of now 
the flow of goods moving to Iraq through the Jordanian port of Aqaba has slowed 
to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
In the Administration view, however, it is anybody's guess as to how long it 
will take before such pressure produces movement by Iraq, with the most 
optimistic estimates weighing in at less than two weeks -- a decidedly upbeat 
assessment that is not shared by many -- to others who predict there can be no 
break until October at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraq is said to depend on imports for 70% to 75% of its food supply, it 
grows some of its own fruit and produce, and some experts say it has stockpiles 
of grain and other foods to last three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
While officials don't believe that the embargo, no matter how successful, is 
likely to place Iraqis in danger of starvation, it is hoped within the 
Administration that it will produce fairly grim conditions quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But given Hussein's history -- much cited by Administration officials -- of 
using poison gas against his own citizenry, and his willingness to prosecute 
the war with Iran over eight years at the cost of untold numbers of civilians 
as well as soldiers, there is little expectation within the Administration that 
the Iraqi president will be easily swayed by the suffering of his people or 
ready to retreat any time soon.

INVASION IS END OF ERA FOR 'GULFIES' ; 
</P>
<P>
GULF STATES: THE LESSON OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOR THE FIVE NATIONS IS THAT 
THEIR WEALTH BROUGHT NEITHER POWER NOR SECURITY.

<P>
For 30 years, the Arabs of the Persian Gulf lived a gold-plated fairy tale, 
awash with money that transformed their backward little kingdoms into a 
razzle-dazzle of desert opulence. 
</P>
<P>
Other Arabs called them "Gulfies," disdainful of their windfall wealth and 
recent Bedouin heritage. But the 4.2 million people of the gulf paid the 
critics no heed. For they, along with the Saudis of the Arabian Peninsula, were 
the real Arabs -- descendants of the tribes and clans that brought Islam to the 
world -- and together they formed the richest collection of neighbors in the 
world. Vulnerable and isolated -- over the centuries, parts of the Persian Gulf 
have been ruled by the Portuguese, Persians, Turks and British -- the region's 
five city-states saw only two potential obstacles to their pell-mell rush into 
the 21st Century: a collapse in oil prices or an Iranian-inspired Shiite Muslim 
revolution against the royal families, who ran their countries like family 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
That the fairy tale would end with the invasion of Kuwait by ally Iraq was 
never even a subject of whispered speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The painful lesson of the past two weeks for the California-sized cluster of 
gulf states is that their awesome wealth brought neither power nor security. 
They had bought off enemies and courted friends with lavish generosity -- more 
than $600 million a year to subsidize the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
some $30 billion to bankroll Iraq in its war against Iran -- and in the end, 
the Iraqis had simply walked in and taken what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In grabbing Kuwait, the largest, wealthiest and most literate of the gulf 
states, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in effect made himself the ruler of the 
Persian Gulf. Among the prizes at stake is Kuwait's Fund for Future 
Generations, a kitty of more than $50 billion that Kuwait invested in the West 
to prepare for the eventual depletion of its oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever future now awaits the gulf states, the occupation of Kuwait ends a 
chapter of Middle East history that in its own way was no less dramatic than 
the building of the Panama Canal or the settlement of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
Although they remained the poor rich -- people with money but not skills -- the 
gulf Arabs had traveled farther and faster than any society the world had 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 60 years ago, the Persian Gulf sheikdoms were nothing more than 
medieval frontiers. Bahrain had no paved roads, electricity, flush toilets or 
radios. Doha, the capital of Qatar, was a fishing village with a literacy rate 
of zero. The emir of Abu Dhabi lived in a mud palace. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1970, the year after Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, the 
wooden gates to Muscat, Oman's capital, swung shut each evening at dusk. Those 
walking the streets had to carry a lantern at arm's length and continually 
announce themselves to avoid being shot as strangers. The country had three 
miles of paved road and 12 telephones. 
</P>
<P>
The first sheikdom to strike oil was Bahrain, in 1932. "We didn't think it was 
any big event at the time," a millionaire Bahraini merchant and former pearl 
diver, Mohammed Khajah, recalled some time ago. "Who needed oil? We didn't even 
have any cars on Bahrain then. We'd have been more excited if Socal (Standard 
of California) had struck water." 
</P>
<P>
But the wild escalation of oil prices in the 1970s -- from $3 a barrel in 1973 
to $39 on the spot market six years later -- turned the gulf topsy-turvy. 
Modern cities of marble and glass sprung out of fishing villages. A huge army 
of foreign workers was imported from Egypt, Pakistan and the Philippines to 
staff everything from hospitals to construction crews. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gulf's underground riches spawned the world's most generous 
welfare system: There were no taxes, no charges for medical care, education or 
public land, and anyone who wanted a free house needed only to ask a king or 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
Men who had known no world beyond their tent suddenly thought nothing of flying 
first-class to London. A new school opened in Saudi Arabia every three weeks. 
Freeways twisted across the desert, and the sheik of Dubai got so exited over 
happenings in his little emirate that he used to ride construction booms up the 
sides of buildings every morning to personally inspect daily progress. 
</P>
<P>
For the gulf states, the 1970s became the Disposable Decade. Some wealthy 
residents tossed out the household furniture every six or seven months and 
changed wardrobes whenever a new line of designs arrived from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabahs of Kuwait and the other royal families who run the neighboring 
states kept what they wanted for themselves, but made sure the immense surplus 
of oil money trickled down to all levels of society. Prosperity bought peace, 
and peace enabled the rulers to continue an incestuous brand of leadership that 
brought an unusual degree of stability to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Until Iraq's attack, the Sabah family had ruled Kuwait since 1751. Sabahs 
occupied government positions of prime minister, deputy prime minister, 
minister of foreign affairs, minister of interior, minister of defense, 
minister of oil, minister of information, minister of social affairs and 
ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabahs' cousins, the Khalifas from the Otoub tribe, captured Bahrain from 
the Persians in 1783 and have governed the island ever since. In Qatar, so many 
members of the royal family are in prominent positions, it is said that if one 
Thani gets a nosebleed, every other nose in the country bleeds as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although the excesses of the gulf Arabs attracted negative attention in the 
West, many Mideast watchers believe that the Sabahs and the other rulers 
deserve credit for a great deal of responsible development. 
</P>
<P>
They built an infrastructure of roads and air links and hospitals and 
universities that provides a foundation for the next generation. They developed 
desalination plants and secondary industries, and Saudi Arabia even became a 
wheat exporter (with the government paying Saudi farmers $978 a ton, about five 
times the world market price). 
</P>
<P>
Exactly who will derive the benefit of that infrastructure is suddenly far from 
clear.

WORLD IS WATCHING BUSH-HUSSEIN SHOWDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: INSTANT GLOBAL COVERAGE BRINGS EVERY FEINT AND MOVE OF THE GULF 
CRISIS INTO THE HOME.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the advertisement, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is face to face with George 
Bush. "The World Is Watching," reads the text. On the last line are the 
initials "CNN." 
</P>
<P>
It is meant to suggest that the world is watching Turner Broadcasting's Cable 
News Network, but the advertisement for the 24-hour news channel has a another, 
perhaps unintended and more powerful, meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation with Iraq is the largest deployment of American military 
forces since the Vietnam War and the first full-scale U.S. troop commitment in 
the age of instant global communications. Today, to a degree far surpassing 
anything in Vietnam, the world truly is watching -- minute by minute, via 
satellite, in real time. 
</P>
<P>
The signs of the importance of that are everywhere. On Tuesday, for instance, 
ABC anchorman Ted Koppel gained entry to Iraq, and an exclusive Foreign 
Ministry briefing, after the Jordanian royal family summoned him to dine in 
Amman and later agreed to pass a message for him. 
</P>
<P>
The results of Koppel's briefing were broadcast within hours to America, 
carrying with them the hint that Iraq might be seeking a diplomatic solution. 
In the argot of electoral politics, international conflict had become spin 
control, with Baghdad fully engaged in the game. 
</P>
<P>
And in this war, the anchorman is not merely a messenger. He is a kind of 
neutral emissary, and the network a virtual nation-state with diplomatic 
status. 
</P>
<P>
All this raises several important questions about the news media's role in the 
Mideast confrontation: 
</P>
<P>
In the most intense crisis of his presidency, how has President Bush managed 
the public message and the media that convey it? 
</P>
<P>
How are the media, such an important influence since Vietnam, performing in the 
current crisis? 
</P>
<P>
Is it even possible that a long-term, full-scale military operation is no 
longer sustainable in the echo chamber of instant, constant global video? 
</P>
<P>
Experts who have been involved in White House and Pentagon communications say 
that the President, at least initially, handled the news media with marked 
skill. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, they suggest, television and the press initially showed a lack of 
skepticism about the Administration's actions and went out of their way to 
depict Saddam Hussein as bloodthirsty and perhaps even unstable. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, however, they note that the media echo chamber -- operating at 
hyper-speed -- seemed to have run full cycle. Some of the most influential in 
the media were casting a cold eye on American policy, a quick reminder of the 
difficult task the Administration would have maintaining public support for a 
long engagement. And, critics say, the President, since then, may have made 
some public relations missteps. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most experts argue that the success of any involvement in the Middle 
East will not rise and fall with the media. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who believe that the press shaped the outcome in Vietnam argue that 
the negative images of that war -- of a jungle ground war, of U.S. high 
technology against civilian militia, of uncertain purpose -- will not be 
repeated in the desert sand. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to be seeing the brutal, ugly kind of man-to-man combat, or 
napalm war, which was so offensive to have in our living rooms," predicted 
Michael K. Deaver, the image-maker behind former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Others argue that it is political reality, not news media interpretation, that 
determines political outcome. "Even if you had (only) the Pony Express and 
telegraph, the Vietnam War was not going to work," said David Halberstam, who 
won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of that war for the New York Times. 
"There was an essential lack of political legitimacy of the American position 
there, and eventually the media were going to reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the Iraqi crisis, White House officials say, the 
President and his aides decided to offer the public extraordinary access, 
including almost daily press briefings. That created, in effect, a continuing 
conversation with the public. "We've gone overboard to be accessible," one 
high-ranking White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Deaver says "the policy itself lent itself to a lot of information." With the 
Administration engaged in intense diplomatic negotiations, "they were very busy 
doing things which seemed to create news" -- and that generated "a feeling that 
it was under control." 
</P>
<P>
One area the Administration may have been less than candid about, however, was 
the number of troops being deployed. Initially, it indicated that about 4,000 
troops, perhaps two battalions, might be headed for Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But even the first night of the Iraqi invasion, Aug. 2, intelligence officials 
knew and told at least one reporter that 85,000 to 90,000 troops probably would 
go. Apparently they offered a lower figure publicly to avoid provoking a 
reaction in Iraq or shocking the American public. 
</P>
<P>
While Administration officials say now it would be unwise militarily to be too 
precise with troop figures, former White House communications director David 
Gergen also cautions against continuing to be disingenuous about numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to get into that as a steady diet if you have to increase your 
numbers there. . . ," he said. "That dredges up too many memories" of 
untrustworthy troop and casualty figures in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Another wrinkle of the initial Bush media strategy was that, aside from 
presidential news conferences, the Administration did little to try to overtly 
control the "spin" or interpretation of events in the first few days, 
particularly in the way it depicted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. For more than 
a week, for instance, Administration officials refused all invitations to 
appear on network TV news programs. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly mattered. Critics charge that, in place of a reticent Administration, 
the press by itself did much to characterize events the way the Administration 
would have wanted. Time magazine even did a psychological profile that included 
an Israeli intelligence handwriting analysis concluding that Hussein "suffered 
from severe megalomania with symptoms of paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Kalb, the longtime NBC and CBS chief diplomatic correspondent who 
teaches press and public policy courses at Harvard University, believes the 
press showed "an inadequate degree of skepticism" during that critical first 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I make no case for Saddam Hussein, but we have dealt in the past with very 
unpleasant types," Kalb explained. Whipping up anti-Iraq sentiment, he 
suggested, "is not the measure of what is in the best interests of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein himself, he noted, "was a crucial ally for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Bowdoin College professor David Kertzer warned that characterizing events too 
simplistically might leave the American public unable to understand such 
factors as Hussein's support in other Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage of the Arab perspective became more sophisticated in time, monitoring 
of daily press coverage suggests, as more reporters actually reached the Middle 
East. The change was particularly marked on the networks, which tended to have 
fewer reporters in place at first. 
</P>
<P>
But with cycles moving so quickly, by the weekend the President was facing 
criticism from the highest quarters of the press for policies that in midweek 
had been widely praised. Instant public opinion polls in the Washington Post 
and New York Times detected a fragile, perhaps short-lived public support. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times on Page 1 went so far as to virtually dismiss American 
policy in the gulf: "Laid bare," it said, "troops have been sent to retain 
control of oil in the hands of a pro-American Saudi Arabia so (oil) prices will 
remain low." Then, quoting an editorial cartoon, it concluded that "they are 
there to defend the security . . . the value . . . the principle we hold dear 
-- 18 miles per gallon." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post editorial page editor Meg Greenfield wrote that she could 
"already hear the distinct drip . . . drip . . . drip . . ." of public support 
leaking away. 
</P>
<P>
And this week, the networks have focused not so much on Hussein's bloody past 
as on such matters as the less lofty purpose behind American involvement. "Had 
Saudi Arabia not had oil," CBS quoted one expert as saying Wednesday, "it would 
have been thrown . . . to the dogs." 
</P>
<P>
It was as if in an age when the media are increasingly interpretive, a 
journalistic "scoop" had been replaced by the rush to write the next level of 
analysis, every cycle gaining centrifugal velocity. It is the same movie we 
have seen before, this time played at triple speed. 
</P>
<P>
The answers from the best experts on the murky art of media control offer 
divergent if not completely contradictory advice on how Bush should buttress 
the Administration politically and hold together the fragile domestic and 
international coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Gergen suggested that the President should deliver a prime-time speech soon 
"that explains in the very clearest possible terms what his purpose and goals 
are" to stem "increasing pressure on the right wing to raise the stakes . . . 
and increasing pressure from the left, particularly overseas, to compromise for 
a lesser outcome." The President's brief, early-morning address of last week -- 
unseen by most Americans -- was insufficient, Gergen believes. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as former Reagan Administration communications director Thomas 
Griscom, said being too specific about actual policy goals would set up the 
President for criticism. "Once you start putting particular benchmarks out 
there, then you have to achieve them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
President Jimmy Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell, said the real danger is 
for the President to become too concerned with these short-term pressures by 
the press, which demand a new plot change every day, and a new chapter every 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"In a general sense, the temptation to do something because it will look good 
in the short term ought to be resisted," Powell advised. 
</P>
<P>
Indulging that temptation, some believe, may already have hurt the 
Administration. On Tuesday, the President returned to Washington from vacation 
to deliver an uncharacteristically blistering partisan attack on the Democrats 
over the budget. At least some in the media, such as National Public Radio's 
Cokie Roberts, said it was an attempt to shift the focus of attention somewhat 
away from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the maneuver apparently did not work. The story that night and next 
morning remained focused on Iraq, and the President was criticized even within 
his own party for his political charges. The following day, Bush switched gears 
and delivered his most blistering attack yet on Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, if handled properly, the Iraq story will become a constant of life 
and fade from the top of Page 1, former Reagan communications director Griscom 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
When that occurs, Halberstam agreed, that will make the Bush Administration's 
job easier. "At the height of interest, the President's hands are more tied," 
he said. "As it goes down from media overkill, the President has more play." 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason why those involved in the news media on both sides believe 
that sustaining a military involvement over a long period of time is still 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hoffman, who did four tours in Vietnam for the Associated Press, covered 
the military for 25 years and finally became the Pentagon press spokesman for 
Reagan, said the differences between the Iraq confrontation and Vietnam are 
drastic. For one, the importance of American interests is clearer this time. 
For another, he said, the Vietnam War dragged on for four years before public 
support started to flag, in about 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Deaver argued that the degree of international support of the American 
situation this time is another significant difference, as is the fact that 
Hussein invaded Iraq, invoking memories of Hitler's blitzkriegs. 
</P>
<P>
True, the experts said, with more media constantly echoing themselves, there is 
now a sensation of hyper-dramatization and hyper-impact greater than during the 
war in Vietnam. Movie director Oliver Stone told the American Psychological 
Assn. last week that, "is hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Yet those who know that "hysteria" best concur with Powell, the spokesman for 
the Carter Administration that was itself done in partly by a crisis in the 
Middle East: "The substance, in the end, is what matters most."

U.S., SOVIET UNION AGREE TO EXPAND LEGAL COOPERATION

<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union agreed Friday to expand their 
cooperation on legal affairs issues ranging from consumer protection to civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of talks on the legal systems of the two superpowers, Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh and Soviet Justice Minister Veniamin F. Yakovlev broadened the 
cooperation agreement reached in Moscow last October. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic event," said Yakovlev. "This has started a process of 
cooperation that will continue." 
</P>
<P>
The two officials agreed to continue regular exchanges of information, which 
will be expanded to include consumer protection, civil cases, civil rights and 
federalism -- the system under which power is divided by a constitution between 
central and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed to study a possible mutual legal assistance treaty and to 
consult on judicial and prison issues. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said the meetings achieved a major step forward. 
</P>

W. GERMANY HOLDS 7 FOR AIDING IRAQ ON POISON GAS FACILITIES 
</P>

West German authorities Friday arrested seven people, including a former 
intelligence officer of Iraqi descent, and accused them of helping Iraq build 
poison gas installations, a state prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich Hoffmann, a senior state prosecutor in Darmstadt, said the suspects 
are suspected of violating West German export legislation by selling sensitive 
technology to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
He said investigations have been under way for several years because the 
authorities needed to prove the technology was destined for use in poison gas 
factories, which are similar to herbicide manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann said among those arrested was a man identified as Al Khadi, 51, a West 
German citizen of Iraqi descent who once worked for the Federal Information 
Service, the West German intelligence agency comparable to the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Khadi, who had also served as a representative of the West German firm 
Preussag in Iraq, was sentenced to death by the Iraqi authorities for spying. 
After intervention by senior West German officials, the sentence was commuted 
to life imprisonment. Khadi was later released and allowed to return to West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann said employees of the Pilot Plant, Preussag and Water Engineering 
Trading firms were among those arrested, but stressed that the companies were 
not believed to have been involved in the illegal deals. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed claims in the West German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel 
that West Germans had played a major role in the development of nerve gas 
factories in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest edition, the magazine said Khadi had supplied chemical 
installations to Iraq through the Hamburg-based WET, of which he is a part 
owner and manager. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the factory was designed to produce lethal Tabun and Sarin 
nerve gases. It said Iraq also bought from WET tons of components used for the 
production of nerve gases. 
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel said Preussag employees had worked together with Khadi on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests follow a string of scandals over the export to potential conflict 
areas of technology for chemical and biological warfare. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a West German industrialist was sentenced to five years imprisonment 
for helping build a chemical weapons plant in Rabta, near the Libyan capital of 
Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the West German Defense Ministry said the East 
German military is still training Iraqi and Libyan officers. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the authorities in Bonn have asked the East German 
government to cancel the training agreements.

Israel's chief rabbi has asked religious Jews to carry scissors so they can 
remove their beards to accommodate gas masks if Iraq threatens Israel with 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu ruled that Orthodox Jews need not follow a biblical ban 
on shaving beards -- if their lives are in danger. Under Jewish law, saving a 
life takes precedence over all other requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Some religious scholars believe the Bible meant for beards to distinguish Jews 
from non-Jews. But beards could interfere with the seal of the gas masks that 
Israel would issue to defend against an Iraqi poison gas attack.

Friends and foes of proposed ballot propositions would have to publicly

<P>
A 57-13 vote sent the bill (SB 284) by Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) back

"We've got to make sure that the people find out who's behind the initiatives

Stan Statham (R-Oak Run), who carried the bill. "California's laws should not 
be for sale." 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission has reported that more than $29 million 
was spent during the qualification period for initiatives that appeared on the 
November, 1988, ballot.

RESERVISTS CONTACTED ON MEDICAL DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors, nurses and other medical reservists in Southern California and across 
the country are being asked to consider serving at military hospitals should 
shortages of medical personnel develop because of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the Army surgeon general in Washington, who declined to be 
identified, said that office started the recruitment operation, which he 
described as unprecedented in its scope and speed, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Army Reserve administrators in Santa Ana, San Bernardino and Riverside on 
Thursday began calling about 120 medically trained reservists in Southern 
California, asking them to decide within 24 hours if they would be willing to 
do duty at a U.S.-based hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is developing a contingency plan in the event that the Army 
medical staff is used up and moved out to the Middle East," said Walter 
Shelton, staff administrator at the Army Hospital in Ventura, which oversees 
all local medical reserve units. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton called the response positive but declined to provide figures on how 
many have accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Those reservists contacted are being offered a choice of three hospitals. They 
could work for a period of three months to perhaps a year.

HISTORIC OLD OAKS BEING POISONED IN LOUISIANA

Authorities say that more than a dozen oak trees, including some placed on a 
national tree register, have been poisoned in the area in the last three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Vermilion Parish County Agent Howard Cormier said the poison, believed to be a 
herbicide similar to the one that almost killed the historic Treaty Oak in 
Austin, Tex., has reached the vascular systems of some of the trees and 
probably will kill them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the poisoned trees is a live oak that is eight feet in diameter and is 
150 to 200 years old. Nine trees in Abbeville and five more outside the city 
limits have been reported poisoned, Cormier said.

GUNMAN FREES HOSTAGES AFTER 1 1/2 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH and NIESON HIMMEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disgruntled, gun-wielding former McDonnell Douglas employee held three people 
hostage for 1 1/2 hours Friday at a Torrance union headquarters and finally 
surrendered when he "found out he wasn't going to get a chance to talk to 
reporters," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Dishman, 39, of Los Angeles, was booked on suspicion of false 
imprisonment and assault with a deadly weapon after the standoff, Torrance 
Police Lt. Steve Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in here holding a gun at his side and said, 'This is a hostage 
situation,' and told me to call 911. Then he fired three rounds into the 
ceiling," said George Aldridge, 46, a union business agent who was held 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept talking (to the police) and he started dialing a list of phone numbers 
of TV stations and even called the Pentagon but they didn't answer." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 4:10 p.m. at District 720 headquarters of the 
International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 7,000 
McDonnell Douglas workers in the Torrance area. A police SWAT squad was called 
to the scene but was never able to make contact with Dishman. 
</P>
<P>
Aldridge said, "It was something to do with McDonnell Douglas. He wasn't upset 
with the union, just with the company." 
</P>
<P>
Police earlier said he seemed disgruntled because he felt the union had not 
done enough for him when he was discharged by the aircraft firm. 
</P>
<P>
Held at gunpoint with Aldridge were Barbara Powley, 40, secretary-treasurer of 
the local, and Gladys Mason, 47, another business agent. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff ended just as abruptly as it began, Aldridge said. "The reason the 
guy walked out was because the police weren't going to let him talk to 
reporters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Dishman walked out of the building, he turned to TV news crews and yelled, 
"McDonnell builds (inferior) planes. It's a matter of national defense and 
they're lousy." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas spokesmen were not available for comment Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really relieved when he left," Powley said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Aldridge: "I feel like God was with me that no one got hurt. You watch 
this stuff on TV but you don't expect it to happen to you."

RAM FANS EXPECTED TO GET LONGER LOOK AT WARNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an exhibition that otherwise offers little, tailback Curt Warner will make 
his first start as a Ram tonight. The San Diego Chargers will provide the 
opposition in the 46th annual Times/Rams Charity Game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, 29, has rushed for 6,705 yards and 55 touchdowns in the NFL. Still, 
there is much anticipation to see whether he remains the runner he was for the 
Seattle Seahawks, who obviously didn't think so when they made him an 
unprotected Plan B free agent last spring. 
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, the Rams have guarded Warner's workload, careful not to 
expose him to excess scrutiny. Last week in West Berlin, Warner made only a 
token appearance, rushing for 12 yards in five carries, leaving the foreign 
spotlight to Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
But tonight, Warner will line up with the first-team offense -- at least what 
is left of it -- and perhaps carry with him a glimpse of the team's future. 
</P>
<P>
While Coach John Robinson maintains that Warner will never again carry the ball 
300 times in a season, as he has in previous years, he believes the former Penn 
State star can be an effective runner and leader on a young team with its 
sights set on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, Warner begins a new chapter in his career tonight, although 
Robinson said he has nothing to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"In games, no," Robinson said. "He just has to show me that he's ready to do 
what he can do, and he shows that on the practice field -- he still has the 
zest for playing. He has demonstrated that the last couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Warner showed it again in Thursday's practice when he popped linebacker Fred 
Strickland in the face mask after being tackled during a heated goal-line 
rushing drill. 
</P>
<P>
Warner has also been pushed somewhat by the emerging Green, who rushed for 115 
yards last Saturday against the Kansas City Chiefs. With Cleveland Gary still 
sidelined because of a lower back strain, Green will attempt to further improve 
his stock in relief of Warner tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Warner will kind of have the lead role, with Gaston playing a lot," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the game will be typical of most exhibitions. Quarterback Jim 
Everett, who played a quarter last week, will play no more than the first two 
offensive series against the Chargers. Chuck Long, resigned to mop-up duty with 
the reserves last week, will get a shot with the first unit, which will not 
include injured starting receivers Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he might alternate both backup quarterbacks, Long and Mark 
Herrmann, throughout the game so that they can be evaluated against the same 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Rams and the Chargers are teams trying to survive another summer of 
contract disputes. The Rams have five veteran holdouts: Jackie Slater, Kevin 
Greene, Damone Johnson, Doug Reed and Michael Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers still haven't signed two key players on defense -- outside 
linebacker Leslie O'Neal and first-round choice Junior Seau. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said there's little he can do but wait. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age, I don't know how you can get concerned," he said of his 
two holdouts. "I don't know how you compute the numbers. There doesn't seem to 
be any rhyme or reason on the numbers; that people can be so far apart and 
then, eventually, it gets done. When you start out a million (dollars) apart, I 
can't get concerned with that. I don't even want to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Henning has turned his attention instead to quarterback, where he must choose 
between second-year player Billy Joe Tolliver and Mark Vlasic, who missed all 
of 1989 recovering from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he will play his starters for about a half against the Rams. 
"We'll give Tolliver the lion's share of the work," he said. "Where we'll give 
it to him in the game, I'm not sure at this point. Then the next priority is to 
get Vlasic a good deal of work." 
</P>
<P>
As for the season opener, Henning said: "Right now, the plan is to play with 
Tolliver." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
George Menefee, who is in his 36th season as Ram trainer, will be honored at 
halftime tonight. He has been with the team since 1955, having been hired by 
Sid Gillman. Menefee will turn 75 in October. . . . Former Ram linebacker 
Richard Brown is trying to catch on in San Diego and reportedly is doing well. 
"Richard's had a good camp," Coach Dan Henning said. "He's worked real hard and 
he has a shot." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams might be catching the Packers at the right time when they open the 
regular season in Green Bay, Wis., Sept. 9. The Packers, who have yet to sign 
quarterback Don Majkowski, lost running back Brent Fullwood Friday. He 
underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove cartilage in his right knee. The team 
is saying he could miss the opener. . . . NFL teams must trim rosters to 60 
players by Aug. 28, then to 47 by Sept. 3.

major tournament in which the Americans have failed to win the gold medal, 
dating to the 1987 Pan American Games at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia (6-1) will face the Soviet Union, which defeated Puerto Rico, 98-82, 
for the world championship Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States (5-2) will face Puerto Rico today for the bronze medal. 
Puerto Rico beat the United States, 81-79, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's game was a rematch of the Goodwill final in Seattle, an 85-79 victory 
for the Yugoslavs. Petrovic did not play in that game; he and Vlade Divac of 
the Lakers joined the team for the world championships. Divac, who fouled out, 
had seven points. Petrovic had 31 points in 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Mike Krzyzewski had no excuses. "I thought our team played very 
well. If we didn't, we'd have lost by 30. I thought they were the best team and 
they played every bit like it today." 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic, who plays for the Portland Trail Blazers, is recovering from flu but 
still was impressive, finishing with six three-pointers. His final 
three-pointer, with 6:23 remaining, gave Yugoslavia its biggest lead, 90-71. 
</P>
<P>
The United States came close several times but never pulled even, despite 
making 37 for 60 from the field. Alonzo Mourning led the Americans with 26 
points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just Petrovic who gave the Americans fits. Toni Kukoc, a second-round 
pick of the Chicago Bulls, had 19 points and nine assists. Zarko Paspalj, who 
plays for the San Antonio Spurs, had 15 points and made all three of his 
three-point shots. Reserve center Zoran Savic added 14 points.

MORNING BRIEFING: THE ONLY ROAR AT U.S. OPEN WILL COME FROM THE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At major tennis tournaments, players' whining is one form of noise pollution. 
And there are times when the chair umpire has to quiet the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But to New York Mayor David Dinkins and Queens Borough President Claire 
Shulman, the worst noise of all is the roar of jetliners over the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that the two have persuaded the Federal Aviation 
Administration to reroute planes taking off from La Guardia Airport during 
tournament play Aug. 27-Sept. 9. Certain residents of Flushing won't like it, 
but Dinkins and Shulman will take that chance. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Tennis Assn. has said it will consider the noise problem when it 
decides whether to keep the Open at the U.S. Tennis Center after its lease runs 
out in 1994. In their request to the FAA, Dinkins and Claire emphasized "the 
unique status of this event and its economic benefit to the city." They 
estimated the latter at more than $100 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the first pitcher to win an All-Star game and a World 
Series game in the same season? 
</P>
<P>
25-cent solution: From Wilfrid Sheed, in a Gentleman's Quarterly article 
arguing for the admission of Shoeless Joe Jackson to baseball's Hall of Fame: 
"Perhaps the best solution would be for the whole mishmash known as baseball to 
declare a separation of powers, in which the commissioner punishes your sins 
while the Hall of Fame acknowledges your achievements, the way having your face 
on a stamp does." 
</P>
<P>
Big Red machine: On the Santa Monica Freeway, Times staff writer Jerry Crowe 
spotted a car decked out with University of Nebraska paraphernalia. Its bumper 
sticker read: "If I owned Oklahoma and Hell, I'd live in Hell and rent out 
Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Just be patient, baby: Recent headline in the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch: 
"Al Davis makes eighth trip to Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Root for the brain: Mario Johnson, Missouri's 6-foot-5, 314-pound defensive 
tackle, told Doug Tucker of the AP that he'd been bullied as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "My body matured before my brain did. That got me in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when I was in the fourth grade, high school kids would jump on me. I 
never see those people anymore. I wish I did. It would be pay-back time." 
</P>
<P>
Wild times seemed to follow him, even during his recruitment period. 
</P>
<P>
At a party when he was visiting Pittsburgh, a man got shot, and police rushed 
in. At a party at Colorado, a brawl broke out. "I really threw some punches," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Johnson: He finally narrowed his choices to Michigan and Colorado. But 10 
minutes before he was to announce his decision at a news conference, a call 
came from his older brother Lee, who was playing at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two had a difficult relationship at times, Mario recalled: "I 
said, 'I'm going to miss the chance to play with you.' He said he really wanted 
to play with me. . . . Then the emotion just burst out in me. I said, 'I love 
you, and you come before any school. Where my brother is, I am going to be.' I 
went out there and said Missouri is where I'm going."

Rafael Ruelas of Arleta ran his record to 20-0 with 17 knockouts by stopping 
Job Walters of Jamaica in the ninth round of a scheduled 10-round featherweight 
bout Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, 19, who fights out of the Ten Goose Boxing Club in Van Nuys, is ranked 
No. 20 by the World Boxing Council. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped Walters with a left hook in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
By the eighth round, Walters' right eye was bleeding and badly swollen. In the 
ninth, Ruelas, 126 1/2, rocked Walters (12-5) with another left hook and then 
landed several punches until referee Toby Gibson stopped the fight at 2:10 of 
the round. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 125, came into the fight off impressive victories over former world 
champions Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela and Azael Moran of New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the main event at Bally's Casino Resort, Donald Curry knocked out Jose Duran 
Martinez with a right uppercut in the fourth round of their middleweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, 156, the former world welterweight and WBC super-welterweight champion, 
is the International Boxing Federation's No. 1 middleweight contender and will 
meet champion Michael Nunn Oct. 18 in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, of Ft. Worth, improved to 33-3 with 24 knockouts. Martinez, 159, of San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, fell to 15-5, six by knockout.

Both sides in the dispute that threatened to cancel a Soviet-NHL exhibition 
series claimed victory after the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation decided to go 
ahead with a tour of NHL cities this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Federation President Leonid Kravchenko said in Moscow that the Soviets had 
agreed to the full schedule of 29 exhibitions. Kravchenko said the decision was 
made after the NHL had "promised to give legal guarantees that there will be no 
future situations where 'stealing' of our players will occur." 
</P>
<P>
However, Alan Eagleson, head of the NHL Players' Assn., said the league could 
give no such assurances.

NEWSWIRE: LAWSUIT IS DISAVOWED BY 14 YANKEE CO-OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the battle of New York rages on, it's getting harder and harder to figure 
out who is fighting whom. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees' limited partners who sued to keep George Steinbrenner in power got 
no support from other co-owners Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the 18 limited partners said they would not join in the lawsuit, 
filed in U.S. District Court by part-owners Daniel R. McCarthy and Harold M. 
Bowman Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on their request for a restraining order is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, who remains under threat of further discipline from Commissioner 
Fay Vincent, repeated his opposition to the suit. Robert Nederlander, selected 
to succeed Steinbrenner as general partner, also said he was against it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Steinbrenner's attorneys continued their attack on Vincent by calling 
for baseball owners to appoint an independent counsel to conduct "a complete 
and thorough investigation of the commissioner's actions." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a lawsuit in which the partners are, technically, suing themselves, 
limited partner Charlotte Witkind observed: "This is like 'Alice in 
Wonderland,' curiouser and curiouser." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Steinbrenner told the commissioner's office that Jack Lawn, former 
Drug Enforcement Adminstration chief, would take over the team Monday and 
remain in power until Nederlander or someone else is approved as general 
partner by league owners.

NICKLAUS, NORMAN WAIT FOR A COMPLETE ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus and defending champion Greg Norman have an overnight wait to see 
if they will advance into today's third round of the storm-delayed 
International tournament at Castle Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Norman and Nicklaus each finished with three points moments before darkness 
halted second-round play Friday night on the Castle Pines Golf Club course. 
</P>
<P>
A three-hour rain and lightning delay left 32 players stranded on the course. 
They are scheduled to complete the round this morning. Some have as many as six 
holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Until all players are finished, the qualifying score to make it into the third 
round will not be known. 
</P>
<P>
Medal scores do not count in this event. Points are awarded on the player's 
performance on each hole: 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par, -1 for bogey 
and -3 for double bogey or higher. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared a score of three points would be necessary to make it into a 
playoff for the final qualifying spots. 
</P>
<P>
After the completion of 36 holes, the 144-man field will be cut to the 72 
players with the highest point totals. Those 72 then will compete for 24 places 
in Sunday's final round. 
</P>
<P>
Norman had to make a last-gasp rally to have any chance at all. He birdied both 
the 16th and 17th holes, but missed a 15-foot putt on the 18th for the birdie 
that would have secured a spot in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who designed the course in the eastern foothills of the Rockies, 
missed an even shorter birdie putt on the 18th, from about six feet. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, among the group stranded on the course, held a one-point 
lead with one hole to go. He had 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Romero of Argentina was the leader in the clubhouse with 20 points, 11 
of which he accumulated in Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Elkington of Australia was next at 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rives McBee set a tournament record with an eight-under 64 in the first round 
of the Senior Showdown tournament at Jeremy Ranch, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
McBee shot 32-32 on the 7,103-yard mountain course, highlighted by an eagle on 
the first hole when he chipped in with a wedge. 
</P>
<P>
Don Bies and Mike Hill were tied at 66, one stroke in front of Phil Rogers, Lee 
Trevino, and George Archer. Bob Betley and John Paul Cain were at 68. 
</P>
<P>
Tammie Green shot a three-under-par 69 for a 36-hole total of 137 and 
maintained her one-stroke lead at the LPGA Big Apple tournament at New 
Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never led after two rounds," Green said. "My game is good enough to 
stay there so now it's a matter of proving it." 
</P>
<P>
Green will have to prove against a formidable field. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Jones was second after shooting a 69 for 138. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Coe and Daniel shot 70s, and were tied for third at 140 with Marci Bozarth 
and Danielle Ammaccapane, who each had 71. 
</P>
<P>
Dottie Mochrie's 69 gave her a 141, followed by Betsy King, Kristi Albers, Jan 
Stephenson, Cathy Morse, Cindy Schreyer and Kris Monaghan at 142.

Unseeded Peter Lundgren of Sweden upset second-seeded Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-0, 
in less than an hour Friday to reach the semifinals of the $1-million U.S. 
Hardcourts tournament in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Boris Becker of West Germany, a game away from defeat in the second 
set, won his quarterfinal match when Jim Courier retired in the third set with 
cramps. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's 4-6, 7-5, 3-1 victory sent him into the semifinals against 
fourth-seeded Jay Berger. 
</P>
<P>
Courier, seeded eighth, had Becker down, 5-2, in the second set before he held 
serve and broke Courier twice to force a third set. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier matches, Berger, seeded fourth, beat Kelly Evernden, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, 
with five service breaks over the final two sets, and No. 14 Richey Reneberg 
upset eighth-seeded Pete Sampras 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-0). 
</P>
<P>
Agassi managed only one service break against Lundgren, ranked 151st in the 
world. Lundgren raced to a 4-1 lead in the first set before Agassi recovered 
and served a love-game to climb within 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old from Las Vegas had a break point in the next game, but he could 
only lunge at Lundgren's forehand winner on the baseline. Then his unforced 
error gave Lundgren the first set in 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"That was his chance to come back and I won the game. He just went for stupid 
shots. He's such a good player and he should know better," Lundgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he was distracted by an incident that occurred earlier Friday. He 
refused to elaborate, however. 
</P>
<P>
"He should feel pretty good that he caught me today. Otherwise he would've had 
a game on his hands," said Agassi, who won only four points in the final three 
games. The match lasted 56 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Evernden, ranked 78th in the world, had little energy after his 6-2, 6-4 upset 
of fifth-seeded John McEnroe, the defending champion, in Thursday's third 
round. And his exhaustion showed. 
</P>
<P>
Berger led Evernden 4-3, 30-love on his serve when he committed three 
consecutive unforced errors. Evernden swept seven of the next eight points over 
two games to break Berger and hold serve for a 5-4 lead. He won the set, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Berger broke Evernden three times in the second set, allowing his opponent only 
13 points. The world's 11th-ranked player collected two breaks in the final 
set, and served a 40-love game to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Woodbridge of Australia and Derrick Rostagno defeated two of the remaining 
three seeded players to advance to the semifinals of the Volvo International 
tournament, in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
In the other quarterfinal matches, fifth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet 
Union beat Cristiano Carati of Italy, 6-2, 6-1, and Todd Woddbridge of 
Australia defeated Bryan Shelton, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's powerful forehand led him past 11th-seeded Wally Masur, 7-6 (7-5) 
3-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
After defeating Masur in a first set tiebreaker, Woodbridge, 19, said he lost 
his concentration after going up 3-2 in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
After Masur took a 4-1 lead in the third set, Woodbridge fought back, running 
off eight straight points to cut the margin to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
He then came back from 0-40 in the final game and ran off five points to win 
the set, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno scored a 7-5, 6-0 victory over 16th-seeded Christo van Rensburg of 
South Africa.

ISRAELI PUTS HIS DREAM ON LINE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: CERRITOS GUARD CAME TO SOUTHLAND TO PURSUE A COLLEGE 
SCHOLARSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gali Horev grew up in Israel dreaming of becoming an American basketball star. 
Nine months ago, the dream became a possibility when he and his father, Jacob 
Horev, moved to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the move was solely to get Horev the necessary exposure to earn 
a scholarship to an American college. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gali doesn't get the scholarship he wants," Jacob Horev said, "then we 
probably will get on the first plane back to Israel. We moved here for a 
specific reason, and if it doesn't happen, then there is no purpose in 
staying." 
</P>
<P>
The Horevs arrived in Los Angeles Nov. 27. One week later, Gali enrolled at 
Cerritos High and immediately joined the basketball team. Although he was a 
standout for several club teams in Tel Aviv, Horev wasn't geared for the 
fast-paced game played in America and saw limited action as a reserve guard for 
the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
Unaccustomed to sitting on the bench, Horev used the time to study the 
intricacies of the game. Although basketball is popular in Israel, it is 
somewhat unsophisticated. It took Horev months to learn all of the different 
formations and plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to completely change my game style," said Horev, a 6-foot-5, 180-pound 
off-guard. "In Israel, basically all we did was run up and down the court and 
shoot the ball. Here, the game is much more physical. I wasn't used to all of 
the pushing and shoving. The players also are a lot faster. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was still hard for me to sit on the bench, because I believed I could 
help the team and make a contribution. I got very anxious, but I realize now 
that I just wasn't ready. I've really learned a lot since then." 
</P>
<P>
Horev, 17, has been practicing and playing games almost every day since April. 
He was selected to all-star squads for three Slam-n-Jam leagues and was invited 
to the Superstar Camp in Santa Barbara last month. He currently is in West 
Germany with his high school team playing in a series of exhibitions. The 
increased exposure has resulted in some attention from college coaches. Horev 
received his first recruiting letter last week, from UC Davis, a Division II 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very exciting to get that letter," his father said. "Let's just hope 
there are more on the way." 
</P>
<P>
Gali Horev grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city with a population of 
325,000. He started playing basketball on the playground when he was 10, but 
was persuaded to switch to the more popular game of soccer two years later. 
When he found it increasingly difficult to find cleats in his size (he wears a 
13 1/2 shoe), Horev decided it was time to take up basketball again. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody with Gali's size and ability should be on the basketball court and 
not the soccer field," said Jacob Horev. 
</P>
<P>
Gali Horev played for Hapoel, one of Tel Aviv's top club teams, as well as for 
a team from his high school and one from a local semipro league. He said he 
practiced and played games every day for nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball has been, and is my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horev's immediate future in the sport would have been jeopardized if he had 
stayed in Israel. There are no athletic scholarships. More important, however, 
everyone must serve three years in the army upon high school graduation. After 
the military, many players try out for one of several semipro or professional 
leagues in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But Horev was luckier than most because he had options. His father was a 
colonel in the army and a man of moderate wealth. When he retired from the 
military in 1988, Jacob Horev decided it was time to devote himself to his son. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up a poor child with little opportunities," said Horev, who was a 
mechanical engineer in the army. "Everything I earned, I did with my own two 
hands. I just didn't want Gali to grow up and blame me for not giving him 
opportunities. This whole move was for him. If it doesn't work out, at least I 
know we tried. I would have knocked myself until I died if I didn't at least 
give Gali the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the risks are all on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
The Horevs discussed moving to the United States for a couple of years. Jacob, 
his wife Shuly, and their three children lived in Boston in 1979-81 while he 
was working on his master's degree in engineering at Boston University. Gali 
Horev enjoyed his time there and perfected his English. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Horevs liked Boston, Jacob decided this time they would move to 
Southern California because he had traveled here frequently and liked the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Boston was a bit cold with the snow and all," he said. "Los Angeles has 
weather similar to that of Tel Aviv, except without all of the humidity." 
</P>
<P>
Since Jacob and Gali weren't certain how long their stay in Southern California 
would last, the rest of the Horev family stayed behind. Gali said first he 
wanted to see if he would fit in on an American team before the move was made 
permanent. Shortly after their arrival, several of Jacob's friends who lived in 
the area suggested that they settle in Cerritos. After meeting with Cerritos 
High's principal, athletic director and basketball coach, they felt comfortable 
with what they saw and heard, and decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Horev quickly secured visas and began working on getting his family 
reunited. He took a job as a systems engineer with ZMD American in Paramount. 
After an eight-month separation, Shuly and the Horevs' other son, Nimi, finally 
moved to Cerritos earlier this month. Nirit, the eldest of the children, stayed 
in Israel to fulfill her military obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Everything did not go smoothly for Gali Horev in the beginning. His course load 
included classes in English composition, Spanish and American history. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew how to speak English pretty well," he said, "but trying to learn 
Spanish at the same time was very difficult. My counselor told me I needed a 
foreign language to get into college, and I asked if I could take Hebrew. They 
didn't offer Hebrew at Cerritos, so I was stuck with Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough, but I made it." 
</P>
<P>
Horev finished the spring semester with a 3.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The Cerritos basketball team, coached by Jim Chapel, welcomed the arrival of 
Horev. Players went out of their way to help him with drills and to familiarize 
him with plays. Chapel said he brought Horev along slowly to make the 
transition easier. 
</P>
<P>
"When Gali arrived, he was completely an international type of ballplayer," 
said Chapel, in his fourth year at the school. "He didn't have a whole lot of 
structure to his game. I definitely saw potential with him, but he had to learn 
our system. He had to adapt." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos finished second in the traditionally strong San Gabriel Valley League 
at 21-6 and was eliminated by Mater Dei in the second round of the Southern 
Section Division 5-A playoffs. Horev can recount every game he played and the 
excitement of going to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
When the season finished in March, Chapel told Horev about several recreational 
leagues and camps. Horev opted to play for Slam-n-Jam and was placed on three 
different teams. With the Bears of the Saddleback midweek league, Horev 
averaged 23.4 points in seven games and was selected to the all-star team. 
Horev also played 30 games with his high school team, which played in two 
summer leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Gali is getting the playing time he so desperately needed," said Issy 
Washington, director of Slam-n-Jam. "He has all the tools to be a good player, 
so now it's just a matter of getting used to our style of basketball. He's very 
eager and persistent, which will go a long way in helping him get a college 
scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Horev, who has grown two inches and gained 25 pounds since December, has been a 
regular starter in spring and summer league play. He routinely finished in 
double figures in scoring and rebounding. His strength is his shooting, and he 
is particularly accurate from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Horev, who rarely misses a game, said: "Parents are coming up to me and 
putting their arms around me and telling how well Gali is doing. It brings 
tears to my eyes because I'm so proud of his achievements. He just has to keep 
working and getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mark Flick, a 6-9 center at Cerritos: "When Gali first got here, everybody 
wanted to take him around and make him feel welcome. I introduced him around, 
but pretty soon he knew more people than me. He's always got a smile on his 
face and he's very friendly. The whole school knows who he is now. He's very 
popular." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the popularity among his peers and improvement on the court, Horev 
hasn't forgotten the reason he came to America. His goal remains a college 
scholarship. Since he didn't arrive at Cerritos until the middle of his junior 
year, Horev has gotten a late start in the recruiting game. Most Division I 
recruits will sign a letter of intent in November, months before they even 
finish their senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts were unaware of Horev until recently, which means if he is offered a 
scholarship, it probably will be in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Chapel and Washington agree that Horev has the size and skills to play college 
basketball, but they aren't sure at what level. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably a Division II prospect right now," Washington said. "But when a 
kid is improving as rapidly as he is, anything can happen. He might blossom all 
of a sudden and take everyone by storm. That kind of thing happens all of the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos will have a strong contingent of players returning, headed by Flick, 
who is considered a Division I prospect. Chapel said he expects Horev to be in 
the starting lineup as the team's main shooting threat from outside. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep telling me I'm getting better," Horev said. "I'm flattered by the 
compliments, but for me, the proof of all that will be getting a scholarship. I 
won't be satisfied until I achieve that. And I'll be disappointed if I don't."

CARDINALS' TEWKSBURY BEATS ASTROS AFTER STUBBS RUINS PERFECT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Tewksbury, once one of the New York Yankees' top prospects, was the No. 12 
pitcher on the St. Louis Cardinals' staff coming out of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason he was on the roster was the lockout that shortened spring 
training and kept pitchers behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the 29-year-old right-hander no longer the last man on the staff, 
he is one of the bright spots in a dismal season for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
After his performance Friday night at St. Louis, and with John Tudor on the 
disabled list, Tewksbury is probably the staff's top pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Tewksbury had a perfect game until Franklin Stubbs punched a double to left to 
open the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Tewksbury (8-3) settled for a one-hitter and a 5-0 victory over the Houston 
Astros. Tewksbury, who won nine games for the Yankees in 1986 before developing 
arm trouble, was 1-0 with the Cardinals after being brought up late last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tewksbury's earned-run average is 2.78, but in his last 10 starts, it is 1.68. 
He has not given up a walk in his last three starts. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to go all the way," Tewksbury said, "but I really feel 
good about the way I pitched. It will probably feel good for four more days, 
then it'll be time to pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sinker down and away that Stubbs hit. The only way he could get a hit 
was to punch it. Unfortunately, that's what he did. If he pulls it, it's a 
ground out." 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs, the Astros' cleanup hitter, said he knew the Astros were in trouble 
because he kept leading off innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He takes a little off, puts a little on," Stubbs said. "He had it all 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Tewksbury settled for his second consecutive shutout. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get much better than that," Cardinal Manager Joe Torre said. "That 
was a clinic, a real masterpiece." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7-4, Cincinnati 1-3 -- The Pirates brought Mike York, a 25-year-old 
right-hander, up from the minors to pitch the first game of this doubleheader 
at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
There might be second thoughts about sending him back right away. 
</P>
<P>
York held the leaders of the West to six hits and no runs in seven innings in 
the opener to win his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to talk it over. "We'll decide later tonight whether to keep him 
around, " Manager Jim Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous, I wasn't sure if I would throw the first pitch on the bounce 
or to the backstop, " York said. "I think I threw a strike and after that I was 
all right. I guess the nervousness flattened out my curve. I threw only about 
two good ones all night, but we won." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates came from behind to win the second game on a tiebreaking single in 
the eighth inning by Jay Bell, who earlier hit one of the Pirates' three home 
runs. Bobby Bonilla, who hit one in the first game, and Jeff King also homered. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds had a single and stole two bases in the first game to become the 
first Pirate to hit 20 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 3, New York 2 -- Matt Williams hit a three-run homer and Steve 
Bedrosian earned his first save since May 30 in this game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Mets two games behind the Pirates. The Giants, who ended a 
five-game losing streak, moved to within 7 1/2 games of the division-leading 
Reds in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' runs off winner Scott Garrelts came on a pinch two-run homer by Tom 
O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Atlanta 0 -- Mike Harkey had an extra reason for getting the Braves 
out quickly at Chicago. He and some teammates were going to an M.C. Hammer 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"The other guys were putting pressure on me to get it over," Harkey said. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey (12-5) responded with a three-hitter, struck out six and walked none. He 
needed slightly more than two hours to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Shawon Dunston hit two home runs and drove in four runs and Mark Grace also 
homered for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, San Diego 1 -- Dale Murphy hit his first home run for the 
Phillies at San Diego and Jose DeJesus (4-4) pitched a six-hitter to beat the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The long drive into the left field seats was Murphy's 18th homer of the season 
and the 27th of his career at Jack Murphy Stadium, the most by a visiting 
player. DAN HAFNER

Pedro Guerrero of the St. Louis Cardinals was suspended for one game by Bill 
White, National League president, Friday for his involvement in a fight during 
Thursday night's game against the Houston Astros in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero and Houston pitcher Danny Darwin were fined an undisclosed amount for 
their part in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiscriminate on-field fighting has got to stop," White said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Darwin, Guerrero and Astro Manager Art Howe were ejected by first-base umpire 
Bob Davidson after Guerrero and Darwin fought in the top of the seventh inning. 
Darwin and Guerrero shouted at each other after Darwin threw inside to Guerrero 
in the sixth inning. Guerrero punched Darwin in the face at first base after 
Darwin got an infield hit in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches cleared but there were no other incidents, although Darwin and 
Guerrero shouted at each other outside the teams' locker rooms. After the game, 
several police officers were called to the clubhouse area as a precautionary 
measure.

MCANALLY IS HOPING SILVER ENDING CAN FOLLOW SAME PATH AS HAWKSTER 
</P>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was last year that another son of Silver Hawk skipped his way through the 
schedule without a mistake. First the Del Mar Derby, followed by the 
Secretariat at Arlington Park, then the Oak Tree Invitational at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
And it was in the Invitational that Hawkster turned in one of the sport's most 
dazzling performances on turf with a spectacular, wire-to-wire victory. A 
mediocrity on the main track, Hawkster was exceptional on the green. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally is hoping that Silver Ending can emulate his now-retired older 
brother, starting Sunday when the bargain yearling takes on nine other 
3-year-olds in the $300,000 Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Far more accomplished on the dirt than Hawkster, Silver Ending has every right 
to move up on the turf. Besides his sire, Copperhead, his dam, is also by 
Hawaii, so he's bred for the surface on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
In his one previous turf try, the Kentucky-bred, owned by Angelo Costanza and 
McAnally's wife, Debbie, won an allowance race by two lengths Nov. 15 at 
Hollywood Park. Although the competition wasn't much, Silver Ending was 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has gone on to earn well over $600,000, including victories in 
the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows and the Arkansas Derby. Most recently, 
Silver Ending was second, beaten by a neck, by Jovial in the Swaps on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he'll take on a Derby field that includes the Bruce Jackson duo of Aksar 
and In Excess; stablemate Tight Spot, who won the recent La Jolla Handicap; 
Mehmetori; Chicago import Super Abound, and Itsallgreektome. 
</P>
<P>
"He's coming up to the race as good as can be expected," McAnally said. "He 
worked seven furlongs in 1:24 1/5 and galloped out a mile in 1:37 2/5 last 
week. Eddie (Delahoussaye) said he felt good and strong. He went 1:03 4/5 on 
the turf Thursday and he just skipped over it. His ears were up all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"He's bred on both sides for the turf and hopefully, he'll live up to it. He's 
got the right kind of action. If all goes well, we'll try to follow the same 
pattern as Hawkster." 
</P>
<P>
Tight Spot, a son of His Majesty who will race coupled with Silver Ending, is 
unbeaten in two tries on the turf. He went wire-to-wire in the Star Dust at 
Hollywood Park in late June, then held off Itsallgreektome to win the La Jolla 
by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
With Delahoussaye, whom McAnally allowed to choose his Derby mount, opting for 
Silver Ending, Laffit Pincay will ride Tight Spot. "He might have a little 
trouble getting the extra distance (the Derby is 1 1/8 miles, a sixteenth 
longer than the La Jolla)," McAnally said. "But the turf seems to be playing a 
little more for speed now. 
</P>
<P>
"Laffit worked Tight Spot the other day, and he said he felt strong. I'll just 
tell him to try and slow the pace down as much as he can. There is some concern 
about him coming back (in two weeks), but he's a strong colt and a good doer 
who can take a little more punishment than some of the others." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Jovial is sitting this one out in favor of next month's Molson 
Export Challenge, Jackson is well-represented with two other foreigners, Aksar 
and In Excess. 
</P>
<P>
Both were second in their American debuts, the former in an allowance race, the 
latter in the first division of the Oceanside, where he was a head back of 
Mehmetori. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens rode both colts, and although he was named on Aksar, he has the 
option of switching to In Excess if he chooses. However, America's leading 
jockey said he's "90% certain" he will stay where he is. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very hard to separate," he said. "I think the two are of equal 
caliber, but I think Aksar's style will fit this race a little better. He's 
easy to place and he's got an unbelievable finish. At this point, I think both 
colts have the credentials to possibly develop into better horses than Jovial." 
</P>
<P>
This is quite a mouthful, considering that Jovial has won three of his four 
starts in this country, including the Cinema Handicap and the Swaps Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens added: "All three are built the same, carry themselves alike and are 
willing to do whatever you want them to do. I don't think any of them have come 
close to peaking yet. All three have lots of room for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Brown Bess will head a field of nine in the $271,500 Ramona 
Handicap today. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Eclipse Award winner as the nation's top female grass performer has 
found things a bit tougher as an 8-year-old, winning only one of four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disappointed with her races this year," trainer Chuck Jenda said. 
"She's a champion who's paying the price of a sensational year by carrying a 
lot of weight this season. Just look at the Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
"She carried 117 pounds when she won last year and now she has 122. She also 
picked up weight from last year in the Yerba Buena and Golden Gate Handicap." 
</P>
<P>
Jenda also thinks the shorter distance -- the Ramona is 1 1/8 miles and her 
last two races have been 1 3/8 miles -- will help Brown Bess, who, as usual, 
will be ridden by Jack Kaenel. 
</P>
<P>
The other Ramona contestants are Nikishka, Reluctant Guest (who had two stakes 
victories at Hollywood Park), Run to Jenny, Stylish Star, Daring Doone (second 
in this race last year), Rosadora, Double Wedge and Jabalina Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
All starters in the Del Mar Derby will carry 122 pounds. . . . The co-feature 
Sunday is the $107,125 Rancho Bernardo Breeders' Cup Handicap at 6 1/2 furlongs 
on the dirt. Trainer Wayne Lukas, who has won the race three of the last four 
years and five of the previous eight, will send out Saratoga Chill, San Rama 
and Plume Poppy. . . . The rest of the field includes Jig's Jove, Down Again, 
Sexy Slew, Hot Novel, Warning Zone, Plume Poppy and Tasteful T.V.

Chris McCarron, who worked three horses again Friday morning, said he will be 
back in action next Friday, less than three months after breaking his legs and 
an arm in a Hollywood Park spill. . . . Apprentice Vann Belvoir, who was hurt 
in a spill Thursday morning, will return Wednesday. "The doctor told him to 
take four or five days off," said agent Scotty McClellan. "He has a little 
soreness in his back from a compressed vertebra and had 10 stitches inside his 
lower lip."

DOW ENDS DOWN 36.64 AFTER LATE RALLY TRIMS 63-POINT MIDDAY LOSS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A late rally wasn't enough to save the anxious stock market Friday from a loss 
that dropped the Dow Jones industrial index 36.64 points to 2,644.80. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow, off as much as 63 points in the early afternoon, closed out the week 
with a loss of 71.78 points, or 2.6%. The decline was the market's 
sixth-consecutive weekly drop and left the Dow at its lowest point since March 
1. 
</P>
<P>
The encouraging news that the U.S. trade deficit had fallen 35% in June had 
little effect on the slide, which was again driven by worries about the 
Mideast, signs of inflation and impending recession. Traders said the late 
rally, which began after 2 p.m., came largely from the close-out of August 
contracts for stock-index futures and options, and stock purchases to make up 
for borrowed, or short, stock positions. 
</P>
<P>
Volume rose to a moderately heavy 212.6 million shares, from Thursday's 138.9 
million, as money managers adjusted their portfolios so they wouldn't be 
blindsided by bad news over the weekend. It was the first time since the 
session of Aug. 7 that the Big Board trading volume exceeded 200 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, there was threatening news from the Middle East and people got 
worried; today, there was no news and the lack of it worried everyone," said 
Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Among broader market indexes, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 
4.56 to 327.83, or 1.4%, the same percentage drop as the Dow. The NASDAQ 
over-the-counter composite gave up 8.78 to 393.49, or 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
On the Big Board, declining stocks routed advancing issues by a margin of 1,315 
to 300. 
</P>
<P>
In other major markets: 
</P>
<P>
Oil again surged. Contracts of the benchmark crude for September delivery 
soared $1.27 to $28.63 in New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and interest rates inched up but did not show the sharp climbs of previous 
sessions when oil rocketed. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was down in New York trading against all major currencies except the 
Japanese yen. The dollar was quoted at an all-time low of 1.550 German marks, 
compared to 1.552 on Thursday, and 147.60 yen, compared to 147.25 yen on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas stock markets started the decline. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index dropped 
762.72, or 2.8%, to 26,786.72; London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 
100-share index lost 45.2 points, or about 2%, to 2176.9. Shares in Milan, 
Italy, were down 4%, and Paris and Frankfurt, West Germany, hit new 1990 lows. 
Frankfurt's DAX share index lost 61.54, or 3.6%, to close at 1,665.88. 
</P>
<P>
Most markets have at least some optimistic analysts, but Friday they may have 
been on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"We see ever further downside potential over the next weeks, and we may even go 
to a bear market, which we define as a 20% decline from the peak," said Louise 
Yamada, vice president and technical analyst for the Smith Barney, Harris Upham 
brokerage in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In her view, the market might find its next stabilizing point at between 2,500 
and 2,550 on the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Conlon, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities International, said 
some investors have been pinning hopes on next week's meeting of the Federal 
Reserve Bank's Open Market Committee, at which the central bank officials are 
expected to take up whether to ease credit. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, with the recent signs of inflation, even if the Fed did move, it 
would probably be only to drop rates one-quarter percentage point. "That 
wouldn't be nearly enough to do what you'd want," Conlon said. 
</P>
<P>
The week left the Dow some 354.95 points, or 11.8%, below the all-time high of 
2,999.95 it posted July 17. But the Dow remains 101.56 points above its 1990 
closing low, which came Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Once again, many of the worst-hit stocks were the supposedly 
recession-resistant stocks that investors flocked to in recent weeks. Coca-Cola 
fell 1 1/8 to 42, Pepsico lost 2 to 73 1/4, Anheuser-Busch tumbled 1 3/4 to 38 
7/8, General Mills dropped 2 to 85 and Heinz lost 1 5/8 to 32 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Industrial stocks falling significantly on recession worries included Deere, 
down 3 3/8 to 57 1/4; Caterpillar, off 1 3/8 to 44 5/8, and Fluor, off 2 1/4 to 
38 3/8. Boeing plunged 2 1/8 to 48 1/2 on concerns about future plane orders, 
given the airline industry slump. 
</P>
<P>
* Many high-tech stocks were bludgeoned. Conner Peripherals dropped 2 to 21 
1/4, Apple slumped 2 to 36 1/2, AST Research fell 1 to 18 7/8, Western Digital 
lost 3/4 to 10 1/8 and IBM gave up 2 3/8 to 101 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks continued to dominate the short winners' list. Arco jumped 2 1/2 
to 137 1/2, Unocal gained 1 1/8 to 33 7/8, Chevron rose 1 1/8 to 78 5/8 and 
Royal Dutch added 1 3/8 to 84 3/4. Gold stocks, meanwhile, were mostly lower on 
profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
* Some beaten-down S&amp;L stocks managed to rise. Ahmanson rose 1/4 to 17 1/8 
and Downey added 1/4 to 14. But California bank stocks continued to slide. 
Imperial Bancorp fell 1 1/2 to 13 1/2, Wells Fargo tumbled 2 1/8 to 57 1/2 and 
First Interstate lost 1 7/8 to 29 3/8.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan executive Thomas Spiegel should learn more 
on Monday about what financial restrictions he will be under while awaiting a 
hearing on charges that he wasted the thrift's money. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel's lawyers and thrift regulators will meet then with U.S. District Judge 
Stephen V. Wilson to work out a solution to the continuing legal dispute, 
Dennis M. Perluss, one of Spiegel's lawyers, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision want Spiegel to put $19 
million into escrow to cover money that they maintain he squandered, plus an 
additional $2 million for potential losses on condominiums Columbia is trying 
to sell.

CAPITAL PLAN DENIAL ANGERS FARWEST CHIEF; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: REGULATORS REJECTED THE AILING THRIFT'S PROPOSAL TO ADD ASSETS FROM 
SUBSIDIARIES. THE TURNDOWN MAY PLACE IT ON THE VERGE OF INSOLVENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of struggling FarWest Savings strongly objected Friday to federal 
regulators' rejection of the thrift's capital plan, contending that the 
regulators made a serious error in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators' action could deprive the Newport Beach-based thrift of $60 
million in capital and place it on the verge of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest President Charles Green said regulators erred in blocking the firm's 
proposal to liquidate a subsidiary carrying its junk bonds and equity real 
estate holdings and fold those assets into the institution. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would allow the thrift to maintain its current capital base without 
having to replace the $60 million. But regulators with the Office of Thrift 
Supervision and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in San Francisco vetoed the 
proposal. The regulators declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said rejection of FarWest's plan -- filed with authorities 
last December -- appears to be an effort by regulators to force a cash infusion 
into the S&amp;L by FarWest's majority owners, the wealthy Belzberg brothers of 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable industry source said FarWest's plan, although submitted nearly 
eight months ago, wasn't ruled on until after a July cutoff date became 
effective for excluding certain subsidiary assets from a thrift's capital base. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected plan, which FarWest is appealing to regulators in Washington, 
promised to reduce the S&amp;L's assets to about $2.7 billion. It also called 
for FarWest to sell off its huge portfolio of risky high-yield junk bonds and 
bolster capital with a stock offering to shareholders of its parent, FarWest 
Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But a key ingredient in the plan called for FarWest to liquidate the subsidiary 
holding its junk bonds and other assets, including direct real estate 
investments. FarWest would then absorb those assets. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's thrift bailout law prohibits S&amp;Ls from acquiring additional 
junk bonds or direct real estate investments. It also requires institutions 
already holding such assets to divest them by 1994. And, in a provision that 
took effect last month, the bailout law also requires S&amp;Ls to set aside 
reserves equal to 10% of a subsidiary's prohibited assets. 
</P>
<P>
Because FarWest's subsidiary holds about $600 million worth of junk bonds and 
other prohibited assets, the S&amp;L will be required to set up a $60-million 
reserve if its appeal fails. And that would reduce its current capital level of 
$37.7 million to negative $23 million, driving it into insolvency.

BOND PRICES MIXED AS MARKET CALMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices finished mixed Friday, stabilizing after a selloff on Thursday. The 
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield inched up to 8.93% from 8.92% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields finished the week at their highest levels in three months, and up from 
8.79% a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was quiet Friday in the absence of fresh developments in the Persian 
Gulf standoff between Iraq and a multinational force led by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But some dealers capitalized on the low prices to buy, said Bruce R. Lakefield, 
executive vice president with Shearson Lehman Government Securities. Traders 
also bought bonds to cover short positions. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans, 
was quoted at 7.75%, down from 8.125% on Thursday.

Dollar Falls Again onEconomic Gloom 
</P>
<P>
The dollar sank to another all-time low Friday against the German mark and fell 
against most other currencies, reflecting continuing pessimism about the state 
of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to a record low close of 1.5485 German marks in Europe from 
1.5630 late Thursday. Its previous low close in Europe was 1.560 marks 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.550 marks, a new low for that market. Its 
previous low close in New York was 1.552 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
For the week, the dollar sank 6.7% against the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar edged up to 147.60 from 147.25 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late rates Thursday: 1.2820 
Swiss francs, down from 1.2915; 5.1975 French francs, down from 5.2220; 
1,142.25 Italian lire, down from 1,143.25, and 1.14365 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.14815.

Gold Mixed in U.S. After Foreign Rally 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed in New York, after rising overseas. On the Commodity 
Exchange, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents to $409.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Silver for current delivery rose 1.1 cents to $5.18 an ounce on the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
The metals' muted gains were in sharp contrast to another leap in the price of 
oil, up $1.27 to $28.63 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate for September 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, analysts predicted a sharp drop in cattle futures prices after a 
government report showed that far more cattle were placed on feedlots last 
month than the market had expected. 
</P>
<P>
An anticipated drop of at least a penny a pound would extend losses posted on 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of the report. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets Friday, pork futures were mixed, oil and gasoline 
futures skyrocketed, precious metals rose, and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle futures settled .20 to .57 cents lower in Chicago, with the 
contract for delivery in August at 77.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 
unchanged to .67 cents lower, with August at 89.65 cents a pound; live hogs 
were unchanged to .35 cents lower, with August at 57.52 cents a pound, and 
frozen pork bellies were .83 cents lower to 1.17 cents higher, with August at 
48.12 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released after the close of trading, the Agriculture Department 
said 7 million cattle were on U.S. feedlots Aug. 1 -- 4% more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA said July feedlot placements were 18% higher than a year ago, while 
July marketings off feedlots rose 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were surprised by the placements figure, which compared with 
expectations of a 6% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Corn and soybean futures rose but wheat ended lower on the Chicago Board of 
Trade after a day of choppy trading in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand 
developments.

CATEGORY WINNERS AN OFFBEAT CULTURAL MESH

In the first round of competition in the 1990 Nikkodo International Karaoke 
Contest, the winners in the "Anglo-American" singing category were two young 
black show-biz hopefuls and a Japanese-American sushi chef belting out the 
Motown sound. 
</P>
<P>
The offbeat blend of cultures apparent Wednesday night at West Los Angeles' 
Budhokan restaurant was just what organizers of the Nikkodo Karaoke contest are 
hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
A fund-raiser for September's Los Angeles Festival, the Karaoke singing 
competition invites seven different ethnic communities in Los Angeles -- 
Anglo-American, African-American, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Hispanic and 
Korean -- to select two contestants each to a final competition, in which one 
lucky winner will win $2,000, a trip for two to Japan and Hong Kong and 
recording contract with the Japanese branch of Polydor Records, a division of 
Polygram. 
</P>
<P>
The contest represents a local effort to support the festival's 17-day 
multicultural blitz of artists representing 21 countries of Asia, Latin America 
and the Pacific. Karaoke (pronounced Kara-OK) is a form of amateur 
entertainment developed in Japan and gaining popularity here, in which 
participants sing along with taped background music. 
</P>
<P>
In the preliminaries, entrants may sing any song in any language, whether it be 
a traditional Mexican folk song, a Top 40 hit in English or "My Way" in 
Cantonese. In the final competition, to be held Sept. 30 at Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium, contestants must limit themselves to songs available on Nikkodo 
software in eight languages: English, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Chinese, 
Taiwanese, Cantonese, Spanish and Thai. 
</P>
<P>
While festival and contest organizers hope the Karaoke contest brings L.A.'s 
ethnic groups together, others involved believe that dividing the contest into 
ethnic categories could raise more complex issues of race, ethnicity, language, 
and culture than the festival itself. 
</P>
<P>
Festival director Peter Sellars and Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo, who 
dreamed up the contest -- believe issuing special invitations to each ethnic 
group makes everyone feel more welcome. And singers can join any preliminary 
contest regardless of his or her own race -- provided he or she doesn't change 
groups midway. "I think that is what's great -- it all comes together," Sellars 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars does not see any special problems raised by contestants having to 
affiliate with an ethnic group. "These are the choices people make every day of 
their lives. At this moment in history, there is no way around it," Sellars 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I see this (the Los Angeles Festival) as a 10-year project," 
Sellars continued. "It'll be interesting to watch the labels fall away. At the 
first party, maybe you have to wear name tags -- but maybe as we get to know 
each other better, the tags won't be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Woo originally thought of the contest as a way to raise money in the Chinese 
community, where karaoke is already popular. Later, it was decided to expand 
the idea to include all groups. Woo said individual contests make sense for 
immigrant groups, who might feel less inhibited singing in their own languages 
with judges familiar with their native music. "Bringing them all together -- 
that's what the final competition is all about," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the open invitation to sing with any group, others believe that 
putting ethnic labels on the preliminary contest could cause more problems than 
it solves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it can create controversy, because the ethnic groups already have 
their own controversies," said Florinda Mintz, an Argentinian immigrant and 
curator of the festival's "La Terra Nova" Pacific Poetry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the Hispanic group, you have the Chicanos, you have the 
Mexican-Americans, then you have the South and Central Americans -- the 
communities themselves are divided. Some don't want to be called Hispanics; 
they want to be called Latinos. I know the Asian community is very divided too. 
There are the Japanese who are born here, and the Japanese from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter who you are, you don't want to be classified. I basically feel 
uncomfortable that we have to be asking who we are again. I believe the 
intentions behind all of this are very good, but -- I don't know. I am afraid." 
</P>
<P>
David Harnish, a teaching fellow at UCLA's ethnomusicology department who 
worked on the festival, said many Los Angeles residents either fit into one of 
the ethnic categories, or several. I don't think there is any doubt that some 
people would be offended by it," he said. "They tried to open it up just to be 
fair, but it's very obvious they didn't think through all the potential 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People who identify with these seven groups and feel confident about 
representing those groups might feel encouraged to attend and participate. But 
if they don't -- and the bulk of the people would not, or could not -- they 
would not understand the reason why the event is being planned at all." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese businessman Raymond Chang, an organizer of the Chinese contest, said 
he's not quite comfortable with the notion that a non-Chinese competitor might 
enter that contest -- and win. Although he said the group would never forbid 
anyone to participate, he has encouraged competitors of other ethnic 
backgrounds to contact their own group. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, we wanted to do a pure Chinese group. If they have any 
Chinese blood, they qualify," Chang said. "We (Chinese organizers) talked about 
how we would handle a situation like this, and decided we would explain that 
there are seven groups going on right now. I say, why don't you join the 
Hispanic group, and we'll see you at the finals? 
</P>
<P>
"We ran into the same problem when we were doing the Miss Chinese America 
pageant. If (a non-Chinese) won, she would have to represent that title without 
any Chinese blood." 
</P>
<P>
David Lee, executive producer of the contest and brother of the late martial 
arts hero Bruce Lee, disagreed. "So an Anglo-American comes out a winner in the 
Chinese community. So what?" he said. "We just feel that there shouldn't be any 
barriers between any cultures." Larry Covin, organizer of the African-American 
competition -- which so far has the most participants -- agreed with Lee. "I 
would welcome (any winner), I would applaud them all the way. I'm not looking 
for a black to win, I'm looking for everyone to win. I have all colors in my 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the attitude most participants are taking: The contest system 
may not be perfect for the United Nations, but for the purposes of this 
competition, it works. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not perfect, but it's a place to start," said Gioia Siciliano, organizer 
of the Anglo contest at Budhokan. Despite the official designation 'Anglo,' she 
prefers to call her contest simply "American." "'Anglo' seems to have too much 
of an ethnic connotation," she said. "This way, people can choose: they can 
compete as what they came from, or what they are now." 
</P>
<P>
David Rose, an Anglo-American who competed in a recent Asian American Star 
Search competition, was torn about whether to enter the Chinese contest or an 
Anglo contest. He finally chose an Anglo contest, because "I'd rather beat a 
white person than an Asian; I don't want to knock anyone out." He also said his 
heavy-metal song choice might better be classified as "Anglo" music: "If I were 
singing a Cantonese song, I'd join the Chinese competition," he said.

FACES . . . : THE SOFTER SIDE OF ANNE DESALVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor Anne DeSalvo. She seems like such a nice person, but you wouldn't know it 
from her films. 
</P>
<P>
She has an impressive list of credits and has received great notices for her 
crack comedic performances in such movies as "Arthur," "Stardust Memories" and 
"My Favorite Year." But she's always playing villains, tough cookies, sarcastic 
hookers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm usually the shrew," sighs DeSalvo. "I'm usually very much in control." 
</P>
<P>
That is, until now. DeSalvo finally has the opportunity to show some sympathy 
in the new Touchstone comedy "Taking Care of 
</P>
<P>
Business." She plays Debbie, the good-hearted, vulnerable friend of a 
businessman (Charles Grodin) who comes to his rescue after he loses his Filofax 
filled with cash, credit cards and house keys. Though he is happily married, 
Debbie thinks he loves her. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to see me wounded," says DeSalvo. "You get to see me pierced. People 
have been referring to my performance as 'adorable.' I have never been called 
adorable in my profession." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Philadelphia, DeSalvo has spent most of her career living in New York. 
Two years ago, she moved to Los Angeles. "I was ready to do television," she 
explains. "Five years ago, if you became a TV star, that's all you became. Now 
it does enhance your career." In November, she's scheduled to start work on the 
ABC comedy series "Honor Bound." 
</P>
<P>
DeSalvo doesn't miss the Big Apple. "I think New York is a time in your life, 
instead of a place in your life," she says. "I really like living here. You 
don't have to work so hard at everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, she receives a letter from the ultimate New Yorker, Woody Allen, 
with whom she worked in "Stardust Memories." 
</P>
<P>
"That guy is, like, the best," DeSalvo says. "When I met him we laughed for 20 
minutes. I wrote him recently about 'New York Stories.' I didn't expect to hear 
from him and he writes me back within five days. That says a lot about 
somebody." SUSAN KING

L.A. LATINOS WATCH MORE TV, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latinos in Los Angeles are watching considerably more television than the 
general population, according to a new study by the A. C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on people meters in 200 Latino households throughout Southern 
California, was designed as a pilot for Nielsen's new 800-household National 
Hispanic Television Service, which the firm plans to launch early next year to 
measure the viewing habits of Latino households throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The service will be independent of the better-known 4,000-household Nielsen 
service that reports overall national TV ratings. (About 8% of the national 
sample is Latino.) 
</P>
<P>
According to the new Nielsen study, conducted between June 14 and July 11, 61% 
of Latino households had televisions on during the 8 to 11 p.m., 
Monday-through-Sunday prime-time period, compared to 54% for the general 
population. Daytime television was watched by 44.5% of Latino households 
compared to 31.3% for the Los Angeles market. In addition, the study showed 71% 
of Latino households own a VCR, and 29.6% subscribe to cable television. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen estimates that there are 1,125,910 Latino households with television in 
the Los Angeles area. The company puts the national Latino figure at 6,108,450.

POP BEAT / DISCO: SUDDENLY, THE 'OLD' SOUND ONCE AGAIN IS NEW; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: PRICES ARE UP ON THOSE OLD RECORDINGS, ALBUMS HAVE BEEN RE-RELEASED ON 
CD AND DISCO CLUBS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK. CLEARLY, IT'S NOSTALGIA TIME. 
</P>

<P>
Disco music crept into a certain kind of intellectual respectability only 
recently. It was a trend too evil to die, like the tons of rotting polyester 
shirts that will inevitably make their way onto all the hippest torsos. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, in used-record stores all over the country, old Rose Royce LPs are 
moved from the 23-cent bins to the $3-and-up sections. KC &amp; the Sunshine 
Band makes a triumphal New York appearance. A disco in Manchester, England, 
becomes the most famous club in the world. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the inevitable nostalgia for the good days -- especially the 
glamorous Andy-Bianca-Halston Studio 54 thing so intricately recounted in the 
Warhol tell-alls. It was America's last, pre-AIDS fling with drugs, fashion and 
promiscuous sex. The music's getting re-released on CD now, too, notably Rhino 
Records' two-volume salute, "The Disco Years." 
</P>
<P>
Was disco as bad as we thought? 
</P>
<P>
The revisionist theory of disco can be divided into several parts: 
</P>
<P>
* Disco was a music dominated by blacks and gays. Therefore, the late-'70s 
anti-disco thing was really just a front for racism and homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
* Disco was the first mainstream pop movement to put women, who sang lead on 
almost every record, in charge of their own sexuality. Guys who didn't like 
disco were really just threatened by that. 
</P>
<P>
* In the wake of punk's implosion, the most advanced pop music comes from those 
artists -- Prince, the Pet Shop Boys, Madonna, Stone Roses -- who ironically 
celebrate music as commodity, within the context of disco. Dance music -- disco 
-- has never been more popular. 
</P>
<P>
* Hip-hop, the most important pop form today, is seen as rising from disco. In 
fact, early recorded rap was disco, simple rhyming over recreated disco songs 
like Chic's "Good Times" and Cheryl Lynn's "Got to Be Real." 
</P>
<P>
* House music, which is basically latter-day disco made with cheaper equipment, 
is so mechanical it makes Sylvester seem funky as James Brown. 
</P>
<P>
* Disco's big in the U.K., which means it's gotta be hip. 
</P>
<P>
So given 15 years to exorcise the taints of white suits, poppers, platform 
shoes and spinning disco balls, we should be able to experience disco as pure 
music. . . . Nope, still not enough time. But let's try. 
</P>
<P>
Rhino's disco compilations, curated by discophile Ken Barnes, form an 
uber-K-Tel spectacular, each song neatly nestling into the space in the 
synapses it had already seared out a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the words "Disco Inferno" make you flinch, it's not necessary to actually 
listen to "The Disco Years" to absorb the full impact -- a scan of the titles 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
The collection is a basic historical survey -- from Van McCoy's 1975 
instrumental hit "The Hustle," considered the first disco record, to Indeep's 
'82 classic "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life," an odd, half-rap, half-dance 
record that might signal disco's resubmergence into the American mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
It includes two-thirds of the most popular disco songs: the Village People's 
"YMCA," Anita Ward's "Ring My Bell" and A Taste of Honey's "Boogie Oogie 
Oogie." And also a good chunk of the best: Shirley &amp; Company's awesomely 
funky "Shame, Shame, Shame," and Lipps Inc.'s eternal "Funkytown." 
</P>
<P>
Some important music is missing -- including hits by Donna Summer, the Bee Gees 
and the fabulous Taana ("Heartbeat") Gardner -- because Rhino wasn't able to 
secure the rights to the recordings. This is still all the disco record anybody 
needs to own. 
</P>
<P>
The big surprise here, at least for those of us who haven't listened to a lot 
of this recently, is the music's variety, which is at least as great as that 
found in any random hour of, say, Power 106. 
</P>
<P>
People used to say that all disco was canned, and back then it sounded that 
way. But the vocals, for one thing, sound more natural, less processed than 
anything by the likes of Madonna or Paula Abdul, and many of the vocalists have 
glorious voices, especially Shirley Goodman and Thelma Houston. (Even where 
they can't sing, as with porn-star/novelty-act Andrea True, the personality 
comes through.) 
</P>
<P>
A decade of listening to rap-music beat-boxes has more or less desensitized our 
ears to disco's monotonous beat -- though much of it is very monotonous indeed 
-- and KC &amp; the Sunshine Band's intricate, interlocking funk grooves create 
a rhythmic fabric dense as an A-side produced by Quincy Jones. The cliches, the 
swirling strings and hand claps and synthesizer woo-woos are easier to take 
than they were then. 
</P>
<P>
But even divorced from their obnoxious social context, the best disco songs are 
nothing more than hollow displays of pop craft, technique without substance. If 
disco has any importance today, it's as a roots music. Call "Boogie Oogie 
Oogie" the "Be Bop a Lula" of modern R&amp;B.

MASS BAPTISM FILLS SURF LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY CHABOT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of people seeking spiritual purification walked into the sea Friday 
evening in what local church officials said was the largest baptism in memory. 
</P>
<P>
The converts entered the surging surf, some singly, others holding hands with 
spouses and children, and were greeted by pastors who asked them if they were 
ready to accept Jesus Christ in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
As the converts nodded or whispered their affirmation, they were briefly 
submerged in the water. Most surfaced smiling. Others hugged their pastor or 
began to weep. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel loved," said Mark Contreras, 27, who came to the baptism with his 
girlfriend and two young daughters from Riverside. "It's just a feeling in your 
heart. I can't explain it, but you know it." 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Reyna, a 31-year-old dental assistant from El Monte, said she accepted 
Jesus Christ in November. "I was waiting for this (baptism) for a long time," 
she said. "Now I won't feel empty anymore. Now I feel like I have a personal 
relationship with Jesus. It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
The mass baptism culminated the weeklong Summer Harvest Crusade at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa -- five nights of speeches and Christian rock 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Crusade officials had expected more than 5,000 to show up for the baptisms, 
which were to be held in the waters off Pirate's Cove. But so many appeared 
that the ceremony was moved to a more open section of Corona del Mar State 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
An hour after the ceremonies began at 7 p.m., thousands of people still waited 
their turn on the shore or were stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Steele, a spokesman for the crusade, said he had no way of estimating how 
many people actually arrived to be baptized. 
</P>
<P>
The crusade was sponsored by more than 100 Southern California churches, 
including Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, which played a large part in the 
original Jesus movement of the early 1970s. In fact, many of the spectators 
were grown-up members of the 1970s movement, attending the crusade with their 
families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the same conditions prevail now which prevailed at the time of the 
original movement," including drug use and rebellious attitudes, Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
"We, as Christians, depend on the Holy Spirit to move people, and He has moved 
people in a big way," said Jack Acuff, a member of a Christian advertising 
agency in Orange asked to promote the crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who watched the event had already been baptized. They said they 
just wanted to be there to share the joy with people who would become like 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a blessing for me to see others accept the faith," said Lisa Foley, 32, 
of Lakewood. "The baptism is not how we are saved. It is just a witness to 
others that we have accepted Jesus into our lives.

MEDICINE: ANAHEIM'S DR. CHARLES WESLEY TURNER JR. IS ACCUSED OF GROSS 
NEGLIGENCE AND INCOMPETENCE FOR TIMING A DELIVERY TO BE THE FIRST OF THE 
DECADE, THEN WHISKING THE CHILD ONTO A CHRISTIAN TV SERVICE.

<P>
An Anaheim doctor who whisked a seconds-old infant from a birthing center to 
display her before a cheering television church congregation on New Year's Day 
has been charged with gross negligence and incompetence for allegedly 
endangering the mother and baby. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Jana Tuton filed the complaint on behalf of the Medical Board 
of California against Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. The attorney general's 
office is seeking to suspend or revoke Turner's license. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, in the first seconds of 1990, the mother had not 
yet delivered the placenta and still was under spinal anesthesia when the 
doctor tucked the 6-pound, 12-ounce infant into a Christmas stocking, ran with 
the child out of the medical building, through an outside area about 150 feet 
to Melodyland Church to show her off at a nationally broadcast service as the 
first baby of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no business leaving her in the third stage of labor," Tuton said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Babies, she said, are "fragile creatures in the first few minutes of life. . . 
. You can't properly evaluate the baby when you're racing across the street. If 
(the baby was) in distress, you have no means of dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were added last week to a pending complaint filed in June that 
charges Turner with gross negligence and incompetence in five other 1987 
births. 
</P>
<P>
Turner has said he controlled the birth so that it would occur seconds into the 
New Year by administering anesthesia to the mother and using forceps to remove 
the infant girl at his Covenant Birthing Center in Anaheim. Three months 
earlier, he had told Melodyland's pastor that he could provide a newborn for 
the service, which drew 4,000 people, including a team of Christian 
weightlifters. 
</P>
<P>
Turner did not return phone calls from The Times on Friday. But he said earlier 
that neither the baby nor the mother were at risk and added that he would do 
the same thing again if he had the chance, because it was a thrilling, 
momentous event that harmed no one. 
</P>
<P>
Tuton, however, said Turner posed a risk to both the patient and the baby by 
administering anesthesia 15 minutes before the infant was born. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint also alleges that Turner had been negligent with the mother's 
prenatal care by failing to address the fact that the infant was abnormally 
small. 
</P>
<P>
"His own records indicate she was always too small, and he never did anything," 
Tuton said. "This is a red flag. A doctor is supposed to evaluate through an 
ultrasound and take appropriate measures." 
</P>
<P>
The mother and baby appear to have suffered no ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
Turner has said both parents consented in the delivery room to his taking the 
baby to Melodyland. The mother, Brigitte Elke Palmer, 25, told The Times 
afterward that she "felt a little funny, because he took her and ran off with 
her. . . . But he wanted to have her on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Nurses removed the placenta, and Turner returned with the child after 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said afterward that she fully trusts Turner and "felt perfectly safe." 
</P>
<P>
She said she went along with Turner's idea to time the birth because "it 
sounded fun, an exciting idea." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 64, is a general practitioner at the Lestonnac Clinic in Orange and his 
own Covenant Birthing Center. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced at Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center until 1988, when he was 
suspended from obstetrical practice there. He has been under investigation by 
the Medical Board of California since then. 
</P>
<P>
In the original complaint filed June 27, Turner was charged with negligence 
during five 1987 births at the Santa Ana hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations were that he failed to diagnose growth retardation in a 
developing baby that was born at just 4 pounds, 3 ounces. Also, the complaint 
alleges that he failed to screen a high-risk patient for diabetes; ruptured the 
amniotic membranes prematurely in another birth; failed to diagnose a breech 
presentation until 10 hours into labor, and violated hospital standards for 
failing to alert staff members that a woman was having twins and might need 
emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's medical license was placed on probation for five years in 1984 for 
illegally prescribing drugs. It was reinstated in full in 1989.

HOMELESS: ROBERT ELISEO ABEYTA'S DREAM OF A FRESH START IN CALIFORNIA WAS CUT 
SHORT BY HIS DRINKING. HIS TROUBLES APPARENTLY STEMMED FROM CHILDHOOD AND ENDED 
IN DEATH IN A CARDBOARD BOX.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Robert Eliseo Abeyta's marriage collapsed in Arizona 11 years ago, he 
looked to Southern California to start anew. 
</P>
<P>
But when he resettled in Santa Ana, relatives said, Abeyta failed to find the 
fresh start he was seeking. Forlorn over the separation from his wife and his 
three daughters, who remained in Arizona, relatives said he sank steadily into 
alcoholism and wound up losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Abeyta's body was found behind a Santa Ana grocery store. Police 
said he apparently had been sleeping in a box near a loading platform when he 
was crushed by a delivery truck. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, driven by Fernando Castro, 32, of San Diego, was backing into the 
loading dock of the Santa Ana Food Market in the 1200 block of W. 1st Street 
about 6 a.m. Thursday when it ran over the box covering Abeyta, said Santa Ana 
Police Sgt. Larry Wagstaff. Abeyta, 47, was found dead in the box two hours 
later, Wagstaff said. Police called the death an accident and Castro was not 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and store managers, Abeyta was just another of the many 
transients who crawl into discarded boxes behind the store at night. Guy Lau, 
an assistant store manager, said the transients use the boxes as a cushion 
against the hard cement. 
</P>
<P>
To his family, Abeyta was a tragic example of the dangers of alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so sad," said his sister, Alice Abeyta of Garden Grove. "Robert just 
could never learn to cope with the problems that life issued to us. But he's 
not ever going to suffer anymore. He's not going to be lonely anymore." 
</P>
<P>
According to Alice Abeyta and one of the victim's daughters, Abeyta had had a 
drinking problem for most of his adult life. She said her brother began 
drinking because of a troubled childhood in Santa Fe, N.M. Abeyta's father left 
the family early on, leaving Abeyta, his sister and four other brothers to grow 
up in foster homes, Alice Abeyta said. 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, Abeyta moved with his sister to Phoenix and fell in love with a 
young woman employed at the same hotel where he worked. Their wedding was 
apparently a gala affair, with a reception and dance held at a posh Phoenix 
banquet room. The happiness of the bride and groom on that day 26 years ago 
radiates from a faded photograph kept in a closet box at Alice Abeyta's 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Although her brother was a hard worker and good provider, he continued to 
drink. His wife eventually told him to get out of the house, said Alice Abeyta 
and Abeyta's eldest daughter, Deanna Garcia, 23, of Phoenix. The other two 
daughters, 21 and 19, also live in Phoenix, along with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that amid the turmoil, there were some good times. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of fun together," Garcia said. "He would buy us things. He would 
take us to the park and play. We would play ball and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Abeyta said her brother's wife, who could not be reached for comment 
Friday, told Abeyta to leave and not come back until he had "straightened out 
his life." After he moved to Santa Ana, Alice Abeyta said her brother's wife 
severed all contact between him and the rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times he would say, 'If only I could see my family, things would be 
better,' " Abeyta said. "He was a very lonely person because he lost his 
family. He figured his wife had given up on him altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Valenzuela, a Santa Ana resident who helps homeless people, said she 
first remembers seeing Abeyta out on the street about eight years ago. He was 
homeless, she said, and sleeping outside. Valenzuela, 46, said she put Abeyta 
up in a camper trailer parked in her yard and arranged to get him on welfare 
assistance. He lived in the camper, off and on, until the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela said Abeyta was "a very, very good-hearted man" but was a chronic 
drinker and often disappeared for days at a time while on a drinking binge. 
</P>
<P>
"He would go out and get lost, stay out drinking for days," Valenzuela said. 
"Homeless friends of his would tell me that he was out in the alley and that 
I'd better hurry up and get him or he'd get run over. 
</P>
<P>
"Two policemen came to my house two years ago after they found him halfway in 
the street and halfway on the sidewalk. I told him, 'Robert, don't sleep out 
there in the street. You know that cars can run over you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Abeyta did manage to quit drinking for a 3-year period beginning in 1984, his 
sister said, after "being saved" in a Pentecostal church and attending weekly 
support sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, Alice Abeyta said her brother managed to pull his life back 
together somewhat. He started his own landscaping business, fell in love with 
another woman and played gospel songs with his guitar, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But when the woman ended the relationship about 1987, Abeyta said her brother 
began drinking again. Until his death, she added, Abeyta tried to fight his 
alcoholism, but never was able to go more than a short period without a drink. 
</P>
<P>
"He really tried to stop," she said. "He was reaching out for help." 
</P>
<P>
As down as he was, Alice Abeyta said, her brother had not given up entirely on 
life. Only two weeks ago, she said, he spent the weekend at her place and 
seemed excited about his upcoming birthday on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"He was reminding everyone not to forget his birthday," Alice Abeyta said. "I 
planned a big celebration, and I was going to take him out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Services for Abeyta are awaiting the arrival of his family from Phoenix. In 
addition to the three daughters, he is survived by 10 grandchildren -- and an 
11th is due in two weeks by his daughter Deanna.

CARPENTER TRIAL RECORDING NAMES CAMPBELL, EX-AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A secretly taped conversation played to jurors in a Capitol corruption trial 
portrays the top aide to former state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights) as "famous" for being an aggressive fund-raiser who takes "a cut" of 
potential campaign funds funneled to his boss. 
</P>
<P>
The tape, played in federal court Thursday in the trial of former Orange County 
state Sen. Paul Carpenter, also describes Campbell as being "available" to 
receive a cut of the contribution money in return for a potential vote on a 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The comments about Campbell and his aide, Jerome M. Haleva, were made during an 
August, 1986, Sacramento breakfast meeting between a Carpenter aide and several 
undercover FBI agents investigating corruption in the Statehouse. During the 
restaurant meal, the aide, unaware he was being taped, suggested setting up a 
"one-to-one" meeting with Campbell but warned that Haleva should be avoided 
when making the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't set it up through Haleva because Haleva will want a cut," said Carpenter 
aide John Shahabian, who then started laughing. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, Shahabian came back to the subject of Haleva. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry, I'm not kidding. You'll end up paying Jerry too. He's famous for it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Haleva, now a lobbyist, nor Campbell, now president of the California 
Manufacturers Assn., returned telephone calls to their Sacramento offices 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No money was ever offered to Campbell or his aide, and neither has been charged 
in the FBI undercover probe of corruption in the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, a Democrat and now a member of the State Board of Equalization, is 
charged with four counts of racketeering, attempted extortion and conspiracy. 
An FBI agent posing as an Alabama businessman has testified that intermediary 
Shahabian required a $20,000 campaign contribution for Carpenter's help in 
passing a 1986 bill that would give a $1-million tax break to a phony 
shrimp-importing company. 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian also told the agent that Carpenter would divvy up the $20,000 among 
other legislators to ensure that they voted for the bill. He suggested Campbell 
and Sen. James W. Nielsen (R-Rohnert Park) as likely Republican recipients, and 
promised that everyone involved would know the money was connected to their 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
"They know. They'll know. Everybody'll know. Nobody will say it, but 
everybody'll know. . . ." Shahabian said. "You tell Nielson who's the minority 
leader and Campbell who's sort of, just available and . . . you tell them one 
to one." 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian suggested that Campbell was a good possibility for cooperation 
because he would be leaving the Legislature if his bid for state controller at 
the time was successful. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that he's a force" in the Legislature, Shahabian said, explaining why 
Campbell would be crucial for winning a two-thirds vote needed for the bill in 
the 40-member Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that you peel off . . . Y'know, you got to peel off three or four Reps 
(Republicans) to get a 27 vote on the bill. So he's very peel-offable. He's 
leaving." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Shahabian suggested arranging the Campbell meeting through Haleva, 
whose aggressive style and legislative adroitness earned him the nickname of 
the "41st Senator." 
</P>
<P>
Haleva also worked to raise campaign funds and arrange speaking engagements for 
Campbell, who consistently received the highest amount of legislative speaking 
fees each year. For his work, Haleva has been paid thousands of dollars out of 
Campbell's campaign funds -- payments that continued throughout the year, 
although both men are now in private business, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure forms show that Campbell paid Haleva $21,624 during the last six 
months of 1989. Campbell then left office in December to become president of 
the CMA, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 1989 report, Haleva used the money to pay for hotel rooms, 
meals and a $1,881 bill at a Nordstrom department store. 
</P>
<P>
After Campbell left office, he used campaign money left over in his 
officeholder account to pay Haleva, now a lobbyist, another $69,043 for 
"professional, management and consulting services," the reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of payments are never mentioned in the 1986 conversation, but 
Shahabian joked that Haleva would want "a cut" of any campaign money offered to 
Campbell in exchange for help on the shrimp bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry makes a lot of money. . . . " Shahabian said. 
</P>
<P>
"For collecting?" the operative asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Right," Shahabian replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Does he ask, or does he what? Literally asks, what?" the operative inquired. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," Shahabian answered. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discussion, Campbell, Haleva and Nielson never were approached with 
the bribe offer. Prosecutors say the full $20,000 went to Carpenter, with 
Shahabian receiving a $7,500 cut as a consulting fee through an outside 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva was recently cited by the Fair Political Practices Commission for 
failing to properly disclose the terms of a highly favorable loan he received 
three years ago from a City of Industry company that he later helped in its bid 
to win a lucrative state contract. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the political watchdog agency also forced Haleva and his former 
boss to amend their disclosure forms to show free limousine service they 
received during 1988 from a New Orleans firm that Haleva helped retain another 
contract with the state.

NEW SCHOOL TRUSTEE APPOINTED BY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided Huntington Beach Union High School District Board of Trustees has 
appointed a consultant in early-childhood development to become its new member, 
overriding two trustees' pleas to add a business executive to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Bruce, who also heads up an anti-drug abuse foundation, will join the 
board at its next scheduled meeting, a closed session Sept. 5. She succeeds 
David Warfield, who resigned in June. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Linda Moulton-Patterson and Vice President Charmayne Bohman 
strongly backed Bruce among a field of seven finalists for the post. The board 
majority said they believe she will bring to the board a combination of sound, 
creative educational ideas and business savvy. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, 46, who lives in Fountain Valley and has one child attending school in 
the district, runs her own consulting firm, working through preschools 
countywide to advise parents in the educational development of their young 
children. She is also the former chairwoman of a special education consortium 
and now chairs the No on Drugs Foundation, which raises money for drug-abuse 
prevention programs in Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
As a trustee, Bruce said she plans to carry forward many of the policies the 
board has started, such as the district's management partnership among 
administrators, teachers and board members. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the bottom line is what happens in the classroom," she said during an 
interview Wednesday. "The student-teacher relationship is our foremost concern. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I have no hidden agendas. I think this board is strong, and I like the 
direction this district has taken in the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout candidate interviews the past two weeks, trustees -- faced with an 
ever-tightening budget crunch -- have discussed the need to bring a 
business-oriented member onto a board dominated by education professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Bonnie Castrey and Jerry Sullivan each favored candidates with 
extensive backgrounds in fiscal management. But after Sullivan failed to win 
other trustees' support behind his nominee, he cast the decisive vote to 
appoint Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce said she is confident she can help with the district's fiscal concerns, 
given her background in running a business and interacting with the community. 
She stressed that the district should consider tapping into educational 
foundations and establishing business partnerships to help stretch its 
dwindling funds. 
</P>
<P>
As an appointed member of the board, Bruce's term will expire at the next board 
election, in November, 1991, when she will be eligible to run for a full 
four-year term. She is the district's first appointed member since 1978, when 
Steve Smith and Brian Lake were appointed to fill board vacancies. JOHN PENNER

BOY, 4, DIES AFTER BEING STRUCK BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 4-year-old boy died Friday morning after being struck by a car in Garden 
Grove, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Roberto Valladares died after being hospitalized overnight in the 
pediatric intensive-care unit at UCI Medical Center in Orange, hospital 
spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose was playing in the front yard of his home in the 12000 block of Buaro 
Street at 5:30 p.m. Thursday when he suddenly dashed out into the street, 
Garden Grove Police Lt. Kenneth Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
"The child ran out from between two parked cars," Adair said. "Nobody seems to 
know why the kid ran into the street." 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Brooks, 19, of Garden Grove, could not stop her 1985 Mitsubishi in time 
to avoid the child. Jose suffered massive head injuries and was rushed to the 
hospital. The driver was not cited in the accident, Adair said.

ANTI-GANG GROUP PLANNING CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the southern edge of Anaheim, bordering Stanton and Garden Grove, is a tiny 
neighborhood filled with old single-story, wood-frame houses. The neighborhood 
is home to a decades-old gang, which for years has been part of conflicts 
involving rival gangs from surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
Dannue Mayo watched this longstanding dispute for the past three years and 
decided to do something about it. In something of a one-man effort, Mayo set up 
shop for his program, the Golden Opportunity Youth Assn., inside the Anaheim 
Independencia Community Center in the heart of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In the back room of the center, he is beginning to "break the ice" with 
residents and show youths that in GOYA there an alternative to gang 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
GOYA offers young people the use of weight-training facilities, job workshops, 
counseling about how to prepare for interviews and field trips to learn about 
life outside the barrio. The group plans a carwash today, for example, to raise 
money for a trip to Sea World in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In the month since the program began, about two dozen gang members have become 
regular participants. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to show them another way," said Mayo, a former counselor for the Turning 
Point youth program who works as a shuttle bus driver in the Disneyland area. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Mayo plans to start the county's first education program in which 
young people can learn about civic and state laws that govern their 
neighborhoods. In addition, he hopes to begin college preparation workshops in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The group operates with money from donations and other fund-raising activities. 
The city decided against funding GOYA, saying it duplicates services offered by 
Turning Point. That youth counseling organization hit financial troubles and 
closed last month. 
</P>
<P>
GOYA's carwash today will be held outside the community center on Katella 
Avenue between Brookhurst Street and Magnolia Avenue. LISA MASCARO

On Sunday, the fight against drugs will unfold at Independence Park at 801 W. 
Valencia Drive in Fullerton where a 14-bout amateur boxing show will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
Presented by the Fullerton Community Boxing Gym and the Fullerton Police

Weigh-in is scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. and matches are set to begin at 3 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, 30, a former boxer, operates the gym in addition to his full-time job 
at the Miller Brewing Co. The gym is open Monday through Friday in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Fullerton is a very mixed city," Sanchez said. "There is a lot of money here, 
but there's also some poor areas. Nevertheless, drugs are a problem in all 
segments of the city." 
</P>
<P>
While in the gym, Sanchez said strict training is emphasized to the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Boxing is a very disciplined sport," Sanchez said, adding that anyone under 18 
years old can use the facility for free. "We tell the kids there's no room for 
drugs or alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
About 34 people now use the gym, with ages ranging from 11 to 25. Mike 
Rodrigues, 11 -- who along with Paul Colby, 23, of Anaheim Hills, will be 
representing the Fullerton gym in the matches -- has been boxing since he was 8 
years old. He makes it a point to get to the gym at least five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm a little nervous about the fight," said Rodrigues, who lives in 
Anaheim. "I like to work out at the Fullerton gym. Mario is a good trainer, and 
I think he really cares about the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Weighing in at 83 pounds, Rodrigues said he would like to pursue boxing at a 
professional level one day, and is thankful the gym is there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'd be doing if the gym wasn't there," Rodrigues said. "I 
think it really helps me to stay away from things like drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Mona Dean, spokeswoman for the Fullerton Police Department, said Sanchez has 
really made a difference in how the gym relates to the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems Mario's objective of incorporating the kids is a good move," said 
Dean, who noted that the Police Department had printed up the flyer for the 
boxing matches. The department and Neighborhood Watch, a community group that 
works with police, jointly gave $1,500 and the trophy for the boxing event. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1974, the Fullerton Community Gym has enjoyed some success in 
attracting the area's older boxers, Sanchez said. However, after taking over as 
director nine months ago, Sanchez noticed the lack of boxers under 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the gym should put more emphasis on the young kids who need 
something like this in their life," Sanchez said. "From my experience, boxing 
is a great way to keep a kid occupied and teach self-discipline, teamwork and 
self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping increase youth's role in the gym, Sanchez helped bail 
the complex out of some financial problems by using $900 of his own money. He 
also was able to lease the gym for free from the parks department. 
</P>
<P>
"I eventually want to make the gym completely self-sufficient," Sanchez said. 
"I want the gym to be an important part of some of these kids' lives. Someone 
has to do it, so it might as well be me." ERIK HAMILTON

1,452 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED IN COMBINED RAIDS 
</P>

Authorities scored a victory in the local war on drugs Friday, seizing a large 
stash of cocaine from a Yorba Linda condominium and arresting the alleged 
principals of a $100-million-a-year cocaine ring that supplied drugs to Los 
Angeles and 43 states. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated the street value of the cocaine at more than $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure late Thursday night of 1,452 pounds of cocaine took place at three 
locations in Orange and Los Angeles counties, but most of it was discovered at 
a Yorba Linda condominium, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"These actions, I hope, will do more than just scratch the surface," said one 
federal drug enforcement agent, who asked that his name not be used. "These 
busts are gigantic, but they're becoming more commonplace in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a sad state of affairs, but we're working on it." 
</P>
<P>
The arrests Friday of at least 16 members of an alleged drug-trafficking 
operation centered near Los Angeles International Airport was described by 
police as "significant." 
</P>
<P>
The raids began Thursday night when a swarm of drug officials from Orange and 
Los Angeles counties converged on a pinkish-beige condominium in the 6400 block 
of Pepper Hill Drive in a quiet Yorba Linda neighborhood. Officers said they 
seized 1,320 pounds of cocaine, a 9-millimeter handgun and two luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects identified as Jairo Sarbia Ayala, 37, and Jose Jesus Novoa, 26, were 
arrested at the condo and are being held without bail by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Two more seizures of cocaine totaling 132 pounds were made in Montebello and 
Van Nuys, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At a morning press conference at Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, 
officials refused to answer questions about the events leading up to the 
arrests or the men's suspected role in cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also declined to discuss how the cocaine was transported to Southern 
California and whether it was destined for distribution outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said, however, that there may be more arrests in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Los Angeles police, other agencies involved were the FBI, the 
Santa Ana and Brea police departments, the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
and the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression Program.

SANTA ANA POLICE CHIEF VOWS TO CONTINUE WITH SWEEPS; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: DESPITE QUESTIONS OF LEGALITY, HE DEFENDS THE ROUNDUP OF 64 
HOMELESS MEN AT THE CIVIC CENTER ON WEDNESDAY.

<P>
Despite criticism over the roundup of 64 homeless people at the Civic Center, 
Police Chief Paul M. Walters vowed Friday to continue the sweeps until crime is 
reduced in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have crime, we're going to do this," Walters said. "This is not 
a homeless issue. This is a crime issue." 
</P>
<P>
Walters was responding to criticism from Robert J. Cohen, executive director of 
the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, who warned the police chief that if he 
continues the sweeps, the city will face countless civil-rights lawsuits as 
well as the extra costs of pursuing each case in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is going to find this to be a very costly venture. Santa Ana is going 
to find itself sued over and over again," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Legal Aid Society and other civil- and immigration-rights 
organizations are recruiting attorneys to represent those caught in the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of those arrested have told the Legal Aid Society that they will 
each seek a jury trial to fight the charges and then pursue civil-rights claims 
against the city, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Clouser, an attorney with the Santa Ana-based Poverty Law Center, said 
he will also try to enlist a law firm to establish a coalition of attorneys to 
oversee the cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those in the legal community are embarrassed by the Santa Ana police," 
Clouser said. "For many people, it would be nice not to deal with the homeless. 
But these people's rights have been trampled, and that's completely out of 
line." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, police rounded up the 64 homeless men from the Civic 
Center and transported them to Santa Ana Stadium. There, the men were marked 
with numbers on their arms for identification and then chained to a bench for 
more than six hours. 
</P>
<P>
Each man then received a ticket for one of four infractions: jaywalking, 
urinating in public, public drunkenness or littering. The majority received 
littering citations. Nineteen were later determined to be illegal aliens and 
turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials had been called in advance of the roundup, and the men were bused 
to Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Garcia, 19, said in an interview that he was deported to Mexico even 
though he has temporary U.S. residency. Garcia said he did not have his 
residency card with him at the time of the sweep and was picked up for 
allegedly littering as he was standing outside Santa Ana police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that once he arrived in Tijuana, he recrossed the border and went 
to a San Clemente Border Patrol office, where agents verified his legal status 
and allowed him to return to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Walters defended the roundup, saying that the number of 
crimes reported in the Civic Center area had grown. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 707 police incidents were reported in the Civic Center area from 
January to July. The comparable number this year was 790. In June of 1989, six 
crimes were reported in the Civic Center plaza. This year, 131 incidents were 
reported in June, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking after the safety of 10,000 state, county, federal and city 
employees who work at the Civic Center," Walters said.

HOSPITAL SAYS UCI INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OF ITS DOCTORS FINDS NO MEDI-CAL FRAUD 
</P>

An internal probe of UCI Medical Center doctors suspected of illegally billing 
Medi-Cal for prescribing research drugs to patients has found "no evidence of 
fraud or misconduct," a hospital spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Young, a UCI Medical Center spokesperson, said the investigation found no 
evidence to substantiate charges that doctors illegally billed Medi-Cal for 
research drugs, falsely labeled drugs or kept two sets of medical records to 
hide the practice from Medi-Cal, which does not pay for research. 
</P>
<P>
Research drugs were prescribed to Medi-Cal patients, Young said, but they were 
never charged to the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
Young did not know what effect, if any, the hospital's audit will have on a 
separate investigation of similar charges by the state attorney general's 
bureau of Medi-Cal fraud and patient abuse. But a spokesman in the attorney 
general's office said that despite the hospital's findings, the inquiry into 
alleged Medi-Cal fraud and falsification of records at UCI Medical Center will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"Their results will have no impact at all. We're still going to proceed with 
our preliminary investigation," said Christopher Rodriguez, the attorney 
general's investigator in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints that helped launch the hospital's internal probe were made in 
February by two UCI psychiatrists and an administrator for the psychiatric 
department. Letters written by them, copies of which were obtained by The 
Times, were sent to Dr. William E. Bunney, who later requested the audit, and 
Dr. Donald B. Summers, the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of UCI's 
department of psychiatry and human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The letters indicated that ethical and legal concerns about the alleged 
practices had been raised months earlier. The concern, according to sources, 
was that the practice of administering the research drug Zacopride to patients 
would jeopardize Medi-Cal funding for those patients' treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Yeilding, director of internal audits, was quoted by Young as saying 
they interviewed doctors that prescribed the research drug as part of their 
treatment but that Medi-Cal was never billed for the prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"That was all according to standard procedure," Young said. "(Yeilding) pointed 
out it would be kind of crazy to do something like that because it could 
jeopardize the funding." 
</P>
<P>
The research compounds given to patients allegedly were falsely labeled Haldol, 
an anti-schizophrenic drug that is approved for use by Medi-Cal, sources had 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Haldol is a brand name for the drug haloperidol, a tranquilizer used in the 
treatment of psychotic disorders, severe behavior problems in children, and the 
short-term treatment of hyperactivity in children, according to the Physician's 
Desk Reference on prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But one employee in the psychiatric unit said that last September he noticed an 
unusual drug, Haldol-R, on a patient's chart. When asked, he was told it stood 
for the research drug, Zacopride, and that the hospital staff "had changed the 
name" on the patient's records. 
</P>
<P>
Young said a hospital investigator found that "no one falsely labeled 
anything," and that the hospital's performance had conformed with state 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't two sets of medical records. There was one set of medical 
records and one set of research records but Yeilding said the practice conforms 
with state law," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The detail is not minor, because the inquiries come at a time when the 
financially troubled UCI Medical Center is negotiating a new contract with 
state Medi-Cal authorities. Hospital officials are seeking higher reimbursement 
rates for treating Medi-Cal patients to help stem a nearly $12-million deficit 
the medical center reported for the year ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The internal audit is part of a much larger review now being conducted by the 
hospital, Young said. The larger audit should be completed in two months.

LAO CENTER EMBEZZLEMENT SUSPECT HAS REPAID $19,000, ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While maintaining his innocence, the former executive director of a community 
services agency serving Southeast Asian refugees has paid back $19,000 of the 
$57,000 he is accused of stealing from the organization, his attorney said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a thief," attorney Bruce Bridgman said of his client, Kao Thao, 30, 
who was charged by the state attorney general's office with misappropriating 
public funds, embezzlement and grand theft from the Lao Family Community Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state investigation has centered on the alleged embezzlement by 
Thao, Lao Family Community also has been cited by the Internal Revenue Service 
for non-payment of payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A lien filed in January by the IRS against the agency, headquartered in Garden 
Grove, totals $119,256 and remains unsettled, IRS spokeswoman Judith Golden 
said Friday. Other liens totaling $94,562 were filed and settled in 1988, 
before Thao's employment at the community center. 
</P>
<P>
Lao Family Community acting director Gayle Morrison said the IRS lien is "part 
of our internal investigation we are under right now." 
</P>
<P>
Thao served as the group's national director from December, 1988, until his 
termination in mid-July, a day after the state Department of Education 
completed a financial review of its child care contract with the center. 
</P>
<P>
"The alleged embezzled funds are not derived from that one funding source," 
state Deputy Atty. Gen. James D. Dutton said. He would not elaborate because of 
the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Nhuhao Duong, coordinator for refugee services in Orange County, said the 
county's $10,000 contract with the community organization to provide child 
abuse counseling expired in June and will be reviewed before further funding 
decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the investigation, state education officials also are reviewing the 
current contract with the community agency, which provides a multicultural 
learning program for infants in a Huntington Beach facility. The annual 
contract is for a maximum of $376,262. 
</P>
<P>
The only issue involved in the investigation is the expenditure of funds, not 
the center's job performance, the chief monitor for the education department's 
child development division said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are providing child development services, and we have no concerns about 
the services they provide," said Robert Holcomb, oversight unit manager. "Our 
reviews have been good." 
</P>
<P>
State funding makes up about half of the agency's total annual budget, with 
other public sources making up the difference, said Morrison, who added that 
she hoped the center would not lose its financial sources because of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This came as a complete shock to everybody at Lao Family," she said, "to the 
board of directors and the entire community, and it's taking a real toll. It's 
like throwing a stone into a small pool, and it just sent out ripples that 
affect the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Police Department Investigator John Enriquez said an unnamed 
official with the community center requested the investigation in June after 
becoming suspicious "through their normal checking of their bank statements." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's findings were turned over to state officials, who also 
had received reports that checks to buy food for the child care program and to 
meet payroll were bouncing, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
While Thao has repaid out of his own pocket some of the funds in question, 
attorney Bridgman said his client spent the money with the full knowledge of 
his board of directors on items related to the center, including the payment of 
delinquent federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Thao) would say it was in the interest of the Lao community 
center," Bridgman said. He added that there are "significant issues" that would 
dispute whether a crime was committed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that he cooperated with the authorities," Thao's attorney said. 
"It's clear that when it became a problem, he took it (the money) back." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also said the full amount would be repaid within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is going to be reimbursed every red cent," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgman said he has received letters of support for his client from members of 
the Southeast Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really been a major force in his community doing good," Bridgman said. 
"This is very sad for him. He's broken that this happened." 
</P>
<P>
Thao, who was released from jail Monday after posting a $50,000 bond, is 
scheduled for arraignment Wednesday in Orange County Municipal Court.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE: NEW LUXURY HOTELS PROJECTED TO BOOST ECONOMY $5 BILLION

Several new resort hotels planned for the coast could bring an extra $5 billion 
or so to the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. said 4,700 new resort hotel rooms are on 
the drawing boards in the county, a number that he said is likely to double by 
the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
There are 1,700 rooms in local resort hotels now. 
</P>
<P>
All those new rooms should boost the number of tourists who visit the county, 
said Gary Wescombe, one of the accounting firm's partners. In 1988 -- the 
latest figures available -- nearly 35 million tourists visited the county, and 
another million came on business or for conventions. 
</P>
<P>
Those people spent $6.5 billion, tourism officials estimate, nearly a third of 
which was spent on lodging. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels already planned include three in Huntington Beach. (Another just 
recently opened.) They have a total of 1,450 rooms. Then there are three hotels 
-- 2,150 rooms among them -- planned for the coastal hills between Newport 
Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And two hotels were planned in Dana Point with a total of about 1,100 rooms, 
but their future has been uncertain, because their Australian developer went 
into receivership last year.

Care Enterprises Inc., a Tustin-based nursing-facility company, posted a net 
loss of $22,000 for the second quarter, compared to a net loss of $455,000 for 
last year's second quarter. Revenue dropped 16% to $57.3 million from $68.4 
million. The company attributed the decline to fewer Medicare patients because 
of the repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act and to fewer nursing 
facilities operated during the second quarter of 1990.

Big-Time Groundbreaking: There aren't many groundbreakings that draw big-time 
developers Arthur B. Birtcher, co-chairman of Laguna Niguel's Birtcher; Anthony 
R. Moiso, president of the huge land-owning Santa Margarita Co., and hamburger 
magnate Carl N. Karcher. 
</P>
<P>
Those people and more, however, showed up this week for the groundbreaking of 
an extension of the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The center, run by the Sisters of the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart, is 
the only one in Southern California that concentrates on developing the faith 
of Roman Catholic children. 
</P>
<P>
The center, at 2927 S. Greenville St. near South Coast Plaza, has been open 
since 1979. The expansion will add 25,000 square feet, including an assembly 
room, dining hall, playing field and living space for the sisters. They hope 
for up to 29,000 visitors a year when the $3.8-million expansion is finished. 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher, Moiso and other local heavy hitters -- including County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley and home-builders Al and Jim Baldwin -- raised $4.3 million for 
the construction and for the sisters' work. Birtcher's construction company is 
general contractor on the project.

CLOTHESTIME'S NEW STRATEGY REDUCES ITS PROFIT;

EARNINGS: A NEW MERCHANDISING AND DISCOUNT STRATEGY HAS INCREASED SALES BUT 
DEPRESSED EARNINGS. COMPANY OFFICIALS SAY THEY ANTICIPATED THE SHARP DECLINE.

<P>
Clothestime Inc., the chain of women's discount fashion stores, said Friday 
that a change in merchandising strategy resulted in higher sales but lower 
profits for the second quarter ended July 28. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based chain has introduced more name-brand clothing in its 369 
stores nationwide and has offered deep discounts to attract new customers. 
</P>
<P>
The move has cut profits, said John Shanklin, vice president for finance. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime's second-quarter earnings dropped 53% to $1.5 million from $2.3 
million a year earlier. Sales were $57 million, a 9.5% increase from $52 
million in the 1989 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of fiscal 1990, sales rose 11.3% to $103.8 million, 
from $93.2 million a year earlier. Earnings were down sharply to $100,000, from 
$2.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Shanklin said the strategy to offer more brand-name merchandise and lower 
prices was part of a "long-term decision on our part to build market share. . . 
. People are trading up and being more price and quality conscious. It was done 
after a tremendous amount of market research." 
</P>
<P>
He said the chain is attracting an older, more sophisticated customer. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime is still expanding, with 385 stores expected to be open by the end 
of the year. Some of the new stores are in Southern California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, 
said Clothestime's earnings were in line with company predictions. 
</P>
<P>
The downturn in profits, Tashjian said, also reflects the continuing slowdown 
in the retail trade. "The company is back in an expansion mode and opening new 
stores up around the country," he said.

Irvine's fledgling Backstage Theatre netted about $400 from a benefit held 
earlier this week, according to the theater's artistic director, Al Valletta. 
But publicity was "more important" than the money, he said, noting that the 
event drew about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Backstage, which has staged one musical revue to date, will mount a second by 
mid-October, Valletta said. Its first, "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and 
Living in Paris," closed Friday and "has done so well," he said, "that 
something tells me people want us to stick to a cabaret-style show rather than 
leap into a drama." 
</P>
<P>
Valletta said he is considering two possibilities: "Starting Here, Starting 
Now," a 1977 revue with lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr. and music by David Shire 
or "The Me Nobody Knows," a 1970 rock musical adapted by Robert Livingston from 
a collection of children's writings with music by Gary William Friedman and 
lyrics by Will Holt. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Valletta has decided to seek a new location for the theater 
because he wants to double its capacity, which is limited to 45 seats. "I will 
keep this place till the lease runs out in February and then I'll look for a 
bigger place," he said. "I've got 50 seats in storage." Valletta had 
contemplated renovating the theater, now in an industrial office park at 2691 
Richter St., but changed his mind. He said he prefers to stay in Irvine, where 
he believes he has developed an audience, but would also consider moving to 
Costa Mesa.

CHILD-FRIENDLY ART LIVES AT LAGUNA FESTIVALS;

PARTICIPATE IN CREATIVE PURSUITS OR JUST WATCH.

Taking the children to a pricey art gallery can be about as soothing as a visit 
to the oral surgeon. If Muffy's brush with that crystal vase doesn't do you in, 
a glance at the price tags will. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are a couple of ways around this. Art-ogling moms and dads 
can hire a baby-sitter, up the limit on the Visa and go nuts, or pack up the 
family and visit one of Laguna's three outdoor arts and crafts festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Through Aug. 26, the Festival of the Arts, Art-A-Fair and the Sawdust Festival 
(all within a short hike or trolley ride of each other along Laguna Canyon 
Road) offer varied children's events and entertainment that allow parents to 
breathe easy as they browse among the works of local and national artists. Most 
activities are free with admission. Children 12 and under are admitted free 
with an adult at all three sites. 
</P>
<P>
At 58, the venerable Festival of the Arts (650 Laguna Canyon Road) is the 
granddaddy and features works by 164 local artists in a lush, park-like 
setting. The Pageant of the Masters, a tableaux of "living pictures" featuring 
hundreds of area volunteers, is presented each night at 8:30 in the adjacent 
Irvine Bowl. Pageant tickets range from $9 to $35. (A festival spokeswoman 
recommends the show for ages 4 and up, but perhaps add two to three years to 
that, just to be safe.) 
</P>
<P>
In the Junior Art Gallery, 150 works by children across the county are on 
display, ranging from kindergartners' finger-paintings to sophisticated oils by 
high-school students. 
</P>
<P>
If a glance at the gallery stirs those creative juices, children ages 2 and up 
can toddle over to a free art workshop, held daily from 1 to 4 p.m. on the main 
lawn. Projects include brown-bag hand puppets and crayon drawings; materials 
and encouragement are provided at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if your kids prefer watching to doing, they can catch one of the 
print-making or ceramics demonstrations held throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Family entertainment includes Alturas, a band of Bolivian instrumentalists that 
appears each Saturday at 5 p.m., and "Dance America," a showcase of U.S. dance 
styles through the ages presented each Sunday at 5 p.m. by Ballet Pacifica. 
Mime Sharon Hallingdal will stroll the grounds today from 1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Festival of the Arts is open 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. daily. Admission: $1 to 
$2. Call (714) 494-1145. 
</P>
<P>
The World's Largest Kaleidoscope, a 30-foot scope with a room-size walk-in 
viewing area, is one of the kid-pleasers at the Art-A-Fair (777 Laguna Canyon 
Road), which showcases the works of 150 local and national artists. 
</P>
<P>
In free workshops at the Childrens Activity Center, exhibitors offer hands-on 
instruction in watercolor, clay modeling and paper-making to dabblers 2 and up. 
Visitors can buy an unfinished ceramic piece, apply their own glazes and watch 
it be fired in the Art-A-Fair kiln. Prices range from $2.50 to $28; available 
on weekends only. 
</P>
<P>
Folk singers and instrumentalists provide most of Art-A-Fair's entertainment. 
Look for the most eclectic mix on Saturday nights. Art-A-Fair is open 10 a.m. 
to 10 p.m. daily. Admission: $2.50 to $3.50. Call (714) 494-4514. 
</P>
<P>
On the entertainment deck at the Sawdust Festival (935 Laguna Canyon Road), the 
lineup can include anything from award-winning jugglers to marionettes. 
Headliners include Passing Zone, a pair of juggler/comedians who recently took 
top honors at the 1990 international Juggler Festival. The duo will make its 
final appearance today from 11 a.m to 5 p.m. On Sunday, it's the Scott Land 
Marionettes, at noon and 2 p.m., followed at 5:30 p.m. by the Thunder Mountain 
Boys bluegrass band. (Check the performer's board near the deck for a complete 
schedule.) 
</P>
<P>
Weekdays are a little quieter, but you can usually catch a least a couple of 
acts during your visit. On Tuesday and Thursday, for example, the California 
Juggling School will hold a free juggler's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
A booth for young artists offers a special preschoolers session each weekday at 
10:30, where ages 6 and up can participate in daily classes that run from 11:45 
a.m. to 3 p.m. Activities include painting, toothpick sculpture and 
jewelry-making. Face-painting is also available for a few dollars, and 
glass-blowing demonstrations are held periodically. 
</P>
<P>
The Sawdust Festival is open Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., 
Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Admission: $3 to $4. Call (714) 
494-3030.

Your article regarding the drop in ranking for the Newport Harbor Art Museum by 
the California Arts Council created an undeserved, negative image ("O.C. Arts 
Groups Praised, Criticized," July 27). Yes, it is difficult to carry on without 
a director and curator. 
</P>
<P>
However, we are fortunate to have a capable staff (that) keeps the museum 
moving forward. Our exhibition schedule is set through the summer of 1991 and 
our education programs are operating at full capacity. 
</P>
<P>
We were criticized for "appearing to reach only white, Newport Beach people." I 
am one of 100 volunteer docents who provide daily tours to people of all 
backgrounds and income levels, especially school children who visit with their 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
For many who do not speak English, it is their first exposure to a contemporary 
art museum, and as art is a universal language, it opens an exciting new world 
for them. The school tours are augmented by an outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
One week before a tour, each class is visited at the school by a docent who 
gives a slide presentation about the art the students will see at the museum. 
Docents visit many schools in Fullerton, Garden Grove, Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, 
Huntington Beach, Irvine and other cities, as well as Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
This outreach and tour program has proven to be very successful in whetting 
children's appetites for the arts, and it greatly enhances the limited arts 
education most students in Orange County receive. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the transportation subsidies the museum provides guarantee a visit 
to the museum for some schools unable to visit otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the Docents provided group tours for more than 18,000 
children and adults. Docents also toured 7,800 individuals at special events; 
4,385 students throughout Orange County had an Outreach Program in their 
classrooms. We serve more people who live outside Newport Beach than in it. 
</P>
<P>
We make a concerted effort to tour all ethnic groups by offering foreign 
language tours or tours with interpreters. We offer art appreciation programs 
for three-year-olds through seniors, for culturally deprived and those with 
special needs. 
</P>
<P>
We are a major cultural resource, not just locally, but regionally.

REPLACING STRIPPED DOOR SCREWS MEANS ADDING WOOD PLUG

Q. I've got a pine china cabinet built in the 1920s that's in need of a repair 
on one of the doors. The screws on one of the hinges have become stripped over 
time. I'd like to do the job myself if it won't take much work. 
</P>
<P>
C.M., 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. "The best way to repair it is to drill into the stripped screw holes and 
glue wooden dowels into the new holes," says David Moyes of Moyes Custom 
Furniture in Anaheim. "Use a chisel to make the dowel even with the door's 
surface, and use sandpaper to smooth it out. After you let the dowels dry for 
about half a day, you can screw the hinge in again." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'd like to clean the chimney in our house before winter. What kind of 
equipment do I need? And what's the best way of going about it? 
</P>
<P>
A.J., 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
A. "It's really a filthy, messy job, you'd better think again before doing it 
yourself," says Judy Kocher of Don's Chimney Sweep in Santa Ana. "Professional 
chimney sweepers use a special high-powered vacuum designed specifically for 
the chimney. It has a high-density filter that's able to catch the dust, which 
is so fine it passes right through any ordinary vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
"A chimney sweep will spread drop cloths around the hearth and carpets, then 
work from the top down, trying to brush debris down. He then reaches in and 
vacuums around the smoke shelf, which is the U-shaped wedge in the damper area, 
then wire brushes and checks the operation of the damper. It's about a $60 job, 
and you should figure on having it done whenever you burn a full cord of wood. 
</P>
<P>
"A homeowner can do a lot to keep a chimney and fireplace clean. Don't burn 
newspaper or new wood, since they tend to be very dirty. And the composite 
easy-burning logs you get at the supermarket are also bad; they leave a wax 
deposit along the walls of the chimney that's hard to remove. Burn dry seasoned 
wood from a reputable wood dealer -- that's the best advice. 
</P>
<P>
"And never clean a chimney with water. It deteriorates brick and cement and 
rusts metal." 
</P>
<P>
Q. Our asphalt shingle roof leaks in one of our bedrooms when it rains. How do 
I go about finding and stopping the leak? 
</P>
<P>
T.P., 
</P>
<P>
La Palma 
</P>
<P>
A. "Roofs tend to leak at perimeters and projections," says Don Coulson of Lee 
Roofing in Costa Mesa. "Check around the vents or antennas that protrude from 
the roof to see if there's any damage. 
</P>
<P>
"You can also look in the attic space above the bedroom and see if there are 
any water stains above you. To patch it, clean the area with solvent, patch it 
with fiberglass or mesh, then seal with mastic or roofing cement. If the patch 
is in a conspicuous place, you can get gravel to match the granules on your 
shingles at a roofing supply store and sprinkle it on the mastic." 
</P>
<P>
Q. Our garage door springs are about 20 years old and have some light rust in 
places. How long are they supposed to last? 
</P>
<P>
S.D., 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
A. "It depends on when and where they're made and how much they're used," says 
Don Phelan of Phelan Door in Orange. "The important thing is that if it doesn't 
have a safety rod, it should be changed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime in the early 1970s all springs sold had to have safety rods built 
into them so they wouldn't shatter when they broke, but there are still a 
number of springs out there that don't have them. 
</P>
<P>
"An important thing to remember is that the pivot points on the hardware must 
be oiled once a year to keep them operating feely. If the top arm should snap 
away while the door is closed, it can swing down with the power of a 
guillotine. Use a spray-on lithium grease, available at most hardware and auto 
parts stores."

TAKE YOUR CHOICE OF COUNTER TOPPINGS; 
</P>
<P>
KITCHENS: MATERIALS CAN RANGE FROM GRANITE TO TILE TO WOOD, BUT EACH HAS 
DRAWBACKS AND THE PRICE RANGE CAN BE EXTREME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
No other surface in a house takes the kind of punishment kitchen countertops 
get. Not only do they have to withstand the torture of heat and cold, spills 
and scratches, chopping and pounding, but when the work is done, we expect them 
to look as if they've never even been used. 
</P>
<P>
Even in their idle moments, kitchen counters earn their keep. More than any 
other component, they set the tone for the whole room, whether it's the earthy, 
informal look of tile or the super-clean appearance of a continuous smooth 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Tile has long been a popular choice in Orange County, as it is all over the 
southwestern United States, says Steve Salazar, owner of Kitchens Del Mar in 
Corona del Mar. But it's now being challenged by the toughest surface of all: 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
"Granite is indestructible," Salazar says. "It's impervious to stains, to heat 
-- you could start a fire on it. You can chop on it, slide things across it. It 
doesn't matter. About the only way you could do a granite countertop any damage 
would be if something sharp and very heavy hit it on the edge. Then it might 
break." 
</P>
<P>
Because the stone must be polished to a high gloss to be properly sealed, 
granite still shines after a simple cleanup when the work is done. 
</P>
<P>
Granite is also expensive, ranging from $75 to $150 a square foot, installed, 
depending on the stone itself, the time and effort necessary to fabricate it, 
and the individual conditions in a kitchen, such as the number and angle of 
corners and cutouts for sinks and stove tops, Salazar says. 
</P>
<P>
The granite used for kitchens here may come from as far away as South America 
or the Mediterranean, he says, or it may be from domestic quarries. The most 
exotic-looking slabs, with intricately colored veins, are usually South 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners get closely involved in the process, not only choosing the 
individual slabs of granite they want for their kitchens, but even deciding 
where and how they want the stone to be sawed so that particular veins of color 
are highlighted, Salazar says. 
</P>
<P>
Granite's strength is also its weakness. It's an unforgiving surface, which 
means there's no room for mistakes or even fudging inaccurate measurements. 
"Whatever you do with granite, you can only do it once," Salazar says. For that 
reason, it is not recommended for do-it-yourselfers. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a professional installer, Salazar warns, it's possible to spend as 
much as $10,000 and end up disappointed. "Before you hire someone to install 
granite countertops, demand to see an installation he's done in somebody's 
kitchen. Not a photo. You need to actually see it. You want someone who deals 
with an established granite fabricator and who has experience with the 
material." 
</P>
<P>
The choices in color and pattern of granite surfaces is limited only by nature 
itself, but it is limited. Not so with solid-surface synthetics such as Corian 
or Fountainhead, which has a stonelike appearance. Less expensive than granite 
at about $35 to $60 per square foot, installed, synthetics come in a wide 
selection of both solid colors and patterns. Whatever the choice, synthetics 
are exactly the same all the way through. That comes in handy if they get 
stained, burned or scratched, all of which can happen. If it does, the damage 
can usually be sanded off, leaving the countertop looking new again. 
</P>
<P>
For homeowners who want a single smooth surface throughout the kitchen, 
solid-surface synthetics can be attached to sinks made of the same material. Or 
for a decorative touch, two or more colors or patterns can be combined without 
breaking the continuous surface. 
</P>
<P>
Tile is where do-it-yourselfers get a chance to excel, although many homeowners 
still prefer to select the material and design and let someone else do the 
dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an infinite variety of things you can do with tile," Salazar says. 
"You can combine colors, textures, sizes. You can add hand-painted or 
custom-made tile. You can get different looks with different colors of grout, 
and with different widths of grout." 
</P>
<P>
Tile can be as inexpensive as $5 a square foot, installed, or it can cost as 
much as $50 with custom-made tiles, Salazar says. 
</P>
<P>
Tile is most popular for the Southwest or French look, although it can be used 
with many other styles as well. 
</P>
<P>
But tile does have its drawbacks. "It's not a flat, even surface, and that can 
be a problem," Salazar says. "Also, the grout is very, very porous, which means 
it's susceptible to stains." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the old standby from the '60s, the laminated countertop. 
</P>
<P>
Laminates, such as Formica, are inexpensive -- $5 to $10 a square foot, 
installed -- and they come in "thousands" of colors and patterns, Salazar says. 
"It's a very functional, scratch-resistant surface," he says. "But it's not 
very flexible. It can be bent, but only in one direction." 
</P>
<P>
Laminated tops can be dressed up with wood or tile trim to make them less drab. 
</P>
<P>
Wood countertops, once all the rage, are no longer nearly as popular, Salazar 
says. "It's a rich, natural look, but it burns, stains, scratches. It takes a 
lot of maintenance. And if you chop onions on a wood countertop, it's going to 
smell like onions for a long time after that."

PREVENTION THE KEY TO CLEAN UPHOLSTERY; 
</P>
<P>
HOME MAINTENANCE: WEEKLY VACUUMING, AIRING AND OCCASIONAL SHAMPOOING KEEP 
FABRICS LOOKING GOOD.

Your favorite armchair may still be comfortable, but is it still clean? 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips for keeping upholstered furniture looking as good as it 
feels: 
</P>
<P>
To prevent dirt and dust from becoming embedded in the fabric, give upholstered 
furniture a thorough vacuuming weekly. Move the upholstery attachment nozzle 
slowly over all surfaces, including channels, tufts and welts. Use the vacuum's 
crevice-tool attachment to clean hard-to-reach spots. 
</P>
<P>
If the cushions smell dank from humid weather or other household odors, air 
them outdoors on a dry, breezy day. Place the cushions in the shade (to avoid 
fading) on a clean surface for several hours. Turn them over at least once 
while airing. 
</P>
<P>
Even with regular vacuuming and airing, upholstered fabrics require thorough 
cleaning at some point. The method you choose depends on the fabric. Synthetics 
and cottons are often washable, so they can be safely shampooed with a mild 
detergent or a commercial cleaning product. Most other fabrics require dry 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Natural fabrics other than cotton usually need to be dry-cleaned professionally 
for a complete cleaning. But soiled or stained areas can often be spot-cleaned 
using a commercial solution sold for removing spots on clothing. When applying 
these compounds, always wear rubber or vinyl gloves and work in a 
well-ventilated area. 
</P>
<P>
Before applying a cleaner of any kind, always test for colorfastness on a small 
area of a part that is never seen, such as on the back zipper side of a cushion 
or on the arm next to the cushion. Let it dry to see if it causes shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the procedure for cleaning cotton or synthetic upholstery using the 
suds of homemade cleaning solution. Remember to use only the foam: Never apply 
the solution itself. 
</P>
<P>
1. Prepare the following equipment and supplies: a whisk broom or a vacuum with 
an upholstery attachment, a rubber or plastic scraper, a pan of warm water, 
soft cloths and paper towels. Put two tablespoons soap flakes and two 
tablespoons ammonia in 1 quart hot water. 
</P>
<P>
2. Brush or vacuum the furniture well. After the cleaning solution has jelled, 
whisk it until a mass of suds forms. Rub suds into a small, concealed area of 
the fabric. Let it dry. If the area fades, discolors or shrinks, have the job 
done professionally. If not, shampoo the rest of the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
3. With a suds-covered cloth, gently rub the suds in a small area. When the 
suds become soiled, scrape them off with the scraper. Wipe the scraper clean on 
paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
4. Wet a cloth in the warm water, wring well and wipe sudsed area. Dampen the 
fabric only slightly, don't soak it. 
</P>
<P>
5. Repeat these steps, overlapping previously cleaned areas. Change suds, rinse 
water and cloths when they get dirty. Dry the upholstery with an electric fan.

BOOKSHELVES CAN BOTH STORE AND SHOW OFF HANDSOME VOLUMES; 
</P>
<P>
LIBRARY: DESIGNER FINDS A VARIETY OF WAYS TO MAKE BOOKS EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR 
REFERENCE AND READING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
True bibliophiles can easily become overwhelmed by their collections, finding 
themselves frustrated by boxes of books packed away in attics or garages. 
Disintegration is worrisome but being cut off from a wealth of information and 
inspiration is torturous. 
</P>
<P>
Roxann Johnson of Spatial Expressions, a total design service whose "side 
specialty" is built-in entertainment centers, recently encountered a client 
with "tons and tons" of books in storage. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge was to find a place to put them," Johnson says. "Fortunately, 
the living room of the family's Anaheim Hills home has a 20-foot-high vaulted 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"We created a library by building a railed balcony at one end of the room that 
extends out by 5 feet. A miniature spiral staircase leads up to walls of 
built-in shelves, a small seating area and a nice view as well," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
"When books are used and not just displayed, a nearby reading area is 
important," Johnson explains. That means, at the minimum, that a chair, a table 
and good lighting are required. In the Anaheim Hills project, Johnson provided 
a cozy reading nook by extending one end of the balcony with a slight curve. 
</P>
<P>
In another situation, Johnson created a handsome and substantial room divider 
to update a home built in the '60s that featured a lava-stone column by 
"cantilevering" bookshelves 2 inches from floor to ceiling between the columns. 
</P>
<P>
In a different home, Johnson found a way to make a hallway closet do double 
duty. The 24-inch-deep closet backed up to a bedroom. After taking off the door 
and moving the back wall of the closet a foot forward, shelves were installed 
on both sides of the new wall, providing a double-sided bookcase accessible 
from either the hall or the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Creative solutions are available for more modest book collections as well. 
Mini-libraries of paperbacks can be housed in the alcoves created by finishing 
a knocked-out portion of a wall and placing narrow shelves between the studs. 
Or, Johnson suggests extending the end of a kitchen countertop 12 inches and 
adding a row of cantilevered shelves below it to hold a collection of 
cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
If your book collection is sparse, art objects, plants and stereo equipment can 
fill in the shelf space for a practical and eye-catching display. "Just 
remember," she says, "bookcases are visually heavy." For that reason, walls of 
books should be offset by large pieces of furniture such as sofas. 
</P>
<P>
"Books are nice, homey and sound-insulating," says Johnson, who recommends 
placing bookshelves on a common walls separating a bedroom from a dining room 
or kitchen. For the same reason, a wall of books in a noisy family room softens 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
When planning a bookshelf, Johnson offers these suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
Add backs to bookcases that are against outside walls or near windows to 
protect the books from moisture and extremes in temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Keep books away from windows and skylight because sunlight fades covers and 
dries pages. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting finishes, Johnson notes that because painted surfaces chip and 
scratch easily they do not hold up well under the weight of heavy books. "The 
most traditional material for bookcases is wood," she says, "but keep in mind 
that dark stains will show more scratches than pale finishes." 
</P>
<P>
"Melamine and laminated surfaces are more modern-looking as well as durable. 
For a more traditional look, add wood molding to the edges," Johnson advises. 
"Or, treat wood with polyurethane to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also recommends building bookcases slightly deeper than needed and 
providing low-intensity track or recessed lighting to shine on titles. "Strip 
lights and shelf lights are practical and attractive ways to display a fine 
collection," she adds. "For small areas, heavy glass shelves that allow the 
light to shine through are another possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Most bookshelves measure about 1 inch thick, 12 inches deep and 30 inches wide, 
but allowances should be made when extra-heavy or large books need to be 
stored. 
</P>
<P>
Provide thicker shelves or extra supports between shelves for heavy books like 
encyclopedias, she says. Oversized books need more "headroom" as well as a 
wider shelf. Mix books with lightweight accessories to avoid sagging shelves. 
</P>
<P>
For those who decorate with neutral tones because they are afraid of using 
color, Johnson offers this advice: "Books add a nice touch of color to many 
otherwise bland rooms. When using books solely for effect, cover them with 
paper and fabrics in color and textures to suit the decor." 
</P>
<P>
If you aren't an avid reader, but want to grace your home with the warmth and 
charm associated with books, an inexpensive way to gather a decorative 
collection is by shopping garage sales, thrift shops and used book stores.

COOL DECORATING INVITES THE OUTDOORS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Service.

<P>
There are environments that seem to breathe coolness and serenity: soft colors 
from the blue-green spectrum, undraped windows framing a view of the outdoors, 
and the absence of clutter. 
</P>
<P>
As we weather the hottest days of the year, giving our surroundings a cool look 
and the ambience of a house at the shore can help. 
</P>
<P>
Interior designer Victoria C. Cooke believes that decorating for summer is as 
necessary as "changing your wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
"In winter, we need the warmth of curtains, and we tend to arrange our 
furniture near the fireplace, yet in summer we orient ourselves toward the 
French doors and the outside," Cooke says. 
</P>
<P>
Designers agree that a "less-is-more" philosophy is the key to coolness. 
Clearing the clutter from table-tops and replacing curtains and drapes with 
panels of lace or sheer, see-through white cotton or linen are the options they 
frequently mention. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Linsley, author of the just-published design quarto "Nantucket Style" 
(Rizzoli, $40), knows a lot about how to create that summer look. An island 
resident, she visited dozens of Nantucket homes in the course of researching 
her book. 
</P>
<P>
White, all-weather wicker used indoors and outdoors is a staple of island 
summer decorating. Fashioned from specially treated wicker woven onto an 
aluminum frame, this new variety of wicker is hardy, handsome and available in 
classic design styles. 
</P>
<P>
"It has that wonderful 'Great Gatsby,' old-porchy kind of look," Linsley says. 
The old-fashioned, non-weatherproof wicker is popular, too. Its airy weave, 
portability and adaptability to many different styles of interiors have made 
wicker furniture -- which was ubiquitous from the 1880s through the 1930s -- a 
summer standby. Even a single chair or a small table in white or neutral wicker 
can lend a serene note to a room. 
</P>
<P>
Another house-at-the-shore look is the pickled floor, Linsley says. 
"(Homeowners) give their floors a white or soft, seashell-pink wash and just 
use scatter rugs." 
</P>
<P>
Cooke finds that the sisal rug, made from woven straw fiber, is an inexpensive 
floor covering suited to summer living. Available in its natural color or in 
soft, dyed shades, the sisal rug can be customized with a stenciled border of 
flowers or other design motif. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer, we need to decorate to allow the breezes to blow through the 
house," says Cooke, who likes to replace drapes with a simple curtain of sheer 
fabric such as lawn, voile or batiste. Many designers advocate no curtains at 
all during the summer. The window itself thus becomes a frame for the world 
outside, and the colors of the yard become part of the interior. 
</P>
<P>
Another inexpensive design alternative for the window is a roller shade of 
rattan, bamboo or paper.

WATERFORD PROTEGES OFFER NEW CRYSTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Distributed by Associated Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To connoisseurs, elegant lead crystal means Ireland, where mouth-blown, 
full-lead pieces have been made for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Irish crystal does come dear, but a relatively young Irish company, Tipperary 
Crystal, offers a line that equals the quality of the famous Waterford but 
sells for about 30% less. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bernadette Ryan, who owns the Grafton Shoppe in New York City and 
the Irish Shoppe in Block Island, R.I., the crystal is one of the best-selling 
lines at these two Irish crafts stores. 
</P>
<P>
"My customers buy it for special occasions, especially for weddings and 
anniversaries," she says. It also is much more readily available than 
Waterford, she adds. Many of the pieces are engraved, either with initials or 
with dedications for special events -- "a nice alternative to silver." 
</P>
<P>
Tipperary might be considered a lineal descendant of Waterford because it is 
run by a group of former Waterford craftsmen who formed the new company in the 
wake of Waterford's restructuring a little over two years ago. A leader of the 
group, Joseph Foley, was a 24-year Waterford veteran who took advantage of a 
restructuring buyout option and found a backing partner to start the company. 
The group makes crystal the traditional way by mouth-blowing, then hand-cutting 
each individual piece. The lead content is over 33%, which gives the crystal 
strength and durability, and imparts a slight bluish color. Cutting serves the 
same function as faceting in gems, adding sparkle and iridescence. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional suites, or patterns, are named after landmarks near the company's 
cottage factory in Ballynoran, County Tipperary: "Carrick," after the historic 
village; "Slievenamon," named for the legendary mountain; and "Dovehill," a 
Norman castle once commanded by Connet O'Moore, a 14th-Century Irish chieftain. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan says one of the most attractive ways to display crystal is to mix 
patterns. And: "Use it every day. It's meant to be enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
The combination of quality and price (a water goblet will sell for about $40, a 
wineglass for $33) has made it popular with Americans, who make up much of its 
market, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
The crystal, imported through Kraftware/Morgan in New York, is sold at Irish 
and other specialty shops as well as through the P.J. Carroll catalogue (800) 
255-3933.

BEAUTY, CHARM OF A VICTORIAN HOME; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: THE SWEEPING AND VARIED DESIGNS COVER A MAJOR PART OF THE 19TH 
CENTURY.

<P>
Not much can match the beauty of a properly restored Victorian home. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you're lucky enough to own one or merely dream of someday buying a 
Victorian, there's lots to learn about these romantic old houses. 
</P>
<P>
Mention the word Victorian and many folks think of Queen Anne or Italian-styled 
structures. Although these are two of the more plentiful Victorian designs, 
many different styles fall into this sweeping period -- a time span that covers 
the better part of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest Victorian style, the Gothic Revival (1835-1865), was based on the 
romance of medieval architecture and inspired by English and German cottages. 
You'll recognize a Gothic Revival house by its sharply pointed gables. Windows 
are usually tall and thin, sometimes with diamond-shaped, leaded panes. 
Medieval motifs, such as Gothic crosses and trefoils, may be cut into the 
structure's woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
The Gothic revival gave way to the Italianate period (1845-1880). Based on the 
cottages of Italy, houses of this style are characterized by their arched 
windows and doors, sometimes topped with decorative lintels. The Italianate 
mansions commonly have flat, wide roofs with large brackets under the overhang. 
A cupola often crowns the top. These highly symmetrical houses were often built 
from natural local stone or brick. 
</P>
<P>
Few smaller houses were constructed in the Second Empire or Mansard style 
(1860-1885). Usually considered mansions, they are easily recognized by their 
distinctive mansard roofs, often tiled in slate, and dormer windows. Carpenter 
Gothic (1870-1910) houses feature lots of sawn-wood ornamentation, called 
gingerbread, at gable peaks and verge boards. Porches have sawn brackets on 
posts and cornices. 
</P>
<P>
A rule of thumb when approaching this or any type of restoration is to try to 
save as much of the original structure as possible. In a Victorian restoration, 
particular emphasis is placed on preserving the ornate architectural details, 
along with the original siding materials. 
</P>
<P>
If you're lucky, the original gingerbread or brackets may only need repainting. 
If not, you'll find they are rotted or damaged beyond repair. If that's the 
case, you can either have replacements custom-made or order new reproductions 
from the millwork companies that specialize in this type of thing. The latter 
is the most economical if several pieces are missing or damaged. When you need 
to replace only a few, the custom route makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
As far as siding goes, it can be fairly easy to restore the wood. In most 
cases, it involves paint removal, sanding, priming and repainting. Damaged 
pieces are either patched and repaired or replaced. Don't be tempted to replace 
wood siding with vinyl or aluminum. You'll lose the texture and a lot of the 
authenticity of your Victorian house. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to roofing materials, most houses built in the 19th Century had 
wood-shingled roofs, usually made of cedar. Slate and tile roofs were also 
common. In most cases, today's asphalt shingles, which come in a variety of 
textures and colors, are an acceptable and less expensive replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, some owners find it necessary to add some living space to their 
old house. As long as the front and sides of the structure are maintained 
historically, the back end can usually be altered without losing the charm.

WITH THE RIGHT GARDEN, YOU CAN CREATE A RAINBOW DURING DROUGHT

Even during a drought, a landscape can bloom with color. 
</P>
<P>
Rely on shrubs, flowers and herbs that thrive when rainfall is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the favorites flourish in hot, dry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Annual flowers are probably the best choice for an arid landscape. Some of the 
most heat-tolerant annuals are portulaca, zinnia, tithonia, sanvitalia, salvia, 
marigold, petunia, nasturtium, globe amaranth, four o'clocks, gazania, celosia, 
California poppy and cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
Drought-resistant perennials include rudbeckia, coneflower, daylily, achillea, 
artemisia, gas plant, coreopsis, hardy lily, gaillardia, butterfly weed, 
cranesbill geranium, Siberian iris, malva, monarda, sedum and veronica. 
</P>
<P>
Ornamental grasses are also capable of withstanding hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
For background color, choose heat-loving shrubs like cinquefoil (Potentilla 
fruiticosa), dwarf winged spindle tree (Euonymus alata compacta), vanhoutte 
spirea (Spiraea vanhouttei), tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima), yucca (Yucca 
filamentosa) and Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius). 
</P>
<P>
Herb plants are exceptionally heat tolerant too. Lavender, catmint, thyme, 
oregano, sage and chives ignore parched soil.

VOCALISTS IN 'ECHOES OF THE BIG BANDS' SPOTLIGHT 
</P>

Nothing succeeds like nostalgia when it's pledge time on PBS. "Echoes of the 
Big Bands With Merv Griffin," airing tonight at 8 on KCET and KOCE (Channels 28 
and 50), is ideal for those older viewers whose pockets are well enough lined 
to guarantee hefty donations. 
</P>
<P>
The title is something of a misnomer. "Echoes of the Big Band Singers" would 
have been a closer call. You see Merv Griffin, who kiddingly opens the two-hour 
show with a mock introduction of the Freddy Martin Band in which he sang, but 
Martin's band never appears. 
</P>
<P>
The Harry James Orchestra is there in a couple of old black and white clips, 
but two James' band vocalists that are seen, Helen Forrest and Dick Haymes, 
have five songs between them. Similarly, Herb Jeffries gets far more time than 
the Duke Ellington Orchestra, and the Dorsey Brothers segment is devoted to a 
parade of singers -- Bob Eberly, Helen O'Connell, the Piped Pipers, Connie 
Haines, Jack Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
The program in effect reminds one of the thin line that separated big band 
music and jazz from dance music or simply vocal entertainment. In several 
instances the performers are seen in black-and-white scenes from the 1930s or 
'40s, followed by longer passages showing the vocalists in the 1970s or early 
'80s, in color, backed by a house band at Roseland or some other ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise is not how sadly they have deteriorated, but how well they have 
held up. Helen Forrest was and still is one of the pre-eminent pop band 
singers; Herb Jeffries, Cab Calloway and Bea Wain sound better now than then, 
and the blues numbers by Joe Williams and the late Helen Humes with the Count 
Basie Band are unalloyed joy. 
</P>
<P>
The best instrumentals are Artie Shaw's "Concerto for Clarinet," and a Benny 
Goodman number never before seen on TV, taped a year or two before his death, 
with a flawless all-star quintet: Red Norvo, Dick Hyman, Louie Bellson and Slam 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
If the decades have been kind to the singers, they have done nothing for some 
of the songs. This becomes embarrassingly evident in the pseudo-hip lyrics and 
gauche mannerisms in "Kalamazoo" by the Modernaires, "Let Me Off Uptown" by 
Anita O'Day and Roy Eldridge, and Woody Herman's "I've Got News for You." That 
was truly an age of innocence. But if one is in a receptive mood, or 
inquisitive about how it was back then, these echoes reverberate pleasantly 
enough.

IT'S SHAKESPEARE AS YOU LIKE IT -- FREE OF CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
Sometimes, the best things in life really can be free. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you count Shakespeare as among those best things, then you are in luck. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego this summer, free weekend performances of two Shakespeare 
productions are being presented: a classically costumed "Romeo and Juliet" by 
the Spring Valley-based Octad-One Productions and a raucous, modern-robed "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" by the Naked Shakespeare Company, a subdivision of the 
Ruse Performance Gallery downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Neither company is professional, but both clearly care about the work they are 
doing and both present community theater with a healthy emphasis on community 
by using local actors. 
</P>
<P>
For some of these actors, this is their first chance to perform Shakespeare. 
But they get audiences, here; so far this summer, locals have been turning out 
in the hundreds for each weekend show. 
</P>
<P>
Both productions take place outdoors -- Octad-One's is in the amphitheatre 
outside the East County Performing Arts Center and Ruse Performance Gallery's 
is in Alcazar Gardens in Balboa Park -- are high-spirited and virtually devoid 
of props. Without scenery, there are no scene breaks; the plays run swiftly and 
smoothly without intermissions. The attentive and appreciative audiences need 
no reservations, and people tend to bring their own chairs and blankets as well 
as pizzas, Chicken McNuggets and other picnic goodies. The audiences are all 
ages, and dress is casual -- T-shirts, sandals and jeans. Little children have 
been seen with Cabbage Patch dolls in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Octad-One, now in its 10th year, has found a magical place to present what it 
calls its Shakespeare-by-the-Lake. The shows begin at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays 
and Sundays through Aug. 26, so they get their principal lighting first from 
the sun and then, as the sky darkens, from a spotlight that begins to shine in 
time for the young lovers' moonlight balcony speech. 
</P>
<P>
The set design is by none other than Mother Nature; trees and a lake act as 
backdrop, often enhanced by a gentle breeze. 
</P>
<P>
As directed by Martin F. Gerrish, president and founder of Octad-One, the 
production emphasizes the innocence and youth of the principal players. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo and Juliet, here, are literally high school-aged; Morgan Brown, who plays 
Romeo, is still a student at Granite Hills High School and Alexandra Auckland, 
who plays Juliet, just graduated this year. 
</P>
<P>
If the two are not expert at the subtleties of characterization, they do 
succeed in capturing the aching loveliness of teen-agers groping to understand 
the passions ruling them. This production makes it hard to forget that Juliet 
is only 13 in the play. 
</P>
<P>
More mature performers are here, too, to give balance to the show, particularly 
Don Pugh as a forceful and charismatic Mercutio, and Bruce Erricson as the 
anxious Friar Laurence. Jane Hopf earns her share of laughs as Juliet's 
ever-pragmatic nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Butler's sound design romanticizes the mood with gentle incidental music. 
The fight choreography by Donald Pugh lends an authentic feeling of danger. The 
director's wife, Elaine Gerrish, designed the lovely period costumes. And the 
company, in its program, provides a synopsis of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Ruse Performance Gallery is presenting "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in modern 
dress -- colorful exercise stretch tights and skirts for the women, with shorts 
and T-shirts for the young men. It's the first of what director Christopher R 
hopes will become an annual free Shakespeare presentation by The Naked 
Shakespeare Company. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Octad-One production, the Naked Shakespeare company benefits from its 
setting. In the Alcazar Gardens in Balboa Park, the play begins at 4:30 p.m. 
Sundays through Sept. 23, with one Saturday performance Sept. 1. It is a woodsy 
grotto that needs no props to conjure up the forest in which the lovers lose 
themselves. And, happily, the company provides blankets for the audience to sit 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher R succeeds best when he fosters the natural enthusiasm of his 
company. The exercise outfits, for example, encourage a welcome playfulness in 
the actors. 
</P>
<P>
The production falters when ideas appear that are not carried through. What is 
the point of having Theseus bring in an angry Hippolyta in chains? There is no 
transition between that scene and the later scenes where she is in love with 
Theseus. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a minor distraction in what is largely a high-spirited, 
entertaining romp through the story of four mismatched lovers who go "into the 
woods" and find everything made right again. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, like that in Octad-One, is a mix of those new to Shakespeare and 
those familiar with it. Andy Wynn, a sadly under used local actor, stands out 
as Oberon, the fairy king, who sets things right. Cindy A. Lu, as Oberon's 
messenger sprite, Puck, has some genuinely funny moments. So does Murray 
Stanley as Nick Bottom, the weaver. The young lovers are a green but appealing 
lot, with Lee Allison making a vivid mark as Helena, the ultimate woman who 
loves too much. 
</P>
<P>
The overall feeling is unpretentious. The actors scamper up and down the walls 
in the park with abandon, and their high spirits are infectious. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher R said he last used the Alcazar Gardens space 15 years ago when he 
was the co-founder of Indian Magique, the company that was the precursor of the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
To the appreciative audience that numbered about 250 Sunday night, it was a 
happy return. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason that journeymen and apprentices can't take on a full 
Shakespeare," he said after the show. "This is a street theater version of 
'Dream.' In a way it helps to have naivete, because then you don't know you 
can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no charge for either show, contributions are accepted after 
each performance.
