CONCERT YAHOOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewer Chris Willman was right on the mark in describing the disruptive 
"beer-guzzling yahoo" element in the audience at Jackson Browne's Aug. 12 
Amphitheater concert ("Browne Proves There's Plenty on His Mind," Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
But Willman was far too kind. Do these loud, obnoxious clods (who should be 
confined to arena shows) really believe that anyone wants to hear them jabber 
during songs and whistle and scream every time the performer takes a breath 
between songs? 
</P>
<P>
It had been more than 10 years since my wife and I had seen Browne. At one 
time, he could talk between songs and quiet piano solos could be performed 
without some jerk shrieking. 
</P>
<P>
But that was way back, when audiences were still listening.

In her July 28 review of the film "Distant Voices, Still Lives," Sheila Benson 
writes: ". . . an unseen, bass voice, which may even be Paul Robeson's, sings 
'There's a Man Going 'Round Takin' Names.' The voice happens to be that of 
Jessye Norman, and how Benson could mistake it for a man's voice, especially 
Robeson's, I would be interested to know.

CIRCUS ANIMALS' PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently attended the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and was 
appalled by what I saw. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the second act, live bears were made to perform on motor 
bikes in apparently uncomfortable positions. Bears were chained on their backs 
so they could balance batons that resembled cigarettes. One bear, being led 
away, was jerked backward several times and almost knocked off balance. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the bears, seals, elephants, tigers, etc., I could not but feel 
remorse for the animals and their plight. 
</P>
<P>
I have always loved the circus, or thought I did. This time, I felt like a 
little boy who had been told there is no Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
My consciousness has been raised. Never again will I attend a performance where 
"wild animals" are used for the entertainment of humans.

PILGRIMAGE TO AUSCHWITZ; 
</P>
<P>
A JEW FINDS PEACE IN CARMELITES' CONVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEENA METZGER, Deena Metzger is a Los Angeles-area poet and author. Her 
novel, What Dinah Thought, will be published in October. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The process of reconciliation is based on the tenet that all parties will 
emerge from the dispute with respect and acknowledgment of one another's 
position. Last spring I reached the conclusion that it was necessary for me, an 
American-born Jew, to make a pilgrimage to the death camps of Eastern Europe. 
It was to be an interior journey, a commitment made to myself: to look as 
unflinchingly as I could on the face of evil, to sit in grief for my people and 
all others who had been murdered, to bear as best I could the cosmic 
disappointment of it all, and then to ask unbearable, even impermissible 
questions: How can we heal this agony? What peace can be made? How can we give 
up the concept of enemy? 
</P>
<P>
At Majdanek, at the mass grave of 18,400 Jews murdered in one night, the answer 
to that last question was clear: Stop the making of enemies. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, I knew that I must not approach the camps as if I were 
going to museums or learning a history lesson. Something else was required. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, I had been reading and thinking about almost nothing else 
but Nazis and Jews. If something was to be healed, obviously it had to be 
healed there, and my mind reeled from that thought. It came as a surprise, 
then, at the end of the journey, that I found some peace, even healing, among 
Christians -- German and Polish women, nuns of the Carmelite order who have 
committed their lives to prayer in the places of greatest suffering, Auschwitz 
and Dachau. 
</P>
<P>
It is uncommon to receive an invitation to the Auschwitz convent. The nuns 
there are cloistered. Silence and prayer are the order of their days. The nuns 
at Dachau are cloistered as well, but their chapel is accessible to the public, 
a sanctuary for visitors to grieve or meditate or otherwise assimilate the 
psychic assault of the camp. 
</P>
<P>
I was apprehensive but also grateful when the nuns responded affirmatively to 
our request to visit them. I wanted the experience of sleeping, even dreaming 
in the camps. I had a vague feeling that the presence of the sisters might be 
comforting, their silence soothing, as I felt my way through grief and 
confusion. Still, I was not unaware of the bewildering, sometimes malevolent 
role of the Roman Catholic Church, both during the Shoah and afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
I use the word Shoah because subtly embedded here is one of the most profound 
distinctions between Catholics and Jews and their responses to the Nazi death 
camps. In the words of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris, who was born 
Jewish and whose mother died in Auschwitz: "I prefer to say 'the Shoah' (Hebrew 
for annihilation) rather than 'the Holocaust,' because holocaust means 
something else; it is a free offering given to give glory to God." 
</P>
<P>
As I understand it, for most Jews the Nazi attempt to annihilate the Jewish 
people was so senseless and horrific that it can have no redemptive qualities. 
To suggest otherwise is a fraudulent, even dangerous, comfort. But for 
Catholics, the Holocaust meant the possibility of martyrdom, of offering 
oneself in the image of the redemptive offering of Christ, for the glory of God 
and the sake of all human beings. 
</P>
<P>
It was in this spirit that the controversial Edith Stein, considered by some to 
have been the most formidable female intellectual of her time, perished in 
Auschwitz as a Jew although she was a Catholic convert and a Carmelite nun. She 
was beatified by the Church in 1987 under her religious name, Sister Teresa 
Benedicta of the Cross. 
</P>
<P>
It is this way of thinking, and the visibility of the Catholic presence at 
Auschwitz, which has led some Jews to protest that Catholicism is appropriating 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, I and my husband, Michael Ortiz Hill, who is Catholic, stood 
at the door of Karmelitanki Bose at Oswiecim (as it is known in Polish). Hours 
before, we had both been shocked by the view of the convent's 23-foot cross 
from the window of the chamber where Cyklon-B was used for the very first time. 
</P>
<P>
Though the precise figures can't be known, when we speak of the Nazi 
extermination program at Auschwitz, we are speaking about the murder of 3 
million to 4 million Jews and 1 1/2 million non-Jews, many of them Catholics, 
and, as the mother superior noted, so many of them nuns and priests. "We pray 
for them all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That evening and the next day, despite the language barrier, we focused on the 
power of prayer, the need to heal, ways to approach Auschwitz -- and on the 
insistence by some Jewish leaders that the nuns quit Auschwitz because their 
presence usurps the most symbolic of all monuments to the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
We experienced the depth and breadth of the compassion of these women as the 
mother superior recounted stories of those years of suffering, including her 
mother's unsuccessful attempt to hide a Jewish child and her own encounter with 
the Nazis when she was 10 and they came to her family's farm looking for Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Ashamed of myself for envying her safety when it was my parents' families that 
would eventually be found and killed, I was still deeply relieved to have 
personal acquaintance with those who had resisted the Nazis. In my anguish, I 
needed more than anything the assurance that some people did act morally and 
with spiritual conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Jews want Auschwitz for themselves," my son Marc said when I returned 
home, "because they can't bear the idea that anyone else may have suffered as 
much." He is right, I thought, but I don't want to co-opt the Shoah for myself 
or be a party to its exploitation by anyone, even Jews. To the contrary, I was 
relieved to hear the nuns speak also of the suffering of their people because 
it gave me hope that non-Jews would strive to see that this would never happen 
again. I did not want to walk through Auschwitz thinking "this is mine," any 
more than I could bear the fact that Auschwitz-Birkenau had been built for the 
extermination of those who were mine. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, when Michael and I dug our fingers into the soil at the 
crematories at Birkenau, we came up with handfuls of ashes and bones; I did not 
need or want to trace their genealogy. I had begun to realize while meditating 
before the brick ovens that if human beings could do this, then human beings 
could destroy the entire planet -- that we are every one of us mortally 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Auschwitz and Dachau are maintained by their respective governments as museums. 
Auschwitz is the most popular tourist attraction in all of Poland. But is it 
possible to understand the depth and horror of what occurred in such a secular 
setting? Meditation, prayer and contemplation are what open the heart to what 
is otherwise mere thought. Yet nowhere on the grounds of Auschwitz is there a 
place for meditation. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish exhibit at Auschwitz, with its now too familiar displays of 
photographs and documents, had unnerved me, an assault of outrage and pain 
offering neither succor nor understanding. 
</P>
<P>
At Birkenau, I found shelter from the crowds in a remote barrack where I sat on 
the long, cement latrines while longing for a temple or chapel, some spiritual 
refuge where I could gather myself together or completely fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
Days later, when we arrived at Dachau, I was gratified that the menorah atop 
the Jewish memorial in the camp is as visible from the convent as the cross is 
from the laboratory of death at Auschwitz. In the early morning, I lit all the 
candles in the memorial that I could reach, but within a short time it was 
overrun with people, conversing, snapping pictures; in the afternoon it was 
locked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we have a chapel in each of the camps?" I wondered. "Because there's 
no one left to do it," Michael answered gently, reminding me that there were 
only a few hundred survivors in Berlin, Krakow, Warsaw and Vienna, cities that 
had once been major centers of Jewish life. So, I thought, it's left to 
Christians to keep the vigil of prayer at our graves. The Church and Jewish 
leaders once reached a compromise (now in abeyance) to remove the nuns and 
establish a center for Christian-Jewish dialogue elsewhere. But this would not 
respond to the commonly felt need for a spiritual presence at the site of such 
horror and personal devastation. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns at Dachau had greeted us with a special kindness in an effort to ease 
what they could of our pain. We listened to the extraordinary beauty of their 
voices at Vespers in the simple chapel built over the quarry, where priests who 
had resisted Nazism were routinely sentenced to death by hard labor. The 
service drew heavily from the Psalms, a comforting common liturgy. These women 
have the hardest task, I thought, trying to redeem the crimes done by their own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
It came to me very strongly then what "Never again!" ultimately means: Never 
again, for anyone; never again shall people do such things, and never again 
shall people suffer such things. If that is to be ensured, I realized, it is 
essential for the nuns to stay in that place and do their soul-searing work.

WE'RE ONE BIG FAMILY IN THE CAMERA'S EYE

<P>
Almost from the day (150 years ago this week) Louis Daguerre introduced 
photography to the world, our appetite for reproduced images has been fierce. 
Today, our entire culture is dominated by the camera and its technological 
offspring. The whole world reaches us in pictures -- color pictures in the 
newspaper, moving pictures at the cinema, live ones on TV, insinuating ones on 
billboards -- and we seem always to want more, more. Music itself, once content 
to be lent an ear, now claims our eyes as well, as the pop music train is 
pulled along by the locomotive of video. 
</P>
<P>
One picture in particular seems to be enjoying not just a vogue these days but 
an almost mystical popularity: the image of our planet seen clearly from space. 
It's in the news, in our advertising and corporate logos, in our art and our 
literature. Earth seen from space, the blue-green sphere neatly framed by the 
screen, seems to capture our cares about ecology, our hopes for peace, our 
pride in a planet that can send back pictures of itself from so far off. 
</P>
<P>
There's almost a rhythm to the stages by which such imagery has overtaken our 
culture, a 50-year beat of innovation. Photography began with the daguerreotype 
150 years ago; moving pictures arrived 50 years later, TV broadcasting 50 years 
after that. The global telecommunications network, the satellites and cables 
that now form the planet's nervous system, bombards us nonstop with an 
indigestible array of images, emotions, distant events. 
</P>
<P>
The confluence of these anniversaries reminds us how much of what we call 
culture is in fact the multiplication and miniaturization of images. We love to 
multiply images of our world, and we love to miniaturize them; that's what our 
photos do, that's what our novels, and our newspapers, our televisions and our 
toys do. 
</P>
<P>
Kids love little dolls and toy trains because they offer miniature worlds where 
the child has control. We respond to the same charm, I think, in front of our 
photo albums, our magazines, our ubiquitous screens. They all offer us 
miniature reproductions, manageable re-creations, of the world around us that 
lacks focus, lacks a frame. 
</P>
<P>
To multiply our images of the world is almost a divine prerogative, when you 
think about it. You create something new, so familiar (in your image!) and yet 
so easily achieved, with each trip of the shutter. Perhaps, though, photography 
and its continual reinventions are more reverent forms of behavior, as if, in 
obedience to the Biblical injunction to Be fruitful and multiply, humanity had 
responded not only biologically, but also with the printing press, the camera 
and the screen. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred and fifty years of being able to seize the world, yet leave it 
alone; of being able to see the familiar afresh; of being able to see far off 
in space and time. It's a mere century and a half that the images of loved ones 
have gathered around us so abundantly, and that history -- current, living 
history -- has been everyone's to witness. Surely the occasion, the smiling 
anniversary of a French scenery- painter's inspiration, is worth a celebration, 
worth remembering.

OK, now .. everybody say "Cheese!"

THIS MATTER OF ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Legislature, with welcome cooperation from Gov. George 
Deukmejian, has worked hard this session to overcome a record of inaction and 
neglect of major state issues. Now the lawmakers have a chance to reverse a 
sleazy image and the statewide impression that they abuse their offices for 
personal gain. The Legislature should seize this opportunity by adopting a 
tough ethics proposal before the end of the 1989 term next month. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics, and there were many of them, scoffed at the idea that the Legislature 
itself could draft a really effective reform plan. In the past, the Joint 
Ethics Committee has been a joke, in part because members of one house were 
reluctant to punish members of the other chamber. But both Senate President pro 
tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. 
(D-San Francisco) have developed comprehensive and credible ethics plans. 
Common Cause, the private good-government group, commended the Assembly plan as 
an "extraordinary effort," although adding it could stand some improvement, 
particularly in its enforcement provisions. 
</P>
<P>
While the two plans differ in details, each generally would limit or ban 
outside income and honorariums for the 80 Assembly members and 40 senators, 
provide for an independent commission to establish legislators' salaries, 
restrict gifts, prohibit legislators and state officials from lobbying their 
former offices for a year and apply campaign and fund-raising restrictions to 
legislative aides. Each house would have its own ethics committee. The Assembly 
plan would allow for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate 
alleged criminal violations. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the salary provision would require a state constitutional 
amendment approved by the voters. Under the Senate version, legislators' pay 
could never exceed that of a superior court judge, which now is $84,765, and 
there would be restrictions on collecting per diem expenses. The Assembly 
version would have the Legislature ratify the commission's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
These are minor details. The important point is that both houses now seem 
committed to a strong ethics and conflict-of-interest package. Some members may 
grouse about the tough restrictions, but the credibility of the entire 
Legislature rests on approval of the strongest possible plan.

ESCAPE FROM REPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From time to time through the centuries, European roads have become clogged 
with refugees. Pushing carts and carriages, leaving behind homes, pets and 
memories, people have fled repression or genocide in one country or another as 
the continent's map was drawn and redrawn by armies and national ambitions. 
Some may hope that such scenes belong to the past. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
Since May, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Turks have been fleeing across 
Bulgaria's southern border into Turkey. With the remnants of their former lives 
crammed in suitcases and car trunks, they are leaving towns and villages in 
southern and northwestern Bulgaria where they have lived for centuries. It is 
the largest flow of refugees seen in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of their flight is a type of repression that one would wish was also 
a thing of the past. Since 1984, the Bulgarian government has been on a 
campaign to wipe out Turkish culture in Bulgaria. The authorities have forced 
ethnic Turks -- who comprise 15% of the country's population -- to adopt Slavic 
names, forbidden circumcision and restricted Muslim religious services, 
including funerals. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, forced assimilation is an old Slavic habit. Since the time of the tzars, 
Russians have deflected international criticism of their treatment of ethnic 
minorities by simply claiming that such minorities do not exist. The 
authorities then forcibly "Russify" the groups, rewriting their history 
textbooks and changing their names. The Bulgarians are much like their Russian 
cousins. The Bulgarian government has for some time asserted that there are no 
Turks in Bulgaria, only "Bulgarian Muslims" -- Bulgarians who were forcibly 
converted to Islam under the Ottoman empire. Human rights watchers say that 
there is no evidence to support the contention. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons behind the government repression of the Turks are somewhat obscure. 
Some Bulgarian officials have hinted to Westerners that they are concerned 
about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Bulgaria. This excuse seems less a 
reflection of Bulgarian reality than a deliberate attempt to strike a chord of 
sympathy from those in the West who fear any growth of fundamentalist Islam. 
There is almost no chance of any such movement in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
The basic motivation behind the campaign is very simple: national chauvinism. 
The Slavs have a poor track record for tolerance of minorities and a long 
tradition of nationalist self-exertion. Luckily, Bulgaria's influential cousin, 
the Soviet Union, has been most visible in urging them to repeal these policies 
and halt the flow of refugees. But it remains to be seen to what extent 
Bulgaria is willing to join the Soviet Union and the rest of a more tolerant 
Europe, or how tightly it will cling to old, and reprehensible, national 
habits. It must decide soon. Nearly one-third of Bulgaria's Turks have already 
arrived in Turkey, crossing the border at the rate of 4,000 per day. 
International outrage is rising at the same brisk clip.

Hooray for The Times! I left Los Angeles last year because of the intolerable 
traffic and smog. Thanks to the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, in five years 
Los Angeles can once again have a fast and affordable alternative to the 
region's hopelessly congested streets and freeways. For those Angelenos who 
doubt the efficacy of light rail, come to San Diego and ride our fast and quiet 
trolleys. Don't miss this chance, L.A. -- it may be your last.

In your editorial, you urge that we, the overburdened taxpayers, purchase a 
railroad business in which even private companies are losing money. We already 
know that Amtrak and the RTD are big losers, that MetroRail is over budget, and 
now we've got this. I am sure a "Light Rail Bond Initiative" is just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
Rail proponents wrongfully assume that people want to go downtown and that 10 
years down the road they'll still be going downtown. 
</P>
<P>
To spur more flexible transportation, we'll have to repeal licensing laws that 
make it impossible for the little guy to have a taxi, mini-van, big bus or limo 
business, and that allow established companies to charge monopoly prices that 
hurt the consumer.

I am in favor of fixed-rail transit, having been in L.A. since 1920. 
</P>
<P>
With reference to the possible purchase of facilities from Santa Fe and 
Southern Pacific, let me suggest a little investigation. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that those right-of-way were grants without cost to the railroads. If 
such is the case, wouldn't it be nice if the railroads just turned them over to 
the people at the same cost? Or a 99-year lease at $1.00 per year would be 
nice.

I am old enough to remember riding the Red Cars from San Bernardino, and 
perhaps (by a trolley connection) even from Redlands, to Los Angeles. With 
their 1920's technology, they went as fast as 60 mph, if my memory is correct, 
and certainly that ride outclassed the experience of driving between those 
cities under present conditions. Since then, we have mindlessly allowed 
automobiles to become the curse of the planet. We should seize the opportunity 
to buy those ancient rights of way, and thus reduce that vast damage.

STILL THINKING OF R.M. NIXON

<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Kutler's article (Op-Ed, Aug. 8) on Richard Nixon's resignation is the 
same old rehash on the subject that we are always subjected to at this time of 
year. One certainly gets the feeling that Mr. Kutler is in a vain campaign 
against Richard Nixon! 
</P>
<P>
I really feel sorry for Mr. Kutler's students, as they will surely be required 
to read his negatively biased view of history. His students could use their 
time much more wisely by reading Mr. Nixon's book, "1999: Victory Without War." 
This is a book every college student should be required to read.

RELIGION'S ROLE IN BATTLING TERRORISM

<TEXT>
<P>
The abuse of language concerning recent Mideast events has created a prism of 
distortion through which America views the latest developments and it causes us 
to perceive a dangerously twisted image of reality. Israel's most recent blow 
against international terrorism with its capture of Sheik Obeid cannot be 
called a "kidnaping". 
</P>
<P>
I would like to invite public attention to the fact that in common English 
parlance, criminals are captured, seized, arrested, or apprehended; not 
kidnaped. Only innocent people are kidnaped. We are allowing ourselves to be 
trapped by the semantic deceptions of terrorism if we accept a label such as 
"kidnapers" when referring to Israel. We continue surrendering our moral values 
and our linguistic autonomy when we refer to Sheik Obeid as a "hostage". He is 
an accessory to murder who enjoyed total immunity until Israel acted with 
dazzling brilliance and surgical precision. Only innocent individuals are 
termed "hostages." Obeid is a prisoner.

RELIGION'S ROLE IN BATTLING TERRORISM

Mark A. Heller, in his Aug. 4 Op-Ed article, "A Bonanza for Hezbollah," sounds 
much like the uncivilized cowards he tries to ignore. He is correct in labeling 
his method for dealing with terrorists as callous. He is unrealistic in hoping 
this nation will condone the hanging of our citizens by lawless, unjust 
apostates (or, for the matter, anybody other than ourselves). 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring our problems with the Hezbollah is not going to make them disappear. 
We cannot expect the Hezbollah to one day become reasonable people willing to 
negotiate; we should not expect the Iranians to suddenly become nice guys 
willing to mediate for the release of U.S. hostages. Because "Government is 
instituted among us to secure certain unalienable rights . . . ," which we 
possess abroad as well as domestically, our government must respond to get back 
our countrymen and protect these rights. Even though the various factions in 
Lebanon are not officially recognized as legitimate political groups, we have 
to actively respond to their endless murdering. Either overt or covert military 
operations are now warranted as an effort to recover the hostages. The time for 
talk is past.

Casey Kasem insists on razor-sharp distinctions in his letter of Aug. 9. He 
calls it a lie that Egypt began hostilities to open the 1967 war, when, in 
fact, Israel struck first, even if pre-emptively. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, Casey! Egypt did more than saber-rattling; she struck the first blow 
-- and also the second. She opened the hostilities by closing the Straits of 
Tiran to Israel. International law dictates that closing an international 
waterway to any nation is a declaration of war. Furthermore, in doing so, Egypt 
violated the terms of her own pact as made with Israel following the 1956 Sinai 
war, namely, never to block the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
The second strike, tantamount to a declaration of war by Egypt, was when 
(then-President Gamal Abdel) Nasser demanded of the Secretary General of the 
United Nations at the time, U Thant, to withdraw the U.N. peacekeeping force 
stationed between Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. Nasser explained that he was 
going to engage Israel militarily at any hour. U Thant complied and the rest is 
history. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, there was still another provocation of even greater 
proportion. Nasser influenced Iraq, Syria and Jordan to surround Israel in a 
"ring of steel" poised to pounce on the tiny nation. Could there be any greater 
threat to Israel than that? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kasem, when the flames of the fire begin to lick all around you, do you sit 
there to absorb it all? One would think you would respond to it. That's just 
the point. Israel responded -- to the acts of war initiated by Egypt.

Professional football players apparently require something special to induce 
them to play up to their maximum ability (other than their outrageous 
salaries), but the Raider players seem to be misguided in this regard, 
dedicating their season to a player who got totally inebriated (during training 
season) and killed himself in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Surely they could find someone more inspiring than this.

BIG-MONEY FIGHTERS DON'T HAVE HUNGER TO ENTERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the evening of Aug. 14, nearly $3 million was paid to two big-name 
middleweight fighters who didn't fight. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nunn isn't "second to none," he's a bum who runs and doesn't look cute 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Iran Barkley punched as if he was underwater, when he bothered to throw a 
punch.

<P>
These big-money bouts have nearly ruined the sport of boxing. Luckily, there is 
a plethora of hungry boxers fighting on cable television every week to keep 
real boxing fans entertained. 
</P>
<P>
I salute the club fighters of American and hope Michael Nunn sleeps well at 
night, knowing that he'll never get clocked by a real punch no matter how long 
he's paid to dance around the ring and twitch his shoulders.

ZEILE GETS OUT OF BOX QUICKLY IN BIG-LEAGUE DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Zeile had been patient so far, but this time he couldn't wait. 
</P>
<P>
The team bus wasn't leaving for another two hours, but Zeile wanted to arrive 
at Riverfront Stadium before any of his new St. Louis Cardinal teammates. 
</P>
<P>
For Ozzie Smith, Pedro Guerrero and Vince Coleman, playing a doubleheader 
against the Cincinnati Reds might not be that thrilling. After all, they 
already had played 119 games this season and hundreds before that. 
</P>
<P>
But for Zeile, Friday was the first day of his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile, who was called up from the Cardinals' triple-A team in Louisville on 
Wednesday, was two for four in the second game after grounding out to third as 
a pinch-hitter in the first game. Zeile's first major league hit was a single 
to center in the fifth. He also had an infield single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of me realizes I'm finally here and the other half thinks I'm dreaming," 
Zeile said before the doubleheader. "This is a goal I've been trying to reach 
for a long time. I hope to make it last." 
</P>
<P>
Zeile, along with Sandy Alomar Jr. of the San Diego Padres, have been touted as 
the two best catching prospects in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Before his promotion, Zeile had enjoyed success at every level of competition. 
He was a third-round selection in the June, 1986, free-agent draft after 
standout careers at Hart High and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for Springfield, Ill., at the Class-A level, Zeile was named co-most 
valuable player in the Midwest League. He led the league with 106 runs batted 
in and was second with 25 home runs. After suffering a broken bone in his right 
hand, Zeile batted .270, hit 19 home runs and drove in 75 runs with Arkansas, 
the Cardinals' double-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, Zeile married former Olympic gymnast Julianne McNamara 
of Encino. After making his first appearance at St. Louis' spring training camp 
in St. Petersburg, Fla., he was ticketed to play a full season for the 
Cardinals' triple-A team in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cardinals told me I would need to spend a full year in Louisville," he 
said. "I didn't think I was going to be called up this soon." 
</P>
<P>
In 118 games, he was second in the American Assn. with 85 RBIs and fourth among 
all triple-A players. He also ranked in the top 10 with 19 home runs and a .289 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile, who will turn 24 next month, replaced first baseman-outfielder Jim 
Lindeman on the Cardinals' roster. He was informed of his promotion during a 
team picnic. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager called me to the side and said there has been a change of plans 
and I was going to join the Cardinals in Cincinnati," Zeile said. "I first told 
Julianne at the picnic and then I called my parents in Valencia. I told my mom 
the news and for a half-second our hearts were beating and we didn't know what 
to say." 
</P>
<P>
Zeile's awe carried over to his arrival at the ballpark where he said he felt 
like a fan walking into the Cardinals' locker room for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is very exciting," Zeile said before the game. "I stood at the 
door of the clubhouse for about five minutes and let everything soak in. I got 
my stuff situated. I looked at my name on the back of my jersey. Then I'll get 
into my daily routine and try and relax a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nervous, but that will change when the umpire says 'Play ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis thinks Zeile is ready to be the team's full-time starting catcher 
beginning next season. Incumbent Tony Pena, who made the All-Star team for the 
fifth time this season, becomes a free agent next year and his $2 
million-a-year price tag may be too expensive to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals hoped to trade Pena this week, but he failed to clear waivers, 
negating a possible deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile was told by Manager Whitey Herzog that he will share catching duties with 
Pena until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I'm going to come in and Pena's not going to play any more," 
Zeile said. "They're not going to turn their back on him. He's having a decent 
year and we're still in the pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get 30 games under my belt and get some seasoning. I'll worry 
about winning a starting job after next spring training. I just got here." 
</P>
<P>
Sooner than most expected.

<P>
It took three days but Woodland Hills West finally got a taste of adversity in 
the American Legion Northwest regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, most of it took place off the Lewis-Clark State College field. 
</P>
<P>
West defeated Meridian, Ida., 5-4, Friday night in a battle of the tournament's 
lone remaining unbeaten teams, but not without fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
First, starting shortstop Ricky Banuelos and West Coach Gary Gibson got into a 
pregame tiff that resulted in Banuelos stripping off his uniform, packing his 
duffel bag and heading toward the team hotel from the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bobby Kim, sidelined with a jammed thumb Thursday, was first omitted 
from the lineup and then penciled in after threatening to follow Banuelos 
through the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
And even though both players remained -- Kim started and Banuelos appeared as a 
pinch-hitter in the eighth and stayed in the game at shortstop -- it took a 
two-run, two-out double by Del Marine on an 0-2 pitch in the top of the ninth 
inning to hand West a win. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Paul Geller was safe on a fielding error by Meridian first 
baseman Don Barowsky. Geller barely beat a last-second, sweeping tag attempt as 
he hit the bag at first. Anybody remember Bill Buckner? 
</P>
<P>
Ryan McGuire followed with a double to left-center and Marine then ripped a 
curve to the gap in left for the game-winner. The hit was Marine's ninth of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was doing was praying that Ryan would get up," Marine said. "I knew if 
he got up, I'd get up, because he'd get on base." 
</P>
<P>
Marine took a fastball for a called strike and a curve for strike two. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I saw both pitches I knew he was mine," Marine said. "I saw that 
curveball coming all the way." 
</P>
<P>
It was barely enough to hold off Meridian. Or make that Meridian's Tory Miran. 
</P>
<P>
Miran homered, doubled and relieved starter Sean Harris in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Miran, who will be a sophomore at Nevada Las Vegas in the fall -- he was in the 
starting rotation last season as a freshman -- struck out six batters in three 
innings and nearly choked West's hopes of cruising into the tournament final 
without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth was his 12th inning pitched in three days, however, reaching the 
tournament limit, and he could not pitch the ninth. David Brown replaced him 
and took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the ninth, McGuire walked Lee Reiber with one out and Miran 
with two out. Barowsky grounded out to second baseman Geller to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, why not. You always got to throw in a couple of walks to make it 
interesting," said McGuire, who relieved starter Jason Mitchell in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
West (33-5) will play Vancouver at 7:30 tonight. West needs two more wins to 
advance to the World Series in Memphis, Tenn., next week. 
</P>
<P>
Meridian broke a 3-3 tie in the seventh when Dennis Gerosian singled to 
left-center and scored on a double by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
A Meridian error also helped West get on the scoreboard and overcome a 2-0 
deficit in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Marine led off with a single to left, moved to second on a walk to Jason Cohen 
and scored on a single by Kim. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Marks followed with a sacrifice bunt to third that Bill Detmar threw away 
at first, allowing Cohen and Kim to score for a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
West could have scored more. With one out, Gregg Sheren was safe on shortstop 
Brad Wickam's overthrow at first, putting runners on second and third. Carl 
McFadden grounded to third, and Sheren was picked off second for the third out.

SACRIFICE HITTERS; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYING MAJOR DIVISION WOMEN'S SOFTBALL REQUIRES SUMMER OF COMMITMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM BERNSTEIN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer softball. The phrase conjures images of high-arc slow pitches, pot 
bellies and barbecues -- an impression that is not always accurate. 
</P>
<P>
In the Amateur Softball Assn. Major Division there are headfirst slides, 
squeeze bunts, pickoff plays and enough high-intensity action to hook even the 
most skeptical of fans. 
</P>
<P>
The major division is to softball what the major leagues are to baseball. It is 
the ultimate goal for top college and high school players. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, a few not-so-subtle differences. Lucrative contracts, 
signing bonuses, endorsement opportunities are to be found nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Softball, even at its highest level, is a game of sacrifice. To play at the 
major division -- a level attained by a dozen Valley-area women -- one must 
make a commitment for the duration of the summer. For three months, 
doubleheaders and tournaments are crammed into each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
And if the grind isn't enough, there are financial burdens to consider. Hotel 
bills, tournament entry fees, transportation costs and meals are, in most 
cases, paid by players who spend their vacation time trekking from one 
tournament to another. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're playing now you really love the game because you're putting in a lot 
of time and money," said Barbara Jordan, a former three-time All-American 
outfielder for Cal State Northridge in 1985-87. 
</P>
<P>
There are 80 to 100 major-division teams nationwide. Most of the games are 
played in tournaments; there is no league with a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the nation's best teams are based in Southern California, including the 
SSK/Invasion, which plays its home games at CSUN. Other Southern California 
teams are the Orange County Majestics, the Whittier Raiders and the Los Angeles 
Diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Invasion, Majestics and Raiders are playing in the 18-team ASA national 
tournament this week in Decatur, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The Invasion's travel calendar this summer is typical of major-division teams. 
In June, the Invasion played in four tournaments -- two in Las Vegas, one in 
Arizona and another in Bakersfield. In July, it competed as the West squad in 
the U. S. Olympic Festival in Oklahoma City, winning a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
Juggling a job with a high-caliber hobby like major-division softball is a 
difficult daily double. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of retiring from softball because it is getting hard to do both," 
said Priscilla Rouse, who plays center field for the Invasion when not working 
as a computer-program analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The Invasion is fortunate in that it is one of the few major-division teams 
with a corporate sponsor. SSK, a fielding glove manufacturer, has a two-year 
contract with the Invasion for $25,000 -- pittance for a baseball team of the 
same caliber but a substantial sum in women's softball. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Invasion Coach Joe Getherall says, it is "not nearly enough for a major 
women's team." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hardships associated with the sport, an invitation to play for a 
top team is rarely turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Debby Day, a former Burbank High standout, planned to take this summer off 
after her sophomore season of pitching for the University of Texas-Arlington. A 
chance to play for the Invasion changed her mind, however. 
</P>
<P>
Day is a two-time All-Southland Conference selection who led Division I 
pitchers in strikeouts as a freshman. Nevertheless, she claims that the 
prospect of playing in major division was "a little intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
Even the best college teams have but a few players of All-American status, yet 
major teams are dominated by a long list of players with glossy resumes. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Weeks, president of the ASA, says Southern California is the nation's 
hotbed for fast-pitch softball. "Other parts of the country look up to Southern 
California teams and strive to be like them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of major-division players are college age, but others have been 
competing for more than a decade. Debbie Langevain, 34, was drafted by the 
Santa Ana Stars, a now-defunct professional team, in 1975. She opted to retain 
her amateur status in hopes that she may someday compete in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
She is still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Although softball is being considered as an Olympic exhibition sport, a debut 
in 1992 at Barcelona is unlikely. Spain, the host country, does not have a 
national softball team. However, softball is played in the biennial Pan 
American Games and the Olympic Festival, which is held annually with the 
exception of Olympic years. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other chances to play overseas. Langevain has twice traveled to 
China, once as a member of the U. S. national team and once with the L. A. 
Diamonds. She also has played in New Zealand and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Travel -- for those who can afford it -- is one of the few tangible rewards for 
top players. Yet a steady stream returns to the diamond each summer. 
</P>
<P>
They are aware of what few outside the sport's inner circle know -- that major 
division is the place for top softball competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people know what major softball is about," said Jordan, who 
plays for the Redding (Calif.) Rebels. "There are people who walk by a game and 
stay the whole day because they are amazed."

AMERICANS IN PARIS PLAN TO TEACH NATIONAL PASTIME TO THE FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the best tradition of (Swordless) Marquis de Lafayette, (Lefty) Mitterrand 
and Napoleon (Pee Wee) Bonaparte, the French are playing baseball, and a 
Valley-area-based team has gone to Paris to help them do it better. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast Baseball School, located in Agoura Hills, is one of the sponsors 
of a squad that left Thursday for a two-week trip to Paris. The team will help 
the French senior national team prepare for the upcoming European 
championships, which will be held in Paris the first 10 days of September. 
</P>
<P>
According to comedian Steve Martin, the French language has a different word 
for everything, but the French word for baseball is, not surprisingly, 
baseball. The U. S. players will try not to lose anything in the translation. 
</P>
<P>
While coaches and players spout the standard pre-international competition 
lines about "cultural experiences," "educational opportunities" and "mutual 
understanding," outfielder Doug Rich of Thousand Oaks spoke for his teammates 
when he said: "They kind of feel we're going to overpower them. We'll just have 
to play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
With baseball due to become an official Olympic sport in the 1992 Games, 
interest has been rising throughout the world. The French, who did not compete 
in either the 1984 or 1988 Olympic baseball exhibitions, are looking for a 
little Yankee ingenuity to help them in the European championships. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what the U. S. players will be doing, though, will be on the order of 
teaching the French the difference between a two-bagger and a baguette. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go there and teach them the manners and the etiquette," said 
Manager Bryan Maloney, a coach at the baseball school and a Thousand Oaks 
resident. "We're just going over there with a few plays that they may be behind 
in doing." 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. team has been formed under the aegis of International Sports Group, 
Inc., a not-for-profit organization that fosters international athletic 
competition. The 16-player U. S. roster is composed mainly of high school 
seniors and college freshmen and sophomores, many of whom have Valley-area 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
Two Westlake High players, second baseman Tim Falsken and pitcher Joe Orlando, 
and Crescenta Valley High first baseman Eric Berger are among the four high 
school players on the squad. Cal State Northridge third baseman Denny Vigo, 
Camarillo's Chris Sorich, who plays for Ventura College, and Mike Kissick of 
Thousand Oaks, who pitched for Santa Barbara College, also will be taking 
round-trippers to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. and French teams likely will scrimmage and drill together, although 
the exact composition of the workouts will be at the French team's discretion. 
The U. S. players will be looking to impress not only the French but also their 
coaches, Maloney and Mitch Miller, both of whom are scouts for the Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a few players that are very intense about going over there and doing 
well," Maloney said. "Some are using it for experience and others are looking 
at it as a vacation before going back to school." 
</P>
<P>
Maloney and Miller recruited the players in the course of their scouting 
duties, and in some ways the trip is an extended professional tryout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for them to get familiar with us and among each other," 
Maloney said. "The players that are going over there we're really going to bear 
down on next year." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all play and no sightseeing makes Jacques a dull boy, and the 
players also plan to sample the enticements of Paris. It is the first trip to 
the City of Light for most. They'll be singing "Take me out to the Louvre" and 
soaking up the nascent French baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, though, they probably won't hear about Marie (The Splendid 
Splinter) Antoinette.

RESTRICTIONS SOUGHT ON LARGE HILLSIDE HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky moved Friday to expand temporary 
building restrictions throughout the hillsides of Sherman Oaks to prevent the 
construction of big houses on small, sloping parcels of land. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's motion would ban houses taller than 30 feet, require front and 
back yards to be at least five feet deep and prevent houses from covering more 
than half of their lots. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the City Council approved the same limits for a swath of hillside land 
between Beverly Glen Boulevard and Camino de la Cumbre. The expanded area would 
include all hillside property bounded by the San Diego Freeway, Mulholland 
Drive, Valley Vista Boulevard and Dixie Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's proposed measure, which must win City Council approval, was prompted 
by neighborhood concern over a developer's plan to build up to 20 houses along 
Hopevale Drive, a narrow hillside street. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers are building these gigantic homes on small slivers of land," said 
Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "The houses are 
totally out of proportion for the neighborhood. If 20 of them go up on one 
street it could really create havoc." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Gould, a spokesman for CTC Management of West Los Angeles, said the 
development firm has not finished plans for the homes it wants to build on 
Hopevale and that only preliminary survey work has been done. The houses will 
not be disproportionately large for the parcels of land, which average about 
5,000 square feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking to build homes of the scale that they have been building in 
Beverly Hills, the kind that people are complaining about," Gould said. He 
added that residents will benefit from construction because it would stabilize 
slopes against erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Yaroslavsky said Friday he intends to move the expansion of the 
restrictions through the approval process within 30 to 60 days, so that a 
strict law will be in place before the developer begins construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subdivided in 1920s 
</P>
<P>
The undeveloped Hopevale plots were legally subdivided in the 1920s and cannot 
be changed, Yaroslavsky said. If the plots were subdivided today, more 
stringent hillside construction standards would require them to be about three 
times as large. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately we can't change the tract maps," Yaroslavsky said. "But we can 
control the building." 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the controls will be in effect for one year while planners and 
community leaders draft permanent zoning restrictions to regulate hillside 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Residents along Oakfield Drive, known as "Stilt Street" for its eye-catching 
row of historic houses built on stilts, sought restrictions on the construction 
of large homes more than a year ago.

SANTA CLARITA TO CONSIDER DAY-LABORER CRACKDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN IS 'HORRENDOUS,' REFUGEE GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed Santa Clarita city ordinance would make it a misdemeanor for day 
laborers to solicit work on city streets or sidewalks -- a measure that 
immigration rights groups said would be the harshest move yet in Los Angeles 
County against the workers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, to be considered by the City Council on Tuesday, also 
would make it illegal to hire a day laborer off the street. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really horrendous," said Ruth Capelle, acting director of the Central 
American Refugee Center in Los Angeles. She said she had never heard of such a 
strict measure aimed at day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy said Friday that she doubted the city would take 
such a hard line against the laborers. "I don't think we'd ever do it," she 
said. The main issue, she said, is safety, not immigration control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommendations Sought 
</P>
<P>
The City Council asked city staff earlier this month to recommend ways to 
control the laborers but did not specifically request a measure that would make 
it illegal to solicit work from streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
The laborers, who gather along San Fernando Road in Newhall, sometimes stand in 
the street or rush out into traffic to be the first in line for a job, Darcy 
said. Construction work along San Fernando Road has made conditions even more 
dangerous, and she said she feared that a job-seeker might be killed in 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies recently warned the laborers 
to stay out of traffic, and the problem seems to be improving, Darcy said. 
Traffic safety was the main complaint the council heard about the laborers, but 
Darcy said some residents and merchants accused the laborers of loitering and 
littering. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for day laborers called the proposed Santa Clarita ordinance 
misguided and unwise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Have Any Options' 
</P>
<P>
"Turning job-seeking into a crime really doesn't solve much," said Anne 
Kamsvaag of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants Rights of Los Angeles. 
"Realistically, these people don't have any options. They're not just going to 
evaporate." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition and the refugee center last year successfully lobbied the 
Glendale City Council to reject an ordinance similar to the Santa Clarita 
measure. Instead of banning day laborers, the compromise worked out between 
immigration rights groups and the city allowed the Catholic Youth Organization 
to establish a site for the workers to gather each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Los Angeles is expected to open a gathering site for day laborers 
in the Harbor area. The site is part of a $90,000 pilot program to establish 
eight such sites in Los Angeles, said Bill Molina, a management analyst with 
the city Community Development Department. A site in Pacoima could be opened by 
October, he said.

SIMI POLICE SEIZE 2,068 POUNDS OF COCAINE; 5 COLOMBIANS HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley police on Friday announced the largest seizure of cocaine ever by 
law enforcement officers from Ventura County -- 2,068 pounds with an estimated 
street value of $94 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure and the arrests of five Colombian nationals, however, were made in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said four days of investigation 
took narcotics detectives from Simi Valley to Newhall and Chatsworth before the 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 p.m. Thursday, officers stopped a car under surveillance on the Golden 
State Freeway in Newhall and found 277 pounds of the drug, Miller said. They 
arrested the driver, Angelo Alviro, 41, whose address is unknown, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, investigators served search warrants at houses in Chatsworth and 
Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
At a house in the 9600 block of Gierson Avenue in Chatsworth, investigators 
found 1,791 pounds of cocaine in a van parked in the garage and arrested Roceo 
Campo, 26, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
At a house in the 25000 block of Wintergreen Court in Newhall, no drugs were 
found but three people were arrested. They were identified as Efraim 
Belalclzar, 38, and Derly De La Cruz, 27, both of Newhall, and Francisco 
Altoreilo, 28, of Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
All five were being held on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
Miller declined to reveal details of the investigation but said it was 
connected with his department's seizure in May of $2.5 million in suspected 
drug profits and the arrests of one Guatemalan and three Colombian nationals in 
Simi Valley and Chatsworth. The four were not charged because no drugs were 
found, but were later deported. The cash was seized under state forfeiture 
statutes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation that led to the most recent arrests is continuing. He 
noted that his department was joined by federal agents, Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a U. S. Attorney General's report earlier this month, which said 
Southern California is an importing point for as much as half the cocaine 
brought to the United States, Miller said large busts may become more 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the size of the seizure, Miller said he believes that more cocaine is 
being distributed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the destruction" of this one drug ring, he said. But "it will set 
them back." 
</P>
<P>
Miller spoke at a news conference at which bundles of the drug were displayed. 
Packaged in burlap and newspaper, they were marked with codes that police had 
not deciphered. Some were wrapped in plastic marked Coca-Cola.

GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY REOPENS OVER GRAPEVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All lanes of the Golden State Freeway were opened to traffic near the Los 
Angeles-Kern County line Friday, nearly 11 hours after a fiery collision 
involving five vehicles left one woman dead, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident at 8:30 p.m. Thursday occurred when the brakes on a double-trailer 
truck apparently failed and it barreled down the northbound slope of the 
Grapevine, about 10 miles north of Frazier Park, at about 100 m.p.h., said 
Officer Mark Ehly. 
</P>
<P>
The truck struck a car and a U-Haul truck before turning over and bursting into 
flames. The truck's load of 30,000 pounds of rolled wire spread across all 
eight lanes of the freeway, striking two southbound cars, Ehly said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehly said witnesses reported seeing the truck come down the slope with flames 
streaming behind it, apparently from its burning brakes. He said its driver, 
Antonio Ramos, 22, of San Jose, could not use the northbound freeway escape 
ramp, which allows runaway trucks to come to a stop by gliding up a steep ramp, 
because a motor home that had lost its brakes was already there. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalee McIntyre, 42, of Paso Robles was killed when the truck smashed her car, 
officials said. Ramos and Kathi Randal, 28, of Modesto, a passenger in the 
U-Haul truck, were treated for serious injuries at Kern Medical Center in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of the U-Haul and the cars hit by the debris were not injured, Ehly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All lanes of the freeway were closed for an hour, when the CHP began opening 
the southbound lanes. The northbound lanes remained closed until two were 
opened about 1 a.m. Friday. The remaining two were opened at 6:45 a.m.

BEARS TRADE MCMAHON TO CHARGERS;

CHICAGO GETS CONDITIONAL DRAFT PICK, END TO DITKA FEUD

Quarterback Jim McMahon, whose feud with Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka 
overshadowed his on-field exploits in recent seasons, was traded Friday to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be in uniform for the Chargers' exhibition game against the 
Bears in Chicago on Saturday night, but it is doubtful he will play. 
</P>
<P>
"Ditka and I didn't speak at all during training camp, and I figured something 
was going on," McMahon said. "And I guess I was right. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very relieved. . . . I feel sorry for the rest of the guys who've got to 
put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, who will turn 30 on Monday, was competing with Mike Tomczak and Jim 
Harbaugh for the Bears' starting quarterback job this season after being 
plagued by injuries for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
He completed four of six passes for 47 yards in the Bears' 28-20 exhibition 
victory over Miami on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to go with the young quarterbacks. Jim McMahon is a starting 
quarterback and I couldn't give him that guarantee," Ditka said. "It was a 
tough decision. I don't like to make those decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say things had soured, but this was a perfect fit. They needed a 
starting quarterback and it's an ideal situation for Jim. We'll find out if 
it's ideal for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears' compensation is conditional, depending on the success of McMahon and 
the Chargers. It could be as high as a first-round pick in the 1990 draft or as 
low as a third-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon cleared his locker early Friday after talking briefly with Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
He said the coach told him: "We made a deal. We appreciate all you have done 
for us in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
It was with McMahon at quarterback and Ditka as coach that the Bears won five 
consecutive NFC Central Division titles and the Super Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Ditka believes he can win with anybody," McMahon said. "Look at the 
trades that have happened over the last couple of years -- getting rid of the 
likes of Wilber Marshall, Willie Gault, Mike Richardson, Otis Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks his coaching gets it done; now I don't have to deal with that 
anymore. I'm relieved." 
</P>
<P>
An indication that a trade my occur came when Ditka started Tomczak in last 
Monday's exhibition with Miami and then said Harbaugh would start against San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka said the trade simplified matters for the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have two guys competing for the starting job instead of three. Yes, he 
could have been our starting quarterback. I've proclaimed all along that any 
one of the three could start. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is he needs a change of scenery, a new coach," Ditka said. "I think 
he'll be happier. His health is fine." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka said the thing he will remember most about McMahon is the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
"He backed up everything he said about the Super Bowl and went out and did it," 
Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have sought a quarterback since Dan Fouts retired before last 
season. Their quarterbacks -- Mark Malone, free agent David Archer and 
second-round draft pick Billy Joe Tolliver -- were ineffective in a 20-3 
preseason loss to Dallas last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon said Coach Dan Henning told him he wouldn't play Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"But I told him I do want to get involved with the team right away. I probably 
will dress. . . . Maybe I'll sneak my way in there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears drafted McMahon in 1982 out of Brigham Young University, where he set 
71 collegiate passing records. McMahon became the first quarterback the Bears 
had selected in the first round since Bob Williams of Notre Dame in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon was benched for two games during the middle of the 1983 season but 
after that he started every game when he was healthy. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon had a 49-17 overall record as a starter and was 35-3 in his 38 
regular-season games since the 1984 season. 
</P>
<P>
He was, however, prone to injury. In the 11th game in 1984 he suffered kidney 
lacerations against the Raiders and missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He missed three games in the middle of 1985 but came back and led the Bears to 
a 46-10 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots. He missed nine games 
in 1986, including a playoff loss to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon played only seven games in 1987 because of various injuries but started 
the playoff game against Washington in a 21-17 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he suffered a knee injury in the 10th game and was out until the 
playoffs. He did not start, but played late in the 20-12 fog-shrouded playoff 
against Philadelphia and started in the 28-3 loss to San Francisco for the NFC 
championship.

GETTING RYAN HAS PAID OFF FOR RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN A. BOLT, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

ARLINGTON, Texas 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Lovett, sporting a Nolan Ryan T-shirt, was in a hurry to watch the famed 
fastball flinger set more records, but the 14-year-old Texas Rangers fan agreed 
to stop for a second. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he like Ryan? 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he's old, he's still great," Lovett said about the 42-year-old 
strikeout king. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers general manager Tom Grieve couldn't agree more, as he has watched the 
cash registers at Arlington Stadium ring up an estimated $1.25 million in 
additional sales directly attributed to Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been actually too good to be true. In every area it's been better than 
even we would have imagined," said Grieve, who paid Ryan $200,000 last December 
to sign a $1.6 million, one-year contract with the American League team. With 
incentives and an option year, the total contract tops $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the Texas-born Ryan were easy, Grieve said. "We said, 'Here's 
a contract. Tell us how much it'll take to sign you."' Ryan went with Texas, 
even though he had higher offers, because he wanted to remain near his hometown 
of Alvin, located near Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Grieve signed Ryan after the Houston Astros decided the price was too high, 
angering many hometown fans, including the Murphy family, which recently drove 
the 250 miles from Houston to watch their favorite player pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just really what baseball's all about," said Joe Murphy, citing Ryan's 
off-field generosity as well as his on-field triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has won 286 games, including 13 this year, and is the oldest pitcher still 
throwing in the majors. His 95 mph fast ball remains too much for even the best 
hitters to hit consistently. 
</P>
<P>
He is also on the verge of striking out his 5,000th batter and holds 41 Major 
League records. The closest pitcher to Ryan is Steve Carlton, who struck out 
4,136 before retiring last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Lovetts and Murphys were in the crowd of 35,226 recently when Ryan struck 
out 13 Detroit Tigers as he came within two outs of his sixth career no-hitter. 
No one else has more than four. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fourth time this year he's almost done it," majority owner George 
W. Bush said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"To have a Texas hero like Nolan Ryan bring a no-hitter into the ninth inning 
before a full house, this is the best that there is," the president's son said. 
</P>
<P>
"We signed Nolan Ryan because we needed a starting pitcher and we felt he was 
an excellent starting pitcher and could help our staff," Grieve said. "He's a 
boost at the gate every time he pitches, but the bottom line is (we signed him) 
because he was a very good pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
He also has had a significant impact on that other bottom line -- the one that 
counts dollar and cents. 
</P>
<P>
While the Rangers have benefited from increased interest in baseball generally, 
ticket operations manager John Schriever said Ryan still brings out an 
additional 5,000 to 6,000 people each home game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I did the (attendance) projection a week ago," for the Aug. 10 game 
against the Tigers, "I only projected 29,000 to 30,000," Schriever said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to change that to 34,000 to 36,000 when I found out Ryan was pitching," 
he said. Attendance has averaged 28,363 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen starts at home, times 6,000 at eight bucks equals $768,000, plus $5 
per head on concessions, that's $1.25 million for home games," Schriever said, 
punching his calculator. 
</P>
<P>
Season ticket sales were up 1,200, about half because of Ryan, Schriever said, 
bringing in another $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although 20 percent of the gate goes to visiting teams, the Rangers get the 
same deal and, "on the road he does real well, too," Schriever said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, with Ryan just 14 strikeouts away from 5,000, and scheduled to 
pitch in an mid-afternoon game in Seattle last week -- hardly a prime baseball 
time -- more than 20,000 people were in the Kingdome, where attendance has 
averaged 16,642 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Texas, where Ryan is scheduled to start Tuesday against Oakland, and 
where odds are he'll get that 5,000th strikeout, it was already "general 
admission only" early last week, with an advance sale of 26,000, more than 
10,000 higher than the next night. 
</P>
<P>
With advance sales figured in, the Rangers are guaranteed of breaking their 
previous attendance record of 1.76 million for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in a lot of places want to see Nolan Ryan ... want to say, 'I 
saw Nolan Ryan's 5000th strikeout,"' Grieve said. 
</P>
<P>
They also bring their wallets, which get thinner quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ebeier, who runs a concession stand behind home plate, said Ryan 
T-shirts, at $14.50 each, and posters, which fetch $5, are hot sellers -- 
especially after a particularly stirring performance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to spending at the ball park, the Rangers' radio broadcasts have 
brought increased participation, both from listeners and advertisers 
</P>
<P>
Chris Leiss, sports marketing director for WBAP, the Fort Worth station that 
originates the Rangers broadcasts, said advertising revenue is up about 30 
percent, "a significant amount of it due to Nolan Ryan." At least one 
advertiser is on only when Ryan pitches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ranger audience also has increased about 20 percent, he said, and is 
highest when Ryan is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
The Ranger network is larger this year, adding about six stations, with two or 
three signing up because of Ryan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took off ever since the day we signed him," Leiss said. 
</P>
<P>
One station in particular, KSEV in Houston, joined because of Ryan, who pitched 
for the hometown Astros for nine years. It is the first time the Rangers have 
had an outlet in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Grieve has no second thoughts about making Ryan the highest-paid Ranger, "by a 
significant gap," despite a season shortened last year by a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
"This signing couldn't have turned out any better in our minds," Grieve said. 
"Nolan has done everything and more probably, if it's possible, because we had 
high expectations to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Grieve said there is no doubt the team will pick up the option to pay $1.4 
million for another Ryan year, and will await his decision on whether he'll 
pitch a 24th season. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully he'll stay around for his 300th win next year," Bush said. "He's the 
epitome of baseball. Whatever he wants to do is fine with us, in any capacity."

Jose Canseco of the Oakland A's apparently has plea-bargained his way out of a 
misdemeanor weapons violation and will plead no contest Aug. 31, in exchange 
for probation and a promise to perform community service, attorney Robert 
Shapiro of Los Angeles indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, 24, was arrested by police at the University of California at San 
Francisco on April 21 after a passer-by noticed a fully loaded, semi-automatic 
pistol on the floor of his parked Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said that Canseco was unaware of the state's gun possession laws and 
will perform services such as conducting an autograph session at a hospital or 
taking underprivileged children to a game.

Janet Evans, a triple gold-medal winner in the Seoul Olympics, scored two 
victories Friday as the United States continued to dominate the Pan Pacific 
Swimming Championships at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Evans won the women's 400-meter individual medley in meet-record time, then 
pushed the 800-meter freestyle relay team to a meet-record victory. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, the U.S. team won six of nine events in the 
50-meter Yoyogi National Olympic swimming pool. Australia, China and Canada 
each won one race. 
</P>
<P>
In the 400-meter individual medley, Evans took the lead after 100 meters and 
easily won in 4 minutes 39.38 seconds for her 20th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, representing the Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team, finished about 10 meters 
ahead of China's Lin Li, who was timed in 4:45.69. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Evans teamed with Mitzi Kremer, Stacy Cassiday and Julie 
Kole to win the relay in 8:03.33, more than three seconds better than the 
former meet mark. Japan was second in 8:14.83, followed by Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really satisfied with my strokes today," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
American Richard Korhammer was a winner for the second time in two days, taking 
the 100-meter breaststroke in 1:02.95.

HOUSTON FANS REMEMBER RYAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each time Nolan Ryan flirts with his sixth no-hitter or reaches another career 
milestone, Houston Astros fans remember. 
</P>
<P>
They remember that Ryan pitched his fifth no-hitter in the Astrodome and that 
he became the all-time strikeout leader in an Astros uniform. 
</P>
<P>
And they remember that when Ryan's contract expired last season, he initially 
was offered a decrease in pay and later signed with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, homegrown in nearby Alvin, pitched nine memorable seasons with the 
Astros, helping them to two National League Western Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to end his career in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ryan records his 5,000th career strikeout, it will be with another 
Texas team -- the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
And Astros fans remember. 
</P>
<P>
"Everytime he does something outstanding, it's like re-opening an old wound," 
Astros fan Lyn Johnston of League City said. "It's like pouring a little more 
salt on it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he's followed Ryan's career since he was a child and had 
considered buying season tickets until Ryan's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Now he sees nine or 10 games per season and still hears the bitterness over the 
loss of Ryan, even though the Astros have been near the top of the NL's Western 
Division all season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Astros made a big mistake and by now I think (Astros owner John) 
McMullen realizes it," Johnson said. "If there was any way I could be sitting 
on the front row when he makes that 5,000th strikeout, I'd be there." 
</P>
<P>
The Astros initially offered Ryan a contract worth $800,000 when his $1 million 
per year deal expired last season. 
</P>
<P>
When Ryan balked and started entertaining offers from other teams, a bidding 
war ensued. 
</P>
<P>
California owner Gene Autry offered $3.2 million over two years to get Ryan 
back on the team where he pitched for eight seasons and San Francisco 
reportedly offered a two-year package worth $3.2 million, $1.8 million of it 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
But Ryan didn't want to leave his home state, and signed a 2-year contract with 
the Rangers for $3.2 million. He is guaranteed $2 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros finally made Ryan a one-year offer of $1.3 million with no 
incentives or bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"Stupid, that's all you can call it," said Ben Young of San Antonio. "Even if 
he wasn't pitching as well as he once did, you don't let someone like a Hall of 
Famer get away. It was sad to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's Astros teammates were as unhappy as the fans and now track his successes 
with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep up with him the best I can," Astros second baseman Bill Doran said. 
"Everyone in the Astros organization wish nothing but the best for him." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's success with the Rangers is a touchy subject with Astros management, 
keenly aware of their unpopular decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised at what he is doing," Astros general manager Bill Wood said. 
"We never purported in any way, shape or form that the man couldn't pitch. 
Ours' was a business disagreement." 
</P>
<P>
Owner McMullen won't discuss the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Art Howe, in his first season as Astros manager and a former teammate of 
Ryan's, never got a chance to pencil him into the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros signed free agents Jim Clancy and Rick Rhoden to fill the void. 
Rhoden spent almost three months on the disabled list and Clancy has been 
ineffective much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a season of pitching injuries, Howe says he doesn't consider the 
possibility of Ryan in his rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"That never crosses my mind, besides, you can't say he would be doing the same 
thing here," Howe said. "He went over there with something to prove and he's 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy for the Rangers because they are my former team. I'm happy for 
Nolan, too. He'll get the 5,000." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati manager Pete Rose, who hit and managed against Ryan, also is happy, 
happy that Ryan is in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a physical freak," Rose said admiringly. "It's a credit to how well he 
takes care of himself in the off season. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a kick out of guys who say he shouldn't be in the Hall of Fame. If Nolan 
Ryan isn't in the Hall of Fame, there shouldn't be a Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
"People who say he doesn't belong there are the same people who wouldn't put 
syrup on their ice cream."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
BLUE JAY NEWCOMER GOZZO DOWNS ORIOLES FOR THIRD STRAIGHT WIN, 9-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1984, the Toronto Blue Jays have been the team to beat in the American 
League East. Each time they have been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
This season, a 6-foot-3 rookie right-hander may be just the person to enable 
the Blue Jays to win a division title, at last. 
</P>
<P>
Mauro Gozzo, 23, hampered by tendinitis in his right shoulder for two years, 
won his third game in a row Friday night when the Blue Jays beat the Orioles, 
9-2, at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
In his third major league start, Gozzo gave up eight hits and both Oriole runs 
in seven innings. He has pitched 20 innings for the Blue Jays and has given up 
only three earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell and two more Toronto newcomers, Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson, hit 
home runs off 29-year-old Baltimore rookie Dave Johnson (2-2). The loss cut the 
Orioles' lead to a half-game over Milwaukee and 1 1/2 over the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Gozzo, whose father is an immigrant from Sicily, was a prep star in Berlin, 
Conn. He turned down college football scholarships to sign, as a 13th-round 
draft pick, with the New York Mets in 1984. Three years later, the Mets traded 
catcher Ed Hearn and Gozzo to Kansas City for David Cone, probably the Mets' 
best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
With Gozzo's tendinitis problem, the Royals didn't protect him in the 
off-season, and the Blue Jays snapped him up. 
</P>
<P>
Gozzo realized his potential in a hurry this season. He began at Knoxville, 
Tenn., in Double-A and posted a 7-0 record. He was moved up to Syracuse, N.Y., 
in Triple-A. When he was 5-1 there, the Blue Jays beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's home run was his first of the season, and Mazzilli's was his third. 
Both players came to Toronto from the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly enough of us new guys," Gozzo said. "I'm just glad to 
finally get a chance to contribute. Maz has helped a lot, and Mookie has been a 
spark. Remember, we had some good players to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, mired in a slump most of the season, hit his 13th home run, a double and 
two singles, and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 7, New York 3 -- New Yankee Manager Bucky Dent may be wondering what he 
let himself in for. 
</P>
<P>
In his debut, the Yankees were in Detroit to face the weakest team in the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers had six runs and four home runs in four innings and breezed to 
victory behind Jeff Robinson (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
After just five Tigers had batted, Dent's team was down, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chet Lemon and Kenny Williams hit two-run homers off Chuck Cary, while Gary 
Ward and Rick Shu hit solo shots. Dave Bergman connected off Eric Plunk in the 
sixth, giving the Tigers five in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, Boston 2 -- Billy Spiers' two-run single capped a four-run first 
inning at Milwaukee that enabled the streaking Brewers to win their eighth in a 
row and close within a half-game of the East-leading Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
B. J. Surhoff was 3 for 3 as the Brewers handed the fading Red Sox their sixth 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up 10 hits in five innings, Tom Filer improved to 4-1. Bill 
Krueger, released by the Dodgers in spring training, pitched four perfect 
innings of relief, striking out six. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Seattle 1 -- Before anyone gives the title in the West to either 
the Angels or Oakland, watch out for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
And before the rookie award is handed out, watch out for Tom Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon is just about the hottest pitcher in the majors. The converted reliever 
held the Mariners to two hits in eight innings and struck out 10 at Seattle, 
improving his record to 15-4. He has won four starts in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Eisenreich and Frank White hit home runs as the Royals moved within 4 1/2 
games of first place. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since their 1985 championship season, the Royals are 15 
games above .500. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Oakland 3 -- The Twins spoiled Dave Stewart's bid for his 17th 
victory early at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gaetti hit a two-run home run in a four-run first inning that gave Roy 
Smith (9-4) all the cushion he needed. Stewart, put in an early hole by 
shortstop Walt Weiss' error on leadoff batter Wally Backman, settled down 
thereafter but fell to 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon pitched the ninth, giving up the final Oakland run, to earn his 
23rd save. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who yielded two runs (only one earned) in eight innings, won his fifth 
game in a row and gave the Twins a 5-2 record against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Chicago 5 -- Steve Buechele and Ruben Sierra emerged from deep slumps 
at Chicago to lead the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Buechele was 7 for 48 when he hit a three-run home run in the sixth inning. 
Five of his last 12 hits have been homers. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra was 7 for 59 going into the game and had two singles. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

REUSCHEL RETURNS, BUOYS GIANTS' SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants have had more than their share of bad luck with 
injuries to pitchers, including the tragic broken arm of Dave Dravecky. 
</P>
<P>
But the key players on offense, Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell, have been 
relatively healthy. They're two reasons why the Giants have a three-game lead 
in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who hasn't missed a game, hit a three-run home run to help Rick Reuschel 
return from the disabled list with a 5-2 victory over the Phillies Friday night 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, out since July 29 because of a groin injury, needed all the help he 
could get. The 40-year-old right-hander improved to 14-5 but gave up both runs 
and eight hits in six innings. Craig Lefferts and Steve Bedrosian finished. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 20th home run for Clark, who also had a double and a single to 
increase his average to .345, best in the major leagues. With 90 runs batted 
in, Clark is second only to Mitchell, who has missed five games but has 39 home 
runs and 105 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Clark isn't concerned about a batting title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm caught up right now with the pennant race, not the batting race," Clark 
said. "I'm feeling good at the plate and just want to help us win." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, by far the best home team in the league, are 3-1 on this trip. They 
will have 22 home games and only 13 road games left when they return home next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
If they can stay in front by three or four on the road, they figure to be tough 
to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they will be without Dravecky, whose arm broke while he was making a 
pitch Tuesday night at Montreal, for the rest of the season. That injury gave 
special significance to Reuschel's return. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reasonably sharp," Reuschel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no pain. I could have pitched to some more hitters. I'm happy with the 
results." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Williams, who has been a third power hitter for the Giants lately, hit his 
10th home run in the fifth inning. In the last nine games, Williams has hit six 
home runs and driven in 14 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, San Diego 2 -- When the Expos needed somebody to pick them up and 
keep them in the race in the East, Pascual Perez came through. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran right-hander, a disappointment most of the season, pitched a 
six-hitter, struck out seven and laid down a squeeze bunt to score the go-ahead 
run at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the Expos' fourth victory in their last 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
"A game like this is the kind we have to win," said Perez (7-12). "We don't 
have to get 12 hits or five homers, but we have to do the little things we do 
well. That's why I practice bunting so much." 
</P>
<P>
Houston 6, Chicago 5 -- When the Cubs built a 5-0 lead in the fourth inning at 
Houston, it appeared that the Astros would drop four games behind the Giants in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Walton singled in the third to extend his hitting streak to 28 games, 
tying the club record set by Ron Santo in 1966. He scored a run and drove in 
one as the Cubs surged ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros battled back. They pulled within a run when Glenn Davis hit his 29th 
home run of the season, a two-run shot in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles by Bill Doran and Davis tied the score in the ninth. With runners on 
first and second and two out, Jeff Pico gave an intentional walk to Harry 
Spilman to load the bases, then an unintentional walk to Rafael Ramirez to end 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' lead in the East was cut to 3 1/2 games over New York. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 6-8, St. Louis 2-3 -- Todd Benzinger hit a grand slam in the eighth 
inning off Cardinal reliever Todd Worrell in the nightcap, after Tom Browning 
overcame three rain delays totaling 2 1/2 hours in the opener to pitch a 
five-hitter for his fifth straight win. 
</P>
<P>
The second game had another rain delay of 34 minutes in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Benzinger hit two homers, a triple, a double and a single in eight at-bats and 
drove in seven runs in the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Eric Davis hit his 27th homer of the season and his eighth 
in his last 14 games for a 3-2 Red lead in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 13, Pittsburgh 6 -- Darrell Evans hit his 414th home run, and Lonnie 
Smith, coming back strong after a day of rest, led the Braves' 15-hit attack at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had three singles, scored a run and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 42, hit his 11th home run of the season in a four-run first inning that 
matched the Pirates' first inning off Tom Glavine. But Glavine lasted into the 
sixth inning and improved to 12-6. DAN HAFNER

COMMUNICATION GAP;

<P>
CULTURE SHOCK HITS HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican mother worries because the doctor issued a diagnosis for her baby 
without ever touching the child. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese patient believes that the doctor's office staff is angry because 
of the atmosphere of brisk efficiency rather than welcoming politeness. 
</P>
<P>
The elderly Korean woman's family blames her stroke on nurses and doctors who 
upset her inner balance by treating her carelessly and then not noticing her 
quiet anger. 
</P>
<P>
Such misunderstandings are becoming more common in Los Angeles and the rest of 
the nation as the United States rushes toward broader ethnic diversity. 
Cultural information gaps can develop into huge gulfs that prevent doctors from 
giving and their patients from getting the best possible medical care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Communication' 
</P>
<P>
"You can't practice good medicine without good communication, and you can't 
have good communication unless there is some understanding of the patient's 
world view," said Sylvia Drew Ivie, executive director of the T.H.E. Clinic for 
Women, which serves a multi-ethnic clientele in the Crenshaw district of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get the facts to diagnose the medical problem and you can't get the 
trust and cooperation you need from the patient." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, cultural barriers to conventional medical care are part of the reason 
that Latinos provide a willing clientele for unlicensed medical facilities 
throughout Southern California, said Ellen Pais, a deputy city attorney in Los 
Angeles who prosecutes unlicensed providers. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 30, Pais is to begin trial in Los Angeles Municipal Court of some of 
the principals in a ring of allegedly bogus L.A. medical clinics, raided in 
June and accused of illegally serving 1,000 patients a week, most of them 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Main Roadblocks 
</P>
<P>
Pais and others involved in health care say the main roadblocks to good medical 
care for minorities are lack of money, health insurance and education, problems 
that are more likely to affect them than non-minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
But even when free or low-cost health care is available, more subtle cultural 
barriers can make it harder for them to receive the full benefit of that care: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recent immigrants have health beliefs and medical expectations that can 
differ markedly from those of the dominant American medical system. These range 
from a Chinese traditionalist's view of antibiotics as too powerful to some 
groups' preferences for birth control methods that are regarded as unwise or 
unsafe in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The brusqueness of American medicine can alienate patients who come from 
cultures with strong customs regulating interactions between people. For 
instance, Latinas are put off if a medical visit doesn't begin with chitchat, 
but Asians seek formal politeness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accepted patterns of health behavior in a minority culture may be at odds 
with the American medical norm. So, a doctor who chastises someone for using a 
folk remedy or delaying medical care is both attacking the patient's culture 
and wasting a chance to gently educate him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Intimidated by a medical system modeled on middle-class values and 
education, immigrants and the poor tend to be more passive about their approach 
to health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem with such generalizations about minorities and medical 
care is that they are generalizations, those who have worked in the field say. 
Groups differ from each other, and so do individuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picture Not So Clear 
</P>
<P>
Take language. It is self-evident that someone who doesn't speak English at all 
needs to have a bilingual health facility or one with interpreters. But for 
someone who learned English as a second language, the picture is not so clear. 
</P>
<P>
At Ivie's nonprofit private clinic, she said, Latino patients frequently will 
not talk openly with or ask questions of an Anglo, even if that person is 
bilingual, because "they don't want to impose," Ivie said. 
</P>
<P>
Thai clients generally want a Thai speaker, she said. Japanese, though, seem to 
prefer to interact with native English speakers, to demonstrate their 
proficiency in the language. And Korean women seeking gynecological help do not 
want a Korean health care worker, because they fear communication of private 
sexual matters within the close-knit Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
Given this wide variety of reactions, the best approach health professionals 
can take to minorities is to have an open mind, said Susan Scrimshaw, a medical 
anthropologist at UCLA's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value Judgments 
</P>
<P>
"I spend all my time trying to explain people to doctors," Scrimshaw said. "I 
spend a lot of my time trying to get people away from value judgments." 
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that Americans often look down on other cultures' health values 
but ignore the fact that the dominant American culture has beliefs of its own, 
not all of them rational: the superiority of brown sugar and bread and the 
power of orange juice, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Yet something as simple as the belief in orange juice becomes problematic in 
the face of the widespread folk medicine practice of balancing "hot" and "cold" 
in the body. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos often believe, for instance, that someone with a fever should never be 
given cold liquids because it shocks the body. 
</P>
<P>
"If a baby has a cold and you tell the mother to give the baby lots of juice, 
that is completely violating the hot and cold," Scrimshaw said. "It's simpler 
just to say give the baby liquids, and if it's a warm liquid like chicken soup 
then it's all right -- because all you care about is getting liquids in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Advice 
</P>
<P>
This kind of cultural flexibility makes it easier to get minority patients' 
attention on advice that is more crucial, such as avoiding specific folk 
remedies that contain toxic ingredients or complying with special diets, 
Scrimshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
The keys for health care workers are awareness and time, said Barbara 
Pillsbury, a medical anthropologist in Malibu who consults for a variety of 
international health agencies on Asian programs.

"Part of the reason that doctors and nurses are not as culturally sensitive as 
they could be or should be is because of their own insensitivity in many cases 
to cultural differences," Pillsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"And in other cases it is because they are so pressed by time and all those 
other constraints," she said. "Even if that physician is culturally sensitive, 
he may not have the time to sit down and do what is required to overcome those 
cultural barriers." 
</P>
<P>
She advises doctors to ask very specific questions of their Asian patients, 
repeating them in several different ways; to sit down to reduce the status 
difference between patient and doctor, and to approach a family member, not the 
patient, when there seem to be problems, thus allowing the patient to save 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Among poor blacks, Ivie said, health care workers must remember that even 
though blacks do not face the same language or cultural barriers of immigrants, 
they commonly have serious problems finding medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"Often there has been so much difficulty working through the system that a 
patient will come in who assumes she is not going to be treated well," Ivie 
said. "There needs to be an awareness that hostility is not really a set 
opinion but a defensive posture." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the nation's two biggest minority groups, blacks and Latinos, have 
higher incidence of chronic diseases and their complications than do Anglos. 
Hypertension, coronary heart disease, certain types of cancer, diabetes and 
stroke are higher for them than the rest of the population. For example, blacks 
are twice as likely as Anglos to die of stroke, and the diabetes rate among 
Latinos is three times that of Anglos, according to federal figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignoring Early Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
Poverty is seen as one direct reason for the disparity. But observers say that 
ignoring early symptoms of ill health can also be part of a community norm that 
doctors must recognize, even as they try to change it. 
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be an appreciation that culturally there is not a whole history 
of preventive attention to health care, that it's much more of a crisis 
approach, so you're going to get black patients more at the end of the course 
of whatever it is, rather than at the beginning," Ivie said. "But there also 
needs to be no judgment. Because if in fact that is the pattern in a wide 
proportion of the community, then it's insensitive to scold a person as though 
they're the aberrant one when that is the pattern." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Lewis, a UCLA adjunct professor of medicine and nursing, points to her 
experience in studying how to train Latino children to recognize the signs of 
asthma attacks. Before the study could begin, she said, researchers had to 
persuade the children that wheezing wasn't normal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To Them That's Normal' 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have wheezed most of their lives, so to them that's normal. Because 
they had never had any good relief, they had no perception of what really 
feeling good means," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a member of the California Hispanic American Medical Assn., 
said she believes that even educated Latinos whose families have been in the 
United States for generations put off getting medical care because they are not 
really reached by health education materials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only the language, it's how they receive the messages," Lifshitz 
said. "For the most part I would say that Latinos respond better to messages 
that are given in a language of feeling rather than the detached language of 
science. So a lot of times though the message is there and the language is 
there it does not really reach Hispanics in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, health messages won't get through if there is no recognition of the 
need for light conversation with Latinas, or if the doctor is unaware of their 
feeling that a physician must touch the patient to make an accurate diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
As Scrimshaw tries to make health professionals more sensitive to such subtle 
issues, she said, she finds herself amazed at the notion that some of these 
things have to be taught at all. 
</P>
<P>
"In Latino culture, you have worth independent of your education and your 
income. You respect the doctor for his education and his knowledge, but the 
doctor should respect you for what you are," she said. "If the doctor talks 
down to you or scolds you in front of other patients, that violates your 
dignity and then you lose respect for the doctor. And that happens all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"So one of the things I try to work with the doctors on is the concept of human 
dignity and worth, and that human beings treat each other with respect."

JULY PRICES UP ONLY 0.2% AS ECONOMY COOLS 
</P>

<P>
Inflation continued at a moderate pace in July, the government reported Friday, 
with consumer prices rising only 0.2% for the second month in a row -- the best 
two-month performance since mid-1986. 
</P>
<P>
The recent trend, evident in almost all categories of goods and services except 
entertainment and medical costs, indicated that the price pressures that 
sparked fears of renewed inflation earlier this year have abated. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Kottman, an analyst with the Georgia State University economic 
forecasting service, said that the recent cooling of the economy -- in response 
to the Federal Reserve Board's effort beginning last year to increase interest 
rates -- has dampened inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole economy is backing off a bit" from its previous pace, which came 
dangerously close to causing it to overheat, Kottman said. "We expect continued 
moderation on the inflation front in the months to come." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication of what impact the figures might have on the 
willingness of the Federal Reserve Board to ease up further on interest rates, 
which have been falling for two months. The White House has been pushing for 
such a move, but the Fed has held firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration contended that the figures show the overall inflation 
picture to be improving markedly. In Kennebunkport, Me., where President Bush 
is on vacation, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater declared that 
"inflation is on a downward trend." 
</P>
<P>
But Joel Popkin, a Washington economist who specializes in inflation, warned 
that the respite is "nothing more than a summer lull" stemming from an easing 
of energy and food prices and a rise in the value of the dollar, which reduces 
the cost of imports. 
</P>
<P>
Popkin noted that prices of services are still rising sharply and predicted 
that inflation will accelerate again in early autumn, when manufacturers 
introduce new product lines in everything from apparel to automobiles. "I 
expect that by fall we'll be back to a core inflation rate of 5%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He speculated also that the Fed may have eased up too early in its moves to 
avert a recession after raising interest rates last year. It probably 
succeeded, Popkin said, "but, as a result, it has precluded the opportunity" to 
drive inflation down. 
</P>
<P>
The price moderation in July was abetted by sharp declines in apparel and 
transportation prices, reflecting larger-than-usual end-of-season price cuts 
for women's clothes and a steep 2.2% falloff in gasoline prices. Prices of new 
autos and new-car financing also fell markedly. 
</P>
<P>
However, medical prices soared 0.7% in July to a point about 7.5% above their 
level of a year ago. The index for medical care services rose 0.9% in July, and 
the cost of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals rose 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment costs also rose sharply during the month, with ticket prices for 
movies, theaters and musical events jumping 1.3%. The index for other goods and 
services rose 0.9% in July, after a 0.8% rise in June. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate calculation, the department reported that consumer prices in the 
Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside area rose 0.2% in July, down from a 0.3% rise in 
June. The indexes for individual cities traditionally are very volatile. 
</P>
<P>
July's increase brought the national consumer price index to a new level of 
124.4% of its 1982-1984 average, meaning that it took $12.44 to buy the same 
goods and services at retail last month that had cost $10 during the first part 
of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of 1989, inflation has advanced at an annual rate 
of 5.5% -- conspicuously high by historical standards. During the year that 
ended in July, consumer prices rose 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's report showed that the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers jumped 
1.5% in July, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors, after a scant 
0.1% increase in June. Over the last 12 months, wages -- adjusted for inflation 
-- have fallen by 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The June-July respite in price increases followed a five-month-long surge in 
oil and food prices. The spurt ended in late May as oil prices moderated and 
farm prices slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
But Popkin cautioned that, although the weakening in the economy may help ease 
inflationary pressures, it will also slow any improvement of productivity, a 
result that will push labor costs higher and squeeze business profit margins, 
thus crimping investment. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, he said, "it could create a recession."

AIR CRASH TAPE DISPLAYS CALM DURING ORDEAL

<P>
One minute before crippled United Airlines Flight 232 cartwheeled down a runway 
of the airport in Sioux City, Iowa, air traffic controller Kevin Bachman told 
the pilots that they were clear to land on any runway. 
</P>
<P>
Laughing, a pilot answered: "You want to be particular and make it a runway, 
huh?" 
</P>
<P>
That rare moment of humor in the tension-filled minutes leading up to the July 
19 crash of the DC-10 was disclosed Friday in a tape of conversations between 
air traffic controllers and the United cockpit released by the Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The tape demonstrates the calm professionalism of Bachman and the United 
pilots, who had lost their plane's steering mechanism when its tail engine 
exploded while the plane was en route from Denver to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bachman and United Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, 57, and his crew have been 
widely praised for their efforts to control the crippled DC-10, which broke up 
shortly after landing, killing 111 of the 296 persons on board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Finished Training 
</P>
<P>
Bachman, 27, said at a press conference Friday that he has been a fully 
qualified FAA controller for only three months, after training for almost two 
years in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
At no time during the ordeal did the voices of Bachman or the pilots in the 
cockpit betray panic or fear. 
</P>
<P>
"You just concentrate," Bachman said. "You don't even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by missing parts, the National Safety Transportation Board has yet to 
determine why the engine exploded. The explosion destroyed the plane's 
hydraulic system, which controlled its wing flaps, ailerons, elevators, rudder 
and other basic components. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contact for 37 Minutes 
</P>
<P>
Bachman received ground contact with the plane 37 minutes before it crashed. 
The cockpit immediately informed him: 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so you know, we have almost no control ability, very little elevator and 
almost no aileron. We are controlling the turns by power. I don't think we can 
turn right but I think we can only make left turns . . . I mean we can only 
turn right but we can't turn left." 
</P>
<P>
"United 232 Heavy, understand sir, you can only make right turns?" Bachman 
asked. ("Heavy" is a code word for wide-bodied aircraft.) 
</P>
<P>
"That's affirmative," the cockpit responded. 
</P>
<P>
Bachman set the plane on a path for Sioux Gateway Airport. Six minutes later, 
one of the pilots calmly informed Bachman of the devasting scope of the plane's 
emergency: 
</P>
<P>
"We have no hydraulic fluid . . . . I have serious doubts about making the 
airport. Have you got some place near there that we might be able to ditch? 
Unless we get control of this airplane, we're going to put it down wherever it 
happens to be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steering in Circles 
</P>
<P>
For next 30 minutes, the flight's crew struggled to put the plane on a course 
toward the airport, steering the plane in circles while it was rapidly 
descending at a rate of 500 feet a minute. Investigators have said the pilots 
steered the plane by alternating power to the two remaining engines. 
</P>
<P>
In one tense exchange, Bachman asked the flight crew if they could hold their 
present heading. "Where is the airport now for 232 as we're turning around in 
circles?" the cockpit asked. 
</P>
<P>
"United 232 Heavy say again?" said Bachman. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the airport for us now as we come spinning down here." 
</P>
<P>
"United 232 Heavy, Sioux City Airport is about 12 o'clock and three-six miles," 
Bachman responded. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, we are trying to go straight. We're not having much luck," the cockpit 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
The plane "was doing great 360s (full circles) out there for 30 minutes or so," 
Bachman said in the press conference. "I knew, whatever I did, I had to keep 
him away from the city." 
</P>
<P>
Bachman began to look for some place the plane could land if it could not reach 
the airport. Among the options he gave the flight crew were numerous small 
airports and a four-lane interstate highway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try for the airport," the cockpit told him. A few seconds 
later, when the crew had the runway in sight, a pilot said matter of factly to 
Bachman: "We'll be with you very shortly. Thanks a lot for your help." 
</P>
<P>
Bachman radioed that the runway was 6,600 feet long. "At the end of the runway, 
it's just a wide open field so, sir, so the length won't be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the shrieks of the horn warning the crew that the plane was close to the 
ground, the last words to come from the cockpit were: "Pull up! Pull up!" -- 
possibly the recorded words of a ground proximity alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Bachman, who could see the plane from the control tower, said at the press 
conference that he turned away when the plane hit the ground, cartwheeling down 
the runway in a ball of flames. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after it happened," he said, "I went downstairs and cried." 
</P>

MAZOWIECKI, A LONGTIME ACTIVIST, EXPECTS FORMAL SELECTION TODAY

<P>
In a dramatic reversal of 45 years of Communist rule in Poland, President 
Wojciech Jaruzelski is expected today to offer the post of prime minister to 
newspaper editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime opposition activist and a key 
Solidarity adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, 62, known as a soft-spoken conciliator among his Solidarity 
colleagues, met for two hours with Jaruzelski on Friday and afterward told 
reporters that he expected a formal offer of the post from the president. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to accept it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no certainty about when the announcement might come, but a 
presidential television message is scheduled for 6 p.m. today, following a 
meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee. Political observers assume 
that Jaruzelski will discuss his move with the party's leadership before making 
it public. 
</P>
<P>
"We had long talks with the president, which were very fundamental, concerning 
all important issues," Mazowiecki said. "I think there will be solutions very 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki (pronounced mah-zoe-vee-ET-skee) spoke in his customarily calm 
manner with a crowd of journalists trailing him through the parliament building 
as he arrived for a meeting with Solidarity's leadership. He was asked when he 
expected to name a government. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew that myself," said the editor of the Weekly Solidarity 
newspaper. "There is great social impatience, but this is to be a government 
formed on a completely new principle, and I need some time." 
</P>
<P>
The new principle is the nearest approach to a parliamentary democracy in 
Eastern Europe since the region was politically colonized by Soviet dictator 
Josef Stalin at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The acceptance by Jaruzelski of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's plan for a 
government led by Solidarity appears to spell the end of another principle 
dearly held by Communists: the leading role of the Communist Party in the 
affairs of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the final nail in the coffin of the leading role of the 
Communist Party," said Janusz Onyskiewicz, the Solidarity spokesman. "This is 
the end of the whole concept." 
</P>
<P>
In Kennebunkport, Me., where President Bush is spending a summer vacation, 
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater held out the possibility that 
greater U.S. assistance for Poland might follow a change in the government 
there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Added U.S. Aid Now 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, he said, "it is really premature" to think about 
increasing U.S. aid to Poland beyond the approximately $100 million that Bush 
pledged during a visit there last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of money to offer," Fitzwater said, referring to the 
federal budget deficit. But, he said, "It is something we would have to 
consider down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond expressing encouragement for a shift to a non-Communist government, as 
officials have done in the past, the White House spokesman declined to comment 
on the prospects for change in Warsaw, saying formal White House reaction would 
await an official announcement there. 
</P>
<P>
Among the parade of Communist officials calling on Jaruzelski on Friday was 
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the new Communist Party chief, who has lately been 
exhorting rank-and-file Communists to respond boldly to what he calls "a 
struggle for power" in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
However, it seemed unlikely that Rakowski or other party hard-liners would be 
able to derail the Mazowiecki nomination. Under Polish law, Jaruzelski, who 
recently stepped aside as Communist Party leader to assume his duties as 
president, must submit his nomination for prime minister to the Sejm, or lower 
house of Parliament, for approval. 
</P>
<P>
With Solidarity's forces in the Parliament augmented by two new coalition 
partners, the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, the election of 
a Solidarity candidate is virtually assured. The Solidarity alliance now 
controls the Sejm by 264 to 196. 
</P>
<P>
It was Walesa and his envoy Jaroslaw Kaszynski, a Solidarity deputy in the 
Sejm, who negotiated the coalition with the United Peasants and the Democrats, 
persuading the two minor parties -- with 103 votes between them -- to abandon a 
40-year-old partnership with the Communists and come over to the Solidarity 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The switch by the two parties was the keystone in Walesa's shrewdly calculated 
drive to back the Communists into a corner with his campaign for a 
Solidarity-led government -- a move he decided on himself, even though his key 
advisers had been saying for months that Solidarity was not ready to form a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting speculation over whether there should be a Solidarity government 
-- and whether Walesa himself, with his enormous prestige in the country, would 
head it -- the designated prime minister, Czeslaw Kiszczak, was unable to 
recruit a Cabinet. He announced Monday that he was ready to give up the 
attempt, which was the point at which Walesa's forces came together. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's comments throughout the last 10 days suggested that he would be 
willing to serve as prime minister, but Solidarity members say it is now clear 
that he had no intention of taking the post. But by keeping open the 
possibility, he ensured that the drive for the coalition would be accepted both 
by Solidarity's Sejm deputies and by the United Peasants and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa met Thursday with Jaruzelski, who accepted Walesa's plan along with his 
choice for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity officials said after the meeting that two other names beside 
Mazowiecki's were mentioned: Jacek Kuron, a blunt-spoken and sometimes 
controversial opposition activist, and Bronislaw Geremek, a cerebral professor 
of medieval history who heads Solidarity's Sejm delegation. But Mazowiecki, 
insiders say, was the choice Walesa conveyed to Jaruzelski. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skilled Mediator 
</P>
<P>
Among Mazowiecki's qualifications for the job, colleagues say, are his skills 
as a mediator and a thoughtful tactician. However, some colleagues say that 
Mazowiecki was more suitable to Walesa than Geremek, whose bolder style and 
ambitions could one day conflict with the Nobel Peace Prize winner's. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki has been a close adviser to Walesa for years, and his credentials as 
an opposition activist are impeccable. Unlike both Kuron and Geremek, who were 
once members of the Communist Party, Mazowiecki, closely associated with the 
Roman Catholic Church, has never been a member of the party. 
</P>
<P>
He joined Solidarity at the outset, circulating a petition among intellectuals 
in support of the shipyard strikers in Gdansk in August, 1980. After the 
martial-law crackdown in 1981, he was jailed for a year. But he was back in the 
shipyard, at Walesa's side, in the strikes of April, 1988, the first walkouts 
by the union since its banning in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"There are huge troubles," Mazowiecki said Friday. "But I believe we can 
overcome them. If I didn't believe, I would never have taken this up. I am a 
believer, and I believe that Providence takes care of us." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had hope that "people will feel things can be better." 
</P>
<P>
History, he said, "has shown in several moments that Poles can strive for new 
solutions, unusual and innovative ones. I hope that such a psychological moment 
is arriving now, that people will feel that there is a situation in which our 
future depends on us."

POLAND'S TOP TWO JOBS 
</P>
<P>
A comparison of powers and duties of president and prime minister: 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT 
</P>
<P>
Office of presidency was restored this year after 37-year absence. Former 
Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski now holds the office. Chosen by 
joint vote of Sejm and Senate, president serves six-year term as head of state 
and may run once for reelection. President also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is commander in chief of armed forces, may declare state of war or state of 
emergency when he judges that security threat exists and may rule for up to 
three months without consent of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Must ratify international agreements; appoints and recalls ambassadors; may 
veto legislation passed by Parliament, subject to two-thirds majority override. 
</P>
<P>
 -- May dissolve Parliament and call new elections in limited circumstances, 
e.g., if Parliament fails to choose government or pass budget within three 
months of being seated, or if Parliament passes laws curtailing president's 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
PRIME MINISTER 
</P>
<P>
Prime minister is head of government, serving for four-year term of Sejm, lower 
house of Parliament, unless recalled by president and voted out of office by 
majority of Sejm. This official is nominated by president and elected by simple 
majority of Sejm. Prime minister also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assembles Cabinet to direct government's activities and runs ministries 
that control Poland's state-sector-dominated economy. Cabinet must be approved 
by lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is responsible for day-to-day actions of government; drafts and proposes 
laws to Parliament, as well as annual budgets and national plans for economy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leads weekly Cabinet meetings and controls all important government 
personnel decisions.

RISING-BIRTHRATES FORECAST HOLDS TROUBLE FOR SCHOOLS

<TEXT>
<P>
Due to increased birthrates, California public school enrollment will increase 
even more sharply than expected over the next 10 years, aggravating an already 
severe shortage of classroom space, new estimates by the state Department of 
Finance show. 
</P>
<P>
The new numbers project an average annual increase of 160,000 pupils in 
kindergarten through 12th grade -- 20,000 more per year than the department's 
population experts were predicting a year ago. Total enrollment is expected to 
increase from about 4.5 million this year to almost 6.1 million in 1998 -- a 
35% jump. 
</P>
<P>
School districts in several Southern California counties will be especially 
hard hit by heavy new enrollment demands, according to the Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County is expected to experience an 89% enrollment increase in the 
next 10 years, San Bernardino 78%, San Diego 46%, Orange County 27%, Ventura 
24% and Los Angeles County 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Some outlying San Diego County school districts are experiencing annual growth 
rates of 10% because of new housing developments -- but the San Diego Unified 
School District expects only a 1% rate of growth this coming school year, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide in San Diego, enrollments have been increasing about 6% annually in 
recent years, said Glen Pierson, assistant superintendent for personnel in the 
county's Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"You only need to drive through Rancho San Diego (in East County) and North 
County to see all the growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials in San Diego County's suburbs -- already overcrowded and 
relying heavily on portable classrooms on playgrounds -- have long anticipated 
continued growth. Voters in Escondido in June approved a $27-million bond issue 
to build new classrooms, and a similar measure will go before voters in the 
Vista Unified School District in November. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson noted that, though school officials monitor new housing construction to 
anticipate student enrollment increases, "We never know for sure how many 
students we'll have until the first week of school when they show up." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is expecting an increase of 61,623 
students in the five-year period ending in 1993-94, which would bring district 
enrollment to an all-time high of 656,425. 
</P>
<P>
The new projections are bad news for school officials, who already face a 
backlog of more than $5 billion in unmet school building needs statewide. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said $1.6 billion in bond issues 
approved by voters last year already has been committed to new school 
construction and that another $3.5 billion is needed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Honig has asked Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders to place a 
$1.5-billion general obligation school bond issue on the June, 1990, ballot and 
another $1.5-billion measure on the November, 1990, ballot. In addition, Honig 
has asked for $500 million in revenue bonds or other new revenue sources to 
finance construction needs between now and June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to keep this building program going," Honig said Friday. "Otherwise, 
we're looking at double sessions in a lot of school districts in a couple of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified Budget Director Henry Jones said the district will need $1 
billion for new and modernized schools by the 1992-93 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance's increased projections were caused by rising 
fertility rates among black and white California women and a continuing high 
rate among Latinas, said Mary Heim, research manager in the department's 
population unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Fertility Rates 
</P>
<P>
In the past, department researchers have studied "trends in total fertility," 
Heim said. This year they looked at racial and ethnic fertility rates and then 
changed their projections because "the mix is changing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last year for which data is available, there were 106.3 live 
births per 1,000 Latinas of child-bearing age (15 to 44), while the rate for 
Asian women was 78.8 per 1,000, for black women it was 78.3 and for white women 
63.5. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1987, the number of live births per 1,000 Latinas remained 
about the same -- 106.4 in 1982, 106.3 in 1987 -- but for black women the 
number jumped from 72.8 births per 1,000 women in 1982 to 78.3 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For white women there was an increase from 59 to 63.5. Among Asian women, the 
number dropped from 81.6 in 1982 to 78.8 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
California's fertility rate for all racial and ethnic groups was 76.6 live 
births per 1,000 women in 1987, the highest it has been since 1970 and well 
above the U.S. average of 66.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keeps Going Up' 
</P>
<P>
"California just keeps going up," said Gwendolyn Doebbert, chief of the 
demographic section in the state Department of Health Services, which compiled 
these figures. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers translate into serious overcrowding for many of the state's 
school districts, which already are running well behind the demand for new 
classrooms, laboratories, cafeterias and other needed facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Murdoch, Sacramento lobbyist for an organization called Coalition for 
Adequate School Housing, said the state office of local assistance, which 
allocates money to local school districts, has a $4.3-billion backlog of 
applications for new and updated school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Another $700 million to $750 million in applications are pending in the office 
of the state architect, Murdoch said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to Deukmejian and to majority and minority leaders of the 
Assembly and Senate, schools' chief Honig called this a "crisis facing our 
overcrowded schools." 
</P>
<P>
State voters approved an $800-million school bond measure in June of last year 
and another $800 million last November, but Honig said all these funds have now 
been committed to new construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98, approved by voters last year, assures public schools and 
community colleges of at least 40% of state general revenues, but it applies 
only to operating budgets, not construction. 
</P>
<P>
Pending in the Legislature are two more $1-billion school bond issues -- one 
for the June, 1990, ballot, the second for November, 1990. However, these 
measures must compete with bond issue requests by other state agencies, and the 
governor has been reluctant to place too many bond issues before the voters in 
a single election.

U.S. OFFICIALS WORRIED AS TAIWAN SEEKS REAGAN VISIT

<P>
Taiwan has been seeking to persuade its old friend and longtime supporter, 
former President Ronald Reagan, to visit the island, and some U.S. officials 
are afraid that such a trip could unsettle the Bush Administration's policy 
toward China. 
</P>
<P>
A Reagan spokesman declined to rule out the possibility of a visit to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Taiwanese official called on Reagan in California last spring to 
extend an open-ended invitation to the former President. Reagan is planning to 
visit Japan in October, and some Bush Administration officials believe he might 
stop in Taiwan during that trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think he would consult with President Bush and get advice from the 
National Security Council and State Department" before visiting Taiwan, one 
U.S. official said Friday. "The symbolism of it at this time would be a matter 
of concern . . . . We don't want to do things to drive (Chinese leaders) in 
Beijing to be more paranoid than they already are." 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. source said that "our policy (toward China) is very fragile" at 
the moment. In the aftermath of the Chinese army's June 3-4 assault on 
protesters in Beijing, he explained, the United States does not want to drive 
China toward a new foreign policy of isolation or toward a closer alignment 
with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Weinberg, spokesman for Reagan's office in Los Angeles, told The Times 
that Reagan "does not have plans" to visit Taiwan during his Japan trip. 
</P>
<P>
But when asked whether it is certain Reagan will not visit Taiwan in October, 
Weinberg replied: "His itinerary is to travel from Los Angeles to Tokyo to 
Osaka to Los Angeles." As for a later trip, the Reagan spokesman replied: 
"There are no plans at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen S. F. Chen, deputy representative of the Coordination Council for North 
American Affairs, which represents Taiwan's interests in the United States, 
confirmed that Taiwan has invited Reagan to visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just an invitation we extend to many, many statesmen," he said. Asked 
whether the former president has replied yet, Chen said: "I'm not aware of any 
response." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, Ding Mou-shih, Taiwan's top representative in the 
United States and the Taipei government's former foreign minister, went to see 
Reagan several months ago to discuss the possibility of a visit. Taiwan 
officials would neither confirm nor deny that Ding had seen Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Chen Defu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, hinted Friday 
that China might protest if Reagan visited Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to official or semiofficial exchanges with Taiwan by any 
country having diplomatic relations with China," he said. Chen would not answer 
whether a visit by Reagan would amount to a "semiofficial exchange." 
</P>
<P>
No American President, vice president, secretary of state or former President 
has visited Taiwan since the United States restored diplomatic relations with 
China in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Staunch Taiwan Defender 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming President, Reagan was a staunch defender of Taiwan's 
Nationalist regime and a leading critic of the way in which the Jimmy Carter 
Administration granted diplomatic recognition to the Communist government in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
He visited Taiwan twice. In 1971, shortly after the announcement of Henry A. 
Kissinger's secret trip to Beijing for the Richard Nixon Administration, Reagan 
was dispatched to Taiwan and several other Asian countries as a special 
presidential representative. He traveled to Taiwan again in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan suggested some upgrading of the 
unofficial ties between the United States and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's election resulted in a two-year chill in U.S.-China relations. 
Eventually, his Administration reached an accommodation with the People's 
Republic, and Reagan's 1984 visit to Beijing was regarded as a milestone that 
effectively ended lingering conservative opposition in the United States to the 
policy of recognizing Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Taiwanese officials remember Reagan fondly. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold Mr. Reagan highly," said Daniel Huang, a spokesman for Taiwan's 
Washington office. "He has visited Taiwan twice before. We certainly will be 
very pleased and honored if he can make a trip to Taiwan to see the progress 
achieved during his absence. . . . Whether he travels there from Tokyo or from 
the United States does not matter."

FDA TO SEEK MORE POWER TO PUNISH DRUG COMPANIES FOR BRIBERY, FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration, grappling to contain a burgeoning scandal 
within its generic drugs division, announced Friday that it will ask Congress 
for increased authority to punish drug manufacturers that commit bribery, 
falsify data or engage in other improper activities to gain speedy drug 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said also that it planned to intensify its surveillance of generic 
drug manufacturers and broaden its current investigation of generic companies 
to include inspecting laboratories that perform pre-market testing under 
contract to the generic companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I emphasize that we have no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of 
generic drugs has been compromised," Health and Human Services Secretary Louis 
W. Sullivan said in a written statement. "Nevertheless, the Food and Drug 
Administration has launched extensive reviews of generic drug firms and 
products, and will continue until we can fully confirm the overall quality and 
safety of generic drugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Priced Copies 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken amid a widening federal investigation of the generic drug 
industry, which produces almost one-third of the prescription drugs made in the 
United States. Generic drugs are low-priced copies of brand-name prescription 
drugs whose patents have expired. The industry was reported to have sales 
totaling $3.4 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
The probe has yielded disclosures that several companies have bribed FDA 
officials to obtain faster approval for their products and that others have 
fraudulently submitted drug samples to the government for examination. 
</P>
<P>
The department did not specify the procedures it would seek from lawmakers. But 
HHS and congressional sources said that among the proposals under consideration 
was the power to deny companies all future federal approval of their drugs if 
their employees are found to have offered bribes or commited other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The same sources said the FDA was also considering requesting authority to 
impose substantial civil monetary penalties on companies that submit 
applications found to be fraudulent. Further, these sources said, the agency 
would seek to suspend or withdraw an already approved drug from the market if a 
company was found to have been "tainted by improper activities" in getting that 
drug approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Power Cited 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials have said that they have no power now to stop the marketing of 
drugs in such instances. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said the agency would create a new office of generic drugs, with 
new management and additional resources, and would establish an independent 
ombudsman directly under the FDA commissioner who would mediate grievances from 
the generic companies. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the FDA announced that it would seize samples of the 30 
top-selling generic drugs and examine them to be sure their formulations 
matched those that received federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
"If unsafe or ineffective drugs are discovered, FDA will move rapidly to have 
them removed from commercial distribution," Sullivan said. "If a company is 
found to have submitted false data, FDA will seek to remove all drug products 
that have been implicated. 
</P>
<P>
"And, if evidence points to widespread manufacturing deficiencies, FDA will 
move to block the marketing of all drugs produced in the manufacturing facility 
until the deficiencies have been fully corrected." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Investigations 
</P>
<P>
The generics industry has been under investigation by the U.S. attorney in 
Baltimore and the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Three FDA chemists in the agency's generics division pleaded guilty to 
accepting illegal gifts from firms producing generics, and they have since left 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 350 companies nationwide that produce generics, but the vast 
majority of generic drugs are produced by several dozen of those firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in FDA, including myself, is deeply dismayed and outraged, as I am 
sure consumers are, by the highly unethical conduct displayed by a small number 
of generic drug companies, and by three agency employees who have now 
resigned," FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in a written statement. "Their 
corrupt behavior has jeopardized the public trust and called into question the 
integrity of the system." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiatives Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee and chairman of its oversight subcommittee, welcomed the FDA's latest 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"When the promised legislative proposals are developed," Dingell said, "they 
will receive appropriate consideration. But, before we can be confident of any 
comprehensive solution, we will need to have a fuller understanding of the 
dimensions of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, he said, the subcommittee will continue to pursue its 
investigation.

SHIP FLEES CHRISTIAN LEBANESE PORT UNDER SYRIAN FIRE; 7 INJURED

Syrian gunners fired more than 100 rockets Friday at the only passenger vessel 
that serves the Christian enclave north of Beirut, wounding seven people on the 
pier and forcing the ship to turn back for Cyprus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship left behind nearly 300 people trying to escape the artillery war that 
has killed more than 750 people and wounded more than 2,100, by police count, 
in five months. 
</P>
<P>
The sea route to Cyprus is the only link to the outside world for the 1 million 
Christians of the 310-square-mile enclave, which is blocked on the three other 
sides by Syrian soldiers, guns and tanks. Syria is backing Muslim militias in 
their war with Lebanon's Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Syrians opened up with truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers 
soon after midnight as the hydrofoil Santa Maria docked at Juniyah, a Christian 
port 12 miles north of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The 120 arriving passengers had just disembarked when the rocketing started, 
according to a port spokesman. One rocket hit the pier close to the passengers, 
wounding seven. The Santa Maria then sped away, leaving all but eight of the 
300 departing passengers on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
At the northern end of the Christian enclave Friday, Syrian and Christian 
soldiers fought a four-hour battle across the Madfoun River bridge that police 
described as the most serious since the U.N. Security Council passed a 
cease-fire resolution Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Syrians fired at merchant ships sailing into the Christian port 
of Amsheet, just south of the river, and that Christian gunners fired on Syrian 
positions, touching off the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Christian radio stations said nine Syrian soldiers were killed and 12 were 
wounded in the clash 28 miles north of Beirut. Christian casualties were listed 
as four wounded. Police said they could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian gunners regularly bombard the Christian-held coast north of Beirut to 
disrupt the flow of arms and other goods to the Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Police said three people were killed and 26 wounded in sporadic artillery 
exchanges elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, French envoy Alain Decaux held separate talks with the Maronite 
Catholic patriarch, Nasrallah Sfeir, and with Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, Christian 
commander of the Lebanese army, but he would not speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived Thursday and met in West Beirut with acting Prime Minister Salim 
Hoss, a Sunni Muslim, and Hussein Husseini, the Shiite Muslim Speaker of 
Parliament. Hoss heads a Muslim Cabinet competing for power with the Christian 
government led by Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Hoss said Decaux will "submit a report of his observations to his 
superiors, who would work on a plan to stabilize the situation in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, King Hussein of Jordan and Yasser 
Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, met Friday and agreed to 
ask the Arab League for an emergency summit on the Lebanese crisis. Iraq, an 
enemy of Syria, is the Christians' main arms supplier. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: "We feel there 
is no justification for continued military action in the face of urgent appeals 
and we urge all sides to . . . observe a cease-fire on all fronts." 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting in Beirut began March 8 between the 20,000 
soldiers of Aoun's army and an alliance of 40,000 Syrian soldiers and Muslim 
militias.

An appeals court on Friday agreed to a new trial for Christer Pettersson, who 
was convicted in the slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme, the national TT news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson, a 42, was sentenced to life in prison last month after his 
conviction. He denied shooting Palme and appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also appealed because it wanted to convict Pettersson of 
attempted murder in the wounding of Palme's widow, Lisbeth.

S. AFRICA ARRESTS ACTIVIST, BANS RALLY IN MOVE TO QUELL CAMPAIGN

The South African authorities, moving to crack down on a two-week-old civil 
disobedience campaign as it gathers steam nationwide, arrested a key 
anti-apartheid leader Friday and banned a rally that had been called for Sunday 
to draw attention to unjust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Valli Moosa, a chief organizer of the Mass Democratic Movement and its 
"defiance campaign," was questioned for an hour and then taken into custody by 
plainclothes officers at his office near downtown Johannesburg. Police said he 
is being held under emergency regulations, which allow the government to 
indefinitely detain, without charge, any activist it considers a threat to 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Valli Moosa, 35, and the banning of the rally in Cape Town 
followed days of threats from the government, which has accused Valli Moosa and 
others of trying to violently disrupt the Sept. 6 general elections, which 
exclude the country's black majority. 
</P>
<P>
Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk vowed this week to deal swiftly with 
those who threaten public safety, adding that he hoped it would not be 
necessary to place "great numbers of people into custody." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's actions marked the first major efforts by the government to stop the 
defiance campaign, which began with several hundred blacks seeking medical care 
at whites-only hospitals Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, some of the hundreds of activists living under "restriction 
orders," which prevent them from participating in politics and often amount to 
house arrest, have defied those orders. At least four activists were charged 
this week with violating their restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was to address the Sunday rally, said 
the police decision to ban it was "inflammatory and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Valli Moosa is acting secretary general of the giant United Democratic Front 
(UDF) anti-apartheid coalition, which is among two dozen political 
organizations that have been heavily restricted since last year. He escaped 
after more than a year in detention and was one of three activists who found 
refuge last year in the American Consulate in Johannesburg, leaving after six 
weeks when Pretoria agreed not to detain or restrict them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police fired shotguns and used plastic whips Friday to break up a 
crowd of several hundred black workers protesting a lockout at a pie-making 
plant in Johannesburg, and the company said 17 were injured. The lockout was 
imposed after a wage dispute. 
</P>
<P>
And a judge sentenced Trevor Tutu, son of Archbishop Tutu, to 18 months in 
prison for making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's international airport. 
Tutu, who said he would appeal, has said he was courting arrest as part of a 
publicity stunt for his advertising agency.

EAST-WEST GERMAN MEETING FAILS TO RESOLVE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
NO BREAK IN DEADLOCK OVER REFUGEES IN BONN MISSIONS

<P>
East Germany and West Germany failed to reach agreement Friday on solving the 
crisis over the crush of East Germans seeking to settle in the West, a senior 
Bonn official reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it has to be said that East Germany is not prepared to go 
beyond its original promise," Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff to Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, told reporters after he met for two hours in East Berlin with East 
Germany's deputy foreign minister, Herbert Krolikowski. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany has pledged not to prosecute East Germans who have taken refuge in 
Bonn's mission in East Berlin and its embassies in Hungary, Poland and 
Czechoslovakia. But it has refused demands for a guarantee that it would allow 
refugees who voluntarily returned to East Germany to go to the West at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kohl Willing to Meet Honecker 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Kohl said he was willing to meet East German Communist 
leader Erich Honecker in an attempt to resolve the refugee crisis that has 
soured relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was urgently necessary to make personal contact, I would do so 
immediately, if it appeared useful," Kohl said in a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl added that he has no present plans to visit East Berlin, where more than 
100 East Germans are sheltered in the West German mission. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans entered the West German mission, seeking passports or other 
documents that would allow them to travel to the West. But because such 
documents are not enough to gain the would-be travelers passage through East 
German border controls, the West German mission is not issuing them. 
</P>
<P>
The East German petitioners have remained in the mission building, which has 
been closed to the public, and West German officials are under orders not to 
expel them. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.5 million East Germans would seek to emigrate if the Communist 
regime would let them leave, officials here say. But only about 90,000 East 
Germans will be allowed to emigrate officially this year. 
</P>
<P>
West German authorities are trying to negotiate exit visas for those in the 
mission, without success so far. The East German government has said that it 
will not prosecute the refugees but that it would not guarantee them permission 
to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Budapest, where about 180 East Germans wishing to travel to the 
West have taken refuge in the West German Embassy, charity workers set up 12 
tents to accommodate about 250 additional visa seekers who were waiting outside 
the building. A field kitchen and mobile sanitary facilities were also put into 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacationers Seek Visas 
</P>
<P>
Many East Germans on vacation in Hungary have sought visas at the West German 
Embassy or have tried to cross the border illegally into Austria. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,000 East Germans have evaded Hungarian border controls in the 
past two weeks and made their way to West Germany through Austria. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the government announced that because of the heavy influx of East 
Germans, the main camp for refugees at Geissen is overflowing and an unused 
army camp near Muenster will be prepared to handle newcomers, who automatically 
receive West German passports and welfare benefits.

An Air Force Delta 2 rocket, chalking up its third straight success, hurled a 
$65-million military satellite into orbit Friday in a pre-dawn flight visible 
for miles along the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force reported 30 minutes after liftoff that the 128-foot-tall rocket 
had performed flawlessly and had propelled the satellite into an initial 
elliptical orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Delta 2 has put its payload into a successful orbit," said Lt. Col. Ron 
Rand, the launching control center commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Ground controllers will command an on-board motor to fire Sunday to shift the 
satellite into a circular orbit 11,000 miles above the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The $30-million Delta rocket carries a Navstar Global Positioning System 
Satellite, the third in a new series of spacecraft that enable military units 
such as aircraft, ships, submarines, tanks and field troops to determine their 
location within 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The satellites, effective in any kind of weather, also keep track of military 
units' speed within a fraction of a mile per hour.

REWARD OFFER FAILS TO SPARK GOLD RUSH OF ENGINE-PART SEARCHERS ON IOWA FARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Despite rewards totaling $279,000, farmers in northwestern Iowa are not rushing 
to look for missing bits and pieces of the DC-10 jet engine that blew apart on 
United's Flight 232 last month. 
</P>
<P>
The parts, considered critical to an investigation of the incident, are 
believed scattered over a 16-square-mile area dense with ripening corn and 
soybeans north of this little agricultural community. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the engine 
failure that led to the plane's July 19 crash in Sioux City, about 60 miles 
west of here, said that without the parts "it will be difficult" to determine 
why the engine came apart. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, maker of the engine, last week offered farmers living in the 
search area up to $50,000 for turning in one missing part and lesser amounts 
for other parts, hoping to speed their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is going on now, and we'd like to have the parts as soon as 
possible," said Dave Lane, a spokesman for General Electric Aircraft Engines in 
Evandale, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Every Possible Piece' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get every possible piece of that plane that we can," NTSB spokesman 
Alan Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
"Search?" Buena Vista County Sheriff Chuck Eddy asked. "There isn't much of a 
search." Eddy, who is collecting parts as they are recovered, said that, in the 
first 10 days since the rewards were offered, he had received only "a couple of 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been searching here and there," said Steve Lullman, a worker at the 
Mellow Dent Seed farm in the search area. "But we don't do it on company time. 
I think it's a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
"They're looking in an area that's bigger than downtown Los Angeles, and its 
covered with corn and beans," said Mitch Quirin, research director for Mellow 
Dent. "That's one heck of an area to be looking for nuts and bolts and pieces 
of metal the size of your forearm." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and trappers familiar with the terrain believe recovery of parts is 
unlikely before the September harvest. Chances will also improve when hunting 
begins in the autumn and when trappers begin moving through groves, along 
creeks and in areas not under cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (that) when they start taking the crops out, calls will be a little 
more frequent," Eddy said. "There are creeks and ponds and timber and abandoned 
farm places. They could have fallen in somebody's grove with all their old 
machinery around." 
</P>
<P>
"How you gonna find anything in here?" asked Clarence Peterson, 84, leading a 
visitor into a field of corn. 
</P>
<P>
The plants are up to 10 feet tall, and the foliage, dusty and abrasive, is so 
thick that little light filters into the narrow rows between plants. 
</P>
<P>
"You could be walking down one row and there could be something in the next row 
and you wouldn't see it," said Peterson, whose family operates several farms in 
the search area. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans are also particularly dense in these final weeks of the growing 
season. They grow much lower to the ground than corn, and it is impossible to 
see the earth through the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric offered rewards only to farmers on whose land the parts are 
found to prevent trespassing and to keep the area from being inundated by 
treasure hunters in search of a bounty. 
</P>
<P>
Rewards range from $50,000 for a 300-pound, truck-tire-size titanium disc to 
$1,000 each for 20 nuts and 20 bolts to $500 for each of 57 missing fan blades. 
</P>
<P>
Currently the rewards are available only to Aug. 31, but sources close to the 
investigation said they could be extended. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if General Electric was disappointed by the relatively low level of 
response to the reward offer, company spokesman Lane said: "We understand many 
of those people are professional farmers and they have a lot of things on their 
minds this time of year. We certainly (would have) liked to have seen some 
results. That's why we offered the reward."

The fear of catching Lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to use 
insect repellents in potentially harmful ways, the Environmental Protection 
Agency reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, which regulates the pesticides used in insect repellents, said misuse 
of repellents could result in adverse skin reactions, headaches, mood changes 
and possibly even convulsions or unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Only a "small number" of reports of ill effects have been received, but they 
have prompted "concern that fear of Lyme disease or the use of repellents for 
other biting pests may result in misuse or overuse of these products," the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Georgeson, a spokeswoman for S. C. Johnson Wax, manufacturer of the 
insect repellent Off, said the company endorsed the EPA advisory because "it's 
very important to have people continue to use these products properly." 
</P>
<P>
The widely used insect repellent accounts for about 70% of the repellent 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson said that, because of the widespread publicity surrounding Lyme 
disease, which is transmitted by deer ticks, sales of repellents are expected 
to be about 10% higher this year.

The explosion occurred about 4:40 p.m. when the employees were pouring molten 
primer into a mold. The solidified primer is used to ignite blasting agents, 
said Peter Astrauskas, technical director of the Atlas Powder Co. The plant is

COURT LETS AMISH REJECT BUGGY EMBLEMS

<P>
The Minnesota Supreme Court on Friday dismissed traffic citations against 14 
Amish who had refused to display safety emblems on their horse-drawn buggies as 
required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Minnesota's Amish community have a constitutional right to refuse to 
affix the orange-red slow-moving-vehicle emblems to their buggies, the court 
ruled unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
"These appellants . . . are unwilling to compromise their belief that the 
'loud' colors required and the 'worldly symbols' the triangular shape 
represents to them conflict with the admonitions found in Apostle Paul's 
epistles," Associate Justice Glenn Kelley wrote. "To them, to do so would be 
putting their faith in 'worldly symbols' rather than in God." 
</P>
<P>
Between February and September of last year each of the defendants received a 
traffic citation for operating a horse-drawn buggy on a public highway without 
displaying the emblem or an alternative black triangular emblem that the law 
permits in cases such as theirs. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Fillmore County District Judge Clement H. Snyder rejected the 
Amish contention that the requirement violated their constitutional right to 
freely exercise their religious beliefs, but he asked that a higher state court 
review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Because some members of the Amish community do not object to complying with the 
law, Snyder held that the Amish did not have a collective, genuine, sincere 
religious belief on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
He ruled also that, although application of the statute did infringe on the 
exercise of the religious belief of some of the Amish, the infringement was 
warranted by a compelling state interest -- protecting the health, safety and 
welfare of all travelers on public highways. 
</P>
<P>
In the decision released Friday, the Supreme Court agreed with the Amish 
defendants that the trial court had improperly determined that, to be sincere, 
a belief must be shared by a religious community as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court held also that the state has a legitimate interest in 
protecting the public, including the Amish, on its highways. But it ruled that 
even the option under the law for use of a black triangular sign was burdensome 
to the Amish religious beliefs.

A truck carrying 40,000 rounds of ammunition for warplanes went up in flames 
and explosions early Friday, killing the driver, injuring her husband and 
closing an interstate for hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The tractor-trailer rig, loaded with 20-millimeter shells for aircraft cannon, 
veered off Interstate 17, went into a ditch and caught fire in a remote area 
about 30 miles north of Phoenix around 1 a.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The shells kept exploding; it was like fireworks," said Rock Springs Fire 
Chief Pete Davis. "There were shells for about 100 yards on either side. You 
couldn't walk without stepping on one." 
</P>
<P>
Although no evacuations were necessary, the sporadic explosions kept 
authorities at bay until about 5:30 a.m., Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the driver, Lois Bailey, 38, of Coleman, Ala., wasn't found for 
hours because of the danger, State Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
Her 33-year-old husband, Rick, was in serious condition at a hospital in 
Phoenix, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The backup on I-17, the major link between Phoenix and Flagstaff, stretched 10 
miles and traffic was delayed for hours, Schmidt said.

TANTALIZING TASTE OF THINGS TO COME;

<P>
VOYAGER DISCOVERS MAGNETIC FIELD ON NEPTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, the spacecraft Voyager has detected intense radio signals 
coming from Neptune, revealing that the planet has a magnetic field and 
indicating that next week's close encounter will be as intriguing as scientists 
had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery suggests that the spacecraft will find a wide range of 
interesting phenomena as it passes close to the distant planet Thursday night, 
including the kind of auroral activity that produces the northern and southern 
lights on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The signals were first detected last Monday, but scientists at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory were not sure they were coming from Neptune, according to 
James Warwick, principal investigator on the planetary radio astronomy 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not What Was Expected 
</P>
<P>
"Their character was different than what we were expecting," Warwick said. 
</P>
<P>
"The radio emissions are very intense," Warwick said, adding that they came in 
short, powerful bursts over a limited frequency range. Scientists had expected 
radio signals from Neptune, but they were looking for something less intense 
and less limited in frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
Warwick and fellow scientists working on the project decided to announce the 
discovery Friday after they grew more confident of what they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery means Neptune has a strong magnetic field because radio waves are 
generated by charged particles that become trapped in the magnetic field and 
spiral into the planet's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same process that produces the northern lights on Earth. Charged 
particles from space flow along the Earth's magnetic field lines and into the 
atmosphere at either the North or South Pole, producing the celestial fireworks 
over the higher latitudes. Now, Voyager is expected to see the same thing at 
Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Within 3,000 Miles 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager spacecraft, which will make its fourth and final planetary flyby 
next week when it passes within about 3,000 miles of Neptune's cloud tops, used 
a radio receiver and a giant pair of "rabbit ears" to detect the radio 
emissions -- just as it did at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Each 33-foot-long 
ear scans a series of frequencies and, since they work separately, the 
"polarization," or vibration, of the signals can be determined, thus 
distinguishing between radio signals generated by lightning and those created 
by a magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are dealing with a magnetic field," Warwick said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a magnetic field also tells scientists something about the 
interior of Neptune. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of 
its molten iron core, and Neptune's strong magnetic field suggests that Neptune 
also has a region of fluid in its interior. 
</P>
<P>
Venus, Mars and probably Pluto do not have magnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
Early analysis of the data from Voyager indicates that Neptune's magnetic field 
is similar in intensity to Earth's. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more data is collected on the magnetic field, scientists will be 
able to determine more precisely the length of a Neptunian day -- the time it 
takes for one rotation. That is believed to be about 18 hours, but by the time 
Voyager is through that figure should be known exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists have known little about Neptune other than such things as 
its atmospheric composition, which includes the methane that makes it appear 
blue. But Voyager will pass right over the planet's north pole, and that is 
fortuitous for scientists who are interested in its magnetic field. That 
trajectory will carry it through the intense field where charged particles are 
being funneled into the polar atmosphere, and that should reveal much about the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, by the time Voyager zips past Neptune it will have collected enough 
data for scientists to learn more about its magnetic field than any other 
planet except Earth.

CHANGES PLANNED TO BOOST SIZE OF LOTTO JACKPOTS, KEEP THE DOLLARS FLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In an effort to attract more gamblers, the state Lottery Commission has 
approved changes in the Lotto game designed to generate significantly larger 
jackpots, while lessening the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also approved the introduction of two more lottery games to be 
called Topper and Decco, which are expected to appeal to players who prefer 
something that will give them a better chance of winning, even if the prizes 
are minuscule by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to provide our players with lots of choices, lots of options in 
picking a game that has the odds they want. We want to be able to provide a 
broad range of games that appeal to all our players," said Carolyn Walker, 
publicity manager for the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
It is all part of a long-term strategy to get more people to play the lottery 
and keep a steady stream of dollars flowing to the state's education system, 
Walker said. In the 1988-89 state fiscal year, the lottery contributed $1.05 
billion to schools on sales of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Interest 
</P>
<P>
Walker said officials found the greatest interest in the lottery was generated 
by the big jackpots of $20 million to $30 million, while sales seemed to slump 
when the pot dwindled to $5 million or $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
To create bigger jackpots and cash in on the heightened interest they bring to 
the lottery, the commission has voted to add four more numbers to the field 
that players select from when they buy a Lotto ticket. Beginning in April, for 
each $1 ticket, Lotto players will pick six numbers from a field of 53 instead 
of 49. 
</P>
<P>
With the extra numbers, the odds of winning will change from one in 14 million 
to one in 22 million. The odds of winning any cash prize in the Lotto game will 
go from one in 54 to one in 67. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said officials expect the change in the game to produce more roll-over 
jackpots, or instances when there are no big winners, so that whatever is in 
that day's pot is added to the jackpot for the next drawing. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to maintain the excitement of the Lotto game, we needed to increase 
the field size so we would have more roll-overs," Walker said. "Our sales 
increase very dramatically when we have a very large jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
California has not had a huge jackpot since March when eight winners divided a 
$44.8-million prize. The lottery accumulated its biggest pot in October, 1988, 
when it grew to $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lotto game is so popular that well over 50% of the adults in California 
play Lotto on a fairly regular basis," Walker said. "Because of the number of 
players, there were lots of people picking number combinations, so the jackpot 
was being hit frequently, keeping it low. It made our sales a little soft or 
unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Game 
</P>
<P>
But for those who like a better chance of taking home some cash, the commission 
has created Decco, a new game that will debut in January or February. Players 
will pick a card from each of the four suits in a deck. The lottery computer 
will then also pick a card from each of the suits. 
</P>
<P>
If the player holds the same four picks, he wins $5,000. If he can match three 
of the four, he collects $50. If he matches two of the four, he wins $5. For 
holding one of the four, he gets a free game. His odds of winning top prize in 
the game are one in 28,561. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly different odds will be offered in another new game to be introduced in 
April. Called Topper, the game will piggyback on the Lotto game. After 
purchasing a $1 Lotto ticket, the player will be able to activate Topper for 
another $1. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the game, for each play the computer will automatically pick 
three California cities from a field of 100. At the twice weekly drawings for 
Lotto, there will also be a Topper drawing. Players holding a ticket with all 
three cities picked in the drawing will win $25,000. Those holding two of three 
cities will get $95 and those holding one will collect $2. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of winning $25,000 will be one in 161,700.

ETHICS PLAN PRAISED AS 'EXTRAORDINARY'; 
</P>
<P>
BUT WATCHDOG GROUP URGES BIG CHANGES TO MAKE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS WORK 
</P>

<P>
California Common Cause on Friday praised as an "extraordinary effort" the 
Assembly's newly proposed ethics reform for legislators but warned that major 
changes are necessary to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that they have come up short, but that should not detract . . . from 
the massive, complete and deliberate effort to study the problem and forge a 
solution," said Walter Zelman, executive director of the citizens lobbying 
organization. "These are major steps toward a solution, but major steps are 
needed still." 
</P>
<P>
In an analysis of the reform package, Common Cause said it was pleased that the 
Assembly proposal covers virtually all areas of ethical concern, with the 
exception of campaign financing. However, it cited loopholes that the 
organization said could potentially lead to lax enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"Its greatest weakness seems to be that it is too willing to rely on internal 
enforcement. Self-enforcement means weak enforcement," Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was fashioned by a special Assembly committee in the wake of years 
of criticism of ethics of legislators. The issue came to a head one year ago 
when the FBI raided Capitol offices of legislators during an investigation of 
suspected corruption. 
</P>
<P>
As Common Cause, a good-government lobby, issued its analysis of the Assembly 
plan, Senate Democratic and Republican leaders were busy pitching their own 
draft proposal on ethics reform to California newspaper editors. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate draft contains many of the same provisions as the Assembly proposal 
and the two probably will be melded into a compromise as the Legislature heads 
toward adjournment Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiatives in the Works 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, several proposed ethics reform initiatives for next year's ballot are 
in the works. Presumably, they would deal more severely with state 
officeholders than reforms enacted by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said although there is no 
agreement between the two houses yet, leaders of both have set ethics reform at 
the "top of our agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said in order to get citizens to "concentrate" on the Legislature's 
handling of important issues, "we have to remove this obstacle -- the obstacle 
of the negative perception that the public has of the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Zelman observed that "legislators are very concerned that the public is losing 
confidence in the Legislature and government in general. They may see it as a 
matter of perception, but we see it as a matter of reality." 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly Ethics Committee plan, released earlier this month, takes a broad 
swipe at reforming ethical standards for elected officials and their staffs. 
Among its provisions, the committee's proposal would: 
</P>
<P>
* Establish an independent, nine-member citizens salary commission to set 
legislative pay, benefits and tax-free expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
* Place a $1,000 limit on the amount legislators can receive for speeches or 
appearances from a single source until establishment of the salary commission, 
when such payments would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
* Ban the acceptance by legislators of most gifts, with some exceptions, and 
mandate disclosure of all gifts, including gifts of travel, worth more than 
$50. 
</P>
<P>
* Prevent former legislators and their staffs from working as lobbyists for one 
year after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said the major concern with the Assembly package was the committee's 
recommendation that the reforms first be enacted as rules and enforced by the 
Legislature itself before they are actually set into law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Excuse to Object' 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that they would then use the adoption of rules as an excuse 
to object to putting those items down as law," Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause also took issue with the Assembly plan to make the ban on 
honorariums contingent upon voter approval of the establishment of the citizens 
salary commission, Zelman said. The Assembly plan also does not go far enough 
in subjecting legislators and elected state officials to conflict-of-interest 
laws that apply to locally elected officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders are seeking support for their own plan, which deals with most of 
the same issues as the Assembly proposal. But among the differences, the Senate 
plan would: 
</P>
<P>
* Ban all honorariums, but only if voters approve creation of a citizens salary 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit gifts to elected officials worth more than $250 from any person, 
corporation, union or lobbyist employer. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the amount of outside income earned by legislators to 30% of annual 
salary. Legislative salaries now are $40,816. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said the Senate proposal is "harder to assess because it is not 
elaborate in its detail and there were no public hearings. But it seems to be 
in the same ballpark" as the Assembly ethics package. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman criticized the Senate draft as too lenient on its limitation of gifts. 
He said the study's criticism of the Assembly plan concerning conflict of 
interest and linking the honorariums ban to the creation of a salary commission 
also applied to the Senate plan.

BARDO ILLEGALLY EXTRADITED, HIS LAWYER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A defense attorney for the man accused of murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer 
asked Friday that the case against his client be dropped, charging that Robert 
John Bardo was illegally extradited from Arizona to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Stephen E. Galindo argued that the case be dismissed in 
Los Angeles and that Bardo be returned to Arizona for a hearing because Los 
Angeles police officers snatched the suspect without court approval. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts should not sanction or condone unlawful police practices," Galindo 
said in a motion filed before Municipal Judge David M. Horwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have maintained that they broke no laws in extraditing Bardo, 19. 
</P>
<P>
Bearded and with a bandage wrapped around one hand, Bardo listened quietly as 
Horwitz rescheduled his arraignment for Sept. 13 to allow Galindo time to 
collect affidavits to support the defense's contentions. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo said he did not know why his client was wearing the bandage. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo is accused of stalking and fatally shooting Schaeffer, 21, co-star of the 
television series "My Sister Sam," at her Fairfax District apartment house on 
July 18. Bardo was arrested and jailed in Tucson a day after the actress was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigators said Bardo directed them to the .357 magnum 
used to kill Schaeffer, a bloody shirt and copy of "Catcher in the Rye," all 
found near the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, Bardo was spirited out of Tucson to Los Angeles County Jail by Los 
Angeles police officers who arrived late at night. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argued that the extradition was legal because Bardo's attorney in 
Tucson, Pima County Assistant Public Defender Lori Lefferts, unknowingly filed 
a motion against the action at the wrong courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"She filed a motion in Justice Court (in Tucson), which has no jurisdiction," 
said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, who is prosecuting 
Bardo. "She should have walked across the street and filed a writ in Superior 
Court. The Justice Court judge couldn't grant her a stay even if he'd wanted 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said an Aug. 18 deadline was set for the prosecution to present its 
extradition papers. She said the defense lawyers mistakenly assumed that the 
date applied to their motion as well. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lefferts, in an interview Friday, insisted that Aug. 18 was the 
correct deadline and that she did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I filed the writ in the proper court before the Aug. 18 deadline (for the 
writ) expired, but that was done after Bardo was illegally taken," Lefferts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts added that the county attorney in Tucson "apparently didn't understand 
the law" concerning extradition. 
</P>
<P>
"And to cover up," she said, "they have blamed me for making a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
She characterized her office as incensed about the extradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely angry that (the police officers) would sneak over here in the 
middle of the night and do something like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona officials said they do not intend to actively seek Bardo's return but 
will depend on Galindo to prove in Los Angeles Municipal Court that the 
extradition of Bardo violated his constitutional right of due process. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo said he is seeking a hearing on the matter to clear up "speculation" 
about the extradition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several people who are pertinent witnesses to the issues I have 
brought up," he said. "However, it doesn't seem that the court is willing to 
accept my proposal for a hearing."

TUTTLE PUTS BRADLEY BACK IN WITNESS CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after he was questioned by the city attorney and his investigative 
team, Mayor Tom Bradley again found himself in the witness chair Friday when he 
was interviewed for several hours by City Controller Rick Tuttle and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle's session with the mayor was a clear signal that the controller's 
special audits of questionable financial transactions were back on track. They 
had been derailed several weeks ago when police investigators working with City 
Atty. James K. Hahn requested that the controller hold off on interviewing 
certain people until the city attorney's investigators were finished with them. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's office is leading a wide-ranging investigation of the mayor's financial 
ties with people and institutions that do business with the city. Once Hahn 
wrapped up his two days of questioning Bradley on Thursday, Tuttle lost no time 
in resuming his own inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle has said his office is conducting a regular annual audit of the 
treasurer's office as well as three special audits. They include the city's 
transactions with Far East National Bank, which employed Bradley as an 
$18,000-a-year adviser and which received city deposits during that time; the 
city's funding of the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, which is 
headed by Bradley business associate Juanita St. John, and procedures in the 
city clerk's office, which has responsibility for authorizing payments to such 
groups as the Africa task force. 
</P>
<P>
The controller was joined by investigators from the city attorney's office 
Friday, but they were there only to "assist" the controller and did not ask any 
questions, a spokeswoman for Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Tuttle nor Bradley would comment on Friday's session, but aides to both 
officials confirmed that the meeting took place in the mayor's City Hall office 
and lasted for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks Tuttle has interviewed under oath key aides to Bradley, 
including Deputy Mayor Mike Gage. A source in the mayor's office said it was 
"presumed" that Tuttle put Bradley under oath, although the city attorney did 
not.

Tuttle's staff is also wrapping up its regular annual audit of the city 
treasurer's office. Revelations about practices in that office rocked City Hall 
last month when a council hearing into the treasurer's dealings with Far East 
revealed that officials had placed $2 million in deposits there after an 
inquiry from Bradley, had attempted to hide a reference to the mayor and then 
had tried to hide the lack of competitive bids.

STATE WASTE BOARD AFFIRMS CURBS ON DUMPING AT LOPEZ CANYON

Despite Los Angeles city officials' claims that the action could shut down 
their only city-owned trash dump, the California Waste Management Board voted 
Friday to affirm a staff order calling for stricter limits on dumping at the 
Lopez Canyon landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the state board, Los Angeles officials reiterated their 
warnings that they will be forced to close Lopez Canyon landfill within days if 
the state restrictions are enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is faced with a real crisis if it is forced to comply with this 
order," said Assistant City Atty. John Haggerty. "The Bureau of Sanitation has 
indicated they would only have a few more days of operation left." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Chicken Little" 
</P>
<P>
Opponents and neighborhood critics of the dump above Lake View Terrace, 
however, cast doubt on the city's claim, saying it is tantamount to city 
officials playing "Chicken Little" by issuing alarmist proclamations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, outside the boardroom, Haggerty and other officials conceded that the 
closure would last three months at the most -- until the city could prepare 
another area of the city-operated landfill for dumping. After that, the 
landfill would be able to accept trash for another year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hogwash, and it's an irresponsible act on the part of the Bureau of 
Sanitation to try to create panic and mold the public point of view," said Rob 
Zapple, who lives near the northeast San Fernando Valley landfill and is a 
frequent critic of it. "It's just infuriating all of us." 
</P>
<P>
The board's staff on Aug. 2 rejected a more lenient order issued by Los Angeles 
County and directly imposed state restrictions on trash dumping at Lopez 
Canyon. The order called for cutting back the height of its garbage mounds from 
1,760 feet to 1,725 feet and limiting the number of trucks that dump there 
daily from 600 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit Filed 
</P>
<P>
City officials are challenging that order in a lawsuit filed against the state 
in Los Angeles Superior Court. Because the city has won a temporary restraining 
order against the state, there is no chance that Lopez Canyon would be closed 
before the next court hearing, scheduled for Aug. 31, Bureau of Sanitation 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Peck, the California Waste Management Board's spokesman, said Friday that 
state board members have been aware of discrepancies in the city's assessment 
of the impact of the enforcement order. He noted that the city never has 
offered any proof that limiting operations at Lopez Canyon would result in 
forced closure. 
</P>
<P>
City officials defended their statements, saying they have merely tried to 
prepare the public for the worst possible scenario. Plans to move into the new 
area of Lopez Canyon -- a ravine that is currently unused -- still need 
approval from the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Haggerty said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't assume that will happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounting Trash Crisis 
</P>
<P>
The section of the state's order that reduces the height of garbage mounds is 
precisely what would force closure of Lopez Canyon Landfill and exacerbate the 
city's mounting trash crisis, city officials maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Because the trash heaps in Lopez Canyon are already higher than the state 
height limits, the city would have to shut down the landfill to abide by the 
order while they prepare the adjoining area for dumping. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the new dumping area is ready, it too will fill up and result in the 
dump's closure two years earlier than anticipated -- in 1990 instead of 1992, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They have estimated that rerouting the trash to private and public landfills 
after that time would cost at least $26 million a year in disposal fees. Some 
of that cost would have to be passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon accepts two-thirds of the city's residential trash. For years 
neighbors have complained about odors, noise and dust at the site. But the 
state's intense scrutiny of the dump began March 8, when two workers fainted 
after unearthing a pocket of toxic gas produced by decaying trash. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the board threatened after 30 days to strip the county Department 
of Health Services of its responsibility for enforcing health and safety 
regulations at 83 dumps and trash transfer stations, partly because of the 
county's unwillingness to crack down on Lopez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions of why the city is nearing a trash crisis always include mention of 
the City Council's rejection of LANCER -- a waste-to-energy plant -- the slow 
start-up of recycling programs and early closure of the politically unpopular 
Mission Canyon, located in the Santa Monica mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said the waste board's intention is not to shut down Lopez Canyon but 
rather to force the city to prepare for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It really comes down to long-term planning in Los Angeles, and they really 
have not done that successfully," he said.

NEW ROLES PLANNED FOR 2 HOLLYWOOD THEATERS; 
</P>
<P>
. . . AND A DRAMA IS SHAPING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The owner of the Hollywood Wax Museum plans to buy two landmark movie theaters 
on Hollywood Boulevard -- the Hollywood and the Vogue -- and convert them into 
tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Spoony Singh said he hopes to convert the historic Hollywood Theater to a 
Guinness Book of World Records attraction that would be "the largest of its 
kind." "We thought about a Ripley's Believe It Or Not (attraction), but decided 
that Guinness was better," Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood, built in 1913, is the second-oldest movie house still operating 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Mann Theaters, which owns both properties, is said to have 
imposed deed restrictions to prohibit future owners from using either of the 
movie houses as theaters, according to sources familiar with the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Mann officials declined comment. Sources said the company decided to sell the 
huge single-screen theaters in the heart of Hollywood because they were no 
longer profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Some preservationists, upset at the prospect of losing two historic theaters in 
the world's most famous movie district, criticized the company's plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad any time you lose movie houses like these, but when it happens in the 
middle of what's supposed to be the movie capital of the world, it's especially 
tragic," activist Robert Nudelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nudelman heads an advisory panel on Hollywood redevelopment that, although 
officially dissolved by the Los Angeles City Council in May after angering 
Councilman Michael Woo, has continued to meet. Last month the group urged Mann 
not to impose restrictions against using the buildings as theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing for (the company) to say they aren't interested in preserving 
these theaters as part of Hollywood's heritage," Nudelman said, "but for them 
to prevent someone else from coming in and doing it is unforgivable." 
</P>
<P>
Other preservationists said they hope Singh does not plan to dramatically alter 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the architectural and historic integrity of the buildings 
preserved, and would hope that the theaters aren't irreversibly gutted," said 
Hillsman Wright, president of the Los Angeles Historic Theatre Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"If large single-screen theaters aren't viable now, who's to say that they 
might not be in five or 10 years?" Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Singh said he intends to "preserve the integrity" of the buildings. "I have no 
interest in going in there and tearing everything out. I want them to be 
protected better than they have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Singh has yet to decide what to do with the Vogue, designed in 1934 by renowned 
theater architect S. Charles Lee, although he said "the plan may involve 
something on the order of an IMAX-type theater operation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Seek Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Mann Theaters, which operates Mann's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, is 
also said to be seeking a buyer for the Fox, another landmark movie house on 
the boulevard, built in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
Singh, who plans to close escrow on the Hollywood Theater next week, declined 
to say what he agreed to pay for the movie houses. The sale of the Vogue is to 
be made final in several months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Cohen, who heads Mann's real estate division, referred all questions to 
William Hertz, the company's vice president for marketing and public relations. 
Hertz did not return numerous phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Renovation of the theaters must be approved by the city Department of Building 
and Safety as well as the Community Redevelopment Agency, since they are within 
the agency's Hollywood redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
And because each building is on the National Register of Historic Places, the 
agency has the authority to require environmental impact reports and conduct 
hearings on proposed changes to the buildings before they are approved, said 
Robert Tague, the CRA's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to (Mann officials) and expressed our concern with the potential 
loss of the theaters as theaters," Tague said. "However, we were advised that 
there was nothing we could do legally to prevent that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Singh said he envisions a Guinness attraction of about 15,000 square feet that 
will make it slightly larger than the one in London, the Guinness 
organization's principal such attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably going to have the tallest man and the heaviest man and exhibits 
like that, but I want the emphasis to be on the movies, since this is 
Hollywood," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES DROPPED IN ENDANGERMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office in Pomona on Friday dropped felony charges 
against an Albuquerque, N.M., man accused of endangering six boys when he took 
them on a trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
The case was dismissed because the boys' mothers told authorities that the man 
was innocent and refused to testify in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Steven Davis, 37, had been arrested July 27 after one of the boys, Robby 
Criner, 11, was discovered by a sheriff's deputy as the boy was trying to sell 
candy in a Diamond Bar K mart parking lot. After interviewing the six children, 
authorities believed that Davis had forced the boys to sell candy in exchange 
for a trip to Disneyland and that Davis had neglected to feed them and lodged 
them in a Pomona motel frequented by prostitutes, drug dealers and gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
But shortly after Davis was released Aug. 3 on $1,500 bail, the boys recanted 
parts of their stories, contending that Davis followed through on his promise 
to take them to Disneyland and never neglected them, according to Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Michael Yglecias. One of the boys' mothers described Davis as a 
"trustworthy" man who had kept the boys out of trouble, prosecutors said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALE OF BUILDING TO HOMELESS GROUP OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council agreed Friday to sell a city-owned Westside 
apartment building to a nonprofit homeless assistance organization to provide 
permanent housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Council members gave the go-ahead to People Assisting The Homeless to purchase 
the four-unit building at 5105 W. 20th St. for $314,000 with a 3% loan from the 
city's Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA has sold at least two other buildings to homeless groups in the 
downtown area, said Bill Jones, the CRA director of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
PATH helps more than 3,500 people a year through its referral and counseling 
center, 30-bed men's shelter and 21-bed "transitional" shelter where homeless 
singles and families can live rent-free for up to 60 days after finding jobs so 
they can start saving money, Smollar said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI POLICE SEIZE $94-MILLION CACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in Simi Valley announced Friday the largest seizure of cocaine ever by 
law enforcement officers from Ventura County -- 2,068 pounds with an estimated 
street value of $94 million. 
</P>
<P>
The drug seizure and the arrests of five Colombian nationals, however, were all 
made in neighboring Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 p.m Thursday, officers stopped a car under surveillance on the Golden 
State Freeway in Newhall and found 277 pounds of the drug inside, Simi Valley 
Police Chief Paul Miller said. They arrested the driver, Angelo Alviro, 41, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a Chatsworth house, investigators found 1,791 pounds of cocaine in a 
parked van and arrested Roceo Campo, 26, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
At a house in the 25000 block of Wintergreen Court in Newhall, no drugs were 
found but three people were arrested. They were identified as Efraim 
Belalclzar, 38, and Derly De La Cruz, 27, both of Newhall, and Francisco 
Altoreilo, 28, who lives in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
All five were being held on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance.

JURORS CAN'T AGREE ON ABORTION DEATH BLAME; MISTRIAL DECLARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A malpractice suit filed by the family of a woman who died after an abortion at 
Inglewood Women's Hospital in 1987 ended in a mistrial Friday because jurors 
could not agree on whether the hospital or two of its doctors contributed to 
the woman's death. 
</P>
<P>
The jury said the now-closed hospital and Dr. Morton Barke, its chief of staff, 
did show negligence in the handling Belinda Byrd's abortion, but jurors could 
not agree on whether the negligence contributed to Byrd's death. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the third defendant, Dr. Steven Pine, who performed Byrd's 
abortion, the jury could not agree on whether he even showed negligence in his 
handling of the patient. Pine settled out of court for $250,000 earlier in the 
week, but the jury was unaware of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs had to show that the defendants were negligent in their handling 
of Byrd and that their negligence contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
David Berglund, the attorney for Byrd's mother and three children, predicted 
that a settlement with the Barke and the hospital would not be reached and that 
the case would return to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, who was in her 19th week of pregnancy, slipped into a coma several hours 
after her abortion on Jan. 24, 1987. She was then taken to Centinela Medical 
Center where she died three days later. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund argued in court that Pine and the hospital staff did not adequately 
monitor Byrd after the operation. He called the Inglewood hospital "an abortion 
assembly line" in which Byrd's was one of 74 abortions performed by Pine in one 
day. A coroner's report ruled that Byrd died from a perforated uterus suffered 
during the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's death was one factor that led state health officials to launch an 
investigation of the hospital, which resulted in a revocation of its license in 
February, 1988. Family Planning Associates Medical Group, an abortion clinic 
run by Dr. Edward Allred, now operates on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The defense said during the trial that Byrd's condition appeared relatively 
normal to hospital staff until she suddenly suffered a heart attack and lost 
consciousness because of a rare blood clot that formed in her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a message at all, it's that this is a very complicated case, 
clouded by emotions, that is not easily decided," said Robert Reback, the 
attorney for Barke and the hospital.

POPE TO VISIT TIJUANA, 17 OTHER MEXICAN CITIES NEXT MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II will visit Mexico for eight days next May, including the 
California-Mexican border city of Tijuana and at least 17 other cities, the 
Mexican bishops' conference has announced. 
</P>
<P>
It will be John Paul's second trip to Mexico as Pope and his first to Tijuana, 
where he is expected to end his tour on May 13 before returning to Rome. In his 
January, 1979, Mexico visit, the pontiff warned the Latin American bishops, 
meeting in Puebla, against politicizing the church's mission to promote social 
justice and help the poor. He will return to Puebla on May 9, according to an 
advance schedule released in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City Auxiliary Bishop Genaro Alamilla told a news conference that the 
Pope's visit to the capital city and 13 Mexican states -- representing all 
major regions of Mexico -- will include meetings with laborers, religious and 
lay leaders, journalists and youth. The Pope is expected to address Mexico's 
foreign debt, drug trafficking, the family, abortion and contraception, and 
migration problems. 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing opposition leaders have accused the Roman Catholic Church of using 
the visit to promote political reform of the Mexican Constitution, but Alamilla 
said the visit would be a pastoral one.

GREEN IS FIRED, DENT PROMOTED BY YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was on a quiet morning in spring training that Dallas Green reflected on the 
fact he brought to the New York Yankees a blustery personality similar to that 
of the team owner. 
</P>
<P>
Green said it was a volatile situation that would create an inevitable 
confrontion. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitability recently became a reality, leading Friday to another 
inevitability: Green's firing as manager of the Yankees for apparently refusing 
to make coaching changes that the owner, George Steinbrenner, demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner announced that former shortstop Bucky Dent, manager of the club's 
triple-A affiliate in Columbus, Ohio, for the last three years, will replace 
Green, who was removed with a year remaining on his two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner also fired four of Green's coaches -- Pat Corrales, Lee Elia, 
Charlie Fox and Frank Howard -- although Howard was first offered Dent's job at 
Columbus, which he turned down. Rick Down, a roving hitting instructor who 
formerly coached with the Angels, was selected to replace Dent at Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Green's staff -- bullpen coach John Stearns and pitching coach Billy 
Connors -- were retained by Steinbrenner to work with Dent, while Mike Ferraro 
and Gene Michael were reassigned by the organization and will coach first and 
third base, respectively. Champ Summers, a minor league hitting instructor, 
will join the major league staff in a similar capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The managerial change, coming with the sixth-place Yankees at 56-65 and 7 1/2 
games behind the first-place Baltimore Orioles in the American League East, is 
the 17th since Steinbrenner purchased the team in 1973. Dent became 
Steinbrenner's 11th different manager. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the others -- Billy Martin, Lou Piniella, Clyde King and Michael -- are 
still employed by the Yankees in various capacities. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things never change," Green said Friday, alluding to his firing and the 
Yankees' instability. 
</P>
<P>
Said relief ace Dave Righetti: "I respected Dallas and his coaches. They worked 
hard and I appreciated that. But this just goes with the territory here. We've 
never had it any other way. To me, this is normal -- and that's no joke." 
</P>
<P>
Added first baseman/designated hitter Ken Phelps: "There are six weeks left in 
the season. If they were going to do this, it would have made more sense to 
bring back (former managers) Billy (Martin) or Lou (Piniella), someone more 
familiar with the team." 
</P>
<P>
The latest change took shape two weeks ago when Steinbrenner publicly derided 
Green and his coaching staff for aligning fielders in the wrong places and for 
what he perceived to be a lack of effort by the team. 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken Green refused to back away, calling Steinbrenner "manager George" 
and a second-guesser. Green predicted at the time that he would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Green nor Steinbrenner were available for more than brief statements 
Friday, but Green confirmed that his firing revolved around Steinbrenner's 
desire to make changes in the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, as I always told him, that if he's going to do that, the head 
honcho, the manager, has to go first," Green said, hurrying to leave the team's 
Detroit hotel Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Said Steinbrenner, in a statement released through the team's publicity 
department: "We welcome Bucky, who has worked hard for this chance. I still 
consider Dallas to be a close friend." 
</P>
<P>
Later, while refusing to answer questions, Steinbrenner added: "I made a 
change. I've got nothing critical at all to say about Dallas Green. Perhaps 
there were things I did that disappointed him and things he did that 
disappointed me. I'm sorry that Dallas and I aren't going to see this thing 
through together." 
</P>
<P>
Green, who managed the Philadelphia Phillies to a World Series victory in 1980 
and helped the Chicago Cubs win an Eastern Division title in 1984 as general 
manager, was hired to manage the Yankees on Oct. 7, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first manager selected by Steinbrenner from outside the organization 
and, with the owner's urging, promised a new discipline and team ethic. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees opened the season with a victory in Minnesota, lost their next 
seven games, and have never been more than two games above .500. 
</P>
<P>
Free-agent pitcher Andy Hawkins has been the only constant in a rotation that 
had to be rebuilt after the release of Tommy John and Richard Dotson, injuries 
to Dave LaPoint and John Candelaria and the trade of Al Leiter. The Yankee 
pitching staff had a 4.54 earned-run average -- the American League's worst -- 
going into Friday night's game at Detroit, which New York lost, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
The offense -- decimated by the injury to Dave Winfield, the trade of Jack 
Clark and the free-agent departure of Claudell Washington -- has also been 
inconsistent, with the Yankees trading for Mel Hall, Jesse Barfield and Steve 
Balboni in a modest attempt to improve the production, then finally trading 
Rickey Henderson in hopes of strengthening the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Of Green's firing, second baseman Steve Sax said: "I respect Dallas and feel 
sorry for him. It's been tough with all the injuries and changes. I thought he 
did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Said first baseman Don Mattingly: "Dallas worked hard and he never gave up on 
us. In his heart, I think he really believed we were going to win it. It's too 
early to talk about the timing of this thing. We'll have to see if the change 
turns it around." 
</P>
<P>
Dent, 37, had a 68-62 record this season at Columbus. Dent, who has a 367-344 
record in five seasons of managing -- three at Columbus and two at Class-A Ft. 
Lauderdale, retired as a player in 1984 after 12 seasons in the majors, six 
with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
He had a career batting average of .247, delivering his biggest hit -- a 
three-run homer off Mike Torrez -- in the Yankees' 5-4 victory over the Boston 
Red Sox in the one-game playoff for the 1978 division title, the year the 
Yankees won their last World Series. 
</P>
<P>
New York trailed by 14 games in August of that summer, and Dent said Friday 
that he was confident the 1989 team can overcome its deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about the opportunity and realistic about the pressure and 
problems," he said. "I can only try and do my best for as long as it lasts. I 
know the track record here. I know there are no guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
It was only last February, in fact, that George Steinbrenner was saying that 
Dallas Green faced no problems, that he would still be managing the New York 
Yankees when they won the World Series in October. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

LAS VEGAS MUSICIANS STILL WALK THE BEAT; 
</P>
<P>
11-WEEK STRIKE TO RETAIN LIVE MUSIC 'JUST KEEPS DRAGGING ON' 
</P>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the bad days, when it's so hot he uses his picket sign for shade, Jimmy 
Monroe likens the Las Vegas musicians' strike to the worst possible tune -- 
uninspired Muzak, tasteless disco. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, an 11-year veteran of Las Vegas hotel orchestras, has put down his 
trumpet and hoisted a picket with about 150 other musicians during an 
11-week-old strike, mainly against use of taped music for the floor shows. And 
every day, it's the same old song. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like having a terrible score you have to play over and over again, 
something that stinks from the first note," he sighs, turning from a desert sun 
that routinely puts picketers in a 105-degree spotlight. "It just keeps 
dragging on. You get sick of it, you hate it, but it's got to be done because 
we can't let them do this." 
</P>
<P>
Five major Strip hotels -- Bally's, Caesars Palace, the Tropicana, the Flamingo 
Hilton and the Las Vegas Hilton -- want to use tape extensively in their 
production shows, eliminating many musicians in the process. They also want to 
do away with the 36 work weeks a year guaranteed to musicians in their 
"celebrity" or "star policy" rooms. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the five hotels decided to resume negotiations next week with the 
Musician's Union of Las Vegas, Local 369, in order to avoid a walkout of all 
unionized employees at the Tropicana Hotel before the big Labor Day weekend. 
Earlier this week, the musicians' picket line at Caesars Palace swelled to 500 
when members of other unions joined the march. 
</P>
<P>
On the picket lines, bolstering limp spirits isn't always easy, but there are 
ways. Throughout most evenings, tourists can hear impromptu street concerts -- 
a staccato drum roll, a brief saxophone solo -- from the strikers. They wave 
signs reading "Bring 'M Back Live" and "Honk If You Love Live Music," and the 
horn blasts from appreciative motorists mix in. 
</P>
<P>
"It may sound corny, but sometimes that's the only thing that encourages us," 
says Dave Ringenbach, holding the hand of his picket-carrying son, John, a 
4-year-old brought out to help with his father's current work. 
</P>
<P>
Ringenbach, a 37-year-old percussionist who played with Bally's popular 
"Jubilee" show before the strike started, bangs the drums loudly in front of 
Bally's every night. "To tell the truth, it's a way to get my hostility out. It 
also keeps me jazzed up and able to face all this." 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead of Atlantic City, which replaced live music in its 
production shows a few years ago, the five Las Vegas hotels say they want to 
cut costs, get rid of outdated and expensive work rules, and improve production 
values by using the latest sound technology. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bruny, Bally's publicity coordinator, underscores the need for the new 
contract by pointing out that full bands in the production rooms just aren't 
that necessary. Sometimes the musicians only play briefly, like at the 
beginning or end of a show, and often aren't in view of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
For example, "Jubilee," a razzmatazz show that features 100 singers and 
dancers, has its orchestra play in an underground area two floors beneath the 
actual stage, he noted. Bruny added that a taped sound track figured 
prominently in "Jubilee" even before the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
As for the guaranteed 36 weeks in the headliner rooms, Bruny said the casinos 
must have more flexibility to reduce that number when stars want to bring in 
their own musicians. Why, he asks, should the hotels be forced to pay local 
union musicians if they don't play? 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic contract negotiations have been slow, with little give on either side. 
And the hotels' last substantive offer, guaranteeing jobs for two to four 
musicians at each hotel, didn't impress the 600 active members of Musician's 
Local 369. Under the old contract, a "full orchestra" with a minimum of 13 
musicians was guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
The union believes the casinos, despite their stated commitment to use some 
musicians to augment tape, have signaled the end for local musicians. Without 
these regular jobs, musicians can't make enough money to stay in Las Vegas, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"This would do us in," says Mark Tully Massagli, the union's president. Where 
would we go? Where would we play? "The musicians would have to leave and the 
union would die," 
</P>
<P>
His office in union headquarters is a short walk from the Tropicana, the first 
hotel to be struck when 13 members of the "Folies Bergere" orchestra walked out 
June 3 after the old contract expired June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployed musicians mill around the union's combination cocktail bar and 
rehearsal hall off Tropicana Avenue. A small room dubbed "strike central" is an 
explosion of clutter, mainly picket signs, coffee cups and food wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
In the main hallway, another poster praises Rodney Dangerfield, who on Aug. 3 
refused to cross the lines to work a scheduled engagement at Bally's. The comic 
who never could get any respect gets some here. The sign blurts: "Rodney 
Dangerfield Will Not Cross. He Deserves Our Respect!" 
</P>
<P>
Massagli brings up a much-played refrain, that the hotels' proposal will, in 
the end, affect consumers the most. Canned music (dubbed "McMusic" by the local 
press) can't approach the impact created by spontaneous live performances, he 
says, adding that the casinos risk losing patrons if they persist. 
</P>
<P>
The casinos dismiss that as self-serving and contend most people don't even 
realize the difference. "There was no noticeable changes in (the public's 
reaction to the revamped "Folies") show or the amount of people attending," 
said Ira David Steinberg, the Tropicana's director of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Recent interviews outside the "Jubilee" and "Folies" showrooms supported that. 
Most patrons didn't notice the absence of an orchestra and tended to gush about 
the productions. But most were first-timers who conceded they had nothing to 
compare with. 
</P>
<P>
A few, however, did say the changes were not for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Hetherman, a portly Riverside businessman wearing a yellow "I Love 
Cozumel" T-shirt under a blue blazer, held up a couple of tickets for the 
Flamingo Hilton's "City Lights" show Monday night. He and his wife, April, 
attended "Jubilee" the night before. 
</P>
<P>
"We love the shows, so we see them whenever we come in," he said. "We were a 
little disappointed (Sunday night). It's pretty clear that the musicians do 
make things more interesting. There's just not as much 'oomph' and you don't 
feel quite as involved." 
</P>
<P>
Tourists may still be attending the production shows, but the hotels have been 
hurt in the celebrity rooms. Dangerfield, Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach 
refused to cross pickets lines for their scheduled engagements earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Robert Goulet feels the switch to tape presents a threat to the 
popularity of "name" performers like himself. Goulet, who recently held a press 
conference along with four other Las Vegas regulars urging an end to the 
dispute, said he would never perform without the spontaneity of a live 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with musicians all my life, and, holy mackerel, you just 
can't compare it. A singer like Sinatra needs to have his string sections, he 
needs to have the beautiful background music and balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Performers such as myself, Tony Bennett and Andy Williams may want to change 
tempo. We're not robots, we use our emotions and we just can't perform to taped 
music. I will always be augmented by local musicians. If the hotels continue to 
have star policy, they can't have taped music." 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield isn't the only comic to protest. "It's ridiculous. No celebrity who 
produces music will work with tape," explained Shecky Greene. "There's just no 
spontaneity. If that were to happen they might as well get a mime to go up on 
stage." 
</P>
<P>
Mort Viner, Dean Martin's agent, is a bit more sanguine. "There will never be 
taped music in the celebrity rooms. It's just never going to happen," he said. 
"If that were to happen, they might as well put a record player on stage and 
make the record be the show." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Banke, director of publicity and special events for the Las Vegas Hilton 
-- the only one of the five hotels that has not been picketed, mainly because 
its current production, "Elvis, An American Musical," is a traveling show using 
union musicians from New York -- reiterated that live music will be a mainstay 
in the celebrity rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We have live music and will continue to have live music. We have no intention 
of changing our star policy," Banke said. "Even when Bill Cosby comes to 
perform, we have a live orchestra. We can't present Englebert Humperdick, Barry 
Manilow or Wayne Newton with taped music." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Caesars Palace will not make a switch in its celebrity rooms, said 
Debbie Munch, manager of editorial services. "However if an artist wants to use 
tape in addition to live music, we will give the artist priority." 
</P>
<P>
When the Tropicana reopened "Folies" with a sound track June 2, it marked the 
first time the show had not used live music since it opened in 1959. Thirteen 
musicians and a conducter were eventually fired, saving the hotel a reported 
$600,000 a year. The Tropicana's Steinberg said all were offered severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
Massagli pointed out that since then, a total of 45 jobs have been lost at the 
four struck hotels. "In a nutshell, they're trying to get rid of house 
musicians," said Richard McGee, one of those fired from the Tropicana show. 
</P>
<P>
When not talking about their frustration or anger, the striking musicians often 
discuss what they'll do if they have to leave Las Vegas. Ringenbach, the 
percussionist, said he may start teaching or search for session work in Los 
Angeles. Nicole Atkinson and Daniel Cariaga contributed to this article.

NELSON FREIRE WITH BUCKLEY, PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Competence rather than conviction seemed to characterize the achievement of 
Richard Buckley when the conductor led his second Hollywood Bowl concert 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
For the 36-year-old American musician, the Los Angeles Philharmonic played 
carefully but without maximum interest or energy. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley's program, made up of Shostakovich's "Festive Overture," the second 
suite from Prokofiev's ballet, "Romeo and Juliet," and Rachmaninoff's Third 
Piano Concerto, might have been planned for display. In the event, it revealed 
the conductor's shallowness more than the brilliance of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Returning after an absence of almost 17 1/2 years, Nelson Freire made the 
D-minor Concerto an occasion of triumph. Few pianists conquer its extrovert 
challenges so completely, and effortlessly, while at the same time delivering 
the rich panorama of its inner musical life. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian pianist, now 44, seems to command the full range of 
Rachmaninovian nuance -- which is saying a lot, where the complexities of this 
work are concerned -- plus the digitality and stamina to hold it all together. 
Freire may well be the Jorge Bolet of his generation: a great musician 
disguised as a piano virtuoso. 
</P>
<P>
In the concerto, the Philharmonic players -- before an audience of Rachmaninoff 
lovers counted at 10,179 -- responded nimbly to Freire and Buckley. To 
Shostakovich's cliche-ridden, neo-Tchaikovskyan overture, they provided a crisp 
and bright reading. 
</P>
<P>
Without genuine inspiration emanating from the podium, they moved through the 
"Romeo" excerpts neatly enough, leaving dramatic urgency to come after 
intermission.DANIEL CARIAGA

PHILHARMONIC CONCERT TO SALUTE GREAT FILM MUSIC OF '39 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RACHEL ALTMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, music scores to hundreds of MGM films were dumped in a 
landfill in Sepulveda Pass as part of an "administrative housecleaning." Monday 
night, reconstructions of some of those classic scores will be heard in 
Cahuenga Pass as part of "A Night of Great Movie Music." 
</P>
<P>
Composer David Newman, scion of a prodigious musical family and an admitted 
missionary for film music, will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the 
Hollywood Bowl in a program concentrating on films from 1939, considered by 
many to be the greatest year in American movie history. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old scores to be heard include "Wuthering Heights," written by his 
father, nine-time Oscar-winner Alfred Newman; Max Steiner's "Gone With the 
Wind," and a newly reconstructed 20-minute suite from "The Wizard of Oz," 
scored by Herbert Stothart. 
</P>
<P>
"Film music has been tossed aside and thrown away," said Newman, the 
35-year-old music director of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute in Utah. "We 
want to make people aware of the fact that this music exists, and more 
importantly that it shouldn't be destroyed. It should be available for future 
generations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In 50 years, when it's considered old enough to look at as more than just a 
piece of nothing that was written for a film . . . it should be available at 
the least for a student of film and at most for an orchestra that wants to 
perform it." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the concert will be orchestrator Steve Bernstein's "Wizard 
of Oz" reconstruction, which will include clips from the movie projected on the 
Bowl's 27x45-foot screen. Other film clips to be screened while the 
Philharmonic plays include "Marnie" and "Day for Night." 
</P>
<P>
Composers Maurice Jarre and David Raksin will preside over suites from their 
"Lawrence of Arabia" and "Laura," respectively. And lending the program a more 
contemporary tone, Alan Silvestri will conduct his "Back to the Future." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's performance will be the fifth in a series of concerts to benefit the 
Sundance Institute, where for two weeks each summer Newman teaches a master 
class to young composers. Newman is also on the advisory board of the Los 
Angeles-based Society for the Preservation of Film Music (whose members include 
the Library of Congress, the American Film Institute, UCLA, USC and Brigham 
Young University). 
</P>
<P>
"We're 100% behind the concert," said William Rosar, executive director of the 
preservation society, who lauded Newman's efforts "to ensure the survival of 
the very repertoire he's wanting to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Newman calls his work for Sundance "proselytizing in nature." 
</P>
<P>
"The MGM dumping is only one thing," he says. "What bugs me is that our society 
tends to label things," and considers classical music to be "more artful" than 
film music. 
</P>
<P>
Newman admits that "there's a lot of bad film music, but there's a lot of bad 
classical music. There's a lot of bad everything." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Sundance spent $250,000 to have such scores as Dimitri Tiomkin's 
"It's a Wonderful Life," Max Steiner's "The Searchers," "Wuthering Heights" and 
the "Wizard of Oz" suite reconstructed. Newman hopes its next project will be a 
record of "The Magnificent Ambersons," the troubled 1942 film directed and 
narrated by Orson Welles, which starred Joseph Cotten. "Bernard Herrmann wrote 
a voluminous score, most of which has never been heard." 
</P>
<P>
Newman has heard a lot of film music, not only by his father, but by uncles 
Emil and Lionel Newman and cousin Randy Newman. Of all that he's heard, his 
favorite remains his father's score for "All About Eve" (1950), in which Bette 
Davis plays a famous Broadway actress and Anne Baxter her scheming protege. 
</P>
<P>
"What the music did for the movie," says Newman, as it underscored the 
characters' emotions, had an incredible impact on him. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, he'll sit down this year to score Danny DeVito's "War of the 
Roses," starring Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas; Touchstone Pictures' 
"Gross Anatomy," and Orion's "Madhouse." His score for "Little Monsters," 
starring Howie Mandel, can be heard beginning Friday.

COLORING-BOOK CRITIQUE OF 'AMERICA, THE PERFECT COUNTRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a child in an all-white classroom in the mid-'50s, I watched my teacher pour 
containers filled with white, black and yellow paint into a large glass pot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the melting pot," she said gaily. "All these different races live 
happily together in America." Inside the pot the colors had blended into an 
ugly gray color, but the teacher didn't seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
No era, of course, has a monopoly on bland optimism and blinkered thinking. In 
"America, the Perfect Country" -- at Newport Harbor Art Museum (to Sept. 24) -- 
Los Angeles artist Erika Rothenberg invokes the muddled, unquestioning state of 
public opinion in the age of 10-second spot TV commercials and focus-group 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Using techniques perfected in advertising -- excited slogans, typecast images 
of sex and race, socio-babbling statistics -- she weds perky texts and colorful 
images. All the images have the flat, simplified look of cartoons or coloring 
books, the better to convey the cocoon of happy talk and comforting stereotype 
that enables the average person to tune out negative aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Make the World Perfect" reads the label on the cutout image of an aerosol can 
tilting over another of Rothenberg's story boards. "At last! A way to end war, 
hunger and disease!" trumpets the first panel, awash in aerosol-sprayed smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The next panel shows what life was like "before": a sad-looking black child 
with the swollen belly of malnutrition, a Latina with a black eye comforting a 
morose-looking man, dark-skinned guerrilla fighters, houses billowing with 
smoke, a missile launching. In the "after" panel, a smiling white Mets player 
greets his biracial fans, a white couple gets married, white ballet dancers 
pose and a blond girl with a teddy bear eats an apple. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, nothing has changed except a point of view: Don't think about the 
bad stuff and -- voila! -- it goes away. Rather than simply offering a sweeping 
indictment of fundamentalist right-wing beliefs, however, Rothenberg locates 
the ambivalence in even the most ardent liberal heart. Who has not wished the 
world's problems would quietly solve themselves, so that the pleasant aspects 
of middle-class existence could be pursued without guilt? 
</P>
<P>
The installation, part of the museum's New California Artist series, also 
includes a full-sized, viewer-interactive miniature golf game, "Which Country 
Is the Best Country?," garnished with an eye-catching spinning globe. But, 
although there are six traps, each labeled with the name of a different 
country, all but one ("U.S.A.") have been walled up in various clumsy ways to 
keep balls out. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's point, of course, is that an American's seemingly boundless 
freedom of choice -- in art and other matters -- is contingent upon policies 
that are subject to change. Someone in charge can mess with the game (by 
censoring a potentially controversial exhibition, for example) and thereby 
circumscribe the range of viable choices. 
</P>
<P>
By wrapping her message in such superficially unthreatening visual packages, 
Rothenberg shrewdly gains a lot of ground, co-opting the seductiveness of the 
very media Establishment whose quick fixes and intellectual pabulum she is out 
to discount. 
</P>
<P>
Also part of Newport Harbor's New California Artist series, Fred Fehlau's 
"Blinder Paintings" (to Oct. 1) is an invitation to enter a rigorous dialogue 
about the nature of a work of art. Anyone expecting a dreamy, cosmic experience 
is advised to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Although just as dependent on the viewer's perceptual awareness as "light and 
space" art, Fehlau's work is far more autocratic and unrelentingly 
intellectualized. Each painting offers the viewer a group of sometimes 
conflicting and often hard-to-process visual information that must somehow be 
assimilated and assembled in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
On the panels are various configurations of identical greenish-black painted 
bars that line up perfectly at one point but subsequently fall out of sync. 
There are just enough bars that you can't easily account for them all without 
sending your eyes through dizzying calisthenics. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just for starters. Each surface is composed of two layers, the panel 
and its sailcloth covering, curving (imperceptibly to the eye) in such a way 
that the bars on the sides of the panel read more sharply than those in the 
center. The nylon sailcloth works like a theatrical scrim: veiling the shadowy, 
insubstantial bars painted underneath it on the panel and serving as a backdrop 
to the sharp, textured black bars painted on its outer surface. 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- there's more. Aluminum "blinders" attached at either side of each 
wood panel -- most project from the wall at a 90-degree angle or are 
free-standing -- firmly delimit the viewer's gaze at the work. So you are 
thrust, willy-nilly, into the midst of a shifting play of surfaces and marks 
that refuse to stand still. In addition, each work contains a back-to-back two 
double-surfaced painted panels. Which means that the piece is like a hall of 
mirrors (the light-reflecting aluminum plays its part here too), which 
continually shunt the viewer back and forth in a vain attempt to find a central 
perceptual experience. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the central riddle of this work: It has no center, no inside or 
outside in the conventional senses of those terms. Fehlau's paintings are demon 
constructs of a mind that revels in the play of ideas and shows no mercy for 
the impatient, the merely sensual or the philistine viewer.

STAGE WIRE: A NEW 'ROMEO AND JULIET' IN BLACK AND WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Modern-dress versions of Shakespeare are rife, and usually quite meaningless. 
Yes, "The Taming of the Shrew" can be set in the Wild West, and what does that 
prove? 
</P>
<P>
But picture "Romeo and Juliet" as the love story of a black youth and a white 
girl, keyed to the conditions of a small town in Mississippi. Now picture it 
being performed by an interracial cast in such a town. 
</P>
<P>
That's not meaningless. Robert Coe reports on the production in American 
Theatre magazine. Port Gibson, Miss., was the town, and the production was 
staged by a traveling company called Cornerstone Theatre, using local people as 
well as their own actors. 
</P>
<P>
Port Gibson is legally integrated but culturally segregated, and the "Verona" 
portrayed in the show was the same, with the Montagues (blacks) and the 
Capulets (whites) on different sides of the color line, from which comes the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"A plague on both your races," says the dying Mercutio. And Tybalt's taunting 
"Thou art a villain" becomes "Thou art a nigger." The updates made community 
leaders nervous, and so did the fact that the kids in the cast were doing some 
interracial partying after the show, which is not the style in Port Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
But the show went well -- riotously well, in the fight scenes. And it got 
people thinking about the parallels between their town and the one in the 
story. "No one knows if (the production's) spirit will last," Coe writes -- but 
no one believed it would happen in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Henley's turf is also Mississippi. Henley's "The Debutante Ball," which 
had its premiere at South Coast Repertory in 1985, opened in London in June, at 
the Hampstead Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
James Christopher in Time Out was exhilarated by Henley's whacked-out 
characters: "It's like watching a showdown at the OK Corral between Sigmund 
Freud and Agatha Christie, where everyone gets shredded in the cross-fire." 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Coveney of the Financial Times found another comparison: "Like 
viewing 'Cinderella' through a distorting glass supplied by Charles Addams and 
populated around the lens by would-be participants in 'The Munsters.' I only 
wish it had been as funny as I make it sound." 
</P>
<P>
And most of the critics were with Coveney. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: David Richards of the Washington Post on Mandy Patinkin's 
new one-man show, "Dress Casual": "An ideal concert for people who are of the 
opinion that Liza Minnelli, as an entertainer, tends to hold back."

CACTI SOLVE PRICKLY WATER PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cactus has been stuck with a bad reputation ever since settlers first set 
foot onto Western soil -- and into the pointy needles of the spiny plant. But 
early ranchers wasted no time in finding practical uses for them: the "prickly 
pear" cactus was commonly used to fence in animals (or to keep trespassers 
out); some types are edible, and in times of desperation, a cactus can even be 
a source of water. 
</P>
<P>
As Southern California faces yet another water crisis, gardeners looking for 
ways to conserve water may not have to look any further than their own back 
yards. Cacti and succulents can add symmetry, texture and color to a landscape 
-- and all the while conserve water during the dry summer months because of 
their ability to store water. 
</P>
<P>
But drought tolerance is just one appealing quality, says Larry Grammer, who 
grows more than 800 cacti and succulents in his greenhouse and outside of his 
Long Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baja the Turning Point 
</P>
<P>
A trip to Baja California in the '70s influenced Grammer's choice of plants. 
The Texaco oil refinery worker was a house-plant and yard man up to that point, 
but his introduction to the cactus in Mexico had a lasting impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I was camped in the middle of them and looking at their spines, formations and 
the geometric-type patterns -- the way they clumped and criss-crossed," he 
recalls. "That one trip changed my mind, and they weren't even in flower." 
</P>
<P>
But it's typically a cactus in bloom that makes a cactus convert, says John 
Trager, curator of the desert collection at Huntington Botanic Gardens (one of 
the largest and most diverse collections in the world, with more than 5,000 
species). "What usually appeals to people is the brightly colored flowers 
coming out of these unusual plant forms -- they're beautiful," Trager says. 
</P>
<P>
Cacti can be grown indoors and out; they range in size from tiny button-size 
(from Argentina) to hulking 300-pounders (the Huntington has samples of these). 
</P>
<P>
Get a good look at more than 1,000 cacti and succulents at the fourth 
Inner-City Cactus &amp; Succulent Show and Sale going on at the L.A. Arboretum 
today and Sunday. "The public will see things at the show that are 
magnificently grown," Trager says. "They'll see the results of good care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pooling Resources 
</P>
<P>
Grammer is show chairman for the Long Beach Cactus &amp; Succulent Club, one of 
three clubs pooling resources to put on the show. Though he grows his plants 
partially for the enjoyment and relaxation, a competitive streak surfaces at 
show time, as he enters his own prize plants in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the show," Grammer says. "The show is there to educate the 
public, but it's also nice to show off your hobby." 
</P>
<P>
Trager says two of the most common mistakes gardeners make is overwatering a 
cactus and assuming it will take care of itself. "The No. 1 problem is a lack 
of fertilizer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer uses a porous mixture of pumice, a "little bit" of sand and potting mix 
to grow show-quality cactus. "I water once a week in summer (the growing 
period) and I stop watering in November and let them rest till March 1," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
This might surprise some gardeners, but the cactus' ability to survive without 
water is one of the qualities that makes it so practical for the Southern 
California climate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overwatering Can Kill 
</P>
<P>
"Watering too much at the wrong time of the year can really hurt," Grammer 
says. "They withstand the cold better when dry." If the roots are wet and the 
weather turns cold, it "will kill them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the plants to look for at the show include agaves and aloes, both 
succulents, the golden barrel cactus and cereus cactus. 
</P>
<P>
"These grow very well in almost any garden situation," Trager says, "as long as 
they're not overwatered. They certainly provide unusual and different design 
potential . . . mixing in well with other garden plants."

DAY HIKE!: A STROLL THROUGH THE PINES: SAN DIEGO'S MIDDLE PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Middle Peak, in the middle of the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County, is 
the place for a summer saunter if you like tall trees. Encircling the peak are 
big specimens of silver fir and cedar, plus Coulter, sugar, Ponderosa and 
Jeffrey pines. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuyamacas' geographical location between coast and desert makes these 
mountains an unusual ecosystem. The 4,000- to 6,500-foot peaks host rich 
conifer forests. Cuyamaca Rancho State Park protects much of the mountains, 
which are a delight for bird watchers because desert, coastal and mountain 
species are all found in the range. 
</P>
<P>
Centerpiece of the park -- and of the Cuyamaca Mountains -- is a chain of three 
forested peaks: North, Middle and Cuyamaca. Cuyamaca Peak, at 6,512 feet, is 
the highest summit in the range and offers the best views. Most of North Peak 
(5,993 feet) is on private property. Middle Peak (5,883 feet) has the best 
trail network and the tallest trees. 
</P>
<P>
The hike around Middle Peak uses several trails; one good path that ascends the 
north side of the peak is Sugar Pine Trail. Utilizing this trail and a couple 
of others, it's possible to make several loops of varying distances around 
Middle Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: This hike begins at a parking area off California 
79 in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. The parking area is opposite the Boy Scouts' 
Camp Hual-Cu-Cuisi. If you're traveling California 79 south to the state park, 
the trailhead is about 10 miles from Julian. If you're heading north on 
California 79, the trailhead is located 5 miles north of park headquarters and 
1 1/2 miles north of the entrance to Paso Pichacho Camp/Picnic Area. The 
parking area is located at a nearly right-angle bend in the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the trail is easy to spot; it's the road across from the parking 
area that leads through the Boy Scout camp. The unsigned beginning of the trail 
is more difficult to find. Look on the left (west) side of California 79 for a 
path that parallels the highway. Can't find it? Walk 75 yards or so north up 
the highway, then head left, dip in and out of a roadside drainage ditch, and 
you'll pick up the trail heading north. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Minshall is the name of the unsigned trail that parallels California 
79. Looking east, the most obvious geographical feature is Cuyamaca Reservoir. 
Before the dam was built creating the reservoir, Cuyamaca Lake, as it was 
called, was a sometime affair. Indians never trusted it as a dependable water 
source, and the Spanish referred to it as la laguna que deseco, "the lake that 
dries up." During dry years like this one, there's more meadow than reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
After half a mile, the trail skirts Lakeland Resort and turns west. Signs 
inform you that you're now on the way to Middle Peak and that you're entering a 
state park wilderness area. Your path, a retiring dirt road now known as Sugar 
Pine Trail, begins ascending into the pines. At lower elevations, the pines mix 
it up with oak woodland. 
</P>
<P>
A short mile's ascent on Sugar Pine Trail brings you to a junction with Middle 
Peak fire road. If a 3-mile loop is plenty for you this day, turn left on the 
fire road and follow it down to the Boy Scout camp and the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, continue on Sugar Pine Trail past some fine specimens of Southern 
California's largest native pine. The bark of these trees is reddish brown and 
deeply furrowed into scaly plates. Sugar pines have larger branches and cones 
than their somewhat similar-looking Middle Peak neighbors, the Ponderosa pines. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing the halfway point of the hike, the trail passes the stone foundation 
ruins of an old cabin, turns southwest and comes to a signed junction. 
</P>
<P>
You join Middle Peak Loop Road, which at first curves west, then heads south. 
Middle Peak itself is possible to ascend, but trees and shrubs prevent any kind 
of view of Cuyamaca country. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Peak Loop Road descends out of the pines to Milk Ranch Road. Bear left 
on this dirt fire road, which crosses oak-dotted meadowland. You'll get a 
feeling for the "rancho" part of the state park. The dirt road becomes gravel, 
skirts the Boy Scout camp and brings you back to California 79 and the 
trailhead.

CELEBRATING HAWAII'S STATEHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
A GREAT LUAU DEPENDS ONLY ON THE HOSTESS'S IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RHONDA BRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it seems like any excuse would do for a luau, such tropical-themed 
outdoor celebrations should be in full bloom this weekend, because Monday is 
the 30th anniversary of Hawaii's statehood. 
</P>
<P>
With plenty of resources at local party-favor shops and ethnic grocery stores 
-- perhaps catering to the 150,000 estimated Hawaiians in Los Angeles -- 
Angelenos can easily bring a little of the 50th state into their neck of the 
tropics. Just fill up the back yard or patio with flowers, palms and lots of 
greenery, and bring a little ingenuity, an easy, hang-loose attitude and plenty 
of aloha, which translates into "love" as well as "hello" and "goodby." 
</P>
<P>
"It (a luau) is our way of being together, sharing with loved ones and just 
having a good time," said Loretta Mangold, an organizer of luau shows for 20 
years, who hosts elaborate ones of her own. "It's very relaxed; living is much 
slower. The people are always close to nature -- the sand and the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles about 2,500 miles from the islands, luaus here may be of a 
more mainland variety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Have to Adapt 
</P>
<P>
"You have to adapt to whatever's available in your environment," said Honolulu 
native Carmen Postrzech, co-founder and president of the 18-year-old San 
Fernando Valley Hawaiian Club. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mangold, whose Playa del Rey patio is decked with papayas, 
plumerias, a macadamia nut tree, ginger, taro, a ti bush and other exotic 
plants native to the islands, "You can't have too many decorations -- 
especially greenery." 
</P>
<P>
First, scout your yard and the yards of your friendly neighbors for flowers and 
shrubbery, or visit a flower shop or the downtown flower mart. While 
carnations, Boston ferns, gardenias and orchids are the most tropic-like, Doris 
Keawe, luau chairwoman for the Wilmington-based L.A. Polynesian Society, 
insists that "whatever you can get your hands on is fine." Yellow hibiscus is 
the state flower of Hawaii, but Postrzech doesn't recommend them for evening 
luaus because "they close at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
One might also visit a party-goods or stationery store for invitations to match 
the tropical theme, along with napkins and plates. Other luau paper novelties 
include cardboard cut-outs of hula dancers and palm trees, and crepe-paper 
sculptures of pineapples and ribbonfish. And, one shouldn't forget those 
ubiquitous plastic floral leis and garlands. Bananas, coconuts, mangos and 
papayas make great table centerpieces, especially when arranged inside 
pineapple or coconut halves used as fruit bowls. Wicker baskets also make 
tropical-looking fruit containers. (The bowls can be filled with diced fruit 
speared by colorful toothpicks.) Other creative decorations include sea shells, 
which look great in fish netting or as ashtrays. 
</P>
<P>
One might set out souvenirs brought back from Hawaii, such as shell necklaces, 
ukeleles or drums. Lily pads and other floating plants can line the swimming 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
Tiki and wooden ornaments, as well as anything made of bamboo or wicker, "makes 
it look really Polynesian," says Keawe, who moved to Los Angeles from Honolulu 
in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
For a warm nighttime glow, install bamboo posts with tiki torches and place 
colored-glass lanterns on tables. The more ambitious might want to construct a 
little grass hut over the bar area and draft a bartender who can whip up fruity 
tropical drinks. 
</P>
<P>
A luau is a feast, so eating should rank high among the festivities. The food 
can be as ethnically mixed as the Hawaiians themselves, with elements from 
various countries. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have adapted menus to their own taste," Postrzech said. "There 
are a lot of (Hawaiian) dishes people here don't eat," Meat, often roast pork, 
short ribs or chicken, is usually cooked teriyaki-style or grilled as kebabs. 
Side dishes might include rice and sweet potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want a more Hawaiian flair may try the trademark staple: poi, the 
mushy, grayish goo that looks like papier-mache paste (it's made from the root 
of the taro plant and mixed with water). But Hawaiians themselves admit it's 
bland and takes an acquired taste, even when sweetened with cream or sugar. 
Other Hawaiian dishes include lomi lomi salmon (fish marinated with green 
onions and tomatoes) and saimin (wheat noodles in broth). Coconut pudding or 
sheet cake is the dessert de rigueur. Poo poos (hors d'oeuvres) may consist of 
sweet breads, fruit salad and madacamia nuts, one of Hawaii's main exports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Delicacy 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists may want to serve the ultimate Hawaiian delicacy, a kalua pig, 
which is roasted underground in a pit over lava rocks. Preparation takes more 
than a day and is undoubtedly a lot of work. Postrzech, who now cooks hers in 
an oven, said: "It got to be too much of a hassle. You can't get lava rocks 
here unless you bring them back from Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Keawe, who owns a Hawaiian-style restaurant in Wilmington with her husband, 
Joe, advises hosts to order the pig from a restaurant or caterer. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing is casual and colorful; women wear the roomy muumuus or midriffs with 
sarongs (floral-print wraparound skirts), and men wear loose wildflower shirts 
and shorts. Or, Mangold suggests, good-humored guests may opt to look like 
tourists in Hawaii, with white pants, straw hats, sunglasses -- and leis or 
cameras around their necks. Children might want to dress up as hula dancers, 
with grass skirts, leis and flowers in their hair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Hospitality 
</P>
<P>
Just as vacationers to Hawaii are greeted with flower leis, your guests can be 
greeted with "aloha," and then draped with a lei. "When you present someone 
with a lei, always with a kiss, always," emphasized Postrzech, who attends 
about 10 luaus a year. Guests can be made to feel like kings walking between 
feathered staffs, which represent royalty, on each side of the entryway.

Entertainment, which often tells the story of Hawaii, can range from one 
performer dancing to taped music to a 10-person choreographed troupe 
accompanied by a four-piece band. It all depends on your budget and how much 
you want to impress. Elaborate bands typically include a steel guitar, drums, 
the ever-present ukelele (which is Hawaiian for "jumping flea") and a Hawaiian 
vocalist a la Don Ho. 
</P>
<P>
Hula dancers, who move like swaying palms to the beat of the drum, demonstrate 
dances and costumes of all the islands, with props including drums, feather 
gourds and bamboo sticks. For extra excitement, some male Samoan dancers 
perform with fire and knives, twirling and flipping their props into the air 
like jugglers and touching hot fire to their tongues and feet. Troupes, which 
typically perform half-hour to one-hour shows, should be booked three months in 
advance during the high-demand summer. Check regional magazines, the Yellow 
Pages under "Entertainers."

This time of year, one might hear a verse of Hawaii's national song, "Hawaii 
Pono'i," which means "Hawaii, together, we stand."

<P>
Four men pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of conspiracy and attempting to 
illegally export weapons to what they allegedly thought was a Mexican drug 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The two U. S. citizens and two Mexican nationals made their pleas during an 
arraignment before U. S. Magistrate Barry Moskowitz. 
</P>
<P>
The four were indicted last week by a federal grand jury, after federal 
officials had completed investigating the seizure of 97 Chinese-made AK-47 
assault rifles Aug. 8 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The four people named in the indictment are Jose Luis Rodriguez, 27, a 
naturalized U. S. citizen living in San Diego; Adam Danile Hahn, 25, of Irvine; 
Mario Lopez-Gutierrez, a resident alien living in Chula Vista; and Enrique 
Gobea-Rabago, 25, an undocumented alien living in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn is the only one now free -- on a $150,000 property bond, but Assistant U. 
S. Atty. David L. Katz said he expects Rodriguez to be released this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The four will again appear in federal court Sept. 5, when a judge will set a 
trial date. 
</P>
<P>
The two-count indictment alleges that the semiautomatic rifles were legally 
purchased before the federally mandated restrictions on assault rifles, and 
that Hahn, part owner of Guns 'N' Stuff in Orange County, agreed to sell the 
unregistered weapons to his co-defendants, who allegedly thought they were 
going to sell the guns to Mexico-based drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents had arranged to purchase the rifles from Lopez and Rodriguez for 
$700 each. Also involved in the deal were 8,000 rounds of ammunition, according 
to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of both counts, each defendant could be sentenced to a maximum of 
15 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine.

<P>
The trial of eight anti-abortion activists charged with trespassing during 
protests at San Diego-area clinics began Friday amid a continuous stream of 
objections from prosecutors and defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Gregory Anthony and Daniel Winfree said Friday in San Diego 
Municipal Court that the protesters were involved in "peaceful political 
activity" -- an exception to the city code under which the activists were 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is considered a prelude to the cases of 134 activists who have been 
charged with more serious misdemeanors stemming from protests April 8, 29 and 
June 10. The first of those trials begins next Wednesday in Municipal Court, 
involving eight activists charged with conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the trespass charges, the eight now on trial each could be 
sentenced to a maximum of a $250 fine. The case resumes Monday before court 
Commissioner James L. Duchnick.

<P>
Marvin (Bad News) Barnes, a former professional basketball player, was arrested 
at his East San Diego apartment Thursday on suspicion of shoplifting in two 
separate incidents, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Employees and customers at the Adult Book and Video store, in the 4000 block of 
El Cajon Boulevard, identified Barnes from a photographic lineup as the man who 
stole videos July 29, then came back the next day and stole ladies' lingerie, 
police spokesman Dave Cohen said. Further investigation led to Barnes' arrest 
at his apartment, in the 4000 block of 42nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 37, was booked into County Jail on two felony counts of petty theft 
with a prior conviction. He was convicted in May on a burglary charge and 
served 31 days, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' prowess as a basketball forward for such teams as the Detroit Pistons, 
the Buffalo Braves and the Boston Celtics was always shadowed by trouble with 
the law. In 1974, as a senior at Providence College in Rhode Island, Barnes 
pleaded guilty to assaulting a teammate with a tire iron in an incident two 
years earlier -- hence the nickname "Bad News." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 6-foot-9, 225-pound Barnes has been in and out of jail on 
various charges, including drug possession and eluding police in a high-speed 
chase. In 1980, he spent four days in a Trieste, Italy, jail on a charge of 
giving false testimony in connection with a cocaine party he allegedly 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes moved to San Diego in 1980 when he signed a 10-day contract with the San 
Diego Clippers. He will be arraigned Monday in Superior Court.

GUARD LINKED TO SEX WITH FEMALE INMATE

<P>
A guard at the Metropolitan Correctional Center was charged Friday with having 
sex with a female inmate, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Carmond E. McNeil, 31, of San Ysidro was charged in a one-count indictment with 
engaging in sexual activity with a woman who was serving a 2-year sentence 
stemming from a drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who has been a senior correctional officer at MCC for about two years, 
is expected to be arraigned next week, Assistant U. S. Atty. Gregory A. Vega 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, McNeil could be sentence to a maximum of one year in prison and 
up to $100,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were led to McNeil after another guard on rounds observed 
something "unusual," Vega said.

200 CAUGHT IN BAJA, S.D. POLICE NET 
</P>

<P>
A group of 60 Baja California State Judicial Police swooped down Friday evening 
on a major illegal crossing zone along the U.S.-Mexican border, arresting about 
200 people as they waited to enter the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was coordinated with the U.S. Border Patrol and San Diego Police 
Department, said Jose Encinas Filatoff, chief of a homicide squad of the state 
police in Tijuana. The raid, he said, was an attempt to cut down on violent 
crime along the border. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong operation, involving 60 state police agents and more than 3 dozen 
vehicles, occurred along a milelong slough of the international border near the 
banks of the Tijuana River. The area -- believed to be the largest single 
crossing zone for undocumented immigrants along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican 
border -- has also been the site of many violent attacks on migrants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going After Thieves...' 
</P>
<P>
"We're going after the thieves and the murderers and rapists," said Encinas, 
who spoke at state police headquarters in Tijuana as the 200 arrestees were 
being questioned in a nearby conference room. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's operation was not the first such joint operation but it was by far the 
largest one involving state police, and the most thoroughly planned. There has 
been at least one similar operation earlier this year involving federal police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were checking those detained to see if they had any weapons or 
criminal records. Those who did not appear to be violent were to be released, 
Encinas said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going after people because they're immigrants," Encinas said. 
</P>
<P>
However, several people who were arrested maintained that they were committing 
no crime under Mexican law but only wished to enter the United States to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came here to cross, and I found this," said one arrestee, as he headed 
down from the Tijuana River levee into a waiting police truck that would take 
him downtown. 
</P>
<P>
At the scene, U.S. Border Patrol officers standing on the U.S. side of the 
tattered border fence occasionally pointed out suspects to Mexican police 
officers. But Border Patrol agents at the scene declined to comment on the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operation El Bordo 
</P>
<P>
Mexican police dubbed the joint crackdown Operation El Bordo. In Tijuana, the 
area is known as El Bordo -- literally, the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Such joint operations between U. S. and Mexican authorities have drawn 
considerable criticism in Mexico, where U. S. police agencies, particularly the 
Border Patrol, are viewed as violators of the rights of undocumented Mexicans 
in the United States. U. S. officials have disputed this characterization. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticism, state police plan to continue raids. Chief Encinas said 
he would like to see similar raids every two weeks or so, to dissuade criminals 
from frequenting the Tijuana River area. 
</P>
<P>
"We want that place cleaned up," Encinas said. He shrugged off criticism of 
working jointly with U.S. authorities, contending that both sides were working 
for the safety of the undocumented migrants who are preyed upon along the 
border zone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Converged on Levee 
</P>
<P>
The operation began at about 7:30 p.m., when state judicial police cars, mostly 
unmarked, converged on the river levee area from several directions. Dozens of 
judicial police officers, armed with semi-automatic pistols, mounted the 
elevated levee and began rounding up everyone in sight -- including women and 
children. Many tried to scurry -- some successfully -- for the nearby Tijuana 
neighborhood known as the Zona Norte, across the street from the levee. 
</P>
<P>
Police said all women with children were later released. 
</P>
<P>
Migrants say they have learned to avoid state and local police, who they 
contend frequently shake down the undocumented border crossers. But Encinas 
denied that his officers would attempt to extort any migrants, saying all of 
their belongings would be returned to them.

AUTO, OIL FIRMS JOIN FORCES TO CLEAN UP AIR; 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRY LEADERS HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENE TO IMPROVE FUEL, ENGINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While state and federal officials move ahead with clean air proposals, leaders 
of the Big Three domestic auto makers and several major oil companies have been 
quietly meeting on their own to discuss forming a task force to research and 
develop low-emission fuels and engines. 
</P>
<P>
Top executives of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and 
several oil companies last met on July 20 in Detroit to discuss setting up the 
task force to look into ways to meet clean air requirements proposed by the 
Bush Administration, said Arthur E. Wiese, a spokesman for the American 
Petroleum Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, lower-level officials of both industries also have talked 
about ways to meet clean air targets. Auto and oil companies favor meeting such 
goals by reformulating gasoline and modifying existing auto systems rather than 
by resorting to the use of alternative fuels, such as methanol, ethanol or 
compressed natural gas. On Tuesday, Atlantic Richfield Co. announced the 
introduction of reformulated gasoline for use in pre-1975 cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Reason to Be Skeptical' 
</P>
<P>
"Modifications to existing fuels and automobile engines simply make more sense 
than betting on drastic life-style alterations and unknown technological 
developments," said James S. Morrison, Arco executive vice president, in 
testimony before the South Coast Air Quality Management District late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But air quality officials have said they doubt that any reformulated gasoline 
could result in emissions reductions comparable to those possible under 
methanol or other alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
"Since there was not a lot of talk about reformulated gasoline as part of a 
real effort to help us clean up the air until the alternate fuels program had a 
lot of momentum, there's some reason to be skeptical about it," said Karl 
Hellman, who heads the emissions control technology branch of the Environmental 
Protection Agency's lab in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The joint industry task force would also look into methanol and other 
alternative fuels, said Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for Arco. 
</P>
<P>
The two industries have not reached agreement yet on the shape of the task 
force and may have conflicting goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit meeting included Richard M. Morrow, chairman and chief executive of 
Amoco Corp. and chairman of the API; Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman and chief 
executive of Arco; Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive of Chevron 
Corp.; Frank H. Richardson, president and chief executive of Shell Oil Co.; 
James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive of Texaco Inc.; Roger B. Smith, 
chairman and chief executive of General Motors; Harold Poling, vice chairman 
and chief operating officer of Ford, and Gerald Greenwald, vice chairman of 
Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Unocal Corp. and other oil companies have become involved in the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resisted Methanol 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting among the top executives may be in the works, said Mike Libbey, 
a spokesman for Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers have argued that mandating alternative fuels would require major 
redesign of existing vehicles and that production might not be feasible until 
after 1995. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, oil companies have resisted methanol as the alternative fuel of 
choice. Besides requiring massive investments in new refineries and pipelines, 
the use of methanol would raise serious questions about public safety and 
health, the companies argue. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can make big improvements in gasoline, the need to get quickly to 
alternative fuels may not be as great since a lot of issues still have to be 
resolved with them," Joseph M. Colucci, head of the fuels and lubricants 
department at General Motors, said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The joint meetings among top oil and auto executives have been precedent 
setting, Wiese said. But agreement between the two groups may be hard in 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
When Morrison spoke to the AQMD in December, he predicted optimistically that a 
coalition of energy companies would reach agreement with auto makers within 90 
days on a project to develop cleaner automobile engine systems based on current 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want Improved Engines Too 
</P>
<P>
Eight months later, "there is no agreement on table at this point; we're still 
in the talking stages," said Donald R. Buist, director of automotive emissions 
and fuel economy for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Emissions experts at the auto companies argue that the major improvements will 
have to come from reformulated fuels, adding that auto makers have carried most 
of the burden of recent smog mandates. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be some greater interest on the part of the petroleum industry," 
said GM's Colucci. "If they can make gasoline into an alternative fuel, the 
crude in the ground and the refineries that convert it into gasoline will still 
have great utility." 
</P>
<P>
Oil company officials argue that improvements must come in both engines and 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easier to ask the other industry to do the job," said Gordon E. 
Allardyce, executive engineer in charge of certification and regulatory 
programs with Chrysler. "But everyone recognizes that everyone has to do his 
share," he said.

HOW MUCH IS A COMPANY'S PHONE BOOK WORTH? AT THE VERY LEAST, $30 
</P>

<P>
The chairman and chief executive of F. W. Woolworth Co., Harold Sells, lives in 
Murray Hill, N.J. Seven miles away, in Florham Park, Woolworth's president and 
chief operating officer, Frederick Hennig, resides. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. partner Lloyd Blankfein has two homes, one in 
Manhattan and the other in East Hampton, N.Y. Another Goldman partner, Fischer 
Black, has homes in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Pittsfield, Mass. And David Beemer, 
managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has a penthouse in 
Guttenberg, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Those are but a few of America's least approachable corporate executives whose 
home addresses and, in many cases, home telephone numbers, are for sale by 
Steve Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Operating out of his cluttered two-room suite in Hotel Rutledge, a small 
Manhattan residential hotel, Olsen, 25, is one of a small group of 
entrepreneurs who buy, sell and swap corporate telephone directories. 
</P>
<P>
He specializes in Fortune 500 companies and financial institutions. An 
associate, Stanley Grubman, in Silver Spring, Md., also sells directories of 
Fortune 500 companies, plus many Washington Beltway high-technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Runs a Regular Ad 
</P>
<P>
Olsen regularly runs a two-line ad in New York Press, a weekly, that says: "We 
pay cash for internal phone directories of large companies." He pays $30 to $50 
a book and sells photocopies for $50 to $100, he said. Those answering his ad, 
he said, come from every level -- from the mail room to the executive suite. 
</P>
<P>
Not all in-house directories include home numbers -- those that do command 
higher prices -- and a sampling indicates that most of the home numbers in 
company directories also are listed in local telephone books. 
</P>
<P>
But the company directory still is valuable, because without it, someone 
tracking an elusive executive would need to know which phone book to go to: 
Greenwich, Conn., for example, for the home listing of Hugh Garnett, partner at 
the accounting firm of Deloite, Haskins &amp; Sells; or Randolph, N.J., for a 
listing for George Miles Jr., the executive vice president and chief operations 
officer of WNET, Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Companies 
</P>
<P>
Olsen estimates that his more than 300 directories contain 4 million to 5 
million names. Among the companies on his seven-page, single-spaced list of 
phone lists are: 
</P>
<P>
American Broadcasting, CBS, NBC, Aetna, Continental Insurance, Metropolitan

He also acquired one particularly hot property: the spring 1989 directory of 
Time Inc. He sold it shortly before Time's takeover woes began but insists that 
the buyer had nothing to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
Among Olsen's most productive resources are the "alumni directories" kept by 
many companies, especially management consulting and accounting firms, which 
keep track of where their valued former managers have gone. Those books are 
especially rich in home and summer-home telephone numbers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Olsen's customers are executive recruiters stalking management and 
technical personnel for finders' fees of up to a year's salary. "They want to 
be able to talk to their candidate directly, either at home or on his direct 
office line, without explaining to a secretary who they are and what they 
want," Olsen said. He added that he often will offer to sell directories to 
buyers at a lower price if they have some new directory to offer him in 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Grubman said 90% of his clientele are stockbrokers seeking new sales prospects. 
"If someone is listed as management in a company phone book, they can probably 
afford to buy stock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Lord, managing editor of Executive Recruiter News, confirmed that 
corporate recruiters are avid collectors of in-house phone books. It is general 
practice, Lord said, for a headhunter, having lured an executive away from XYZ 
Inc. for a better berth at ABC Co., to ask the recruit, as a favor, to drop off 
a copy of his old XYZ phone book. 
</P>
<P>
"We take a rather dim view of the practice," Lord said. "It is a violation of 
the confidence of the firm. . . . Also, in a good executive search, original 
research is the preferred method. And you do that by sourcing. You develop 
names based on personal recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expressing Displeasure 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Woolworth's, IBM and General Motors also are annoyed at the 
practice. Joseph Carroll, Woolworth's vice president for public affairs, 
expressed displeasure that his company book was for sale. He said any employee 
caught selling a company directory to someone like Olsen would be reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
A GM spokesman said his company's phone book bears a warning that outsiders are 
not to see it, and the book is to be destroyed when a new one is issued. 
</P>
<P>
Even a copyright, Olsen said, wouldn't protect the companies unless they sold 
the books themselves. Only then, he said, could they claim that his photocopies 
deprived them of profits. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime," Olsen said, "I've got a pretty good thing going here. Some 
day I'll get the money to have all of this cross-indexed and computerized: Can 
you imagine what a data base I'll have? Direct lines to millions of the most 
powerful people in the world."

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street's blue chips rose modestly Friday, helped by a late burst of 
computer-directed buying, while transportation issues surged on takeover fever 
to end the week at record levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.34 points to finish at 2,687.97, a 
gain of 3.98 points on the week. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the market's biggest gains were concentrated in the transport 
sector. The Dow Jones transportation average jumped 14.05 points to a record 
1,442.39, helped by speculation that a bidding war may emerge for UAL Corp., 
the parent of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 145.81 million shares, down from 
157.56 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 776 issues up, 661 down and 544 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened weaker in response to a slide in the bond market after a Labor 
Department report on consumer prices that raised concern about the inflation 
outlook over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's consumer price index rose 0.2% in July, in line with the 
market consensus. But without food and energy costs, the most volatile 
components of the index, consumer prices rose a heftier 0.4%, raising inflation 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks firmed slightly at midday as bonds turned higher and by late afternoon 
prices were strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
But uncertainty about the impact of the the so-called double witching hour -- 
the expiration of stock-index futures and options that don't expire quarterly 
-- dampened the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that at least three parties are interested in acquiring UAL pushed up 
the airline company's stock 4 5/8 to 271. Besides Marvin Davis, who has bid 
$275 a share for UAL, rumored potential suitors include Texas investor Robert 
M. Bass and another group that includes Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and British 
Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Other airlines benefited from the takeover talk. AMR rose 3/8 to 76 1/8, Delta 
Air Lines gained 1 3/4 to 77, USAir added 1/8 to 50 5/8 and Texas Air rose 1 
3/8 to 19 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw-Hill rose 6 to 85 1/2 on renewed speculation that it may be the target 
of a takeover or leveraged buyout. The company declined to comment on the rise 
in its stock. 
</P>
<P>
C. R. Bard fell 1 1/2 to 20 after the company said it had stopped shipments of 
its new Probe angioplasty catheter pending Food and Drug Administration review 
and approval. 
</P>
<P>
Bard said it expects that the development will cut into its profits, leading 
several brokerage firms, including Prudential-Bache, Shearson Lehman and Piper 
Jaffray, to lower their annual earnings estimates for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Sci-Med Life, which also makes catheters, benefited from Bard's troubles. Its 
shares jumped 12 1/8 to 48 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia-Gulf climbed 3 1/2 to 54 1/2 on news that investor Harold Simmons, who 
owns about 9.4% of the company, is considering seeking control. 
</P>
<P>
Maytag rose 1 3/4 to 23 1/4 on a report that it may be a takeover target. 
Analysts said Chicago businessman Lester Crown, who owns a 5.5% stake in 
Maytag, is rumored to be planning to buy more shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market took a breather, closing mixed in thin trading, after 
jumping to record highs earlier this week. The key Nikkei 225-share index 
dipped 26.97 points to close at 35,063.14. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices continued climbing, as bullish corporate news, 
encouraging economic data and scattered speculative buying pushed the main 
index to a 1989 high. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 15.1 points 
higher at 2,375.1. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished mixed as buying by bargain hunters offset the early 
declines that followed the consumer inflation report. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term Treasury and corporate bonds edged up, but prices of 
shorter-term Treasury issues and tax-exempt bonds slipped. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/16 point, or less 
than $1 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield dipped to 8.15% from 8.16% 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term issues lost 
1/8 point, intermediate securities fell 3/32 point and long-term issues rose as 
much as 3/32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.875%, unchanged from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped in worldwide trading as dealers cashed in on the currency's 
dramatic run-up in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery lost 20 cents to finish at $368.10 an ounce. Republic National 
Bank of New York said gold was bid later at $366 an ounce, down 20 cents from 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Buying interest in the dollar abated following the climb triggered by 
Thursday's release of a better-than-expected U.S. trade report for July, which 
boosted the U.S. currency to levels not seen since its most recent rally in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar is right back to where we were before the trade number came out," 
said Michael McDonald, a trader with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders characterized the Labor Department's consumer price index 
report a non-event since it was largely within expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.52 Japanese yen, up from 142.32. 
Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 142.75 yen. In New York, the dollar 
closed at 142.60 yen, down from 143.53 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.5655 late Friday, more expensive for 
buyers than Thursday's late $1.5590. In New York, one pound cost $1.5659, more 
expensive than $1.5605 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were higher overseas. In London, gold closed at $366.65 bid an 
ounce, up from $366.35. The Zurich closing price was $366.75, up from $365.25. 
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $366.50 bid, up from $366.45. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Profit taking put an end to a seven-day run-up in copper futures prices Friday 
on New York's Commodity Exchange but chart-watchers said technical signals 
pointed toward further gains. 
</P>
<P>
"This might actually help," analyst Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
said of the moderately steep decline. He said the market had fallen back to 
prices it had skipped over on its way up and cited a theory that markets must 
fill such gaps before resuming a trend. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets Friday, futures prices for energy, grains, soybeans, 
livestock and meat were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 1.50 cents to 2.35 cents lower, with the contract for spot 
delivery at $1.2465 a pound and the more actively traded September contract at 
$1.2390. 
</P>
<P>
Spot prices had climbed as high as $1.2680 on Thursday, which represented a 
gain of more than 15% since Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The rally had been linked to indications that production problems, including 
ongoing miner strikes in Canada and Peru, were beginning to make a dent in 
copper stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Friday's decline was largely due to profit taking after the 
nearly vertical run-up. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said prospects for a settlement of the five-day-old Peruvian strike 
appeared to be improving. He said the miners must return to work to qualify for 
wage bonuses and some observers believe those bonuses are enough incentive to 
bring the strike to an end. 
</P>
<P>
But both Platt and Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal 
&amp; Co., said the market continued to look strong from a technical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat and corn futures prices retreated on confirmation of large foreign 
purchases of those grains while soybean futures closed higher following a 
private forecast for a surprisingly small crop. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc. pegged the U.S soybean crop at 1.84 
billion bushels compared to the Agriculture Department's estimate last week of 
1.91 billion, and Sparks pegged the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared 
to the USDA's projected 7.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1.5 cents to 5 cents lower, with September at $3.9225 a bushel; 
corn was unchanged to 1.25 cents lower, with September at $2.3475 a bushel; 
oats were unchanged to 1.25 cents higher, with September at $1.3825 a bushel, 
and soybeans were 4.25 cents lower to 7.75 cents higher, with August at $6.1575 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of a gasoline refinery shutdown in Venezuela boosted gasoline futures 
prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

VAN DE KAMP APPEALS TO BLOCK LUCKY-ALPHA BETA MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp on Friday formally filed an appeal 
with the U.S. Supreme Court in a last-ditch hope of blocking the merger of 
American Stores' Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains. 
</P>
<P>
As of late Friday, no decision had been issued by Supreme Court Justice Sandra 
Day O'Connor, who fields emergency appeals in cases under the jurisdiction of 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Barring intervention by the high court, a decision to allow the merger would 
rest with U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles as of Monday. Late 
Thursday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said it was lifting its order 
blocking the merger and was returning the case to the District Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Request Some Sales 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to block the merger will be abandoned unless the Supreme Court 
approves the stay without a bond, according to Andrea Sheridan Ordin, chief 
assistant attorney general. The attorney general's office has contested a 
$16.3-million bond imposed by Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
If the merger goes through, the attorney general's office said it will ask the 
court to force the company to sell some stores or limit its growth. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, both Ordin and Frank Rothman, an attorney for American Stores, had 
said it was their understanding that the merger would go through on Monday 
unless the top court got involved. 
</P>
<P>
However, after more closely scrutinizing the appeals court ruling, the two 
sides said they realized that the District Court still had to give its go-ahead 
to make things official. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday is not necessarily a magic day," noted Duane Peterson, a spokesman for 
the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, American Stores said it would ask the District Court to 
decide promptly on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The legal maneuverings continue a nearly yearlong battle begun when Van de Kamp 
decided last Sept. 1, as American Stores was preparing to unite the chains, to 
challenge the merger on antitrust grounds. He argued that California consumers 
would end up paying millions of dollars in higher food bills because of reduced 
competition. The District Court imposed a preliminary injunction blocking the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, American Stores, which paid $2.5 billion for Lucky Stores last 
year, has countered that a merger of the two chains under the Lucky banner 
would save the company as much as $75 million a year in advertising, 
distribution and other costs. It has vowed to pass along to customers as much 
as $50 million to $60 million in savings in the form of lower prices.

U.S. Cuts Untapped Petroleum Reserves: The Interior Department said it has 
lowered by 40% its estimate of untapped and undiscovered U.S. oil resources, 
reflecting in part the recent failures of promising drilling prospects in the 
West and offshore. In its first report on undiscovered U.S. oil and natural gas 
resources since 1981, the Interior Department estimated that the nation has 49 
billion barrels of crude oil outside known fields that could be discovered and 
put into production with existing technology. Eight years ago, it estimated 83 
billion barrels of undiscovered crude. One barrel equals 42 gallons.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SOME OPTIONS ON SAVING FOR COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I'd like to prepare myself now for my son's college expenses. He 
turns 5 this year, but age 18 will be here before I know it. What is the best 
way to prepare for this enormous expense? Should we start saving now and, if 
so, in what type of instrument? Or maybe we should just take out a home equity 
loan when the time comes. We could sure use some advice. -- A. R. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: With back-to-school nearly upon us, your question is a timely one. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Education Commission of the States, parents can expect to 
spend about $4,500 a year right now to send a child to a publicly supported 
college. For a private college education, the cost jumps to an average of 
$11,500 a year. And the costs are rising: 7% this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
So, say our experts, now is the time to begin taking steps to finance your 
son's college education. Your ability to save and the type of instruments best 
suited to you depend on your family income and other factors. We'll run down 
several choices, many of them outlined by Thomas Gau of the Torrance financial 
planning offices of Kavesh &amp; Gau. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Gau notes that whatever you choose, you should attempt to minimize 
the effect of the so-called kiddie tax on investment income of children under 
age 14. You will recall that under the 1986 tax revisions, only the first $500 
generated each year by a child's investments is tax free. The next $500 is 
taxed at 15%. Anything more is taxed at the highest rate paid by his parents. 
So, Gau counsels, your goal should be to generate tax-free or tax-deferred 
income until the investments can be cashed in after the child reaches age 14 
and is treated the same as any other taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the most popular methods of financing college expenses is 
through a universal life insurance policy. If properly set up -- and this is an 
all-important caveat -- these policies can generate tax-free interest that can 
be withdrawn when a child enters college. 
</P>
<P>
However, be warned: This method should only be used if the parents do, in fact, 
need a life insurance policy, and these policies should only be purchased on 
the advice of a qualified financial planner or another competent and trusted 
financial adviser. "Do not be tricked into thinking you need extra life 
insurance just to take advantage of the tax benefits of these policies," Gau 
says. "There are other ways to save for your children's education." 
</P>
<P>
Other popular savings instruments are municipal bonds. If you invest in bonds 
issued by public agencies in your own state, the interest generated by the 
bonds can be completely tax free. (This is the case in California.) Of course, 
you'll want to do your homework and consult a trusted professional before 
investing in muni bonds, whether individually or through a mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
Still other families invest their children's education funds in the stock 
market, usually through one or more mutual funds. Again, before making an 
investment, you should research various funds and evaluate how they have 
performed in the past and what fees they charge for participating in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
If you own your own business, you might want to think about putting your child 
on your payroll. His wages would be a business expense to you, and earned 
income up to $3,000 can be tax free to a child. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gau cautions you to be reasonable if you take this route. Obviously, 
an infant or toddler can't be a great value to a business, but some company 
owners have been known to use pictures of their kids on promotional brochures 
and pay the children modeling fees. Older children can be hired as janitors, 
office help or shipping clerks. The key, Gau advises, is not to pay the 
children more than what they're worth in the open market because the Internal 
Revenue Service is well aware of the potential for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the difficulty that many middle-income families have in preparing 
for college educations, Congress has established a special U.S. Savings Bond 
program. Beginning in 1990, interest earned on Series EE bonds issued after 
Dec. 31, 1989, can be free from federal taxation if they are redeemed to pay 
for college or vocational school. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are several restrictions. Bond buyers must be at least 24 years 
old and the tax break will apply only to bond proceeds used for tuition and 
required school fees -- not books or room and board. In addition, it will apply 
only to degree programs at colleges, universities and certain vocational 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the tax break can be used only by families and individuals who do not 
exceed certain income limits. For couples filing jointly, a $90,000 adjusted 
gross income is the cutoff; for individual filers, the cutoff is an annual 
adjusted gross income of $55,000. These tax breaks are available only for bonds 
purchased by the parents of the children attending college, not any other 
family members or interested outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Many states are offering residents special college financing programs. Eight 
states have approved prepaid tuition plans: Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Maine, 
Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming. However, only three states -- 
Florida, Michigan and Wyoming -- have actually put the plans into effect. Under 
these plans, parents are allowed to pay tuition at state-supported schools 
years in advance. Although admission to the schools is not guaranteed, if the 
child is accepted, the prepaid tuition is considered full payment, regardless 
of the rates then in effect. 
</P>
<P>
A similar plan is again pending in the California Legislature, although its 
fate is far from certain. For the past two years, the bill, sponsored by 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), has been approved by both legislative 
houses only to be vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian. Hayden's bill would allow 
parents to prepay tuition at state colleges and universities. If the child does 
not attend a state school, the payment, plus interest would be refunded, minus 
an administrative fee. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has twice vetoed the bill because of concerns that it could put the 
state in a future financial bind. The bill envisions that money invested in the 
tuition fund could earn 12% a year, while tuition costs at the state schools 
would rise 9%. This year, Hayden's latest version of the bill has passed the 
Assembly and is awaiting hearing in the Senate. Hayden's staff has urged 
interested parents to contact the governor to express their opinions on the 
legislation.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: WANT A HIGH RETURN? CHOOSE A HEALTHY S&amp;L

<P>
Shopping for the highest rates on certificates of deposit has become a 
different game these days, thanks to the federal government's massive bailout 
of savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, high-rate shoppers often ended up putting money in sick thrifts 
that offered higher rates to attract cash and stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
But now, putting your money into high-paying troubled thrifts could create more 
problems than it's worth. It may be better to go with strong S&amp;Ls that also 
pay high rates. 
</P>
<P>
Why? First, high rates offered by sick thrifts will be increasingly hard to 
find. That's because the Resolution Trust Corp., the newly formed government 
agency that has already taken over 262 insolvent thrifts and expects to acquire 
dozens more, says it will force these sick institutions to lower CD rates to 
cut their losses. 
</P>
<P>
And even if you get a high rate now from a sick thrift, there's no guarantee 
you'll keep it. If the feds take over insolvent thrifts and merge them with 
healthier ones, or transfer their deposits, the acquiring institutions now have 
the option of dumping old CD rates after 14 days. You will be given a choice of 
either accepting a new, lower CD rate from that institution -- possibly as low 
as their rates on passbook savings accounts -- or getting your money back 
without early withdrawal penalty to invest elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, you're running the risk that your CD -- and its high rate -- may 
mature sooner than you thought. 
</P>
<P>
This a radical change from previous federal policy, when acquiring institutions 
were required to continue paying rates on CDs that had not yet matured. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if CD rates rise in the interim, getting your money back early won't 
be so bad because you can reinvest at higher rates. In fact, average CD rates 
nationwide rose in the past week for the first time in more than four months -- 
possibly an indication that rate declines have stopped, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
But if rates fall, you could be stuck with a new CD with a crummier rate. 
</P>
<P>
"With this lower rate threat, consumers should think twice about keeping funds 
in institutions on the RTC hit list," says Robert K. Heady, editor of 100 
Highest Yields, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Avoid insolvents if you want to lock in a rate," adds Paul A. Bauer, editor of 
Jumbo Rate News, a Coral Gables, Fla., newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Why shoot craps?" he adds. "If somebody is basically insolvent, it's only a 
matter of time before they're taken over. The government is talking about 
closing most of them down within the next year." 
</P>
<P>
How do you know which institutions are likely to be taken over? 
</P>
<P>
You can get a free list of the 262 thrifts already taken over by the Resolution 
Trust Corp. by writing the agency at 550 17th St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20429. 
</P>
<P>
To check on others, request their financial data and look for such things as 
the ratio of equity capital to assets. Those above 5% are generally considered 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Several independent services study the health of savings institutions and 
provide ratings for a fee. One is Veribanc. For information about its services, 
write Box 461, Wakefield, Mass. 01880 or call (800) 44-BANKS. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo Rate News publishes lists of insolvent savings and loans. It lists 468 
institutions as troubled. For information about its lists, write Bauer 
Financial Reports, P.O. Drawer 145510, Coral Gables, Fla. 33114-5510. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, if you're a high-rate shopper, the news is not all bad. 
</P>
<P>
Any decline in CD rates resulting from government bailouts is expected to be 
limited to those states with the bulk of the sickest thrifts, such as Texas and 
Arizona, Heady says. S&amp;Ls are still expected to offer higher CD rates than 
banks, on average as much as half a point higher, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
"In markets unaffected by insolvent thrifts, the situation will remain status 
quo," Heady says. "If rates change at all, it will be because of the economic 
climate, not because of bailouts." 
</P>
<P>
Also, many healthy institutions are still paying among the highest rates in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
For example, three of the five highest yields on six-month CDs nationwide are 
offered by Southern California institutions generally considered to be in good 
financial shape, according to 100 Highest Yields. They are Western Financial 
Savings of Orange (9.41% annual effective yield), Beach Savings Bank of 
Fountain Valley (9.24%) and Guardian Savings &amp; Loan of Huntington Beach 
(9.20%). 
</P>
<P>
And finding high rates is not that difficult. Barron's, the Wall Street Journal 
and other business newspapers publish lists weekly on institutions paying the 
highest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative to help you find high rates: Call your stock broker. Most 
brokerage houses sell CDs issued by stronger banks and S&amp;Ls nationwide that 
are fully insured up to the $100,000 limit. They may not charge a commission 
either because banks often pay brokerages a fee to sell their CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Schwab &amp; Co.'s CD Rate Hot Line at (800) 543-8700, an example of a 
CD service offered by a brokerage, provides a recorded message listing rates on 
CDs offered by the discount brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Other alternatives: Money market mutual funds or Treasury bills. Nobody has 
ever lost a cent in them, and they currently are yielding more than comparable 
CDs (although if interest rates tumble, a CD taken out now may earn you more 
over several months than a money market fund). 
</P>
<P>
What if you already have deposits in an insolvent thrift? 
</P>
<P>
Stay put. There's not much you can, or should, do. Your money will continue to 
be safe as long as it's under the $100,000 limit in an institution covered by 
federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But if you take your money out now, you will incur early withdrawal penalties 
that could run as much as six months' interest for CDs with maturities greater 
than one year.

LEBOW TO RAISE STAKE IN MAI TO 51%, INVEST $30 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
MAI Basic Four Chairman Bennett S. LeBow, having failed in his recent hostile 
bid for Prime Computer, plans to raise his personal stake in MAI to 51% by 
investing $30 million in the Tustin computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes a week after MAI said it expects to report a 
"significant" third-quarter loss and is laying off 400 people, or nearly 10% of 
its work force. 
</P>
<P>
MAI officials said Friday that LeBow, a New York investor who owns 37% of MAI, 
will make a $30-million cash investment in MAI stock through Brooke Partners, a 
New York investment firm he controls. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke Partners will also convert $25 million in MAI preferred stock that it 
holds into common stock in MAI. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the best means necessary to strengthen our balance sheet 
and allow us to become the kind of force we want to in the computer market," 
said Eric L. Christensen, an MAI attorney. "We are quite pleased at this 
$30-million cash investment." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for LeBow said he was traveling Friday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In New York Stock Exchange trading, MAI's stock closed Friday at $4 a share, 
down 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, LeBow tried to sell MAI but could not find a buyer willing to pay 
his asking price. In November, MAI launched a hostile tender offer for Prime. 
MAI lost its bid for Prime when the Natick, Mass., computer maker agreed to be 
acquired by a New York venture capital firm.

Weyerhaeuser Co. said it will put four of its nursery products businesses up 
for sale as part of its efforts to divest itself of a number of subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
President John Creighton Jr. said the four businesses have aggregate sales in 
excess of $280 million a year, adding that Weyerhaeuser's nursery and garden 
supply sales increased four-fold in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the company said it would sell Weyerhaeuser Specialty Plants, which 
supplies specially dried flowers and plants to landscapers and interior 
designers.

DESPITE LOSS, BENES LOOKS GOOD TO PADRES 
</P>

<P>
Andy Benes sat in the back seat of the cab on the way to Olympic Stadium Friday 
afternoon, trying everything, anything, to keep his mind off his scheduled 
start in four hours. 
</P>
<P>
It was about a year ago at this time that he was in South Korea with the U.S. 
Olympic Team. Now, he was in another foreign country, in a city he had never 
visited, with a dominant language he didn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of embarrassing," he said. "I took four years of French, and I can't 
speak a word. About the only thing I can do is read a menu and street signs. I 
guess that's good for something, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Benes went on and talked about his excursion to South Korea. He talked about 
his family that would be awaiting the news of his game back home in Indiana. He 
talked about his adventure the other day riding the subway to Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The cab still was about five minutes from the stadium when, unable to restrain 
himself any more, he talked about the game ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to do so well," he said. "Maybe if I do well tonight, people will 
quit saying, 'Andy's not ready to be here; they brought him up to soon.' 
</P>
<P>
"Because I think I do belong here. I think I'm ready. Now I have to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, after his performance Friday night, he certainly doesn't have to convince 
Padre management he is ready for the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Padres didn't win, losing, 5-2, to the Montreal Expos. And the box 
score will reveal that Benes surrendered six hits and four runs in 6 1/3 
innings, including a home run. But even if Benes had pitched a complete-game 
shutout, making every batter look like Buddy Biancalana, the Padres could not 
have been more impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"All those guys who say we brought him up too soon," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "Shoot, show me guys who can pitch like that." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching coach Pat Dobson: "I thought he'd make progress, but I didn't think 
he'd make it like that, that good, that fast." 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Chris James: "I thought he threw the hell out of the ball. That 
guy can throw. I mean the first four innings, he was unhittable." 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there was the pitch. It doesn't matter how many pitches he 
throws the rest of his career, how many victories he obtains or how many home 
runs he allows. It will be remembered as the pitch that earned his teammates' 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
It was the start of the seventh when Spike Owen stepped to the plate. It was 
Owen who had tripled in his previous at-bat, leading the Expos to a three-run 
fifth that turned into a 4-1 lead by the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Owen, entering the game with a .235 batting average, dug his spikes in, trying 
to again get set to hammer the rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling nice and comfortable, Owen awaited the first pitch. Ouch. The ball 
nailed Owen on his right hip before he even had a chance to move. 
</P>
<P>
It was a purpose pitch, Owen knew, and he yelled at Benes, telling him that he 
wasn't going to put up with that from anyone, let alone a rookie. He stood at 
home plate for several seconds, contemplating rushing the mound as he did two 
months ago when he instigated a bench-clearing brawl against Houston. He then 
walked slowly down the first-base line, glaring at Benes and cursing him. 
</P>
<P>
Well, as home-plate umpire Bob Davidson nervously stepped in front of Owen, a 
curious scene was taking place. Benes, with all of nine days in the majors, was 
walking toward Owen. If Owen wanted to say something, Benes was moving toward 
him so he could hear a little better. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing. Owen decided he didn't have anything to say, after all. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not stupid," Dobson said. "He's not about to go after a guy, 6-5, 230, 
235 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, the kid showed right there he ain't afraid to throw inside to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The kid also showed that he can take a punch, if need be. In the second inning, 
Larry Walker hit a line-drive off Benes' right ankle. McKeon ran out. Dobson 
ran out. Trainer Dick Dent ran out. No problem. Benes threw five warm-up 
pitches, shooed them back to the dugout and resumed work. 
</P>
<P>
Benes also showed that while it might be too early for anyone to predict 
greatness this season, he's going to be fitting in quite nicely in the Padre 
rotation for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Throwing a slider for the first time in his career, after learning it just four 
days ago in New York, Benes had the Expos muttering to themselves the first 
four innings. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed just two harmless singles during that time, striking out five of the 
first 10 batters he faced. He struck out the side in the third, the Expos so 
confused that each was out on a called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the fifth that he finally showed signs he was a 21-year-old kid (22 
on Sunday) making his second big-league start. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the inning by walking his first batter of the game, Larry Walker. He 
got Nelson Santovenia to foul out to first baseman Jack Clark, but was called 
for a balk while facing Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps rattled, Benes then surrendered a line drive toward the right-field 
fence. Right fielder James jumped, but a split-second too soon, and the ball 
sailed over his head, caroming off the fence for a triple. Pascual Perez scored 
Owen on a perfectly executed squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Benes' problems continued when he surrendered a single to Dave Martinez. He 
then balked again, tying him for the club lead already, and promptly 
surrendered a single to Tom Foley to right, scoring Martinez. He got out of the 
jam by retiring No. 3 hitter Andres Galarraga, and the only other run he 
allowed was a homer to Tim Raines on a two-and-oh pitch in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just outstanding," Dobson said. "I told him I don't even want him to 
think about wins and losses. Progress, that's all I'm interested in, and 
building the foundation for next year." 
</P>
<P>
It might be difficult to understand for a pitcher who has grown up knowing only 
that an "L" next to his name meant failure, but Benes is starting to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the difference was night and day between my last outing and this 
one," Benes said. "I just felt so much more comfortable. And once I got out 
there, I treated it just like another game. 
</P>
<P>
"That slider that Pat (Dobson) taught me, I took into the game like I'd been 
using it my whole life. I got hurt on it a couple of times, but for the most 
part, I was pretty happy with the way it felt." 
</P>
<P>
Benes threw 31 off-speed pitches, 21 were for strikes. Not bad improvement 
considering that just six of his 30 off-speed pitches were strikes in his first 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to hearing about this kid for some time," Dobson said. "He's 
going to be a good one. And from what we're seeing right now, he's going to be 
real good one." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres fell to 10 games behind the division-leading San Francisco Giants 
with just 40 games remaining to be played. . . . Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn, 
who was playing with an extremely sore left Achilles tendon and was 
questionable to even play Friday, went one for three.

MCMAHON'S DIFFERENT, BUT CHARGERS ARE EAGER TO MEET HIM

He hit his seventh grade teacher, has verbally sparred with everyone including 
his head coach and the commissioner of the National Football League and led the 
Chicago Bears to a Super Bowl championship. 
</P>
<P>
And he is coming to your town. 
</P>
<P>
Few Charger players know quarterback Jim McMahon. But everybody on the team is 
familiar with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Who doesn't know much about McMahon?" Charger running back Lionel James asked. 
</P>
<P>
Said receiver Jamie Holland: "It will be a pleasure to meet him. I can't wait 
to meet the guy. And there's no better way to meet him than meeting him as my 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
And so it went Friday at UC San Diego as Coach Dan Henning sent the Chargers 
through a final walk-through before they left for Chicago to play an exhibition 
game and pick up a new quarterback. McMahon will join the Chargers this 
afternoon in Chicago and return with them late tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's a leader and a winner," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "We want a guy 
like that around. We haven't been accustomed to winning, so maybe he'll bring 
in a new line of thinking. I don't know him. I know of him, like everybody 
else. He's a winner -- that's all I need to know." 
</P>
<P>
The only Chargers who have stood on the same sideline with McMahon are 
quarterback coach Ted Tollner, who was the offensive coordinator during 
McMahon's senior season at Brigham Young in 1981, and defensive end Tyrone 
Keys, who was with the Bears from 1983 through 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Keys said the McMahon he knows is not necessarily the same one who appeared on 
the cover of Rolling Stone and was dubbed a punk rock quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the illusions people have is that he's arrogant," Keys said. "He's 
nothing like that. He's strictly a team player. The media perceived him one 
way, but the players all loved him." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that was before and during the Bears' Super Bowl Shuffle through the 
NFL in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The team changed after the Super Bowl, with everybody looking for their 
share," Keys said. "But (before), we had a real close team." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon may enjoy promoting his footloose reputation, but Keys also said he is 
a hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt," Keys said. "Look at the way he's come back from injuries. He 
works his butt off in the off-season. He's a hard-nosed player who will hang 
out with the offensive line and roll his shirt (sleeves) up. He's a throwback. 
I think it was a positive move. He's a proven winner. He's a guy who I think 
the players will rally around." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Malone won't be one of them. By late Friday afternoon, he was 
getting ready to board a plane home to Baden, Pa., to map out future plans, 
still reeling from the news that he had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but it happens," he said. "Hopefully, something will come up in the near 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran quarterback David Archer said he wasn't surprised by the McMahon 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bears have three quarterbacks playing pretty well, which made all of them 
marketable," Archer said. "The way (Jim) Harbaugh and (Mike) Tomczak played in 
the first preseason game (against Miami) allowed them to make a move." 
</P>
<P>
Archer also said he wasn't surprised to see Malone released. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, I'm not surprised by any moves," he said. "I had my best training camp 
as a pro in Miami last year and was released. You never know. Obviously, Jim 
was brought in here to try to start. Until he gets a full grip on what we're 
doing offensively, they'll be leaning toward myself and Billy Joe (Tolliver, a 
rookie)." 
</P>
<P>
Holland doesn't know McMahon, but one of his Ohio State quarterbacks, Tomczak, 
has spent the past four years with McMahon in Chicago. Holland said he talked 
with Tomczak this summer and asked him about McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"He said McMahon is a leader," Holland said. "And what what more can a 
quarterback say? I've talked to our other receivers, and their eyes were 
lighting up." 
</P>
<P>
Said James: "A lot of people dislike his demeanor. He's his own person. He says 
what's on his mind, but I think that's a good quality in a person. I'm looking 
forward to playing with the guy." 
</P>

Ulmus parvifolia 
</P>
<P>
Chinese elm 
</P>
<P>
Medium-large evergreen or deciduous tree with graceful weeping habit 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't look anything like the American elm: no upswept vase shape, no huge 
limb spread that could shade three houses at once, no stately, imposing 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Where the American elm can be a towering 100 feet in height, the Chinese elm 
won't go much beyond 60 -- but it gets there faster, often achieving 30 feet in 
just five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese elm is also an exceptionally beautiful tree: Gray-brown bark peels 
off in patches as the tree reaches maturity, resembling California sycamore or 
eucalyptus bark, and long, drooping branches of tiny, dark green, serrated 
leaflets are as graceful as a willow's. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't provide a lot of shade -- it's neither dense nor very wide -- but it 
makes a lovely dappled shadow on a stucco building and will at least shade a 
patio in the heat of the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resistant to Dutch Elm Disease 
</P>
<P>
And the tree is resistant to Dutch elm disease. Not immune -- just resistant. 
Fortunately, this miserable fungus is not a problem in Southern California 
because the spores, carried by the elm beetle, dry up before they reach their 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese elm keeps its leaves all year in Southern California's benevolent 
lowland climate, but in the colder mountains and high deserts, the leaves will 
drop after turning a handsome yellow to purple-red. There are also clusters of 
red fruits in the winter -- something to admire in every season. 
</P>
<P>
And this tree is no sissy; it can take drought, alkaline soil, severe heat and 
soil compaction, making it one fine street tree. Its branches are strong, 
unlike the American elm, whose brittle branches often end up on (or through) a 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Careful Pruning Needed 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese elm does need careful pruning, though, so it won't get rangy and 
unkempt. I was once horrified to see a row of them hacked to bits by an 
energetic tree pruner; only stumps of branches were left and I was sure the 
trees would collapse. Next year, they had sprouted new branchlets; these became 
branches, and in two years the trees looked full and healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
The most common variety of Ulmus parvifolia is "Sempervirens"; "Brea" and 
"Drake" have a more upright habit and "True Green," described as "more 
evergreen" in Monrovia Nursery's wholesale catalogue, has small, very shiny 
leaves. The trees are available in 1-gallon through 30-inch containers and 
should be easy to find or order at local nurseries; the patient pioneer might 
want to grow a few from seed. JUDITH SIMS

MORNING BRIEFING: SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FISH, YOU GET CAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did you know that Doug Rader, when he was playing third base for the Houston 
Astros, once was thrown in jail for slugging a game warden? 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Edwards, the catcher on the team, tells about it in a Sporting News 
story written by former pitcher Jim Bouton. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: "Rader was fishing in the middle of some river without a license, and 
they came after him in one of those airboats. So Rader throws his fishing stuff 
in the bushes and dives under the water. He was breathing through a reed. 
</P>
<P>
"He might have made it, but he kept hearing the boat getting closer and closer 
and he didn't want to be pulverized by the propeller." 
</P>
<P>
So he surfaced. Then came the encounter with the game warden, and it was off to 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: "He came right to training camp from jail. No shoes. Hadn't changed 
his clothes in three days." 
</P>
<P>
Add Edwards: Claiming Rader is still crazy, he said: "When he managed the Texas 
Rangers, he invited about 12 sportswriters into the locker room, took off his 
shirt and challenged them all to a fight. They all backed off." 
</P>
<P>
Add Astros: "And then there was Julio Gotay, the Astros' best Dominican utility 
player," Bouton writes. "Gotay provided the service of carrying a dead fish on 
plane trips to ward off evil spirits. Don't laugh; we never crashed. Gotay was 
also famous for having a cheese sandwich fall out of his back pocket -- while 
he was sliding into second base." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Catfish Hunter, Don Larsen and Tom Lasorda have in common? 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Bill Landrum is a son of 
former Dodger pitcher Joe Landrum, whose career was cut short by injuries 
suffered in the Korean War. Joe was an All-American at Clemson and pitched 
against George Bush when the Tigers faced Yale in the 1947 National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. playoffs. Bush went one for four, and Yale won, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
No deal: Said Philadelphia Eagles Coach Buddy Ryan, when asked about rumors 
that defensive end Reggie White would be traded to the Detroit Lions for 
unsigned running back Barry Sanders, the Heisman Trophy winner: "A running back 
comes out every year. I've only seen one guy who is 6-5, 295 pounds and runs 
the 40 in 4.6, and I'm not going to trade him." 
</P>
<P>
No picnic: How tough will it be for George Seifert to replace Bill Walsh as 
coach of the San Francisco 49ers? Linebacker Mike Walter put it this way: "I 
think Coach Walsh would even have a hard time filling his own shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Add 49ers: Seifert allowed running back Roger Craig to miss a meeting so he 
could go to Reno to watch his brother-in-law, Michael Nunn, defend his 
International Boxing Federation middleweight title against Iran Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a thing would not have happened in a Walsh camp," wrote William D. Murray 
of United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: All three pitched for the Kansas City A's. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Babe Laufenberg, journeyman quarterback, on his battle to hang on 
with the Dallas Cowboys: "I'll do anything Jimmy Johnson wants me to do. If he 
wants me to run 26 miles through the hills, I'll do it. If he wants me to carry 
the water bottles, I'll do it. If he wants me to go to his barber and get my 
hair cut like his -- well, you have to draw the line somewhere."

PLAYGROUND BALL COSTS DODGERS; METS WIN, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is one thing to be a proud World Series champion bravely losing a battle 
with slumps, injuries and inevitable mortality. 
</P>
<P>
It is another thing to be unable to play catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' problems, which grow more elementary by the day, fell somewhere 
between the eighth- and ninth-grade levels Friday when they botched a rundown 
play that led to a 3-2 loss to the New York Mets before a sellout Shea Stadium 
crowd of 46,143. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth inning, the Mets' Kevin McReynolds singled and eventually scored 
the winning run without benefit of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"We work on rundown plays every other day in spring training," Dodger infield 
coach Bill Russell said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"They are fundamental plays. They must be made." 
</P>
<P>
"You in a rundown play," shortstop Alfredo Griffin said angrily, "you out." 
</P>
<P>
Only sometimes, as the Dodgers proved Friday night. With one out and the score 
2-2, McReynolds had reached first base on a grounder behind third base that 
shortstop Griffin could only knock down. McReynolds, who had stolen 33 straight 
bases dating to 1987 before being caught in Philadelphia earlier this year, 
then stole second. 
</P>
<P>
So he's quick. But he's not quick enough to escape what happened next -- a Dave 
Magadan grounder back to pitcher Orel Hershiser that caught McReynolds between 
second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser spun and threw to Griffin on second base. Griffin waited for 
McReynolds to edge toward third, then threw to third baseman Jeff Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of running McReynolds back to second base, as written in Dodger 
manuals, Hamilton threw back to Griffin. And he threw it low. Griffin dropped 
the throw, McReynolds ran to third, and Griffin could only run back to second 
and tag an oncoming Magadan for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds didn't stay on third base long. With the count 1 and 2 to Barry 
Lyons, Hershiser threw a curveball into the dirt. It bounced away from Mike 
Scioscia, and McReynolds scored. 
</P>
<P>
"While that pitch will show up as a reason we lost the game," Hershiser said 
later, "it is not the reason. There are others." 
</P>
<P>
The blown rundown was merely the most glaring. The Dodgers blew another chance 
in the top of the ninth. After Mike Sharperson reached third base with one out 
against reliever Randy Myers, the Dodgers' leadoff and No. 2 hitters couldn't 
bring him in: Griffin struck out and Willie Randolph lined a fastball to center 
fielder Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway down the first-base line, Randolph jumped, threw up his arms, and began 
the walk back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before he crossed a line of ushers in front of the dugout, he spiked 
his helmet on the grass and left it there. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had him," Randolph said. "I got my pitch. I had a good swing. I 
thought this was it." 
</P>
<P>
"I lucked out," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
That happens to good teams. Few are better these days than the Mets. They won 
for the ninth time in 11 games. They moved within 3 1/2 games of Chicago in the 
National League East. 
</P>
<P>
It was Myers' team-leading 20th save. Met starter David Cone, who hasn't lost 
since June 5, gave up Eddie Murray's two-run homer and six other hits in 
winning his eighth straight decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, meanwhile, spent late Friday night as they have spent many late 
nights this summer -- rehashing a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be aggressive on rundowns, and Hamilton was not aggressive," 
Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
"You are taught to run the guy back to the base he came from. If Hamilton had 
done that, we'd have gotten a double play." 
</P>
<P>
"Griffin held out his glove," Hamilton said, "and that's a sign to throw it to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Russell said: "Yes, that's a signal, but the runner was not close enough (to 
Griffin) to throw it. That's common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was not immune to Russell's criticism, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfredo tried to catch the ball too quick, tried to get cute with it, grab it 
and tag the guy at the same time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said: "You can't mess up rundowns. You can't. The guy can't outrun the 
ball. I hate messing up rundowns." 
</P>
<P>
And as much as Hershiser hates throwing wild pitches, he said he would throw 
that game-losing pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I threw that same curve on the next pitch and it bounced, and Mike 
got it," said Hershiser, who gave up three runs on six hits in his eighth 
complete game but fell to 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to look at it like a pitch I'll never throw again." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to block that ball," Scioscia said. "It took a bad bounce and went 
farther than I thought. There wasn't a heckuva lot I could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
"When these things happen, you just have to keep your head in the game and go 
on with things." 
</P>
<P>
For the Dodgers, those two simple tasks are growing ever harder. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs, who left Thursday's game in Philadelphia because of a twisted 
knee, has a sprained ligament in the knee and might be put on the disabled list 
today, after being examined by Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director. Stubbs 
probably would be replaced by Mickey Hatcher, who has nearly recovered from a 
strained left hamstring and is due off the disabled list next week. . . . 
Hatcher, a potential Dodger free agent this winter, said he is seriously 
considering playing in Japan next year if he can't reach agreement with the 
Dodgers. "My wife would love to go to Japan, it would be a good learning 
experience for my children, it's something we really will look at," said 
Hatcher, who in Japan could earn substantially more than his current $450,000 
salary. "I would love to stay with the Dodgers, but when it comes to money, I 
have to look out for my family." Hatcher said his agent, Willie Sanchez, 
contacted several Japanese teams before Hatcher originally signed with the 
Dodgers in 1987. . . . Infielder Lenny Harris has been taking fly balls in the 
outfield, and could play there before the end of the season. Harris could even 
be a center-field candidate next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The official figure for Mike Scioscia's new three-year contract, according to 
league sources, is $5.55 million. Scioscia, who received an $800,000 signing 
bonus, will be paid $950,00 in 1990 and $1.9 million in both 1991 and 1992. . . 
. Dodger reliever Tim Crews met with National League President Bill White 
Friday to protest his $200 automatic fine levied for hitting Pittsburgh's Gary 
Redus July 24. The protest was denied. "He was polite, but he told me that 
because I was given a warning after hitting him, the fine was mandatory," Crews 
said. "But he also said he couldn't change the fine because Gary (Redus) 
thought I hit him intentionally. Now that's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Chris Gwynn, in triple-A Albuquerque to rehabilitate a broken right 
foot, suffered a sprained right knee in a home-plate collision Aug. 10. He will 
be out at least two weeks. . . . Pitcher John Tudor and outfielder Kal Daniels 
have rejoined the team after short absences. Tudor returned from a scheduled, 
and then postponed, shoulder examination in Boston by Red Sox physician Dr. 
Arthur Pappas. Pappas missed the exam because of illness and then a vacation. 
Jobe will examine Tudor in New York today. Daniels returned from Aug. 11 
surgery on his right knee and hopes to be back in the lineup by the final weeks 
of the season.

SOVIET REFUGEES EXPECTED TO BYPASS ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Representatives of agencies that help Soviet refugees learn English and find 
jobs said Friday that they are bracing for a dramatic increase in the number of 
new immigrants moving to the Southland in the next year as a result of the 
Soviet Union's perestroika policy. 
</P>
<P>
The projected increase in Soviet immigrants to the United States, mostly Jewish 
and Armenian -- from fewer than 800 in 1986 to as many as 150,000 from now to 
the end of 1990 -- comes as Congress considers cuts in refugee assistance 
programs in its 1989-90 fiscal budget, according to testimony Friday before a 
state legislative committee on refugee resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The strain of additional refugees is one that we welcome, something that we 
have been working toward for years," said Wayne Feinstein, vice president of 
the Jewish Federation Council in Los Angeles. "But we've had a steady flow in 
the past and we are not prepared for the gates of the Soviet Union to open as 
wide as they have." 
</P>
<P>
Of the surge of Soviet emigres, Orange County is expecting only about 100 Jews 
from the Soviet Union, said Chelle Friedman, a spokeswoman for the Jewish 
Federation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real center of Jewish population in Orange County, so many don't 
even think about coming here," Friedman said. Most new immigrants head for Los 
Angeles, she said. Still, about 100,000 Jews live in Orange County, Friedman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians leaving the Soviet Union face the same in Orange County: There is no 
central community, said John Kossakian, general manager of The Armenian 
Reporter in Glendale, where many newly arrived Armenians find a home upon 
arriving in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the immigrants have friends and relatives in Hollywood or Glendale," 
Kossakian said. He said he expects only a small number to move to Orange 
County, where there are only about 20,000 Armenians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said the Jewish Federation Council and its affiliates will spend 
about $20 million next year in public and private funds to assist Soviet 
refugees with counseling, medical care, education and job training. 
</P>
<P>
The council expects to help about 5,000 Soviet refugees next year, compared to 
1,800 this year, said Sandra King, executive director of the Los Angeles Jewish 
Family Services. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Soviet immigrants could arrive in the United States in 1990, 
said Gregory Makaron, president of the Los Angeles Assn. of Soviet Jewish 
Emigres and himself a former refusenik. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, most Soviet Armenians and about 10% of the Soviet Jews coming to 
the United States have settled in Los Angeles County, county officials said. 
Under its reform program, Moscow has taken away many restrictions against 
moving to the United States.

The Contras' top-ranking military official said Friday that the Nicaraguan 
resistance movement is not over, despite a regional peace plan signed last week 
that calls on its members to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to wait and see what the Sandinistas will contribute . . . whether 
they'll take in our interests or not," said Col. Enrique Bermudez. "But at this 
point we see nothing to induce us to demobilize." 
</P>
<P>
The Contras' military commander addressed a Capitol news conference during a 
two-day fund-raising tour that also included stops in San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudez said the peace plan signed by Central American presidents should have 
included a general amnesty. President Daniel Ortega has said the government 
would release up to 1,500 Nicaraguans who have been imprisoned for taking part 
in the Contra war or supporting the rebels. But Bermudez said there are about 
5,000 rebels detained in Sandinista jails. 
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Ortega government to reduce its military to a fifth of 
its current size. "To have 100,000 men in arms is . . . a sin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by two other Contra leaders, the military commander said the Contra 
movement is not a creation of the CIA, as some critics contend. "It's like 
saying that Solidarity was started by the United States," he said, referring to 
Poland's labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudez said he could not predict how long the Contras would be able to battle 
the Communist-supported Sandinistas without U.S. military and political aide. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tangible elements like supplies," he said, "but there are intangible 
elements also, like the will to continue." He said the will of the Nicaraguan 
resistance is "firm and strong." 
</P>
<P>
"We have very good friends in the United States, and we are confident they'll 
continue to support us," he said 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ortega and four other Central American presidents signed an 
agreement calling for the dismantling of the rebel camps in Honduras and the 
voluntary repatriation or relocation of the 6,000 to 10,000 rebels who remain 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopes Contreras has said that if the Contras 
do not agree to lay down their arms and leave his country by early December, as 
called for in the peace plan, "coercive methods" will have to be used to force 
them out. The Contras don't want to demobilize until after next February's 
elections.

TEAM AIMS TO SHATTER TRANSCONTINENTAL RECORD IN HIGH-TECH BIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four buddies will set out today from Orange County on a quick cross-country 
jaunt -- with plans to arrive in New York in, oh, say, a bit more than four 
days. 
</P>
<P>
On a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
The foursome will leave the Orange County Fairgrounds at noon in hopes of 
beating three other teams participating in the inaugural event for 
ultra-sophisticated, two-wheeled vehicles in the Race Across America. 
</P>
<P>
The four Olympic-caliber cyclists will ride around the clock by taking turns 
behind the handlebars while their counterparts rest in a support van. They hope 
not only to win the race but also to set the world record for the fastest 
crossing of the United States on a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the contraption they will ride is no ordinary 12-speed. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Gold Rush America, the 45-pound cycle looks every bit as sophisticated 
as a Stealth bomber. Wrapped in an aerodynamic sheath of bright-gold Kevlar, it 
is capable of speeds over 55 m.p.h. and features a two-way cockpit radio, a 
zip-on windshield and 56 gears. 
</P>
<P>
The bike is designed so the riders sit upright with their legs cranking a set 
of pedals mounted toward the front of the sleek craft on a 
chromium-molybdenum-steel alloy frame. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted with turn signals, taillights and a halogen headlight, the cycle is a 
street-legal version of Gold Rush, a high-speed bicycle that team member Fred 
Markham rode in 1986 to a land speed record of more than 65 m.p.h. The 
record-setting bike now sits proudly in retirement at the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
"This new bike won't have the top speed of the Gold Rush, but it's built for a 
different purpose," said Markham, a former U.S. Olympian known as "Fast 
Freddie" even before he set the 1986 record. "It's heavier, a little less 
streamlined, but a lot more practical and tough." 
</P>
<P>
The $20,000 bike was designed and built by Gardner Martin, a self-schooled 
engineer who manufactures unique bicycles in a small shop in Freedom, a tiny 
</P>
<P>
berg on Monterey Bay in Northern California. Since the mid-'70s, Martin has 
been pioneering the production of so-called "supine recumbent" bicycles, which 
feature the stretched-out setup incorporated in creations like Gold Rush 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Martin doesn't mince words when describing why he and the cyclists took on the 
challenge of crossing a continent under pedal power. 
</P>
<P>
"To go where no man has gone before! To risk the impossible!" Martin roared 
only half in jest as the group gathered at a Seal Beach bike shop Friday to 
prepare for the journey. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain kind of person who enjoys being on the cutting edge. For me, 
this is the cutting edge of engineering. For the riders, it's the cutting edge 
of performance and danger." 
</P>
<P>
Riding the high-tech cycle is a bit different than a spin down to the corner 
market on your Schwinn. With its wind-slicing profile and light curb-weight, 
the machine can buck from side to side in crosswinds or head downhill at speeds 
nearing 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more scary than an E-ticket ride at Disneyland," said team rider 
Greg Miller, the bike shop owner and a former Olympic team member. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows better than Fast Freddie. A few years back, he was pedaling the 
bike's predecessor through a high-speed time trial when a gust of wind swooped 
down and sent the cycle sliding down the highway at 60 m.p.h. When Markham came 
to rest 300 feet away, he was shaken, but escaped without serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I've fallen over at a stoplight and been hurt worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like his colleagues, Markham sees the event as a hefty test of his endurance 
skills and a psychological challenge. Designer Martin sees a more practical 
outgrowth of it all. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes such technological displays will help push society to accept a 
replacement for automobiles, envisioning a day when streamlined, solar-powered 
cars -- the "natural offshoot," he contends, of Gold Rush America -- will flood 
the streets of America. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, a race must be won. 
</P>
<P>
Long a test of human endurance for riders of traditional bicycles, Race Across 
America for the first time features a category this year for "human-powered 
vehicles" like Gold Rush America. 
</P>
<P>
Among the competitors is Lightning, a 31-pound cycle piloted by a team led by 
Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook. A two-time Race Across America winner, Penseyres 
holds the record for crossing the United States, completing the trip in 8 days, 
9 hours and 47 minutes in 1986. Markham and his teammates figure Lightning will 
be their principal competition. 
</P>
<P>
Although no prize money awaits the winner, the competition promises to be keen. 
Markham predicts that Gold Rush America is at least 7 m.p.h. faster than 
Lightning, and nearly twice as fast as the other two entrants. Nonetheless, 
Lightning is likely to perform better in winds and up steep grades, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a bit like the tortoise and the hare," Markham said. "Lightning will 
probably be steady and slow, but consistent." 
</P>
<P>
But crossing the country will take more than just a good bike. The foursome -- 
Markham, Miller, Michael Shermer and Daniel Tout -- have been training in 
recent weeks to adjust to the unusual 
</P>
<P>
characteristics of their machine. Spending up to six hours a day on the road, 
the group's principal training has come on other bikes manufactured by Martin. 
</P>
<P>
The team has had precious few hours on Gold Rush America other than a test-run 
last week from San Francisco to Los Angeles, which was completed in a swift 16 
hours even though three hours of the trip were spent on mechanical repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dearth of hands-on experience with the race bike, the cyclists 
seemed confident that the cross-country trip can be made without serious 
mishap. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in it a bit and been buffeted around, but I adapted pretty quickly," 
said Tout, a top Canadian cyclist and skier. "Of course, now that I've said 
that, I'll probably end up in a ditch someplace." 
</P>
<P>
The group members expect to spend an hour each cycling during the race, then 
trade off, getting about three hours' rest before getting behind the handlebars 
again. With the trip expected to take about 100 hours, the team members 
probably will swap places at the controls 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
For each one, a major worry is that the cramped cockpit, which was designed for 
aerodynamic speed and not rider comfort, will lead to such stifling heat that 
they will wish an on-board air conditioner had been installed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot like taking a stationary bike into the bathroom, turning on the 
heat lamp and riding," Markham said. "You're instantly hot." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Shermer predicts the group will win -- and wallop the 
transcontinental record. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dream goal is under four days," said Shermer, a sports psychologist and 
holder of several bicycle endurance records. "But four days and six hours might 
be a bit more realistic. . . . We're going to be thrashed to the max."

4 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO ARMS-SALE COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Irvine businessman and three others pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of 
conspiracy and attempting to illegally export weapons, allegedly to what they 
thought was a Mexican drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. citizens and two Mexican nationals made their pleas during an 
arraignment before Magistrate Barry Moskowitz in U.S. District Court in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The four were indicted last week by a federal grand jury after officials seized 
97 Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles Aug. 8 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The four people named in the indictment are Jose Luis Rodriguez, 27, a 
naturalized U.S. citizen living in San Diego; Adam Danile Hahn, 25, of Irvine; 
Mario Lopez-Gutierrez, a resident alien living in Chula Vista, and Enrique 
Gobea-Rabago, 25, an illegal alien living in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn is the only one currently free on $150,000 property bond, but Assistant 
U.S. Atty. David L. Katz said he expects Rodriguez to be released this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The four will appear again in federal court Sept. 5, when a judge will set a 
trial date. 
</P>
<P>
The two-count indictment alleges that the semiautomatic rifles were legally 
purchased before passage of the federally mandated restrictions on assault 
rifles, and that Hahn, part owner of Guns 'N' Stuff in Orange County, agreed to 
sell the unregistered weapons to his co-defendants, who allegedly thought they 
were going to sell the guns to Mexico-based drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents had arranged to purchase the rifles from Lopez and Rodriguez for 
$700 each. Also involved in the deal were 8,000 rounds of ammunition, according 
to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of both counts, each defendant would face 15 years in federal 
prison and a $500,000 fine.

<P>
MAN GIVEN 26 YEARS TO LIFE IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Westminster man was ordered Friday to spend 26 years to life in prison for a 
fatal shooting in a Vietnamese restaurant last year that apparently started 
when a customer looked at the man and his friends the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ragnar R. Engerbretsen sentenced An Van Dao, 21, in Superior Court in 
Newport Beach after a jury convicted him in June on charges of second-degree 
murder, attempted murder, and use of a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Also convicted on those charges in the shooting were Binh Nguyen, 20, and Tinh 
Nguyen, 21. But their sentencings were postponed Friday until Sept. 22 at the 
request of their lawyers, who are seeking new trials for each of them. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the trouble began when the men became annoyed that a woman in the 
Tu Hai Restaurant in Garden Grove was staring at them. After an exchange of 
words, they followed the woman's party into the parking lot and started 
shooting at the patrons after they entered their car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the attack was Khang Duy Nguyen, 24, of Westminster. Anthony Nguyen, 
28, of Fullerton was wounded. None of the victims or the defendants were 
related, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooters fled the scene, but two of the three defendants were arrested the 
next night after they were involved in a fistfight and a shooting at another 
restaurant.

FOUNDATION OPENS $100,000 FUND DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senior Resources Foundation next week will begin a yearlong effort to raise 
$100,000 to benefit senior citizen programs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
James Straw, co-chairman of the foundation, and Peggy Weatherspoon, director of 
the Area Agency on Aging, will begin the effort Monday with 7,000 letters 
addressed to individuals throughout the county asking them to participate in 
the fund drive. 
</P>
<P>
Straw said the project is important because programs for senior citizens have 
not received an increase in government funding in 10 years.

CHILD TO HAVE LASER SURGERY AT UCI TO ERASE BIRTHMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 2-year-old girl from Ecuador will undergo an hourlong laser treatment to 
remove a disfiguring birthmark from her face at UC Irvine next week, and the 
brief surgery is likely to change her life, a relative said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For Daniela Maldonado, who will undergo treatment at UCI's Beckman Laser 
Institute on Tuesday, the state-of-the-art procedure "is pretty much a 
miracle," said the girl's aunt, Joy Maldonado of La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
"If the mark is not removed, life will be hard for Daniela when she goes to 
school," Maldonado said. "Children can be cruel, but parents can be more cruel. 
They believe the birthmark is a disease and they keep their children away." 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado and her husband, Romulo, learned of the treatment shortly after 
Daniela was born and have been saving money for the surgery and transportation 
costs ever since. Officials at the Beckman Institute, one of only a few clinics 
in the country that performs the delicate procedure on children, have not yet 
determined the cost of Daniela's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, which is performed under general anesthetic at a cost of $2,100 
an hour, may be performed at a lower cost for Daniela because her family has 
traveled so far, according to Dr. Michael Berns, director of the institute and 
a professor of surgery at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Daniela arrived from Ecuador with her mother, Elvira, earlier this week. 
Because visa approval was delayed, her father, Eugenio, is not expected to 
arrive until Tuesday, shortly after the planned treatment by Dr. Adrianna 
Schreibner, associate clinical professor of surgery at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure involves the use of two or more lasers to trace and seal off 
blood vessels which cause the birthmark just under the surface of the skin, 
said Schreibner, who was reached Friday in Vancouver, Canada. The pinpoint 
focus of the surgery, which takes four times longer than treatment with a 
wide-beam laser, greatly reduces scarring and skin discoloration. 
</P>
<P>
"The procedure is more difficult on children because they are growing and the 
skin is finer" than in adults, Schreibner said. "But it is also easier because 
the blood vessels are also smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Schreibner said she prefers to treat children before they begin school because 
"once they are subjected to comments by peers, that is when the real trauma 
starts. It is only a collection of vessels, and only discoloration on the skin. 
But because it is on the face and because they have to face the world every 
day, it is truly a disfigurement." 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old does not yet seem to be aware of the deep red stain that extends 
from her left ear to her chin and down to her chest, Maldonado said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been told there is an 80% chance of improvement," the aunt said. 
"Those are very good odds. If there is even a slight improvement, it would be 
very good." 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado, whose husband is the brother of Daniela's father, said that no 
comparable treatment is available in Ecuador, where the middle-class family 
lives in the mountain city of Cuenca and owns a retail hardware business.

BALLET SHOWCASE FOR GLASNOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Caught hurrying between rehearsals at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
on Friday, Soviet dancers from the Kirov Ballet marveled at the difference a 
couple of years of superpower relations can make. 
</P>
<P>
"You can really feel the glasnost," said Vitaly Svidkov, a principal with the 
company that performed in Los Angeles two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have to be in by a certain time and to report what we were doing 
each night. Now we come and go as we please, and nobody says much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
"It's so beautiful here, I don't want to work," said Veronica Ivanov, a 
22-year-old Kirov dancer who is making her first visit to the United States. "I 
just want to sit by the pool and relax."

<P>
month American tour, which concludes at the Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa, has been the most relaxed visit by a Soviet group in years, tour 
organizers and dancers said. Their performance opened Friday and continues 
through Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
While many visits have been plagued by defections, sign-carrying protesters and 
bomb threats, this year's tour of Washington, New York, San Francisco and 
Orange County has been a showcase of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities who once tightly controlled dancers have let many problems pass, 
said tour production manager Phillip Jordan, an American working with the 
Kirov. 
</P>
<P>
One dancer, who secretly married an Australian in New York, received only a 
suspension from dancing, Jordan said. In 
</P>
<P>
pre-glasnost years, such an act would probably have been viewed as an attempt 
to defect and would carry serious consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Another troupe member disappeared without notice to visit a friend in Houston 
for several days. Company managers virtually ignored it, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
"In earlier years this kind of thing would have caused a big stir and made 
everybody angry," Jordan said. "But now they're just sort of treating it like a 
vacation and everything is working beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
There was one hitch of the pre-glasnost variety. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities prohibited a laser that had ben used in Leningrad 
performances of the ballet "Le Corsaire" from being transported to the West, 
saying they wanted to keep tight reins on valuable technology. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers acted fast, Jordan said, grafting lenses from the Soviet machine 
onto an American laser apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to do everything in a terrible hurry because the FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration) has to approve all lasers used in public," Jordan said. "But 
they pushed it through for us, and we had it in time for the first 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
The machine was unveiled before the opening performance of "Le Corsaire" in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Though the tour has won raves, dancers say they will be happy to return to 
Leningrad after three grueling months on the road, glasnost or no glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we're heading home soon because it's been a very long tour," Ivanov 
said.

FIREFIGHTERS FREE HIM AFTER COLLISION; 
</P>
<P>
DRIVER TRAPPED BY LOAD OF METAL SAVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A piece of metal weighing two tons crashed through the back of a pickup truck 
and into the cab in a three-vehicle collision Friday, trapping the driver for 
more than an hour before firefighters could free him, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Chavez, 23, of Santa Ana suffered serious injuries in the midday 
collision at Raitt Street and MacArthur Boulevard after the impact of the crash 
lodged the metal in Chavez's back and jammed the truck's doors shut. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists tried to help, but the piece of prefabricated metal, which was 
apparently unsecured, was too heavy to move, witnesses said. "I tried to pull 
the door open, but it was stuck," said Frank Beverly, who stood by watching 
rescue workers try to free the man. "You couldn't move it." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons helicoptered to the scene, prepared for an on-the-spot operation if 
firefighters had been unable to free Chavez. But he was taken from the wreckage 
at 1:10 p.m. after firefighters used a pneumatic jack and a tow truck to pry 
the metal off the victim and open the pickup's doors. Chavez was put aboard a 
Lifeline helicopter that landed on the field of Greenville Fundamental School 
next to the intersection and flown to United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, 
where he was reported in serious condition Friday night with a possible broken 
back and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the pickup collided with a car trying to turn north onto Raitt as 
Chavez drove west on MacArthur. Chavez, who was alone in the blue-and-white 
Chevrolet pickup, hit the turning car along with another westbound vehicle, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the car that tried to turn onto Raitt from MacArthur was driving 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Lt. Earl Porter said the driver of that car, an 83-year-old 
woman whom he did not identify, and the driver of the other car were not 
injured. Porter added that no charges were filed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic light at the intersection of MacArthur and Raitt does not have a 
left-turn signal. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it takes something like this to get" a turn signal, said nearby 
resident Gloria Vasquez as she watched the rescue efforts. "All I saw was that 
thing," she said, pointing to the wreckage. "It's awful."

KIDS BENEFIT FROM MAGIC MOMENTS

This Day in Sports, Aug. 18, 1989: The Orlando Magic outscored the World 
Champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
The Orlando Magic shut out the World Champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is possible only in a rare clime. Say, perhaps, the Byron 
Scott Challenge for Children all-star game Friday at UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
No Pistons were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Can't trust the U.S. Mail to deliver an engraved invitation these days, Byron? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer previously engaged? We understand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing personal," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pistons have two or three guys I'd like to have play -- Rick Mahorn and 
Vinnie Johnson are two -- but they were involved with camps," Scott said, still 
considering Mahorn a Piston even though Minneapolis claimed him in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, a good enough time was had by the sellout crowd of 4,800 -- despite 
the conspicuous absences. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic -- Orlando's, not LA's -- scored 58 points Friday, 30 by Reggie Theus 
(until recently a Sacramento King), and 28 by Sidney Green (formerly a New York 
Knick). 
</P>
<P>
They were opponents for the last time for some time Friday, Green playing for 
Scott's White team, which defeated Theus' and Michael Cooper's Red team, 
153-144. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Levingston of the Atlanta Hawks led all scorers with 36 points, playing 
for the White. Scott had three and Cooper had 17. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of the Magic has not fully set in, with the public or with the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic," Green said to the officials' table when he passed by after scoring in 
the first half. "Orlando Magic." 
</P>
<P>
His baskets had been credited to the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked Theus what he thought of the Magic's first showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" he responded. "Oh yeah. I get all the Mickey Mouse jokes. But I think 
it's going to be a lot of fun. The only thing that will lack at first is the 
wins, but I think we had a better draft starting out than the other expansion 
teams (Miami and Charlotte in 1988), and Charlotte won a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
There was some slapstick ballhandling along with the sharp passing. Much of the 
sharp stuff was by the Clippers' Gary Grant, whose slinky drives helped him 
score 24 points for the White. 
</P>
<P>
And there was some good judgment, such as that of Utah's Darrell Griffith when 
he stopped short of chasing the ball into a television monitor. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't the time of year for that," said Griffith, who had 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Good decision," a teammate called. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening, after all, was about children, a benefit performance for the 
Children's Hospital of Orange County, the Samaritan Medical Center of San 
Clemente and the South County Community Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
And there were plenty of children in attendance, including a strong contingent 
of NBA heirs who cavorted on the court while their fathers stretched. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fun game, and that's just what we wanted," Scott said.

SECREST REGAINS LEAD IN SIXTH DAY OF RACE ACROSS AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Secrest of Scottsdale, Ariz., regained the lead Friday in the sixth day of 
Race Across AMerica, which started in Costa Mesa and will end in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Secrest reached Greenville, Ill., which is 1,922 miles into the race, at 7:46 
p.m. (PDT). Secrest had led through the first three days. 
</P>
<P>
In second place is Paul Salon of Tiburon, Calif., who took the lead from 
Secrest on Wednesday. Solon covered 1,873 miles to reach West Alton, Mo. Bob 
Breedlove of Des Moines, Iowa, who reached O'Fallon, Mo., is third with 1,835 
miles covered. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Notorangelo of Harvard, Ill., one of two women still in the race, is 
seventh overall with 1,740 miles covered. She passed Jefferson City, Mo. Diane 
Owens is 22nd overall and covered 1,380 miles to reach Wellington, Kan.

FORMER TITAN JENKINS HOPES TO FILL NEED FOR STEELERS' DEFENSE

A.J. Jenkins, the Pittsburgh Steelers' ninth-round draft from Cal State 
Fullerton, would like to help cure the team's pass-rushing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure hope I can do something," Jenkins said. "I'm going to do the best job I 
can because I know the pass rush is a real important part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, 6-feet-2 and 237 pounds, had 12 1/2 sacks in his two seasons at 
Fullerton. As a sophomore at Merced Junior College, he had 16 sacks in one 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins registered his first National Football League sack, and the team's only 
one, with 38 seconds remaining in the Steelers' 21-14 exhibition loss to the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers desperately need Jenkins to pressure opposing quarterbacks, 
particularly with two starters, Gerald Williams and Keith Willis, hampered by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"A.J. likes to rush the quarterback," defensive line coach Joe Greene said. 
"When he's in pass coverage, he sees a lot of things that are going on. He's a 
very instinctive ballplayer. He has a lot of talent, but he's still 
inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he is going to help us, not only in the pass rush, but overall. He 
has some great pass-rushing possibilities. But it's an injustice to consider 
him the answer to our pass rush." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, a defensive end at Fullerton, has been moved to right outside 
linebacker by the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers coach Dave Brazil said the position switch was a dramatic one at 
first for Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
"He had never covered the pass in his life," Brazil said. "But he's picked 
things up and he's been doing it pretty well. He's on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins also is pleased with his progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I need to touch up some things on my down tight end position at 
outside linebacker," he said. "I got blown off the ball a little bit (against 
Washington). I'm working on that now. But for the most part, I've been happy 
with my play at outside linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers have found a way to utilize Jenkins' pass-rushing skills. He lines 
up at right defensive end in the team's nickel defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good pass rusher and has good pursuit. He has good instincts, too," 
Brazil said.

JOHNSON SAYS TRADE WON'T AFFECT HOLDOUT 
</P>

<P>
Damone Johnson said Friday night that an end to his holdout is nowhere in 
sight, despite the Rams' trade for Detroit tight end Pat Carter earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were going to do something," said Johnson, speaking publicly for 
the first time since starting his holdout. "I wish they would have done 
something to get me in here. He (Carter) probably makes more than me right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Carter was the Lions' second-round draft choice in 1988, the 32nd choice 
overall and he signed a million-dollar package with Detroit. Johnson, who had a 
career-high 42 receptions for the Rams last season, is holding out in an 
attempt to renegotiate his $200,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they don't need me now," Johnson said. "They've got this guy in there 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he finds it curious that some in the organization have been more 
critical of his holdout than the one staged by guard Tom Newberry nearly all of 
last summer. Newberry's ultimately ended in a hefty renegotiation for the Pro 
Bowl guard. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a double standard," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he doesn't know how long his holdout will last; perhaps as long as 
he can afford it. Johnson is subject to a daily fine of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough," he said. "I want to be out there, but I have to stand up for what 
I believe in."

100 FRANCHISERS WILL SELL THEMSELVES DURING 2-DAY EXPO AT DISNEYLAND HOTEL 
</P>

It's hard to think of something these days that some franchise, somewhere, 
doesn't sell. 
</P>
<P>
There are franchises that will dye your carpets, rent you a gown, or rustproof 
your car. A Vacaville outfit franchises Wooz, an amusement park in the form of 
a gigantic maze that people pay to enter so that they can find their way out. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the nation's 2,500 franchise companies will be represented today and 
Sunday at the Worlds of Franchising Expo at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
For two days, more than 100 franchise firms -- a record number for the show -- 
will be hawking business opportunities and ideas to the 8,000 to 10,000 people 
expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
For the companies -- which represent about 20% of the nation's franchise firms 
-- the expo is a chance to find potential investors and business people who 
might become franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
For the public, it's a chance to find out how to become a franchisee -- those 
entrepreneurial, small-business people who want to own their own businesses but 
who also crave the security of a bigger entity's tested and true way of making 
a business work. 
</P>
<P>
And these days, franchises are hotter than a Big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
Projections are that franchises will account for about half of all retail sales 
by the year 2000 -- up from the one-third estimated now, according to the 
International Franchise Assn., the Washington-based association that is putting 
on the expo. In fact, the association estimates that a new franchise outlet 
opens about every 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
That's a lot of sales. And the trend shows no signs of slowing, according to 
industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
Franchises are particularly popular in California -- home for 20% of all of the 
franchise companies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's where the action is," explained John Reynolds, marketing director of the 
IFA. "California is known as the land of promise, so it attracts many 
entrepreneurs who start companies here. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that many of the exhibitors at this weekend's expo are 
based in Orange County. The roster includes two private postal services -- 
A.I.M. Mail Centers of Mission Viejo and Mail Serv of Irvine; El Toro's 
Children's Orchard, which specializes in inexpensive clothing for youngsters, 
and Huntington Beach's Money Mailer, an advertising and direct-marketing 
franchise firm.

FULLERTON COLLEGE PRODUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
'TRACERS' TROUPE MAKES IT TO SCOTTISH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
When a Fullerton College acting troupe was asked to restage a campus production 
of "Tracers" at this summer's world renowned Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, 
the cast and crew said "Absolutely!" But by mid-June, they had only six weeks 
to find the thousands of dollars they needed to pay for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Determination prevailed. "Tracers," a wrenching collage of true stories from 
the Vietnam War, will take the stage in Scotland on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an awesome feeling to be here," actor Scott Crockett, 25, said on the 
phone Friday from Edinburgh, where the troupe had arrived early Thursday 
morning. Besides, he added, "I think ('Tracers') is a story that needs to be 
told so that my generation on down can appreciate the men and women who fought 
in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
The 18-member troupe -- eight actors, nine crew members and director Pamela 
Richarde, a part-time drama instructor at the college -- plan 10 performances 
at Edinburgh's 45-seat Abbotsford Hall as part of the festival's "Fringe," 
which is devoted to smaller, offbeat companies. The group will return home 
Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Edinburgh was suggested by John DiFusco, who wrote "Tracers" with a 
group of fellow Vietnam veterans 10 years ago and who, he said, went to see the 
unheralded Fullerton production "on a whim." He was so impressed that he 
endorsed it for the prestigious festival over another by a semiprofessional San 
Diego troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of people do 'Tracers,' " DiFusco said in June. "Of all the 
productions I have not been connected with, the one they did in Fullerton is 
probably my favorite. They were hot." 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising -- the anticipated tab was $28,000 -- began almost immediately. 
The actors -- Randy Strippling, Steven Spehar, Terry McNichol, Michael Mollo, 
Nicholas Boicourt Jr., Daniel Michelson, Bradly Whitfield and Crockett -- were 
able to come up with $5,000 on their own. Together, the college's Associated 
Student Body and bursar's office gave another $9,000, according to theater 
department chairman Bob Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
But hoped-for corporate contributions proved practically impossible to find. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the corporations decided the play was too controversial and that it 
wouldn't be in their best interest to support a play that deals with the 
Vietnam War experience," Crockett said. "I sent out 68 letters to large 
corporations throughout the United States, and just about every one said 
'Thanks but no thanks.' " Avco Financial Services gave $250. 
</P>
<P>
A benefit performance of "Tracers" raised $2,000, said Jensen, who had 
programmed the college production in the first place and who helped raise funds 
for the trip. The remaining $12,000 came from private donations -- including 
more from the troupe members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff and students are so proud of these young people" in the company, 
Jensen said. "We're thrilled how honestly they approached the play, how open 
they have been and ultimately how committed they all are. They had to do a lot 
to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
During rehearsals for "Tracers," a group of Vietnam veterans spent several 
weeks working with the troupe. The veterans discussed their war experiences in 
depth and put the actors through a rigorous physical regimen. A rapport 
developed and deepened. Veterans attended performances, invited other local 
veterans along, galvanized the cast before the show, helped advertise the 
benefit and attended a send-off for the troupe last Sunday, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how heartfelt the response of the veterans has been to the 
project," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton troupe expects that the production will be a hit in Edinburgh, 
actor Crockett said, despite one slight technical difficulty: The troupe signed 
up for the festival, which attracts about 5,000 performers from around the 
world, too late to be included in the printed program. That means "we'll be 
pounding the pavement to to get flyers out." 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we'll do as well as we did in the States. We had a great response 
there. People were saying, 'I didn't know that's what happened (in Vietnam).' I 
wasn't too much up on Vietnam either, prior to researching for this part. I 
just got so involved, and it became a personal goal to let the story be told 
the way it is and the way it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe will discuss its experiences in Scotland during a "Theatre Hour" at 
the Fullerton College Studio Theatre Sept. 15 at 11 a.m. Admission: free. 
Information: (714) 992-7425.

RATINGS ASIDE, PRODUCERS OF TV DOCUDRAMAS SEE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There are certainly enough crass, venal motivations at the networks to go 
around. But to hear some of the makers of TV movies talk, there are some 
loftier goals as well. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward are allowing a made-for-TV production for ABC 
of their book "The Final Days," in hopes of reminding people about the 
constitutional crisis and the personal drama behind Watergate. So maybe they'll 
make a few bucks, too. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Joe Hynes, who reaped a lovely free ticket to Los Angeles to sit in 
a hot room with a lot of TV critics, is cooperating on NBC's "Howard Beach: 
Making the Case for Murder." He hopes it will enlighten the public about the 
much-publicized case of a vicious New York racial attack. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Shannon is cooperating with the NBC movie "Drug Wars: The Kiki Camarena 
Story," based on her book, "Desperados: Latin Drug Lords, U.S. Lawmen, and the 
War America Can't Win," in hopes it will inspire the public to demand that the 
government get serious about the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
ABC is also making a movie about the Challenger disaster, Rock Hudson's battle 
against AIDS, a Florida child molestation case and the so-called "preppy 
murder," a New York sex-and-death case that made headlines for months. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question these ripped-from-the-news stories make it a lot easier 
for television programmers to go out and market a film. The audience has heard 
about them," said Allen Sabinson, ABC's vice president for motion pictures for 
television and miniseries. "And there's no question we have some predilection 
to do them and do a lot of them. The question that we're sitting and asking is, 
is there a reason to do it that goes beyond simply getting a (rating) number?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the movies are made without the permission of the real-life 
participants, but are based on material in the public domain, such as news 
accounts or trial transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
Sabinson said "Unspeakable Acts," about the molestation of tots at a Florida 
day-care center, will serve the purpose of teaching the public the warning 
signs of child abuse. "Challenger," about the space shuttle explosion, aims to 
educate audiences on the risks of technological achievement. "The Preppy 
Murder" will try to reveal the anguish of the victim's family, not just because 
of the crime, but because of the ensuing publicity. Whether the family will 
welcome even more publicity in the form of the TV movie remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Kaufman, the producer of "Howard Beach," said he hopes that the film will 
present the facts of the case accurately and let the public draw from it what 
they will. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Travanti portrays Hynes in the movie about the successful prosecution 
of a group of white youths charged with attacking a group of blacks and chasing 
one of them to his death on a highway. 
</P>
<P>
"If it saves the life, or if it saves the trauma of one single family," Hynes 
said, "it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
"Drug Wars" is a real-life tale produced by Michael Mann, whose "Miami Vice" 
was a stylized, fictional homage to drug-fighting cops. Shannon, a journalist 
whose investigative book is an angry account of America's anti-drug policies 
and their effect on the agents in the field, said she was impressed by the 
authenticity of the movie, directed by Brian Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
"There are anecdotes that are compressed in time. You have to do that in order 
to get it intelligible for television, but I am very satisfied that the spirit 
of the story is there, and it's real," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said the movie will not depict the torture and murder of Camarena, a 
Guadalajara-based Drug Enforcement Administration agent killed by traffickers. 
"I would never put that scene in," he said. "It would be too strong. It's not 
to the point. What is to the point is the people's reactions to the fact of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein attended a news conference with the makers of the three-hour "Final 
Days." He said he would have preferred that the book be made into the stage 
play, but praised the TV movie, in which Lane Smith plays Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel strongly, you know, that we need to know about what happened in this 
epoch of our history, and what this President did," Bernstein said. "A lot of 
people in this country don't know about it, or they've forgotten about it."

WORRIED SICK;

DOCTORS CAN'T EASE PAIN HYPOCHONDRIACS FEEL

When Dr. Rudolph Hoehn-Saric was in medical school, he had a professor who was 
a certifiable hypochondriac. 
</P>
<P>
"He was constantly going for test after test, complaining about his health 
problems," recalls Hoehn-Saric, director of John Hopkins Hospital's anxiety 
disorder clinic here. "But then, he developed phlebitis in the leg and was too 
frightened to get anything done about it, got an embolism and died. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is, some hypochondriacs will worry about their health, go 
through all these tests, but underneath it all maybe they really know there's 
nothing wrong," he adds. "But if they're really sick, then they're too scared 
about it to go to the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the nature of hypochondria, or outsized fears about one's health that 
can't be eased for all the medical tests and doctor's visits in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is a disorder that can seem almost laughable -- think of Felix, the neat, 
neurotic one in "The Odd Couple" -- or annoying or ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have it. 
</P>
<P>
"They do have definite pain," says Dr. Mark Ehrenreich, a psychiatrist at the 
University of Maryland Hospital here, "no matter where it comes from." 
</P>
<P>
Even though most people know someone they would tag as a hypochondriac, not 
much is known about this psychological disorder -- what causes it, how many 
people suffer from it, how best to treat it, whether it even can be treated 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Hypochondria, known as hypochondriasis in medical terminology, is generally 
defined as abnormal preoccupation with one's health and a fear of having or 
getting a disease despite physical evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
"As with a lot of psychiatric illnesses, there's a continuum of what's normal 
and what's abnormal," says Ehrenreich, assistant director of the hospital's 
psychiatric consulting liaison service. "Some hypochondriasis is normal. 
Someone just might have had a heart attack and will be worried about his 
condition. But when it interferes with your functioning, when despite receiving 
all the tests that are negative, they persist in thinking something is wrong 
with them, and an inordinate amount of time spent on medical care, then it 
becomes more severe." 
</P>
<P>
Hypochondria can be more than the bothersome, but essentially harmless, way 
that your old Uncle Joe goes on and on about his ailments, real or imagined. 
Often, hypochondria masks a more serious problem, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
"These patients lack the language to describe other feelings or psychological 
problems, so they make physical complaints instead," Ehrenreich says. 
</P>
<P>
There are people who appear to be afflicted with hypochondriasis, but have 
something else, like depression, that they can only express in somatic signs, 
he adds. They may not be willing to accept depression as the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you see particularly in elderly patients," agrees Dr. Mark 
Teitelbaum, who heads the psychiatric consultation liaison service at Johns 
Hopkins Hospital. "And sometimes it may be part of an anxiety disorder. They'll 
have an anxiety attack, their hearts will race and they'll go to cardiologists 
thinking they're having a heart attack. It's a symptom of another psychiatric 
disorder that needs to be diagnosed." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, however, is that hypochondriacs want to believe their ailment is 
physical rather than emotional. That is the nature of the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the hypochondriasis patients resist psychological care," says Dr. 
Teitelbaum. "Instead, they will 'doctor shop,' and have multiple medical 
workups." 
</P>
<P>
And, ironically, that is perhaps the worst thing a hypochondriac can do. 
</P>
<P>
"What they should do is establish a relationship with one doctor, and schedule 
regular visits," Ehrenreich says. "Then you get to know the patient, and know 
when a new complaint arises. You talk about what's going on in a patient's 
life, for example, if there's a problem with his marriage, maybe that's why 
he's complaining about stomach problems. With regularly scheduled visits, 
you're providing for his dependency needs and recognizing the stresses in his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
That, Ehrenreich admits, is an ideal solution that often doesn't happen in real 
life. Hypochondriacs turn up frequently in emergency rooms, and the doctor on 
duty often won't know the patients' backgrounds, spending time examining them 
and ordering tests for what ultimately turns out to be a baseless complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably daily we see this, in one form or the other," says Dr. Brian Browne, 
clinical director of emergency medicine at University of Maryland Hospital. 
"Worst of all, particularly in emergency rooms, you see so many peculiar 
people, it's hard to tell, is this patient peculiar or does he really have a 
problem?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, just because you're a hypochondriac doesn't mean there's nothing 
physically wrong with you sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Even hypochondriacs actually get sick," Browne says. "It's like someone who 
predicts every day it's going to rain. Eventually, it does rain. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how many times they've been in and out, you have to deal with this 
particular episode," he added. "It takes time. Even if he has a well-documented 
medical record of hypochondriasis, what about today?" 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure just how many hypochondriacs there are out there. Researchers 
believe that hypochondria is equally common among men and women, and studies 
show from 3% to 14% of patients seen in a medical practice might be 
hypochondriacs. It is not clear, however, if that is the same percentage found 
in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Today's heightened interest in health and fitness may be a modern-day twist of 
this age-old disorder, some believe. 
</P>
<P>
People read about chronic fatigue syndrome or Lyme disease or whatever the 
current malady of the week is, and think, "Hmmm, maybe that is what's wrong 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Some believe the proliferation of health information through television and 
magazines has extended what is known as "medical school syndrome" -- in which 
students become convinced, usually temporarily, that they have whatever ailment 
they are reading about -- to the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some hypochondriacs who will get particularly concerned about 
certain diseases -- in the past, it was tuberculosis or syphilis," Hoehn-Saric 
says. "Today, it's AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
While infectious diseases indeed are something everyone should worry about, 
hypochondriacs will take that natural concern to an extreme, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes hypochondria when the concern is out of proportion, when you can't 
correct it with information," he says. "People who are hypochondriacs, you 
can't reassure them with information. Or if you can, it's only for a short 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Treating hypochondria can be difficult. There is no "cure." If the disorder is 
related to another one, treating that may cause the hypochondria to ease up. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is something else present, like depression or anxiety, you would 
treat that," Hoehn-Saric says. "You could use psychotherapy, explore some of 
the thinking patterns, find out whether their family was extremely 
health-conscious and they remember being taken to the doctor a lot as a child." 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence that people who grew up in households in which a family 
member suffered from a major disease or in which health was a preoccupation may 
be predisposed to becoming hypochondriacs. 
</P>
<P>
And one researcher, Dr. Arthur Barsky, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist 
who wrote the book "Worried Sick," has found that hypochondriacs may be more 
sensitive than others to sensations such as pain, temperature, noise and 
hunger. That may cause them to overreact to symptoms that other people would 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Hypochondriacs are different from people who have Munchausen's syndrome, in 
which patients actually make themselves sick or make themselves appear to be 
sick, and then try to get themselves admitted to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's related, in a sense, but the ordinary hypochondriac actually believes 
he's sick. The Munchausen's (patient) consciously feigns being sick," 
Teitelbaum says. "He might put a tourniquet on his leg and then go to the 
doctor's complaining of a swollen leg. Or he might ingest a lot of amphetamines 
to make his blood pressure go up." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between someone who's a hypochondriac and someone who's 
faking," Browne says. "With real hypochondriacs, they're not out to 
deliberately fake you out. They're really suffering from these things -- these 
headaches, these stomach problems."

MASTER MINIATURIST JUST KEEPS THINKING SMALLER AND SMALLER

David Edwards is a successful professional cellist. He has, however, virtually 
given up playing. He does recording work; he plays for pleasure. But he spends 
his days making rolling-pins and mustard pots, hairbrushes, egg cups (complete 
with egg and spoon), pepper mills and spools of thread (in 25 colors). 
</P>
<P>
Small, ordinary household items. Only Edwards' objects are far from ordinary -- 
though small they certainly are. Very small. They are miniatures: minuscule 
replicas, one-twelfth normal size. 
</P>
<P>
And they are not just run-of-the-mill miniatures. Beautifully designed, with a 
"timeless" Victorian-cum-Edwardian flavor, their quality is unbelievably 
exacting: They are "absolutely right to the nth degree" said Robert Clark, then 
director of Glasgow's Scottish Design Center, when he exhibited them in 1982. 
They are made in fine and appropriate materials -- various woods like box, 
plum, holly, pear (all selected and seasoned at home by Edwards), as well as 
silver, gold, silk, stainless steel, brass, ivory. (The ivory is recycled 
scrap: old hairbrush or knife handles.) 
</P>
<P>
David Kilpatrick, Europe's leading miniature collector whose museum at Oban, 
Scotland, is attracting thousands of visitors, unhesitatingly rates Edwards' 
work "A-1." "I know of nobody better -- put it that way," Kilpatrick says. 
"There are literally thousands of miniaturists . . . but I don't think he can 
be bettered." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards chuckles: "A lot of people thought I was bonkers when I started doing 
this full time. Sometimes, I think I am absolutely mad!" 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards is probably saner than the rest of us: His new career, in a field 
that has greatly expanded this decade (little things having become big 
business), is a marked success, both in personal satisfaction and financial 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand-born Edwards broke away from his career as a cellist six years ago. 
"There was no problem. I had plenty of work," he says. He had played with 
top-class chamber and symphony orchestras and was most recently co-principal 
cellist with the Scottish National Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
He says he is not sorry to be free of continual traveling. Now he goes to work 
by climbing the steep stairs to the attic of his sizable Victorian house where 
he lives with his wife and two daughters. Here, two former bedrooms -- not 
overly large -- act as office, dispatch depot and workshop. 
</P>
<P>
When he was still a full-time musician, the spare time he used to have in 
strange cities was not wasted. His early interest in making model ships was 
already developing into the challenging occupation of amateur miniature-making, 
starting with miniature kitchen chairs and tables. So when he was playing in 
Chicago, he naturally grasped every possible moment to study the remarkable 
miniature Thorne Rooms at the Art Institute, with their astounding period 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
And it was when he was playing in Liverpool, England, in the '70s, that he 
bought his superb "Unimat SL" lathe. ("A turning point in my career.") With 
this tool (he had never used a lathe before), and chisels kept incredibly 
sharp, he found he had an extraordinary ability to make turned wood and ivory 
things smaller than anybody had ever attempted. "When you don't know it's 
impossible, you find ways of doing it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He can't conceive of employing someone else: They simply couldn't meet his 
standards. His is a one-man craft, a one-man business. He sells to the trade 
only, restricting the shops he supplies to about 15 worldwide, with Britain, 
America, and Japan heading the list. He has a range of more than 60 items, 
introducing a new one every three months in time for the only advertisement he 
places in a miniaturists' magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to concentrate," he says of his work. "If you don't, something goes 
wrong." He is, after all, often working to the very limits of his materials, 
measuring his accuracy by the test that "if you magnify it 12 times, you could 
use it." 
</P>
<P>
His toothbrush for example, though it is a mere 15 millimeters long, has real 
bristles just like a full-size one. But not only that. The bristles are in 
tufts. It took him at least two years of thinking and experimenting to work 
that out. They feel right, too. "If you don't get it right," he says, "it 
sticks out like a sore thumb, even that size." It's the same with his clothes 
brushes and hairbrushes. He makes a hairbrush for "Gentlemen," one for 
"Ladies," and as if those weren't small enough, he makes one for "Babies." He 
feels strongly that a miniature must reflect light in the right way. Sometimes 
the material or finish used for full-size objects would be quite wrong for a 
miniature. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his objects are recognizable enough -- thimbles, corkscrews, pepper 
mills, potato peelers, wooden spoons. Other objects are not so often 
encountered: the lemon squeezer (boxwood), the Scottish oatmeal roller, the 
darning mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more obscure objects -- things you might find in museums of 
Victoriana -- are a baby's teething ring, in ivory, with a fine silver handle. 
Strangely, this item is particularly popular in Japan. He makes buttonhooks 
(irresistible to collectors of full-size buttonhooks), and, according to one of 
his customers -- Jacqueline Farnsworth of Oakland, Calif. -- his holly-wood egg 
rack for 12 ivory eggs is particularly British. 
</P>
<P>
Farnsworth, who buys and sells miniatures from all over the world, can hardly 
speak highly enough of Edwards' work. "I just don't know anything to equal the 
quality of his work. No one -- in this country -- even tries. There is no 
comparison for his ivory work, for his fine turned wood." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards guards some of his secrets. Ask him how he does certain things, and he 
says "Aha!" mysteriously, and changes the subject. He won't tell anyone how he 
does the bristles, or how he saws his diminutive ivory comb so that it has two 
sizes of teeth, or how he makes his eggs. 
</P>
<P>
He is secretive not, one suspects, because he fears competition (though some 
people are now beginning to copy him), but, by his own account because he wants 
to preserve the "magic" of what he is doing. "I mean, a conjurer wouldn't tell 
you how he does his tricks, would he?" 
</P>
<P>
He generally starts with a real-life prototype, though not always, and he 
adapts it to his taste, and to be convincing as a miniature. His preliminary 
drawings are full-size -- if he drew the object at one-twelfth scale (now 
accepted as the standard scale for serious miniatures), the pencil lines would 
be too thick. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is not making his miniatures for children. They're too fine, too small 
-- and too expensive. (The toothbrush sells in the United States for $14.95, a 
spool of thread for $2.50). They are adult collectors' items. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jennings, publisher of a new magazine in Britain, "The Doll's House 
World," whose wife collects miniatures, believes that some collectors are 
principally attracted by the "antiques" aspect of the thing. "You'd have to be 
incredibly rich to be able to completely furnish a period house in the way you 
can with miniatures." 
</P>
<P>
And what makes miniature-makers tick? "Some miniaturists are very inward, very 
introspective," Kilpatrick told me, "not David: David is just David!" With him, 
it's clearly the challenge to make something minute with the utmost precision 
that counts. 
</P>
<P>
He can look at miniature-making with a cool objectivity -- for a moment or two 
-- but he's probably in the grip of a fascinating preoccupation no less than 
his collectors, some of whom have everything he has made. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see them," Edwards laughs (he's a stamp-collector himself), "they 
get completely obsessed. They'd go to any lengths to get a particular 
miniature." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "Sometimes they get it out of proportion!"

DON'T SAY 'CAN'T' TO THIS IMPRESARIO; SHE'LL SAY, 'WHY NOT?'

<P>
"One statement that makes me crazy is when someone says, 'It can't be done.' I 
would have to know, why can't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Stoessinger -- classical pianist, concert producer, lecturer and 
founder and artistic director of the Cathedral Free Concert Society at the 
Cathedral of St. John the Divine here -- believes that if it's worth doing, it 
can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Starting the concert series at St. John the Divine, for instance. Today, New 
Yorkers tend to agree that the cathedral is a great place to go for a concert, 
but when the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, Dean of the Cathedral, suggested the 
idea to Stoessinger about 10 years ago, it was a different story. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people said to me, 'Don't waste your time,' " she said. "'It's uptown. 
The neighborhood isn't so good. The acoustics are bad. It's freezing cold in 
the wintertime. Why would anyone want to go there to a concert?' " 
</P>
<P>
Stoessinger leans back into the sofa at her Upper West Side apartment, and as 
she speaks, her voice takes on a tone of gentle determination. "Well, when 
people are so negative, it's more of a challenge than ever." 
</P>
<P>
She had heard that the Viennese pianist Paul Badura-Skoda had not appeared in 
the United States for a while, and on just two weeks' notice, she was able to 
arrange for the first concert at the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on a weeknight in March," Stoessinger said. "It was cold, and it was 
pouring down rain. We had no help with publicity; there was a very small 
calendar listing in the New York Times. Badura-Skoda was staying at my house, 
and he was playing free of charge. So I felt an enormous obligation to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there at 6 o'clock at night with my heart in my throat, wondering how 
I'd live through it. By 6:30, there was a long line, and we had almost 3,000 
people that first night! We had no sound system, no help with the acoustics, 
nothing. How people knew -- it's still a mystery to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew then that if people were willing to stand in the freezing cold rain on 
a weeknight in March to go to a concert uptown, that something was right about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the ambiance of the cathedral is special. It is the largest 
cathedral in the world. That the Statue of Liberty could fit under the dome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very grand setting for music," says Stoessinger, who has watched the 
audiences grow from local to worldwide. The Cathedral's annual New Year's Eve 
Concert for Peace has become a New York tradition, featuring artists such as 
Leonard Bernstein and Frederika Von Stade, and drawing more than 6,000 people 
who will often wait in line for hours to get in. The New York Times has called 
it "New York's most magnificent free concert." 
</P>
<P>
People seem to feel comfortable at the Cathedral concerts and, unlike the 
audiences at Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, which are often white and largely 
upper-class, those at St. John the Divine are often racially and socially 
mixed. The atmosphere, although quiet, is relaxed and casual. 
</P>
<P>
Stoessinger produces more than 60 annual events at the cathedral in addition to 
being involved in a variety of other projects, among them benefit concerts for 
Amnesty International, writing articles on the arts and producing an operetta 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
Performing as a pianist is an important part of her life. She often plays in 
the programs at the cathedral, and she has been hailed by the New York Times as 
"one of the most poetic pianists of our time." 
</P>
<P>
She recently performed a new work by Lukas Foss -- "Remembering Anne Frank," 
with Foss conducting the Brooklyn Philharmonic, at a tribute on the 60th 
anniversary of the birth of the teen-ager who died in a Nazi concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Stoessinger, who holds degrees from Columbia University, Barnard College and 
the Eastman School of Music, talked about her background, an unusual one for 
someone who has become a kind of grande dame of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in the Ozark Mountains in Missouri -- it's really along way from a 
city or from any seat of culture. My parents were very hard-working people. My 
father only went through the eighth grade in school, but he always said a woman 
can never have too much education. If you want to be President of the United 
States, why not? That is the way he perceived life." 
</P>
<P>
Stoessinger remembers growing up thinking mostly of music and having a career 
from the age of 9. "I was the organist in a funeral home for a dollar a 
funeral; I played for the Rotary club -- I got out of school to do it! And I 
was the church organist and the school accompanist." 
</P>
<P>
Her talent for organization showed up early, too. She got her high school 
involved in putting on plays. In college, she produced her first concert, an 
ambitious benefit for Hungarian refugees, involving the Budapest String 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're inexperienced, you don't understand the limitations -- there 
aren't any," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone for an assessment of Stoessinger, Lukas Foss said: "I don't 
know how she does it, but she always gets everybody to come to the concerts, 
and she gets a lot of very good people to give their services. Every event is 
'gala.' Sometimes she does it at the last moment, and it always works. She's 
full of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Folk singer Odetta, who has performed at the cathedral, says working with 
Stoessinger has been encouraging. "She may be of a fading breed that are 
curious and daring -- with taste," Odetta said. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing her recipe for success, Stoessinger begins by describing what it 
isn't: "It's not the bureaucratic approach of, 'Here's our $50,000. We'll have 
a program on June 1. This fits into this slot. This is so-and-so's job' and you 
hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real care or passion in that. The arts are too important not to be 
passionate about them. We're not selling shoes." 
</P>
<P>
As far as problems with fund-raising are concerned, Stoessinger takes a 
positive approach. "In the arts we have to find ways to use support to make the 
arts lively and healthy in this country. We just have to work harder and be 
more creative in finding ways to use the resources we have."

'REAL' MEN WILL AVOID THIS BOOK; 
</P>
<P>
WHY, EVEN TODAY, MOST WOMEN WORK A 'SECOND SHIFT' 
</P>

<P>
Real men used to refuse quiche. Today, when it is served up by wives in 
business suits who have rushed home from the office, briefcase in one hand, 
children and a store-prepared meal in the other, quiche is OK. Just don't ask 
them to cook it. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years of women's liberation may have brought equality in the workplace, 
even treatment by the world outside and the unquestionable right of a woman to 
buy a man lunch, but they have failed miserably to dent traditional male 
prejudices in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Men's aversion to housework remains as strong as ever, even when wives are 
giving them dusters. 
</P>
<P>
I have had my suspicions about this lurking injustice during moments of slaving 
over a hot stove. But I now know it is true: An American sociologist says so. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh picture of how husbands behave in two-income families where the wives 
are balancing career, children and the cooking comes from UC Berkeley Prof. 
Arlie Hochschild on the strength of 10 years peering into the lives of American 
households. 
</P>
<P>
In the households Hochschild describes there are sinks full of unwashed dishes, 
piles of bone-dry unironed laundry and dog-eared permission slips for school 
outings long since past. Resentment smolders amid these symbols of a stalled 
revolution where women have won the right to work outside the home but have not 
yet persuaded their husbands to work inside it. Her all too real-life women 
characters struggle to organize their homes while their other halves watch TV. 
Worse, one of them even gets up early not to dress the children but to play 
with his model trains. 
</P>
<P>
Perfectly nice men who would not dream of opening doors for women or calling 
their female colleagues a patronizing "love" turn into old-fashioned monsters 
once inside the front door. The gender barriers go up; they can almost be seen 
calling for their carpet slippers. Some even believe they are sharing the 
housework. Didn't I mend the light bulb for you last week? 
</P>
<P>
Hochschild may have spent evenings in Los Angeles watching women who pull off 
million-dollar deals in the day struggle to unstick the rice unaided at night, 
but her message is universal. In a world of dishes to be washed, children to be 
dressed and dustbins to be taken out, men are not pulling their weight. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of stuff on which modern domestic disputes thrive. As one 
American reviewer said, disgruntled women need no longer write a note that 
says: "I am leaving. Your dinner is in the oven." They will simply let drop a 
copy of the Hochschild thesis. 
</P>
<P>
The title of "The Second Shift" (Viking) is a swipe at the extra schedule that 
women face in doing the housework and looking after the kids once they come 
home. On the basis that writers succeed when they reinforce their readers' 
existing prejudices, this is damning evidence of female double time, which 
women will warm to and men will dismiss or turn on the telly to avoid reading. 
Dangle a stopwatch over the daily round of dual-income families, and it turns 
out that women work an extra month a year of 24-hour days than the men. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is serious sociology as only Americans can produce -- Hochschild 
seems to have spent the last decade on sitting room floors playing with 
children for an ant's eye view of how their parents divide up the household 
chores -- the sort of excuses that men make for putting off their share have 
lofty labels such as "gender ideology," and her couples face crises like "the 
nurturance crunch." The ray of hope for men in this book is that there are a 
whole new set of excuses to trot out for not mucking in at home. 
</P>
<P>
How about claiming it is a statement against their mothers, or fear of becoming 
a doormat husband when next faced with cooking supper? 
</P>
<P>
Men's attitudes to their working spouses are traditional, transitional or 
egalitarian, but few make it as far as forsaking their newspaper in favor of 
washing the kitchen floor. The worst kind are transitionals who pay lip service 
to equal roles and still have their noses buried in the sports pages. 
</P>
<P>
Beaming in the background is the advertisers' image of the working mother "who 
has it all," who sweeps across her landscape hair flying in the wind from such 
upward mobility. She holds a briefcase in one hand, a child (clean) in the 
other. She is confident, active and liberated and, on the evidence of this 
book, she does not exist. The problem is that while it is no longer compulsory 
or even fashionable to try to be Superwoman, mere existence has to continue, 
and that is difficult enough. Look underneath the surface (undusted) of the 
average dual-income household and the have-it-alls are suffering overload. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing short of complete social upheaval, or at least the end of televised 
football, seems destined to achieve Hochschild's vision of the future and free 
women from their own apron strings. In the meantime, the rest of us had better 
reach for a Chinese take-out meal.

<P>
Eileen Allen marches back and forth along the edge of the swimming pool, 
barking out orders on the loudspeaker. At age 74, she's a formidable drill 
sergeant in a black swimsuit. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen or so women, swim caps pulled tightly over their gray hair and plastic 
clips on their noses, paddle around the pool in a perfect circle. They extend 
their arms in unison, roll over into a somersault and bob back up for air. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop! Stop!" commands Allen, interrupting the exercise. She has spotted a 
stray swimmer floating out of formation. 
</P>
<P>
"You're way ahead of everybody!" she admonishes. 
</P>
<P>
"She can't hear you," comes the response from the pool. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the Army, it's the Aquadettes, and the wayward swan isn't the only 
one who's hard of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 residents of Leisure World in Laguna Hills belong to the synchronized 
swimming troupe. Although most Aquadettes are in their late 70s, they don 
sequin-trimmed bathing suits and plunge into the pool to perform their water 
ballet like extras in an Esther Williams movie. 
</P>
<P>
Two of their younger members, Barbara Pedersen and Esther Hutchings -- ages 62 
and 60, respectively -- recently competed in the World Masters Games in Sweden, 
an international Olympics-style competition held once every four years for 
people over 25. Both took second-place medals for synchronized swimming in 
their age group. 
</P>
<P>
While the Aquadettes perform less strenuous routines than seen in competitions, 
they don't practice just for kicks. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Friday, they were hard at work fixing what they call "trouble 
spots" for their annual Aqua Follies held at the Leisure World pool Aug. 24 
through 27. All four of the performances, with 350 seats each, sold out weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People get excited that all these little old ladies in tennis shoes can do 
this," Pedersen says. "We're pretty good. We get out there, get our legs up, 
and it's all set to music and very pretty." 
</P>
<P>
During practice, they work like professional performers. As head coach, Allen 
has the lonely job of whipping everyone into shape. 
</P>
<P>
"You're very unpopular," she says of herself. "But this time of year we don't 
worry about hurt feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if one or more of the Aquadettes floats out of line or misses a cue, 
good-natured squabbling breaks out among the women over who should do what 
when. 
</P>
<P>
"One person went before someone else did and nobody knows who's right," says 
Hutchings, watching the women bicker over the kick-line sequence for the 
"Chorus Line" number. 
</P>
<P>
When they're in sync, the Aquadettes look like an aquatic version of the June 
Taylor Dancers. At the same instant, a dozen legs shoot up out of the water, 
feet flexed, toes pointed. 
</P>
<P>
The Aquadettes range in age from 55 to 87. Three of them are deaf and one is 
recovering from a heart attack and two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most women their age are sitting in front of a TV with a cat in their lap," 
Hutchings says. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Aquadettes engage in what can be a demanding sport at any age. 
</P>
<P>
"We're among the few groups in the world who do this," Hutchings says. "It's a 
hard thing to do. You have to keep from sinking, keep control, get that leg up 
out of the water at a perfect right angle. It takes stamina." 
</P>
<P>
Above the water, arms and legs move gracefully. When submerged, the limbs churn 
like eggbeaters to keep the body afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen and Hutchings found synchronized swimming at the competitive level to 
be even more intense. At the World Games earlier this month, they had to 
perform more complicated stunts. They would carry out two or three movements 
instead of one while holding their breath under water. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got done with our duet, our tongues hung down to our toenails," 
Pedersen says. 
</P>
<P>
They began training seriously in November with the Meraquas of Irvine, a group 
of synchronized swimmers who train for competition. Of the 60 or so Meraquas, 
Pedersen and Hutchings are the only two in the masters category. The others 
range in age from 8 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
In Sweden they competed against 119 swimmers from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to receiving second-place medals for figures (six individual 
stunts) they won a fourth-place prize for their duet. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen received a fifth-place medal for her solo in the 60- to 69-year-old 
age group. Hutchings received fourth place for her solo in the 40- to 
59-year-old age group (competitors were grouped according to their ages as of 
Dec. 31, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been athletic," says Hutchings, "and for the first time I can do 
something reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge, and if you don't have a challenge when you're 60, you go to 
pot." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen, too, has found synchronized swimming to be the perfect sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us the fun of competition without the stress on our bodies," she 
says. "Plus, I'm a bit of a ham." 
</P>
<P>
Aquadettes perform a more relaxed ballet. They're in it for the camaraderie, 
not the competition. They form lasting friendships. Besides, swimming lowers 
their blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a swimmer and I was a competitive diver. It's good exercise. 
It keeps you limber," says Helen Balch, 71, who will perform in her 14th 
Aquadette show. 
</P>
<P>
Aquadettes must be residents of the Leisure World retirement community. That's 
the only requirement for joining the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can do it," Pedersen says. "We have women who have learned to swim at 
Leisure World, and we've had former Olympic swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
They have been performing since 1965, almost as long as Leisure World has been 
in existence. At their upcoming show, they will pay tribute to the community's 
25th birthday by assembling an eight-foot birthday cake, complete with lit 
candles.

YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN, BUT IT WON'T BE QUITE WHAT IT WAS

lives in Newport Beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
When I was growing up, my father and I often drove west 700 miles along 
Interstate 40 to visit our relatives. We lived on the East Coast -- in New York 
City -- and my father thought it was important to travel to Indiana, where he 
had grown up, where the Hastings family was rooted. We would always walk by the 
house he had lived in as a boy -- a white-frame bungalow like thousands of 
others in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Gee, the place has shrunk," he would say, "and I don't remember the streets 
being so narrow." We would see the cousins and aunts and uncles who remained in 
Indianapolis and who still gathered each Sunday after church for dinner. We ate 
fried chicken and sipped iced tea, then lingered over homemade peach or apple 
pie. Evenings, we would catch a minor-league ballgame or drive downtown to 
watch the colored fountains in the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing exciting, but when I recall those years, it's those August trips with 
my father that I remember best -- through Harrisburg, Pa., Wheeling, W. Va., 
and Columbus, Ohio, past cornfields that rose high in the summer heat, looking 
for the next Burma Shave sign, knowing that when we arrived, we were back home 
-- where we had come from. 
</P>
<P>
When my son turned 16, he began to drive, the phone rang even more, and the 
close-knit crowd he had known since kindergarten didn't hang around the house 
so much. He began camping and skiing in the Sierra Nevada and surfing at Rincon 
in Ventura County and down in Baja. I watched my role as parent wind down and 
wondered what was left unsaid, undone. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I realized, we had never made that drive to Indiana. Death and divorce 
have chipped away much of our sense of family. And our few remaining relatives 
always visit us in California. It became important to me to make that drive 
soon. I raised the question gently; it isn't easy to lure a surfer from the 
ocean in August, with its promise of huge swells from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
We cleaned out our van and loaded it with duffels and a canvas bag filled with 
road maps and travel guides. We headed east on the Costa Mesa Freeway late one 
evening to avoid the desert heat. Seen from the start of our 2,500-mile 
journey, the freeway became unfamiliar, making us feel disconnected from the 
casual flow of Saturday night traffic. 
</P>
<P>
We took turns at the wheel. The driver chose the music. Time seemed to shimmer 
in the asphalt as we cruise-controlled the length of Utah on a bright and dusty 
Sunday. That evening, in Jackson, Wyo., the wood-planked sidewalks were crowded 
with tourists like us. But the Grand Tetons rose dramatically out of their 
golden valley, and we agreed that this was a corner of the country we wanted to 
see again. 
</P>
<P>
The West was especially dry, and deer, bison and antelope frequented the 
road-hugging creeks and canyons we passed. They were looking for water, we 
figured. We picked up Interstate 70 outside of Yellowstone, passing through 
rolling hills and small towns. Here, life would be a lot different from the 
fast pace we kept in California. A friend had sent along Garrison Keillor's 
"Tales of Lake Wobegon" tapes, and I played them as we crossed the great, dark 
prairie one night. 
</P>
<P>
One sleepy morning in Mitchell, S.D., we stopped at the world's only Corn 
Palace, a building faced with a complicated mosaic of ears of corn and prairie 
grasses. Its paisley facade looked exotic -- almost Byzantine -- perched in 
this quiet town in the middle of the flatlands. 
</P>
<P>
My son was at the wheel when we hit the rush hour in Chicago. The city's noise 
jangled after the miles of mountains and plains. We headed for Comiskey Park to 
see the White Sox play. Traffic was stop-and-go, so we left the freeway to save 
time -- a mistake, because we wound up lost in Cicero. By the time we pulled 
into the dirt lot across from the stadium, the game was beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven bucks," said the parking attendant. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven bucks?" 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't Disneyland, folks," he said, with a nod at our California plates. 
We paid. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, we pulled into Fennville, Mich., where our cousin John lives by 
the edge of a woods. We slept in old iron beds, under patchwork quilts made by 
a long-deceased great-aunt. John took us out to McClure's Apple Farm for lunch. 
The barn, a dining hall now, has sat there 50 years or more in the midst of its 
own orchard. Rusted road signs, photographs and worn-out farm implements are 
nailed to the walls wherever there's space. We ordered the apple pie a la mode 
that McClure's is famous for, drank freshly crushed cider, sat back and 
relaxed. John entertained with stories -- edited and embellished -- of his 
college days at Purdue. Then we said our goodbys and headed south toward 
Indianapolis and Aunt Mary. The state roads squared off neatly into fields and 
forests, drawing us deeper into the heart of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Mary said she was delighted to see us. She was apologetic about the front 
yard, because the sugar maple that stood in the center for the half-century she 
has lived there had to be taken out last autumn. A maple blight is moving 
through the Midwest, killing the big, old trees. She feels the yard looks bare 
without it, though we found her garden, which she still tends herself at age 
79, to be fragrant with roses and packed with ripening tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, we drove by my father's old house. Its white paint was weathered, 
and the fence, of a lacy wire seldom seen anymore, was torn. The house looked 
small. Later we sat on Aunt Mary's porch to catch the breeze. We realized, 
though we didn't want to admit it, how much time had gone by. She recalled a 
childhood visit to a graveyard in Freedom, south of town about an hour, where a 
great-grandfather was buried. She was sure that was where the Hastings family 
had settled when they had moved west from Connecticut in the early 1800s. We 
decided to drive down. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, we stopped in Spencer, the county seat. The library has a 
well-stocked genealogical section, and we leafed through the old records -- 
births and marriages and deaths penned carefully into leather and cardboard 
ledgers. We discovered that our family had settled in Owen County during the 
1840s. An Allen Hastings had been fined a dollar for assault and profanity in 
1848. Later, he lost his farm in a mercantile venture with his son-in-law and 
lived out his days in the county asylum for the poor. And in a local history 
book, we read that the Rev. Wiley Hastings was pastor of the Freedom Christian 
Church for many years. 
</P>
<P>
We tramped through an old cemetery, cut into the side of a hill overlooking 
Freedom, searching for the gravestone of this great-grandfather. It had taken 
an hour of inquiry at the general store and post office to find the cemetery, 
which has been all but overgrown. Decades of weather had blurred the granite 
monuments, and we finally left, our legs all weed-scratched, without success. 
But we believed a Hastings was there somewhere, and that seemed enough. 
</P>
<P>
At Aunt Mary's that evening, we sipped iced tea and thanked her for her 
hospitality. My aunt had stayed in the town she had been born and raised in, 
and her heritage was an unquestioned part of her life. But for myself, who has 
wandered from coast to coast, and my son, who has grown up in a beach town that 
has become a yuppie mecca, this journey had been one of discovery. We had 
experienced a large chunk of America from a close-up, road's-eye point of view. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, we had slowed down our lives and considered where our family had 
come from and what that meant. My son said that the trip had been like one to 
Lake Wobegon, "only ours was real." I said that I had confidence in his 
driving, that now he could drive anywhere. "I know that," he said. It was time 
to head home.

FAMILY LIFE: HOMECOMING FOR CHANDRA WIDODO PRAJITNO KOESOEMODIPRODJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 14 years ago this month that Chandra Widodo Prajitno Koesoemodiprodjo 
came into our lives and changed them forever. 
</P>
<P>
His has never been the same, either. 
</P>
<P>
Chandra, or C.W. as we called him (he never did understand the great sense of 
accomplishment felt by those who mastered his last name), was a tall, gangling 
18-year-old who had never been far from the very protective arms of his mother 
in Bogor on the island of Java. 
</P>
<P>
A month earlier, we had answered the urgent appeal of the headmaster at our 
son's school. Another family had been forced to back out of an agreement to 
take an AFS student for a year and the paper process was irretrievably churning 
along somewhere. There was the distinct possibility that a foreign student 
would be traveling a long way to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Our only real concern in volunteering was that exchange students are normally 
placed in a home that has a child the same age. Our son was only 12, so we 
sought the counsel of the then-current AFS student, a rake from Costa Rica who 
was the teddy bear of every teen-age girl within a six-mile radius -- and the 
nightmare of every one of their fathers who had ever seen a Fernando Lamas 
film. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would rather have been placed in a home with a younger or older 
child, that he thought it was asking a lot of any American high school senior 
to share the biggest year of his life with an exotic visitor guaranteed 
everything from local press to a special spot in the school yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
So we filled out the papers, went through all the interviews, painted the spare 
room, read up on Indonesia and Islam -- and worried that we'd made a terrible, 
terrible mistake. 
</P>
<P>
That fear became a conviction when he arrived two weeks earlier than expected. 
He was terrified and so were we. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke almost no English, even though the information packet provided by AFS 
said he was proficient in the language (our suspicions had been aroused, but 
only mildly, by the letter of recommendation from his English teacher that said 
he "shoes grait interest in meny tings"). 
</P>
<P>
We, of course, spoke no Indonesian. Our son was away at camp and we seemed 
incapable of breaking the ice alone. Chandra sat in his room and furiously 
wrote in his dairy. ("I want to go home. This place is awful." Things like 
that, we later learned.) 
</P>
<P>
We then made his life even more miserable by sending him off on a two-week-long 
Explorer Scout trek in the High Sierras. His information packet said he was 
involved in Scouting, but the temperate highlands of Java are a far cry from 
the snow-covered Sierras. He lost 15 pounds from his already-spare frame and 
spent a lot of time on the trip looking for a land bridge back to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
That was the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Chandra came home last week and brought his bride of two weeks. He may have 
been more nervous this time than he was in 1975, so anxious was he for family 
approval. He needn't have worried; he made a fine choice. My new 
daughter-in-law is lovely, bright, sweet and, like him, calls me Dad. If all 
goes well, I should be a grandfather within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
What transpired in that year so long ago that transformed Chandra from a 
stranger in our midst to a full-fledged, important member of the family? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure I know, but it's a phenomenon experienced by most people who open 
their homes and hearts to foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, we were not alone. AFS and most similar programs have strong 
support groups for the students and host families. 
</P>
<P>
The students in the area get together once a week to compare notes, talk about 
their problems and share experiences. So do the host parents and siblings. In 
addition, each AFS student has what is called a "family friend," an adult who 
is available on a confidential basis for any help required. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes -- though not very often -- the match isn't right and the student 
is placed in a different home. 
</P>
<P>
In our case, Chandra's attendance at a small private boys' school was helpful 
too. There were only about 20 members of the senior class, so we had them all 
over for a get-acquainted party and served Indonesian food. 
</P>
<P>
We traveled a bit too, before the school term began, hitting nearby cities and 
tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
By the time classes started, we seemed to have settled in. An only child 
himself, Chandra took particular delight in the antics of a sometimes 
incorrigible younger brother, and our son was enormously proud when Chandra 
made the football team. 
</P>
<P>
He was able, soccer-style, to kick 50-yard field goals, and even though he 
wound up as all-state punter, I'm not sure to this day he understands the rules 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when he was called in with only a few seconds left on the clock to save 
the game, the coach said to me: "He knew there was a crisis; he just didn't 
know what it was." 
</P>
<P>
The year that began so slowly suddenly picked up speed after Christmas. We all 
knew the time was nearing for Chandra to return to Indonesia, but we didn't 
talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
We just tried to cram as much living and as many experiences as we could, 
making sure he got to see San Francisco, Big Sur, Mexico, the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Then, it was over and we all gathered at the airport to see Chandra and his 
fellow AFS students off. There were a lot of tears, from both students and 
families. At some point, Chandra said he was sad, but "I don't cry." 
</P>
<P>
Within days, a letter arrived postmarked Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in which he 
confessed that when the plane left Hawaii, he had become inconsolable and that 
he had cried for hours. 
</P>
<P>
He was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
In the years between, he wrote, we wrote. He called, we called. We exchanged 
gifts and shared problems. We watched in dismay as cultural tradition delayed 
his marriage for years; he was equally dismayed when my own marriage fell 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
We just do all the things families do, including staging some joyous reunions.

Odetics Earnings -- For the first quarter of fiscal 1990, Odetics Inc. reported 
net income of $36,000. The year-earlier figure was $438,000, which included a 
$400,000 credit from an accounting change. An earnings report in Friday's paper 
reversed the first quarter net incomes for fiscal 1990 and 1989.

ANGELS RISE TO CHALLENGE WITH MINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the grand scheme of baseball's long summer, they were four rather 
inconsequential outs. They came against Cleveland, during the middle innings, 
during the middle of August. 
</P>
<P>
So why did they bring a crowd of reporters to the threshold of Greg Minton's 
locker stall in the wake of the Angels' 6-5 victory over the Indians Friday 
night? 
</P>
<P>
Consider it a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in more than three weeks, Minton completed his relief round 
without allowing either: 
</P>
<P>
(a) A home run; 
</P>
<P>
(b) A barrage of base hits, or 
</P>
<P>
(c) A game to get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first 39 games this year, I did my job," Minton said. "In the last 
four, I not only didn't do my job, I was terrible . . . I was almost out of the 
league after four games." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the slump covered seven games, dating back to July 27. Since then, 
Minton had surrendered 10 runs and 17 hits, including three home runs. Over the 
course of 7 2/3 innings, that works out to an 11.74 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
So when Minton takes the mound for the eighth time and retires all four batters 
he faces -- striking out three of them -- it's news. 
</P>
<P>
It's news even if Minton keeps t elling the huddled mass surrounding him, 
"Don't make no big deal out of this. This was only 1/3 innings." 
</P>
<P>
With those 1 1/3 innings, Minton not only gained a victory for himself, he also 
helped regain first place for the Angels. Coupled with Oakland's 4-3 loss to 
Minnesota, Friday's victory before 52,286 fans at Anaheim Stadium enabled the 
Angels to move .002 ahead of the Athletics in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
For both Minton and the Angels, it was a night of reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Minton got the call to work middle relief when Angel starter Jim Abbott 
required a sixth-inning bailout. Abbott had just yielded a run-scoring single 
to Felix Fermin, enabling the Indians to forge a 5-5 tie with two out. 
</P>
<P>
Minton came on and immediately stopped the threat by striking out Brook Jacoby. 
Then, he completed a perfect seventh inning, striking out Mike Young and Joey 
Belle in the process. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Angel Manager Doug Rader turned the ball over to Bryan Harvey, 
who helped continue the Angel bullpen revival. Harvey recorded his 19th save by 
finishing two hitless innings, walking two and striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Minton (2-3) was credited with the victory. He was the pitcher of record when 
Claudell Washington tripled off Indian reliever Steve Olin (1-1) in the seventh 
and scored on a single by Johnny Ray, breaking a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third hit of the night for Ray, who also hit a home run off 
Cleveland starter Tom Candiotti in the third inning, one out after Devon White 
had done the same. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, who lasted only three-plus innings in his previous start, was ragged 
again at the outset Friday. He had two wild pitches in the first inning, gave 
up five hits in the first two innings and was down, 3-0, before he recorded his 
fourth out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Jerry Browne opened the game with a single and, two wild pitches 
later, was standing at third base, watching Abbott walk the Indians' No. 2 
hitter, Felix Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
This was cause for concern in the Angel dugout, bringing pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann to the mound for his earliest visit of the season, barely five 
minutes into the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Conference finished, Abbott came back to strike out Jacoby, but soon regressed. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter and Young followed with consecutive singles, each scoring a run, to 
give Cleveland a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly became 3-0 in the second inning. Brad Komminsk led off by tripling 
into the left-field corner -- the ball short-hopping the fence and bounding 
past Angel left fielder Chili Davis -- and scored on a single by Andy Allanson. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Abbott began to settle down. He retired eight of the next nine 
batters he faced before serving up a two-out home run to Browne in the fourth 
inning. He almost yielded another to Belle in the fifth, but this time, Davis 
got a good jump, leaping to glove the ball as it was about to clear the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott failed to make it out of the sixth inning, however. He gave up a two-out 
double to Allanson, followed by a walk to Browne and a run-scoring single by 
Fermin. That brought Lachemann to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
On came Minton to end the inning and on went the Angels, getting Washington's 
triple followed by Ray's decisive single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Minton, for more than one reason, was happy to have a part in making it all 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, I finally did my job," Minton said. "Now, if I can keep 
doing it, you can take all the stuff that's been printed in the newspapers 
about our bullpen and -- no offense, gentlemen -- shove it." 
</P>
<P>
Minton laughed as he said it. The smile, along with his old form, had finally 
returned, at least for one night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield update: The injured Angel shortstop is scheduled to have his 
left hand re-examined next Thursday by Dr. Norman Zemel, a hand and wrist 
specialist. Originally expected to be sidelined two to four weeks, Schofield 
said that prognosis has since been revised to three to six weeks. In the 
meantime, Schofield said: "The doctor said to do nothing until it heals. Right 
now, I'm sitting and watching a lot of baseball. But I really don't like to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
Still limited to designated-hitting duty when he's able to play, Claudell 
Washington tested his left shoulder by throwing for 10 minutes before Friday's 
game. "It feels good," Washington reported. 
</P>
<P>
They stoop to conquer (almost): The idea was to treat hot-foot master Bert 
Blyleven to a little of his own medicine, which, certainly, has been overdue. 
But two attempts were foiled Friday when an Angel batboy and Cleveland's Joe 
Carter both failed to ambush Blyleven while he was conducting a television 
interview. The bat boy went first, but Blyleven spotted the sneak attack in 
progress and turned around to stare down the perpetrator. Carter came closer, 
crawling on all fours, from batting cage to Angel dugout, where Blyleven was 
standing. Carter then lit a match and touched it to a shoelace, but the flame 
didn't take. As Carter lit another match, Blyleven, without looking, took his 
right foot and nonchalantly kicked dirt in Carter's face.
